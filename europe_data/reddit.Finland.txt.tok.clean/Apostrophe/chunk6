  i think finland and sweden should jointly re-militarize \u00c5land . 
  put some military airfields there that both countries can use , it is a very good strategic location and we 're wasting it for no reason . 
  please become a politician . 
  the moscow times is written and edited by liberal , pro-western russians and marketed towards westerns living in russia . 
  while most of russian media works hard to paint a very beautiful picture of russia , these guys do n't give a fuck . 
  putin acting like a dick ? 
  these guys say putin is a dick . 
  because of this , many pro-putin russians absolutely * hate * the moscow times . 
  back when they had a comments-sections , it was full angry comments calling them cia-employees , whores of the west , traitors and all sorts of similar things . 
   the nordic state that 's come last nine times since 1961 . 
  so proud . 
  you 'd be amazed by the amount of non-nordic people who seem to think that finland won the winter war . 
  it is so weird . 
  i mean , sure , we survived - which is a kind victory in and of itself - but still ... 
   necessary to grant people refuge from war and persecution , but ... 
  most of the migrants are not fleeing war or persecution . 
  they are simply coming because they see better economic opportunities . 
  traditionally , this has been called * `` illegal immigration '' * and has been fought against because it is damaging to the economic opportunities of the native population . 
  now the illegal immigrants have noticed that europe does n't have the strength to stop them from coming over illegally , so they are coming as fast as they can . 
  we 'll have to wait and see how this ends . 
  to the modern leftist it is far more important to be ** anti-right-wing ** than anything else . 
  the right is against unmitigated immigration . 
  hence , the left must be in favor of unmitigated immigration . 
  simple , really . 
  basking in the warm glow of self-righteousness and moral superiority is less admirable when you consider the fact that it comes at the cost of setting europe on fire . 
  also , sexual harrasment crimes are up 820 % . 
  i swear we could replace eurovision with a pan-european burping contest and still come up looking more dignified . 
  the swedish green party is environmentalist . 
  at least it was , originally . 
  in the past few decades they 've embraced left-leaning thinking as an increasingly important core ideology , so they 've become a left-wing party more so than a * green * party . 
  this has lead to an increase in focus on social justice issues and identity politics , as well as a full-throated embrace of what they call * tolerance * and multi-culturalism . 
  specifically , they view having anti-immgration and anti-islamic views to be `` right-wing '' so they 've emphasized tolerance of immigration and islam . 
  basically , they 've turned from an environmentalist party in to a left-wing progressive party . 
  so , what has happened is that recently a few muslim politicians of the green party - [ mehmet kaplan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehmet_kaplan ) and [ yasri khan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yasri_khan ) - have resigned . 
  [ first this guy ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20160418/swedens-housing-minister-quits-after-row ) . 
  [ and then this guy . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20160420/swedish-politician-quits-after-refusing-to-shake-womens-hands ) some people in sweden are rather angry about these cases , because they seem to demonstrate that even muslims who have lived in sweden for a long time have n't integrated and absorbed swedish values . 
  in the case of the second man , he was actually * born * in sweden and still refuses to integrate to mainstream society to the point that he refuses to shake hands with women . 
  and he is supposed to be a prime example of a model , integrated muslim - as he is the head of * swedish muslims for peace and justice * . 
  in addition to this , [ a green party politician ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85sa_romson ) recently referred to the 9/11 attacks as the [ 9/11 accidents ] ( http://nypost.com/2016/04/19/swedish-deputy-pm-calls-911-an-accident/ ) , which of course does n't sound so great . 
  this is the same politician who [ openly wept ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/24/asa-romson-sweden-deputy-prime-minister-cries-announcing-refugee-u-turn-video ) when she had to announce that sweden would reduce immigration . 
  this shows just how much europe has regressed in the past few years : treating women as equal human beings is a topic under active discussion - and there is a sizeable number of the population that are against the idea . 
  just think about that for a moment . 
  in the sixties we had the pill and a sexual revolution . 
  now we 're talking about shaking hands . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  here is the text of the article - and i have highlighted a part that might become controversial :  germany has announced new legal measures requiring migrants and refugees to integrate into society in return for being allowed to live and work in the country . 
    under the coalition government 's measures , announced on thursday morning , asylum seekers face cuts to support if they reject mandatory integration measures such as language classes or lessons in german laws or cultural basics . 
    according to the german chancellor , angela merkel , the aim of germany 's first ever integration law is to make it easier for asylum seekers to gain access to the german labour market , with the government promising 100,000 new `` working opportunities '' , expected to include low-paid workfare jobs . 
    ** a law requiring employers to give preference to german or eu job applicants over asylum seekers will be suspended for three years . 
  **   the vice-chancellor , sigmar gabriel , described the agreement as a historic step , saying he was convinced that `` in a few years ' time this law will be seen as a milestone for our immigration law '' . 
   more than 476,000 asylum applications were registered in germany in 2015 , with officials putting the total number of arrivals at over a million . 
   yet the number of asylum seekers arriving in central europe has dropped off considerably in recent weeks due to balkan countries sealing off their borders and the european union and turkey agreeing on a deal to return refugees arriving in greece . 
   germany announced earlier this month that the number of refugees entering the country via austria had dropped off seven-fold . 
  switzerland said on thursday the number of people seeking asylum in the country had dropped for the fourth consecutive month , with officials registering 1,992 requests in march , roughly 25 % fewer than in february . 
   `` the reason for this development is the continuous decline of migration via the balkan route , '' the swiss migration office said . 
  `` since march , affected countries along the balkan route have brought transit traffic to a virtual standstill . ''  on thursday austria announced it was ready to step up measures to discourage people from making the journey to europe from countries such as afghanistan , iraq and syria . 
   defence minister hans peter doskozil told austrian broadcaster orf that his country would close off the brenner pass border crossing if italy refused to accept people turned back by austria . 
   austria has announced a cap of 37,500 asylum applications for 2016 . 
  after receiving about 90,000 applications for asylum last year , the country has so far registered between 16,000 and 17,000 applications in 2016 . 
  sanctuary or ghetto ? 
  how mannheim created a ` city within a city ' for refugees read more  doskozil expressed skepticism about the eu-turkey agreement , saying : `` we do n't know how long the deal will last . ''  while the numbers of people arriving in central europe have dropped off , witnesses report desperate scenes in camps on either side of the mediterranean . 
   the president of the european council , donald tusk , warned on wednesday that `` alarming '' numbers of potential migrants were gathering in libya to cross the mediterranean . 
  around 4,000 people were rescued from the mediterranean between libya and sicily on monday and tuesday . 
   pope francis will visit a camp on saturday on the greek island of lesbos , where hundreds of thousands of refugees have arrived via the sea from turkey in the past year . 
  the island is at the centre of the controversial refugee deal between the eu and turkey . 
   `` during his visit , francis will shed light on the crucial role of local and international solidarity to help some of the most vulnerable people amid the refugee crisis , '' said gauri van gulik , deputy director for europe at amnesty international . 
   `` but he must also speak out about the violations , fear and uncertainty suffered by thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in limbo on lesbos and elsewhere in greece . ''  vatican spokesman federico lombardi told reporters the pope would make the visit to call `` all communities of believers to solidarity and responsibility '' amid a `` situation of intense suffering '' . 
  yeah , the idiocy of saving a lot money by exporting an expensive refugee problem abroad . 
  what a fool would consider such a thing ? 
  there are millions of refugees and migrants currently in turkey . 
  what if erdogan , being the douchebag that he is , decides to send them all to europe ? 
  allow immigrants free passage through ? 
  why would anyone in europe wish to antagonize erdogan at a time like this . 
  idiots . 
  truthfully , the sanctions have had little to do with the economic troubles of russia . 
  the low energy prices are really to blame , not the sanctions . 
  that was exactly my point : they are n't planning to * put the nation through an event * , they are complaining that no one is going to fix anything unless there is an * event * . 
  the quotes posted contain no reference to plotting anything , just whining that nothing is being done . 
  that is exactly what i noticed as well . 
  these guys are not * `` plotting an event '' * , they are moaning about the fact that no one will take action unless there is a dire , imminent catastrophe . 
  the article is simply dishonest . 
  one must read kant , ** but one must not fall into delusions about already living in a world of perpetual peace , universal democracy and international cooperation . 
  i wish we were , truly . 
  ** islamic extremism is happy to exploit our illusions of already living in kant 's golden age . 
  you know things are going badly wrong when even a lunatic like erdogan can see the problems coming better than our own leaders . 
  what a time to be alive ...

  here is what happened : 1 . 
  russia took crimea and fucked up eastern ukraine . 
  the eu was like * `` bro , whattafuck ?!,
