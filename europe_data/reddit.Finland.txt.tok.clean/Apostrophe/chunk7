  no more food exports to russia . 
  farmers go broke . 
  and now the farmers are like * `` the fuck ?!, 
  why are we being slapped around ?!, 
  fuck these sanctions !, 
  '' * hence , tractors in helsinki . 
  if your government enacted a policy that caused the demand for your work to artificially disappear , would n't you ask the government to maybe undo that policy ? 
  the sanctions are causing russian counter-sanctions . 
  specifically , russian counter-sanctions target the agricultural sector . 
  russia has banned the importation of food from the eu . 
  this hurts farmers most of all - and they were n't doing all that well even beforehand . 
  thus , tractors . 
   if my job stops paying the bills i 'm not going to move my computer on the town square and demonstrate ... ... but these people are demonstrating against the government policy of sanctions against russia , which is what is causing their economic problems . 
  would n't you even consider demonstrating against the government if it was government policy causing your job to stop paying the bills ? 
  okay , say you are a farmer . 
  you reduce milk output by 50 % . 
  your income is now down an extra 50 % from an amount that was already too low to live on . 
  next ? 
  summer just means better weather and more migrants ... 
  * woosh !, 
  i would like to visit both russia and ukraine . 
  i am very interested in both and wish to gain a true understanding of both . 
  currently learning russian . 
  ^ fucking ^ verbs , ^ how ^ do ^ they ^ work ?!? 
  trailer park boys ** is ** finland . 
  the only solution is to limit entry to just ** women , children and families ** - single males should be turned back at the border . 
  [ finnish news ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/rajahdys_turkkilaisessa_kulttuurikeskuksessa_ruotsissa/8681306 ) says it happened in a `` turkish cultural center '' and that no one was hurt . 
  ( link in finnish ), 
  winland and bestonia - gloriously weird together, 
  [ the finnish way of drinking - english subtitles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nal9oygyxog ), 
  ... but you do realize that the comments here ** condemn ** the reactionary right-wing violence ? 
  i would argue that the police are not weak , but are limited by weak laws . 
  but ... ** does n't that make it worse ? 
  ** we know the attacks were committed by arab and north-african men . 
  if the attacks were not done by recent migrants , then it must have been the arab and north-african men that have already been in europe for some time . 
  # that would mean that they have completely failed to absorb european values . 
  that would mean that integration has completely failed . 
  at least here in finland , they do - ** in public places ** . 
  the possession of any item that the police decide is * `` intended to do harm '' * is a crime . 
  so , knives , daggers , pepper spray , batons , etc. 
  if you carry a * can of hairspray * and the police are of the opinion that you 're carrying that hairspray for the purpose of using it as a * weapon * , you 've committed a crime . 
  nowhere near legal in most european countries , in fact . 
  very much illegal here in finland . 
  i think you would be punished far more severely for carrying a knife than pepper spray . 
  let us all take a moment to enjoy a mental image of timo soini in ugg boots . 
   let 's be honest - if you thought a party literally represented the views of adolf hitler , would you want to let them into a debate ? 
  ** yes , absolutely !, 
  ** it is vital for a healthy and functioning democracy for all viewpoints to be openly shared and discussed . 
  and honestly , i think nazism is ** not ** popular with the european people and public exposure would utterly decimate the support of any party that would advocate for it . 
  such things only grow in shadows !, 
  sunlight is the best disinfectant . 
  and thirdly , i think this migration crisis was brought on by left-leaning politics . 
  to exclude the right wing from debates would simply be unfair , unsportsmanlike and downright * dishonorable * . 
  when you fuck up , you do n't get to ban the opposition from criticizing you and still get to call yourself `` european '' or `` liberal '' . 
  that kind of shit belongs in totalitarian states , not a proper democracy . 
  what are you babbling about ? 
  i said nothing of agreement . 
  i just think it is insane to object to people taking part in the discussion . 
  a political party with support hovering around the ten percent mark ca n't simply be excluded from the discussion . 
  that way madness lies . 
   according to a weekend survey by `` bild , '' roughly 53 percent of people asked want afd to appear in the debate . 
  wtf ? 
  how can this number possibly be this low ? 
  how can so many people wish to sideline and silence a political viewpoint simply because they disagree with it ? 
  disgraceful . 
  the answer to speech you do n't like is n't * less speech * - it is ** more speech ** . 
   a member of the nut 's ruling national executive , alex kenny , and ian hale , the nut 's assistant secretary in newham , are also involved . 
  in the article . 
  that makes 3 people . 
  i think that the entire western world is infected by a sort of giddy , gleeful exuberance and all politicians and bankers carry themselves with a sense of divine providence . 
  they all think themselves so wise and all-knowing . 
  yet i can not shake this feeling that we are governed by idiots that waltz from fuck-up to fuck-up , smiling like the fools they are . 
  we all live in banana republics now ... 
  ** the truth is that neither estonians nor finns understand the other language all that well without some study . 
  ** you 'll pick out a lot of words that are very similar , but that 's about it . 
  you can , however , learn either language very quickly if you already know the other . 
  they are very close to one another . 
  but not close enough to be mutually intelligible . 
  however , because estonian and finnish are so closely related , sound so very similar and are often - ** but incorrectly ** - stated as an example of a pair of languages that have mutual intelligibility , both estonians and finns have started to assume that the other side must understand them better than they understand the other . 
  so , finns think estonians understand finnish better than finns understand estonian and vice versa . 
  but in reality no one really understands the other side without at least some studying .

  i 'm pretty sure that was a reference to [ life of brian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plzre1kpwzw ), 
  the finnish police say they received a tip that this kind of attack was planned . 
  so they went over to the location and arrested everyone gathered there before anything happened . 
  the politicians are deflecting blame for their own failures . 
  the politicians are deflecting blame to the police for their own failings . 
  if they have no legal residency , they 're just illegal immigrants . 
  enforcing the law does n't make you idi amin . 
  if we only helped women and children , we 'd be able to help an equal amount of people - and there would be far less of this kind of trouble and the racists would be able to gain far less political support . 
  i think if we keep on with the current open borders approach , there is a serious danger of hard-core right-wing racist groups gaining major support . 
  the fact that they arrive on european soil might be difficult to prevent , but i am talking about ** granting refugee status ** and legal right of residency . 
  give status to the women , children and families , send the single men back home . 
  if the canadian approach is implemented , it would have to happen at an eu-level . 
  so , the european union would make the decision , and enforce it . 
  we could consider the canadian solution . 
  the canadian approach is very simple : ** no single men . 
  ** ** women , children and families only .
