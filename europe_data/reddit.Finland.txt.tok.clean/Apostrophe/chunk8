  well , this is an entirely new type of organized , mob sexual-assault . 
  when have you ever read of a mob of men , hundreds strong organizing themselves specifically for the purpose of molesting and robbing women in europe ? 
  so , yes , ** they did bring this new type of sexual assault ** to germany . 
  germany has a problem : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pathological_altruism, 
  ** it should never be a crime to voice an opinion , no matter how unpopular or uncomfortable . 
  smtt, 
   is that finnish ? 
  yup . 
   he 's not drunk , like we where . 
  there 's your problem , 
  i think they 'd give them permit for a very tiny protest , because three or four people protesting something look weak and pathetic . 
  so they might , if they feel like it . 
  on this occasion , they denied the permit . 
  background is rather simple : russia has a constitution that was adopted in 1993 and it affords the citizenry certain rights . 
  some people feel that the government is n't following the constitution and is ignoring the rights of the people . 
  so , on constitution day they went out to protest . 
  and they were arrested because their protest was illegal . 
  ( in russia , you must apply for a permission for your protest . 
  protesting without a permit is a crime . ), 
  sorry i ca n't help with translations , my russian is n't good enough yet , 
  i would assume so . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  the two are suspected of being involved in the [ camp speicher massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camp_speicher_massacre ) that happened a year and a half ago . 
  if you are in france , ** give blood two or three weeks from now !, 
  ** there is always a high initial supply , but blood does n't keep for long . 
  i believe this was removed incorrectly . 
  i posted a link to the main page of the report , which contains many things : the main report . pdf file , various appendices for additional information , passenger information and information about how the investigation was conducted - as well as a video summarizing the findings . 
  what was previously posted was merely a link to the main report . pdf file . 
  i believe the other information , especially the video , merit attention . 
  ( not everyone wants to read a 279 page report but they might find the time for the 20 minute video . ), 
  please consider re-instating this post .

  i think that if you as a white european think that it is your place to waltz into africa because you feel you can do a better job of running those countries than the locals and you need to save them from themselves - then no , * i do n't understand that kind of mentality * . 
  i think this mindset is * crazy * ; some kind of * complex * . 
  what madness . 
  what kind of crazy * white saviour * - complex does this man have ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  mama merkel was just as nuts when she announced the open door policy . 
  jesus christ , a marshall plan for africa . 
  how large an * ego * do you need to even need to come up with that ? 
  ** that is some insane 19th century imperialist thinking . 
  **  take up the white man 's burden , send forth the best ye breed  go bind your sons to exile , to serve your captives ' need ;  to wait in heavy harness , on fluttered folk and wild --  your new-caught , sullen peoples , half-devil and half-child . 
   take up the white man 's burden , in patience to abide ,  to veil the threat of terror and check the show of pride ;  by open speech and simple , an hundred times made plain  to seek another 's profit , and work another 's gain . 
   take up the white man 's burden , the savage wars of peace --  fill full the mouth of famine and bid the sickness cease ;  and when your goal is nearest the end for others sought ,  watch sloth and heathen folly bring all your hopes to nought . 
  i ca n't decide if that would be half as bad or twice as bad , 
  somehow ... 
  * accurate . 
   we 're all just sitting here at a ** safe distance ** observing . 
  i still have n't decided which one i fear more : the idiot or the criminal ... 
  i just do n't understand why people such as her wish to live in the west . 
  she wants to live in an islamic country . 
  why does n't she simply move to saudi arabia or iran or the islamic state ? 
  why stay here ? 
   ... indirect systems rely on tyre vibration and wheel rotations to detect low pressure , while the more effective direct tpms have sensors to accurately measure the pressure in each wheel . 
  why is n't there already a rule that a * `` tyre pressure monitoring system '' * must actually ** monitor the pressure inside the tyre ** ?!?!, 
  unbelievable . 
  i hope the money was donated to charity ... 
  subtle . 
  the left has n't been in charge for a while , but we ca n't deny the fact that for years they 've busied themselves with pandering to political correctness rather than focusing on the interests of the working classes . 
  if the establishment left wants to earn the votes of the working people , they should be rallying against the current influx of immigration from north-africa and the middle-east . 
  but * muh virtue ... * * must * signal ... * muh virtue ... *, 
  finland used to be one of the baltic states as well , until it transitioned in the general consciousness into the nordic sphere . 
  estonian culture and language are very similar to finland , as is their mentality and * `` national character '' * . 
  simply put estonia is just as much a nordic country as finland is . 
  if estonia is n't nordic , then neither is finland . 
  i meant that purely as a joke on the fact that we are quiet and can barely manage to talk to each other , let alone foreigners . 
  i think we may be a bit quiet when compared to , say , the italians , but we are sociable enough , i think . 
  please do not pay any attention to us , dear foreigners . 
  thank you . 
  everyone ** can ** assimilate . 
  it just takes willingness . 
  and the arabs and other muslims - for the most part - are extremely unwilling . 
  the romani people have been in europe for 500 years and they still have n't fully integrated . 
  and we have much more in common with their culture than the arabs . 
  the cost of this [ german guilt ] ( https://youtu.be/5qp06myxd4g?t=130 ) trip will be paid by future generations . 
  this is one of those things i do n't understand : ** why do so many europeans seem to think that these new immigrants will absorb and accept european values ? 
  ** countries like saudi arabia are investing * billions * every year into advancing the fundamentalist agenda , whereas we are investing between * fuck and all * into propagandizing european values - yet everyone i talk to about this seems so comfortably assured that european values will be accepted by these newcomers as surely as the rains will reach the seas . 
  i do n't understand . 
  why would these new immigrants absorb european values when we are making absolutely no demands on them to do so ? 
  hell , we even let foreign nations sponsor mosques on our own soil . 
   how would you even `` close our border '' ? 
  almost impossible task . 
  and most people do n't want it . 
  all that would be necessary to practically end the flow of fake refugees would be a simple declaration that all refugees would be expected to prove that they come from real , war-torn countries and actually are in need of help . 
  if the european union only took in true refugees from syria , the fake refugees would stop attempting to gain entry knowing that they would n't be accepted in and would be deported if caught . 
  simple . 
  note that this is only being suggested because of this :  the draft change follows ** a ruling by germany 's highest court in march 2015 that there was no legal basis to force mothers of so-called `` cuckoo children '' , in german slang , to name the biological father . 
  ** basically , the idea seems to be that when a man is being unjustly being forced to pay for a child that is n't his , the woman should be forced to reveal the true father . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** someone is suggesting that women should be forced to be honest in paternity cases . 
  * `` hey !, 
  my home town is on the front page of / r/europe !, 
  cool !, 
  '' * 0.2 seconds later : * `` oh ... '' *, 
  welcome to / r/europe , where ignoring the muslim immigration problem is irresponsible and not ignoring it is racist . 
  the ira seized violent action because they were able to reach a political compromise .
