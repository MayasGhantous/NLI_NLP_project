  what is your suggested plan towards a political compromise with fundamentalist islam ? 
  they are currently willing to accept either your death or conversion . 
  your counter-offer ? 
  because forced underage marriage is scary as fuck all and the idea that it exists in europe is fucking horrifying ? 
  truth . 
   if that 's the swedish leadership yup , she is the deputy prime minister . 
  this is also the lady who referred to the wtc-attacks as * `` the 9/11-accident . 
  last year : [ swedish politician cries as she announces that sweden will accept fewer immigrants ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkxeualvswc ), 
  imagine how much fun we would be having mocking the americans and their * trump / clinton * - clusterfuck if it were n't for this shit ... 
  eu accession talks with turkey should have ended the minute they pulled out that list of 2700 judges to purge . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-latest-news-erdogan-istanbul-judges-removed-from-duty-failed-government-overthrow-a7140661.html edit : oh , and 8000 police as well . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-dismisses-8000-police-after-failed-coup-judges-military-personnel-recep-tayyip-erdogan/ man , the turks sure did investigate this coup super quickly and find out the guilty in record time !, 
  i think that it can be very impressive , but only in the correct context and when executed with the greatest care . 
  for example , i like this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buffalo_city_court_building, 
   modern catholics have n't heard lutherans called that one before :p, 
  what the heck is going on in ireland ?!? 
  there should be a new episode of * mock the week * tomorrow . 
  gon na be great :p, 
  wow , that is hideous . 
  traditionally when the fighting has a political , religious or other societal motive , we tend to talk about it , yes . 
  for example , if a bunch of drunks have a fistfight in a bar - that is n't news . 
  but if a bunch of neo-nazis attack a synagogue - that is news . 
  it was n't that long ago that politicians here in finland were talking enthusiastically about turkey joining the european union . 
  they are n't talking about that now ... 
  ** w ** inland and ** b ** estonia !, 
  i would guess that they were arrested for a `` political protest action '' . 
  in russia , any political protest of more than one single person needs an official permit . 
  if the policeman was a dick , he could decide that these two leaving flowers and a sign of condolences was a political protest . 
  the gay propaganda law is also possible , but much less likely - that only concerns acts of promoting homosexuality to underage minors . 
  it is difficult to see how leaving flowers and a sign could be seen as promoting homosexuality . 
  [ oh , how sad ... ] ( http://www.philosophers-stone.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jump-you-fuckers.jpg ), 
  i would support this if we also limited the refugees to only real refugees from real war-zones , not opportunists from north africa . 
  and also limited refugees to women , children and families . 
  no single men . 
  then the system you suggest would be right and honorable . 
  * `` this just in : the people in charge of the arab world are indeed in charge of the arab world . 
  more on this as the story develops !, 
  in other news , water found to be wet ... '' *, 
  i love this lady . 
  she is a radical anti-capitalist and a marxist ** and ** she thinks fighting against isis is just as bad as terrorism ** and ** she supported hugo chavez , who fucked up venezuela so profoundly . 
  she strikes me as the rare type of individual who achieves true idiocy in various contrasting flavors . 
  ** and the people who threw the cake at her are even nuttier !, 
  well , sith works too , 
  you mean sith ? 
  sith sibelius ... heheheh ... yeah , you 're right . 
  actually , it is n't such a far-fetched idea . 
  president ? 
  but some kind of political career is perfectly possible . 
  this incident has made her a very well-known figure and a war-hero in ukraine . 
  while she was imprisoned for almost two years , the political scene in ukraine has been a total clusterfuck . 
  the political elite is mired in corruption scandals and their incompetence and weakness is frustrating the nation . 
  in the mean time , she has steadfastly sat in prison and refused to admit any wrongdoing - as she should n't have . 
  but boy does that make the current crop of ukrainian politicians seem like a bunch of weaklings : this woman faced down the putin administration and refused to plea-bargain her way out from under a possible 20-year prison sentence - all the while the ukrainian politicians have been fucking up and hiding their money in panama . 
  this gives her considerable moral clout . 
  she was held in captivity for seven hundred and eight days . 
  that 's a lot of time to think about politics and build up resentment towards her supposed superiors . 
  if she has the inclination and can find a decent team , she has the potential to throw some serious weight around . 
  that all sounds rather wonderful to me . 
  you are basically describing a responsible left-wing that has both a brain to keep their policies practical and non-destructive and a pair of balls to do something about violent extremism and immigrant integration . 
  that sounds bloody delightful , i 'd be totally on board with that . 
  regrettably , most of the left-leaning rhetoric i hear these days is rather a far cry from that . 
  that might sound appealing for a moment , but when you think about it for a bit it would n't be so great . 
  first , the various pirate parties are mostly formed out of political outsiders - people completely new to politics . 
  they also seem to be mostly formed out of technologists - people with some excellent ideas about it privacy laws and patent reform and government regulation of the internet ... but i ca n't see myself trusting these people to handle the illegal migration crisis any better than the current political class . 
  do n't get me wrong , i rather like the pirate party , but i see little reason to believe they will improve matters on this issue . 
  secondly , we have the greens . 
  well , the greens are n't green any more , they are red . 
  after the fall of the soviet union the commies merged leftism into the green movement . 
  they are a far worse option than the pirate party people , who at the very least have plenty of sense . 
  the greens are n't going to do a damn thing about the migrant crisis ; they 're lefty globalist-internationalists who think european taxpayers should pay to save the whole damn earth . 
  they 'll embrace * willkommenskultur * even more enthusiastically than the current lot . 
  there is a great deal to dislike in the right wing - and i certainly hope the power does n't go to the truly far-right - but they are the better option . 
  apparently , quite a few : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/the-world-s-favorite-new-tax-haven-is-the-united-states https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/how-the-u-s-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens/ http://bigstory.ap.org/article/6352562d2bf2487d8e7894f9aa8936a9/us-emerging-tax-haven-alongside-switzerland-caymans http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/06/panama-papers-us-tax-havens-delaware http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/business/how-delaware-thrives-as-a-corporate-tax-haven.html?_r=0, 
  she did refer to the attacks as * `` the 9/11 accident '' * . 
  all discussions are too awkward for finns ... 
  [ swedish comedian robert gustafsson portrays the finnish way of drinking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nal9oygyxog ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_collective_guilt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regressive_left, 
  it should be noted that saying finland legalized same-sex marriage last year makes it sound like finland was very discriminatory towards gay people until last year . 
  this is n't actually true : finland had legal same-sex * partnerships * for a long time before it added same-sex * marriage * . 
  gays had almost all of the rights under registered partnerships as married people . 
   these people would never get visas . 
  then they do not deserve visas . 
  nations have both the right and the obligation to defend themselves . 
  poor little eesti . 
  everyone always forget . 
  always ignore . 
  so sad . 
  but we love . 
  glorious . 
  like finland - but less drunk .

  oh , you 're going to be downvoted by butthurt liberals so hard :p but yes , sadly , you have a point . 
  on this wikipedia page here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis they give the number ** 1,822,260 ** . 
  just search from that number and you can find the chart . 
  apparently this number comes from frontex and there is a link to http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/ given as the source , but that frontex website is so god damn baffling that i ca n't find it . 
  though it should be pointed out that many people say frontex is giving out * soft * numbers to give the impression that they are more in control and doing well . 
   i am not for killing all muslims in europe well , i 'm quite certain no one is suggesting anything so barbaric . 
  we simply need proper border controls to stop fake refugees and well-funded intelligence services to root out the lone wolves .
