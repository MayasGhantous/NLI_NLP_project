  and i was n't even talking about ww2-era . 
  i was talking after the wars . 
  that 's semantics . 
  if the fighting starts full scale on crimea , russians do n't care if it was started by ukrainians of russians themselves . 
  the only thing that matters that the fighting has started and russians have their excuse to escalate the conflict . 
  appeasement has it 's place in the world . 
  it 's not inherently a bad thing . 
  trying to avoid a worse fate by giving up something might be a good option . 
  whether that will work or not , no one can say in advance . 
  we know that it did n't work with hitler . 
  but for finland it worked . 
  i just fear that by not standing down , ukrainians give the russians an excuse to roll into ukraine and occupy it completely . 
  i think they should try to survive from this with as little damage as possible by giving crimea up and making sure that this wo n't happen to any other parts of ukraine . 
   your ** defeatist ** / appeasement attitude i would n't mind this word , if there actually was a way for ukraine to not lose crimea . 
  but i think there 's a slim chance of that . 
  you ca n't be serious with that comment . 
  no one is that foolish . 
   youd *** happily *** allow 42 % of your ethnic countrymen forcibly become part of russia ? 
  hell no . 
  i would n't be happy at all . 
  i would be furious . 
  i would want to drive them out of finland . 
  but sometimes wanting something is n't enough . 
  and sometimes doing something about it only makes things worse . 
  sometime you also have to come to terms with the situation , no matter how much it sucks . 
   i suppose you think the annexation of the sudetenland was a great idea too ? 
  you expect me to dignify this with an answer ? 
  you should feel bad for using this kind of arguments . 
  that 's a risky media play , since by doing this they risk on further escalating things . 
  but maybe by showing ( even for a short moment ) how ready they are to defend their are , they will cool russian ambitions . 
  it 's risky either way i 'd say . 
  `` the beginning of all wisdom is acknowledgement of facts . '', 
  - [ j.k. paasikivi , 7th president of finland ( president in 1946-56 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juho_kusti_paasikivi ) e : and name calling got ta be the shitties way of debating things . 
  no arguments or anything , just `` ur wrong faggot haha '' . 
  if they occupied in a middle of a governmental turmoil , and it was mostly inhabited by russians , i think i would advocate other options than open warfare against russia , which could possibly result in a complete occupation of finland . 
  so , yes . 
  now when you made the comparison , i 'm actually even more firmly thinking that they should stand down . 
  we finns have a history of coming to terms with the facts . 
  a doomed attempt to try to reclaim the area would result in needles loss of life at best , and in full military occupation of all of ukraine at worst . 
  i wish they 'd just stand down . 
  crimea is already lost , no sense dying because of it anymore . 
  and with fighting comes the risk of things escalating . 
  though estonians do n't like it ( for a good reason ) , we finns think of estonia as our little brother . 
  we would be really bummed out if anything happened to them . 
  but we are also way too scared of russia to actually do anything other than be mad . 
  i think he was talking about the level of freedom . 
  estonia and finland being together is a beautiful dream , but not likely to happen anytime soon . 
  i would love to see some personal union between finland and estonia though . 
  with one head of state ruling ( in name at least ) both states , and tallinn-helsinki being the twin capital of finland-estonia . 
  that would be really cool . 
  and we call you guys viro . 
  `` greater-finland , all the way to the ural ! '', 
  is actually a finnish joke . 
  this time , with * even more * bickering between denmark and sweden !, 
  these `` average people 's political parties '' turn into regular old parties real fast in my experience . 
   how is walking close to the bum , or talking to his neighbours , hurting him ? 
  it 's not , you are mixing two examples . 
   it would be even more damaging for the relations of that nato member and the rest of nato . 
  i agree . 
   nato also cooperated militarily with russia . 
  should china feel threatened and occupy vladivostok ? 
  never said anyone should invade anyone . 
  i never said what actions anyone should make . 
   why do you consider russia 's opinion to be the final arbiter on the situation ? 
  i do n't . 
  do n't create straw men . 
  i said that russia sees the action as aggressive behaviour , and i can see why . 
  from nato 's pov , it is n't aggressive , from russia 's it is . 
   you keep trying to paint nato as an offensive alliance while there are several clear examples that nato membership does not obligate its members to joint attacks . 
  i do n't think i am trying to paint it as an offensive alliance . 
  i 'm trying to say that it is n't solely a defensive alliance . 
   if you insist that everything is a postmodern mess totally dependent on personal whim and opinion , why do you want to discuss it at all ? 
  if opinions always trump any argument , why bother to bring arguments ? 
  i thought it was quite clear that i * do n't * want to argue this with you . 
  you are making wild assumptions and repeating the same questions that i 've already answered . 
  it 's almost like you are trying to wear me down on purpose . 
  but i do n't want to abandon a discussion , especially when the other party clearly does n't see my pov in any way . 
  and everything is not black and white . 
  or in this case , nato 's black is russias white . 
  as a side note , it 's actually `` tax * haven * '' , not heaven . 
  not trying to be mean here , it 's just that i wrote it as `` tax heaven '' for so long without anyone correcting it and i wish someone had done it earlier . 
   what do you call sending soldiers over and occupying a piece of territory then ? 
  how many times do i have to say this : my comment , which you replied to , dealt with finland joining nato and how russia would view it . 
   who hurt the bum ? 
  in that example , `` you '' . 
   if ukraine and friends wanted to gang up on russia they could do so at any time , with or without nato . 
  nato does not obligate assistance in aggressive wars , only in defensive wars . 
  the only obligation created by joining nato against russia is a defensive one , activated when russia would attack a nato member . 
  but you do agree that a nato member attacking russia and being subsequently invaded by russia would be a strain on nato ( us ) - russia relations ? 
  ( though this has little to do with the subject of my original comment . ), 
   nato members have no obligations when a nato member initiates an attack . 
   a defensive alliance is by definition not an aggressive more . 
  an offensive alliance would , but nato is n't an offensive alliance , there have been sufficient examples of wars recently where some nato members partook and some did not . 
  like i said , i think there is a difference between saying `` military alliance '' and `` defensive alliance '' . 
  saying it 's an `` defensive alliance '' sounds like you 're trying to exclude the other nature of nato , which is military co-operation . 
   yes , you are , because you 're trying to paint joining a defensive alliance as an aggressive action . 
  for the tenth time : russians clearly see it as one . 
  and i agree to that . 
  going from neutral nation to a member of military alliance that is the rival of russia seems damn much like one . 
  but the nature of it is n't so much a concern here .
