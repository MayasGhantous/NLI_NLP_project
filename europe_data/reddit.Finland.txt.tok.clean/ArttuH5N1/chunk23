  slowly but surely . 
  have you heard of the term ... salami tactics ? 
  hehehe, 
  `` only the name changed '' , apparently . 
  i feel like this is a bit much , even for this sub . 
  i 've never seen ussr breaking up being shrugged of this boldly . 
  i think they 're under the parliament . 
  no , wait ... 
  the whole english thing is just another strike . 
  what do we want ? 
  i before e !, 
  when do we want it ? 
  except after c !, 
  so he was the pao of his time . 
  when germany peaks , we will all feel it . 
  germany will peak all over us . 
  five ? 
  i do n't understand how they get anything done when all they do is trading kisses . 
  and a little penis touching , but that 's all . 
  but because english meters were three-dimensional , we get the myth that napolean was strangling less snakes than the average frenchman at the time and place . 
  haha , fair enough . 
  the usa patriot act is such a propaganda name . 
  it 's so over-the-top that it is n't even funny . 
  i find it interesting that americans are mostly concerned about tpp . 
  by going through their mps ' / members ' social media accounts . 
  how * dare * you . 
  saxony is `` saksi '' . 
  `` saksi '' also means '' ( a ) scissor '' ( not `` scissors '' , but '' * ( a ) scissor * '' ) . 
   those half blooded children hahaha , oh my god . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  if you use pushbullet , you can follow [ this channel ] ( https://www.pushbullet.com/channel?tag=onthehouse ) to get a notification whenever origin has a free `` on the house '' game . 
  it 's pretty neat . 
  well look at that . 
  that 's pretty neat !, 
  how * dare * you !?!, 
  but yeah , all nordic countries are like siblings . 
  and even though siblings fight and squabble amongst themselves , they still love each other . 
  we might joke a lot about how terrible sweden is and so on , but really , we secretly love them . 
  between blaming immigrants and computer games , i think blaming computer games is the smaller evil here . 
  though misdirected hate still does nothing to prevent these things , which is unfortunate . 
  arrest this extremist !, 
  i knew it . 
  [ it 's eu standardized english . 
  ] ( http://englishlanguage.pen.io/ ) damn i love reading that . 
  i have it bookmarked so i can read it from time to time . 
  always makes me laugh . 
   hurr , durr i 'm on a killing spree . 
  i have n't laughed this much when reading comments about a deadly shooting in a long time . 
  did my comment leave it open for interpretation ? 
  yes , i do think you might get shadowbanned for saying straight up racist/xenophobic shit . 
  oh man , these are great . 
  i 'll have to link to these every time i write the date in the iso approved , superior format of yyyy-mm-dd . 
  nice of you to offer , but i prefer [ coffee ] ( http://www.iso.org/iso/home/search.htm?qt=coffee&amp;sort=rel&amp;type=simple&amp;published=on ) . 
  interestingly , [ iso has no standards for porn ] ( http://www.iso.org/iso/home/search.htm?qt=porn&amp;sort=rel&amp;type=simple&amp;published=on ) . 
  what a letdown . 
  well in a private message to me , he did say this :  i did n't link that site directly because it seemed dodgy / far-right to me and i am against far-right extremism . 
  and ...  that being said , i hope they rape you next time so you can feel your country 's failed immigration policy first hand . 
  i 'm sure that 's all that girl was thinking all through her horrendous rape ... `` it 's ok , they 're not all like this , it 's fine i do n't want to be a racist . '', 
  so at lest he is n't a far-right extremist . 
  or does n't regard himself as one . 
  ( he 's referencing a rape that happened in finland some time ago . 
  the quote he used in an earlier message to me was from a far-right website . ), 
  i feel like you might get shadowbanned again if you continue to say the shit you said before . 
  that 's about it . 
  germany is actually just part of bavaria , but for some reason they call the whole thing `` germany '' . 
  hey , you ca n't just switch those around !, 
  stick with either english or pseudo-french for the italics part . 
  at least this is a great opportunity to tag xenophobes . 
  complaining is actually helpful in many cases . 
  by complaining about the quality of the comments you might make people think twice before posting crappy comments . 
  or not . 
  right after zuma 's revenge was offered on origin for free . 
  case closed . 
  `` e : wtf , ca n't a man be straight up racist anymore ? '', 
  good . 
  these are n't a weekly occurrence yet , though . 
  well , you 'd also think americans are used to shootings by now . 
  finland will once more be reunited with ... oh god no , retreat !, 
  retreat !, 
  i 'd say most people over at / r/linguistics are n't really linguists . 
  this is such a dumb comment in here . 
  i love it . 
  that counts as an admittance of guilt !, 
  time to get my hakkapeliitta outfit out of the closet . 
  now might be a good time to go shopping for some . 
  exactly what i thought . 
  that ca n't be a coincidence . 
  true , it 's probably the friends of key government members that make a hefty load of bread for themselves . 
  though i have to say , i 'd probably go watch a gladiator match . 
  i 'm not certainly above that . 
  i would just constantly chant maximus , maximus , maximus !, 
  other than to the builders , that is . 
  we need lawyers specialized in poe 's law to decipher this shit . 
  though i read it as sarcasm , seeing how much there 's so much emphasis on everything . 
  who would even eat some government bread , full of chemtrails . 
  that 's a great analogy on how this billboard stuff is just bullshit to keep the people content without actually doing anything . 
  ( i 'm talking about the ones officially targeted towards immigrants . ), 
  i wonder when they 'll literally provide bread and circuses . 
  actually , that would be way better than some hostile boards . 
  how are the wars on poverty and drugs going ?
