  italy and ( especially ) greece got overwhelmed while everyone else was just sitting idly by . 
  then when the people started to pour over to other countries , * that 's * when finally the talk about doing something together got some steam . 
  but even then country one by one started doing measures to stop the flow . 
  and that has been a * very * slow process , italy and greece are still overburdened and so on . 
  when something is bigger than one country that 's exactly when the eu should come in and help . 
  but we failed to do that and now we get to pay the price . 
  hopefully next time the countries in the eu see further than their own borders . 
  `` they 're not my problem '' does n't really work when it affects everyone . 
  i doubt throwing greece and italy under the buss would 've worked either . 
  they would 've just let people come through and everyone would 've just tried to fend for themselves . 
  sometimes unified front is way better than everyone just being selfish and making things worse . 
  does n't really help . 
  you need to process them case by case , if you want to follow the laws , treaties and principles i 've mentioned . 
  some things make it quicker , like an agreement that a certain country or area is not dangerous , which enables us to send the applicants from there back . 
  but that still requires us to process them . 
  there 's honestly no solution that 's quick , cheap and easy that does n't also require us to break those treaties and principles . 
  and breaking them would have its own repercussions . 
  there 's no easy way out for us , not anymore . 
  well i assumed we were working in accordance to existing eu laws , universal declaration of human rights , unhcr 's 1951 refugee convention and so on . 
  if we disregard laws and treaties , not to mention eu 's own principles , we could do it a lot cheaper . 
  you 're all just hungry for our sweet sweet timber !, 
  sure , people have thought about that . 
  but where to ? 
  and what is the timeline we 're talking about ? 
  we do n't have existing laws and agreements for that ( afaik ) , and negotiating such things takes up time . 
  time we do n't really have anymore . 
  the relocation plan is an emergency measure , meant to quickly ease the burden on greece and italy and even that is progressing very slowly . 
  imagine how slowly outside relocation would move . 
  relocation to countries outside of the eu will probably move in tandem with the emergency measure , but ca n't replace it altogether . 
  oh , we 're way past point where we could just tell greece to set up camps and hope them to succeed in that . 
  if we had helped greece before with setting up camps and guarding the border ( in addition to working more heavily with turkey early on and so on ) , we would be in a much better position . 
  but we 're past that , unfortunately . 
  not true . 
  unhcr provides ample material on the subject [ ( detention guideline ) ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/505b10ee9.pdf ) . 
   [ ... ] detention of asylum-seekers should normally be avoided and be a measure of last resort . 
  as seeking asylum is not an unlawful act , any restrictions on liberty imposed on persons exercising this right need to be provided for in law , carefully circumscribed and subject to prompt review . 
  detention can only be applied where it pursues a legitimate purpose and has been determined to be both necessary and proportionate in each individual case . 
  respecting the right to seek asylum entails instituting open and humane reception arrangements for asylum-seekers , including safe , dignified and human rights-compatible treatment . 
  and it goes on and on . 
  but the gist of it is that you * are * allowed to detain asylum seekers , as long as it 's in accordance of with and authorised by law , is n't arbitrary , discriminatory and so on . 
  ( the guideline is quite extensive . ), 
  i do n't think there 's much else to do in accordance to the 1951 refugee convention ( unhcr ) and eu 's own laws . 
  is there an alternative that * would n't * fuel eu skeptics ? 
  if the eu had acted decisively and in unified front when this issue was n't as big and mostly limited to greece and italy , we would probably be in a much better position . 
  but no one wanted to do that then ( least the eu skeptics ) and now something drastic like this has to be done . 
  it was a shitty situation in any case and now that we let it progress this far , we have to make shitty decisions . 
   based on feelings rather logic what are you basing this on ? 
   no country is benefitting from all of these immigrants , so why do they keep pushing them down eu 's throat ? 
  well turkey used them as leverage . 
  and the signatories of the 1951 refugee convention are bound by that . 
  so , the one doing the pushing would be the un and even eu 's own laws have much to say about this . 
  better and more committed frontex cooperation could 've probably lessened the problem we 're now facing . 
  but nah , everyone is unwilling to do anything until it directly and in a major way affects them . 
  greece ( and italy ) we 're both pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing . 
  i * really * doubt it . 
  i do n't think there 's any framework for punishing countries that want to leave and do it `` in accordance with its own constitutional requirements '' ( from the `` secession clause '' , treaty of lisbon ) . 
  the relocation scheme does take into account gdp , population size and such things , so it 's not nearly as bad might seem at first . 
  though if the wish is to have zero , of course it 's worse than that . 
  treaty of lisbon provides a secession clause , so if it 's what you want , you 're free to seek a referendum . 
  probably , even though uk has n't got anything to do with this . 
  uk , ireland and denmark will have to specifically opt-in to be included in the relocation scheme . 
  in the event of one or more member states being confronted by an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries , *** the council , on a proposal from the commission *** , may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the member state ( s ) concerned . 
  *** it shall act after consulting the european parliament . 
  *** so , at least it has went through multiple hoops before being forced on anyone . 
  ( and still the legitimacy is being questioned in eu court . ), 
  well greece is absolutely being crushed under the weight of the problem , especially given their `` preexisting condition '' , so relocating the refugees according to the `` distribution key '' seems like the best way to go . 
  i hope something could 've been done sooner and more decisively , but that did n't happen so here we are . 
  and once you look into the how they 're planning to distribute the asylum seekers , it does n't look * that * bad . 
  they 're taking into account many of the factors that are required to process the applicants swiftly and in a proper manner , as to not overburden countries . 
  it 's not the optimal way to handle the migrant crisis , but it 's probably the best way at this point . 
  i agree , though as a side note :  that 's the whole problem in a nutshell . 
  according to the un refugee convention the first country where refugees arrive has to process the asylum requests . 
  i did n't actually find this in the 1951 refugee convention ( at least with quick searching ) . 
  i know it 's present in the [ dublin ii regulation ( html , english ) ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=uriserv:l33153&amp;from=en ) , with the wording :  illegal entry or stay in a member state  where the asylum seeker has irregularly crossed the border into a member state , that member state will be responsible for examining the asylum application . 
  though it continues :  [ ... ] this responsibility ceases 12 months after the date on which the border has been illegally crossed . 
   when the asylum seeker has been living for a continuous period of at least five months in a member state before lodging his/her asylum application , that member state becomes responsible for examining the application . 
  where the applicant has been living for a period of time of at least five months in several member states , the member state where he/she lived most recently shall be responsible for examining the application . 
  which , in light of recent happenings , can be seen as pretty problematic . 
  no wonder the more `` desirable '' countries are looking to tighten their application process . 
  if you 're wondering what the legal basis for the relocation is : [ european schemes for relocation and resettlement ( pdf ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/communication_on_the_european_agenda_on_migration_annex_en.pdf ) :  on the basis of a distribution key , the commission will , by the end of may , propose triggering the emergency response system envisaged under articl e 78 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union and introduce a temporary european relocation scheme for asylum seekers who are in clear need of international protection . 
  article 78 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( [ link to tfeu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:12012e/txt&amp;from=en ) ) :  78 ( 3 . ), 
  in the event of one or more member states being confronted by an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries , the council , on a proposal from the commission , may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the member state ( s ) concerned . 
  it shall act after consulting the european parliament . 
  the legal basis of that has been questioned by two members ( afaik ) , so it will probably be debated , but this has been used for the justification for the plan . 
   right to decide on how a country distributes its welfare ? 
  i 'm sure the eu has some say in the treatment of asylum seekers , but is n't this mostly handled by the eu ? 
  *** edit : *** the 1951 refugee convention , united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) , chapter v : public relief and social security , part 1 : public relief and health care , 1 . international standard :  the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals  1951 convention , article 23 , public relief [ pdf ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocpdfviewer.html?docid=3cf33fbc4&amp;query=refugee%20benefits ), 
  the current system is kinda giving the finger to the border countries . 
  shared weight would better ensure that no one country does n't have to take all the others pressure and ensures that everyone is committed to doing something about this mess . 
  the current system of `` you take care of it ! '', 
  is fucking terrible and something needs to be done . 
  i somehow feel like that 's more likely to happen with nato than common eu military . 
  nato would have less to lose with that one and could start playing the long game , while eu would be pretty fucked if it just gave up half the continent . 
  a lot of people are worse than ignorant when it comes to how the eu works . 
  well it would hurt them more than us , so maybe the eu just stopped giving a shit ? 
  that would be pretty hilarious , actually . 
  `` we 're leaving and we really mean it ! '', 
  well everything the eu does that i do n't agree with is undemocratic , of course . 
   i do n't recognise any eu legitimacy on the issue well okay ? 
  i mean , i must be reading this wrong .
