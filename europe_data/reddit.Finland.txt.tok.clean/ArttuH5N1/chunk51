  it was a poor victory for the soviets in the sense that they did n't conquer us , but it still clearly was a victory . 
  and for us , we were n't defeated as quickly as everyone thought , but we were defeated still . 
  the situation in the end is n't really up for debate , imo . 
  the finnish army near breaking , our politicians and military leaders desperate to negotiate a peace treaty and so on . 
  does n't mean we were friends . 
  there certainly were people friendly towards germany , but there was also some dislike towards them from the higher ups . 
  unless you mean `` friends '' in the sense of `` someone with a common goal '' , then sure . 
  we were nazi-germany 's friends in continuation war . 
  still , they were rat bastards in winter war , selling us out and then trying to prevent italy from helping us . 
  that would still be the soviets . 
  the nazis were the ones that sold us to soviet union . 
  they were n't our friends . 
  i hope people would stop saying it was a victory for us . 
  it was n't . 
  though i ca n't blame them , we use the term `` torjuntavoitto '' ( `` defensive victory ) ourself . 
  i guess it 's hard to admit that it was an outright defeat . 
  we did n't break as easily as the soviet wishes and everyone thought we would , but break we did . 
   the `` cultural marxism '' ( refugees ) hahahahaha, 
   janitors generally testify in favor of the former . 
  well now i wish there was some proof for * that * . 
  i got that from fondling cocks . 
  honestly , i just ca n't be bothered to use soap when i take a piss . 
  i wonder if anyone has studied this . 
  it 's generally thought women 's bathrooms are cleaner ( and that 's also my experience ) but there 's a group of people who claim it 's actually the opposite . 
  baby wipes ? 
  not just toilet paper ? 
  it 's certainly a bit confusing way of using `` then '' but if it 's how people use it , fine . 
  to me it seems like he thought it was something other than bullshit first because of that `` then '' ( or `` than '' , but i suspect that 's just a typo ) but given what he said and what you said , that does n't seem to be the case . 
  if it 's then bullshit , what was it before ? 
  even if he did n't try to defend it , the wording does imply so . 
  if it was bullshit to begin with , saying `` then it 'd be bullshit '' does n't really make sense . 
  but fair enough , he said he is n't trying to defend it . 
  i 'm just saying the wording does n't reflect what he said . 
   than [ sic ] it 'd be complete bullshit . 
  `` then it 'd be '' implies that it is n't now . 
  my silence can be bought with a meagre sum of douze points . 
  well it 's interesting to see europeans bashing each other instead of immigrants . 
  it 's like coming home from a long trip . 
  clearly you 're forgetting the person announcing the eurovision points . 
  there 's so much salt and vinegar around that you 'd think the brits were cooking . 
  it 's belgium , not england and germany . 
  i 'm on mobile so trying to find good sources and whatnot is a hassle , but you should see the other replies i got . 
  there 's one with a great looking link that talks exactly about this topic . 
  it 's the arabic name/translation/version for `` isil '' and used to prevent is 's claim to legitimacy . 
  daesh sounding like something derogatory in arabic seems to be a myth or at least being based on very little actual proof . 
  ( according to articles i 've read . 
  at least many linguists seem to think it 's just an urban legend or something of that nature and influenced by `` orientalism '' . ), 
  thanks , even wikipedia has some of these dubious theories in their article . 
  it 's not the best time to be into ancient egyptian religion either . 
  makes sense . 
  though i think news outlets should use the name the group calls themselves/an internationally recognized name for them ( see : myanmar ) . 
  politicians are free to use whatever name they wish , since politics is all they 're about , but i hope news outlets would stick to `` neutral '' ( in the political/journalistic sense ) names . 
  ( that 's why i do n't like bbc using `` burma '' , for example . ), 
  and do n't get me wrong , i think isis/daesh/whatever is an abomination and i would n't mind if they were all slaughtered like animals they are . 
  and i certainly do n't think they 're a ( legitimate ) state of any sort . 
  it 's more about the journalistic principle behind the use of names . 
  a lot of people are switching over to `` daesh '' , because apparently is does n't really like it . 
  ( which is weird , since is n't it just `` isis '' in arabic ? ), 
  even some news agencies are using `` daesh '' as a sort of protest i guess , which is kinda weird . 
  then again , bbc loves to call myanmar `` burma '' , so it 's not unheard-of to be a bit picky about the name , even for news agencies . 
  e : `` isil '' is what wikipedia calls it , `` is '' is what they want to be called as and `` isis '' is the old most people still use . 
  and daesh is the arabic equivalent of ** isil ** , not isis , that people use to question their legitimacy as a `` state '' . 
   the group is known in arabic as ad-dawlah al-isl\u0101miyah f\u012b ` l-\u02bfir\u0101q wa-sh-sh\u0101m , leading to the acronym da'ish or daesh ( \u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634 , arabic pronunciation : [ \u02c8da\u02d0\u0295i\u0283 ] ) , [ 36 ] [ 37 ] the arabic equivalent of `` isil '', 
  kinda dumb to ask for solidarity ( which at least the french president did ) and then try to shift the blame on a fellow eu member state . 
  of course `` france '' does n't have a single voice and a single opinion and saying anything to that effect is dumb on my part , but i ca n't help feeling a bit salty about this . 
  he refuses to change , no matter how hard you dirty jihadists try !, 
  no guns or mass shootings , how disappointing . 
  i like how the latter one and the irish one above this comment are made from the same picture . 
  well it was a common style of cheap and quick to build housing . 
  we have them in finland too . 
  i 'd say most countries have some form of those hideous blocks . 
  tight shirt . 
  leave it to americans to be unaware of different cultures , 
  it 's nowhere near sane . 
  they should be instantly exiled . 
  let 's spare the foreigners from this particular circlejerk . 
  this was banned from / r/suomi for a reason , no need to bring it over here . 
  hah , kirkkonummi is in the nice position where everyone looks down on us . 
  instead of countries announcing their points , it will be imf announcing up and down gdp points . 
  it would be quite funny to turn depressing situation into an extravagant show . 
  i suspect they 'll be labeling someone the `` sick man of europe '' every other year . 
  i read they sell valio cheeses in nyc delis . 
  sounds strange . 
  damn i envy you guys . 
  does n't really look like they deserve the shit they get . 
  i have n't noticed anyone piling on the czech people over this . 
  i 'm really surprised about south korea though . 
  i imagined it as a very productive country . 
  then again , i guess they work hellish hours to offset the industrial output and overall gdp . 
  not everyone lives in the greater helsinki area . 
  you fuckers need to use more toilet paper , help us out here come on, 
  i meant the last part as further conversation on * why * the us could 've done more bad shit than germany , not an accusation towards you . 
  though your first comment to me did seem like you were arguing that germany has done more bad shit than the us and not an argument that neither side is `` white '' . 
  because no one was arguing that , just like you were n't trying to justify the bad shit germany and the us have done . 
   i 'm just saying they are n't angels , no one is . 
  and no one argued differently . 
  as my comment said , things are n't black and white . 
  but things being `` gray '' does n't mean everyone is equally gray . 
  you can say that if ( east ) germany was more influential , they could 've done more shit than the us has done . 
  but the influence and presence of the us around the world is an explanation , not a justification .
