  i 'm sorry , i 'm not following your logic here . 
  does morocco have parts in europe ? 
  the same historical argument can be made for it as you 'd use for turkey i guess , but turkey still has parts in europe , whereas morocco does n't ( afaik ) . 
  but yeah , that turkey debate is a real can of worms and a bit of a sidestep from the topic at hand , which is russia . 
   i live in `` the center of the eu '' . 
  guess where i currently live ? 
  i 'd guess germany based on that alone . 
  it 's always been the country i think of when i think of central europe . 
  that or czech republic . 
   center is an abstract concept just like europe . 
  not really . 
  you could calculate the central point of the eu , given that we have set boundaries for it . 
  it 's not abstract like the european borders at all . 
  there 's a huge amount of legal stuff , all kinds of agreements and border treaties to define what 's in eu and what is not . 
  i get your point , but it 's a bit of a bad example if you ask me . 
   everycountry has a different view of it . 
  not really . 
  there are the generally agreed upon borders and some cases which deviate from those . 
  but in majority of cases , that border is in ural mountains in the east . 
   russia is clearly not part of europe . 
  neither historically , geographicaly or politicaly . 
  yeah , there 's nothing `` clear '' about that , haha . 
  did you actually take a look at the picture i took ? 
  of maps of europe , almost everyone featuring russia ? 
  you can make that search yourself too , i just searched `` europe '' , `` european continent '' might be pretty good too . 
  you could also check the wikipedia article and their sources for further proof , if not of anything else than about it absolutely not being clear that russia is n't european . 
  in fact , there 's a pretty strong case for the opposite , since in majority of cases it is indeed considered part of europe . 
  and russia has been a major part of european history . 
  it 's kinda hard to ignore their effect on shaping that history . 
  as for politically being part of europe , i ca n't say much about that since it 's such a vague statement . 
  i guess it depends on what you mean by tgat . 
  but russia is and has been a major political player in europe for a long , long time . 
   edit : just in case you think * `` then what about finland ? 
  '' * in france , you get told about the viking invasion and how they where a major component of france/europe history . 
  you guys were already in the game 1.3 k years ago . 
  it was more the danes , norse and swedes that were the vikings . 
  we were more their victims than anything . 
  that is , if we were considered at all . 
  nothing much was happening here during the viking age . 
  the eastern border of europe is arbitrary , but it 's generally accepted to be at the ural mountains . 
   europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of eurasia . 
  europe is bordered by the arctic ocean to the north , the atlantic ocean to the west , and the mediterranean sea to the south . 
  *** to the east and southeast , europe is generally considered as separated from asia by the watershed divides of the ural and caucasus mountains , the ural river , the caspian and black seas , and the waterways of the turkish straits . 
  *** ( wikipedia ) this is the result of google image search on the subject : http://i.imgur.com/uwuwnlp.png i 'd say it 's pretty fair to say that the eastern border is *** generally agreed upon *** to be at ural mountains , it 's rather an exception than the rule to have it elsewhere . 
  and i 'm talking about cases where people disparage russia in other ways . 
  it 's not just that some people casually mention russia being asian , it 's comments where people show their distaste of it and then make a point about how it 's not european but instead asian . 
  i do n't know man , when they use `` scum '' in the same sentence , i kinda feel like it 's an insult . 
  but maybe i 'm just projecting . 
  and if it 's actually not clear , i 'm not talking about the title here , though i think i mentioned that in my earlier comment . 
  yeah , it 's kinda telling of their own mindset when they 're using it as an insult . 
  some people actually think that . 
  in some cases it 's genuine ignorance of where the ( generally agreed upon ) borders of europe are , but sometimes it 's actually used to somehow disparage russia . 
  or trying to imply that there 's a bigger difference between russia and other european countries than there actually is . 
  it 's pretty silly . 
  i guess they just dismiss the generally accepted borders in favour of some `` kool kidz club '' borders which they want to draw based on what countries they like and which they do n't . 
  it would make very little sense otherwise . 
  sorry about the rant , it 's just something that bothers me . 
  but yeah , in this case it 's about space agencies , which are separate . 
  though the wording on the title is pretty awkward . 
   if you would read the article  i am inclined to agree *** but probably for entirely different reasons than erdogan *** that 's why i asked , i was curious about those `` entirely different reasons '' . 
  what are your reasons for believing that the un has become a burden on the humankind ? 
  the one with the cross is slovakia , because a cross has some ( far fetched ) resemblance to a k. so , slovakia . 
  the other one is slovenia . 
  it 's not fair if you do it for a living, 
  i 'm not sure who `` you guys '' is here , but i 'm personally kinda tired of seeing incredibly hateful shit being flung at muslims on a regular basis , so seeing a brit , and an ukip supporter at that , complaining about `` not feeling welcome '' here irks me a lot . 
  `` this is n't even my final proposal . '', 
  imagine how it will be if trump gets elected . 
  even faceless eu bureaucrats have feelings . 
  i have no face and i must cry . 
  yeah . 
  i ca n't even imagine what it feels like to be muslim/immigrant and browsing this sub . 
  but no , poor brits get snarky comments , that 's the * real * issue here . 
  i can only imagine what it feels like to be muslim and browsing this sub ... 
  i thought they do n't do that anymore . 
  do n't you dare judge me, 
  there 's one now above ( and below ) your comment . 
  seems like i 'm increasingly missing out on the in-sub jokes . 
  then again , i 'm also missing out on most of the drama , so it 's a pretty fair trade-off . 
  well that 's certainly a nice change from all the hate and bickering . 
  i ca n't see it lasting more than a few days . 
  the guy legalized vigilante murders . 
  i do n't really give a shit about what kind of swear words he uses when addressing other countries , that kinda trumps everything else . 
  it 's a fucked up country you live in . 
  hope you 're safe . 
  just sprinkle some heroin on him and it 's all nice and legal . 
   am i the only one loving magrethe vestager absolutely not . 
  there 's been a lot of cheer for her efforts . 
  you 're definitely not alone in this . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong ( and i very well might be ) but these things are n't retroactively enforced since the it has been a rule for a long time not to give unfair advantage to any single company . 
  which is what most of these huge corporations are using to get away with paying close to no taxes . 
  some countries are making deals with certain companies to have * their * tax rate be lower than those of other companies . 
  this is what you can achieve on four glasses of champagne per interview . 
  it would be hilarious to see workers digging up the asphalt in front of some company hq . 
  and here i thought we were special . 
  turns out we 're just like the rest . 
  / r/europe, 
  explains why i have to sometimes adjust calendars so that they do n't start on sunday . 
  the immigrants are stealing our women !, 
  it will be interesting to see how many babies they 'll make . 
  says the man too lazy to proofread his comments .
