  eh , language codes could be as well known ( i 'm actually not sure about that ) , but i think it would just make the map less informative on a quick glance . 
  the colours of the flags definitely help in that . 
  and it 's not like using the flags is a huge problem in any case . 
  it will cause a few arguments , but it 's also a common convention to just use certain flags to indicate language . 
  maybe if there was universally recognized symbols , that would work as an alternative , but now , i 'd just leave it as it is . 
  could be more useful in the future if chinese business influence keeps spreading at the pace it is currently spreading . 
  and besides , a lot of scifi works ( after japan did n't become the world eating behemoth we thought in the 80 's ) depict chinese as one of the major international ( and interplanetary ) languages . 
  firefly has n't lied to me so far !, 
  so far ... :'(, 
  i do n't think there are any universally recognized symbols for different languages . 
  you could of course indicate them with colours or just write them in , but that 's would make finding information at a glance unnecessarily harder . 
  damn brits , they ruined english for us, 
  having everyone speak basically the same language ( of course there would be regional difference and it could fracture completely at some point ) would be pretty handy . 
  i wonder how many misunderstandings and problems we could avoid with that . 
  reminds me a lot of [ this picture .

  guys , when it comes to immigrant memes , you 're both getting rammed . 
  mom told us to play with our little brother, 
  i 'd be all for removing mandatory swedish and replacing it with a mandatory third language which you can choose yourself from a list of languages . 
  be it swedish , russian , german and so on . 
  chinese could also be an interesting choice , but i do n't know if we have enough teachers and interest to support that . 
   neither you * nor your government * what the hell does finland have to do with this ?!? 
  it 's not really the place for finnish government to provide proof towards any factor here . 
  what a bizarre statement . 
   saying you have proof and providing proof are two very different prospects . 
  what do you want proof of exactly ? 
  i 'm more than happy to provide evidence to back up what i 've said . 
  sources chronicling the coup attempt : bbc : [ turkey 's coup attempt : what you need to know ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36816045 ) * bridges over the bosphorus strait in istanbul were blocked by troops late evening local time on friday . 
  fighter jets and helicopters were seen flying over the turkish capital , ankara , and gunshots heard . 
  * * a faction of the army then said , via a state broadcaster , that it had seized power to protect democracy from president recep tayyip erdogan . 
  * * over the course of a violent night , tv stations were raided by soldiers , explosions heard in istanbul and ankara , protesters shot at , the parliament and presidential buildings fired upon , a military helicopter shot down and the turkish military chief taken hostage . 
  * reuters : [ timeline : turkey 's attempted coup ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-timeline-factbox-iduskcn0zv2um )  you keep repeating the same the same thing , as if need to to convince yourself that is enough no , i have to keep repeating it since you 're clearly not understanding . 
  we have all this information and evidence of coup attempt . 
  we know a faction in the military was involved in it . 
  this is what we know . 
  the question who orchestrated it remains open though . 
  people are claiming to know it was orchestrated by erdogan , which would definitely need some proof to be believable . 
  and yet *** you have n't provided any proof *** , towards * anything * . 
  you 've just accused me of being a shill and if that 's all you have , it 's not very believable . 
   i am not sure why you make the coup any more or less than it was  it is not as relevant as erdogan taking more power and control , your argument appears to be deflecting from the actual power grab by concentrating on the coup and its possible perpetrator , it is an historical event no longer anything more than an excuse for the dicktator to gain more power . 
  you should read my comments again . 
  i said this earlier :  it should be treated as what it is and there could be much more fruitful discussion about the reasons why it happened , why it failed , how turkish government will react to this , how will it affect the elections and so on . 
  i 'm all for leaving open the possibility of it being a conspiracy by the state , questioning the course of events and so on , but there 's nothing fruitful about refusing to accept the more likely option  i am not sure why you make the coup any more or less than it was , it has gone , it happened , it may have been real it may not , it is not as relevant as erdogan taking more power and control you seem to forget that i 'm not the one who insinuated that the coup was a false flag operation , so i suggest that you take your own advice in this matter . 
   no one ( outside of turkey ) cares whether the coup was real there 's plenty of interest in it . 
  most people agree that there was a coup attempt and that 's generally accepted , but there 's a lot of talk on reddit about how it was a false flag operation . 
  so , people definitely care . 
   actually i suggested that you write like an apco/academi shill , that your method of commenting and manipulation was exactly like apco/academi shills , and so from reading your past comments , particularly concerning turkey and the dicktator , i concluded that you are indeed a shill which is a pathetic argument to use . 
  you have n't provided any evidence or even implied of having any . 
  your only argument against what i 've said seems to be that i must be a shill , which is n't true at all . 
   you have not denied been a shill , or an apco/academi deskjockey , which is telling in its own way . 
  it 's not telling of anything . 
  if i say i 'm not a shill , you would still claim i was one and just denying it . 
  stop with this pathetic nonsense . 
  not everyone who disagrees with you has to be a shill . 
  i just ca n't stand conspiracy theories treated as the truth . 
  it 's very annoying to see people parrot things about false flag operation and provide zero proof when they 're called out on it and instead resort to calling people shills . 
   you have not denied been a shill , or an apco/academi deskjockey i have no idea what `` apco/academi deskjockey '' is and searching it just gives me results from times you 've called people that before in a sad attempt to undermine their comments , but i 'm definitely not a shill for anything . 
   again , the `` coup '' is not the real point of the conversation you brought it up yourself and it seems to be a pretty important part of your original comment . 
   erdogan been a dicktator and even if the coup was not a theatrical event organised by erdogans cabal , he has turned it into the erdogan coup and history will always place it at erdogans feet . 
  because of his actions and abuse of power and manipulation i have n't argued against that . 
  i was just asking for proof about the coup was a false flag operation since you insinuated it and keep doing it . 
  and as a reminder , you have n't provided any proof , despite urging me to do so . 
   my appologies if i offended you , people get offended so easily these days . 
  people acting as if conspiracy theories are true and not providing any evidence to support the said theory annoy me a lot . 
  it does n't offend me , but it 's really , really annoying to see . 
  same goes for people who accuse anyone they argue with of being a shill . 
  as i said , it 's a pathetic and childish way to argue . 
  you did n't provide any evidence even pointing towards the coup attempt actually being a false flag operation orchestrated by the government . 
  instead you just went ahead and accused me of being a shill ( although in a long and convoluted way ) . 
  not only is it an awful way of debating anything , but it also is n't going to convince anyone . 
  pretty much the opposite , it indicates that there probably is n't any evidence to provide . 
  and that 's pretty damning on the conspiracy theory . 
  we know there were soldiers in the streets , we know they tried to ( and did ) take over key targets and locations in istanbul , we have a statement given by the soldiers to the tv station to read , we know such attempts have been ( successfully ) made before and so on . 
  everything points at it being a coup attempt . 
  and it 's generally accepted it as one . 
  so it falls on those say otherwise to provide proof and convincing arguments for that not being the case . 
  i have seen neither proof or convincing arguments , just accusations of being a shill and/or a die-hard erdogan supporter . 
  not very convincing at all . 
  and we know that erdogan has been grabbing more power to himself . 
  we know he is becoming more dictatorial every day . 
  we know he 's pushing a religious agenda . 
  but that does n't mean that the coup was n't real , that 's the exact reason it happened in the first place . 
  the rebels tried to take over because of those reasons , not despite them . 
  so i really ca n't see how that 's a good argument for anything other than the coup being real . 
  you claim to be for `` open minded conversation '' , but instead you decided to call me a shill . 
  yeah , that 's not what an `` open minded conversation '' is about . 
  i 've said i 'm open to the possibility of it being a false flag operation but i would need actual proof to believe it . 
  you did n't provide that , just baseless accusations . 
  it would n't be the first time germans give chinese ideas about revolution . 
  ** official complaint about a theft ** please read the terms of this official complaint ( later referred as `` complaint '' ) carefully . 
  by submitting this complaint you agree to ... [ x ] i would like to install yahoo toolbar and apply for asylum [ back ] [ next ], 
  he would fit in really well in finland . 
  `` it 's kinda bothering me that they 've kept me here for a week , but i do n't want to make a fuss . '', 
  the language barrier would n't be a problem since speaking is n't actually a mandatory part of communication in here . 
  does n't explain the combative tone though . 
  at no point did i even imply that russia was the only one doing things like that . 
  that 's the opposite of the usual stereotype you see on reddit , haha, 
  oh damn , i hopped off the bus at the wrong stop . 
  guess i live here now . 
  of course similar things have been done by the west , but how does it relate to my comment ?
