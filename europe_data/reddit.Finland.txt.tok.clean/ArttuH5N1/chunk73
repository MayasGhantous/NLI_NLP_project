  seems pretty harmless ( at least in theory ) compared to how they 're often represented . 
  like , if they want to do decide things between them based on their customs , that 's fine for me , as long as they respect the existing laws . 
  waka waka eeh ehh , it 's time for sharia, 
  not to mention make it all spotted . 
  there 's also -40 which is the same in fahrenheit and celcius . 
  it does n't really have any good proof going for it . 
   prozes ei esitt\u00e4nyt v\u00e4itteelleen tarkempia todisteita when you follow the cited source the `` proof '' seems to vanish . 
  it 's basically just someone saying `` yeah , this is totally the deal here '' . 
   if the russian media claims , that some russians lives in a climate of fear in x. 
  would your respond still be ` biased source ! ', 
  surely russians are experts on the issue ? 
  the point being that their possible bias could be affecting their reporting and should be taken into account . 
  ideas going to comment how surely the ( upper ) limits of their airspace sovereignty come into effect here , but ...  there is no international agreement on the vertical extent of sovereign airspace ( the boundary between outer space -- which is not subject to national jurisdiction -- and national airspace ) , with suggestions ranging from about 30 km ( 19 mi ) ( the extent of the highest aircraft and balloons ) to about 160 km ( 99 mi ) ( the lowest extent of short-term stable orbits ) . 
  the f\u00e9d\u00e9ration a\u00e9ronautique internationale has established the k\u00e1rm\u00e1n line , at an altitude of 100 km ( 62 mi ) , as the boundary between the earth 's atmosphere and outer space , while the united states considers anyone who has flown above 50 miles ( 80 km ) to be an astronaut ;, 
  i doubt they 'd declare war on russia and send in troops , but they 'd probably give other kind of support like intel and equipment . 
  i 'd imagine same for nato , when it comes to fibland or sweden . 
  that 'd be awesome even if just for to see the reaction of some of the people on this sub . 
  a lot of people on reddit are considering rt a valid source and a decent news site , when their objective is the same as that of the loonier sites . 
  russia is pretty good at this game . 
  sweden is expensive overall . 
  not as expensive as norway , but quite expensive still . 
  happened upon that store just a few days ago . 
  it 's * way * larger than you 'd think before stepping in !, 
  i thought it would be a cute little boutique , but the there was section after section and then a whole another floor !, 
  almost lost my friends there , haha, 
  ironically ironic ? 
  yeah i do n't really know what you mean by that , that 's too many layers . 
  i 'm honestly annoyed by the `` virtue signalling '' term . 
  it 's almost as bad as `` fake news '' . 
  both are applied so liberally that there 's no sense to it . 
  it 's like when people accuse someone of `` virtue signalling '' . 
  like , so you see the virtue in what i 'm saying and it 's bad because ... ? 
  nazis are socialists , it 's right there in the name !, 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  that 'll teach them !, 
  significantly harder to have a kid that way though . 
  you do n't have to have a relationship to have sex , dummy, 
  please no , / r/mapporn is bad enough as it is, 
  are you serious ? 
  this is a joke, 
  you sure about that, 
  i 'd say it 's just reddit 's finnish community going apeshit and that it 's not representative of finns in general , but this time i feel like that 's not really true . 
  there 's people out there who actually feel this strongly about this stuff . 
  it 's not really `` mistake '' when there 's no set borders . 
  which makes it even weirder why some finns are getting so worked up over this . 
  must be something in \u00e4itiyspakkaus that they forgot to put in mine . 
  what 's triggering about this though ? 
  or am i missing a meme ? 
  are you guys looking away when raising your hand ? 
  if not , that 's your right hand silly . 
  that 's insulting mostly because how unfunny that joke is . 
  it 's like doing `` i 'm going to finnish this , haha '' thing . 
  downright insulting . 
   triggered fins will flock to your comment in hordes and insist that nazi germany and finland in no way fought together but just happen to fight the same enemy at the same time . 
  i know that point is sometimes made in history classes and whatnot , but i ca n't really see people on reddit trying to point it out very enthusiasticly . 
  looks terrible either way . 
  though i guess most of these are meant to be jokes and not actually good looking . 
  interestingly you replied to a wrong comment from me . 
  i 've never seen this before . 
  i was n't talking about my impression in particular , but how he 's generally viewed . 
  you could google `` trump anti-lgbtq '' and see how many complaints there are . 
  which shows that a lot of people see this administration as anti-lgbtq . 
  and that was what i originally said . 
  good that we 've finally circled back here . 
   he has not actually done anything negative for lgbtq some seem to consider statements like the ones from the president and vice president alone in being harmful , but it 's not something i 'd get into since i have n't read anything on the subject . 
   it factors into it because i was making a sarcastic comment with regard to your pathetic virtue signalling . 
  virtue signalling ? 
  what are you on about ? 
   they were saying the opposite of what you said , so no ? 
  you were n't calling out low-effort popular comments ? 
  i thought that was what you were trying to do so i assumed you 'd call out both of us . 
   the fuck does that have to do with anything ? 
  that i had serious doubts , even if you were seemingly calling out low-effort popular comments , that you 'd do it equally to comments from different viewpoints and were n't just `` calling out '' ones that you disagree with . 
  but since you 're calling out `` virtue signalling '' ( ? 
  ) , i guess it does n't have anything to do here . 
  though the term seems to be really popular among the folk that would frequent those subs , so it 's related , if not directly or the way i meant it . 
  how does bravery factor into any of this ? 
  also , you should see the comment i replied to . 
   dae drumpf stupid xd xd hope you congratulated them for their bravery also . 
   moderator of  r/womenfortrump  r/mittromney  r/thanksobongo somehow i doubt it . 
  i 've seen people call anti-trump comments `` edgy '' . 
  i think it 's used just to disparage the commenters , but it could also be because anti-trump stuff is stuff against an authority ( which would be `` edgy '' in a way ) but because it 's popular , it 's * mockingly * called `` edgy '' as in `` not really edgy but a weak attempt at being edgy '' . 
  it gets complicated and like i said , the word has been really overused . 
  and like you said , some people use it to refer to anything slightly provocative or offensive as `` edgy '' . 
  like the german carnival floats where trump was taking it in the ass or something , i do n't remember . 
  though i do think that 's somewhat edgy in the provocative/offensive sense . 
  whether it 's `` true edge '' ( lol ) or something like that , i have no idea , i 'm not sure what the word was supposed to mean originally . 
  so in your mind , do those comments make him seem less or more anti-lgbtq ? 
  you keep repeating that they have n't been banned but i did n't even say he was . 
  just that the act alone of tweeting that they should be banned makes him seem anti-lgbtq . 
   even if he personally is moderate on the issue , it should n't be surprising that his administration is *** viewed *** as anti-lgbtq . 
  i feel like we 're discussing different things . 
  do you mean that the administration is n't anti-lgbtq in their actions ? 
  because i 'm saying that the administration is *** viewed *** as anti-lgbtq because of the comments by the president and the vice president . 
   or am i misunderstanding what people mean by `` edgy '' ? 
  could be . 
  my whole point originally was that everything is labeled as `` edgy '' , it 's used as a general retort even when it does n't really fit . 
  from what i can tell , it 's still pretty popular on reddit . 
  i do n't know about other places or about ( stand-up ) comedy in particular , but as a general retort it sees a lot of use here . 
   `` [ p ] lease be advised that the united states government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the u.s. military , '' trump tweeted wednesday morning .
