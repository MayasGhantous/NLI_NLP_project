  it 's a reddit thing . 
  dutch people apparently have some rivalry with us , which is strange because our rivalry is with sweden . 
  could be , but that would n't give a proper outlook on `` each country 's subreddit '' since the ones in the sidebar are often just `` quarantine '' subs . 
  i think he made the same mistake for every other subreddit too that has an english language subreddit and a native one . 
  yeah , / r/finland is a quarantine subreddit , not the one natives use . 
  though i guess it works better than expected , seeing how the person who made this did n't know about it . 
  that 's still a thing ? 
  i thought it went out of fashion ages ago . 
   more of natsoc but hitler kinda ruined it hahaha , jesus christ, 
  i do n't think people realize melilla is in africa . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plazas_de_soberan%c3%ada interesting article on the areas spain has is africa, 
   in europe actually this happened in africa :\\ ^ ), 
  wait , did i miss some recent news about swedish police or something ? 
  are they seen as incompetent or something ? 
  when did this happen ? 
   are culturally and politically closer to spain that 's such a weird reason to care about stuff . 
  morocco is their goddamn neighbor , it would be insane not to care about what goes on in morocco just because there are countries culturally closer to spain than them . 
  the us has more people per capita , duh, 
  a huge chunk of europe is missing on that , i think that was the point . 
  even better haha , 20 goddamn percent , that 's mental, 
  aquaman is the sea horse of the super heroes, 
  and constantly interrupt your meal , from what i 've heard . 
  if i want to talk to the waiter instead of my friends , i 'll call him/her over . 
  surefire way to not get any tips , haha . 
  over here we do n't give tips for shit service . 
  take a look at his comment history , the answer should be fairly obvious . 
   the swords are planted into solid rock , so they may never be removed . 
  is that so ... 
  a cameo from the executive producer, 
  fucking christian democracy , i knew it, 
  i know racist use `` urban '' same way neo-nazis use `` globalist '' , but i do n't think it 's very widespread in europe to use it that way . 
   lots of boys arent able to retract the foreskin which could be bad . 
  that 's absolutely an acute medical reason . 
  it 's an ongoing medical issue that circumcision has solved . 
  my friend has had it done , actually and i do n't think anyone would be against circumcision in a case like that . 
   it does n't make your penis insensitive at all if it 's done medically and thus probably partially , that 's the misconception . 
  i think the issue is that i 'm mostly talking about full circumcision done for religious/cultural reasons . 
  i 've read that the head will get less sensitive in those cases , but honestly i 'm not any kind of authority in this and do n't know . 
   the reason i got so annoyed is that people talking about it have no clue what they 're talking about and are talking about it like it 's some disease and makes me feel like a freak while i never felt that way about it . 
  what a lot of people do n't get is that they 're talking about the most private things and probably personal . 
  so mind your wording and steps . 
  im not saying you ca n't argue about it but when you throw in sentiment about it in the discussion it can get hurtfull . 
  i agree and i 'm really sorry if i came of as attacking you or anyone that has had circumcision done . 
  i 'm not against circumcised people but rather the religious/cultural practise . 
  i hope you get what i mean . 
  and i absolutely get why this is such a senstive and private , but also very divisive and heated topic . 
   circumcision is also to prevent medical occurences regardless of having a problem . 
  yeah but the benefits are so miniscule that it 's kinda hard to use it as a justification , especially so since it does have a function in human body . 
  people do n't systematically remove the appendix either , only if there 's a problem . 
   calling circumcision mutilation i did n't call it mutilation in my comment though . 
   it has no negative effects apparently it makes your penis less sensitive and i 'd definitely count that as a negative . 
  most of this was outside of what i was talking about though . 
  what i was talking about was that people should n't confuse opposition to circumcision done for religious or cultural reason to circumcision done for acute medical reason . 
  i have n't heard people being against the latter but being against the former is pretty common . 
  people are n't arguing against cutting for medical reasons , when those medical reasons arise . 
  where does this misconception come from ? 
  kinda like how people would be against ceremonial surgeries on babies but be completely fine with surgeries for medical reasons . 
  do you get what i mean ? 
   no *** britain *** come back we want to rule over you '' but *** england *** newest members wales , scotland and northern ireland confirmed, 
  seeing this is a humorous post from a known comedian , i guess it 's to amuse people . 
  what do you think the point was ? 
  terrible . 
  take a lap . 
   besides finland , which is n't scandinavian . 
  but there 's a short time germany ruled denmark and norway , but that 's hardly relevant language-wise, 
   there are more than 215 native portuguese speakers . 
  yeah that 's a pretty safe bet, 
  what do you mean by `` dishonest '' ? 
  bombardiers to their stations, 
   cousine `` cousine f ( genitive cousine , plural cousinen ) female cousin . '', 
  huh . 
  but yeah , cuisine , thanks !, 
  mud cakes with snow . 
  i guess it would go well with our bark bread . 
  those glass houses are built according to the meticulous health and safety standards and are impervious to your stones . 
  hmmm ... 
  i wonder what are some of the delicious food they have in syria and iraq . 
  i wonder if in few years we 'll be stuffing our faces with some of their * cuisine . 
  yeah , i was speaking in general as in , what it means to be a free country and be a member of eu ( or similar organization ) . 
  how saying that they 're a `` free country , in a free world '' does n't mean much when they 've freely chosen to be a part of an organization with binding rules . 
  i think i confused a lot of people because i did n't make it clear enough in my first comment that i was n't talking about corporate tax issue in particular , but overall how even a free country in a free world does n't get to do `` whatever fuck they want '' while being an eu member , for example . 
   well , you are very wrong about that . 
  about what ? 
  i think i 've confused a lot of people because i was talking in general how they ca n't do `` what the fuck they like '' even though they 're a free country , because they 've freely agreed to join the eu and that comes with certain benefits and certain responcibilities . 
  like , in a hypothetical scenario where eu enacts some anti-tax haven law ( or could be a binding un decision to ban whiskey , or whatever ) , a free country that chooses to be part of that sort of organization , still has to follow binding rules even if they 're free . 
  so saying `` ireland is a free country in a free world '' does n't really mean they 're free to do as they please , as long as they 're a member . 
  hopefully i made my point clear now . 
  i did n't mean to imply they were violating any treaties , i meant that if for example eu collectively decided to crack down on tax havens and made it into a binding rule , even though ireland is a free country they 'd still have an obligation to follow that rule , unless they left the eu . 
  but they 're still very much a free country in a free world because they 're able to make that decision freely . 
  that was my point . 
   there has always assurances that ireland could decide its own tax rate . 
  when we voted in the lisbon treaty that was a huge focal point . 
  i was n't speaking about this question in particular , but in a more general fashion , in which `` our country , our rules '' is n't really true when as a member of the eu every country has conceded some decision and rule making power to the eu and some of their rules and regulations `` outrank '' those made in the member states . 
   you all want to change it to be something different but ireland ( and other countries ) has to be on board for that to happen . 
  besides the point i know , but who is `` you all '' in this case ? 
   telling us to fuck off is n't how this works . 
  who has told you to `` fuck off '' ? 
  i certainly have n't . 
  my point was simply that `` our rules , our country '' is n't really true for countries that have conceded some rule making power to some else , in this case to the eu and if someone wants to have absolute power to decide all rules by themselves , membership in the eu is probably not going to work out for them . 
  ( though even without the eu there 's still all kinds of international treaties and whatnot . ),
