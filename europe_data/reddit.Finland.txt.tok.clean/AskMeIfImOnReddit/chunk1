winters will get darker when there 's no snow . 
  then summers might get too hot . 
  then horrible tropical diseases arrive . 
  survivors will have to endure those dark , dreary and depressing months with the added burden of mourning for their friends and family . 
  suicide rates go up . 
  economy plummets . 
  anarchy washes over the cities and towns . 
  finns will stand 0.5 m closer to each other on bus stops . 
  it will be total chaos . 
  . . i wish it was colder . 
  yes . 
  100 % agreed . 
  i love finnish pronunciation rules but everything else about our language is just varying degrees of confusing and painful . 
  til latvia was right all along . 
  happiness is ( made of ) potatoes . 
  that 's one of those stupid words that was invented by someone for a longest-word competition and does n't actually mean anything . 
  if you ca n't rib your family , they are n't family . 
  there was an ad on tv , about some cream , that said `` the best weapon against wrinkles is happiness and q10 . '', 
  so i turned to my mom and asked `` so . . which one are you lacking ? '', 
  she glared at me , then laughed . 
  hi welcome , i 'm dad ? 
  do n't worry , guys , we 've got this . 
  come to finland . 
  form the swamp monster union we 've always dreamed of . 
  i 'd be more surprised if there was n't . 
  `` on taottava , kun rauta on kuumaa '' ~ '' ( you must/should ) forge , when the iron is hot . '',

  give the usa back to hiawatha first . 
   a more practical example would be you having your gun safe unlocked and someone taking your weapon to commit a crime . 
  in this case you 'd have neglected safety measures and you 'd be liable . 
  but what if your gun safe actually was locked and then someone simply broke the lock ( hacked into your wifi ) ? 
  would you still say the owner is liable ? 
  how much security is enough ? 
  ditching the analogy , what if there was a firmware update that accidentally made your router vulnerable and allowed someone to establish a child porn site ? 
  is the owner still responsible ? 
  is the manufacturer/software developer responsible ? 
  that 's why laws like this are fucked up . 
   someone breaks into your house selling drugs from there . 
  police arrests you because it 's you 're house . 
  alternatively , someone starts using the trashcan next to your driveway as a dead drop for drug dealing . 
  if the police checked inside your house , they 'd find no evidence of drugs or drug dealing , but they still arrest you because it 's your trashcan ... is this getting weird or is it just me ? 
  better analogy ( ? 
  ) : while running from police , with drugs in his pockets , a criminal breaks through your front door and escapes out the back . 
  because the drugs passed through your house , the police arrest you . 
  have you seen the average brit ? 
  what kinda crazy nut would wan na fuck that ? 
  no ^ wonder ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ welsh ^ ^ ^ ^ prefer ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sheep . 
  i heard the system is most likely to be used during disasters/accidents like radiation leaking from nuclear reactors , chemical spills with possible deadly gases or fumes , etc. 
  of couse , it could also be used during war time . 
  naturally they have to test the sirens regularly for maintenance . 
  about 1/3 of all europeans , mostly around germany = `` almost every person in europe '' now ? 
  in that case i guess almost all europeans speak french too ( about 1/4 in reality ) and literally everyone speaks english ( actually 1/2 ) . 
   british summer i thought that was just a myth . . 
  it 's so easy to just leave your brain on autopilot while you do things . 
  then you do something stupid , something you would n't have done if you had thought about it a little , and suddenly you 're super fucked , possibly even dead . 
  we are all idiots .

  make sure you get lots of bug spray or those mosquito smoke thingies . 
  finland is full of the fucking blood suckers in summer . 
  also sun screen . 
  becomes more important the further north you go , because the magnetic field gets thinner . 
  super easy to get sun burnt . 
  and , if you ca n't sleep when it 's too bright , either get one of those eye masks or find a place with thick curtains . 
  jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 gets a few hours of dusk between 10pm and 2am in midsummer and , again , it gets worse further north . 
  or as my dad likes to call it : jykytsalo . 
  hell yes !, 
  correct . 
  it 's a frozen wasteland all the way to norway . 
  yes , because we do n't have good things . 
  santa is a white walker !, 
  us northernerners need to stick together against the south .

  you 've clearly never been outside of helsinki if you seriously think either of those are true .
