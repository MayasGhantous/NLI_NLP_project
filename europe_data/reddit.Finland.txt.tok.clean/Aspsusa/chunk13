  here 's the offerings at [ humboldt ] ( https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/studies/counselling/course-catalogue/master/ma ) and [ freie universit\u00e4t berlin ] ( http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/studium/studienangebot/english/ ) . 
  just saying that you might need to find out what what you want to study is called in the snobbish world of european academia to find a good school . 
  it does n't seem to be called `` advertising '' at the top schools . 
  `` masters in advertising '' sounds very weird to my ears , almost like a contradictions in terms , ie not an academic subject . 
  but maybe i 'm just old ? 
  or maybe you need to widen your search , look at possibly related fields like marketing , psychology ( organisational etc ) , communication - stuff like that ? 
  or widen the search from `` university '' to schools called something else ? 
  hot chocolate milk on weetabix makes a nice almost-porridge :-) loads of cereals in stores here . 
  no idea how popular they are , only eat them occasionally myself , prefer porridge or yoghurt or eggs or a cheese sandwich or ... 
  hares , hedgehogs , squirrels , pigeons , ducks , swans , sparrows , assorted tits and other birds . 
  probably mice , rats and frogs too . 
  small lizards . 
  and insects of course . 
  also nasty wild geese that we did n't have before . 
  and rabbits . 
  lots of rabbits . 
  but those i do n't count as native . 
  would n't want to count the swans either , nasty birds . 
  helsinki ( central-ish , south ) . 
  til . 
  thank you . 
  on a related note it is ridiculous how many dances ( at least in the nordic countries ) have poland-related names : - polka - polska/pols - polonaise - mazurka, 
  that 's nice to hear !, 
  but you will be coming from amsterdam , perhaps via belgium or france ( no idea what would be the best route , sorry ) , will the dogs need to have their `` passports '' stamped in each country ? 
  ( sorry , the stereotype is that the brits are _ crazy _ about their animals . ), 
  has the uk given up on quarantining dogs ? 
  you mean that the vat is 0 % . 
  it is still included in the advertised price - the consumer will never be hit with a vat or sales tax on top of the price quoted . 
  in business-to-business prices can be given without vat , even if it applies and is more than 0 % . 
  i agree on what you said ( very well put in fact ) , but violently disagree that this makes the statement `` it only applies to the markup '' sort of correct : when you price an item ( or a service ) for sale you calculate the vat on the full price . 
  period . 
  the fact that companies ( if they are obliged to pay vat , ie collect it on behalf of the state ) can deduct vat from their own purchases does n't play one bit into how it is calculated . 
  here 's an example : i 'm vat registered and i sell `` tea party experiences '' . 
  let 's say this fabulous entertainment costs the end user 200 euros + vat . 
  let 's say the vat is 20 % . 
  my customer pays me 240 euros ( 1.2 x 200 = 240 ) . 
  of this 240 euros i now owe the state 40 euros . 
  but my business has bought tea , cakes , napkins , the services of a pastry chef . 
  on all of these things my business has paid vat . 
  from the 40 euros vat owed i can now subtract the vat i have already paid , let us say it was something like : 0.30 ( cheap tea ) , 0 ( no vat on food in this example - actually many countries do have vat on food , but it is usually lower ) ) 0.47 ( fancy napkins ! ), 
  4 ( services of pastry chef ) in total 4.77 . 
  so vat owed is 40-4 .77 = 35.33 but wait , i can also deduct the vat on everything else my company has bought ( within reason ) : pens , phone bills , cleaning service , fancy china set , repair of computer etc. 
  so i might even end up with a negative vat bill one month ( if my sales are slow and i have lots of costs ) . 
  where it gets a bit more complicated is in intra-eu stuff ( if i buy my tea or pens from another eu-country ) . 
  right on the tax , wrong on how it is calculated . 
  it is calculated on the total price , but in some instances something may include two * different * vats - transport , medicine , books , food is for instance often taxed at another rate . 
  so in some cases something might include two different vats - but this is rare , and mostly applicable to when you buy stuff from outside the eu and then have to pay the vat ( s ) yourself . 
  for americans it might be worth noting that all goods and services offered to consumers must be priced inclusive of vat . 
  do n't have any personal experiences of any of the places as a student , that said : lund is a nice , rather small city with a very old university , and from what i 've heard an active student life ( with loooong traditions ) . 
  from an urban planning perspective it might be an interesting location for you , because while the city itself is old , medieval cathedral and all , it is very close to malm\u00f6 and the whole malm\u00f6-\u00d6resund-copenhagen cross-border growth region . 
  if it 's any consolation i 've heard quite a few jokes ( in swedish , in finland ) with a formula something like `` a finn , a swede , a frenchman and a german '' - nationalities vary . 
  the jokey bit about the german is usually that he writes a kurze einf\u00fchrung in 4 or 6 volumes . 
  other stereotypical things about other nations , but in these types of jokes you guys are nearly always included . 
  thx - i was thinking dunkirk ... < sheepish facepalm  incidentally finland had it 's own variation of this , but with kids sent to sweden * . 
  no idea if that is in any school curriculum now ( or even when i went to school 20 + years ago , just ca n't remember ) . 
  * that 's the thing that is remembered , but i 'm pretty sure kids were evacuated from major cities to the countryside , as well , but more informally . 
  which evacuation ? 
  thanks - that was fascinating . 
  especially since i do n't really know french ( never studied it ) - gave an interesting window into french grammar !, 
  some of the things he talked about was familiar to me from my grandmother , who learned french as a young person ( 1920-ies ) , but only started to try to learn some english much later in life ( 1950 -  ) . 
  she became a fluent reader in english , but hated speaking it . 
  i think there is one key thing that makes our multi-lane city streets work : public transport . 
  without bus stops and tram stops there would be fewer pedestrians =  not enough people to sustain shops and caf\u00e9s and what not . 
  possibly one could substitute underground parking , but then that would change the nature of the street considerably - less reason to actually walk along the sidewalk . 
  i 'd think you 'd feel safe as a pedestrian , but feeling safe is n't the same as feeling * comfortable * . 
  i wonder if the discussion you are having is partly due to you and your interlocutors meaning different things by words like `` comfortable '' and `` friendly '' . 
  let me explain : even in tiny helsinki , where our largest high-traffic street is only something like 2 + tram +2 lanes wide , it is not exactly * pleasant * to walk there ( especially if there are no trees lining the sidewalk ) , but it is perfectly safe and convenient for shops situated there , bus stops , tram stops , caf\u00e9s etc. 
  but it is not `` friendly '' , `` nice '' , `` pleasant '' in the sense that it would be the route to take if you are just out walking for it 's own sake . 
  then you would minimize the time spent along high traffic streets and prefer walking along smaller streets and parks . 
  i can envision that in a future with a majority electric or hybrid cars and buses this could change - it is mostly the noise that makes it unattractive . 
  looks good , realistic and relaxed to me !, 
  no need for cars in cities , and you 'll have plenty to do without getting out in the countryside . 
  when you start planning more in detail , leave enough open time to just saunter around doing nothing . 
  getting on a tram to nowhere in particular is a great way of discovering the vibe of a city . 
  going to local shops/markets and just having a few drinks in non-touristy places are much more fun than just sightseeing all the time . 
  having decent ** off-line ** maps on your phone is a good idea ( i like `` maps with me '' on android - making stuff from google maps available offline does n't catch everything , so do n't rely on google maps off-line for tram stops and things like that ) . 
  not a specific caf\u00e9 , but for a city that takes its coffee really seriously lviv in ukraine is hard to beat . 
  pastries too . 
  the only names i remember off the top of my head is kavy svit ( or was it svit kavy ? , world of coffee/coffee world anyway ) and veronika . 
  veronika is like a paradise for anyone who likes pastries and handmade chocolate . 
  beats anything i 've seen in vienna , bratislava , prague etc. 
  but there are loads more - the whole city is like seriously nuts about caf\u00e9 culture . 
  more viennese than vienna , and extremely serious about the quality of the actual coffee . 
  ( or maybe the whole country is like that ? 
  - i noticed in kiev that the quality of the coffee from the coffee trucks parked on every corner was generally very very good ) . 
  but it is also not normal to be an atheist ** activist ** - i think most people would find that odd , or just silly . 
  knowing a bit about our own religious heritage , maybe even belonging to the church and/or using it for some ceremonies , is considered normal and part of cultural competency . 
  taking religion seriously , as in believing or actively not believing , is considered weird . 
  and consequently being a very outspoken atheist is also considered a bit weird . 
  a few times a year ? 
  it varies . 
  at least once a year germany ( boring trade fair ) , then usually a road trip in the summer , either scandinavia or baltics/poland/further . 
  sometimes a short-ish trip , `` city-break '' type , either some nice german city or somewhere else - last year this was kiev . 
  and we might pop over to tallinn for a day or two . 
  just because , or to buy booze for a bigger party or something . 
  wish i could upvote this more . 
  except for bulgaria and the former yugoslavia and albania i think i have visited all former eastern bloc countries . 
  sure , the more west you are ( baltics , poland and czech r ) the more `` normal '' ( ie like germany or scandinavia ) it feels , but slovakia , ukraine , romania and hungary are perfectly nice and safe countries to visit . 
  good for road trips by car , nice landscapes . 
  our old car does n't have eu-plates , so you ca n't see exactly where we 're from just looking at the front of the car , so we 've been flagged down by traffic police many times for routine checks on our trips .
