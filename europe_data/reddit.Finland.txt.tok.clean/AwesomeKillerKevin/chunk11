  the osce was not permitted to monitor the so called referendum because crimea was not a full fledged state recognized by the osce or the un general assembly . 
  and ukraine which is an osce member did not authorize , the russian federation also did not request the osce to foresee the referendum . 
  ( if they did it would admit guilt that they were the masterminds of the entire thing ) . 
  plus they were not permitted in crimea anyways because the newly appointed pm of crimea sergei aksyonov [ told osce observers to leave ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/15/thwarted-crimea-mission-of-osce-observers ) before the referendum even took place . 
  even whether there were osce members there or not . 
  the un general assembly already voted that the crimea referendum was invalid by [ resolution 68/262 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_68/262 ), 
  who knows , maybe michel barnier is payback for the conservatives appointing boris johnson as head of foreign affairs . 
  he has [ insulted ] ( http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/updated-a-map-of-all-the-countries-boris-johnson-has-offended--w1zatlc63rw ) a ton of countries . 
  i did n't say it was the official anthem . 
   officially from our national anthem ... 
  i said it meaning that i am quoting that finland 's national concept is the father 's land if you are using maammee . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  i must of mixed up `` v\u00e5rt fosterland '', 
  oh sure . 
  like picking boris johnson for head of foreign ministry is totally not like the same thing as michel barnier . 
  seeing all the countries boris johnson has personally [ insulted . 
  ] ( http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/updated-a-map-of-all-the-countries-boris-johnson-has-offended--w1zatlc63rw ), 
  its just a piece of uninhabited land , would n't cost norway anything , and its a good piece of symbolism . 
  officially from our national anthem we are the `` fatherland '' . 
  probably the most common expression relating to national concepts is `` big neighbor '' referring to russia . 
  finnish independence was in 1917 . 
  so 2017 = 100 years of stronk finland, 
   getting it without minorities on them died shame that baltic demographics are n't catching up so well ;(, 
  nooo ;(, 
  how did i lie ? 
  the [ osce website ] ( http://www.osce.org/cio/116313 ) right there confirmed they did not monitor the referendum . 
  the un human rights council also did not monitor the referendum because they were not allowed to and the un general assembly voted in favor of [ resolution 68/262 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_68/262 ) in which there were a 10 to 1 ratio of nations declaring the referendum illegal . 
  yeah i totally agree . 
  i dude i knew in crimea snapped me a pic of the actual ballot paper ( you can find it online as well probably ) the choices were either join the russian federation or restore the 1992 constitution . 
  ( which meant crimea would be `` autonomous '' ) in all honesty if the vote was legitimate and crimeans voted the second option there 's no way russian troops are going to simply walk off of crimea after occupying it . 
  entertaining as hell . 
  although russia is more likely to invade finland than norway in any chance . 
  great , another idiot . 
  you realize that finland has only accepted 30,000 refugees . 
  and over 89 % of our population is homogeneous finns . 
  rt news is very horrible . 
  they do n't even bother covering up their bs when they make a mistake . 
  us should probably investigate its own ball park before it starts with eu . 
  how so ? 
  i really doubt the election committee or whatever agency wo n't try to prosecute the nominee of the republican party as they did n't do with clintons email . 
   why would the goverment of sar use chemical weapons against civilians , as they have nothing to gain and everything to loose its the same reason why sar uses cluster bombs and occasionally massacres civilians . 
  they can simply get away with it . 
  syria did not develop chemical weapons for no reason . 
  you can say the same thing about what assad has from gaining by [ killing his own citizens ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_during_the_syrian_civil_war ) assad has ** nothing to loose ** when he used chemical weapons . 
  he already has the support of russia , killing civilians or using chemical weapons is not going to deter russia from supporting assad . 
  cluster bombs , massacres , chemical weapons , and executions are apart of the daily struggle and tactics assad chooses to use to regain control of syria . 
  during the early stages of the 2011 syrian uprising assad used chemical weapons against protestors because chemical warfare is effective . 
  chemical weapons are very effective against protesting cities where civilians have no preparation for chemical warfare . 
  its the same exact reason why saddam hussein used chemical weapons during the iran-iraq war . 
  he could get away from it and it was an effective weapon against the lightly armored iranian forces . 
  you realize that russia 's official stance on the matter was rebels used chemical weapons , not the united states . 
  and the chemical attack happened in a [ rebel held city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war#continued_fighting_.28july.e2.80.93october_2013.29 ) ** you still have not provided evidence , or even a single source for that matter that the us was behind the chemical weapons plot . 
  ** i still ca n't believe you think assad was a hero . 
  [ he started this whole mess by using the syrian army to fire at protestors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_uprising_phase_of_the_syrian_civil_war )  my version is probable , your version has a lot of mental gymnastics that involve france turning red . 
  no my theory is just as probable . 
  russia already admitted to using the syrian crisis to increase the flow of refugees . 
  the terrorist attackers were probably under cover kgb officers trained in syria . 
  my theory makes as much sense as yours . 
  and you have n't dis-proven it . 
   the conspiracies exist because the evidence is unclear . 
  some conspiracies are crazy , yes , but some are `` plausible '' . 
  ** you still have not given a single piece of evidence or a source of usa involvement in the chemical attack ** your theory is not plausible . 
  you have n't even presented evidence . 
   im talking about post war . 
  the only way to not have syria split into a thousand tribes and quasi goverments is to have a strong , central goverment body . 
  currently assad is the only way . 
  well the war looks like it has no end in sight . 
  so you basically admit * assad is worse than the rebels . 
  * there is no indication that syria will split up into a million pieces . 
  even if it did , i do n't understand why that would exactly be a bad thing . 
  assad is not holding the central government up . 
  its currently russia . 
  without russia , assad would n't of been able to get on the offensive let alone defend the territory it has . 
  iraq did n't blow up in a million pieces when saddam was toppled . 
  all we need is the international community to come to together when this is over and institutionalize it once again . 
  i am not grasping at straws , my explanation is logical and pretty straightforward . 
  + whats the point of sourcing things if its common knowledge it is not logical or straightforward as no other source holds the opinion you have . 
  and you have ** presented no evidence or sources . 
  ** again your joke of an explanation makes as much sense as my paris attacks . 
  and you have n't dis-proven my theory . 
  #please source some evidence pretty sure you are a troll . 
   yes . 
  it was extremely convenient for fsa and usa . 
  president of us says that chemical weapons are the red line , and conveniently a short while later they are used against civilians . 
  seems like a covert operation to me . 
  convenience is not evidence . 
  please give one source that even gives credible evidence to entertain your claim . 
  the un human rights council investigation into the ghouta chemical attack found that , `` significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned indiscriminate attack targeting civilian-inhabited areas , causing mass casualties . 
  the evidence available concerning the nature , quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 august indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the ** syrian army . 
  '' **  assad was not stupid , that action would be completely unnecessary , and only damaging the regime , he also knew what happened to saddam dude you are grasping at straws . 
  you are not holding your side of the argument to the same scrutiny . 
  if your argument is that the us would invade syria if it used chemical weapons as a pretext , then its completely flawed . 
  seeing that a ) obama made the decision to not send large scale ground forces into syria , even against republicans , in 2011 . 
  the chemical attacks happened in 2013 . 
  and b ) the un human rights council , eu , us , canada , gcc ( in which nearly every middle eastern country is against syria ) pin the blame on the syrian government . 
  i can just easily say that ** russia planned the paris 2015 attack so france would increase its involvement and help cooperate with russia against forces in syria . 
  ** see ? 
  its * very * convenient for russia to take advantage of france 's grievances . 
  your statement and my example is the very reason why we do n't entertain these stupid conspiracy theories based on no facts .
