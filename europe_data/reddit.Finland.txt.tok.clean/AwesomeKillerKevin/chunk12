  the syrian government is much worse than the rebels as shown [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_during_the_syrian_civil_war ) seeing they 've committed much more mass murders and in greater causality scales than rebel groups have . 
  if trump gets elected and he refuses to defend the integrity of nato both houses of congress will no doubt turn on him . 
  there are well above enough establishment based republicans in his own party that would rather impeach their own president than tear down a century of us foreign policy . 
  you can not deny that his close advisors * have * ties to russia one way or another . 
  and his advisors have openly shared their opinions about russia . 
  finland shares a bigger border with russia than the rest of the eu combined . 
  in all honesty the best you can do is to keep open dialogue and slowly scale defensive infrastructure . 
  it was / s, 
   they boycotted the referendum . 
  it was n't exactly the best referendum ever held to put it mild , however they have wanted one since the dissolution of the ussr and ukraine never gave them one . 
  dude , there was boycotting but not that widespread . 
  having 96.77 % is a ridiculous amount . 
  seeing that tartars make up around 10 % of the population , ethnic ukrainians 24 % . 
  having a referendum in a region where no osce or international observers were permitted to monitor the referendum , while under ** armed occupation ** clearly throws the referendum out as illegitimate . 
  and the general assembly of the un overwhelming ruled the referendum as illegitimate . 
  and only countries such as cuba , syria , and north korea recognize the referendum . 
  not even china recognizes it . 
   had their been a fair referendum , the odds are a large majority would 've voted for russia . 
  ( though not in the 90 % range , mor like 60-70 % ) i can say the same thing . 
  russia new they would not get crimea legitimately . 
  so thats why they had to do the referendum under armed occupation without osce or international observers to judge the fairness of the referendum . 
  it was n't even recognized , smh . 
  because occupying a region with military troops and having a referendum in the next day is a totally legitimate way to calculate popular vote . 
   so what . 
  props to putin for that . 
  he could n't do it better , and i honestly think thats genius . 
  you realize that poland is in europe too right ? 
  you seem to be a kremlin bot by wanting to self warm your own countrys well being . 
   either ** usa ** or fsa has done that , as it was extremely convenient for them , and totally against goverment interests . 
  this here is the only speculation in this post . 
  alright you 're obviously a kremlin bot . 
  you are really subscribing to this ridiculous conspiracy theory ? 
  its not fair that you can dispell any judgements and not hold yourself to your own standards . 
  ** assad is clearly worse ** than the rebels , by just looking at the list the syrian government killed more of its people times over than the rebels . 
  its a pretty clear sign of it being unfair , as it has been rightly called . 
  seeing that there are american , german , british , and canadian soldiers in eastern europe they provide the perfect tripwire . 
  it would be insane for any country , especially the united states to back off when 1,000 of your own troops have been attacked . 
  some us politicians were calling for war with iran when they captured some us sailors . 
  surely a thousand dead us soldiers is going to spark some ass kicking of some kind . 
  germany does n't have any choice . 
  germany is the heartland of the eu , if the eu feels threatened it has to respond to its members needs or watch the entire european project break down . 
  in this current situation germany is providing the soft power and the united states is providing the hard stick if everything goes downhill . 
  france and the uk have a bigger military budget than russia , germany comes close . 
  france/uk spend less than 2 % of their gdp on their military , while russia is spending anywhere around 5.0 % -5.5 % during economic upheaval and unrest , and can not even match western countries spending . 
  there 's a difference between appeasement and not trying to stir up the pot and make the situation worse . 
  without us support no doubt western countries would have to take a bigger role . 
  but more or less likely any increased russian aggression will result in the us in keeping the rest of nato in line and obligated to their security guarantees . 
  for example the rotation of 4 battalions in eastern europe . 
  the us can very easily supply all four of those on battalions with its own troops , but it wants to make sure europe has some skin in the game and blood to spill incase things go downhill so it wo n't have to take chief responsibility of the situation such as in ukraine . 
  its true sweden has not been in a full out war in 200 years but sweden has most definitely been involved in the geopolitics of conflict in europe . 
  sweden had to make several compromises for its neutrality in the second world war . 
  it had to transport the 163rd german infantry division through swedish rails to norway for the eastern front . 
  and sweden had to continuously sell its iron ore to nazi germany . 
  and granted , sweden participated and helped finland by sending volunteers and ` unofficial ' military equipment to finland 's aid in the winter war . 
  i personally do n't think the reason sweden has been at relative peace for 200 years has much to do with how it carries itself as a nation ( although sweden is a model for democracy and peace ) . 
  but more or less likely just luck and geopolitics . 
  think about it . 
  sweden was the only nordic country that did not get invaded during ww2 . 
  iceland got occupied by the allies . 
  norway and denmark were occupied by nazi germany steadfast . 
  finland tried following the exact same foriegn policy approach as sweden did during the second world war but nothing could convince the soviets otherwise and finland had to fight the grueling winter war and later the continuation war . 
  ( in finland we view both wars as one ) look at this [ map . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_during_world_war_ii#/media/file:sweden_locator_map_1942.svg ) if finland fell to the soviet union and was annexed as a puppet state . 
  do you really think sweden would of avoided war ? 
  nazi norway and soviet controlled finland share a border together , and no doubt sweden would be a warzone as finland was during the eastern front , adding onto that the critical swedish ore mines that nazi germany had to protect the supply of . 
  even during the cold war , sweden secretly maintained close ties with the united states in fear of the soviet union . 
  the famed `` mysterious submarines '' that have been engraved in swedish culture during the cold war were mostly nato submarines in the west of sweden such as the a-1 polaris in exchange for a security guarantee . 
  the us also had a helping hand in developing sweden 's saab 37 viggen and anti-submarine capabilities . 
  more or less likely donald trump is just ignorant , his advisors are a different story : http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing, 
  many of donald trumps advisors have ties to russian businesses . 
  http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing this had a very good detailed article on it . 
  its no mystery that russia tends to fund separatist and anti-establishment groups throughout europe and the western world . 
  if you look at some of the main euro-skeptic groups , like national front for example , its scary how passive they are on their russian policy . 
  even in the united states , there is tangling within the system . 
  ( us news rumors that putin leaked dnc files to give donald trump a boost ) . 
  and yeah , with donald trump in the us threatening to disband nato , and seeing that some of his advisors have connections to russian business , thats scary . 
  sadly populism has no bounds of reason . 
  russia has no friends , not even really long term partners . 
  cuba and venezuela are too far from reach of russia 's influence , and have little reward but a lot of risk . 
  belarus is just a cannon fodder infront of nato , and lukanshanko and vladimir putin are best of friends , its a relationship of necessity . 
  lukanshanko needs subsided oil to keep his regime up and russia needs a buffer between the west . 
  belarus is smart enough , after ukraine , to try to press off russian pressures to add an air force base in their territory . 
  russia needs china more than china needs russia . 
  granted at this rate china will not need to mass import russian oil and russian military technology in a decade or so . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how russia and turkey will have any meaningful relationship . 
  both russia and turkey are solid on their stance on syria , i see no real way for turkey to give up its regime change goals in syria which is the underbelly of turkey . 
  its probably just more pr for domestic media back home at russia and a boost from isolationism in the international community . 
  may i recommend a [ book ? 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/mindset-psychology-success-carol-dweck/dp/0345472322 ), 
  plot twist : europe switches to 100 % renewable energy . 
  russia loses its entire federal budget . 
   hail the royal tits, 
  well thats not fair , you can say the same exact thing about brexit . 
  and we * know * how that turned out . 
  either way i find it baffling that [ nearly 97 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) of people in crimea voted that way . 
  seeing there are the tartars and some ethnic ukrainians who are against russia . 
  but what is done is done . 
  it really has done no good , seeing that only countries with horrible human rights records even [ recognize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#reactions ) crimea 's secession . 
  there 's a difference between refugees and the rebels fighting assad . 
  the refugees overwhelmingly are not in support of assad .
