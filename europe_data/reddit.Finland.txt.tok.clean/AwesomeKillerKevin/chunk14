  russia [ directly funds ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12103602/america-to-investigate-russian-meddling-in-eu.html ) euroskeptic parties in the eu such as the national front . 
  i did n't downvote and i 'm not complaining russia is stuffing its borders, 
  who would n't expect russia to push back . 
  finland is doing alright , it has mainly hurt our agriculture , but russia is dropping from our top export markets pretty fast . 
  its predictable that since finland and russia share over a 1,300 km border that trade will considerably hurt the smaller partner . 
  the treaty gives turkey ( and the ussr ) considerable power . 
  us ships ( which are apart of nato ) are allowed in the black sea as long as they are in caucus with turkish defense . 
  turkey itself can be considered in a state of war against extremism in south of its border . 
  the us operates many naval detachee 's and air force bases within turkish territory . 
  from what i read turkey allows us vessels in the black sea as `` apart of its territorial defense '', 
  in all honesty though there is a compelling argument for estonia to be a ` nordic country ' with our shared language . 
  and the better part of estonia was under the swedish empire as finland was . 
  although its not really the swedish language that holds finland apart of the nordics , as sweden is becoming more of a burden to learn as its one of our official languages . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm always thinking about what life would be like if finland did n't hold on as it did during the winter war . 
  who knows , maybe if finland fell within a month to the soviets , and was annexed , sweden most likely would of been brought into the skirmish with nazi norway and soviet finland fighting over sweden 's precious ore mines . 
  instead of criticizing nato for its overt military action , although some of it is justified . 
  just stop and think why so many countries have a dislike for russia in this current period in history ? 
  but its technically a nato ship , not a us ship . 
  checkmate atheists / s and i 'm pretty sure that treaty went out of action when ww2 happened . 
  finland would be laughing at russia 's economy right now only if our economy was n't considerably attached to theirs . 
  did sweden find those russian subs yet ? 
  curious tho , swedish public opinion has more support for nato than finland . 
  i 'm no expert but russia ( voluntarily ) agreed to back off of cuba after negotiating with america . 
  yeah , the whole point of nato is to counter russia . 
  were you asleep in history class during the cold war ? 
  26 of the 28 nato member states are in europe . 
  if they want more nato support do n't go blaming the united states . 
  it is a little weird though that besides estonians and finnish peoples shared linage with our finnic-ugric language , we 've been mostly separate , and nothing much to do with each other besides being neighbors . 
  most likely will stay that due to the geopolitical past and current political and military arrangements . 
  borders between russia and finland were finalized . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_ ( russian % e2 % 80 % 93finnish ) . 
  and during the finnish war of independence lenin at the time i believe agreed to the borders set . 
  there are some that support it , but overall there is n't wide public support , in either finland or russia . 
  maybe this wiki article will help you answer any questions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelian_question, 
  most of them [ left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evacuation_of_finnish_karelia ) during the war . 
  the karelians that are there , most likely more identify with being russian than any finnic ancestry , seeing that some 75 years have passed . 
  nobody in finland really has any political will to try to negotiate taking karelia back . 
  as you said , russians populate karelia more than karelians themselves , and with intermingling for about 75 some years now more karelians probably identity for with russia than their finno-ugric heritage now . 
  not to mention the fact that there would be a huge economic burden on finland for integrating karelia into the main country . 
  and with our current economic troubles there 's really not much to gain . 
  russia has n't exactly kept karelia in good care either , its one of the poorest republics within russia , and has alot of failing infrastructure . 
  not much there besides military bases , outsource roading for st. petersburg , and an area for russian oil pipes to get into the baltic sea . 
  [ public support ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelian_question#polls_and_popular_opinion ) tends to agree that its better not to make a fuss about something deep in the past . 
  i think the trump-putin relationship is more built on ignorance than any real connection . 
  donald can be quoted saying `` hes a very strong leader '' to about any autocratic figure in politics from china in tiananmen square to the whole turkey coup . 
  honestly all of russia 's political union plans to retain influence over former ussr states have failed , whether it be the eeu , eurasian customs union , or ctso . 
  ukraine was the second most powerful member only to russia . 
  with ukraine gone it leaves a shabby future for the other countries in russia 's influence . 
  eeu would never compete with the eu on any significant scale , all of the other countries have strict political and economic regimes with little or no interest with interacting with the outside community . 
  can you source what european parliament members visited what russian opposition meetings ? 
  even so why is that a bad thing ? 
  russia is ~ ~ suppose to have ~ ~ a multi-polar political spectrum and not entirely run by a single state party . 
  israeli politicians visit republican politicans in washington dc and the democrats do n't seem to make a huge fuss over it . 
  georgia started hostilities against the separatists , but russia started the war against georgia . 
  georgia invaded the south ossetia capital after separatists started attacking villages . 
  granted georgia was waiting for a casus belli to retake georgia but after georgia attacked the south ossetia capital . 
  russian forces pushed back georgian forces as mandated , which was fine . 
  georgia announced to the un that they withdrew from ossetia territory and the un was going to rap up a peace deal . 
  but then after wards russia used it as an excuse to conduct operations against the entirety of georgia , and conducted air raids , naval strikes , and land invasion deep into georgian territory that went well above `` protecting '' south ossetia . 
  probably a better example would be china and singapore ( as singapore is mainly ethnic chinese ) . 
  great irony is china is still butthurt about singapore joining us defense initiatives . 
  we are n't in the 10th century anymore . 
  there 's a difference between self determination and having session for the point of giving your own ethnic group its own area to live . 
  in this globalized world all countries will or already have become more multi-cultural and multi-ethnic . 
  if we let every nation devolve and slice in self smaller along ethnic or political lines it would destroy progress that humankind has been developing into a uni-polar world . 
  why bother having political parties when you can just call session for people with your own views . 
  finland is a pretty hard language to learn if you are an english speaker . 
  but it has pretty logical grammar rules and is easy to read . 
  might wan na try your luck getting to canada . 
  in all honesty though i now understand why * some * americans tend to be very ignorant of the world outside it . 
  with over 300 million people and so much stuff going on in the us no wonder you guys have no time for international news . 
  finland is as stable as a rock and has a slow news cycle so we always rely on watching others . 
  europe has its share of demagogues too . . surprisingly some of them have actually won . 
  most likely from the nuclear deterrence of the cold war era . 
  dude , i do n't think you really know anything about the military or national defense . 
  saying * a few highly trained troops * is like call of duty talk of a 13 year old . 
  conscription has been apart of every armed forces since antiquity age . 
  the great empires in history , whether it be the greeks , romans , napoleon 's france , through nazi germany all used conscription to make their militarys an effective fighting point . 
  the whole point of conscription is to ** fill up the ranks of your armed forces when you have a lack of manpower ** even countries such as china , russia , and usa used conscription in wwii because they need to fill up their ranks . 
  whenever there is a war scenario countries ** always ** draft their citizens to defend the country . 
  in the case of a possible war or confrontation it is a good idea for countries to atleast train their populations to be reservists until the time arrives . 
  a conscription army is not very costly or hard to equip . 
  remember , the whole point of conscription is for territorial defense and total war . 
  you realize even the united states has conscription through selective services . 
  the us has over a million active personnel , and another million in reserves ( that will be conscripted first during war time ) and plenty of other paramilitary organizations . 
  what do you mean * a few highly trained troops ? 
  * you realize that countries use conscription not because they do n't want highly trained troops but its because they lack the necessary manpower to fill their ranks . 
  in most cases conscripts are used to fill logistics in the military , as for every one infantrymen there is there is a cook , repairman , doctor , coordinator , and driver to support them . 
  this is n't some sort of stupid thing where 100 special forces can take on 1,000 infantry . 
  even a highly trained army requires a very large and well equipped logistics division . 
  the uk has over 150,000 active duty and france over 200,000 active duty . 
  thats not a `` few highly trained '' troops . 
  russia has conscription because it has a huge problem with the lack of manpower , and add onto that , that they have the largest landmass on the planet bordering alot of unfriendly or unstable nations . 
  india needs its manpower because its an advantage it has in its population size and it needs to deter china and pakistan . 
  it should also be noted france and the uk are far away from danger from the middle east and russia , so they have no need to have conscription due to a lack of threat . 
  again , conscription is used to fill in essential roles due to lack of manpower . 
  and in the falkland wars the uk did not fare so much better as a first world military against a third world . 
  [ causalities in terms of air power were very similar and it was disastrous for the uk navy that lost 2 destroyers and 2 cruisers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war ) conscription works as a conventional deterrence , that 's exactly why in both world wars nearly every country had conscription .
