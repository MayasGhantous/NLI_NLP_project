  you can only have so many `` highly trained troops '' who all get wiped out within the first week of combat like japanese airmen against the us navy . 
  when you are talking about a total war scenario you can never have enough manpower , and you will deplete your active troop level fairly quickly . 
  the problems that most european countries suffer is a lack of manpower for their military . 
  whether it be the nordic countries , eastern european countries or central european countries , their populations will never match russia 's 125 million troop level . 
  they need conscription to fill the essential roles in their military , they are not trading off `` highly trained troops '' . 
  the problem with `` highly trained troops '' is you only have a limited number of them . 
  when war breaks out , most likely half of your `` highly trained troops '' will be mia and you ca n't defend your country because you made the choice not to train the rest of your population with military training . 
  government does n't give a crap as long as you pay taxes . 
  it is ridiculous how costly financial crimes are in finland though . 
  little ironic that the state has been banning western foods under the pretext of `` not meeting food standards . '', 
  finland exports large amounts of its food to russia but under sanctions it has of course slide down . 
  another reason to reduce gun control / s, 
  you can always have conventional deterrence without nuclear weapons . 
  st. petersburg and moscow are within range of european conventional artillery systems . 
  conscription is necessary when you do n't have enough personnel to fill in your ranks , even with good pay . 
  and just because we are in the twenty first century does not mean conventional warfare does n't apply . 
  the vast majority of russia 's military hardware and doctrine is still reliant on conventional tactics , and as shown in the russo-georgian war and ukraine crisis , countries with weak conventional arms can lose land pretty easily . 
  34,000 highly trained professionals wo n't do much against even against 150,000 conscripts , and if there was a war in the european theater it will most likely take place in a large scale land battle . 
  land battles require fielding of large infantry units regardless , along with logistics . 
  wars have been won plentiful by poorly trained grunts . 
  vietnam , soviet invasion of afghanistan , six days war . 
  if europe is going to be attacked * no doubt * it will take place in the conventional field , and when its total defense of the host country you 'd be silly to do away with conscription . 
  i do n't see how handing out more nuclear weapons will provide more deterrence . 
  hybrid warfare can just as easily make a scenario where nuclear weapons can not be used in uncertainly . 
  india-pakistan have a very unstable relationship , both with nuclear weapons and they 're stuck in a standstill . 
  would n't it be fine for countries like the uk , germany , italy , france , and other strong nato members who are away from chaos to have nuclear weapons ? 
  if i am correct , in nato nuclear deterrence is covered by article 5 . 
  i think its a good idea for countries to at least reinstate conscription to show they are serious . 
  finland , austria , and switzerland all have conscription , and they are neutral countries without nato . 
  the only nato countries that have conscription ( most of it selective ) is denmark , norway , greece , lithuania , and estonia . 
  and frankly conscription in those countries ( geopolitical ) wo n't do much for a game changer . 
  why does it matter what a country pays % for gdp ? 
  a country with a big economy ( like germany , # 1 in germany ) can afford to pay a smaller percentage of gdp to military and it can still be on par with economies smaller than its size ( like the uk ) that spend have to spend more . 
  germany and the uk virtually have [ comparable military ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=germany&amp;country2=united-kingdom&amp;submit=compare ) in terms of quantity of equipment and personnel but germany has to pay substantially less than the uk for the same bang for the buck . 
  another reason why the uk pays much more for its military because it wants a [ overseas presense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_overseas_military_bases#japan ) with over a dozen military bases while germany currently operates non outside of its territory . 
  again it has to do with different philosophy , germany still relies on soft power and is wiry about military force due to its history . 
  no one is forcing the uk to pay alot for its defense or keep oversea bases , same as no one is forcing the us to spend 3.5 % of its gdp on military expenditures . 
  countries like the uk do that voluntary because they want to maintain their prestige as a military power , that has n't stopped since the end of the british empire through the cold war . 
  and if i recall the united states operates around a dozen [ air force bases in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_air_force_in_the_united_kingdom ) and the uk itself has a distinguished modern air force that requires no assistance . 
  its much easier for allies to work together if they have joint bases in which they can operate in a theater . 
  and with the uk leaving the eu ; and possibility losing its economic and political title , it may not want to sacrifice its military prowess . 
  i 'm not an englishmen but thats my two cents . 
  you know the uk does n't even reach 2 % either . 
  its around ~ 1.9 if you remove non-defense related spending . 
  france and italy do their share . 
  france actually spends more on their military than the uk in terms of gdp per military spending . 
  and france has actually done operations in mali by itself practically . 
  the uk needs to hitch a ride with the us for its major operations nowdays . 
  same reason why us p-8 posiden planes had to do anti-submarine operations near the uk since the uk did n't have any available at the time . 
  the question is ~ ~ can the uk defend canada ~ ~, 
  whoa finland , we said we were n't a nato country !, 
  nato and a `` eu '' army is practically the same thing . 
  26 of 28 of nato members are european , and the whole point of nato in the first place was to be an ~ ~ anti-russian ~ ~ anti-communist bloc to secure europe . 
  not sure why an `` eu '' army would be any different , member states would have to combine their military industrial complexes and increase spending but its doable . 
  yeah , its sad that geopolitics in the past basically stays with you as a stain you can never unwash . 
  even though finland did n't exactly ` win ' against russia in wwii , if we were annexed like the baltics that would have repercussions for us in the present . 
  http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/12/media/cnn-russia-broadcasts/ new legislation was in place . 
  pundits say it was related to the 2014 ukraine crisis . 
  probably in the same ball park of russia mysteriously banning polish foods for ` not meeting standards ', 
  thats what i meant , i guess i meant blue water as the ability to access the open ocean . 
  but but b - they need their cars, 
  na man that would be * russophobia * and fueling the * new cold war *, 
  saddam was pretty devious in his [ purges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oynp5pnvwos ) as well . 
  ( not exactly sure why christopher hitchens is narrating this ), 
  jesus christ this is an actual purge . 
  well when there was that submarine scare in sweden , they did use their mine layer fleet and start dropping depth charges . 
  but more or less likely that was done as a warning , than an actual goal intended to sink russian submarines . 
  the uk would be included too , since the uk houses dozens of us airfields and a joint nuclear submarine base . 
  looks like its only france . 
  viva la france !!!, 
  the whole point of nato was to be an anti-communist ( russian ) block . 
  and no doubt russia is consistently a geopolitical challenge for the eu and the enlargement of the eu . 
  i would argue the us through the years has gotten to see nato as a nuisance from diverting forces back to europe when they should be focused on their pivot to asia . 
  its in the best interest of all european and nato members for turkey to be stable . 
  it is a gatekeeper to one of the two blue water ports russia has and is a good buffer between civilized europe and the chaos that is the middle east . 
  [ `` coalition of the willing '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_of_the_willing ) i 'm sure if turkey would be at war countries like france and germany would come up with a clever excuse to not participate as in iraq . 
  if you can ignore the us in nato surely you can ignore turkey . 
  yeah , those ~ ~ western english ~ ~ americans really have nothing going for them . 
  eh , the us is still the # 2 exporter, 
  maybe assad and erdogan are keeping all the good ones !, 
  i watched that debate on the refugee crisis . 
  i learned absolutely nothing from it . 
  inger st\u00f8jberg is dank though < 3, 
  the real question is ~ ~ why did n't they take the fucking shot ~ ~, 
  the real question is ~ ~ why did n't they take the fucking shot ~ ~, 
  well , * we technically already have did n't we ? 
  * although finland was not occupied by germany we were their allies during operation barbarossa . 
  kind of sucks , maybe if there was some way there could be a connector between helsinki and tallinn . 
  does n't estonia have very large shale oil reserves or something ? 
  can not be self sufficient on that ? 
  yeah , except finland has more similarity in terms of geography and culture with the nordics . 
  estonia could probably make it into nordics if it did n't have the history involving the ussr and all . 
  finnish & estonian language is similar . 
  honesty we just need a excluded area for the nuclear waste to be stored . 
  it could be like renting storage . 
  finland is actually building the worlds first nuclear waste storage facility in a coastal island underground . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository * http://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-nuclear-iduskcn0t121120151112 it could turn up to be a big profit idea , seeing that many world powers such as russia & the us need a place to down their waste in low profile . 
  problem is finland is still reliant on russian gas , and the majority of northern europe relies on russia for uranium for our nuclear power . 
  unless there is a big push for renewable energies , this probably wo n't change . 
  finland could continue to use biowood for its fuel source but it gives off an awful lot of pollution .
