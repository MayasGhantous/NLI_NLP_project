  there are some five thousand us airman in the base , along with around seven hundred royal air force airman . 
  the germans also occasionally use the base . 
  * good luck getting through that without trigger early warning * good luck fighting 2 + nuclear states, 
  pretty sure there are some * five thousand us airman * in the base along with * seven hundred royal air force airman * in the base . 
  plus some marines guarding the base . 
  seeing that turkey could barely organize a military coup with their land forces and air force good luck getting to the nuclear weapons without some serious resistance and early warning . 
  erdogan is more like cersei lannister . 
  ~ ~ willing to blow up an entire portion of her city with wild fire to get rid of pesky opposition . ~ ~ ( got season 6 ), 
  thats debatable , seeing that israel has palestinian related violence against idf on a daily basis . 
  parallel societies is not a good way to proceed . 
  do n't think reservists are going to do much . 
  it was poorly done , after the momentum of suprise ran out many soldiers just surrendered to police or deserted when they realize how little support they had . 
  if you look at the videos/pictures you can see the majority of soldiers barely have adequate combat gear such as body armor , bags , etc. 
  the army did not seem that prepared . 
  the majority of them just had their normal army fatigues , but no combat gear . 
  and many of them got separated and arrested by police officers , i do n't know what they were thinking . 
  so , from what i read from previous turkish coups . 
  the military pretty much `` restores the constitution '' when the political elite in turkey gain too much power . 
  so they pretty much overthrow the current government and try to call for new elections . 
  jesus christ , helicopter shot down by jet . 
  apparently 17 police officers have been killed by turkish military helicopters, 
  holy shit donald trump tweeted that turks are `` taking back their country '' why, 
  who is trying to coup the government in the military ? 
  is it a secular group or a more islamic group ? 
  erdogan seeking aslyum in germany . 
  jesus christ the irony . 
  come on turkey you 're our best shot for a secular islam democracy in the middle east, 
  yes , but it becomes a problem when those peacekeepers continue to attack georgian forces in georgia after they left south ossetia . 
  the whole reason they attacked on that day is because separatists were shelling georgian villages . 
  after georgia announced it had pulled all forces out of south ossetia , russia said it would stop attacking too , but instead they used their navy to blockade georgia , and did airstrikes within the heart of georgia and did an actual military invasion of georgia . 
  russia 's whole de facto claim for invading georgia was to `` protect russian citizens '' which was pretty easy to compare to their same excuse in crimea . 
  the issue was clearly just between georgia and south ossetia . 
  russia did not need to get involved . 
  but when ossetia separatists started attacking georgian towns , and georgian forces attacked south ossetia in retaliation russia had no justification for an entire military campaign against georgia , invading georgian territory no where near ossetia . 
  russia has a right to defend its peacekeepers , but again , using it as an excuse for an entire military invasion is unfair and unjustifiable . 
  its the exact same thing that happened in crimea . 
  ironically the majority of people on yt comments of political videos or more or less likely conspiracy theories looking for things to justify their stance . 
  and on august 10th , georgian troops left south ossetia , but russia kept on continuing . 
  not sure that georgia started it , they were protecting their break away region , and only started engaging south ossetia after separatists [ started attacking georgian towns . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_russo-georgian_war ) and russia used the full force of its military to destabilize georgia with `` peacekeepers '' at first it was just the georgian government and the separatist territory , but it was russia that actually did a full scale invasion under `` preemptive strike '' to georgia . 
  sorry , i meant the [ commonwealth of independent states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_independent_states ) russia was planning on ukraine to be apart of the [ enlargement of the eeu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_eurasian_economic_union, 
  well , finland and the baltics * were * apart of the russian empire until we got our independence in 1917 . 
  you need to remember , right at the end of the russian empire , the ussr replaced it ( basically a de facto reinvention of it ) so finland was apart of the russian empire , but we got our actual independence peacefully and signed off by lenin . 
  before finland was apart of the swedish empire before sweden lost the territory to russia in a war . 
  there are still many people in russia who hold the idea of a `` eurasia sphere '' and no doubt finland is apart of that because of our distant history . 
  as far as i know only one of the four [ political parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_democratic_party_of_russia ) has an agenda of reincorporating `` lost territory '' , including finland into the [ `` greater russia '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_russia ), 
  well * not in the near future . 
  * and definitely not right after putin is not leading russia . 
  it would be a waste of a good cult of personality . 
  no doubt the rebels would of lasted as long as they did without russian support . 
  there is bilateral cooperation on a military stage , but its all on paper . 
  its not like a real alliance like nato . 
  i think you are referring to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_security_and_defence_policy ) all that does is set up organizations for `` multilateral defense cooperation '' so everything nonbinding . 
  in all honesty i think everyone in the west is waiting for putin to die of old age . 
  sadly i doubt there would be a better replacement . 
  we would go from a kgb officer to a ministry of defense ( sergey shoygu ), 
  finland has a longer border with russia than the baltic states combined . 
  nato has very little to offer finland ( and sweden ) even though we are de facto nato members in terms of interoperability . 
  and finnish neutrality for the most part , has excused finland from most of the harassment that russia does to its other nato members . 
  finland retained its independent and was n't annexed like the baltics . 
  the ussr was planning on annexing the whole of finland , that territory was a pretext for war . 
  as the ussr did a [ false flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ) to get out of a nonaggression pact of finland and fulfill its sphere of influence with the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  arguably , from my opinion it was a huge cost . 
  not just in military material and causalities , but the winter war atleast humiliated the ussr to a point , and even opened up avenues for hitler to start planning his attack on the ussr . 
  the whole point or context of the invasion ( according to soviet propaganda ) was to secure leningrad with a buffer zone . 
  that kind of backfired when finland became a co-belligerent with nazi germany to take back lost land in the first war . 
  even though finland did not directly siege leningrad , finland helped cut off soviet supplies and harassed soviet forces in eastern karelia . 
  if anything the wars fought were a pyrrhic victory for the soviets . 
  well , you need to remember , russia ( atleast its economy ) is not fit for the capitalist world today . 
  even china got the memo for capitalism ( even though its state controlled , free market still reigns ) and china is doing pretty decent for itself . 
  the reason russia needs these `` buffers '' is because of the [ failed privatization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/privatization_in_russia ) during the collaspe of the ussr the big budget revenue companies such as the military arms industry and energy industry stayed in state controlled hands . 
  that means whenever the energy industry or arms industry is not doing good it directly effects the federal budget as current low oil prices are . 
  the countries that made up russia 's ussr members are its own personal market , and with the eeu russia can be the dominant force in their market without competition from the west . 
  yep , and russia is using south ossetia the same way as the war of donbas , just start up more rebels to destabilize the region if things do n't go as planned . 
  well , [ failed privatization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/privatization_in_russia ) in russia still haunts it to this day . 
  atleast the baltic states had an actual manual ( eu standards ) for it to privatize the right way . 
  the eu is not directly involved in the ukraine crisis or its combat . 
  russia is however . 
  well , first off finland fought off russia during the second world war in the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) and [ continuation war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) so i guess we were too much of a burden to lose more men over . 
  that and finland had to appear [ `` overly neutral '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) while under soviet union influence during the cold war . 
  i doubt the russian minorities in the baltics would amass and try to join russia . 
  although there are some issues with discrimination in the baltics they know it is much better there , with individual rights , and higher standard of living . 
  definitely not finland . 
  finland is actually one of the most russophobic nations in europe ( nothing to be proud of ) nor do we have a significant russian population . 
  the baltic states in the other hand too , but the standard of living the baltics is alot better than russia , so i doubt they are willing to give that up to join the federation . 
  that and the baltics are apart of nato/eu and finland is apart of eu . 
  its pretty simple , russia did not like that * their * guy was ousted from power , so they took retaliatory measures to stop ukraines accession closer to the western bloc . 
  same thing they did during the russo-georgian war . 
  in the 21st century with russia 's failed liberalization it relies on organizations such as the eeu to stay in the markets of its former ussr members . 
  russia really can not compete economically with the west . 
  thats why it keeps pushing on deals bilaterally with nations or using eeu as a prop up . 
  the shanghai cooperation organization is doing just that . 
  inherently there is n't much value for the eu to expand any further . 
  if there was anything to grab , ukraine would of been it , being the second most powerful member to eeu and close enough to europe to not be totally isolated . 
  i doubt the eu or any other western bloc will get close to the central republics , or belarus . 
  russia wants to keep buffer zones to protect itself . 
  in the 21st century and the failed liberalism policies after the dissolution of the ussr solidifies the view to russia that it can not compete nation to nation with the western world . 
  thats why it rely on organizations such as the eeu to keep a grip on its former ussr states and keep access to their markets . 
  eh , it was expected , with the russo-georgian war in 2008 , and now the war in donbas , russia * clearly * does not like its former satellite states from drifting away of its natural buffer . 
  a country like russia can not survive in a fta world dominated by western countries , thats why it relies on its organizations such as eeu that solidify its rule and keep markets open to benefit russia .
