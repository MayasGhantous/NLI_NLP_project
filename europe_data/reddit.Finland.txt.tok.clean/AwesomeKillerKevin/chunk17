  good knews is since ukraine left , the eeu is basically a hollow shell of russia with ukraine being its second most powerful member . 
  ;( please help us earth take back trump, 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it is still true in russia together , do n't need to look far into the state-run enterprises . 
  russia has n't under taken the major reforms necessary for their market not to be effected by low oil prices . 
  dude who are you kidding , the russian economy is still in ruins . 
  you realize that russia-chinese trade has actually been [ declining ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russian-chinese-trade-plummets-in-2015/555632.html ) since the 2014 sanctions . 
  russia needs china more than china needs russia . 
  you ca n't sustain trade on just military technology and nonrenewable energy . 
  russia is only china 's [ 9th biggest trading partner . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_china ) the russian ruble has been decreasing in value , russia has already cut its own social insurance funds and it has ** not ** been investing . 
  it has scrapped many of its projects , such as future oil exploration due to the crisis , even russia 's military modernization has been cut short . 
  i do n't see how this crisis created jobs , seeing that the eu is russia 's # 1 market , many russian companies are n't firing personnel because the federal government said to , but instead they are either cutting wages or withholding pay all together . 
  it concerns the eu when many of these nations are trying to seek eu membership . 
  in the west , money gets you power . 
  in russia , power gets you money . 
  i agree , you should n't just try to block out voices , but rather confront them on their bs . 
  some groups in the baltic are already doing what you are proposing , there 's a group called the [ `` baltic elves . 
  '' ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/20/the-baltic-elves-taking-on-pro-russian-trolls.html ) they are basically unpaid volunteer who just try confronting all the russian propaganda aimed at causing ethnic tensions in eastern europe . 
  if we could honestly have more of these that would be nice , but having an entire eu bureau over it makes it seem like a `` propaganda '' department itself . 
  i always thought there was something sketchy about the globalresearch site , never understood how one site could be so anti-globalization yet have it in their name . 
  not really sure if there 's any way to counter it without restricting media freedoms . 
  probably the best thing the west can do is keep showing what makes our society so great in the first place , and to blatantly call out falsehoods from the other side . 
  it was a little funny seeing rt hosts quitting live on air during the ukrainian crisis , i only remember two , not sure if there was any . 
  the problem with the propaganda techniques that russia uses is that russia 's propaganda outlets do n't have to necessarily push false information to convince our citizens , they just have to convince our domestic media . 
  during the whole mh17 incident , media had to try to appear ` balanced ' even if that meant on reporting russian claims that may have been totally fabricated . 
  the [ vast majority of countries were against russia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_reactions_to_the_annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation ) not even china , belarus , or any of russia 's close allies came in to support it . 
  yet they were able to * convince * our media to spew their propaganda out . 
  [ barely any countries recognize crimea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea ), 
  the fact of the matter rt news and all those other channels only appeal to a certain group of people . 
  those people are your nwo believers , religious armageddon , anti-semanticists , and other conspiracy believers who have some notion of russian romanticism . 
  that itself is not a problem , but it becomes a problem with foriegn propoganda outlets such as rt , push so much white buzz and false information in the media sphere that traditional media in our own countries have to `` present both sides of the argument '' even if its entirely incompetent and false . 
  i remember during the mh17 incident russia changed it story 2-3 times within a week , first saying ukrainian air defenses shot down the jet , later saying ukrainian jets , and it was just a mess . 
  during the 1991 coup attempt many russians did try to listen to cnn , as they were really the only outlet reporting on the incident . 
  cnn is banned in russia now , but you can still get rt on your cable channel in the west , fml . 
  russia 's foriegn oriented media outlets really only appeal to a small section of society . 
  usually people who are already prone to outlets like rt , alex jones , and all these other conspiracy outlets can not really change their mind when faced with the facts . 
  by just looking at the comment sections of these websites its just flooded with anti-westernism , sprouts about a ` new world order ' , antisemitism and some romanticism of the ussr . 
  but really this does n't become a problem if our own citizens watch this stuff , it becomes a problem when the media of the host trys ` balancing ' everything in international politics even if its direct propaganda or just pure story . 
  for example during the ukraine crisis and mh17 . 
  there was overwhelming of evidence , and [ support ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_reactions_to_the_annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation ) to ukraine , but all of the russian buzz filled information causes our media to have to ` consider ' the other side even if its not backed up by evidence . 
  i ca n't remember how many times media switched from saying that first it was `` ukrainian air defenses '' that shot down the plane , then they switched to cia agents , and then they switched again to ukrainian jets . 
  its ridiculous really . 
  yeah i was about to reply about that . 
  even though switzerland is `` neutral '' the vast majority of its advanced military equipment like mbt come from germany , and aircraft come from the us . 
  problem is though , apcs are pretty simple to make , and its usually a big ticket item for arms manufacturers back . 
  virtually every european country has the capability and profit drive to make their own apcs ( see list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_armoured_fighting_vehicles ) with still one apc design , countries would rather make their own , and benefit from more jobs . 
  i think apcs are one of those diverse military equipments like firearms that countries can afford to make their own . 
  its not like the f-16 / f-18 fa jet or leopard 2 mbt that is in such high demand and requires special military knowledge ( from countries such as the us and germany ) to manufacture . 
  i also assume pride has quiet a lot to do with it . 
  even though the majority of european countries use either the german hk416 or g3 variant for their firearms styles , or they still use the old soviet 7.62 models . 
  countries such as france & the uk have too much national pride , so they would rather build their own domestic military equipment even if its at a high price . 
  the problem is of course is that a large portion of eu military equipment is supplied by the us . 
  whether it be air defenses , vehicles , communication systems , and aircraft . 
  projects such as the leopard 2 are a great hit for cross-national defense use , virtually every eu country uses that as their mbt or a variant of that . 
  the us has the resources and the military complex available to mass produce those types of weapons cheaper than every eu country individually making their own firearms and vehicles . 
  eh , to be * fair * countries like poland , and the baltics ask for us forces . 
  and alot of eu military equipment and logistics is handled by the us . 
  even neutral switzerland mainly relies on eu countries for its military ground vehicles . 
  and is nearly completely reliant ( except for trainers ) for the us in combat aircraft . 
  there are really only a few european countries that manufacture their own military jets , uk , france , germany , sweden, 
  eu population : 508.2 million ( january 2015 ) , us population 321 million . 
  i would be surprised if the us had an bigger military than the eu . 
  but that being said , the us has ** many ** more foriegn bases over than the eu combined . 
  still concerning how much weaponry , even for basic thing such as firearms and transport vehicles that the eu depends on for its military . 
  better now than later . 
  if ukraine truly wants to be apart of the `` west '' as the baltics have become they need to keep moving before everyone loses sight of what this maidan revolution was all about . 
  the british empire needs to defend itself somehow . 
  not to mention all of them would be blond , middle age women ... theresa is blond is n't she ? 
   so all that uproar during the referendum about an unelected eu president and now we ended up with a prime minister who , in the end , did n't make it to the last stage for public party members to vote on , but only chosen by mps . 
  the irony . 
  and the great british shitshow continues . 
  haha, 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/22/raf-wont-be-able-to-repair-kit-on-f-35-jets---even-though-it-was/ i think i read somewhere too that the uk will be the electronics hub for the aircraft in europe . 
  yeah , i believe america was in isolationism . 
  i think us military spending reached somewhere like 40 % during ww2 or something . 
  thats still going to take at least half a century minimum , and when the ice in the caps start to melt thats when you actually want to be buying more icebreakers , not less . 
  the ice in the arctic will be alot looser and soft so icebreakers can get through , and not to mention all of the ice debris that you see on a daily basis that start floating away from the north . 
  link me a video . 
  i can not find any information on its export . 
  if it truly was as popular as you said , people would be lining up to buy it . 
  so far i only see rumors about pakistan and nigeria having them . 
  and the articles that do talk about them , say they are less capable and slowler than us versions . 
  and you 're telling [ finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) ;( neutrality only works if in your enemies eyes you are truly neutral . 
  i do n't think turkey is the ` weak link ' per say in the nato alliance . 
  turkey is probably one of the most war mongering and war willing in the alliance . 
  of course having autocratic elements in your government helps . 
  but turkey is highly involved in battling assad and is in the middle east . 
  the only issue is , nato itself was made as an anti-communist anti-russian alliance . 
  the vast majority of european countries do n't worry alot about defense and security , and when they do it solely focuses on russia . 
  while turkey has to deal with extremists near its border for decades . 
  turkey just has a more independent foriegn policy and wants to keep all doors open . 
  i doubt turkey would heavily sacrifice itself for russia , seeing that europe is its main trading partner , and turkey spent years to get into eu customs . 
  as for greece , i do n't think russia can do overwhelmingly much there , russia has an economy the size of spain , it would be a good partner for greece , but hardly a large trading partner . 
  well first off , the baltics and finland are not really similar , finland is a nordic with roots towards sweden . 
  the only commonality finland has with the baltics is estonia , and thats because we are both apart of the finno-urgic language group . 
  finland is not apart of nato while the baltics are . 
  in the eastern european view ( again finland , is not eastern european ) for centuries they 've been basically cannon fodders for opposing sides . 
  western european countries ever since wwii have had a poor record of protecting their allies on the east . 
  they would rather remain neutral and be provocative towards russia than risk confrontation and the possibility of western european countries just not helping .
