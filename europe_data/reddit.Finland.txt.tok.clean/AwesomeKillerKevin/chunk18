  a poll came out that said a majority of germans did n't want germany to help if another nato country was attacked . 
  as far as integrated , they are as integrated as they can get . 
  at this current point in europe there is a mass hysteria of anti-eu establishment . 
  an `` eu army '' would hardly be good press . 
  even so european countries are highly integrated and have high interoperability , even finland and sweden which are non-nato members have alot of nato equipment , and follow nato air defense and communications structures . 
  the military equipment in european countries is also highly integrated . 
  the vast majority of european countries use germans leopard as their mbt and the majority if not all european countries use the us 's air fighters for defense . 
  pls not another ribbentrop - molotov pact ;(, 
  little concerning that greece ( a nato member ) signed a defense manufacturing contract with russia . 
  also concerning that turkey ( a ~ ~ external border from the islamists ~ ~ big nato member ) is all of a sudden lightening up relations with russia . 
  again , % of gdp is misleading . 
  russia has an economy the size of spain , its in recession , and their % of gdp spending on their military is around 5.4 % , compared to countries like the uk and france that healthily outspend russia while keeping around 1.5 % -2 % gdp spending . 
  russia does not have a tiny budget . 
  russia 's military spending % of gdp is around 5.4 % . 
  that is a lot considering russia is going through an economic crisis , and russia barely has any soft power influence to show for it . 
  taking land from ukraine is n't really a big accomplishment , russia can basically take out any of its former ussr member foes , western countries is another thing . 
  why do you say afghanistan , iraq are failed wars ? 
  they are ongoing , and they have pro-us governments which is a goal i suppose . 
  as for china i can not speak for their reaper . 
   you can get a lot more for your money if you 're buying from china . 
  that statement holds like no ... factual value , china does n't have a very big arms exporting market , its only real market partners are pakistan , and i have not heard of china 's reaper drone , it has n't been exported yet besides being operational since 2008 . 
  of course the backbone of nato is the united states , if the us acts then surely the mass majority if not all nato members will be involved , if not there would be alot of awful scolding going around , and the us has left allies in the past that did n't pull their weight . 
  * cyprus is divided into greek and turkish districts , and the island is demilitarized by the un , however greece and turkey spend alot on their militaries * malta again , is a small city-state like nation which does have a sizable navy for its size , it holds absolutely no threat to any nation considering its population and lack of geopolitical value . 
  * austria is wedged just like switzerland with friendly states , its in the interior of the eu , but they do still have conscription * sweden during the cold war actually was n't really `` neutral '' , it seeked security guarantees with the us and let the us use its waters for nuclear submarines . 
  according to polls more swedes are in favor of nato than opposing it , and its a major issue in sweden considering all these so called russian submarine incidents . 
  in all honesty though , 3.5 % of gdp for the us is historically low and a pretty good bang for its buck . 
  the us is a global military entity with the largest arms exports , over 100s of military bases ( no other country even reaches 12 abroad ) , and of course its military-industrial complex means its always on the leading edge of military technology . 
  then you have countries like saudi arabia ( 10.3 % ) and israel ( 5.4 % ) that have to spend alot of money on their defense , most of it being imported arms , to only defend their region . 
  even russia is spending a crippling 5.4 % of its gdp on military spending durings it economic crisis . 
  i assume its just to keep russia in check . 
  but any catastrophic incident that happens in the west , is scene as a failure to the united states because you guys are the * leader of the free world . 
  * i 'm also on ** how much ** us military equipment makes up europe 's armed forces . 
  france , uk , germany even have significant portions of us military technology from submarines , jets , to artillery systems . 
  even `` neutral '' switzerland buys a buttload of us f-18 jets . 
  i read somewhere too that europe is also used as a staging ground for your missions in the middle east , such as medical hospitals in germany and drone bases . 
  the united states has alot of security agreements , from australia , nz , to saudi arabia , and israel . 
  most of the treaties from the cold war era i believe . 
  if i recall the baltics operate a joint naval task force together . 
  the best the baltics can do , is to prepare for non-conventional warfare tactics , such as investing in cyber security and improve energy security . 
  in a conventional scenario , the baltic states lack strategic depth and have no natural barriers to fend off an invasion , but its still important for these countries to be able to defend at least from russian asymmetrical warfare tactics so they do n't get overthrown with no direct action russian involvement . 
  well , i 'm not north american , but canada can supplement america 's role in specializing in arctic warfare . 
  if i recall the us only has 2 icebreakers ( decades old ) and russia has over 60 ( 2 of them nuclear ) . 
  so maybe canada can just get an arctic fleet of icebreakers ? 
  or you can buy them from finland  ( we make 60 % of the worlds icebreakers ), 
  % of gdp again is misleading , especially if a country at 1.0 % gdp can outspend a military power at 3.0 % . 
  i would n't really expect much action from greece seeing that they are warming up to russia in terms of producing military equipment together . 
  can not really blame them in their own situation . 
  there are advantages to being america 's top hat . 
  my guess is greece is still all militarized up from the dispute with turkey over the cyprus . 
  guess canada has its own advantages being america 's top hat in defense . . 
  in soviet cold war planning , the ussr basically had switzerland in line as the same as other nato members . 
  the problem with the baltic countries is geographically they hold no strategic depth to hold off an invasion , and have no natural barriers . 
  probably the best the baltic countries can do is beef their defenses up , especially in cyber security and energy security so russia ca n't destabilize the country without actual military invasion . 
  out of all countries greece is sticking to its budget ~ ~ for once ~ ~ haha probably because of relations with turkey over cyprus . 
  i do n't know what trump says is right or wrong . 
  this dude went bankrupted 4 times within a decade , was a vietnam draft dodger , and overall is very sketchy , some of his foriegn policy advisors have pro-russian tones to it too . 
  she is * literally * the us government . 
  in all honesty though , as long as the next us president maintains all of their security guarantees in europe everyone is going to be happy as fuck . 
  obama at least pretended to take care of some issues in europe . 
  for the rest of the world , of course predictable us foreign policy is important . 
  hillary clinton is the most establishment politician in the us , but no she has the most experience in foreign policy in the us than anyone else really . 
  ( for better or worse ) . 
  all europe is worrying about from the us now is that the us will continue its security guarantees with the western europe . 
  some austrailian newspaper were already getting jumpy when trump wanted to disband all ( including nato ) us defense alliances . 
  very few eu countries seem very cozy with russia , atleast not in eastern europe . 
  problem is most of europe has been relying on the us ( nato ) since the end of wwii to this modern day . 
  the european military structure is basically still designed off nato cold war plans , many of the same bases , equipment , and command structures remain the same . 
  heck , even the uk still hosts several us air force bases , instead of fighting nazi germany or preparing for a ussr invasion they 're used for training and air bases for bombing runs in the middle east . 
  at this point in time the majority of europe is in an anti-eu integration fever . 
  another issue is that very few eu members have the capability to mass produce 90 % or more of their own equipment . 
  even the military heavy weights in europe , such as the uk , france , germany , italy , etc require important us technologies ( uk relies on the us for their uranium and repair for their nuclear submarine , and will be required to repair their new f-35 's in the us since the us is the only one who knows how to work the expensive brittle plane ) . 
  and even so , its much more cheaper to buy military equipment from the us ( who has n't stopped mass producing armaments since wwii ) than to spend extra money on your own technologies . 
  the french fighter dassault rafale probably has the same interoperability and capabilities as the mass produced f-16 / f-18 class fighters , but its much more expensive , since its really only used domestically in france . 
  france 's national front has gotten loans from russian banks , thats been confirmed i believe . 
  its not going to destroy the german market , its going to hurt the uk car market more than germanys , and either way there will still be trade , there might be tariffs or more barriers but it will carry on nonetheless . 
  even though that while the uk is a key partner with germany in terms of trade , it is not the most important , and ensuring trade with the uk long-term is not the country 's most important goal . 
  the goal is to keep the eu together and preserve the single market , if the entire single market collapses its much worse off for the car industry than just the uk leaving . 
  if germany had to choose between protecting a market , which absorbs 50 % of its exports ( ie , the euxuk ) and is thereby a 6.7 times bigger export market than the uk , it seems obvious where the long-term strategic economics preferences may be . '', 
  i think the majority of the western world would rather have clinton than trump , seeing that trump actively is fine with dismantling us security relationships and wants a `` good relationship '' with russia . 
  atleast with clinton , in european eyes , she will maintain us security guarantees which nearly every western country is apart of or benefits from either way . 
  either way , its going to be interesting to see three short hair , middle age , blond women controlling international politics . 
  ( uk , us , germany ), 
  * but ... but ... but ... who will b-buy ... german cars ? 
  * the german car industry will be fine , i think its the [ uk car industry ] ( http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/brexit-could-harm-uk-car-industry-growth ) you should be worried about . 
  to be fair , the us is at least in a position to brag about such things , the uk not so much . 
  with the uk leaving the eu i believe the us tops as the worlds # 1 economy now ? 
  i just love how germany and france are just like ... ** nope **, 
  man , i wonder if [ christian science monitor ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/ ) has a bias of any kind , can anyone help me ? 
  here 's a better video from rt if anyone wants to see . 
  the embassy guard decks him [ within 6 seconds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dbrlnke13k ) of leaving the taxi . 
  the embassy guard just decked him [ within 6 seconds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dbrlnke13k ) of leaving the taxi . 
  i do n't see how people are placing fault on the alleged diplomat, 
  it was obviously planned before hand by the guard . 
  the whole incident took place [ within 6 seconds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dbrlnke13k ) of him leaving the taxi . 
  i got to admit , it was a bit humorous when the taxi driver just took off out of there . 
  how does it show his intent of slipping past the guard ? 
  the embassy guard jumped on him the second he left the taxi . 
  and you can see from the video the dude was approaching the embassy box when he got jumped . 
  the whole incident * takes place within 6 seconds . 
  * i do n't know about you but i think the embassy guard clearly planned this before hand .
