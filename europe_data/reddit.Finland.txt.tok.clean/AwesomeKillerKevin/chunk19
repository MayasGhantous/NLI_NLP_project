  here 's the video from rt. 
  the whole incident takes place within 6 seconds . 
  dude , the embassy guard jumped on the guy within a second of him leaving the taxi . 
  i do n't think the diplomat was hiding anything , he was approaching the guard box when the door flung open . 
  the only thing sex segregation does is encourage more pederasty which is already riff in the middle east . 
  the article was confusing . 
  did she lie about being sexual assaulted ? 
  or did she lie about the ethnicity of the people who assaulted her ? 
  seems to me the uk really did jump off the bridge with america on this one . 
  in all honesty though belarus is a better neighbor to the west than russia is currently . 
  belarus is inevitably stuck in the russian sphere of influence and dependent on them for economic reasons , but lukashanko has successfully fought off russian requests to place an airfield in belarus , now ** that ** would be a serious problem . 
  as far as i know russia just has a feel radar detention bases in belarus . 
  if you are an everyday citizen i doubt anyone would care , if you said it and your in the media thats a whole different story . 
  russia is just trying to protect its sphere of influence . 
  however i believe in the 21st century elected countries should be able to join whoever the fuck they want . 
  russia did n't like that georgia and ukraine were having more democratic ideals . 
  you need to realize that after the collapse of the ussr , from the russian perspective they were humiliated , especially after the failed `` liberal '' reforms that put most of the countries wealth in a few cronies . 
  russia has an economy around the size of spain , its not longer an economic giant , it has to rely on political repercussions and military power . 
  although russia has a wanning influence in eastern europe , the central asia republics are clusterfucked being between china and russia who are trying to practice regime stability . 
  uk , france , germany would more or less likely do something . 
  if its a threat to the eu then germany will have no choice to act . 
  finland was neutral in the beginning of wwii too - did n't exactly go as planned , since russia kept demanding things . 
  maybe in putins eye finland is still apart of the agreement of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance . 
  better get ready !, 
  those swedes may attack any day now !, 
  i was referring to finland & sri lanka with the ppp/nominal not russia but ok . 
  i do n't really believe there will be any lightening of sanctions , unless france or italy are in turmoil to the point of lifting them . 
  very interesting , thank you for sharing that . 
  even by using ppp , gdp per capita in finland is $ 40,000 and sri lanka is around $ 3,800 . 
  just reverse that by multiplying by the countries population ( finland is 5.5 mil and sri lanka is 20 mil ) finland still outpaces sri lanka by a significant mount , still making my case . 
  most likely , us spends about 3.5 % but it has hundreds of military bases and security guarantees with other countries . 
  5.4 % alone barely matches russia with a defense spending of the uk or france which spend only half of that ( 1.9 % -2.1 % ), 
   ppp is the best estimate of how much actual goods/services get produced and consumed in the country per year we are not measuring how much gets produced/consumed in a country . 
  we are ** comparing ** countries , there you need to use nominal so the currency exchanges . 
  and as the other person said , ppp inflates poorer countries , its not good for comparison . 
  do you honestly think sri lanka has the economy size of finland ? 
  actually no it does n't . 
  gdp ** nominal ** finland has a gdp of [ $ 276 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_finland ) while sri lanka has a gdp ** nominal ** of [ $ 80 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sri_lanka ) ppp is only good for measuring how much of a countries own currency is worth in its own country . 
  while nominal is used when comparing international currency exchanges . 
  for example , how much $ 1 us dollar can buy in china compared to china 's own rmb currency . 
  plus finland has a population of 5.5 million with a gdp/capita of $ 40,000 while sri lanka has a population of over 20 million with a gdp/capita of only $ 3,818 . 
  the * point * i was alluding to is in the grand scheme of things , russia is not all that powerful as many people stereotypical think it is . 
  russia does have capable military but by compared to other countries such as france , uk , and germany they outspend russia on their defense anywhere between $ 8-12 billion . 
  the uk and france spend around 2.0 % of their gdp on defense , while russia is currently spending around 5.4 % . 
  point being russia 's defense budget is nearly twice of that of western european countries and barely matches their defense spending output or are behind still $ 8-12 billion . 
  i suppose so , during ` finlandization ' the politicians prepared for a war with the west while the army officials [ drafted plans and espionage ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/12/finland-and-american-intelligence ) to counter the soviet union . 
  the western world should just play the waiting game , just build up military capability in eastern europe as necessary , keep dialogue open , and just wait . 
  today russia already announced it went through 1 of its 2 sovereign funds used for reserves . 
  no need to fight when you can wait for an economy the size of spain to slowly dwindle its military capability or hunger . 
  russia has an economy the size of spain . 
  i think people are honesty overestimating russia 's military capability , in its actions in the 2008 georgian-russo war , and the war in donbass , russia could only use limited amount of military force and relied on separatists for the grunt of their fighting . 
  russia 's modernization program has been stagnant since sanctions , only around 30 % of its military has `` modernized '' equipment that it set out to get around 70 % . 
  i doubt russia would even have the gepolitical goal of invading the baltics . 
  what help would that get ? 
  the baltics themselves are hard to defend , open plains with no geographic barriers , next to a nato body of water , if you are comparing sheer military force , russia will run out pretty quickly compared to europe . 
  france and the uk have a military budget around 8-10 $ billion surplus individually bigger than russia . 
  and in a theoretical war situation in the baltics , nato could easily reinforce the area , as denmark ( a nato member ) is the gatekeeper geographically to the baltic sea . 
  russia will have a hard time bringing its naval forces and other assets near the caucasian region to reinforce the baltics . 
  the main backbone of nato is the us , if the us acts then the rest of europe will follow suit . 
  russia is a major economy for the eastern european countries , but it is [ not an economic giant , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) ) it as an economy around the size of spain . 
  in all honesty though , i think you can agree sweden-finnish defense relations are pretty shallow . 
  in sweden 's view finland is more of a risk if russia tries to plan anything against finland , sweden would rather stick to its exclusive security guarantees with the usa as they did in the cold war . 
  but yeah , perhaps sweden/finland could somehow negotiate a defense treaty or something that the us has with australia/nz . 
  well everything news related is directed to the domestic audience of course . 
  russia is going through its reserves pretty fast , pretty sure i read a ny article on how russia is already finished with one of its two sovereign funds reserves . 
  well that finnish representative was the president , and if you saw the interview not at all you 'd think it was a weak performance . 
  he at least got putin on board to turning aircraft respondents on while in the baltic sea . 
  ( whether that will work or not ) and he specifically said finland was apart of the team that did the sanctions on russia ( while putin was going on a rant on finland would be better if it followed `` londons example '' of brexit . ), 
  russian president and finnish pm had a meeting in finland a couple days ago , it was suppose to be a `` dialogue '' meeting to talk about issues such as the baltic sea , syria , and ukraine crisis . 
  vladimir putin brought up 3 times how he has `` pulled back '' troops 1,500 km from the finnish border . 
  even considering this is false , 1,500 km is basically from the finnish border to the ural mountains . 
  [ ( yle english verision ) ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/putins_comment_about_location_of_russian_troops_baffles/9000152 ) its a little tiring hearing putin threaten finland over joining nato . 
  finland has to rely on a lot of dialogue these days to keep the baltic sea from being another warzone , but thats probably more or less because they share over a 1,300 km border with russia and are not apart of nato . 
  in all honesty `` dying wishes '' are stupid . 
  if you really cared so much you would do their last wishes before they die so they can actually see the results for themselves . 
  last wishes seem to be more of a burden on the living than a reward for the soon-to-be dead . 
  this is pretty freaky i have to admit , but in all honesty is it the best choice for a 60 year old to carry a baby ? 
  jade helm 15 is real you see !, 
  its gdp per capita , its a pretty unreliable statistic , especially in places where there is growing wealth inequality ( like the united states ) all yer billionaires are gon na push the median up . 
  no , in texas the immigrants go to more liberal places like california otherwise they would be called ~ ~ an obama plot to take away our guns and establish the muslim brotherhood state ~ ~ rapist and criminals, 
  russia is pretty right wing , at least the `` united russia '' party and the putinism complex . 
  right wing is basically on the scale of authoritarianism and nationalism , the only thing different is instead of free market its state enterprise , but i 'd argue cronyism takes a big toll there . 
  i was not referring to the polish government . . really that was your first guess ? 
  not big neighbor to the east ? 
  well authoritarianism and nationalism usually contemplate those . 
  putin is a very `` popular '' politician . 
  he was leading russia during the oil boom , russia got somewhat modernized , pensions rised , salaries rose incredibly , internet use increased as well , this recent downfall in russia hes painting as `` russia defending russian ideals '' so its unlikely anything specifically will lower his numbers , unless of course russia goes into total chaos . 
  the `` united russia '' party is the dominant party in russia , basically anything gets passed what they say , plus the opposition parties are terribly weak sauce in russia , the only real * opposition * party russia has is the communist party and they really only defend stuff like `` communist ideals '' and pensioners and veterans . 
  other than that ` liberals ' in russia are being jailed left and right . 
  i 'm not going to say its ` normal ' but in the way the media has been working any non-caucasian committing a crime is a big red flag . 
  you were not crystal clear on what you were talking about , you kept interchanging the word * east * making it confusing , you could of simply used the russian empire to differentiate between the two easts i just see on some political threads on / r/suomi you are downvoted alot , especially on putin/russia/ukraine / nato articles . 
  i have n't been on reddit long , and on this specific reddit section for less than a month . 
  finland < 3, 
  * poland stronk !, 
  problem is in this day and age people 's goldfish minds are drenched in entertainment . 
  entertainment in the news , entertainment on social media , entertainment on the tv ... so when they finally find someone interesting ( where it be the donald trumps or nigel farages of the world ) on something as boring as politicians they got ta jump at it . 
   the aid often goes to developing countries that were former u.k. colonies . 
  so some global thinkers say it 's a way of staying connected , of atoning for misdeeds during the colonial period , or of influencing politics today . 
  but maybe it 's more than that . 
  ( 5th stanza ) although i do n't agree with the view , if the uk is * really * going orient itself outside of the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ europe it most likely wo n't cut off its aid unless in dire economic turmoil .
