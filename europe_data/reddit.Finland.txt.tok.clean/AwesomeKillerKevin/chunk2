  russia pretty much still believes eastern european countries , even those in the eu are fair game in its sphere of influence . 
   they absolutely have that right . 
  but we ca n't let people like that set our russia policy . 
  simple as that . 
  we are going to let people like that set our russian democracy . 
  eu is a union of 28 member states , and unanimously all were in favor of sanctioning russia . 
  did you just miss the part where russia attacked and annexed apart of an eastern european country ? 
  one could simply say the same about western or central european countries . 
  you guys may be too busy trying to make a profit or keep stable oil flows from russia in exchange for eastern european security . 
  eastern european countries in the eu have the right to voice their opinions as much as they please as any other country gets too . 
  just because you are cozy away from conventional threats does n't mean you have to neglect others . 
  russia does n't see finland as a threat as long as it does n't bolster ties with nato . 
  finland 's archetype mindset is set around russia being the aggressor . 
  yeah , russia is n't the ` enemy ' today but in a 9/10 chance if finland gets into another war its going to be against russia . 
  who else would invade us ? 
  the swedes ? 
  the f-35 is literally too expensive to buy for the air force . 
  if we managed to find money somewhere , in which we do n't . 
  more over less the money would be spent towards the army or modernizing and equipping the conscription force where it would be of better use . 
  and they are not going to sell us the f-35 , period . 
  the article you linked did n't even specifically say that they were trying to market on finland . 
  finland was n't apart of the f-35 program design stage , nor is it of any real strategic importance or a close ally of the united states . 
  it would actually might be a risk to sell the new 5th generation stealth fighter to finland considering our proximity to the russian border and possible espionage attempts . 
  i would rather buy the next f-18 super hornet over a stealth fighter that does n't fit our doctrine . 
  not to mention the maintenance cost to go along with an expensive fighter like that . 
  our defense strategy is based on suitability , and it would be more useful is we had dozens of multi-role aircraft ready for our defense than just a handful of expensive future generation fighters that are only built for a specific purpose . 
  jesus christ , russia and the us are n't even the main actors , you realize this conflict has been going on well before either the us or russia got involved , iran , saudia arabia have already sailed this boat . 
  source for this ? 
  i know boeing wants to sell the new super hornet to replace our hornet fleet , but finland is n't really in any formal relationship with the us to get an advanced plane as the f-35 , i also doubt that we would buy them due to their cost and limited application for our defense strategy . 
  in all honesty i think india is just buying these jets for either military strength demonstration or for being a crucial sphere for their air force . 
  india is a big importer of military equipment , they buy russian , german , french , british , amercian , israeli , basically foriegn equipment whereever they need without taking care in standardizing anything . 
  when you have 4 different aircraft from 4 different countries maintaining and buying spare parts is going to be expensive unless you are going to let the others collect dust . 
  na man , there just here for a ~ ~ 60 year ~ ~ vacation, 
  may i ask , where is the notion that troops of x country will be commanded by generals of y country . 
  there is no paperwork to suggest that , its just tabloids . 
  the only current paperwork on an `` eu army '' is related to the [ common security and defense policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_security_and_defence_policy ) and nordic battle groups that are still soldiers of x and y country only commanded by officers of x and y. 
  even so , the `` eu army '' is already technically at play and has been already [ successful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_operations_of_the_european_union ), 
  because barack obama is actually from kenya . 
  one word : alcohol, 
  inb4 we are a pretty homogeneous society * nokia master race intensifies *, 
  nordic defense union pls ;(, 
  can anyone explain why belgium seems to be the outlier in western ( geographic ) europe ? 
  because debt pooling in the eu would be a horrible idea . 
  and it was germany who was pushing sanctions on russia on the first place , not trying to pry them away . 
  all countries want to defend their interests in the eu . 
  the new government and poland and hungary have been divergent on the eu agenda in some circumstances . 
  i think the easiest , and most common front you find between the dynamics of the countries inside the eu are the ** pro-eu ** countries and ** euro-skeptic ** countries . 
  generally countries that support further eu integration , and the european project overall such as germany , france , sweden tend to advocate for the eu . 
  on the other hand , the euroskeptic countries that have a mistrust of eu institutions , eu power , and europeanization are countries such as the uk , hungary , poland , etc. 
  euroskeptic countries tend to have a more negative approach on immigration , wanting a more positive relationship with russia , while eu nations at this current moment support helping out in the refugee crisis and maintaining sanctions on russia .

  something to do with affordable housing or ` mixed-income neighborhoods ' , which means that building contractors have to build x amount of housing that can be afforded by people of a lower socioeconomic status . 
  ( richer neighborhoods pay usually more taxes , and therefore have better schools in the area ) source : family in dc, 
  well your governments did ( at least in the beginning ) , should n't of made europe a wholesale market for migrants to come here . 
  we can take some here and there but you should n't of given a giant birthday invitation card for anyone in africa & the middle east . 
  this is coming from sweden ? 
  i agree we should n't give any added benefits besides safety , shelter , and occasional food money . 
  yes because france should turn into a xenophobic nation that wants to build a wall to keep all illegals out . 
  why does n't calais or some lorry companies just hire some full time private security in patrol cars to just protect the trucking lanes ? 
  its gon na cost money , but arguably its cheaper than getting a solution to deport 7,000 people or having a police force there 24/7, 
  why does n't calais or the trucking companies just hire private security in the short term ? 
  it might not be cheap , but if you have a uniformed force in cars just patrolling the roads so migrants to hitch onto trucks that can be a short-term solution . 
  eh , not entirely accurate ; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/iraq-and-syria-how-many-foreign-fighters-are-fighting-for-isil/, 
  the telegraph had something similar to this ; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/iraq-and-syria-how-many-foreign-fighters-are-fighting-for-isil/, 
  how else do you think we survived the russian invasion ? 
  personal space makes for [ excellent infantrymen ] ( http://f.tqn.com/y/militaryhistory/1/w/i/f/-/-/finn_ski_troops.jpg ), 
  its usually non-europeans who referr to finland as ` scandinavian ', 
  occasionally elderly people wander outside during the winter , but thats why we have housing nurses to look after them . 
  woah woah woah , no proxy war in finland . 
  lmao , your only argument is a fringe movement in the 19th century which is basically nonexistent today . 
  paranoia must be so sheeped into the russian mentality . 
  lol , that talks about the 19th century and the russian civil war , nothing about the cia or cold war . 
  even then , both russia and the us tried getting fringe groups in both societies , such as russia trying to influence the communist party of usa, 
  its not humiliation , its basic politics . 
  if eu countries in the southern border have no incentive to keep refugees why would they ? 
  the eu is a much richer country than turkey , its must cheaper , and less political when we work out an agreement for turkey to bear the refugees . 
  whether you like it or not , the un refugee convention is pretty unfair . 
  it gives a big disadvantage for countries near the mediterranean sea , near unstable countries , while northern europeans basically have nothing to work about it . 
  lets not forget that the eu is turkey 's biggest economic market , and turkey still wants eu accession and visa 's , and thats what we are using as a carrot over their heads . 
   in absolute terms , our economies have practically stagnated . 
  in relative terms , our economies have lost significance compared to other economies such as china 's , brazil 's , india 's , et cetera . 
  indeed , by the time the year 2000 rolled around , the world had gone from an ` american-european axis ' trade model to a ` triangular american-european-asian ' trade model . 
  do you care to elaborate ? 
  you realize developing nations usually always have a higher gdp growth , privatization , and investment boost compared to developed nations . 
  its certainly not going to last long , that being said of developing countries ** ever ** even get into a position to switch from a manufacturing based economy to a consumerism based one . 
  western countries completely outrank countries like china and russia in terms of gdp per capita . 
  china and india will probably never match western countries in standard of living due to their incredible population size and the resources at their disposal . 
  that being said , western countries [ basically own all of the resources ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712 ) in the world and use them for consumption in our economy . 
  the united states has less than 5 % of the global population , yet they use nearly 25 % of the worlds nonrenewable energy . 
  the standard of living in other rich western countries have only increased , not diminished . 
   the people who have for the last three thousand years developed western culture are dying out . 
  the only european or european-descended countries with fertility rates high enough to sustain the current population are argentina and kosovo . 
  all other ` western ' countries have negative natural population growth , while at the same time the countries around ` western ' countries are growing quickly . 
  as a result , as a sort of natural rule of human history , these people will resettle former ` western ' lands and forever extinguish ` western ' cultures in favour of their own cultures . 
  really need to stop this alt-right islamic colonization crap . 
  western european countries have dominated politically , economically , militarily , and culturally every other hemisphere in the world . 
  that is n't going to simply change due to a different birth rate . 
  the british empire was able to rule a big portion of the world 's population and not get drowned down by their fertility . 
  western culture certainly is not dying , the western world still remains the hub for technological advancements , language such as english , and international trade . 
  there is certainly no evidence that the ` other cultures ' are accelerating at a pace that is beating us .
