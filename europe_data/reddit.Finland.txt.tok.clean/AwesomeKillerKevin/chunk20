  the un is separate from the eu so i do n't see how those activities will affect it , the uk needs more international allies better now than before . 
  ceta probably wo n't cover the financial sectors in the uk . 
  so what london * has now * probably wo n't happen under that agreement . 
  the four pillars of the single market is * free movement of people , goods , services , and capital * i doubt the eu would let the uk get off the hook so easily now . 
  the uk can not run itself on a singapore or hong kong model , * just * being a financial center wo n't be enough for the 65 million brits, 
  seeing that the leading figure in the tory campaign says the uk does n't need it your wish might become true . 
  i did n't know the uk had a * cooperation * tax ? 
  god i really hope trump does n't get elected ... thanks for making the impossible possible britain !, 
  it was probably better than the baltic states choose to re-allign themselves with the eu ( and better extent nato ) after the dissolution of the soviet union and the independence of the republics , you could see easily that newly republics that did n't have many other allies quickly fell back into the ~ ~ soviet ~ ~ russian sphere of influence . 
  ( i.e central asian republics are dominated politically , economically , and militarily by russia , and the caucasian states are n't doing much better ) i 'm glad finland helped sponsor you guys into the eu , 
  you need to clarify more carefully , you were talking about the * east * in the sense of the direction , then again * east * in the sense of the modern russian state . 
  it was the finnish senate that declared `` independence '' it was just the bolshevik government that confirmed it at the time . 
  and what i stated before was not wrong , finland today itself is a pretty homogeneous society ( compared to other western societies atleast , maybe not iceland ) and finland did * almost * loose its independence during the 20th century , you could argue we lost some of our independent during the `` finlandization '' although i do n't really agree with that term . 
  also , if you do n't mind me asking , why are you so disliked on / r/suomi ? 
  i do n't mean those who released , i mean the ones in the article by which some witnesses claim their ethnicity , but yes nothing has been confirmed yet . 
  they * obviously * must have skill since the police have n't been able to identity them yet . 
  when the police hold back the identity its a pretty big hint its aslyum seekers . 
  the patterns described in the incident are similar to other cases . 
  no no they work , ** the letters are n't big enough ** to read . 
  so was this done by aslyum seekers or just creepy people from the local population . 
  when the swedish police most likely hold back the identify , thats a pretty big hint it was aslyum seekers . 
  jesus , we have this to deal with and now the incident in tampere . . 
  nice username . . 
  oh come on , you have to * atleast * admit that sanctions and falling oil prices are a big cause of russia 's downturn . 
  even so , sanctions make it harder for russia to continue developing more oil drilling projects , and oil is the life line of the kremlin budget . 
  also , does belarus trade with any other country besides russia ? 
  poland or ukraine i suppose ? 
  what do you mean by * east ? 
  * do you mean the finno-urgic speaking populations ( originating from northern eurasia ) where the ancestry of the finnish population came from ? 
  or do you mean ethnic russians at the time when finland was under the grand duchy ? 
  even so ethnic * finns * and ethnic * russians * are pretty different besides the karelians and vepsians , both of which are becoming fewer and fewer . 
  we did gain our independence after gaining approval from the bolshevist government under lenin . 
  although i would add not soon after during the finnish civil war lenin and joseph stalin amoung others , under the threat of petrograd , supported the reds and social democrats to seize power in finland . 
  russian troops also participated against finnish whites , however few in number . 
  even so i do n't think soviet russia really considered finland ` independent ' at the time until under pressure of the brest-litovsk negotiations they decided that finland did n't have the cost-benefit geopolitically for more support for the reds cause . 
  having a * lose if you do n't defend it * is a pretty mellow way of looking at it , do you honestly think lenin or anyone else within the soviet inner circle let the former parts of the empire go out of pure morality ? 
  more or less in finland 's case it was a battle not worth fighting for , nevertheless they did n't wish to commit to . 
  if we would have an inclusive nordic language it would most likely be ~ ~ arabic ~ ~ swedish . 
  you realize that belarus feels the pain just as much , even * more * in some instances with moscows foriegn policy shenanigans . 
  its really putting a damp on lukashenko 's * `` neutrality '' *, 
  finland should honestly keep using nato a blackmail for stability in the baltic sea . 
  as long as finland-sweden agree to consult one another before any ` hasty ' foriegn policy moments we should be fine . 
  finland has several multiple mobile rocket launch systems that could hit st. petersburg from south karelia for further ` deterrence ', 
  it is a bit frustrating when france and germany ( steinmeier ) are having doubts , considering they were the main components of these sanctions . 
  it is a bit frustrating when you have countries like france and germany ( steinmeier ) flip floping on these issues . 
  especially when its us on russia 's western border that feels most of the pain . 
  finland nearly gets all of its natural gas and oil exports from russia , we do n't really have much of a choice . 
  the pipeline itself does not affect finland 's natural gas supply , so it would be stupid for us to dispute something that a ) does n't effect our supply b ) would cause a confrontation and dispute , and as said earlier , finland gets 100 % of its natural gas from russia . 
  this whole thing could be stopped fairly easily , if your foreign minister did n't agree to it . 
  ( its germany that russia is looking to supply with this pipe , not any scandinavian countries . ), 
  we * nearly * lost our independence from the east . 
  suomi is a pretty homogeneous country , there are n't that many karelians nowdays ( living in finland or russia ) so i do n't see how half our countrymen came from the east . 
  here is a video : https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/teaching-world-war-ii, 
  when is the nb8 happening ? 
  ( nordics + baltics ), 
  oh god a trump presidency ... to be fair to the ` leave ' campaign , they did n't expect to win , so its a little less embarrassing that they did n't have any plans or positions . 
  but with donald trump , he will be campaigning for * nearly a year * and he * still * has no sense on any policy positions . 
  if you literally look at his wiki page he contradicts himself 2-3 times within a paragraph . 
  good o ' unionists . 
  just wait for the scotland referendum and have boris johnson or nigel farage argue `` scotland is stronger in the uk '', 
  hahaha . 
  the eu is very strict about tax havens and loopholes , i bet there would be trade retribution for the uk became a tax haven . 
  although i 'm not sure that it will , uk already has bermuda . 
  hey , its not our fault that the boris johnson got a bad case of * cowardice * while falling off his leave bandwagon . 
  yeah !, 
  we do n't want any more damn experts and their fear mongering !, 
  stop fearmongering, 
  not sure , maybe after article 50 is triggered there could be a way to bypass the uk directly into eea as soon as possible . 
  but the hardline ` leave ' campers will be very upset seeing that the uk has to follow eu regulations and free movement people , and this time - * without representation *, 
  the eu is the uk 's primary market , the only other area where the uk has any bit of significant trade is with the us . 
  and barack obama already said britain would be behind the eu on trade deals . 
  you ca n't just develop new trading partners over night , first off you already need a foothold into the market and it again takes years to negotiate free trade agreements . 
  one of the disadvantages of the uk being very competitive economically inside the eu is that it has n't focused enough outside . 
  stop fear mongering / s, 
  did you know coca-cola is the 2nd most understood word in the world besides ` o.k. '', 
  why would there be zero willingness ? 
  germany & uk already sent a battalion to the baltics . 
  the vast majority of aircraft operations in syria is ground attack against terrorists . 
  not much air to air operations , unless you count the border skirmish near turkey . 
  well if it meant the survival of their regime perhaps , they 'd either use a tactical nuclear weapon ( small radius , accurate ) to make an example , maybe drop it somewhere nearby to make a point . 
  if you look at north korea for example , their conventional armed forces has been eroding so much for decades that any hint of ` hostility ' from south korea/us it goes on to threaten nuclear war . 
  for russia at least now since they have a huge conventional military they may not turn to that . 
  well , russia could do a lightening strike and take the baltics , then threaten nuclear retaliation if nato tries to retake the land . 
  well they do n't rely on it in a sense that its their only tactic , but its their preferred choice . 
  that and i doubt either side wants a full scale war . 
  russia knows it ca n't handle it and the last thing europe wants on its mind is another problem to sort through . 
  even belarus is less than enthusiastic in turning into a russian invasion point . 
  - as they have been avoiding getting a russian airforce base on their territory . 
  well technically , article 5 ** does not specifically say ** say ** when ** or ** how ** member states should react . 
  for all you 'd know they would just slap on economic stations or wait up to 2 years to do something about it . 
  i think outright invading a nato country not to mention 3 would be a big enough wake up call for nato to do something , and i 'm pretty sure nato knows this . 
  i think russia already achieves what it wants to achieve by stopping nations from getting close to nato membership ( georgia , ukraine ) invading the baltics would n't be the hardest thing russia has faced but it will put up way too much risk for the benefit . 
  russia is going to suffer causalities either way , a few troops will be killed , some jets shot down , even if they conquer the capitals within a day , and guerilla movements will spur all over . 
  not to mention they would have to kill us/british/german troops stationed in the baltics . 
  and that would be a big no no . 
  the united states overreacts if one of its soldiers are held prisoner , if a battalion of us soldiers are killed the republicans ( right wing politics of the us ) would be calling armageddon on russia . 
  russia just wants to destabilize a region enough to make it stop whatever its doing , whether its in the georgia , eastern ukraine , or syria , i doubt nato or russia are stupid enough to get into a total war scenario . 
  yeah , again its only a matter of time , in this modern age in a total war scenario * no ones * navy is going to probably last the first week of battle . 
  sweden & germany 's navy will probably carry the majority of ship v. ship if there is any , rest of the baltic sea countries rely on mine-field tactics , but of course with french , uk , and us backup that could change . 
  from what i read the [ baltic fleet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_navy#western_military_district_-_western_joint_strategic_command ) really is not all that menacing .
