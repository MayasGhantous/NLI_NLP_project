  junker is just messing around like he [ always does ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jufxbhdsk9s ) you should of seen nigel 's speech where he said the majority of meps dont know how to fill out paper work then demanded that the eu negotiate free trade with the uk . 
  britain ruled 1/5 of the worlds population at one point , and now they are complaining about immigration . 
  by the commonwealth i assume brexiters do n't include ~ ~ non-white ~ ~ india & south africa for their take in trade an immigration . 
  i suppose there already are enough of british ~ ~ economic migrants ~ ~ expats in canada & australia as well . 
  more likely has to do with [ 1.5-4 million of their people starving to death ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bengal_famine_of_1943 ) due to british policies . 
  for the ~ ~ watch ~ ~ eu in a [ nutshell ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/arrpgzk/last-episode-of-got-in-a-nutshell ), 
  problem is this issue was all hyped up from the beginning . 
  immigration was overly exaggerated , and now its pretty clear that the leave campaign is back pedaling . 
  to get into the etfa or eea which iceland , norway , and switzerland have it requires the ** free movement of people , ** many of the people who voted will brexit will be visually upset when boris or whoever the next pm is ca n't keep those promises . 
  poor northern ireland . 
  pretty much all of the eeu potential was crushed when ukraine ( second most powerful member after russia of course ) got wrapped up into the crisis . 
  now russia has to be china 's bitch in the sco . 
  i would give anything for there to be another referendum the day after to see how many people * actually * shit themselves and did n't think the uk would really leave . 
  a 66 % majority would be too much . 
  close is < 1 % . 
  not a 4 % margin . 
  the uk election commission already said they would n't do a second referendum . 
  we think you guys should do the right thing and push the button . 
  do n't worry , we 'll take care of the anglosphere ( like we already have been for the last 6 decades . . ), 
  yes , i 'm not saying we should just forget this referendum because a bunch of out of touch old people voted to leave . 
  i 'm just saying the younger generation should of taken this more seriously , because this is a decision thats going to affect them alot more down the road than the 65 +, 
  no ` neutral arbiter ' is necessary . 
  the uk is leaving the eu , it only makes sense that the european union sends someone who can negotiate with eu interests . 
  lol of course not . 
  the uk is leaving the eu , clearly the eu needs to have someone representing eu interests when dealing with the breakup . 
  younger generations from nearly all countries make up less of the voting, 
  now they 're going to have an entire mess with scotland and ni . 
  ni is going to be in an awkward border place with the rest of ireland which will cause more irish nationalist tensions, 
  the referendum is nonbinding , and it can be voided if the majority of the british people choose too , there are already calls for a `` second referendum '' , i guarantee you if we had another poll/referendum the day after thursday it would of budged a considerable amount . 
  it would be interesting to have a poll/referendum the day after thursday , see how many people regretted their choice , lol . 
  technically parliament does n't have to follow the referendum , so lets say a few months or even years down the line before issuing article 50 there could be an unanimous agreement to void the referendum . 
   in the end i wo n't be surprised if we end up with a norway style deal that still has the single market + free movement . 
  in other words almost the exact same scenario except now we do n't even have a voice in the european parliament . 
  thats exactly whats going to happen , the uk is going to have to either join eea or etfa , all which require following eu regulations and free movement of people . 
  great job uk . 
  thats the problem , nearly 75 % of young people voted for remain while only 40 % of 65 + did . 
  and older people tend to vote more than younger people , so now this will effect the younger populations . 
  the older generation does n't care about free movement because they 're all in retirement homes now or something and were promised 350 million in nhs which was now removed . 
  they do n't even get the 350 million promised on nhs , nigel farage said that was a ` mistake ' . 
  it still does n't excuse it , i clearly remember the 350 number being one of the big propaganda pieces of the leave campigan , and all the buses and trolleys having it . 
  all the old people voted for leave because they heard they 'd get more into healthcare and limited immigration . 
  yeah i know , and the uk is ( was ) the second largest economy in the eu , its going to be weird trade limbos from here and until a few years, 
  both of those show something , polls have gotten * really unreliable and trustworthy , * but it also shows the rising anti-establishment mood in europe and definitely in america . 
  yeah , just curious how uk is going to go down , the uk might very go down into a path of a ` grey zone ' where it is n't officially apart of the eu but is n't separate either . 
  one of the main arguments for the `` leave '' camp was immigration , eec requires free movement of people among eu/eec states , so not sure how thats going to go down . 
  well , then what exactly was the point of brexit then ? 
  i do n't think anyone has a clue what is happening . 
  the eu is trying to clear the bullet from the chamber and get the uk out as fast as possible so they can get the euro back on track . 
  i agree , on bbc international all you hear is the former ` leave ' campaign saying how they 're gon na take their time and the scottish snp wanting another referendum . 
  problem is norway is in etfa and eec . 
  the great ironly is they get access to the eu single market , have to pay into it , but can not vote on regulation . 
  and the best part is , eec requires the ** free movement of people . 
  ** so imagine if the uk has to enter one of these only to allow more immigrants to come in after leaving brexit . 
  a big country like the us most likely is trying to focus on the big picture , not minor deals here and there . 
  as the us already has a solid relation with the uk i doubt the us will bend a knee to get conformable trade relations . 
  if the trans-pacific partnership and atlantic partnership are any clues the us is trying to bag and tag the majority economic zones . 
  ( most notably improving trans-altantic ties to counter russia and beef up forces in the pacific ), 
  depends on how tough the uk will be , if the new independent uk says they 're going to be tough on trade deals as they usual do then it might as well take up to over a decade . 
  austrailia-us free trade deals too pretty long ca n't expect the bureaucratic eu to do much better . 
  the uk is going to be in this limbo grey zone for probably two years until they elect a new pm and finally activate article 50 . 
  the uk might have to join an agreement with etfa or join the eea ( european economic area ), 
  eu just needs some stability in its politics now . 
  its good that we got this whole `` brexit '' thing behind us which has been dominating months preceding . 
  perhaps when other euro-skeptics in the eu see the economic hardships and political confusion going on in the uk now that will swell down their opinion . 
  seeing that david cameron refuses to enact article 50 and will leave that for the next pm , this will most likely drag on . 
  the brexit side is probably going to slowly sidestep or slow down the process once they realize whats happening . 
  i have a bad feeling this is going to drag on , as david cameron said he wo n't enact article 50 of the lisbon treaty and will leave that for the new pm , and with that it can take 2 years for the eu-uk to be officially separated , this could drag on ... and put the uk onto this weird limbo . 
  i do n't see what brexit has to gain from this . 
  the uk is going to either have to accept an etfa agreement or join the eea like norway , iceland , and switzerland . 
  each entitles some level of free movement of people and eu regulation . 
  its about time , after years of complaining its finally happening and i think everyone wants to get this over with . 
  my hope is britain does n't decide to drag this on for several years, 
  bush was pro mass immigration ? 
  it was a snarky comment and a hint of sarcasm to the commentor who said americans should n't comment on brexit, 
  well technically , according to the oecd better life report and un education index the us is ranked higher in education than the uk . 
  i do n't understand why you guys left , to have access to the eu market you need to join etfa , which apart of it is free movement of people , kind of goes against your whole idea on anti-immigration ? 
  i have a bad feeling about the us election now ... donald and boris dear lord . . going to be like bush and blair, 
  why would i complain about anyone commenting on commentary of any sort ? 
  just because something happens in china does n't mean the rest of the world ca n't comment on it . 
  same goes for americans on brexit or europeans on donald trump, 
  oh yes he did , and the ` vote leave ' campaign put that all over their buses and trolleys . 
  the point i was making is the ussr can not justify ethnic cleansing , imperialism , invasion , and massacres in an excuse to `` defend itself '' because it really was not defending itself . 
  its silly for you claim those were `` civil wars '' because they obviously were not . 
  a civil war takes place within a nation with two opposing sides . 
  there were not two opposing sides . 
  originally it was the western allies , nazi germany , later the ussr , and neutral countries trying to survive . 
  europe was not ` united ' or collectivized so i do n't know where in hell you honestly think its a civil war , plus the world wars did n't only happen in europe , happened in the pacific , as well in africa , and the majority of deaths from wwii actually suprisingly happened outside of europe if you include the indian famine and chinese famine and japanese occupation . 
  the point i was making if you quoted my entire thing is do n't post and complain about americans posting here since this reddit is american, 
  its okay , they have a * diet coke *, 
  they are still individual countries in the eu . . 
  i do n't understand how people can go and say the eu is undemocratic but happily be in nato where your men get sent to a battle freezer of another nation such as the us . 
  there was no `` civil war '' of europe , i do n't understand where you are getting this from . 
  it started out between a battle between to imperialistic powers , the ussr and nazi germany who were allied and made the molotov-ribbentrop pact that got us into this mess . 
  especially when finland was a * neutral * country that had no intend on invading the soviet union . 
  that backed fire when finland fought to reclaim its lost territory in the continuation war . 
  ussr even did a [ false flag operation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ) in which nvkd officers bombed their own soldiers for a casi bell . 
  do n't try to hide your imperialistic manners . 
  the soviet union was even more brutal than nazi germany in many cases . 
  through [ invading and annexing neutral countries , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact#the_secret_protocol ) [ acts of ethnic cleansing of newly conquered territories , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) , and [ brutal massacres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nkvd_prisoner_massacres ) * the ussr was not defending its border , the ussr invaded countries like finland because it was imperialistic like nazi germany . 
  its a disingenuous claim to make that , considering that was their slogan on the the majority of the `` leave buses '',
