  i changed it from us to earth from finland ,, 
   well , it is a good thing for ~ ~ british ~ ~ ` russian exports ' exact same thing russia was saying after 2014 sanctions and a drop in oil . 
  lol, 
  the us has several air force bases in the uk , this might be interesting . .    :d payback time brits, 
  seeing that nigel just revoked the 350mil on nhs this is going to be a funny and awkward exit . 
  its the third largest economy , not second . 
  this is an american website , get use to it . 
  the us does n't want to impose another marshall plan if europe goes to down the drain and russia is feeling more trigger happy . 
  scotland 's gon na jump off the sinking boat . 
  so now you guys do n't want to leave ? 
  its already going to take 2 years for the uk and eu to separate , better pack your bags and move out now . 
  leave campigan has already just said they wo n't use the 350mil on nhs . 
  good job . 
  leave campaign has already taken away their 350mil promise for nhs . 
  this is going to be funny . 
  its going to take about 2 years for the separation to finalize . 
  good job, 
  i feel bad for the young people , nearly 3/4s of them voted remain , its the older generation 65 + that still have a devious view of postwar germany . 
  the russian revolution happened in 1917 . 
  second world war started in wwii . 
  the ussr 's grief is no excuse for it to ** invade neural country , annex them , and commit ethnic cleansing and massacres ** . 
  i 'm not talking about the soviet famine policies , i 'm talking about the massacres , annexation of other nations , imperialism , and political killings . 
  you can not counter my point.this goes way above the russian civil war . 
  i 'm talking about the millions that died in the guluag system throughout wwii even to the 1950s , the annexations , ethnic cleansings , and [ nvkd operations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nkvd_prisoner_massacres ), 
  little ironic , uk left the eu to `` regain sovereignty '' little ironic seeing the uk might very well split up . 
  how does that make any sense , that is irrelevant . 
  no it was not . . ? 
  capitalism was doing pretty fine for itself . 
  it was about ideology an totalitarianism, 
  it was not a civil war are you stupid . 
  the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) was a fight between two sovereign states , in which the [ ussr signed official border agreements . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_ ( russian % e2 % 80 % 93finnish ) ), 
  you should of seen how ` ecstatic ' nigel was, 
  uk is the 3rd largest economy and military in the eu . 
  since the eu is leaving its signaling a collapse of the european project , and could cause the entire eu to be destroyed too . 
  not to mention the economic impact thats happening right now . 
  its over , be prepared for another scottish referendum and a possible step down by david cameron, 
  two world wars were not about capitalism , lol . 
  probably the most anti-capitalistic practices happened during/before wwii such as the new deal policies , tarriffs , and price floors/roofs during the war effort and rationing, 
  not so sure about that , france has already overtaken the uk as a nato contributor to military activities . 
  the uk now is just really a place to sell you f-35s ( which all repairs have to take place in the us ) and a place for our airfields to be to bomb the middle east . 
  most of it has to do with euro-skepticism , people who do n't want to be apart of the eu . 
  main points were immigration and sovereignty . 
  not sure how this referendum solves that, 
  i have a feeling that the us is going to have to 're - enter ' europe again . . 
  i think the kremlin are happy tonight . 
  so were the two world wars , in which the second one killed over ** 60 million people ** a third of them their own civilians, 
  except you did n't have to kill imperials over it , and half your population disagreed with it . 
  the uk is still apart of nato ... you can never escape the american dominion  ;d, 
  why on earth would you want to dismantle european cooperation ? 
  how else are approximately 50 highly industrialized nations inside a country called europe suppose to interact ? 
  nato supreme commander is american , not sure what you mean by power dynamic considering the us has several air force bases in the uk , some 40 minutes from london . 
  they 're gon na be exactly like norway , having to follow all of eu regulations but have no voting . 
  kremlin must be celebrating . 
  thank god , i thought it was only our country that had a messed up populist wing . 
  i do n't see how scotland would n't be able to join ? 
  not sure how thats gon na happen when all of your trade partners will treat you second rate . 
  not to mention scotland wanting to rejoin the eu, 
  ** hell would be raised ** if they did not follow the referedum, 
  leave camp wants the uk to have more `` sovereignty '' and `` power '' not sure how thats gon na happen if scotland leaves . 
  i have a bad feeling we 're gon na need to send more economic aid and military support to europe now . 
  rip all of our efforts in developing post-war europe . 
  in all honestly in an outside view the commonwealth does n't do much , maybe cross-country immigration but nothing much else . 
  they would n't ? 
  would n't it be ironic talking about `` sovereignty and powerful '' uk when a big portion of your kingdom leaves ? 
  single market ,, 
  yeah this sucks , i 'm kind of curious to see how this all plays out , would be a ' i told you so '' moment . 
  has n't even been 5 minutes and snp is talking about a referendum . 
  really worth it ? 
  david cameron is on suicide watch lmao, 
  well , there goes all of the hard effort the us put into the marshall plan . . european integration and nato ... thanks uk you were suppose to be the sherriff in europe . 
  vladimir putin must be celebrating now . 
  yay111 now scotland can leave the uk !, 
  ! 111 more soverignity111 !, 
  good luck , the united states basically replaced the commonwealth , the us is the sole leader of the english hegemony . 
  70 % of canada trade is with the us , the us provides for canadian defense too . 
  the us has anzac defense with both new zealand and australia , and is a big economic partner there too . 
  the uk is suppose to be the sheriff in the eu . 
  after wwii and the cold war we thought you guys could handle yourselves . 
  guess not , vladimir putin must be celebrating right now . 
  looks like the us will retake the position of the # 1 economy by a large margin now . 
  aye bbc has already called it though, 
  on bbc some snp politicans are already talking about it . 
  most of the major world leaders from the us to germany to japan and china said the uk will be second rate to the eu . 
  right now the pound sterling is taking a hit . 
  great irony that the uk left the eu to gain more `` soverigenity '' yet scotland might leave ,, 
  na made , the british treasury , us , germany , france , japan , and chinese leaders have all said the uk 's economy will go down if brexit happens . 
  they need to learn to deal with the consequences, 
  there was n't even a good reason to leave in the first place . 
  they kept saying that the ` economy would improve ' if the uk left . 
  how would the economy improve by leaving the single biggest market in the world ? 
  even the british treasury adviced against leaving , and the brexit team said `` we can make our own trade deals '' even when leaders from the ** us , germany , france , japan , and china ** said that the uk would be in the back of the que for trades . 
  and in order you trade with the eu you have to follow eu regulations , so by leaving your essentially like norway , they have to follow eu eec but have no say over law making . 
  i 'm not even sure how you solve immigration , leaving the eu does n't stop the migrants from wanting to go to the uk , but now the uk ca n't negotiate or cooperate with the eu on immigration . 
  nooo, 
  majority of northern irelanders want to stay with the uk , scotland is gon na be a wild card . 
  it would be interesting to see scotland stay with eu . 
  trump & boris ... imagine . . 
  pretty much a fool , only had solidarity with him at 9/11 , after that and the iraq war it was n't happy feelings , ironically europeans like barrack obama alot more than you americans back home .
