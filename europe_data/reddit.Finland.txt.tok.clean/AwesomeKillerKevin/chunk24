  none , the majority in northern ireland want to remain in the uk, 
  great , leave has even a bigger lead . 
  the uk is the 3rd largest economy and military power in the eu . 
  if the uk leaves it does n't leave a good mark on the european project , especially if other countries want their own ` brexit ', 
  trump & boris , it 'll be like bush and blaire, 
  54 % to 46 % really britain ? 
  leaving the eu will solve nothing , they will be just like norway or iceland , they 'll have to follow the trade regulations just like norway or iceland to get into the eu market . 
  most likely has to do with the feelings of wwii . 
  britain fought to stop germany 's domination of europe , yet nowdays in the eu they see germany the head of european politics yet again . 
  atleast brexit does n't have a one mil lead anymore . 
  ai n't gon na be another next , its gon na fall apart is another country wants a referedum . 
  people in america are starting to sweat , if brexit can happen then trump can happen too . 
  and do what ? 
  return to its commonwealth ? 
  hell no , the us owns the english hegemony now , the us makes up 70 % of canada 's trade , and provides for its defense . 
  same goes for australia and new zealand . 
  eurasian union ? 
  damn , exit leading by half a mil , rip eu, 
  the kremlin must be celebrating right now . 
  tonights decision is going to wash away the 0-3 game in wales favor to a smirk on vladimir putin 's face . 
  it looks like london and scotland wo n't be feeding remain alot of votes tonight anymore . 
  build a wall, 
  this is a referendum so its popular vote , the mapping is a little bit disingenuous . 
  as you can see the areas in/around london are carrying alot of weight . 
  yeah , whether the uk leaves the eu or not , you 're gon na be the same distance between the english channel . 
  if anything you made your immigration worse by losing your voice in the eu . 
  you can probably get away from the immigration problem if you were norway or something , but not a high destination country . 
  i really do n't care about the eu itself , but i care for what it stands for , european cooperation . 
  even countries outside of the eu such as iceland and norway are still great at participating in our eec and general security outlook . 
  i just dislike the way how some brexiters are just like `` yeah screw europe , we do n't need them !, 
  isolationism '', 
  alright thanks , its a bit annoying refreshing every 15 seconds and hard to follow convos . 
  the us is basically has the entire eu population ( us has the 3rd largest population in the world ) do n't think it makes a difference to you guys anyways , if the uk left nato then that would be something . 
  i do n't think i auto refresh , i get the live feed but i have to right click and refresh every 15 seconds to cycle through the comments . 
  any way i could fix this ? 
  i ca n't even tell if this page is refreshing or not . 
  damn , brexit is regaining strength, 
  watch there be another scotland referedum, 
  one ballot paper ? 
  and do you even know if its a ballot paper ? 
  how on earth would it be better in the long wrong ? 
  economically the british treasury , and nearly all of the uk 's largest trading partners say the uk will be at the end of the que for trade if they leave . 
  ( including germany , france , us , japan ) . 
  leaving the eu does n't solve a damn problem about immigration either ,, 
  bremain in the lead, 
  god save the ~ ~ queen ~ ~ bremain, 
  oh remain is catching up, 
  remain has to pull more weight in england or it all goes down the gutter . 
  i would agree , but there really is n't much that could be done . 
  same thing with the dutch non-binding referedum on the eu association with ukraine . 
  many people took the opportunity to voice dislike for the eu . 
  if the uk leaves , it leaves , we just have to adjust for it . 
  todays results will put a smirk on putin 's face after the 0-3 wales loss . 
  the fact of the matter is europe is filled with approximately 50 highly industrialized countries with diverse cultures and interests . 
  i really do n't see how else the countries are going to cooperate together without being in some kind of form of conscensus , whether it be the eu or something else . 
  if the eu just disappeared the next day , everything would n't just decentralize , even members outside of the eu ( such as norway and iceland ) already do have the majority of eu laws and ways of doing business . 
  this still does not justify the [ mass killings and ethnic cleansing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_killings_under_communist_regimes#soviet_union ) that took place under the ussrs ~ ~ annexation ~ ~ ` occupation ' . 
  you could say the same exact thing for nazi germany . 
  nazi germany only invaded france , norway , and denmark to `` protect '' itself from the soviet union . 
  fact of the matter is the ussr was playing the same game of imperialism as nazi germany was , stalin just thought he had a little extra time to prepare . 
  still does not justify invading finland or the other countless countries which were neutral . 
  russia 's invasion of finland if anything made russia less safe . 
  as finland later fought to reclaim its land , at the same time when nazi germany invaded western russia , good job !, 
  hell , the prior to the german invasion into germany , the russian nvkd and gestapo were [ best buddies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo%e2%80%93nkvd_conferences ), 
  i do n't think i ever claimed the [ moscow armistice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_armistice ) which ended the continuation war was unfair . 
  the original point i was making on this post was that it is silly for the russian federation to make land grabs ( such as crimea ) from their own historical interpretation since their history is filled with it such as the [ winter war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) * the moral high ground was not lost in the winter war . 
  if you have forgotten , the winter war was started by a [ false flag operation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war#shelling_of_mainila ) in which the ussr shelled its own troops to remove its non-aggression treaty with finland and undo the treaty of tartu . 
  the league of nations at the time kicked the ussr out for its actions , not to mention russia 's already planned molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  the continuation war was fought to reclaim lost territories from the winter war and fight back against [ soviet pressures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war#background ) that plagued it from the winter war . 
  * for the most part finland did stay within its pre-winter war borders . 
  finland even refused german pledges to directly engage in leningrad , instead finland stayed at its defensive line [ 30km from leningrad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_leningrad#finnish_participation ) in the pre-winter war border . 
  honestly if finland really wanted to cripple the ussr they would of attacked there . 
  * i would argue that the finnish advance into eastern karelia was to root out russian attack positions ( which were used against finland in the winter war ) and help out and evacuate finnic karelians there who did make up the majority of the population . 
  for example , the [ army of karelia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_of_karelia ) fought to ** `` reclaim the areas lost to the soviet union in the winter war , but also to advance deeper into soviet territory to gain a more easily defensible front . 
  '' **  you are not much better than the soviets no , we are actually a lot better . 
  the majority of the deaths from the camps were from a failed harvest and the war effort . 
  unlike the soviets , finland actually [ improved camp conditions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war#finnish_occupation_policy ) when voiced out by international concerns . 
  while the soviet union [ executed its soldiers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_prisoners_of_war_in_finland#aftermath ) who returned home from war . 
  the conditions in the camps ( after the failed harvest in 1941-43 ) really were not that bad , if you want to [ read more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_prisoners_of_war_in_finland#continuation_war ) the detention camps were there for a reason , there was [ soviet partisan attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_partisans#finland_and_karelia ) * its a ** little funny ** when you compare finland to the ussr , considering the ussr invaded several neutral countries , [ killed millions of their own people through the gulag system . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag#brief_history ) and did ** actual ** [ ethnic cleansing and massacres , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_killings_under_communist_regimes#soviet_union ) such as killing over 150,000 poles by nkvd operations . 
  here 's an actual source of nkvd massacres : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nkvd_prisoner_massacres#overview, 
  pretty sure they have separate records for civilian and military deaths , but yeah , reliability can be an issue . 
  except the soviet union invaded eastern poland , estonia , lithuania , latvia , and finland when they were neutral countries and not even apart of the axis at the time . 
  why was n't jesus born in russia ? 
  he could n't find 3 wise men or a virgin . 
  they do n't accept appeals ;( . 
  maybe if i make a new account and put cccp as my flair then i 'd fit in more . 
  it would be ironic if ukraine just decides to not want the eastern territories anymore , then russia would be put in the awkward situation of having to accept them and pay to rebuild those areas . 
  i do n't think it would be such a bad thing is russia ` pivoted to the east ' . 
  hell russia and china can be bffs for all i care . 
  only problem is china & russia really only trade energy and weapons , nothing else really, 
  i think you are arguing too way back , most of the soviet historians stay within the 20th century for the border claims . 
  the official borders between russia & finland were finalized by the [ treaty of tartu 1920 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_ ( russian % e2 % 80 % 93finnish ) which confirmed by old border between the autonomous grand duchy of finland and imperial russia . 
  the treaty expired at the start of the winter war in which the ussr invaded finland . 
   argument for karelia could be better framed as unfair border after wwii ( loss disproportional to soviet losses caused by finland in continuation war ) . 
  that could be defensible . 
  * in the finnish view the winter war and the continuation war were apart of one conflict , similiar to as russians see the ussr in wwii as apart of the ` great patriotic war ' . 
  either way , finland wanted to follow neutrality just as sweden had . 
  if the soviet union never invaded finland in the first place , there probably would n't of been a continuation war .
