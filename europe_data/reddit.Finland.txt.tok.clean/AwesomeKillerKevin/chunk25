  * the soviet union suffered a lot more causalities in the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) than in the [ continuation war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ), 
  seems very unlikely now . . 
  well with donetsk and luhansk then russia would also be responsible to rebuilding the region of war and taking care of its citizens . 
  transnistria is geographically isolated , and really does n't solve any value to russia besides being escalation tool in eastern europe . 
  i think russia perhaps is already getting everything it wants politically from transnistria , adding it to be apart of russia would be unnecessary and cost more money . 
  russia already can use the region as a geopolitical escalation tool , for recruitment ( as this article says ) and an airport for troops . 
  800,000 causalities compared to 4,000,000 . 
  damn , and mother russia was on the defensive . 
  yeah i know that , i 'm just saying most of the people who probably already joined the russian army are ethnic russians . 
  its very fascinating how russia can resupply all of its semi-isolated western outposts in europe . 
  especially if your kaliningrad surrounded by nato forces in both ground and sea . 
  hmm . . interesting , maybe that 's why russia was extra jumpy with the [ us missile defense base in romania . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/world/europe/russia-nato-us-romania-missile-defense.html?_r=0 ) we certainly would n't want to ground all russian aviation units . 
  erm , i got it off demographics of wiki , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria, 
  finland lost its karelia region to annexation to russia in wwii . 
  vladimir putin said the same thing `` correctly historically wrong borders '' , yet he forgot to mention that finland was apart of sweden . 
  i honestly do n't begrudge them . 
  all these `` empires '' whether it be the british or ussr are overly romanticized , especially when its the only thing holding your country identity together . 
  thankfully the uk does n't go around reassuring itself over its former colonies ~ ~ because america would tell them to ** fuck off ** ~ ~ because its evolved past that . 
  modern day russia ... not so much , still nostalgic for the past . 
  its the same reason why russia wo n't `` accept '' the donetsk and luhansk , they 're just there for show to destabilize the region when the central government gets to cozy with the west . 
  plus i do n't think moscow has the money or military will to reinforce those areas with russian forces . 
  ( practically they already are ), 
  how exactly does russia plan to reinforce transnistria ? 
  its right between moldova and ** western ** ukraine . 
  last time i checked ukraine is n't all cozy about russian troops going through its territory . 
  plus i imagine the black sea being a minefield of nato & russian vessels . 
  there 's a considerable russian population in moldova . 
  in transnitvia ethnic russians make up 30 % of the population . 
  how does russia actually reinforce transistria ? 
  its right between moldova and ** western ukraine . 
  ** and yeah ukraine is n't really cozy with russia right now . 
  `` russia 's security service has raided over a dozen locations linked to the church of scientology in the latest step of a long-running battle between authorities and the ** us-based organization ** '', 
  everyone was in a land grab stage in the beginning of ww2 . 
  it was a war of gathering the most resources by lightening attack before supplies ran out . 
  whether it be nazi germany seizing western europe and north africa , the soviet union and eastern europe . 
  or early allied efforts such as the uk seizing iceland , and franco-british expeditions to seize the ore mines in northern sweden . 
  https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/teaching-world-war-ii not sure if this helps, 
  while in america if you do n't like ~ ~ barack obama ~ ~ the current us president you 're called a patriot . 
  i got banned from / r/russia from asking them what they think about the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) and what they are taught in schools . 
  afterwards i got into an argument with a guy who said stalin `` never planned '' on ~ ~ holding finland peacefully ~ ~ annexing finland and called it `` western propaganda . '', 
  finland during the winter war ( and later the continuation war ) had some soviet sympathizers , some who created `` finnish democratic republic '' to puppet over finland . 
  sadly when the war ended and prisoners exchanged happened many were executed for failure or sent to the gulags . 
  you honestly ca n't blame them , too many countries to remember which ones ` joined ', 
  good thing finland did n't get annexed in ww2 . . 
   they had a non belligerence pact that ended up dividing poland it ended up dividing much more than poland . 
  the molotov-pact treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of romania , poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia , and finland . 
  both the ussr and nazi germany were horrendous for their occupants . 
  it does not justify either to annex territories , displace their populations and damaging them for years to come . 
  stalin planned the `` sovietization of europe '' . 
  russia was doing alot more than creating ` buffer zones ' as evident to the end of wwii where the soviet union held onto its conquered territories , and invaded neutral territories in the first place . 
  ussr and nazi germany were both as pillaging to their occupants , the germany strategy was to create buffers too , you know ? 
  the communist countries such as the ussr and china [ disproportionately ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#classification_of_casualties ) had massive causalities on their civilians due to famine policies or execution . 
  i 'm not saying the allies were all dandelions but both the ussr and nazi germany were both brutally battling empires fighting the same game . 
  `` brexit map of britain ( excluding northern ireland ) '' is n't northern ireland not apart of britain island in the first place ? 
  around 22 % of the us population is `` religiously unaffiliated '', 
  [ / r/russiadenies ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russiadenies/ ), 
  how is this churchillian propaganda ? 
  ussr and germany did have a secret protocol to split europe in half , the molotov pact . 
  the ussr did attempt or did annex the following countries . 
  russia did suffer over a quarter million causailities in the winter war . 
  and stalin did kill alot of his own people through the great purge , gulags , and famine policies ? 
  [ ahem ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russiadenies ), 
   either falklands islands referendum was fixed too , or your argument about impossibility of such high percentage in `` a democratic system like voting '' is invalid . 
  you choose . 
  except it was not during a crisis period , there were international observers from the united states , from canada , mexico , uruguay , paraguay , chile and new zealand and the un referendum international observation mission . 
  oh , and most importantly , ** it was not commend illegal by the un and called an act of invasion . 
  **  under what law , exactly ? 
  please cite . 
  it was illegal because it violated ukrainian international integrity . 
  the un passed united nations general assembly resolution 68/262 , the resolution [ affirmed the general assembly 's commitment to the territorial integrity of ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and underscored the invalidity of the 2014 crimean referendum . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#supranational_bodies ) 51.81 % of the un general assembly supported the resolution . 
  only 5.70 % rejected it , while the rest were abstained or absent . 
  and again , if you actually look at [ the too few countries that recognize the crimea referedum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#reactions ) you have a bunch of irrelevant countries with poor human rights and democracy records such as north korea , venezula , cuba , sudan etc. 
  not even china , india , or any middle power for that matter accept the referendum . 
  if the international community does n't approve of it , then obviously you can not think this was ` legitimate ' . 
   too bad no factual proof was provided . 
  literally `` he said , she said '' . 
  that 's not a very strong argument . 
  check the youtube video of the rebel leader, 
  perhaps there would of been less causalities on the soviet side if they ** actual fought germany ** instead of having a secret alliance to conquer europe . 
  ussr invaded neutral countries such as estonia , lithuania , latvia , romania , finland and eastern poland . 
  in the winter war alone , against finland a neutral country that really had no military capability , the ussr had [ over a quarter million causalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) , and finland had no connection to germany or intent to attack the soviet union . 
  and a big portion of the ussr 's causalities , like china , [ was due to dictatorship , famine policies , and mass murder . 
  ] ( http://www.distributedrepublic.net/archives/2006/05/01/how-many-did-stalin-really-murder/ ) i 'm not saying the ussr did n't have a big impact on defeating germany , they certainly took the heaviest toll . 
   at this point it 's a matter of opinion . 
  seeing your charged words in this paragraph yes . 
  germany was split into the east and west , throughout the cold war you can see a clear distinction of how prosperous the west was compared to the east , so much so that the russians had to * build walls to keep people in * east germany . 
  as for japan , they accepted unconditional surrender . 
  you are charging your language too much , the us does n't want to nuke the soviet union or china . 
  and countries like germany and japan actually want us troops there as a deterrence . 
  south korea wants us troops to deter north korea , japan wants us troops to help its claim in the south china sea , and germany wants the us to re-enter the european zone to deal with the resurgent russia . 
  poland and the baltics specifically asked for us troops ,, 
  of course there was intimidation , do you honestly think russian troops can just take over crimea and there be no issues ? 
  ethnic ukrainians and crimean tartars make up 30 % of the population , yet there was a vote of 96.77 % to join the russian federation . 
  dude , in a democratic system like voting , use common sense . 
  its clearly has been fixed , no other election or referendum would be so close to 100 % . 
  especially during a national crisis and war . 
  the scotland referendum and many others show how illogical it is to have results like that .
