  there were no international observers there because the referedum was illegal in the first place . 
  they would n't be able to do anything . 
  it does n't even matter because russia is outnumbered 11:1 to countries that actually recognize it . 
  and the countries that do are nations like venezula , cuba , north korea which will never get investments in crimea and have horrible human rights records . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#reactions ** in an interview on 22 january 2015 igor strelkov ( a popularized rebel leader in russia ) admitted that his militia group coerced crimean deputies to vote in favor of secession from ukraine . 
  ** ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mccqrzctxh4 ) the mayor of the crimean capital even said there were gangs going around stealing passports from people who voted for ukraine . 
  ( http://news.sky.com/story/1223779/ukraine-intimidation-ahead-of-crimea-vote ) . 
  on top of that russian national citizens w/o ukrainian citizenship in ukraine were allowed to vote , how silly is that, 
  yeah , finland really just needs structural reform , we 're in the positive gdp growth , thats something , it just needs to hit above 2 %, 
   the neutering of germany and japan was a british and american imposition . 
  i would n't go as far to say that germany and japan are defenseless , they just do n't have the foriegn policy ambition . 
  they still are some of the [ most powerful countries in the world ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) i do n't think a weak germany/japan is in american interests . 
  us wants a strong germany to keep the eu together and offer a counter-balance to russia when it ca n't be everywhere at once . 
  and with the united state 's pivot to asia , the us wants a strong japan to counter china 's influence as well . 
   eh , google it up , dude . 
  as far as i can remember , there were some ( far ) right mps from some european countries , nothing major . 
  i asked for international observers , it seems you have none . 
  the western world treats democracy fine . 
  do you honestly think that it was going to be a legitimate referendum ? 
  it was obviously fixed . 
  russian soldiers were n't just gon na walk off crimea if they voted to stay in ukraine . 
  russia for years has had problems with corruption and vote counting in its own country , i doubt they can do a legitimate referendum anywhere else . 
  point being so * no international observers were present * crimea was and is still considered apart of ukraine while the whole crisis was happening , it should of been ukraine 's government who did the referedum , not russia annexing it and fixing the results * more importantly the un general assembly , voted against it , 11 to 1 . 
  * no significant countries recognize crimea as apart of russia , having cuba , venezula , and north korea recognize it is an embarrassment *, 
  keep dreaming . 
  again , you have 28 states cramped into one continent expecting the border countries to provide security . 
  you have germany , the largest economy and pretty much the de facto leader of the eu that is afraid to ramp up its military against russian aggression due to wwii guilt . 
  then you have gb trying to neglect the eu all together with brexit . 
  and france has actually done something protective by airstriking in syria and intervening in mali . 
  the majority of nato members do n't even reach 2 % . 
  except china does not need russia , it actually can do better without . 
  thats why china did n't jump aboard and support russia in ukraine in fear of damaging relations with the west of the world . 
  russia & china trade volumes have been decreasing since 2014 . 
  well , if you are going off [ availability heuristics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/availability_heuristic ) i think many countries would prefer iran . 
  us northern europeans do n't really need to worry about whats going down south . 
   europe is an hostile area which will always exclude russia ahem ... * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%e2%80%9306_russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_dispute * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_dispute * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_russia%e2%80%93belarus_energy_dispute * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_policy_of_russia#energy_disputes russia simply can not live off energy exports anymore . 
  yeah , sure , maybe the oil market will improve back to $ 100 a barrel down the road , but more countries are using energy sufficent cars , and more renewable energies , you can not reserve that flow . 
  both china & russia barely make it into each other 's 3rd largest trading partner . 
  the only trade that consists of those two countries is oil and the arms industry, 
  must be , pretty sure sweden has the 8th largest military industry or something . 
   the main goal of the us-empire is to prevent the alliance between germany and russia you need to do better than a simple youtube link and some random guy talking on stratfor . 
  i can find any article i want on stratfor to bolster my point , like this one ( https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/russias-strategy ) ( https://www.stratfor.com/sample/analysis/russias-expanding-influence-part-1-necessities ) which says russia wants to destabilize the eu and re-create another sphere of influence under a russian union . 
  believe it or not , the us has actually very little to do with europe nowdays , as its focused on the pivot to asia . 
  europe and the us are n't each others trading partners . 
  for all the us is concerned with for eu/nato is to provide extra backup for a resurgent russia as it did . 
  that being sad , nato is an european organization , only 2 of its 28 members are outside of europe ( that being canada and the us ) . 
  the secretary general of nato is european , it was european governments that wanted us troops there . 
  only 1 of the 4 battalions sent to reinforce the baltics are from the us . 
  ( germany , uk are to send one each , the 4th will be determined later ) . 
  europe is already very reluctant to follow in the us 's footsteps in foriegn policy , i think you are blowing it out of proportion of `` us domination '' . 
  if europe really did n't like the way the us was handling nato they could just simply get rid of nato and form a single eu defense force . 
  but they wo n't because europe is , to a degree dependent on us security , the us is the only other country who can outmatch russia , so it makes sense for the eu to want the us at its side . 
  * france called nato into mali during operation serval * kosovowhether you agree with it or not , was headed by european forces within nato * and now the current ukraine crisis with rotational forces is european aswell called by baltics & poland  and yes , poland and the baltics did call for nato troops ( with or without the us influence ) and the us was more than happy to provide those , because it fits their own agenda . 
  the result would in an extreme case cause yet another proxy war located far away from the us territory . 
  lmao , i think you are getting to conspiratorial here . 
  nato is a defense alliance , so when one member is in need others go help . 
  the us one battalion of the 4 total planned . 
  so what observers did go there then ? 
   so what ? 
  that 's their political stance , nothing more . 
  it matters quiet alot of the rest of the world , including the un does not recognize the crimea . 
  as you probably already no , no investments can be made in crimea , and there already are problems with its political status in the upcoming olympics . 
  it matters because virtually no one things russia is right on the issue of annexing crimea . 
  when you have 28 states scrammed into a continent called europe its pretty hard to have a common unified approach . 
  especially when the most powerful country in the eu ( germany ) is afraid of using its own military force , then you have your second most powerful country whos going through economic troubles ( france ) and then your arguably third largest economy wanting to do a brexit . 
  rip finland ** #stopnordstreamii **, 
  well , if you are like georgia or ukraine , russia is very aware of that fact and acted accordingly . 
  if europe really needed to , they can revamp defense spending ( as they already are starting to reverse the years of defense cuts post-cold war ) . 
  might help if countries start reintroducing conscription like finland does , then it creates a market/need for defense spending and equipment . 
  although i 'm not a real fan of right wing parties , i hear the swedish democrats and afd wanting to reintroduce conscription . 
  conscription is actually still popular in both countries like sweden and germany . 
  i 'm not religious myself , but it is interesting watching ` russian orthodoxy '' defending `` family values '' . 
  i guess i can kind of see how the very religious minority in europe ( and especially in the us ) could relate to that . 
  rip , finland 's not giving up without a fight . 
  rt news is a headache , but its mostly conspiratoral people who go to their website , people who you ca n't really change with rational thought . 
  in nearly every comment section i read something about the nwo or russia being the new `` christian savior '', 
  i think in a perfect world , yes , everyone wants `` free trade '' with everyone . 
  but be under no illusion , russia has some of the most protective tariffs in the whole world , he wanted the eu to negotiate within his own eurasian economic union so investment does n't flood his central asian states . 
  i think its a little too far saying that the us is ` bullying ' europe . 
  the us was not the one who cut oil supplies for geopolitical goals , and it was actually european countries ( baltic states & poland ) that asked for us troops in eastern europe , not the us itself . 
  that and the domestic public in the us is getting kind of tried of sending us troops to defend europe at nato 's expense . 
  ( us spending is 60 % of nato ), 
  problem is russia does not want a free trade zone . 
  russia has some of the most protective tarriffs in the world . 
  russia planned for there to be some sort of trade zone between the eu and eurasian economic union ( former ussr republics ) , but that dream was obviously destroyed with the ukraine crisis . 
  that and the other states in ~ ~ putins new ussr ~ ~ the eeu are usually all poor , oil depedent countries which are directly reliant on the russian market . 
  rip , this is the guy who wants nord stream ii . 
  what international observers were there ? 
  there was an absence of un and osce observers . 
  no serious country even recognizes the referedum . 
  does n't help the case that countries such as north korea , cuba , and venezula only see it . 
  even belarus is trying to side step out of it . 
  their trade relationship is mainly just around military equipment and energy . 
  although there is some effort for the `` new silk road '' and such those are still in its infancy and harboring no real results . 
  and from the fall of oil and sanctions on russia , their trade volume is decreasing . 
  same in finland , 4th largest gun ownership . 
  and thats due to finland being a neutral country , not being apart of any military alliances , ( and having the russian federation as our neighbor ) . 
  i think its a little unfair that countries apart of military alliances ( such as nato ) do n't get penalized in their ` peaceness ' while neutral countries that need conscription ( such as switzerland , finland , austrailia ) do get penalized . 
  i ai n't saying iceland is n't a peaceful country , but they have their military handled for them in nato . 
  i think its unlikely that ukraine will ever join nato , eu is a different story , with the current vibe in the eu not sure enlargement is an option right now,
