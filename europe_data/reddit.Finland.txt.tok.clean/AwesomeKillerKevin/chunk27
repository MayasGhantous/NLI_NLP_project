  russia does have alot of good tech , problem is they ca n't modernize their entire force , before they planned 70 % of military equipment to be modernized , and now due to sanctions and low oil they have to settle near 30 %, 
  lolno , did you see russia 's logistics in the russo-georgian war ? 
  they ca n't command and control or coordinate that well . 
  not saying they came out of no where . 
  but you can not claim after mass deportation and native emigration influxation thats its defiantiy justified to be invaded . 
  it was a joke because the ussr got kicked out of it and wwii happened . 
  and it also failed to represent major powers such as the usa which did n't join it . 
  the new un made sure major powers had a say in it. ,, 
  nato is a european organization , it was the baltic states and poland ( who are european states in nato ) who called for rotational forces including us forces on their territory , not the us . 
  it was the france ( a nato and european country ) that called for nato support during their africa conflict in mali . 
  sadly even though europe is the biggest economic union , it does not have a common defense and security policy ,, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea according to this it was above 35 %, 
  the falkland islands referendum was not done under armed military occupation where there was widespread intimidation . 
  no international observors were allowed in crimea during the voting , in falklands it was , and it was n't during a state of crisis like crimea . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) 1992 constitutional powers means its autonomous within ukraine . 
  do you really think russia would of let crimea rejoin ukraine after they put military troops there and already dissolved parliament ? 
  i meant the bolshevik government, 
  rip , finland 's in 11th place , must be because of our gun ownership . 
  finland was never a russian oblast , and finland was apart of the sweden before russia , surprisingly invaded and annexed it . 
  and in 1917 tsar russia actually signed finnish independence, 
  the league of nations was the equivalent to the un back then . 
  nato is a european organization , only 2 of the 28 members are outside of europe , ( canada & usa ) . 
  the us is the strongest military in the world , it makes sense . 
  seeing that russia has probably the second military strongest military , it makes perfect sense for us forces to be there . 
  and the 4 battalions being sent to eastern europe , only one of them is american , rest are european, 
  do n't get me wrong , russia probably has one of the ** largest and most powerful land based militarizes in the world , ** but russia 's military is still in the semi-professional stage . 
  russia does have the most conventional artillery and combat tanks in the world , but most of it is soviet-era technology and not kept in the best condition . 
  despite the `` modernization program '' that is taking place in russia , they still suffer logistical issues , and with economic sanctions and falling oil prices , its really only the specialized and elite units of its military that get modernized equipment . 
  could russia occupy the baltics and perhaps poland ? 
  sure , but its defiantly in no position to hold out in long term military operations . 
  skeptical , this decade alot of russia 's collaboration efforts have ~ ~ been stopped by the new world order ~ ~ really failed . 
  * china and russia were suppose to be a thing , yet it really has n't rooted out to much besides weapons deal and stalled gas pipelines * well with the ukraine crisis , there goes all ambitions for the eurasian union * turkey and russia are n't see eye to eye either . 
   `` it was actually majority russian before the deportation '' no you are wrong , before the mass deportations tartars made up 55 % of the crimea population , now their population makes up 12 % . 
  the meijilis are the only political organization representing the tartars , so when they speak out against the occupation you know something is up . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatars#crimean_tatars )  the ussr annexed karelia but as you know all the finnish citizens left anyway . 
  dude , they left because russia illegally annexed karelia . 
  russia got kicked out of the league of nations because of their invasion . 
  you ca n't just invade a country , ethnically cleanse all their people and claim `` see there are not natives here , its our land '' . 
  during the continuation war finland fought to retake * the land that russia stole .

  if you did n't notice russia 's economy has tanked now , due to economic sanctions and oil ( the us shale industry has increased production which is one of the causes of increased oil prices ) . 
  what is the uk doing ? 
  trying to jump out of the eu and get stuck into another scotland referendum ? 
  by that i think russia means do n't mess with its ** near abroad . 
  ** * russia did the same exact behavior to georgia in the 2008 russo-georgia war when it seeked closer ties to the west , and russia even annexed south ossetia ( part of georgia ) under the guise of pro-russian forces similar to crimea * russia wants to ~ ~ defend its ethnic population abroad ~ ~ protect its sphere of influence . 
  you need to realize that russia can never carry out the structural reform or has the transparency needed to develop industry to compete with europe or the west of the world , thats why its relies mostly on its former ussr members , either through the eurasian customs union which gives russia exclusive access into their economies while putting harsh tarriffs against all others, 
  you realize belarus is suffering alot more than russian from the sanctions ? 
  apparently the rest of the world does n't . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea#others ) does n't help russia 's case when countries like cuba , venezula , and north korea only support your cause . 
  as for the legitmacy of the referedum , i 'm fairly certain north korea has held more transparent ones . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) 96.77 % , really ? 
  seems very ` legitimate ' . 
  the referedum question itself was bias , it either asked to join the russian federation , or restore crimea to the 1992 consitution powers , which both de facto mean crimea is an ` independent state ' ( except being occupied by pro-russian forces ), 
  before , crimea was majority ethnic tartars ( until stalins purges and mass deportations ) , then during the cold war lots of russians emigrated there during the cold war , as it was a military base and such . 
  when the ussr fell lots of russians stayed there . 
  i think you are focusing too much on crimea , remember that the donbass war is still going on in eastern ukraine ? 
  where actual russian troops are engaging in combat against ukrainians . 
  russia did n't like it which chechnyan separatists tried leaving russia , i do n't see how they justify the current response against ukraine . 
  the sanctions were n't so much over crimea but the changing geopolitical games infused by russian foriegn policy . 
  ironically yes , this started off with crimea , but russia has increased its foriegn policy ambitions in syria , as well as militarization near the baltics . 
  i should add that sanctions will be removed if the minsk agreement ( ceasefire in eastern ukraine ) is successfully done , it does n't include anything about crimea specifically, 
  the sad thing is , russia could of reduced alot of its causalities during wwii if they actually focused on fighting nazism , not trying to invade neutral countries ( like finland ) and suffering a quarter of a million causalities . 
  i agree with toreon . 
  you ca n't just mass deport the local population ( for example , the early tartar population in crimea ) and influx it with your own natives and say its apart of your sphere of influence . 
  i assume russia is not giving back finnish karelia which they stole during the second world war ? 
  victims of capitalism ? 
  the vast majority of former soviet states when they ascend to the eu get a large boost in life expectancy , living standards , and gdp per capita, 
  so is russia going to give back karelia which they stole from finland ? 
  i mean crimea was only given back in 1954 , and russia annexed finnish karelia early 1940 . 
  i find the arguement that just because there are russia citizens there means that its okay for russia the ` mother country ' to annex it . 
  but you seem to forget that crimea before was n't majority russian , it was majority tartar before the mass deportations , during the ukraine crisis the tartar crisis spoke out against the annexation and of course were silenced . 
  same goes for the baltics , you can not mass deport the local population , then influx it with your own and claims its ` yours ' now . 
  rip belarus , they 're suffering more from this incident ( and the oil drop ) more than russia, 
  well there 's that , and crimea has great geographic and geopolitical aspects 1 ) it gives russia another warm water port area ( russia is basically a landlocked nation during winter time ) 2 ) lots of oil reserves in the black sea ... especially near crimea , probably one of the reasons sanctions/blocking investments took place in crimea is to discourage and disable russia from being able to develop infrastructure necessary to possible have the oil industry start drilling there 3 ) most likely russia felt unconfrotable that ukraine was wielding too west , same thing happened to georgia in the russo-georgia war in 2008 . 
  russia annex south ossetia from georgia , sortof as they annexed crimea from ukraine . 
  hi , is finland getting karelia any time soon ? 
  during the cold war , finland was actually in a good economic position , being able to trade with the ussr republics and then also europe , the vast majority of trade in finland is within the eurasian contineent , so i do n't see the big deal , plus finland produces 60 % of the worlds icebreakers so i would n't really say we 're ` landlocked ', 
  finland actually has a vibrant agricultural sector ( yes its highly subsidized , but so its switzerlands ) , with the 2014 ukraine crisis , russia put a food embargo on the eu , and finland ships alot of its food there , since the trade block , low priced food has flooded the domestic market cutting profits from the farmers, 
  our gdp growth is slowly improving , yes we are having stagnant growth , but we do n't have massive layoffs , gdp capita decline , any of that , being in the positive gdp growth is something, 
  i think slowly finland is piecing its economy back together , yeah with the whole situation with russia it kindof sank our growth ( again ) but germany and sweden have overtaken it as # 1 trading partner, 
  ... you know ... you can give back finnish karelia if we 're talking about whats rightfully whose . . 
  in a way we kind of see estonia as our lost little brother that was unfortunate to not escape the soviet wrath in wwii . 
  during the cold war , for at least finland , we were able to trade prosperously with both west & east while keeping soviet external forces at bay . 
  good thing / r/russia is n't as active as / r/suomi, 
  hehe , finland 's flag is over with south america, 
  pls no stormaktstiden, 
  :( we have argentina , we do n't need nordic, 
  do you know if there is a specific subreddit that caters to actual russians ? 
  for example , / r/finland is generally more americanized than / r/suomi that is actually finnish . 
  you did us a great honor . 
  banned for asking about modern day russian opinions on the ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
  i 'm curious , is the standard of living in kaliningrad higher than the average place in russia ( excluding moscow/st petersburg ) or is it about the same ? 
  someone please post this on / r/russia , its worth the ban . 
  how dare you attack their beloved rt news of truth,
