  yeah , i posted stuff asking about modern russian opinions towards the soviet union during wwii ( specifically relating to the winter war ) . 
  they tend to get into whataboutism if you bring up false flags and the ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
  seems the [ / r/russia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/61lbnc/dozens_detained_as_opposition_activists_hold/ ) subreddit is going into whataboutism again . 
  and if its not that means its flanking . 
  nationalism/patriotism or whatever you call it played a big roll in both the [ soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_socialist_patriotism ) and the us . 
  i find it laughable that you said there was never much nationalism in the soviet union . 
  if anything people under the censorship and suppression in the soviet union were more `` brainwashed '' than you accuse america of being . 
  and unlike both world wars which were started in europe , the soviet union & usa never formally went to war in the cold war . 
  there were close calls here and there but it never fully escalated to a great power on great power conflict such as the world wars . 
  how so ? 
  bloomberg is an american website , most likely tailored towards an american audience . 
  welcome to reddit . 
  to be fair , nationalism in the united states so far has n't caused any world wars . 
  quite the opposite in europe . 
  rip are economy still, 
  if i recall alot of the sanctions go towards russian banks and further oil exploration in the arctic and siberia , correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  but yes , sanctions certainly wo n't be the deathblow to the russian economy . 
  finnish politics at that time was pretty cooperative , especially at the hands of the soviet union breathing down finlands back , kekkonen had the support of most of the major parties . 
  thats the thing , should we include diseases spread by europeans , which they had a little control over as apart of genocide ? 
  remember , the american colonies were not technically ` american ' yet , they were european migrants from ireland , germany , sweden , england , france , and a whole bunch of other european countries . 
  not exactly sure that would constitute genocide , ethnic cleansing for sure . 
  same argument can be said by the spaniards , or spanish empire in latin america , purposeful genocide or . . what ? 
  we know the spanish at least wanted to include the natives in their society ( through a rigid caste system and christization ) , compare that to the nazi party that did not want to assemblies the jews , even deport them to another homeland , they just wanted to exterminate them period . 
  i think we are just going overboard and bunching every horrible event in human history in one category . 
  just because the us supports authoritarian regimes , which basically every single country that has done imperialism has , does not equate it to the same level of the systematic destruction of a group of people . 
  policies that lead to famine is very different than using a military of a country to directly kill individuals . 
  i 'm sorry but whose fault is that . 
  a century of imperialism followed by globalization how can you not expect the pakistanis , indians , asians , and other parts of the very former british empire to choose to relocate to the uk ` mother country ' . 
  there is a large ` multicultural ' theme of values in australia , new zealand , and canada with little to no relation to the united states , if anything you could argue that the british empire helped spread this anglo culture of inclusiveness . 
  i think its a bit silly to blame the us . 
  ireland shares the english language as well , yet they are still very conservative on issues such as marriage and abortion . 
  seeing that western europe as a whole is alot more liberal than the us , i would be surprised if this did n't happen on its own . 
  erm , so are we going to include the uk for the boer war , indian famine , and american colonization ? 
  as well as the spanish ? 
  go to their [ website ] ( http://static.visionofhumanity.org/#page/indexes/global-peace-index/2016/rus,usa/over ) and you can see it compared to other countries . 
  russia & the us rank basically the same in militarisation , russia just scores poorer on society and interior conflict, 
  i 'm guessing its conflicts in syria & ukraine . 
  iceland seems to score 1.3 for ` militarisation ' , the same as slovenia somehow then, 
  for militarisation iceland then somehow is scored 1.3 , the same as slovenia . 
  no , they have an icelandic coast guard that fulfills the same roll as a defence force . 
  during the cold war and continuing to this day they operate military style equipment such as an [ air defense system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iceland_air_defence_system ) plus iceland was involved in the [ `` cod wars '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars ) with the united kingdom that fulfilled a similar task . 
  not to jump on the bandwagon , but many of the european countries that are ranked high or very high dependent on the us military prowess in one form or another . 
  both denmark & iceland are ranked very high , yet still nato members . 
  i would also like to point out that . 
  many of these european countries that rank high or very high benefit in one form or another from us security and nato . 
  i 'm not icelandic but if iceland was not apart of nato i 'd assume they would beef up their armed forces a bit . 
  i would also like to point out that perhaps the us has a lower score because it bears more of the responsibility of being the ` nato ' leader . 
  i was a bit surprised france was tinted yellow at least . 
  you see many countries with high or very high rankings such as iceland & denmark which are still nato members . 
  damn you netherlands, 
  ** take that neverlands **, 
  except the death rate in those camps were still those below of finnish povs and stalins work camps all across siberia . 
  if you read the article on concentration camps deaths were due to poor harvests from the war , and not systematic execution like the soviets . 
   plus saying that they participated in the siege of leningrad is a stretch . 
  using wikipedia as a source , [ finland stopped in 1941 20km from leningrad . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_leningrad#finnish_participation ) finland did not actually fight during the siege of leningrad despite german requests , they simply defended their pre-winter war mannerheim line area . 
  i think i read somewhere that quality of life is still above immediate post-ussr levels . 
  so it may be bad but its not 1991 - bad . 
  you are taking information from one news headline . 
  and please stop pretending that russia has not been previously guilty of spreading its own form of ideals through populist , isolationist propaganda or earlier communist rhetoric . 
  by using your logic . 
  is n't then russia in the wrong for ` restoring order ' during the chechen wars in stopping the ethnic chechen separatists who wanted independence from russia ? 
  or lets use a more relevant example of kurds wanting kurdistan by taking a large chuck of turkish modern day territory ? 
  would you accept that since its in the name of `` self determination '', 
  russia has a right to secure its border . 
  that means manning both sides, 
  a balance is always nice , finland needed to achieve realpolitik or `` finlandization '' as some would say to not make our land a battleground during the cold war . 
  belarus is an independent black woman who needs no man . 
  rip finland, 
  agreed . 
  you do n't have to look too far into people such as mike pence , and jeff sessions and how religious they are . 
  at least the [ current trend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_united_states#statistics ) the us demographics are becoming more irreligious . 
  i do n't know the religious demographics in ireland but i 'm guessing they have a much smaller irreligious population as per percentage since they are a catholic nation . 
  what makes you say it does n't have separation of church and state ? 
  the us does not endorse any specific religion , whereas article 44 in the irish constitution  the state acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to almighty god . 
  it shall hold his name in reverence , and shall respect and honour religion . 
  1 ) the pledge of allegiance first began during the cold war to separate the us from atheist , communist countries 2 ) its optional in school , you are n't forced to do it . 
  in the us the head of state and head of government are one person , so the president does have to assume a ceremonial role , and again its most likely apart of their culture . 
  the religious part of the inauguration is ceremonial , whereas most european countries have a separate head of state and head of government , in the us is combined into one . 
  and i hope you know that they can opt out of praying on the bible and instead can do it on a law book . 
  you win this time ... 
  certain aspects of their economy such as agriculture and aerospace may be growing but you ca n't ignore the overall gdp decline . 
  instead of firing workers the government told companies to reduce wages instead , which is happening now . 
  overall for the average citizen and the consumer there is nothing really great about it . 
  as soon as ( or somewhere in the future ) when russia does warm relations with the west and removes its counter-sanctions/tariffs on europeans those very same industries such as agriculture and manufacturing will collapse again because it did n't have the government per-emptily limiting foreign competition . 
  sanctions are the icing on top of the cake . 
  sabaton , tyr , nightwish , turisas , korpiklaani , hammerfall , get the whole nordics rocking . 
  here 's a pic of the [ finnish president shoveling snow the day after elections ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zl1sq.jpg ), 
  i think shes already nervous, 
  its a geopolitical standpoint , not a moral one . 
  if in some odd scenario you go to war with a country that you sold weapons too , you know the capability , the strengths , and the weaknesses of their military and their equipment . 
  one example would be iran that fields about 42 american f-4 phantoms and 24 f-14 s. 
  finland takes introversion to the extreme . 
  [ although it does make great infantrymen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war#/media/file:finn_ski_troops.jpg ), 
  rip finnish neutrality , their ` snap exercises ' are bigger than our current active frontline personnel . 
  i think apart of the decision with the f/a -18 was its landing/take off capability , a big portion of fdf 's survivability is to be able to take off from small roads and highways in a likely situation that all airfields are destroyed . 
  not sure if f16 has similar capability or not . 
  the question is not if europe has the capability to defend itself , the question is if its * willing * too . 
  i mean , if the eu actually developed its own centralized military complex then maybe we would n't have to rely on us weaponry . 
  i 'm all for pro-pan-europeanism , but lets not continously throw flake at the us for our inabilities .
