  i 'd assume both the us and european military circles are fully aware of the russian military budget increases . 
  and i 'm not so sure about you , but ever since 2014 with russia 's increasing amounts of ` military readiness ' drills the media certainly has been highlighting military activity under putin . 
  good old boys, 
  airspace incursions really are n't anything new or anything to freight over . 
  [ here 's a list of incursions into finnish airspace ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_defence_force_lists_ten_years_of_airspace_violations/7442575 ) and here you can see sweden is the second biggest ` violator ' after russia . 
  i think we need more context in order to get any real conclusion here before throwing accusations . 
  for example [ here 's a list of airspace incursions in finland ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_defence_force_lists_ten_years_of_airspace_violations/7442575 ) set up by the ministry of defense . 
  here you can see sweden is the second biggest ` violator ' after russia , and it shows the type of aircraft that penetrated finnish airspace for some more context . 
  and you can obviously see in 2014 there was a big increase in russian * military * aircraft . 
  barack obama was n't really a war mongerer , he did n't commit actual troops to ukraine or syria while other presidents would of done it in a heartbeat . 
  there 's impeachment of course . 
  i 'm fairly certain trump wo n't push that far , republicans would probably try impeaching him if he does n't fulfill his role of commander in chief . 
  yes , although i did spend a big portion of my childhood in usa, 
  and that goes to my point that thinking the us will disarm nato is silly, 
  yeah she would of been a lot more hawkish , whether for better or worse is your opinion . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but its fairly normal for the winning candidate to bring their people into their administrative work , its usually many of the staffers that work on the campaign trail . 
  lol yeah , i do n't see how people overlooked this , mike pence actually voted to invade iraq . 
  i doubt the status quo for american military alliances will change under donald . 
  the us president actually does n't have very big legislative power to overturn nato or anything . 
  plus i doubt the war hawks in the republican party want to overturn 60 years of the most powerful military alliance in history . 
  probably would of seen the opposite headlines if clinton won . 
  denmark clearly does n't exist . 
   eastern sweden ** reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee **, 
  we finns like to display our superior animation ability . 
  little odd that the former soviet blocs are n't as high on the atheist poll . . 
  at least ~ ~ eastern sweden ~ ~ finland remains !, 
  a big portion of finns actually are against ever incorporating karelia back into finland . 
  * russia has really let the land go to waste with poverty and lack of industry * it would open a sizable russian minority in the country , and we do n't want a baltic/ukrainian problem with another ethnic minority . 
  i really do n't understand the point of trying to pin us to russia . 
  we have a larger proportion of people with swedish ancestry than russian . 
  even to this day the russian population within finland has remained minimal . 
  you 'd be suprised how many people on websites like stormfront say we are `` non-white '' despite our high proportion of light hair and blue eyes . 
  eastern swedes is a common one . 
  / r/finlandconspiracy or peddling neo-racist conspiracy theories of us being mongoids, 
  usually if you are out in the cottage area certain trees will have markings for you to follow . 
  if not then your best hope is to find a road . 
  can confirm . 
  from finland, 
  why i am reading this, 
  she looks like the female version of skrillex . 
  not the fourth to last one , `` carolann gallon '' i think her name is . 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  hey i mean , germany , the uk , and france could of perfectly picked up the tab . 
  the uk is seeking reparations from the us over dumped tea, 
   the song main idea is that the red army is entering finland to liberate it from capitalists that supressed finnish revolution and now are fooling finnish people . 
  how ironic when the soviet soldiers realized that many finnish farmers had better shoes and clothes than their standard army uniform . 
  again you need to ask yourself , is it better to be apart of the german empire or an ally of it . 
  to warn finland not to make the same mistakes as ukraine , of course . 
  literally 9/10 if finland is mentioned by kremlin officials its to warn us about the tyranny of nato . 
  is it just me or is it weird that every time that vladimir putin/related russian official mentions or even visits finland , they always bring up `` do n't join nato its provocation , russia has been nice by hiding troops away '' sort of talk . 
  i remember posting an article on / r/russia about peoples opinions on the winter war a while back . 
  long story short i got into an argument with a deluded guy who claims russia was defending itself , and that russia `` did n't really want to conquer finland , but protect itself with buffer space '' despite all evidence pointing from the [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact#consequences_in_finland.2c_poland.2c_the_baltic_states_and_romania ) , the [ finnish democratic republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) which was set up as the future puppet government of finland , heck , they even made a [ musical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suite_on_finnish_themes ) for when soviet forces would be marching down helsinki . 
  thank god that sub is dead now . 
  stop lying you fascist . 
  we all know it was ukraine along with cia warmongerers who set up the false flag operation . 
  i read some of the accounts on wiki . 
  this guy is like the version of himmler to hitler . 
  we are higher than netherlands atleast . 
  that requires you to make contact and get within someones personal space . 
  coffee . 
  depression . 
  ftfy, 
  where do you have evidence of this ? 
  you forgot that russia was the one who actually annexed a piece of ukrainian territory . 
  you do n't think there was an economic incentive there to take ukrainians resources ? 
  apparently it is n't profitable for the west because we never sent our militaries there . 
  russia on the other hand is profiting in the conflict because they are directly involved in it . 
  and i do n't know where you get your news from but the war clearly is n't resolved since there is still fighting in eastern ukraine . 
  when did the war in donbass end ? 
  you realize there are videos of russian mechanized units/artillery acrossing and firing across the border to bolster rebel forces . 
  not to mention ukraine has [ captured several russian servicemen ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213 ) who were in combat roles . 
  is the ukraine war over ? 
  i 'm just saying , is any ( heterosexual ) male in europe really complaining that there are more females than males ? 
  seeing the issues india/china has regarding gender imbalance favoring men i do n't really need to complain . 
  i think what op originally meant was around since there are more female teachers there are more female role models for girls to follow than compared to men . 
  there 's also an argument that male/female teachers perhaps teach in different formats that either benefit girls/boys . 
  this is just from my personal experience . 
  but some of the `` trouble makers '' in my class were more disruptive/lacked respect for many of the female teachers , but they were more concern treated and involved in classes with a strict , masculine , male teacher that made sure they stayed on task .

  in russia the border is manned on both sides . 
  as others have pointed out about keeping buffer zones from nato , i must add that crimea served a good propaganda purpose after `` reuniting crimea '' and then making sevestapol a recognized federal city . 
  the crimea coast ( along with its russian military base ) gives russia more access and land on the black sea and out to the mediterranean . 
  russia already has a developed `` military-industrial complex '' though . 
  russia already has the technical know how and experience to create air , land , sea , rocket equipment . 
  some european countries have to import or put a ton of money into r&d for military equipment . 
  finland strikes again . 
  does that mean i 'm a stateless refugee ? 
  time to seek welfare in sweden !, 
  i 'm just saying , using armed drones in immigration related consequences sets a bad precedence for armed drones ... certainly in other areas such as immigration in north america . 
  most human traffickers are n't even on the boats . 
  they just take the migrants money , appoint one of the migrants as a `` driver '' of their dingy and poor motor , and set them on their way all on the safety of the shore . 
  `` fen lan '' ... well close enough, 
  its like the same reason that the us has a naval base on haiwaii , it has a deep harbor nearby , something that crimea has also . 
  you are also omitting the fact that russia still had a naval based leased in crimea . 
  would n't make sense to build a whole new black sea fleet hq when you can literally retake one established during the ussr . 
  sweden is a dick and finland has some balls . 
  gg netherlands,
