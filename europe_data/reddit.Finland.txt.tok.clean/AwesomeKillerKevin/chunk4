  finland and sweden are independent countries who can choose their own foriegn policy . 
  if finland or sweden join nato , that would not be aggressive or hostile , its simply countries protecting themselves from russian intimidation . 
  not finland 's problem that russia has no friends . 
  i do n't really think the us would leak this . 
  concerning us military companies have a billion dollar contract putting the electronics and software into the new submarines for australia . 
  plus i think the us is hoping that with these new submarines australia will take a more aggressive role in the south china sea against china, 
  why not just call an early election and get it over with ? 
  russia will have to go through cost-benefit analysis if it wants to go to war . 
  you can just look at the soviet invasion of afghanistan , numeral superiority does n't mean shit if you do n't accomplish your goals . 
  if russia was in a total war scenario where it wanted to destroy finland no matter the cost . 
  we would probably lose if we did n't have allies . 
  point being is there is little benefit in getting in a full blown war with finland . 
  either way , its non-binding . 
  but its a good step seeing that sweden signed a similar deal earlier . 
  it at least makes it clear who 's side we are on . 
  you can just go on sputnik or rt news and see their orientation against sweden and finland . 
  alot of the russian media is oriented to domestic consumption , not exactly on spaking the truth . 
  here 's a article by yle in english about putin 's visit to finland . 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/putins_comment_about_location_of_russian_troops_baffles/9000152 putin purposely speaks to make out finland and sweden has the ` aggressors ' if we decide to get closer ties to western security organizations . 
  here putin says an outright lie , everyone knows its totally false , but he said that statement to feed the propaganda for russian news agencies at home . 
  this is horrible . 
  people really need to think about the real life implications of doing this stuff . 
  just because it sounds good on paper does n't mean its pretty . 
  pretty sure all those other beach goers were going wtf just leave her alone . 
  the brits built boston . 
  take that america . 
  is n't the us your biggest trade partner ? 
  ( country ) not to shit on nz though but the majority of their trade is lamb meat and milk . 
   `` plucky little poland '' ow . 
  why would they target him though ? 
  i do n't understand . 
   `` we built you roads , apartments , factories , schools and kindergartens '' we get the some bs sometimes to finland . 
  after two waves of russification we had enough and wanted independence . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_foreign_and_security_policy i do n't see why it can not have similar structures to nato . 
  even with eu peacekeeping missions and the eu battle groups , individual nations contributed troops are commanded by officers of host country . 
  dunno man , 78 % of the uk economy is in the service sector . 
  not being the world 's largest financial hub is a big blow . 
  challenge accepted . 
  its similar to the situation between china-russia . 
  both putin and the premier of china play and act as ` equals ' but we all damn well know russia need 's china more than china needs russia . 
  r probably the only critical voice is the communist party , and they only complain about pensions and veterans . 
  all of the other parties , whether they be the liberal democratic party basically all fall in line with putin 's current foriegn policy visions . 
  like whom exactly ? 
  rip afghanistan loyalty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea#others, 
  when did i say us technology was superior ? 
  i was arguing in the first place it was more widely used instead and that needs to change . 
   for same reason us had to use british jump jets bullshit . 
  you realize the harrier was a joint venture between the us and uk developed by british aerospace and mcdonell douglas with bae systems and boeing . 
   because it 's navy is literally incapable of using anything else to the way they want to design their carriers defense secretary philip hammond that only around 48 of the f-35b 's would be fitted onto the carriers . 
  even so , the uk is n't going to purchase 138 expensive fighters just to fit its navy , most of the other aircraft are going to the royal airforce . 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_cm_9161_nss_sd_review_web_only.pdf  another straight forward lie . 
  you really need to read before you type . 
  i was not wrong that the rafale fighter is expensive compared to the f-16 . 
  if you want to compare multirole jets with naval capability you can just compare it to the f/a -18 which still has a unit cost of 29 million ( 2006 ) compared to the dassault rafale . 
  in many respects the rafale fighter is more comparable to the f-18 . 
  even so , its expense is still hindering . 
  only france and egpyt currently operate it , india and qatar have them on order in small numbers too . 
  it would make more sense if all the european countries banded together on a single aircraft . 
  the typhoon is a good match until its replacement . 
  in all honesty how exactly is britain suppose to be a pacifist isolationist ? 
  you guys are practically reliant on the sea for trade and security . 
  i do n't know why you think i 'm a us shill . 
  i 'm in favor of european countries co-developing their own equipment for standardization . 
  it would be easier if we produced the same equipment besides having 28 different equipment for 28 different armed forces . 
   except they do n't . 
  brits use eurofighter typhoons as their primary fighter except now the uk is ordering a total of 138 f-35b fighters to be the core of our fighter strength . 
  removing the panavia tornadoes and sidelining the typhoons . 
  the uk is also purchasing anti-submarine airborne equipment from the us . 
  the french and germans do domestic more of their air force . 
  my original point was it , would be better if europe standardized its own domestic equipment so we would n't waste the cost . 
  france 's dassault rafale fighter costs nearly 74 million euros as a runaway cost in some sales . 
  its very expensive compared to the f-16 's 18 million runaway cost . 
  and both of those aircraft have equal if not slightly different performances . 
  europe does have some commonalities with its equipment , virtually every european country uses some form of the leopard tank, 
  i meant military aircraft , f16s and f/a -18 hornets dominate the air forces of europe . 
  the united states no doubt was the one holding up nato during the cold war and now in the 21st century . 
  nearly all nato missions have been us initiated with exemptions like france . 
  with germany , france ~ ~ uk ~ ~ not willing to increase the tab it looks like the us will remain the pincer of the security . 
  a great irony is , the majority of interoperability between european forces is using common us military equipment ( whether it be fighter aircraft or anti air craft systems ) . 
  if we ever are going to get to an `` eu army '' stage we need to develop a common military complex and not have each 28 members manufacturing their own types of military arms . 
  luckily most polls consistently have hillary clinton beating trump . 
  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html i 'm not an expert on the electoral college but the vibe in / r/politics is trump is going to have a giant uphill battle . 
  can you imagine how pissed the united states and the european countries would be after the uk ** not only wrecks the credibility of the eu , but nato as well . 
  rip , northern european countries are more ` left ' than the typical western country and even our most left politicians do n't go gerrymandering with the russians . 
  finland can not into union ;(,

  what, 
  * ireland intensifies *, 
  i have brown eyes ;(, 
  source ? 
  all i know about blue eyes is its a recessive gene, 
  that , and probably because people are more open to report sexual assaults ( which is a good thing ) . 
  if you look at middle eastern countries the ` reported rapes ' to police is deplorable in comparison . 
  finland , the land of forests and lakes, 
  yeah , i just troll on / r/conspiracy and post conspiracies about non-western countries and donald trump . 
  you got to admit though , some of the stuff that happened in the aftermath of 1999 apartment bombings is ** sketchy as fuck ** not mistakes made by news outlets on air or something , but actual mistakes by the government and intelligence service . 
  pretty sketchy just reading the wiki wage . 
  do n't icelanders and finns now have the largest proportion of blond hair blue eye folk nowdays ?
