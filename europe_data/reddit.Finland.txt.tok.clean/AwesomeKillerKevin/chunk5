  is n't it already established that the majority of refugees are going through land routes , not sea . 
  plus there are way way more refugees coming to europe compared to australia, 
  1 ) bigger distance between the migrants coming to australia 2 ) pretty sure there are way more refugees coming to europe than australia, 
  i blame the blond northern european girls . 
  i think we should all stop dicking around . 
   politics 101, 
  ** rt news is not the official view **, 
  add turkey and its a kebab fest, 
  if you want the russian interpretations and judgements , watch russia channal one , russia 1 , ntv , or rossiya segodnya . 
  watch actual russian domestic cable news or online . 
  please do n't go around watching rt news and claiming you are an expert on the russian interpretation . 
  you are n't going to get any meaningful information reading the english version of `` russian news '' . 
  you are better off google translating text from actual russian channels , not propaganda arms . 
  rt news barely peddles the official russian perspective , only if it is anti-western or anti-american, 
  rt news is ** directed ** to be foriegn propaganda press . 
  cnn , the guardian , dw , and others are n't . 
  its equivalent to the united states propaganda arm `` voice of america '' during the cold war . 
  you are better off watching local russian news if you want to hear about russian domestic policy or what vladimir putin is doing . 
  rt news was directly created to pander and influence audiences in the west . 
  rt does n't even properly cover domestic news in russia . 
  it just has a circle jerk of a section called `` russian politics '', 
  yeah , i read alot of articles saying that people are ` covering up more ' and in my personal experience top coverage is still considered more the ` norm ' although its not frowned upon if you go topless . 
  could you give an example of where they reported well ? 
  lol , rt news is complete bullshit , i do n't see how you can get any information from them . 
  the only thing i applause them for is their short video clips on youtube, 
  i always assumed the internet attracts a large amount of idiots and conspiracy theorists . 
  exactly how common is topless sunbathing in france currently ? 
  i heard it was on the decline for some reason . 
  well , there were actual russian drills against gotland , have n't heard of any aimed at aland, 
  you would have more access if you occupied gotland . 
  do n't see very much use for it seeing that russia already directly borders russia . 
  if they wanted to threaten/attack use they would n't need to waste the time and money capturing aland , setting up a military base to attack us on the west . 
  there 's very little need for us to rush any military zone in \u00c5land , norway has the svalbard island in the article directly above it and it is n't militarized . 
  adding a military base on aland would n't be economical or really improve defense , coastal defense in turku can basically already respond to aland . 
  if russia even planned on taking aland it would be a trip wire between finland and sweden . 
  gotland if anything would be more of value . 
  guantanamo bay or execution ? 
  some of them were soviet submarines , others were ~ ~ nato ~ ~ us submarines in which sweden-us cooperated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_submarine_incidents, 
   if we were forced to take the soviet route, 
  yeah , the swedish hc probably knew this already by heart , they did give a ton of military equipment * 15,000 volunteers * 135,402 rifles , 347 machine guns , 450 light machine guns with 50,013,300 rounds of small arms ammunition ; * 144 field guns , 100 anti-aircraft guns and 92 anti-armour guns with 301,846 shells ; * 300 sea mines and 500 depth charges ; 17 fighter aircraft , 5 light bombers , 1 dc-2 transport aircraft turned into bomber , and 3 reconnaissance aircraft , totally comprising 1/3 of the swedish air force at the time . 
  yeah i 'm talking about defense , aland does n't have the capacity for its population size to have a real military , although it could have a defense agreement with sweden or finland if it becomes independent . 
  would be much better if aland remained either in finland or sweden . 
  it would be a nightmare for defense planning if russia somehow chooses to land men in there . 
  * there are no swedes in finland , only little white men *, 
  denmark and sweden geographically are in a good situation where that cooperation can happen . 
  well fuck . 
  an entire generation could potentially be raised in the uk where they are left in this limbo . 
   ** two weeks after signing a war pact with neighboring finland , sweden has made a similar deal with another scandinavian neighbor , denmark . 
  ** while the deal is set to be confirmed later in march , swedish defense minister peter hultqvist stressed that the agreement will not bring neutral sweden any closer to joining nato in the face of increased russian aggression that is worrying scandinavian nations . 
  to be honest nonbinding bilateral defense cooperation treaties do n't mean anything when real military conflict occurs . 
  the other nordics tend to shy away from finland due to our proximity to russia . 
  do the swedes even want aland back ? 
  homeschooling is banned in sweden , and in finland aland gets the ability to opt out of the finnish circular and homeschool . 
  sweden no doubt would of been dragged into wwii as finland did . 
  finland tried copying the same exact policy as sweden , did n't work at the end . 
  if finland fell to the soviets , ussr finland directly borders nazi norway , and is near the precious iron ore mines in sweden that germany depended on importing . 
  iceland was occupied by the allies , denmark and norway the nazis , and finland played geopolitics switching from fighting against the soviets alone , then with the germans , then having to fight the germans off our land . 
  did n't sweden have a pack with the us during the cold war ? 
  pretty sure thats how all those submarines mysteries started . 
  i honesty believe if finland fell to the ussr in talvisota and became an occupied territory like the baltics , sweden would be dragged into war itself . 
  geographically if you look on the map finland was protecting sweden 's eastern flank . 
  finland borders nazi norway and is near the iron ore mines which germany depends on , if finland fell to the soviets no doubt sweden would be put in the crossfire between the ussr and nazi germany . 
  for finland nazi germany was the lesser of two evils compared to the soviet union . 
  it was the right choice seeing that germany eventually got toppled . 
  if we were forced to take the soviet route as the baltics did we would lose 50 some years of being independent . 
  in all honesty nobody is really `` neutral . '', 
  even in wwii sweden had to give in to some of the germans demands , and they provided weapons/volunteers to help finland in talvisota against russia which i am thankful for . 
  even through the cold war sweden maintained a close working relationship with the us, 
  uk has n't officially left yet . 
  according to the uk it could take til 2017 or worst case 2019 . 
  i like your desert uniform/green vest combinations, 
  11 million ` illegal ' immigrants in the us already ? 
  sanitation can be an issue , although albeit not at the beach . 
  i 'd assume the stuff he released on the dnc was true seeing that several high ranking members quit . 
  i 'm not actually sure how if someone is confirmed reliable , i 'd assume someone has to admit it . 
  so much for enjoying the sun and water on your skin . 
  she is even more pro-russian than putin in some respects . 
  thats how diplomacy works . 
  you do n't see these ceasefires work for no reason . 
  same thing for the eu-turkey refugee deal , foreign governments have to lobby . 
  he definitely has something to dig against hillary clinton . 
  i 'm not saying he should n't release anything that is true , but he is very easygoing around russia and donald trump, 
  news media is n't the problem . 
  there will always be western/conspiracy biases . 
  the issue is the freedom to access the information . 
  in the us and the western world you can easily view anything you want , even news from other countries . 
  in the us they give rt news their own freakin tv channel . 
  the issue is in these countries that highly regulate the media such as russia , that since 2014 have mainly banned foriegn and independent news networks . 
  they 'll manage , but it really puts a hole in the whole modernization program . 
  probably the area suffering the most is the navy . 
  i just think this is just pr for a `` new leaf to turn '' which happens every time a new government is formed . 
  the more i think about it the more i think this is just pr . 
  even on the security issue the uk and russia are n't inter-lapping in any way , and the uk is n't heavily involved in syria as the us is for example . 
  so much for russia trying to move `` east '', 
  it would be a big risk for ~ ~ russia ~ ~ gazprom to do it alone . 
  like the article said without widespread approval it could scare investors . 
  and the current oil situation is n't exactly making it profitable . 
  i 'm no expert on uk-russia relations but what exactly do uk and russia have to cooperate on ? 
  you two do n't have very large trade volumes if i 'm correct . 
  rip , i wish i still had access to / r/russia .
