  is it just me or does it just feel like only rt viewers and conspiracy theorists are on that subreddit than actual russians ? 
  do you go there at all ? 
  in all honesty i think this is just more pr than anything actual . 
  similar to when trudeau of canada said they were doing so with russia too . 
  dear italy , please do the bidding of your ancestors and take over britannia, 
  depends on how far they mean `` normalization . '', 
  its perfectly fine for the uk to have day to day relations as finland has with russia on a daily basis . 
  but yeah , the uk dropping sanctions would cross the line . 
  rip ~ ~ neutral ~ ~ sweden, 
   eurasian union i thought britain did n't want to be apart of the mainland europe , now they 're opting for mainland eurasia ? 
  depends on exactly the uk means to do . 
  a lot of the sanctions on russia stop russia from getting necessarily loans and technologies for future oil exploration and military equipment . 
  i 'm no expert in uk-russia relations but you two do n't seem to have really deep trade relations . 
  shame we still have it . 
  sanctions act as a double whammy on the russian economy . 
  they can not take loans from western banks , they can not get funding for future russian oil exploration ( going to suck seeing that russia 's oil situation is n't improving ) and russia can not import western technology in which some of its military requires . 
  sanctions have n't really only hit the poor , although i agree they are paying a high price . 
  sanctions make it nearly impossible for russia to import the capital , technology , and expertise needed in much of its military equipment and oil exploration . 
  sanctions are the double whammy on the oil price drop . 
  russia can not get loans from the west to ease its economic troubles , and it ca n't import western technology and expertise , in areas such as russian military and oil technology . 
  sanctions are having the effect they are suppose to . 
  with low oil prices , no funding from the western world , and lack of technology russia has nearly halted all of its future oil exploration . 
  sanctions are n't meant for the short-term impact . 
  russia is stagnant and china is undergoing economic reforms to change from a manufacturing to service economy like us . 
  i would n't call it before it happens , the us still has a bigger defense budget than the top 10 nations combined . 
  middle easterners sure have good coffee , that 's something finns can get behind . 
  why the fuck would you even go to the beach . 
  no use in getting tanned or feeling the sun . 
  no really, 
  hey come on :( we were n't worthless https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war, 
  even belarus is trying to postpone housing russian air force bases in its territory . 
  the uk has been one of the core hardliners against russia when it was in the eu . 
  you guys are practically america 's sheriff in europe, 
  ;( remember the mainila, 
  the only reason russia pays attention to us is to make sure we do n't join nato with sweden . 
  well this brings back [ bad memories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ) ;( remember the mainila, 
  well this brings back [ bad memories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ), 
  at least you beat russia . 
  ( even ukraine is beating russia ), 
  poor syria, 
  guess what , finland is # 1, 
   you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time , but you can not fool all the people all the time . 
  sooner or later people in russia will stop accepting the `` fortress russia '' narrative . 
  i disagree , clinton may not have a full war pledged policy towards russia but definitely she would be more hawkish than obama on russia , especially in relations to russia in syria . 
  the west has already shown it would not commit military force to save ukraine , the second best option we are doing now is to make every escalation russia does ever so more painful and permanent . 
  sooner or later the average russian is not going to accept the `` fortress russia '' narrative when things continue to go bad for daily life and the economy . 
   * you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time , but you can not fool all the people all the time . 
  i may point out this will further desecrate ukraine 's naval capability and give russia more control of the black sea . 
  shelling of manila anyone ? 
  the us was a major economic player after the industrial revolution . 
  not sure , only euro skeptic i know that actually gets loans from russian banks is the french national front . 
  i would n't exactly say russia is directly responsible for euroscepticism operations or brexit . 
  but it certainly does try push it along and tip the balance when need be . 
  finland is currently building a lng terminal in hamina as well . 
  in all honesty though in the current shape of the ukrainian military i do n't think they could even successfully attempt anything like this . 
  the glue holding nato together is the united states . 
  the us accounts for over 70 % of its budget , and is really the only other superpower to make russia double think its decisions . 
  as long as the us starts threatening and hauling the asses of the other nato members we should all be fine . 
  the sad thing probably the only person who would care or do something is the united states ( assuming clinton gets into office ) . 
  as usual its the us hauling everyone 's asses to the frontline . 
  either this is just a russian military drill aimed at intimidation and ukraine is blowing this over or something serious is going to happen . 
  * shivers * please dont bring back the memories, 
  whoops , i mistyped . 
  i meant the ** f-4 phantom ** [ ( see operators . 
  ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcdonnell_douglas_f-4_phantom_ii#operators ), 
  when the united states starts freaking out then rest assured we should be worried as well . 
  or either the us is keeping their frustration quiet behind closed doors . 
  there is still way to much in stake for turkey . 
  the eu is still its biggest export market , it worked hard to get into an eu customs union . 
  and the us is still the primary supplier of turkey 's big ticket military hardware whether it be literally the entire turkish airforce made up of f-22 phantoms or f-16s or the numerous m60 main battle tanks . 
  russia may be appealing for its autocratic , strongman nature but even erdogan knows turkey can not replace the west as turkey 's main economic , political , and security partner . 
  i do n't think erdogan is just going to jump off a bridge of putin . 
  the eu is still turkey 's biggest market , and the us supplies turkey with the majority of its big ticket items such as the f-16 jet or f-22 phantom or m60 mbt . 
  the vast majority of expensive hardware of the turkish military comes from the united states . 
  whether it be the f16 jet or m60 patton tank . 
  i 'm not so sure turkey wants to compromise top knotch military equipment for just relying on russia 's . 
  plus the eu is still turkeys biggest export market . 
  alright this is taking it way to far . 
  genuinely concerned now . 
  nordic countries already have that . 
  we have free movement with the `` nordic passport '' but the fact of the matter is english is the de facto bussiness language so of course its useful to learn , and i assume russian is second because they are our largest neighbor and a big trading partner . 
  * -- alexander iii . 
  * not sure they had an air force back then . 
  aland is an `` autonomous '' region within finland . 
  basically they are exempt from conscription and can keep the swedish as their government/business language tongue . 
  that and its very hard for mainland finnish people to buy property there . 
  basically a mini-swedish speaking area with their own autonomy . 
  [ deletes post ], 
  there 's alot of support for removing mandatory swedish , problem is of course is the swedish peoples party is a critical piece in the coalition governments . 
  russia only has two allies : army and navy, 
  not necessarily russian , but swedish is n't as useful as it was before , time can be spent more learning another language . 
  problem is of course , it has been one of our ` official languages ' for a while and some people think if we remove swedish we lose our `` nordic heritage '', 
  [ * shivers * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ), 
  i never said that . 
  i just said that particular instance * was * devastating . 
  still pretty devastating . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war english wiki, 
  [ finland stronk ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/3113351/finland-be-afraid-be-very-afraid ), 
  it would be pretty funny if the bridge * mysteriously * collapsed halfway through the project . 
  probably pocketed money .
