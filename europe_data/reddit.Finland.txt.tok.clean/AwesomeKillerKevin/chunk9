  nobody expects ukraine to be eu material within a year . 
  if turkey is having this many problems gaining entry in the eu it is no surprise that ukraine has hills to climb as well . 
  if we are using current ukraine crisis as an example . 
  its fair to say crimea is officially `` annexed '' by russia and integrated into russian political governance . 
  during the early stages of the euromaidan , you can say crimea was occupied by ~ ~ russian troops ~ ~ pro-russians rebels until the referendum results . 
  can we just leave it at both nazi germany and the soviet union had imperialistic goals and set each other in their sights ? 
  do n't need to draw this up . 
  it still does not justify russia invading eastern europe , more or less russia used the molotov ribbentrop just to justify their own imperialistic means . 
  i would argue a nazi-soviet pact would of been more beneficial to the ussr than any western one . 
  both nazi germany and the ussr had a pretty big anti-capitalist agenda . 
  and germany allowed the soviet union to continue its expansion unmolested . 
  hey its alright . 
  they tried to `` liberate '' us too . 
  great irony is when finland was neutral and the ussr invaded they just pushed us closer to germany . 
  came to bite them in the ass during the eastern front . 
  there were alot of news articles . 
  i should say ** less refugees * have come to * europe * not specifically traveling to europe . 
  due to the deal probably more of them are stuck in turkey or in north africa . 
  we are n't experiencing the storm we had in 2016 .

  did n't turkey ask for 3 billion ? 
  i ca n't remember if the 3 billion is the total amount or the amount already given to turkey . 
  its worked pretty well actually . 
  the numbers have dropped significantly . 
  lots of money . 
  the eu would unilaterally recognize the armenian genocide and have closer relations with armenia . 
  i would argue the us beats europe in many cases , including freedom of speech . 
  http://www.thebestschools.org/features/100-best-universities-in-world-today/ the top 3 universities are american . 
  and the us has the highest proportion of colleges in top 100 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending the us spends the most on research and development . 
  but in terms of gdp per capita , the nordics tend to spend more . 
  we can say europe is in a `` state of emergency '' and say we must `` postpone '' visa 's for turks . 
  that would really piss of erdogan 's hypocrisy . 
  the eu needs a common military industrial complex . 
  the problem is the majority of power wielding countries such as germany , france , uk want to use their own military equipment because it facilities their own jobs and `` national prestige '' of owning their own military equipment . 
  even though it is alot more expensive for each nation to individually make their own weapons than pooling together . 
  the us arguably has the most effective military industrial complex , thats why virtually the entire european airforce is reliant on us combat aircraft and air defense systems . 
   france/germany/uk are waffling on baltic and eastern european security germany , the uk , and the france are lopsidedly the most powerful countries in europe , it makes sense that they drive the majority of the security policy seeing they have the majority of the capability to do so . 
  and the baltics and poland are in the eu too ? 
  turkey is the gateway from the third world middle east to europe . 
  we would just be inviting an even bigger refugee crisis . 
  and give russia the gateway for the third world to europe ? 
  do you want a bigger refugee crisis ? 
  cooperation is more due to geopolitics than an actual real alliance . 
  both iran and russia are competing for oil shares in europe . 
  / r/burned, 
  at most i would think russia would continue to intimidate and try to fracture the baltics . 
  i think the russians are a little too crazy to try to actually invade in this day and age . 
  the baltics are definitely a success story to live by . 
  sadly the other ussr states were n't quick enough on the gun to make it into the western sphere before russia took hold on what was going on . 
  but north or the rural areas are n't very population , but the major cities are pretty populated , by finnish standards . 
  finland has a pretty diverse and innovative economy , the problem is marketing . 
  finnish people are some of the most introverted in the world . 
  we appreciate our own personal space . 
  spoken like a true finn . 
  seeing that the vast majority , if not all nuclear weapons used in the nuclear sharing treaties are american , not so sure the us would take kindly to that . 
  as far as i know us nuclear weapons on host countries operate by us rules , not the host countries . 
  well you need to consider two things when nuclear sharing . 
  1 ) that the host country itself has a capable military and the training/facilities to maintain them . 
  2 ) you have strategic depth for the nuclear weapons , so conventional forces can not overwhelm it . 
  in all fairness , if you put nuclear weapons in estonia or poland , where there is active provocations by russia not to mention how close they are , it would be more of a danger . 
  it would be alot harder for russia to do `` hybrid warfare '' to take over the nuclear silos in germany or italy than it would with a country like estonia that already has a small conventional forces . 
  again , nuclear weapons are nuclear weapons , putting them closer to the russian border strategically wo n't do anything better . 
  if you have no evidence then there is no reason for you to be enticing these conspiracy theories . 
  i said the us should n't of taken sides but they did . 
  during the coup both obama and vice president joe biden called for all parties to `` support the democratically elected government of turkey '' ( aka erdogan ) . 
  again if you have no evidence that the us knew beforehand , do n't even entertain the idea . 
  even the prime minister of turkey binali yildirim [ rejects the idea of the us being involved in the coup attempt . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/turkish-pm-coup-suspects-testimony-points-to-gulens-involvement ) its not `` common knowledge '' that he is close to the cia . 
  if it is common knowledge please provide the adequate sources . 
   here 's bill clinton thaking him for example did you even watch the video ? 
  it was apart of a turkish and american cultural exchange . 
  and the video was taken apparently in 2008 , that is nearly 5 years before gulen and erdogan had their falling out in 2013 . 
   here 's an great article about him again , its just an article . 
  not a primary source , the whole thing is just up played coincidences . 
  and truth be told , i have reservations about the source you used `` new eastern outlook '' or commonly known as the institute of oriental studies of the russian academy of sciences . 
  i think they have an inherent anti-american bias and are prone to conspiracy theories . 
  here 's another recent article of theirs claiming that [ `` pokemon go '' is a cia surveillance plot ] ( http://journal-neo.org/2016/07/29/pokemon-go-the-cia-totalitarianism-and-the-future-of-surveillance/ ), 
  please provide evidence that the us had knowledge beforehand of the coup and that gulen is close to the us government/cia . 
  what makes you think the us knew about the coup beforehand ? 
  the us is not the all seeing eye . 
  russia has an economy the size of spain . 
  and spain has nearly half of the population of russia . 
  so yeah, 
  also say eu has better human rights and better economy yet russia stronk, 
  well norway might give finland a mountain for our 100th birthday . 
  ... secret intentions ? 
  `` greater norway '', 
  wants eu membership and the eu is a model for human rights yet wants to be like russia . 
   all countries are enemies 3,0 % well  nato countries 2,9 % good work nato, 
  i 'm sorry to burst your bubbles but i 'm pretty sure erdogan knew about the coup too . 
  i think he knew a little * too much * about it . 
  after a coup it takes more than 24 hours for someone to get a list of * thousands * of people to purge . 
  in my opinion erdogan is using this coup as an excuse to purge all of his political opponents . 
  and by * suspending * the eu human rights clause is n't really painting erdogan in a good light . 
  stop complinaing that the us knew about the coup unless you provide evidence . 
  the fact is * the coup lasted less than 24 hours , the situation was well under control before any reasonable us forces could even intervene * erdogan ** did not request ** nato or us to intervene on his behalf * while the actual coup was happening , the us and other european countries pleaded for support for the democratically elected government of turkey ( aka erdogan ), 
  knowing about the coup and helping directly is two different things . 
  it would of actually been the smart thing to do if the us knew about the coup and did n't intervene on either side . 
  why on earth would they be backed by us islamist terrorists ? 
  proof ?
