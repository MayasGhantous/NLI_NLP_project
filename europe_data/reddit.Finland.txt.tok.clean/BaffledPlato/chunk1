balancing the budget by 2017 , for instance . 
   certainly he has spoken of controlling the budget deficit - bringing it to zero by 2017 is the manifesto pledge . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17978114 i believe he afterwards tried to claim he would only balance the budget if growth returned , but that was still a dangerous pledge to make . 
  people remember the failed promise , not the caveats behind it . 
  i think hollande had unrealistic expectations put upon him - helped , in part , by his unrealistic campaign promises . 
  now his base is alienated . 
  i do n't see how he will win the next election . 
  the french economy will take a while to turn around no matter what he does . 
  well , it 's got to be special . 
  a big budget movie for finland is like a tiny indie project in california . 
  we do n't have the money to compete with standard studio offerings , so it has to be something different . 
  i think a lot of countries are this way . 
  finland is pretty good at dark , violent humour that does n't take itself seriously , which is a nice niche . 
  i know it is a british paper , but are they perhaps using ` gas ' in the american sense of ` gasoline ' ? 
  i think all of our petroleum fuels come from russia . 
  true . 
  i think there is also one up north among the sami . 
  but they do n't seem to be very popular . 
  well , the question was about internal regional disputes . 
  if you want to talk about russia karelia , yeah , there is a problem . 
  but there are no disputes between finnish karelia and the rest of the country . 
  is this a newer phenomenon ? 
  i really do n't recall hearing much about this until the last couple of years . 
  now i 'm hearing it a lot . 
  i think probably every country has internal regional disputes to some extent . 
  some are serious ( independence movements ) and some are not ( football rivalry ) . 
  here in finland we do n't have anything really serious . 
  there are some disputes regarding the native swedish-speaking areas , like the autonomous \u00c5land islands or various communities on the western and southern coasts . 
  swedish is an official language and taught in schools , even though most native finnish speakers would never use it . 
  also , \u00c5land has a few privileges due to its autonomy . 
  so there is a bit of controversy at times over various issues , but nothing really major , i think . 
  finland was kind of in a strange situation , perched between east and west . 
  yet while government and business looked both ways , culturally we seemed to definitely look west . 
  we had some of the same cultural phenomena as other western countries , like with hippies and social protest and a love of rock music . 
  however , i would say it was much less pronounced and had less of an social impact than in other countries . 
  we were poorer than most of western europe but most of us did n't realise it . 
  i mean , there were some trade restrictions at various times , but there was no real deprivation . 
  for instance , if you wanted us style blue jeans you could get them easily enough , but your mother might put a lot of patches in their knees because they had to last . 
  president kekkonen was extremely popular among the people , although he was very close to being a strongman of sorts . 
  democracy was carefully used and abused -- for instance , the route to political success was your closeness to kekkonen . 
  we even cancelled an election and just appointed him as president at one point because he did n't feel like campaigning again . 
  it is a bit uncomfortable to look back on some of the things that happened . 
  but it is important to remember this happened because we were worried about the soviets . 
  they liked kekkonen , and he was able to keep them in check . 
  we were generally wary of the soviet union , but not exactly terrified . 
  our companies did a lot of business over there , and during one bad economic recession i had some family members go to work in construction around leningrad . 
  i remember them laughing about the quality of soviet construction when they got back . 
  we had ladas and other products . 
  i still have a very nicely made soviet tea set . 
  it is n't a shoddy product at all , so defies common stereotypes about soviet consumer products . 
  there was self-censorship in the press about the soviets , but people were happy to tell their buddies how much they hated the russians . 
  there was no culture of fear , really , although i do have a vague memory of people being careful around some places in helsinki the kgb or stasi agents were rumoured to hang out . 
  actually , i am very ashamed to admit this , but i 've never been to riga . 
  but i have heard many good things about it . 
  tallinn is gorgeous . 
  it is my favourite city in the baltic . 
  not only is the architecture great , the shopping is cheap , the service is good and the beer is delicious . 
  kind of reminds me of jane fonda going to north vietnam and [ posing with an anti-aircraft gun ] ( http://www.1stcavmedic.com/jane_fonda/jane-fonda-gun-72.jpg ) . 
  i 'd pick f1 champ [ mika h\u00e4kkinen ] ( http://www.formula1.com/photos/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame_profile/top_right/hof_profile_right_40.jpg ) . 
  i 've always had the impression he could throw the fuck down if he had a mind too . 
  no offense , but if you are going to try and argue that you know more about this than a head of government actually engaged in these negotiations then you will have to do better than that . 
   what gives you the idea that public health services would be excepted ? 
  the prime minister of finland says they are : http://www.alexstubb.com/?p=402 [ google translated into english ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.alexstubb.com%2f%3fp%3d402&amp;edit-text= ), 
   juncker , 59 , told parliament he would present details of his ... 300-billion-euro ( $ 380-billion ) plan for investment to bolster growth and jobs by the end of this year ... 
  so this plan will not only be formulated , agreed-upon and implemented , but it will have already started to work in about two months ? 
  i find that difficult to believe . 
  ** edit ** i think i was reading that wrong . 
  jobs and growth wo n't come by the end of this year - it will be the plan itself . 
  my bad . 
   much of the 300 billion euros should come from private investors so this is n't even eu funds , for the most part . 
  who is this money going to come from , and what is in it for them ? 
   the eu 's budget rules that limit the size of government deficits and public debt will not be weakened so there is no shift in policy , at least so far . 
  they will still have to figure out what to do about france ( and maybe others ) ignoring the budget limits . 
  no , a friend on fb shared it from someone i 've never heard of . 
  another person reposted this on / r/pics and a poster there [ claimed to know the author ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2jvwbw/apparently_someone_is_trolling_russian/ ) . 
  i do n't know if that is accurate , though . 
  i sympathise with where you are coming from , but i do n't think this stunt is aimed at heterosexual russians . 
  i think it is aimed at homosexual russians , to tell them that they are not alone and are part of a proud community . 
  remember , they did wild stunts like this in san francisco and stockholm and in other places throughout the west before homosexuality was as accepted as it is now . 
  they did not plan on converting politicians or the regular trucker in some coffee shop . 
  their intended audience was other homosexuals . 
  it is possible the person who took this picture was just being arrogant about his cleverness , but i think the picture was taken to spread via social media and remind homosexuals they have nothing to hide or be ashamed of . 
  you would think so . 
  i know support for joining nato has gone up , but still the majority of the people do n't want to join . 
  i suppose the general feeling is that finland would be able to placate russia and would n't be invaded . 
  you know the cliche : `` it could never happen to us . '', 
  but to be fair , people remember the past and know that it did n't happen to us during the cold war when it did happen to other countries . 
  finland was able to stay out of the great conflicts and people think that we are still able to do so . 
  i saw this picture on social media this morning . 
  in a related story , the finnish state broadcaster yle mailed some of these stamps to russia to see what would happen , but apparently the russian censors were [ `` not interested '' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/russian_censors_not_interested_in_tom_of_finland_stamps/7475961 ) . 
  nato is not popular at all in finland . 
  i think it would take a clear and unmistakable threat , something big , to make joining realistic . 
  finns tend to follow nokia and other tech quite closely , so we know that nokia was having problems long before elop . 
  the company had become an arrogant , bloated product company and was unable to satisfy consumers . 
  elop just delivered the coup de grace . 
  he remains quite unpopular here , but he does n't carry the entire blame . 
  a finnish publisher has actually published a book about nokia [ in english ] ( http://www.amazon.com/decline-fall-nokia-david-cord/dp/9515233208/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1413777280&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=decline+and+fall+of+nokia ) if you are interested in the story from a finnish perspective . 
  a new book also just came out , but it is in the finnish language . 
  the idea that elop was a trojan horse remains popular among the conspiracy-minded , but both this book and the english one say that elop was n't a trojan horse . 
  luckily the bureaucrats have since calmed down and clarified their position , so all our culturally significant drinking songs can remain on the net .
