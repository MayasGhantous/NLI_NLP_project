  the tab for the ireland bailout was put on the finnish national debt ( among others ) , for instance . 
  we 're all in the common currency together , and these constant attempts to make it a zero-sum game where one country wins and another loses is not accurate and not helping matters . 
   greek debt reduction is the only way to avoid breakdown of what was to be an ` irreversible ' process . 
  i think so , too . 
  but the payment is due at the end of this month . 
  if the government falls there wo n't be time for elections , will there ? 
  i would assume anyone would need to be a legal resident to be eligible . 
  anyone in europe can move to finland freely , but someone from outside would find it difficult to get a residence permit . 
  they would have to have a job offer , family already in finland , or else enough money saved up to act as an entrepreneur to get a permit , i think . 
  i have seen no details . 
  even the association to promote the basic income in finland seem to be clueless : http://perustulo.org/ . 
  i think this is just something the government wants to study . 
  i 'm sure there are still some effects of the death of the mobile device industry . 
  ( by the way , the company nokia is doing very well . 
  they just bought alcatel-lucent . 
  but they do n't employ near the people in finland as they used to . ), 
  the forestry and shipping industries have been hurt . 
  trade with russia has been hurt because of the fall of the russian currency , sanctions , and their own terrible economy . 
  we used to have a fantastic export market in capital equipment , like big machinery , but that has been hurt . 
  our wages grew a lot faster than in places like germany , so we are now uncompetitive in many of our traditional strongest industries . 
  tl ; dr we are hurting because of a variety of cyclical and systemic factors . 
  i was referring to the fact that finland has the worst-performing economy in europe during the first quarter . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6829212/2-13052015-bp-en.pdf/1444bdf1-65ba-457d-829b-dee843b0c861 but certainly , compared to the situation in greece we are much better off . 
  historically , the finnish green party has been most in favour of a basic income . 
  the greens have included it in their official positions for many years now . 
  other political parties have generally been silent or slightly open to the idea . 
  even one of our richest citizens bj\u00f6rn wahlroos , a self-proclaimed champion of capitalism and the free market , has said in the past he was in favour of a basic income . 
  one exception is the social democrats , who have opposed it for ideological reasons , believing that all social benefits should be work-based . 
  the more cynical might also suggest the sdp do n't want to hurt their power base in the unions . 
  in the governing coalition today , both the centre and right-leaning national coalition have expressed cautious interest in the basic income . 
  the other partner , the finns party , is fairly extreme-left on economic issues but i do n't know if they have ever said anything officially about the idea . 
  i have n't heard what this ` experiment ' might entail , but i doubt it will come to much . 
  finland has one of the worst economies in europe at the moment and there is n't much money to go around . 
  i suppose they might find a hundred thousand euros or so . 
  i do n't know if they will actually find a few dozen people to try the basic income out on , or else just waste the money on some study by consultants . 
  ** edit ** : just noticed i said ` free press ' instead of ` free market ' . 
  and both greece and turkey are nato members . 
  there were [ quite a few ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homo#list_of_species ) different species in our genus . 
  i suspect there was quite a bit of interbreeding at different times . 
  this is a finnish photographer who was nicknamed the ` squirrel whisperer ' from how he gets squirrels to feed from his hand . 
  most of his stuff appears to be from the nordic region ( he seems to be in iceland at the moment ) but he does work around europe . 
  could someone explain this liberland to me ? 
  last minute deal . 
  new crisis develops down the line . 
  repeat . 
   our correspondent [ andrew walker ] says ** a member of the ecb 's governing board was quoted as saying he could not be sure that greek banks would open on monday ** , but that this comment had been `` selectively leaked by delegations from other countries '' . 
  ( emphasis mine )  `` the rest of the eurozone has been trying to put pressure on the greek government to strike a deal for months - and leaks like this suggest that the gloves have come off , '' he added . 
  this is freaking crazy . 
  they ca n't be sure the banks will open on monday ? 
  and who the hell would play with fire and potentially start a bank run simply to put pressure on greece ? 
  this is from november 2014 so is n't up to date : [ full list of incidents involving russian military and nato since march 2014 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/full-list-of-incidents-involving-russian-military-and-nato-since-march-2014-9851309.html ) finland is n't part of nato but the military also released a list : [ finnish defence force lists ten years of airspace violations ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_defence_force_lists_ten_years_of_airspace_violations/7442575 ) edit : and you can see it was n't just russians violating finnish airspace . 
  americans , french , norwegians , swedes ... practically everyone except australians . 
  your question is really vague . 
  if you are more specific you might get better answers . 
  i just do n't see russia riding to greece 's rescue . 
  what would they get out of it besides bragging rights of helping out a eurozone country when we refuse to ? 
  will greece leave the eu and join the eurasian economic union ? 
  i ca n't imagine it . 
  also , russia has their own financial problems . 
   russia 's finance ministry , which was effectively banned from borrowing on the global capital markets because of anti-moscow sanctions , expects the 2015 budget deficit to be 3.8 % of gdp and is tapping its reserve fund for the first time since 2009 to plug holes in the budget . 
  [ wsj : russia 's budget deficit more than doubles in a month ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-budget-deficit-more-than-doubles-in-a-month-1426176589 ), 
  it 's just the title of the wikipedia page . 
  for the confused : [ ` polish death camp ' controversy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy ), 
   failure to reach an agreement would , on the contrary , mark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a greek default and ultimately to the country 's exit from the euro area and -- most likely -- from the european union . 
  a manageable debt crisis , as the one that we are currently addressing with the help of our partners , would snowball into an uncontrollable crisis , with great risks for the banking system and financial stability . 
  an exit from the euro would only compound the already adverse environment , as the ensuing acute exchange rate crisis would send inflation soaring . 
   all this would imply deep recession , a dramatic decline in income levels , an exponential rise in unemployment and a collapse of all that the greek economy has achieved over the years of its eu , and especially its euro area , membership . 
  holy crap . 
  political and monetary leaders almost never , ever talk like this . 
  they are always shrouded in bland pr-speak . 
  this is something you see from excited journalists and editors , not from a central bank . 
  i 've never seen any press release like this before . 
   i still ca n't understand why those meetings are n't public and have to be held behind closed doors . 
  i understand your point , but it would be pretty difficult to negotiate in public . 
  imagine you are trying to buy a second-hand couch from your neighbour . 
  you and your neighbour are negotiating , but all of your roommates and all of his roommates are listening and screaming their opinions . 
  any offer you make will be too high or too low , according to this peanut gallery . 
  any offer your neighbour accepts or rejects will be greeted similarly . 
  it would be very time-consuming , stressful and inefficient for all sides . 
  now imagine you and your neighbour are negotiating in private and come to a potential deal . 
  now you can just go to your roommates and say ` we can buy this sofa for $ 50 . 
  i think it 's a bargain . ', 
  this is a much easier method . 
  supposedly this is the document containing the eu / imf offer which was obtained by the greek daily tovima : http://www.tovima.gr/files/1/2015/06/04/000.pdf you can see the greek counter offer here , which was leaked by the german paper tages spiegel : http://www.tagesspiegel.de/downloads/11870514/2/regierungsvorschlag%20griechenland from the financial times we also have a supposedly second greek offer : http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/files/2015/06/ending-the-greek-crisis-short.pdf just a word of warning : as far as i know none of the authorities have acknowledged these to be accurate negotiating positions . 
  they might just be memos or talking points or perhaps they have been entirely fabricated . 
  but they are pretty interesting to read . 
  finland 's president sauli niinist\u00f6 is in russia meeting president vladimir putin . 
  as expected , finland 's possible nato membership came up and putin gave a warning , saying :  if someone threatens our territory we must place our forces in the area from which it comes . 
  it is nato that is approaching us and not vice versa . 
  finland 's best security guarantee is to remain neutral . 
  but there seemed to also be an incentive offered . 
  the russian state-owned company rosatom made a surprise announcement saying they were interested in building another nuclear reactor at finland 's lovissa power plant . 
  to me , this seems like classic carrot-and-stick diplomacy : offering big foreign direct investment if finland stays neutral and a not-so-veiled threat if we do n't . 
  so they are forecasting a greek budget surplus next year . 
  i suppose that is n't impossible , but it will be brutally difficult . 
  the problem in greece is back in the news again but i was n't seeing very many hard numbers . 
  so i went to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database ) to see how government revenue and expenditures had changed over the past couple of years . 
  it seems to be a vicious circle . 
  they cut their expenses , which hurts their economy , which causes revenue to fall , which means they need to cut more expenses . 
  can someone explain to me why turkey 's intelligence agency would help the islamic state ?
