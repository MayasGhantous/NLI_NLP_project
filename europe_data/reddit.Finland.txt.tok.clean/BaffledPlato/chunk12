  they would n't want all the money currently sitting in greece to suddenly flee to europe because people are afraid of this new , lower-value drachma . 
  it is n't simple , but i think greece should be talking to the best economic minds they can find to look at these pros and cons . 
   the current government was voted on the basis that we will remain on the euro no matter what . 
  i know . 
  that 's the problem . 
  they will remain in the eurozone no matter what happens ? 
  what about permanent 25 % unemployment ? 
  brain drain ? 
  pensioners who ca n't afford electricity ? 
  unfunded health care and schools ? 
  there are pros and cons to remaining in the common currency . 
  do n't discount the cons . 
  i wonder how much of this is ` support blatter ' and how much is ` oppose anything america does . ', 
  well , that 's understandable . 
  i think greece , and maybe others as well , need to sit down and seriously look at the pros and cons of the common currency in regards to their own situation . 
  there is a great deal of unknowns with going back to the drachma , but if they stick with the euro it is pretty clear they are going to continue to suffer for years if not decades . 
  yeah , that 's the big question . 
  i wonder if they will delay the vote ? 
   northern and eastern europe countries , except sweden , do n't care at all about this problem . 
  i kind of agree with you , at least in regards to finland . 
  sweden really puts us to shame . 
  it 's a bit embarrassing , to be honest . 
  well , they are n't kidnapping them . 
  they worked with the swiss , and the swiss were the ones doing the arresting based upon warrants they accepted and believe are valid . 
  we know they wo n't accept american warrants they do n't believe are valid - look at roman polanski . 
  i liked the source for number 9 . 
   9 ) i 'm latvian, 
  i thought that 's what they meant by including it in the legislation : that it would be either on the driver 's license or in the database . 
  maybe i misinterpreted it , and it will just be in the legislation text ? 
  sorry , i 'm not fluent . 
  does n't ` k\u00f6rkortslagstiftningen ' mean the driver license legislation ? 
  yeah , it is . 
  i got confused trying to write a sentence which included words in three languages . 
  i suppose it is just for identification purposes , like height and weight or whatever . 
  i just checked my finnish driver 's license and it does n't include any of that , and based upon google images \u00c5land 's license looks the same . 
  maybe that information is put in the system but not on the physical card ? 
  the autonomous \u00c5land islands have decided to allow the gender neutral ` hen ' to be picked on future drivers ' licenses . 
  ( ` han ' is for males and ` hon ' is for females in swedish . 
  ` hen ' is gender neutral , similar to the finnish language ` han ' which is used for men or women . ), 
  the article says it was a close vote , with 11 for the change , 10 against , and 7 abstentions in the parliament vote . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.eva.fi/blog/2015/02/03/evan-arvo-ja-asennetutkimuksen-ennakkotieto-nato-kannat-muuttuneet-myonteisemmiksi/ ) is the last poll that i know about , which is from earlier this year . 
  it had 26 % yes and 43 % no . 
  but these polls have shown some really wild swings , depending upon how the question is asked and what is happening to our east . 
  that 's interesting . 
  this chondoist chongu party was based on a religion and actually has a pretty fascinating past : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chondoist_chongu_party, 
  i think the bank actually explained it quite nicely :  ... it should not come as a surprise that there are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum . 
  it is one of the bank 's responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives . 
   it is not sensible to talk about this work publicly , in advance . 
  but as with work done prior to the scottish referendum , we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time . 
  i think it would be a bigger scandal if they were n't doing this . 
  [ james thompson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_thompson_%28author%29 ) was a finnish-american writer who specialised in stories about corruption and morally ambiguous cops in finland . 
  he addressed some contemporary issues like racism and a nationalistic political party , and many characters in his books were thinly-veiled caricatures of finnish politicians . 
  it 's a shame he died last year , because this story was right up his alley . 
  yeah , i would say it is decent . 
  i started liking it more when i saw [ an orchestra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogpctqzaz7m ) do a terrible job on the song . 
  it 's punk . 
  it does n't work on violins . 
  among finnish political parties , we have the [ communist party ] ( http://www.skp.fi/english ) . 
  the [ left alliance ] ( http://www.vasemmisto.fi/ ) was founded by a merger between some old communist parties . 
  i think there are still some extreme left elements in it , but it is probably a bit more towards the centre than its predecessors . 
  we also have anarchist groups that seem to be rather fluid , with various organisations forming , dissolving and reforming . 
  the majority of anarchists seem to be students and younger people . 
  they are under tight watch after the [ smash asem ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/smash_asem ) riots a number of years ago . 
  they are [ still active ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/watch_police_arrest_anarchists_ahead_of_may_day_march/7216838 ) but the police swoop in pretty quickly whenever they try to do anything . 
  um , i do n't think he was sent to the psychiatric hospital because he spoke out against islam . 
  and i have to say your source certainly has an [ interesting agenda ] ( http://www.europeanguardian.com/about ) . 
  i would probably vote for the finnish war . 
  that 's strange . 
  i 've never seen a mod in / r/europe do that before . 
  and the post was just about a postage stamp , not some controversial political issue . 
  how odd . 
  no , i do n't think russia considers us neutral . 
  they know we are clearly with the west . 
  but imagine how the big bully on the playground does n't care if the little kids hate him or not , just as long as they obey him or at least do n't get in his way . 
  it is basically the same thing . 
  but from finland 's point of view there are a lot of potential downsides to nato membership . 
  our businesses have invested a lot in russia , and these could be seized , hypothetically . 
  russians are the most important tourists . 
  russia is one of the most important trading partners . 
  russia could devastate our economy if they wanted . 
  there is also an old fear of being dragged into something that does n't have anything to do with us . 
  in the worst case scenario finland could become a battleground between the great powers . 
  back during the invasion of iraq many finns were worried about the possibility of us being obligated to fight in similar wars . 
  let 's say a terrorist attack on america is blamed on some middle-eastern country , the nato collective defense clause is activated , and the next thing we know finnish soldiers are bumbling around in a desert getting shot at . 
  the idea seems silly , but a lot of people were worried about that . 
  during the cold war finland tried to remain neutral . 
  it neither joined nato nor the warsaw pact . 
  it refused to recognise east or west germany for a while . 
  this worked pretty well . 
  we remained independent even though we were in the soviet union 's sphere of influence . 
  they did interfere at times , but we were never occupied and controlled . 
  independence was the goal , and we achieved that . 
  when the soviet union fell the baltics hurried to join nato , but finland thought that if neutrality worked why change it ? 
  historically we have tried very hard to be allied with sweden whenever possible , but sweden was understandably reluctant . 
  if sweden joins nato i guarantee we will join . 
  but until then it looks like we will stay with the status quo . 
  holy crap . 
  that is a great subreddit . 
  i did n't know that existed , which is a shame , because there is some great stuff there . 
  ** finland ** the main worries are how the new centre-right governing coalition will tackle the terrible economic situation , our related budget woes , and , of course , russia .
