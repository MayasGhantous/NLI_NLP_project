  [ output of the national economy in march on level with the previous month ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/ktkk/2015/03/ktkk_2015_03_2015-05-13_tie_001_en.html ) [ finland may ask for extra time for budget fix plans ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finland_may_ask_for_extra_time_for_budget_fix_plans/7994003 ) [ nato to ramp up defence cooperation with finland , sweden ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/nato_to_ramp_up_defence_cooperation_with_finland_sweden/7996486 ) but in a bit of better news , nokia is aggressively expanding ( and no , i 'm not talking about mobile phones ) . 
  they also just celebrated their 150th anniversary . 
  since that time nokia has been in a variety of industries : forestry , power generation , televisions , rubber boots , and of course mobile phones . 
  now they are doing well in networks . 
  [ understanding nokia 's plan to buy alcatel-lucent ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/04/15/understanding-nokias-plan-to-buy-alcatel-lucent-the-numbers/ ), 
  do you have a list of the artists and titles ? 
  actually , yeah , that would probably be better than lordi . 
  hmm . 
  maybe [ lordi 's hard rock hallelujah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gah9nrgnhuu ) . 
  it is moving to the far east . 
  according to the finnish maritime industry cluster sales in 2015 will be $ 460 million , compared to $ 700 million in 2008 . 
  according to ptt industrial timber production in 2015 will still be 13 % below 2007 levels . 
  to make matters worse , average prices will be 21 % lower than in 2007 . 
  so we have lower turnover at lower prices . 
  nokia and its contractors devastated russian trade shrunk machinery exports collapsed shipbuilding dying forestry stagnation wages too high relative to competitors makes exports too expensive no stimulus measures tax increases ( vat in particular ) lowers domestic disposable income, 
  the graph says `` europa '' so they must mean the continent , not the union . 
  i do n't know . 
  it looks kind of silly to me . 
  did n't russia just ban images like this ? 
  if it was flattering i do n't think they would forbid them . 
  source : http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2015-04-28/753291/just-nu-putin-rider-pa-ubat-i-helsingfors it says one of their employees made the picture . 
  it does n't say who , unfortunately , because they deserve credit for a cool picture . 
  yeah , the chairman of nokia risto siilasmaa got a lot of press when he suggested it . 
  i ca n't see it happening , though . 
  we still have good education and saunas . 
  but the economic situation is putting a strain on everything . 
  i thought [ this bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35656150?ocid=socialflow_twitter ) was pretty good at explaining it . 
  yes . 
  the agreement has particular provisions to allow [ border controls to be reinstated ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13194723 ) . 
  via the bbc :  under the schengen rules , signatories may reinstate internal border controls for 10 days , if this has to be done immediately for `` public policy or national security '' reasons . 
   if the problem continues , the controls can be maintained for `` renewable periods '' of up to 20 days and for a maximum of two months . 
   an eu regulation in 2013 specified that such controls `` should remain an exception and should only be effected as a measure of last resort , for a strictly limited scope and period of time '' . 
   the period for temporary border controls is longer in cases where the threat is considered `` foreseeable '' . 
  the controls can be maintained for renewable periods of up to 30 days , and for a maximum of six months . 
   but an extension of two years maximum is allowed under article 26 of the schengen borders code , in `` exceptional circumstances '' . 
   speaking at an annual vespers service in st. paul 's basilica in rome attended by representatives of other religions , he asked `` forgiveness for the un-gospel like behaviour by catholics towards christians of other churches '' . 
  i like this pope . 
  that actually sounds pretty fun . 
  i like games like that . 
  too bad i 'm going to be out tonight . 
  i feel stupid for asking this , but what is eu4 ? 
  i know reddit likes extremely short content , but if you are interested in mediterranean smuggling i definitely recommend taking ten minutes to read this article . 
  we constantly hear about migrants but we almost never hear about the organisations that make it all happen . 
  finland 's [ national museum ] ( http://www.kansallismuseo.fi/en/nationalmuseum ) . 
  ca n't afford the entry fee ? 
  then come friday afternoons when you can enter for free !, 
  generally , i tend to agree with you , but just as a point of contention both sweden and finland have managed to maintain an independent , deterrent military force as well as a generous welfare state . 
  pulling away from america and developing an independent military does not necessarily mean europe would be unable to maintain current social programs . 
  generally speaking i think the media takes into consideration what organisations want to be called , but this is not a hard and fast rule . 
  just like yahoo !, 
  is often called simply yahoo in the press , or the democratic people 's republic of korea is called north korea . 
  if an organisation wants to call them nato they are allowed to . 
  was n't there some sort of ( unofficial ? ), 
  agreement with russia that nato expansion would not include permanent bases in former soviet states ? 
  i seem to remember something about nato getting around that by continuous rotating of troops , and estonia asking for a permanent base . 
   also , bbc , it should be `` nato '' , not `` nato '' . 
  over time acronyms often become regular proper nouns . 
  the influential guardian style guide recommends ` nato ' . 
  yeah , that is very similar . 
  i did n't know they had those in italy . 
  [ here is the finnish version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dish_draining_closet ) . 
  in finland we dry our dishes in a special rack built into the cupboard over the sink instead of hand drying them or putting them in some stand-alone rack sitting on your counter . 
  when i think of ` concentration camps ' i think of a place to concentrate undesirable people , or to gather them all together . 
  if i 'm thinking of a place to kill people i think of ` death camps . ', 
  i 'm not sure what is the generally accepted terminology . 
  in the finnish civil war we massacred quite a few of each other in the [ red and white terrors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war#red_and_white_terror ) , and about twice as many died from disease or starvation in camps . 
  then during the continuation war / wwii we had a lot of deaths in our [ concentration camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_karelian_concentration_camps ) . 
  we also assisted in some rather [ brutal activities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einsatzkommando_finnland ) with the germans . 
  some of this was probably related to ethnic cleansing and eliminating ideological undesirables , but this is still rather controversial and unclear . 
  some finns are still pretty defensive about it . 
  the emojis are part of the finnish foreign ministry 's online [ advent calendar ] ( http://xmas.finland.fi/01-kaamos/ ) . 
  i believe they are officially releasing one a day , like a christmas calendar , but you can download them all from their website now . 
  here 's an article about it from the [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/finland-launches-national-emojis-of-typical-characters-like-the-headbanger ) . 
  hell , at slush this year the ` big news ' from jolla was some plan to help small companies expand to asia . 
  i was baffled . 
  you would think they would focus on their own products and services . 
   it will come to arrests of political figures and possibly the suspension of democracy in catalonia . 
  that 's pretty serious . 
  are you saying the spanish government will arrest prominent catalan politicians ? 
   if i get drunk in finland and ca n't speak finnish , how well would i be able to communicate with the local drunk people ? 
  there is an interesting fact that when finns get drunk they miraculously become perfectly fluent in english ( or at least think they are ) . 
  so no worries . 
  it 's almost the end of october : how is lego not meeting orders for two months away ? 
  back when i worked in retail ( admittedly a long time ago ) we made major christmas orders in late spring !, 
  do they delay ordering for the christmas shopping season nowadays ? 
  we have sweet taxes in finland , too . 
  it does n't seem to have [ changed consumer behaviour ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/sweet_tax_fails_to_slow_candy_consumption/6992250 ) and now there are [ plans to drop it ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-34389928 ) . 
  talking about nokia research , here 's a bit of trivia : with the purchase of alcatel lucent nokia will own [ bell labs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bell_labs ) , one of the most famous tech research institutions in the world . 
   the historic laboratory originated in the late 19th century as the volta laboratory and bureau created by alexander graham bell ...  researchers working at bell labs are credited with the development of radio astronomy , the transistor , the laser , the charge-coupled device ( ccd ) , information theory , the unix operating system , the c programming language , s programming language and the c++ programming language . 
  eight nobel prizes have been awarded for work completed at bell laboratories . 
  munamies , or egg man in english . 
  i 'm not sure there is much information about it in english , but [ here is wikipedia translated ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2ffi.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fmunamies&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  no , microsoft just bought the mobile phone division . 
  nokia as a company is still independent . 
  it is alive and well in the telecom infrastructure business . 
   the cable was built by the french telecom equipment company alcatel lucent you would think yle would mention that it will soon be the finnish telecom equipment company , because alcatel lucent is being bought by nokia . 
   europe 's third-largest budget airline is considering flights to edinburgh and bergen , norway from u.s. airports that have little to no international service today , such as new york 's westchester county airport and connecticut 's bradley international airport , just north of hartford , kjos said . 
   average prices on such routes are likely to be closer to $ 300 round trip , kjos said ... 
  so going from europe to the us will be more expensive , but still not bad . 
  they plan on using smaller airports which charge airlines less for landing slots .
