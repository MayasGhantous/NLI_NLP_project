  of course , all the news outlets have huge headlines : `` finland is least corrupt nation '' . 
  but the way the report is done is that they measure the ** perception ** of corruption . 
  i understand that it is difficult , if not impossible , to accurately measure corruption , but the way this perception index is portrayed is more than a bit misleading . 
  i think there are similar amounts of corruption in finland as in any other western european country . 
  what 's wrong with a paper calendar ? 
  i like them . 
  yeah , but there are large swaths of the american population that have chronic financial problems . 
  is n't turkey generally seen as a secular society ? 
  i think even its constitution states that it is secular democracy . 
  generally speaking , the wealthier a society is the less religious it is : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/religion_economy.png [ source : wealth and religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wealth_and_religion ) it is a pretty fascinating correlation when you think about it . 
  i do n't think there will be any fines . 
  apple is using some of nokia 's patents but they have n't agreed upon a royalty rate . 
  so taking it to the courts is basically a hardball negotiating tactic . 
  i bet there is a 98 % chance it will be settled before getting in front of a judge . 
  is this one of those things which require unanimous approval from all member states ? 
  if so , then poland could simply veto it . 
  who said anything about predicting the future ? 
  it is relevant to the previous poster 's statement , which also had nothing to do with predicting the future . 
   war , it will be seen , is now a purely internal affair ... 
  the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects , and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory , but to keep the structure of society intact . 
   george orwell , nineteen eighty-four, 
  i posted an article here from yle regarding all the criticism the project has generated from experts . 
  the post quickly generated so many downvotes that it was removed . 
  i guess people want to be hopeful - which is a good thing - but i think some people do n't want to hear about reasons for caution . 
  they use real candles in the cathedral , but when she has to move around a lot they switch to battery operated ones . 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  just be polite and respectful . 
  you do n't need a huge list of dos and do n'ts . 
  the image comes from newspaper [ hufvudstadsbladet ] ( https://www.hbl.fi/artikel/lucia-lyste-upp-mork-och-kall-huvudstad/ ) . 
  the finnish broadcaster has some more photos [ here ] ( https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2016/12/13/lucia-kommer-med-ljus-och-hopp ) . 
  and if you 're curious about st. lucy 's day here is a [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_lucy's_day ) . 
  probably . 
  here are the subreddit 's rules :  a. 
  local crime : local crime news with no international or political significance will be removed . 
  criminal offenses are common and by themselves are not relevant at a pan-european scale . 
  however , we reserve the right to approve funny , interesting and/or unique crime stories . 
  meta-studies , or longitudinal studies , of crime and the nature of crime are perfectly acceptable . 
  the nature of the crime is unclear at this point , so i could n't hazard a guess if it has an international or political significance . 
  i thought it was interesting that the map says estonia was advanced technologically at that time , too . 
  it 's kind of odd how misinformation about finland 's education system gets spread around the rest of the world . 
  probably the most popular is the ` finland has no homework ' myth . 
  it is like people in another country know we have good education so try and make up some simple and counter intuitive reason for it . 
  no , swedish occupation is just considered better than the other occupations . 
  that kind of sounds familiar . 
  i like how they tossed in a couple lonely olympic flags like an afterthought . 
   this article is n't an exception , just a few days ago there was one where a `` historian '' told on a channel that has about 20 million viewers how finland 's independence was illegal and how it `` would be better if finland belonged to russia again '' . 
  oh god , it was n't b\u00e4ckman , was it ? 
  that guy pops out to spew pro-russian stuff every time there is some controversy . 
  top gear came to finland one time to find out and talked to [ mika h\u00e4kkinen about it ] ( https://youtu.be/2bmqdnx5r1u ) . 
  cool episode . 
  he has dual citizenship . 
  his father keke is a finn who won the f1 championship in 1982 . 
  nico competed as a finn in his early years , as you can see [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/v6v0n ) . 
  he switched to the german flag later in his career because he claimed coming from a bigger country got him more attention . 
  see , that 's why we love you so much . 
  that looks cool . 
  it kind of reminds me of lake saimaa in finland . 
  you might consider cross posting this in / r/mapporn . 
  if someone watched that they might get the impression that finns are socially awkward drunks , which of course could not be farther from the truth . 
  except during midsummer . 
  and most other holidays . 
  and weekends . 
  okay , maybe it is accurate . 
  the uk unemployment rate has been steadily dropping for several years and now is 4.8 % , almost half of the broad eu rate . 
  it only makes sense that employers have to pay more to recruit people during a skills shortage . 
  people change their minds all the time . 
  if they had another referendum complete with campaigning by both sides ` leave ' might win again . 
  well , the uk voted to leave and have invoked article 50 . 
  i know brexit has n't been completed yet , but perhaps this children 's book is expected to be used for some time and they want to accurately portray the future situation . 
  what does she think of it ? 
  i was on the fence between getting the new galaxy or waiting for the new nokias . 
  we have some odd sports . 
  wife carrying , mobile phone throwing ( do we still do that ? 
  not sure ) , sauna endurance , swamp soccer , air guitar , beer floating ( where you sit on a rubber raft and drink beer . 
  not really a sport , i guess , but neither are any of them ) ... 
  in recent years nokia has n't focused too much on the consumer market . 
  they bought alcatel-lucent and are a major player in telecom infrastructure . 
  they are now getting back into mobile devices using foxconn as a partner and android as an os , but they are also looking at some other stuff like health tech , professional photography and vr . 
  i played with their vr experience at the slush conference in helsinki last autumn and it was the best i 've ever seen , although to be fair i 'm not an expert . 
  the linked article is pretty good if you are curious what they are up to . 
   with such an array of indispensable structures carrying so many waters , compare , if you will , the idle pyramids or the useless , though famous , works of the greeks !, 
   sextus julius frontinus , water commissioner at rome , 97 ad even the romans knew how fucking impressive these things were . 
  finland went bonkers about this . 
  sure , it was great to win when we had always done so bad , but this was ( almost ) as over-the-top as winning the ice hockey world championship . 
  the song was all over the radio . 
  parents videotaped their kids singing it . 
  a tabloid published photos of lordi without his makeup which caused national outrage . 
  i knew we had hit peak stupidity when i walked into a grocery store and saw [ lordi cola ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/lordi/images/a/ad/lordi_cola.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090518052322 ) . 
  if this is on / r/europe i wonder what kind of ads they get on / r/european . 
  this was actually quite an interesting article . 
  i know reddit likes to just read headlines ( i do it too - sorry ) , but i recommend you spend a couple of minutes reading this . 
   hayracks are permanent structures , primarily made of wood , upon which fodder for animals is dried , although their use is not limited to drying hay . 
  i like how they are used for all sorts of things , from hanging flowers to protecting cars . 
  they are really cool looking buildings . 
  just out of curiosity , how is this anti-le pen ? 
  is ' #resist ' used by anti-le pen protesters ? 
  [ winter war - 105 days ] ( https://twitter.com/winterwar1939 ), 
  i 've been trying to find some event or change in policy in turkey to explain this ( apparently ) sudden influx of migrants . 
  according to some news reports i 've seen it has taken the migrants several months to get into the heart of europe . 
  what happened several months ago ?
