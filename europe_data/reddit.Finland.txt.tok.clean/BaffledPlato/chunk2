  what is the story about renzi defying the eu budget deficit rules ? 
  what are people saying about that ? 
  ** finland ** * our prime minister was ridiculed around the world for saying [ the iphone killed nokia . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/stubb_in_cnbc_interview_the_iphone_killed_nokia_and_the_ipad_killed_the_finnish_paper_industry/7526429 ) * people were rather shocked to learn that the office of the president of russia [ owns land in the picturesque \u00c5land islands ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/thursdays_papers_cheap_beer_putin_asked_to_return_land_and_a_big_jump_in_welfare_payments/7531594 ) . 
  * we thought bureaucracy ran amok when rumours came that the government [ would forbid private bloggers to use the word ` whisky ' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/hs_finnish_officials_ban_the_word_whisky_on_private_blog/7523995 ) . 
  * and we are still worrying about losing our [ coveted aaa credit rating ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/credit_downgrade_could_cost_finland_100_million_in_debt_interest/7523375 ) . 
  well , they do have a point . 
  defense spending has been inching downwards the past several years . 
  i know the budget is tight , but i think defense spending needs to go up . 
  just for a comparison , nato members have a goal of spending 2 % of gdp on defense . 
  russia spends 4.2 % . 
  we are only spending 1.35 % this year and it is going down next year . 
  well , staying out of nato has worked for the past 60 years . 
  but from what i understand most of the defense establishment is in favour of joining , which should probably tell us something . 
  so do i. i did n't think my user name through . 
  baffledtomato would be pretty cool , too . 
  he 's a frequent traveler with significant attachment issues . 
   after the preliminary report , decision-makers will also have to decide whether finnish air defence will be carried out solo , by joining forces with neighbour sweden , or entering into the nato alliance . 
  it looks like this upgrade is tied into the bigger defence picture . 
  joining nato still seems politically impossible at the moment , but it seems we keep inching closer to joining . 
  sex and drugs are pulling their weight , but rock and roll needs to get its act together . 
  for those interested in more finnish art , you can always look at the finnish national gallery website . 
  some of my favourites are the [ landscapes ] ( http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?lang=en&amp;si=&amp;qtype=generic&amp;query=landscape ) . 
  we really do have a beautiful country . 
  for those thinking tl ; dr here are a couple of quotes i found interesting . 
   finlandization meant diminishment of independence , erosion of democracy , and strangling of freedom of speech . 
  it is a model a finn could not possibly recommend to anyone , although in recent times many foreign experts have thought it appropriate for ukraine . 
   women in finnish literature were subjects , from the start . 
  these pioneers began a conversation about women 's rights , women 's identity , the right to one 's own body , that continues today , and they were an influence in making finland a country with a level of equality that is good compared to other countries , a nation in which about half of all writers are women . 
   other finno-ugric languages have fared poorly over a broad geographic area , most especially in russia , and many of these languages , not to mention their literatures , have already died or are threatened thanks to colonization , which has been the fate of so many other indigenous peoples . 
   with vladimir putin 's reign there emerged a new threat : the growth of centralized power and the harmonization of federation laws . 
  the goal was to change local laws that had granted finno-ugric jurisdictions the right to their local resources and natural riches ; to return the flow of money back to moscow . 
   in 2005 russia 's government-controlled media accused these little groups of conspiracy and claimed that the work of cultural cooperation among finno-ugric peoples was bent on creating a finno-ugric super state -- a claim that would have been laughable if it were not an attempt by a colonial power like russia to further oppress already downtrodden groups of people . 
  that is news to me that they did n't want to unify . 
  do you have any sources for further reading ? 
  i really liked that novel . 
  i have yet to read her newer one , but it sounds to have similar themes . 
  from her publisher : `` when the doves disappeared is a story of occupation , resistance , and collaboration in estonia during and after world war ii . '', 
  it is kind of eerie how all this history she writes about is very apt today . 
  maybe it is still 7 october where op is . 
  the english version starts on page 11 , by the way . 
  i thought any asylum seeker had to apply in the first eu country he reached ? 
  but if they are n't seeking asylum and have valid passports or visas , why in the world did they choose such a method of reaching europe ? 
  the cypriot interior minister said they were n't illegal immigrants , which seems to imply they all had valid travel documents . 
  ireland is going to be pissed . 
  yeah , what 's up with malta ? 
  i know they do n't exactly have a lot of open land to use , but i wonder about offshore . 
  perhaps sweden should have the russian flag too , because at that point in time finland was part of sweden . 
  that is exactly the argument many pro-solar commentators are making here in finland . 
  the politicians want to push biofuels , particularly wood pellets , because of the domestic forestry industry . 
  they claim solar is n't viable here , but people point out how well germany has done . 
   seasonally adjusted it might be , actually . 
  my bad . 
  i prefer to compare the same period year-to-year instead of incrementally . 
  there are very wide seasonal variations , so comparing the spring and summer of one year can give a false picture because of summer jobs or students working during their break . 
   compared with a year ago , the unemployment rate fell in twenty-two member states , increased in three and remained stable in three . 
  the largest decreases were registered in hungary ( 10.4 % to 8.1 % between june 2013 and june 2014 ) , portugal ( 16.3 % to 14.0 % ) , croatia ( 18.1 % to 16.2 % ) , spain ( 26.2 % to 24.5 % ) and ireland ( 13.1 % to 11.5 % ) . 
  the only increases were registered in finland ( 8.1 % to 8.7 % ) , italy ( 12.1 % to 12.6 % ) and luxembourg ( 5.9 % to 6.3 % ) . 
  a lot of that is because of economics . 
  news outlets ca n't afford to pay a reporter to spend two weeks on an investigative journalism article which will be immediately re-reported by everyone else when it is published . 
  long play is trying to bring long form investigative journalism articles back . 
  i doubt they can make it work financially , though . 
  people will not pay for news content they can get for free elsewhere . 
  they avoid the big guys . 
  putin , obama , merkel ... heads of government are n't being sanctioned . 
  both sides go for lower level officials . 
  to forbid a head of government to travel is just a bit too aggressive and a breach of diplomatic protocol . 
  well , actually , i think this article is accurate . 
  the government did approve the deal . 
  no , it has n't been approved by parliament yet , but the article does n't say it was . 
  the article says it was a `` agreement in principal , '' which is completely accurate . 
  also , i do n't believe putin is himself under the sanctions regime . 
  at least , i did n't see his name on the official eu [ sanctions ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32014d0238 ) [ lists ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:oj.l_.2014.221.01.0001.01.eng ) . 
  that said , i agree with you that finland 's recent actions with russia look a bit suspicious . 
  the [ finnish president ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/president_dismisses_finlandisation_claims/7482368 ) has been put on the defensive . 
  well , there really is n't too much of interest here , to be honest , at least when you think of the things tourists normally want . 
  i think it is funny that whenever a tourist goes to / r/finland to ask what they should do on their visit everyone always says go to estonia . 
  rabbit is a maltese specialty . 
  they also have good cheese and other dairy products . 
  the various italian cuisines . 
  i 'm rather fond of tuscan and lazio . 
  sure . 
  they tend to be quite helpful . 
  i do n't know . 
  that 's a good question . 
  perhaps many people in the orthodox church have finnish ancestry , but i 'm not certain . 
  you might ask this in / r/finland . 
  yes , there is some knowledge of that . 
  there are various associations that are designed to study those peoples , and some universities have courses in them . 
  there has been a lot of movement of people since the continuation war , and a lot of ethnic russians have moved into those areas . 
  a lot of finnic people were moved away by the soviets . 
  i think generally most finns still recognise that there are `` kindred people '' across the eastern border , but it is a hazy concept . 
  i ca n't think of any ingrian tradition off hand . 
  it might be mixed in a bit with karelian culture , which is still very big in finland . 
  it depends upon the era . 
  dictatorships are a funny thing - a good dictator is the best form of government and a bad dictator is the worst . 
  finland really became a nation because some czars were very good to us . 
  they encouraged the spread and development of the finnish language , gave us real autonomy and let find our own way . 
  russia was a benevolent , caring ruler . 
  when they started to take these things away from us is when things began to go sour .
