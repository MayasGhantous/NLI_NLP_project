  yes , i would say so . 
  when the soviet union collapsed we allowed ingrian finns to move here and claim finnish citizenship , for instance . 
  that 's right . 
  anyone who speaks a finno-ugric language is like a relation . 
  yeah , that would actually be more accurate but if i said sweden was our mother it would seem she had been in a relationship with our stepdad russia . 
  although i guess they were , only the relationship was a series of wars . 
  no , but it is possible that the uk without scotland would be more likely to leave the eu . 
  here are the [ opinions ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/09/12/calculator-does-scoxit-brexit/ ) of one reuters editor . 
  yeah : [ social desirability bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_desirability_bias ) . 
  finland considers estonia like a brother , sweden like an uncle , and russia like the evil stepdad we 're glad has finally gotten the fuck out of the house . 
  the final tally shows sd getting more votes than any previous poll that i have seen . 
  was this a sudden change of heart by many voters or polling inaccuracies ? 
  up here in the north it almost looks like the swedish empire has reconstituted itself . 
  but would nato members help us ? 
  this is a serious question . 
  why should they ? 
  i have difficulty imagining countries being willing to go to war with russia simply because they like us . 
  i might be wrong , certainly , but it just seems very unlikely . 
  history . 
  during the winter war we begged for help , and no one would help us . 
  we did receive individual volunteers , and some machinery , but no country was willing to go to war with russia to save us . 
  that 's understandable , of course , and i do n't blame them . 
  during the cold war we managed to stay independent . 
  it was due to finlandisation and all that , which no one here is proud of . 
  but we did it . 
  we stayed independent . 
  i think most finns trust our ability to placate russia more than we trust other countries ' willingness to go to war for us . 
  the reason is simply because that is exactly what happened in the past . 
  in all honesty , i have n't the slightest idea what you are talking about . 
  what has finland done to you ? 
  and we 're not in nato for a reason . 
  the majority of finns do n't want to be in nato for a reason . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_casualties_of_war ) there were 6,717 american deaths in iraq and afghanistan . 
  i think a confrontation with russia could be much , much worse . 
  look at vietnam , which cost 58,000 + american lives and dragged on for years . 
  the public justifiably asked if it was all worth it . 
  as a european literally sitting right next to russia , it is in my best interests to soberly consider exactly how far america would be willing to go . 
  sometimes . 
  just a hypothetical question : let 's say there is some small , localised incident in a tiny country like estonia . 
  now how many american deaths will the u.s. public stand to protect a little country like estonia ? 
  a hundred ? 
  a hundred thousand ? 
  if estonia is invaded , how far will mr. average joe go to protect some country he may not even know exists ? 
  america should uphold its commitments to nato members and not intervene with non-nato members . 
  if a country wants to join nato , america should take it seriously and realise what risks this entails . 
  if a country does n't want to join nato , america should respect that and leave it alone . 
  this is n't going to work . 
  it is impossible for putin to back down under a threat . 
  the only way russia will stop is if they can do it while saving face . 
  they certainly wo n't stop under threat . 
  now the interesting thing about this is that russian planes have violated finnish airspace fairly often in the past . 
  in the past , however , finland has been rather quiet about it . 
  we , being the public , would usually hear about it long after the fact when we made some sort of polite tut-tut through diplomatic channels . 
  this time , though , we are coming out in public with it right away , and even releasing photos . 
  this is very unusual , and is perhaps a sign that the finnish government is getting a bit more annoyed . 
  i just did a quick calculation based upon our energy imports and how much of those imports comes from russia . 
  based upon this , russia supplies 29.7 % of the eu-28 's crude oil , 10.9 % of our solid fuels and 21.1 % of our natural gas . 
  in other words , there is no way in hell we can survive without their energy . 
  edit : i seem to have screwed up the formatting somehow . 
  here are the sources : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/file:main_origin_of_primary_energy_imports,_eu-28,_2002%e2%80%9312_ ( % 25_of_extra_eu-28_imports ) _ yb14.png http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/file:energy_dependency_rate,_eu-28,_2002%e2%80%9312_ ( % 25_of_net_imports_in_gross_inland_consumption_and_bunkers , _ based_on_tonnes_of_oil_equivalent ) _ yb14.png, 
  it is a nice graphic of the north-south divide as it is now , though . 
  but it is all relative . 
  there is a huge difference between a $ 10 billion debt in estonia and germany , for example . 
  that 's a nice map , but i wish you could also see this information as a percent of gdp . 
  i see they have a mobile phone between finland and sweden . 
  someday someone should probably let them know about nokia and ericsson . 
  interesting . 
  the website for the russian presidency has a transcript of niinist\u00f6 's speech , so perhaps they were n't too upset about the cold war jibe . 
  that makes sense . 
  rocks are cracking under 30 degree temperatures ? 
  i 've never heard of such a thing before . 
  yeah , i 'm weird . 
  i love the stuff . 
  if you google images of `` red cross convoy '' you will find that white is indeed a common colour for these aid convoys . 
  for instance , [ this was the first image on google ] ( http://www.aquarticles.com/images/africa/part_2/s02%20red%20cross%20convoy_p.jpg ) . 
  if the red cross had agreed to participate , i assume they would have painted red crosses on the trucks . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2014/07/research-maps-cultural-history/ ) is an interesting article about this research from northeastern university in boston . 
  countries are allowed to re-implement border controls for specific reasons . 
  france did it a couple of years ago to try and stop [ migrants coming up from italy ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13109631 ) . 
  here in finland several years ago we had some big gathering of eu leaders and they did it for security reasons . 
  i was flying into helsinki from sweden ( ? 
  i think ) and had to go through customs . 
  so many , or perhaps most , countries still keep border control infrastructure in working order for cases like this . 
  yes . 
  i would kick a puppy for authentic russian blini . 
  it would have to be a bad puppy and good blini , though . 
  i thought of mentioning reindeer with lingonberry jam , but i think that is rather common in the nordic area and is n't necessarily finnish . 
  karelian pies are a good one . 
  i think that generally we are n't as comfortable with small talk as some people are . 
  normally small talk has some sort of purpose instead of just being a pleasantry . 
  for instance , if you run into your neighbour walking his dog early in the morning and he says something about the weather , he is probably genuinely curious if he should take his umbrella on his work commute instead of just saying something for the sake of politeness . 
  but of course this is just a generality . 
  you 'll find some finns who are so shy and awkward that they ca n't even say hello back to you on the street , but you 'll also find some who are masters at small talk . 
  and we do tend to get better at talking when we drink , but that probably goes for everyone . 
  some of us like cold and boring . 
  did n't snowden try to claim asylum in a bunch of different countries ? 
  i bet there are all sorts of crisis meetings going on at the moment . 
  what is camp of the saints ? 
   it makes it much easier to follow meta discussions . 
  it also makes it much easier to ignore them .
