  i have a thing about wasting food . 
  i will go out of my way to avoid throwing any food away . 
  one time i had a meal of red onions - only red onions with a dash of olive oil - because they were beginning to go bad and i could n't stand to throw them out . 
  if the worst thing you can complain about is the lack of elvis on the radio then things must not be too bad for you . 
   during the last glacial maximum , the adventure plateau -- the shallowest , north-western sector of the sicilian channel -- was connected to sicily , forming a broad peninsula that was separated from the north african coastline by about 30 miles ...  one of those islands was the pantelleria vecchia bank , where the massive monolith was found ...  everything ended about 9,500 years ago , when , according to the post-glacial curve of sea-level change for the italian coasts , seawater submerged pantelleria vecchia bank . 
  so this particular area was flooded by the rising sea . 
  i wish they had included a map in the article . 
  malta has some very old monoliths as well . 
  was this part of the same culture , i wonder ? 
  well , damn . 
  finland has dropped off the edge of the world . 
  i do n't think i like this idea . 
  i 'm surprised that you are so upset . 
  just calm down . 
  dude chill . 
  now you got so upset that you 're resorting to name calling . 
  go get a massage or something . 
  and you still have n't given any sources . 
  i suppose you could try to make up something . 
  that does n't address how aid affects population . 
   foreign aid to africa has allowed it 's population to reach unsustainable levels that are only going to increase massively . 
  what sources have you seen that suggest foreign aid has increased population ? 
  i 'm a bit dubious on cause and effect here . 
   yes , but they 'll need an accuracy of a few centimeters for that . 
  i do n't think here comes anywhere close to that . 
  here has been experimenting for some time . 
  i know some here people who said they have been doing it in germany for a while now . 
  last year ( or maybe two years ago ? ), 
  finland changed a law about autonomous vehicles . 
  the rumour was that nokia were testing them in winter conditions , or at least planned to . 
  so far most of this testing has been in dry conditions , like out in the american southwest by google . 
  supposedly there has n't been much done in winter conditions . 
  and for people who think the [ dish draining closet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dish_draining_closet ) is a joke answer , i can confirm that it is brilliant . 
  no more towel drying dishes like a goddamned savage . 
  i think the makers of that movie actually went to istanbul and apologised for how it portrayed turks . 
  but i think most people realise it is just fiction . 
  yes , i liked the movie . 
  i know it is fiction , and makes no attempt to portray turkey with any accuracy . 
  no , \u00c5land is farther to the south . 
  [ here ] ( http://research.ics.aalto.fi/eiml/images/baltic_salinity_animation2.gif ) is a cool animation showing salinity in the baltic sea area from [ aalto university ] ( http://research.ics.aalto.fi/eiml/research.shtml ) . 
  you can see how low the salinity is up in the north of the gulf of bothnia . 
  and the whole baltic area is a lot less salty [ than some of the world 's oceans . 
  ] ( http://www.salinityremotesensing.ifremer.fr/_/rsrc/1286917514134/sea-surface-salinity/salinity-distribution-at-the-ocean-surface/annual_clim.jpg?height=1641&amp;width=3015 ), 
  that 's a good question . 
  is n't there some sort of un treaty that governs this ? 
  i seem to remember reading something about it in relation to china 's land reclamation in the south china sea . 
  the land was smashed down by the huge glaciers during the last ice age . 
  after the glaciers melted the land is now springing back . 
  making us kiss sweden is like when great aunt bertha shows up and our mother forces us to give her a kiss without shuddering . 
  no offence , sweden . 
   turkey = terrifying prisons woah . 
  a midnight express reference ? 
  that was such a good movie . 
  i 'd like to see it again . 
  the high coast / kvarken archipelago is a pretty cool area , and if you are ever visiting this part of europe you should check it out . 
  at the present rate of uplift they think the land bridge will form in about 2,500 years . 
  currently about [ 1 square kilometre of land rises from the sea every year ] ( http://www.kvarkenworldheritage.fi/the-kvarken-archipelago/ ) . 
  you can see a [ before and after photo here ] ( http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=199530&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ) of some of the change . 
  it is a [ unesco world heritage site ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/898 ) . 
  that 's fantastic . 
  it seems to really fit , too : i could definitely imagine sheep frolicking around on some green hillside when i listened to that music . 
  i do n't know , man , but when i saw you telling another subreddit to [ `` hit '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3esfqx/reurope_creates_a_immigration_megathread_which/ctiqjsk ) this thread i wondered if it could come back to bite you . 
  is n't that brigading ? 
  was n't there another one there a couple of years ago , or am i imagining things ? 
  well , [ sweden ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24635791 ) thought similarly . 
  they offered permanent residency to syrians seeking asylum . 
  i thought if i deleted it would leave the post but delete my name as op ? 
  i thought i should take responsibility for my mistake and not bail out . 
  that 's why i did n't delete it . 
  i honestly thought that was what the tents were for . 
  when i opened up the picture i did n't know there was a long caption at the bottom which explained what the tents were for . 
  / u/vladraptor pointed out my mistake . 
  i 'd fix the title if i could but as far as i know reddit does n't allow that . 
  seriously , my apologies . 
  well , cock . 
  believe it or not , i did n't realise there was text underneath that picture . 
  my apologies . 
  sources : [ helsinki olympics ] ( http://lauttasaarensaatio.fi/historiikki ) and [ london olympics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_village,_london ), 
  think of all the poor people who live on turkey 's coasts . 
  they go from sunny mediterranean paradises to the cold , rainy northern atlantic . 
  that is interesting as well . 
  what do those who are ideologically opposed to the campaign do ? 
  do they try to organise and mount a resistance , or do they continue to fight individually , or maybe even give up ? 
  and what do the administrators / moderators do ? 
  how do they react , what tools do they use ? 
  it 's not just misinformation . 
  it is creating doubt , silencing opposition , convincing the unsure , nudging the public discussion one way and not the other . 
  it is citing legitimate sources where appropriate , and citing dubious sources where appropriate . 
  it is using politeness and rational logic to those unsure , and furious insults to those ideologically opposed . 
  i think the whole process is rather interesting . 
  i 'm not here to engage with them . 
  i do n't care if they want to engage in ( mis ) information campaigns . 
  to be honest , i think it is interesting to watch their activities and think about their motivation , even though i 'm not interested in their message . 
  the manipulation of online discussions is kind of fascinating . 
  but if i was a mod it would be a different story . 
  the mods feel they need to act in some manner , and they probably are a bit peeved that the forum is being used for specific agendas . 
  so i feel a bit of sympathy for them . 
  prove who wrong ? 
  dude , he deleted and backed out . 
  put your pitchfork away and let him go .
