  you have a lot of links in there . 
  perhaps the bot thinks you are a bot spamming . 
  i do n't like this idea either , but i have the suspicion the mods are fighting a semi-organised influx . 
  if you look in some other european subreddits and related chats there appears to be a bit of brigading going on . 
  / r/europe is being specifically targeted by people with an agenda . 
  from the [ times of malta  ( http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150724/local/giant-sliema-mural-to-have-second-part-and-a-message-in-north-italy.577827 )  an artist who painted a stunning graffiti mural which has been turning heads in sliema intends to complete the piece in northern italy in a couple of weeks . 
  the four-storey high mural shows a man scrambling into a hole in a wall of a building , adjacent to the regina car park . 
   many on the way to bisazza street have stopped to marvel at the piece , wondering whether there is a story to the grey man in red shorts and flip-flops . 
  it took the french artist , who goes by the name mto , three days to complete the mural , which formed a part of the sliema arts festival . 
   asked about his piece , he told this newspaper to `` wait a week or two ... you will understand '' . 
  but pierre portelli , who chairs the festival committee , said the other part of the mural will show the man coming out of a wall in an as yet unspecified building in the north of italy . 
  it is meant to portray the struggle of migrants who leave southern shores and head to northern europe in search of a better life . 
  it looks like he is agreeing with the poster . 
  i 'm not sure why / u/dclauzel is being downvoted - it seems like he agrees there is an issue with the tag and is listening to feedback . 
  why is he being downvoted for that ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  the same thing used to happen here . 
  two elections ago the finns party did very well , but every other party agreed to exclude them . 
  since then the finns worked pretty hard at kicking down their obviously racist members and acting responsible . 
  yes , i think there should be a level at which the income tax kicks in and everything below that would be untaxed . 
  if we use the poverty rate , that would be $ 14,400 . 
  the finns party in finland used to be considered so outrageous that no other party would work with them , but they rehabilitated themselves and are now in government . 
  i wonder if the same thing could happen with the sweden democrats . 
   remove vat . 
  replace it with sales tax why is this ? 
  what kind of benefits would this bring ? 
   people are tired of all the alcohol tourism from ... finland ... and the belligerence the tanked tourists often display . 
  sorry about that . 
  does n't the uk have any sort of vocational school system ? 
  how does it work now if someone wants to be a plumber , for instance , or any other of those examples you mentioned ? 
  was that a stealth promotion to the nordic region ? 
  well , even a stealth promotion is a promotion . 
  * reform pension system to have a retirement age based upon life expectancy * reform labour market to allow employers more flexibility in hiring and firing * across the board flat tax rate of 23 % ( vat , corporate income , personal income , capital gains ) * implement a basic income for citizens and get rid of all other social support programs . 
  i 'd like to see it set at $ 1200 per month ( approximately the poverty rate in finland , as defined by oecd ) but we 'd need to be careful about the effect on the budget . 
  * privatise a lot of the state 's unnecessary assets , like liquor stores , stocks in airlines , telecoms and real estate companies . 
  * implement a base-pay plus bonus system for major public officials like mps . 
  for instance , pay them the average per capita gdp , but they can get bonuses for achieving various public welfare goals , like reducing the unemployment rate , getting more people to graduate university , reducing the alcoholism rate , increasing the use of renewable energy , etc. 
  hopefully none . 
  people should have a right to say what they want , even if - or especially if - it is contrary to popular opinion . 
  everyone on the planet should read kafka 's metamorphosis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_metamorphosis . 
  it is about a young man who wakes up one morning to find that he is an insect ( or bug , vermin of some sort ) . 
  the whole premise is interesting , but the best thing about it is the character 's relationship with his family . 
  the stranger is fantastic . 
  i recently re-read it . 
  no [ michel houellebecq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_houellebecq ) ? 
  from his recent work , i really enjoyed [ the map and the territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_map_and_the_territory ) . 
  then suomission https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soumission_ ( novel ) is about a future islamic france and has generated a lot of controversy . 
  i have n't read this yet , but it is on my list . 
  from finland : ** v\u00e4in\u00f6 linna ** the unknown soldier https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_unknown_soldier_ ( novel ) this was published in 1957 and is about machine gunners in the continuation war . 
  a brand new english translation just came out this year . 
  it is supposed to be really good , but i have n't seen it yet . 
  * the unknown soldier * is also the sequel ( although it was published first ) of linna 's [ under the northern star ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/under_the_north_star_trilogy ) , which is also very respected . 
  it follows a family throughout several generations of finnish history . 
  the finnish civil war features prominently . 
  ** mika waltari ** [ the egyptian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_egyptian ) this historical novel is about a physician in ancient egypt . 
  it was published in 1945 and made into a movie in america . 
  today there is even a finnish bread named after it . 
  ** tove jansson ** [ finn family moomintrolll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finn_family_moomintroll ) the moomins first appeared right after the end of wwii . 
  this is the third book jansson published and was one of the first to be popular internationally . 
  ** sofi oksanen ** purge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purge_ ( novel ) oksanen is pretty controversial -- some people seem to love her and some seem to hate her . 
  personally , i love this book . 
  * purge * came out in 2008 and is about women struggling under soviet occupation in estonia . 
  for a while ( maybe it is still the case ) oksanen outsold ** dan brown ** in france . 
  ** emmi it\u00e4ranta ** wrote [ memory of water ] ( http://www.amazon.com/memory-water-novel-emmi-it%c3%a4ranta/dp/0062326155 ) simultaneously in both english and finnish . 
  this is a 2014 dystopian novel about a young tea master . 
  she lives in what used to be finland but is now controlled by china . 
  a heavy-handed autocratic government strictly controls the use of fresh water , which is a rare commodity thanks to climate change . 
  edit : there seems to be parentheses in the unknown soldier and purge urls , so reddit wo n't accept the links . 
  i would put knausg\u00e5rd there right now . 
  that 's interesting . 
  try searching jstor or google scholar . 
  if people thought they would be redeemed at face value , the market would maintain the peg . 
  but i doubt many people would have believed that so i bet they would have fallen in value . 
  it depends a lot on where they would be accepted , too . 
  i do n't think greece could declare them legal tender because of the euro treaties . 
  so they would be unofficial . 
   `` it 's not true we did not have a plan b. 
  we had a plan b. '', 
   `` we , in the ministry of finance , developed it . 
  under the egis of the prime minister , who ordered us to do this , even before we came in the ministry of finance . '', 
   `` of course , you realize that these plans -- plan bs -- are always , by definition , highly imperfect , because they have to be kept within a very small circle of people , otherwise if they leak , a self-fulfilling prophecy emerges . '', 
   that plan , he said , was not for greece to leave the eurozone , a grexit , but rather for the government to create `` euro-denominated currency '' -- in other words , for the government to print its own , temporary currency , pegged to the value of the euro . 
   `` the fact of the matter is that that plan b was not energized -- i did n't get the green light to effect it , to push the button , if you want . '', 
   that , he said , was one of the `` main reasons why i resigned . '', 
  so this basically sounds like the ious california used , and what various commentators said greece should use . 
  if they were temporary then the idea would have been for them to be redeemed for euros at some point in the future . 
  the bailout is only for 3 years , if it lasts that long . 
  he was a ferrari academy driver and i was certain he would replace r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen eventually . 
  it 's a sad day . 
  this is interesting to see such an early explanation of how the word came to be used in english . 
  here is what the oxford english dictionary says :  ** camouflage ** / noun & verb . 
  [ origin french , from * camoufler * verb ( thieves ' slang ) from italian * camuffare * disguise , deceive , perh . 
  with french * camouflet * whiff of smoke in the face ), 
  and [ hesburger ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/hesburger ) has 279 in finland . 
  so this must only show american fastfood restaurants , for some inexplicable reason . 
  i 'd like to know how this was compiled . 
  turnover ? 
  number of stores ( company or franchise-owned ? ) ? 
  number of customers ? 
  until i see a source i 'm calling bullshit .
