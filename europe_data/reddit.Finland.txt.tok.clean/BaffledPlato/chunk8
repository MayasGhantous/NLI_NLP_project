  we expect on having cold and rain ruin our may day or midsummer holidays . 
  in a way , we expected nokia to fail . 
  but that is fine because we go on . 
  dealing with hardship is what defines finnishness , and we need that hardship to be finns . 
  in fact , there is a bit of unquenchable optimism in the finnish national character that we do n't like to acknowledge but are glad it is there . 
  we act like we are pessimists but we really are n't . 
  there is a famous finnish novel which starts : ` in the beginning , there was the swamp , the hoe - and jussi . ', 
  there is a huge problem that takes extraordinary labour , but that is fine . 
  jussi will take that hoe and drain that swamp and it will all be okay in the end . 
  i ca n't help but notice that ` lender of last resort ' is missing in their list of objectives . 
  i suppose the banks already took a hit when the private creditors took a haircut . 
  and perhaps the ecb 's move on collateral in regards to the ela was more of a political message ? 
  unfortunately , i believe this . 
  last autumn only [ alpha bank ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/26/uk-eu-banks-greece-idukkbn0if0oi20141026 ) passed a stress test . 
  at that time pireaus was short $ 659.9 million , while national bank was short $ 3.43 billion and eurobank needed $ 4.63 billion . 
  since then they have lost a ton of deposits and had the market value of the greek debt they hold fall . 
  i would hate to see the results of a stress test at this moment . 
   according to ipsas , the greeks are supposed to be able to value their restructured debt at the market value on the day the debt was incurred ... 
  but instead , the greek debt is counted on face value -- the value of the debt when it was first issued , ignoring all the restructuring revaluations now on the books . 
  i 'm confused . 
  are they saying the haircut the private investors took are n't on the books ? 
  i do n't think that is correct , because the official debt figures fell . 
  also , the market value of the debt has fallen because there is doubt it can be repaid , but the terms of the debt is still the same . 
  if i borrow $ 100 and my creditor sells the loan to a third party for $ 50 , i still owe $ 100 , not $ 50 . 
  i wish politico showed their work to get to their conclusion , because based on this article it is n't making any sense to me . 
  i have had so many nokia / microsoft friends move away . 
  they have taken jobs in germany or london or stockholm or silicon valley . 
  one even moved to moscow . 
  i wonder how much technological brain-drain finland is experiencing . 
  once we had all these bright international minds coming to work here , and now we are not only losing the expats but also all our domestic talents . 
   last tranche of emergency liquidity asssistance ( ela ) is about to run out do we have any idea how much ela greek banks can still access ? 
  i 'm wondering if they will simply run out of liquidity before a deal can be reached . 
  um , if they have it and the eurogroup needs to see it , why are they waiting ? 
  to see how people like only being able to withdraw $ 60 for yet another day ? 
  satire has a long and noble history in literature , news and social criticism . 
  ancient writers like horace and juvenal turned a critical and intelligent eye on the politics and society of ancient rome . 
  in the early modern period we have jonathan swift 's gulliver 's travels which is still a classic after 290 years . 
  in the postwar era there is joseph heller 's catch-22 which is one of the greatest war / anti-war novels ever written . 
  now is the daily mash of the same quality as george orwell 's animal farm ? 
  probably not , but a lot of satire is directed to current events . 
  the situation in greece is changing daily , if not hourly , and the best method to communicate these satiric messages with today 's technology is online . 
  have their been polls in other countries to see what their citizens think of the bailout programmes ? 
  i mean , do germans or french or whoever approve of their tax money being used in the bailouts ? 
  i tried googling but could n't find anything . 
  man , has he ever heard of a poor winner ? 
  they should be conciliatory and gracious in winning the referendum . 
  after all , they still need a deal with their creditors . 
  is this inflammatory talk going to do any good ? 
  it 's like insulting your loan officer at the bank . 
  if you need a loan maybe a better approach would be simply to say the bank 's terms were unacceptable and suggesting new ones . 
   reading the blog post probably helps . 
  i did . 
   i was made aware of a certain preference by some eurogroup participants , and assorted ` partners ' , for my ... ` absence ' from its meetings ; an idea that the prime minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement . 
  so the eurogroup creditors wanted him out , and his boss thought that this could help get a deal . 
  so it sounds like a bone thrown to the creditors , like i suggested . 
  i thought he said he would resign in the event of a yes vote . 
  he was in favour of a no vote . 
  woah . 
  i did n't expect this . 
  perhaps this is a bone thrown to the creditors . 
  why is it stupid ? 
  you 're exactly right , and the funny thing is that nobody knew what would happen under the bailout . 
  the first projections had greece [ returning to growth in 2012 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dxrfs#2eox3hb ) !, 
  the whole situation is something new , and no one knew what to expect ( or if they did , they were drowned out in the crowd ) . 
   one of the great risks if the greek public votes yes -- that is , votes to accept the demands of the creditors , and hence repudiates the greek government 's position and probably brings the government down -- is that it will empower and encourage the architects of european failure . 
  the creditors will have demonstrated their strength , their ability to humiliate anyone who challenges demands for austerity without end . 
  and they will continue to claim that imposing mass unemployment is the only responsible course of action . 
  he has a point , but it would be necessary to significantly change the fundamentals behind the eu . 
  we are currently forbidden to be a ` transfer union , ' even though i think we should be . 
  and here i was wishing you had given a hint of the contents in the title . 
  i passed it by without opening it at first . 
  definitely . 
  in a way , the market is already jittery . 
  if you compare [ 10-year government bond yields ] ( http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-govtbonds.html ) of one month ago and today you can see yields falling in safer countries like france and germany and rising in countries which are seen to have more problems like spain and italy . 
  this means money is flowing from the bonds of the periphery nations to the core . 
  investors are demanding a higher yield to hold italian bonds because they think it is more risky . 
  in a worst case scenario investors will quite suddenly refuse to lend to these periphery eurozone members . 
  it will be extremely expensive to borrow on the open market , if they can do so at all . 
  this is exactly what happened to greece and why they had to find alternate sources of funding . 
  meanwhile , google trends says greece is the # 1 region for [ bitcoin searches ] ( https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin&amp;date=now%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=etc%2fgmt-3 ) over the past week . 
  they do n't have to print them in greece . 
  in 2012 [ the british printing company de la rue was apparently ready to print drachmas . 
  ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/uk-delarue-greece-idukbre84h0dh20120518 ) evidently de la rue prints 150 different currencies , so apparently it is quite common for countries to outsource . 
  and finland had a higher gnp per capita than sweden in 1880 , when we were part of the russian empire . 
  that surprised me . 
   the fourth sba review in july 2011 projected $ 50 billion to materialize [ from privatisations ] through end -- 2015 . 
  actual receipts through the first quarter of 2015 were $ 3.2 billion , about ** 94 percent below the target ** . 
  these were based on asset sales that were the easiest to sell ( least socially and politically sensitive and with fewer legal obstacles ) , whereas none of the more sensitive infrastructure assets ( airports , ports , rail , utilities ) that dominate the remaining privatization portfolio were sold . 
  so what is going wrong with privatisations ? 
  is the government unwilling to sell off state assets , or private investors unwilling to buy them , or a bit of both ? 
  there is nothing more terrifying to a dictator than a non-binding resolution . 
  what statistics would you suggest to use ? 
  it has been [ unseasonably cool here in finland ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/no_heat_wave_for_june/8109806 ) , but it has started to warm up . 
  the [ forecasts ] ( http://sv.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/vader/helsingfors ) say it will be 23 today and 26 tomorrow in helsinki . 
  i 'm watching two very fluffy landseer puppies who are finding the heat more difficult than i am . 
  they compete over who gets to lay under the window with the best breeze . 
   instead it 'll probably be a `` do you like merkel y/n '' vote , which is pretty sad no matter what the outcome is . 
  the greek pirate party [ is portraying it as almost exactly that . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/piratenpartij/status/615853998889902081 ), 
   i am still hopeful that something will still be salvaged in upcoming days .
