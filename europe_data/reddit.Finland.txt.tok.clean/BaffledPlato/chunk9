  greece has already once [ called a referendum on the bailout and then cancelled it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_proposed_economy_referendum,_2011 ) . 
  i suspect there are frantic negotiations going on as we speak , trying to get a deal struck before the referendum . 
  by the way , go take a look at / r/sweden . 
  even if you do n't understand swedish i think you 'll understand the jubilation . 
  [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yfnhpzw.png ) is one screenshot of the subreddit i stole from / u/dayumgurl1 . 
   the foreign ministry said the new measures would not include regular stops or passport checks . 
  it will be interesting to see what exactly these controls are . 
  random stops ? 
  i think we need to have some sort of comprehensive , long-term solution to the migrant problem . 
  if not , countries are going to be resorting to these border controls more and more . 
  regardless of the schengen rules , countries still have a lot of leeway to control their borders . 
  if european countries start using these measures against each other we will have a problem . 
  you would think so , but that 's not how they did it . 
  for example , [ look at page 16 of the 2012 bailout ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2012/pdf/ocp94_en.pdf ) . 
  their scenario starts in 2009 . 
  i am guessing this is because past statistics were being revised as they went . 
  so they are , in effect , guessing what happened in the past before final statistics were released . 
  simultaneously they are making predictions about the future . 
  i decided to check what the troika expected would happen due to the greek bailouts , and what actually happened . 
  government finances and the real economy were much worse than forecasted . 
  sources : forecasted figures : [ the economic adjustment programme for greece -- may 2010 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2010/pdf/ocp61_en.pdf ) [ the second economic adjustment programme for greece -- march 2012 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2012/pdf/ocp94_en.pdf ) actual statistics : [ real gdp growth rate -- eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;plugin=1 ) [ unemployment rate -- eurostat ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=une_rt_a&amp;lang=en ) [ government gross debt 2011-2014 eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;plugin=1 ) [ government debt 2009-2010 -- oecd ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm ) [ government deficit 2011-2014 -- eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teina200 ) [ government deficit 2009-2010 -- oecd ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-deficit.htm ) by the way , you might notice that the oecd and eurostat numbers do n't always add up . 
  i suspect that is because there are revisions to the statistics going on . 
  if it is a military coup it is even less likely to be internationally recognised . 
  if they want to cut a deal with russia they could join the eurasian union and become another south ossetia or donetsk people 's republic . 
  i 'm not sure if russia would be able to prop it up financially , though . 
   furthermore , why would they need to have money deposited at greek banks in the first place ? 
  well , if they were doing business in greece they would have to have money for capital expenditures or regular operating cash for local operations ( paying suppliers and workers and so on ) . 
  but if the stock of fdi ( i assume you do n't mean flow ) was only $ 2 billion there must not have been a lot of foreign money in greece by 2013 . 
  the problem in this argument is international recognition . 
  you ca n't just declare a new state . 
  international countries and organisations - particularly the creditor countries - would have to recognise greece as a new state and acknowledge that all previous debt has been cleared . 
  if they refuse to recognise a new state , there are all sorts of things creditor countries could do . 
  they could sue greece in various courts , which could order the seizure of greek assets abroad ( just like what happened to argentina when it went bankrupt ) . 
  they could refuse to allow greece into international organisations like the un and refuse to allow greece in trade zones or to use international financial markets . 
  greek passports could be refused to be honoured . 
  conceivably , in a worst case scenario , greece could be forced into a new north korea-like existence without international recognition , cut off from the rest of the world . 
  would this be preferable ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  do we know if all of that 100 billion was owned by greeks , or if some of it was owned by foreign investors , perhaps ? 
  negotiations do not imply accepting the other side 's proposal or any specific part of it . 
  negotiations mean trying to find a deal , but it is inevitable that each side will have their own demands they refuse to compromise on . 
  so there have been negotiations . 
  i think you have a good point about referendums , though . 
  europe seems a bit gunshy about them after what happened with the proposed constitution . 
  now they seem to try and avoid them if at all possible , while still pretending to be listening to the will of the people . 
  to paraphrase the old saying , democracy is a terrible form of government but it is the best we can do . 
   as far is i know the ecb can only give ela to solvent banks . 
  yes , but i believe the ecb itself decides on what is ` solvent . ', 
  they already changed their rules about the quality of the bonds they hold as collateral . 
  as greek bonds had their ratings cut and cut , the ecb changed their definition so they could continue holding those bonds . 
  but did n't syriza win the election because the people did n't want the plan - basically they were voting ` no ' to the bailout plan at that time ? 
  it does n't seem to be too terrible . 
  as i write this the euro is down only .46 % against the usd . 
  the stock markets are taking a beating , but even that is n't as bad as pessimism suggested . 
  there seems to be a flight to quality in government bonds , with italy , portugal and spain yields jumping and german bunds falling . 
  it looks like finnish and french bonds are attracting investors , too . 
  thanks for posting a link to the actual budget . 
  you see all kinds of numbers tossed around from tons of different sources so it is nice to see the real numbers . 
  this is off-topic , but i 'm beginning to be quite impressed with soini turning down the finance minister role and letting stubb have it . 
  that is one thankless and hated job at the moment . 
  so is that just a goal , or is it an actual forecast ? 
   greece as of 2015 has a budget surplus of 4 % . 
  this is interesting . 
  is this a primary surplus , or a complete budget surplus ? 
  do you have any more information on this ? 
  i think you are looking too far ahead . 
  i see no reason to think greece will enter into an alliance with russia . 
  what could russia offer ? 
  they do n't have the money to just toss around . 
  maybe if oil was 120 usd a barrel , but not when it is around 60 . 
  tsipras has said greece would remain part of europe no matter what happened , and i think he 's right . 
  maybe a last minute deal will happen . 
  maybe they will leave the eurozone but remain in the eea like norway . 
  there are many more likely scenarios to consider than a russian-greek alliance . 
   the majority of people including me , ca n't comprehend what a possible return to drachma means i do n't think anyone knows . 
  paul krugman , a nobel winner in economics , has been on the record in the past as not knowing what could happen . 
  if even professional economists are clueless , then it really is a jump into the unknown . 
  but he has to get out of the embassy while the uk is actively trying to catch him . 
  does n't assange already have asylum in ecuador ? 
  he would face the same problem if he was granted asylum in france : getting there . 
  snowden would have a similar problem in getting to france . 
  he would have to travel over or through countries that would try to capture him . 
  maybe i 'm being cynical , but perhaps the justice minister is just saying this to piss off the americans because they spied on the french . 
  yes . 
  apparently [ courtney love cobain ] ( https://twitter.com/courtney/status/614022179978502146 ) live-tweeted her experience . 
   greece will default on its $ 324bn sovereign debt for a third time . 
  what 's at stake this week in brussels is whether this is done by agreement or disagreement . 
  that is a nice , succinct way of putting it . 
  greece 's debt is unsusustainable at present and the only question is when and how it will default . 
   if greece is kicked out of , or departs , the euro currency , it 's inevitable over the medium term that the currency will appreciate in value . 
  i 'm not sure about this , but i guess it depends upon what ` medium term ' is . 
  i would think the value of the euro would fall because questions would arise about the willingness of europe to sustain the common currency . 
   the cornerstone of industrial policy here is the competitive low 12.5 pc corporation tax regime ... 
  this results in about 250,000 jobs . 
  france wants to scrap it ... we could be equally isolated and victimised into submission on tax policy . 
  ireland should be worried about this . 
  some countries do n't like this at all . 
  even some finnish politicians wanted to force ireland to raise their corporate tax rates back during ireland 's bailout . 
   french and german banks were saved ; the tab was put onto irish national debt . 
  a bit too simplistic , and a bit too disingenuous .
