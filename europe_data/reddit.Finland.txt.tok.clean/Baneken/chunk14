  in finland . 
  i.e a new car costs 100 000 $ and you buy one from germany as used for 20k in the minds of toll office you are gaining 80k advantage and they then priced your import according to that value with almost no rights for you to petition or straighten it . 
  jumper , jumpy is n't a `` real '' van to me . 
  i 've no use for something as tiny as jumpy . 
  in all honesty what i would have liked was a small lorry but due to bureaucratic and fiscal reason i bought the next best thing and i 've been happy with it . 
  speaking of sizes in mercator projection `` the great lakes '' in america in rl are near equal or even larger in size and shape to gulf of bothnia and the entire baltic sea in general . 
  for comparison http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!mtuymdcxmte.mti2njeymju*mtm1mdyznzi ( nje5odi2nw ~ ! contiguous_us * mtawmjqwnzu.mjuwmjm1mtc ( mtc1 ) mg ~ ! in * nti2nda1mq.nzg2mzqymq ) ma ~ ! cn * otkymty5nw.nzmxndcwnq ( mji1 ) mq ~ ! fi * njiyotkwng.mti4mdkyntc ) ma, 
  that you have to have every single maintenance per year as in the books for 8 years in a row and then some to prove that the fault was the makers and not you keeping a proper care of your car . 
  that 's a known fad ( or fetish ? ), 
  about girls paying their taxi fees with sex as if a taxi drive would cost more then a proper prostitute and not some skank . 
  city mode turns the wooden feel of the electric power steering to worse by making it feel nothing when you turn it this supposedly help when parking in the city or some such nonsense as if you would need strength to turn that already ` with a pinky ' - turning wheel . 
  l\u00f6tk\u00f6 is the word i 'm looking for but english has no word for a feel that feels mushy and soft and well pliable like an earthworm when you turn it . 
  also 20 year old imports get the same treatment in finland though eu eventually said no and the finnish customs fought with a fury of a thousand winters against it and lost but not without doing everything they can to now stall the inevitability of having to pay back the taxes collected . 
  i remember when my father sold his in the 90 's and only thing that the guy dealing them back to east was concerned about was whether the driver side window crank was still working . 
  well the new vans from peugeot , citroen and fiat are great though ca n't say about that other brand from renault , opel and nissan ( ? ), 
  or at least i 've been happy with my citroen van for the past 7 months or so now . 
  well they are a subsidiary of vw after all and frankly skodas are a far cry from what they used to be in both price and quality . 
  though i 'm a bit surprised who much japs have lost their ground in eu , ~ ~ nissan ~ ~ toyota used to be the nr1 in finland for years . 
  no it would mean that the west would just have to invade the suwalki gap part of belarussia first either way ol' luca would be utterly fucked by either party . 
  mainly because diplomatically belarussia could n't side with the west nor could it side with the russians without immediate escalation of the conflict . 
  you forgot that finland has a 1500km 's of land border with russia that would have to be looked after in case of war in europe ? 
  not to mention that most of the russian northern air bases are next to finnish border near or in kuola . 
  germany is a bad comparison because they essentially lost because hitler was a fucking imbecile when it comes to dictating strategy over your own self bloated ego . 
  hitler for instance ordered his generals to halt attack in dunkerque thus allowing a 100 000 allied troops to escape back to britain just because he felt he needed to show his generals who is the boss , same with stalingrad and the whole east thing in general . 
  because it 's not an insult but a proven russian governmental occupation these days ? 
  i do n't know why you should feel salty over it as a canadian . 
  that 's what americans excel at : selling and marketing someone else inventions as their own . 
  linux was developed in finland by linus torvalds . 
  he later moved to work at silicon valley in california which is probably why you erronously think that linux would be american invention . 
  unix ( in which linux is based on ) however is another matter . 
  i forgot kizhi island ... that 's in karelia . 
  well worth seeing but other than that the oblast is still in terrible shape for the most part and really not something were a western tourist usually wants to go except ` adventuring ' . 
  thanks for being a good sport , shill . 
  because you said that russians do n't like ** religious sects ** in russia yet your government clearly favors orthodox christian sects while persecuting other christian sects . 
  well ... nixon wanted to nuke vietnam but kissinger talked him out of it by pointing out how bad it would be for his approval ratings . 
  ahem , it was russians muscling in on sweden 's territory first - or rather novgorod since russia as it 's now understood did n't even exist before muscovites conquered the rest of the principalities after 1500 and started waging their wars and constant expansion in expense of tatars , polish , sibirs and what not . 
  well then , do n't go to karelia you might be a bit disappointed with the level of `` preservation '' ... 
  that 's why you keep an axe & firewood in the trunk and hope someone comes by eventually ... 
  some mammoth bones have been found but nothing like the huge bone mounds you can find in siberia . 
  but orthodox christian doom 's day cult 's are apparently a-okay ? 
  in finland police raided a camp of the romanian gypsies on the suspicion of them trafficking with stolen goods and permanently camping on private property without leave and the police recovered over 50 000 $ worth of stolen property . 
  unfortunately the gypsies ca n't be prosecuted other than being fined because naturally nobody admitted ` owning ' any of the goods recovered . 
  well looks like she was n't picked because of those brains for sure . 
  is there really fish that close to shore ? 
  and mandatory in finnish building code since the 60 's . 
  besides putin like potus is a man who simply ** can not ** be allowed to have ` accidental ' meetings with joe randomsky on the streets . 
  the security risk of some nutjob trying to stab/shoot/assault him with a cake is just too damn high . 
  i 'm not sure why greeks are worrying , that tiny speck of white should be gone by mid day noon . 
  yes . 
  yes well already we know this to be a thing . 
  * turkish leader adnan menderes considered cyprus an `` extension of anatolia '' , rejected the partition of cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to turkey . 
  well , pollen from bog samples indicate beech growing as far north as vaasa at least some 5000 years ago and today beech would be fighting for survival even in green house in finland ... oak does n't naturally occur except at the warm moraine ridges at the southernmost coast , ash meagerly reaches pori-joensuu line as single trees and elms are slowly dying out because its almost too cold for them to germinate and make seed properly in the wild . 
  to give n even more ` hilarious ' example of how much colder the climate is in the ` real north ' compared to denmark & norway . 
  there 's only one living plane tree in finland and that 's in helsinki botanic garden and the most popular cultivated christmas tree of denmark - caucasian fir ca n't be grown at all here . 
  if anything it would be the turks doing it . 
  especially under someone like erdogan . 
  well , the dogs and cats also help to keep rat population at bay . 
  so it 's a bit of win win for both to look after the dog living in your back alley . 
  tammi is also a stave and/or wagon axle because the best axles were made from oak which is the strongest and heaviest wood in finland after yew which only grows as a rare refuge in \u00c5land . 
  though probably the original meaning is ` napa ' - pivoting point . 
   burning desert wasteland well erdogan has certainly been keeping that image alive . 
  i was about to say it looks pretty normal monday morning then i noticed that it 's in istanbul . 
  yeah , i forgot they even had that little swimming pool . 
  they will get bored ... which will fuel all kinds of ` entertainment ' - based industries though i 'd like it would make people study more rather than going to the movies or dinner . 
  yeah , ww-iii is really not an ideal option ... 
  though i really would n't mind if this huge influx of `` free time '' would lead to second renaissance or similar . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'll be seeing the rise of `` neo luddite '' - movement when automation gets this far . 
  and we agreed to their offer of armistice because we were running out on ammunition not the will to fight . 
  during the winters of -39 -43 it was so cold that a big semi truck 's radiator would freeze over while engine was running if the wind was strong ... 
  what i think i like the most about these little towns of italy is their timeless quality . 
  there 's no rush to be somewhere else , life goes on and there will be tomorrow even if you 're not running to make it ready . 
  it 's okay they leaving anyway . 
  probably a collective double face palm and a tired * sigh *, 
  to fight the climate change ofc . 
  it was +8.9 c here in new years eve day ... and it worked , it 's snowing now . 
  bloody extremists ... 
  they 've no grasp for holiday spirit it seems . 
  it was +8.7 here , warmest new year in record . 
  [ fireworks ] ( https://vimeo.com/197640260 ) from my hometown celebrating the 100th year of finnish independence . 
  i 've actually seen click bait titles `` has the third world war already begun ? '', 
  i 'd hazard it 's from germany , probably one of the lower mountain ranges at middle germany . 
  yeah , judging from the style they 're from mid-medieval to late renaissance . 
  well it 's an old russian tradition to make laws that have such a large holes that you could drive a heard of elephants through them and claim that you 're following the law when your opposition gets to spend some refreshing outdoor living in the gulag . 
  with the end result that only illegal ones will stay for sure ... 
  we have ethnic russian minority in finland as well - ` tatars ' and they do n't steal or do crimes . 
  i suspect that the main reason lies in soviet settlement policy . 
  it created a whole class of rootless people who had only state and workplace left as their social construct . 
  under such circumstances it 's not very surprising that many joined to criminal gangs and other crimes when su collapsed . 
  on the other hand one could argue that english is such a mongrel of a language that it could be related to any other language you can think of . 
  do n't forget all the village idiots we 've banished to eduskunta over the years . 
  with the way global climate is steadily warming up , who knows , things might change quite a bit in the coming decades . 
  though probably not quite that much in our lifetime that there would be any significant population increase . 
  well realistically old pomorsky krai is arable to the same degree as karelia because of white sea , it gets noticeably more continental when you get to perm oblast . 
  the unprofitability is precisely what has largely kept people from settling to siberia , there was never much pressure for russian peasants to cultivate there because back home it was more worthwhile to do it and there was still plenty of land left there . 
  and today when family farmers in almost any 1st world country are in financial trouble ... 
  there 's even less incentive to clear and settle siberia that say 100 or even 50 years ago . 
  try karelia for starters , its perfectly arable up to arctic circle same as most of siberia where the yearly mean temp . 
  is high enough . 
  just because that land is n't ploughed to fields or used as pasture does n't make it infertile or otherwise unsuitable for farming . 
  just not very profitable in most cases which is why most of siberia was never settled en mass despite tax exempts and plenty of available land .
