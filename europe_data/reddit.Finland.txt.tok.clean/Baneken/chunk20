  i.e you 're not allowed to destroy cemeteries , crucifixes etc. 
  and you 're not allowed to bomb synagogues , flame mosques or publicly yell ` hail satan ! ', 
  from nine to five via megaphones at sunday just because it 's ` black sabbath ' - day for your local satanistic sect . 
  i really fail to see anything objectionable about it and neither should you . 
  there 's a canvas canopy protecting the books from rain and sticky wisteria flowers . 
  there 's a square opening above the benches where the wisteria branches have been twined and guided to grow over it . 
  which interestingly overlaps quite a bit at the east with the finns of the oka & kama river basins . 
  merya and me\u0161t\u0161era people to be precise . 
  there 's nothing ` dumb ' about continents . 
  it 's based on science - plate tectonics to be precise , in fact just last moth it was proven that earth in fact has 8 continents not 7 . 
  does n't matter much because the new continent is fully under the sea though . 
  i guess it 's supposed to be `` romans in da house '', 
  aww , that so ... rational - i still keep my frog licking and ergot bread theory , it 's more fun . 
  someone must have eaten a poison dart frog by accident or something ... 
  i 've never understood how its possible that a north italian ca n't understand south italian yet they 're both classified as italian ... 
  particularly when the definition of differentiating languages from dialects is that they 're mutually unintelligible . 
  it 's a pagan tradition that celebrates spring & fertility in christian dressing . 
  egg = symbol of rebirth onions = symbol of rebirth rabbit = symbol of fertility , births at spring lamb = symbol of fertility , births at spring grass = starts growing around easter i.e green which again symbolizes fertility . 
  in short easter is a pagan germanic fertility/spring festival that was hi-jacked by some dude called jeebus by the virtue of getting himself killed at easter month . 
  so * m\u00f6rk\u00f6 * is officially groke in english ? 
  always though it was * boogie man *, 
  why would italians need to dub for two italian actors in italian movies ? 
  looks like a treefarm to me . 
  yeah , the only true no-go zones in finland are the border zone next to russia and stuff like the army 's field artillery training fields & garrison areas for obvious reasons . 
  how many forests do you have in finland and what are their names . 
  yeah , i get that in belgium there 's like zero ( real ) forest land left but ... how to convey in simple terms that your country is just one big forest ? 
  see for your self https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltlo-yj73v8, 
  so , what 's over 75 % alc vol . 
  as proof then ? 
  it was banned because it was believed that it caused hallucinations because of herbs in it and not because it was and is like 90 proof and artists drunk it like water . 
  = `` pull a cunt over your head ! '', 
  ja leiki lent\u00e4j\u00e4\u00e4 = and pretend to be a fly boy . 
  ( do n't ask cause i dunno either ), 
  lordi tried very hard to break internationally after their eurovision success but it seems like hard rock hallelujah is going to remain their only internationally recognized song . 
  buy almost exclusively discount food at super markets . 
  that 's actually correct though most natives would likely say min\u00e4 en osaa hyvin suomea . 
  actually , to confuse you even more it 's also perfectly fine standardized finnish if you just add a comma in front of torille . 
  * torille , tavataan * - to the market place , let 's gather/meet up . 
  90l * 1.26 $ / l = 113,4 $ and that 's diesel , gasoline would be 1,45 $ / l for 95e or something . 
  i have a citroen h2l3 jumper ( relay for brits ) . 
  huy hong ( the cock sriracha ) how ever does have a very strong garlic taste that has a tendency to ` attack ' if you use it with ` wrong ' food while some foods add kick to chili taste but the garlic vanishes . 
  we have the usual market variants and then we have the summer only variants that are sold from small kiosks only during the summer . 
  mainly [ these ] ( http://www.ingman.fi/resources/images/ingman-pehmyt-vanilja1607-943258.png ) and [ these ] ( http://www.p4.no/resize.ashx?path=/mmo/images/2013/8/d72061a8-9c0a-488c-9db0-5b6d9e3d22ad.jpg&amp;w=960 ), 
  spelling for the market place ? 
  ;p tavataan is both spelling and meeting . 
  a and e mean to and for so correct form is torill * a * tavataan , small but important mistake . 
  bad bot, 
  those two cost 38 000 $ in finland so big no for being cheap . 
  german cars tend to be on high end of the price range and often driven by obnoxious people who think they have a special right to drive faster then the rest of the traffic on a high way . 
  i 've shot with a 9mm pistol , 7.62 mm assault rifle , sako trg sniper rifle , law rocket ( kes ) , kvkk light machine gun and the pkm light machine gun and thrown a live grenade and at one pint with .22 and a shot gun and laid ( smart ) mines and claymores . 
  first were used in the conscription/rehearsal service and latter two when i was a kid . 
  i 'd say that 's a very politically correct han chinese way of thinking . 
  you 're still eligible to pay for the damages though you just ca n't be prosecuted in the court and in some cases moved to foster home as well depending what the social services think about your situation . 
  you do realize that there are murderers and there are axe murderers ? 
  yeah , ege is probably the most common along with ` ellu ' & ` esko ' also derisively eskobar was used for a short while - it has now mostly fallen out of use . 
  actual swimming pool is rather useless unless it 's in your basement otherwise it could be only used for ice swimming 6 months a year . 
  and many houses especially built in the 70 's have a one with the sauna in the basement , dunno why it 's characteristically the houses built in the 70 's but there you go . 
  looks like common response to ammonium chloride so i assume that tastes like that . 
  people should actually vote ... 
  but the problem with changes like this is that they 're so ` handy ' for the ruling elite that it takes an unusually civic minded government to re-appeal a former governments decision when it 's something like this . 
  the allure of the cookie jar is just too great . 
  yeah , what we use in finland as a ` coffee cup ' is a ` tea mug ' elsewhere ... 
  honestly , this kind of thing should cost them in the next elections ... 
  but since it seems to be part of `` the way things work '' in poland as you described . 
  they 'll probably lose barely even a few seats ... 
  in finland there would such an uproar that the prime minister 's cabinet would feel lucky to have a party left come next elections . 
  oh they 'll win them alright because nobody will be able to expose any kind of election frauds anymore ... 
  since the court is under the thumb of the sitting justice minister . 
  but hey , that ai n't your problem right ? 
  it 's never you who gets affected , it 's always some other poor smuck and you keep on believing it until * they * knock at your door too . 
  but maybe i 'm worrying for nothing . 
  pis would never abuse their new absolute power like that , right ? 
  so you 're totally okay with the fact that your supreme court can be sacked if it does n't do what the current government wants ? 
  thus making the justice system subjugated to the will of the parliament ... 
  yep , and in an average work day i for example drink 2 cups in the morning , 2 at first coffee break , then 1 or 2 at lunch , another 1 or 2 at the second break in the afternoon and then two more when i get home after 4pm . 
  that 's 8-10 cups/day , fairly average consumption in my opinion . 
  and your current government tries their damnest to sink you back ... 
  i hope your open protests will make them reconsider the proposed changes . 
  different genus and a trade battle that us won over whose blue berry is to be called blue berry . 
  depends on how crooked you are ... sacking people is very easy in finland if you know how to ` game ' the system , just cite the need for `` restructuring '' and start kicking people out . 
  in case of a single worker two written warnings is enough to be sacked immediately - though the details differ a bit between unions and can be escalated to be appealed at court . 
  during probational period of up to 6 months you can be laid off at any time . 
  i can track my family tree to the early 1700 's and the village where my family grave is has graves of seven generations buried there . 
  native english speakers speaking almost any language aside from english is pretty funny too . 
  what is a gypsy thriatlon ? 
  walk to swimming hall and drive back home with a bicycle . 
  finland has plenty of [ music festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aacugvmpaw ) during summer . 
  not in german kitchens obviously ? 
  kitchen is considered to be a furniture ie . 
  you take those with you when you move just like other cabinets . 
  [ coffee ] ( https://www.paulig.fi/sites/default/files/media/product%20images/big/juhla_mokka_kahvi_2016.png ) , [ bread ] ( http://www.ullanpakari.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kaurajuntta_pussi_hr.jpg ) , [ cheese ] ( https://www.valio.fi/mediafiles/d28f462c-9a02-431e-8bf0-79171358d249/ogimage ) and [ sausage ] ( https://hkruokatalo.studio.crasman.fi/pub/kuvat/tuotekuvat2/5709.jpg?c=thumb_500x ) under the cheese like a normal human being . 
  the everglades . 
  miami vice . 
  beaches , bitches and sand , the palm trees ? 
  must had been in bavaria in a table dancing salon -  10 a clock and like in a snap of a finger all the germans sobered up and time to go home , work work tomorrow , end of parties instantly . 
  then why do you ask in the first place , perhaps to fill the air with your mindless chatter ? 
  no you 're actually correct boil 8 minutes , no oil for barilla but for fake italian ( actually made in latvia ) you add oil . 
  6 italy . 
  not surprising when it says put oil in cooking water and hard boil for 10minutes in every single package even in those made in italy . 
  those would be in order of appearance : susi = wolf s\u00e4nky = a bed obvious german loanword for a wolf or a dog ( en hund in swedish ) which would never be used in finnish .
