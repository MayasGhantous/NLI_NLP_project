  vuode = bed then estonian has some strange choice of words such as r\u00e4\u00e4kym\u00e4 for talking which in finnish means sounds that baby or whining adult does when they cry annoyingly . 
  also raiskama which in finnish means exclusively raping a human but in estonian it means wasting , spoiling , pillaging et c. which is also a loan from german ( expanded usage that is ) . 
  so it 's mainly about little things like spelling and using words that would n't be used in finnish in that context and vice versa and copious amounts of foreign ( german ? ), 
  loan words . 
  fermented ... 
  proper sauerkraut does n't need vinegar to stay . 
  likely based on just quality excluding accessibility or costs . 
  quality wise us healthcare is excellent and well it better be if you have to pony up a grand just for a simple blood test . 
  wait wait what ** walnuts ** can be pickled ?!!, 
  normally you have the inner cup fastened to a wall with claws or screws , the innards are then fastened in to the cup and finally the face plate is screwed to innards . 
  pretty impossible to rip that out unless the wall is made of cardboard in which case you have bigger problems then loose electric hardware . 
  also t\u00e4ll ** a ** inen vs. t\u00e4ll ** \u00e4 ** inen i dunno if it 's my ff proof reading or me but i personally find the first one impossible to pronounce . 
  coffee . 
  in finnish the most obvious changes have been replacing fracture font with something readable in the papers and w -  v and some spelling changes that make old finnish sound like some is speaking with their teeth being smashed in ( considering this was in the middle ages it might not be too far off even ) other then that finnish has n't changed at all from the 1500 's it was first written down by agricola . 
  though what has changed are letters that represent the sounds so : http://www.kolumbus.fi/juha.seppanen/opinnot/ue/agricola/abc.html  oppe nyt wanha / ia noori / ** oppii nyt vanha ja nuori **  joilla ombi sydhen toori . 
  ** alku oppi ilman estett\u00e4 **  nijte muista elemes aina / ** n\u00e4it\u00e4 muista el\u00e4m\u00e4ss\u00e4 aina **  nin jesus sinun armons laina ** niin jeesus sinulle armonsa lainaa ** is barely readable today but sounds understandable if you read it out loud . 
  oh that 's a latin loan ? 
  we have `` linja '' in finnish as well meaning exactly the same as in polish . 
  it 's more likely to be a bastardized version of tornedal finnish that bastardized the original saame name ... 
  might help if you english had n't dropped those certain sounds from all but living memory of the residents when you updated your spelling some time in the early 1900 's . 
  that 's because those are n't individual letters at all but sounds and some imbeciles long past have thought that it would be awesome to write welsh without any of it 's actual phonetics . 
  the swedish people party they have been in all the governments for the past 60 ( ? ), 
  years but this time they got left out . 
  trade schools have 1-3 where 3 is the highest ( and almost never given btw . ), 
  and 1 is simply that you passed the module . 
  actually kela pays approx . 
  560 $ unemployment fee after mandatory 20 % reduction as taxes and then onanates over how big the original 750 $ sum was should anyone in eu ( especially statics people ) happen to ask about it . 
  thing with diesel is that while the large vehicles such as trucks and buses are very clean the passenger cars are not . 
  that 's because the technology to `` wash '' the exhaust gases takes engine room space that smaller passengers simply do n't have . 
  finnish has several though my favorite from the 50 's is ` atomimiilu ' which is a compound word from atom and a reactor as a reactor in ye olde days of 1800 's was the place where you melted the iron by stacking coal in to it and all that which in old finnish is ` miilu ' so in theory ` an atom reactor ' but not quite and current word in use is ` ydinreaktori ' ( nucleus reactor ) . 
  or it 's related to finnish tois - which means next to something or second ( from toinen ) though today 's meaning is usually as diminutive , such as toissijainen ` nonessential ' or toissap\u00e4iv\u00e4inen ( yesturday ) . 
  and old one 's : sininen seteli = the blue bill = 1000mk from it 's blue colour also [ chydenius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_chydenius ) for his face on the 1000mk bill . 
  sibelius = for his face on 100mk bill, 
  you mean aside from being a finnish company ? 
  it 's like all the hamburger joints in the world , they all sell pretty much the same stuff where ever you go around the world - with minor local variations ofc . 
  depends , i 'd never buy mine without a fried egg , sausage , garlic sauce , lettuce and other stuff but the contents change between each grill though my favorite has always been beef with fried egg , salad and garlic . 
  obviously the traditional [ lihapiirakka ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1199,h_674,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/13-3-8011888.jpg ) though reportedly it 's fighting an up hill battle against the more classy `` burger joint x '' - burgers . 
  not in finland since you no longer fill your tax forms they come auto generated from the system and you just fill in if something seems amiss from the report . 
  might add than any company of any size that hires people on `` regular basis '' has to report in `` employer database '' about everyone working for them . 
  and no surprise that the longest sentences in finland are from tax evation . 
  if only try finland where it 's a % from your yearly income and they can fact check it from tax authorities so lying will do you no good . 
  as it is i just payed 150 $ for speeding 70km on the camera at from 80 to 60km zone . 
  hell even a parking ticket is 50 $ these days . 
  aside from garlic that some times literally ** charges ** at you if you try sriracha with wrong stuff . 
  country on origin has to be labeled in ** every single item ** from cars to tropical fruits by eu law and marked with ce otherwise you 're dealing with illegal goods . 
  there are exceptions however such as made in eu or eta which are there only to please the big corporations that know that the sales would drop like lead if the people would actually know where their stuff is actually coming from . 
  which coincidentally really irks when finnish names in sports are being spelled ie . 
  m\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4 as maeaettae which is obviously complete gibberish to any finn reading or spelling a name like that . 
  as often as i can afford , mostly herring , salmon and non-commercial fish species . 
  tell me about it summers here in west-coast of finland has 97 % humidity during summers and temperatures can climb up to 45c . 
  currently 0c and 96 % . 
  so do many other estonians since for some weird reason estonians often speak excellent finnish and there are very few fellow estonians around , so it 's not unusual for them to hang around with us finns to kill a fellow russian or a few . 
  we have `` a gradeless secondary school '' which is general education with focus on arts , environment stuff , sports etc. 
  depending on school and then you have trade schools which as per name teach you a trade of your choosing . 
  main difference is that only 2ndry school gives you eligibility to take part in the matriculation exam which actually matters more when applying to next tier then your actual final report from the school . 
  if you 're feeling particularly frisky and academic you can also do both schools at the same time along with the matriculation exam . 
  both grant you access to 3rd tier education ie . 
  university or polytechnic . 
  notice that due to 2ndary school being general as it is it gives you no work life or trade skills what so ever meaning that you either continue to university/polytechnic or trade school if you feel that you 've had enough of academics , unless you somehow manage to learn relevant trade and work life skills in some other way . 
  cheese or sausage on top ? 
  obviously cheese but some degenerates but sausage first , the freaks . 
  it depends entirely on whether the local customs dictated that only male heirs could inherit the title . 
  with the case of marriage women were generally considered to be married into an existing family and left their own completely while males where considered to do the opposite . 
  finland has universal health care that covers at least the following and has pay limit of 691 $ / year . 
  treatment of patients under 18 is always free of any charges . 
  http://stm.fi/en/client-fees in english or http://stm.fi/terveydenhuollon-maksut in finnish for more on what is charged and what is n't but in general you have to pay pennies for it and private insurance mainly means that you get to skip the line to see a specialist . 
  ( long term treatment such as cancer is maximum of 11,50 per treatment ans can be charged max of 45 times per calendar year ) in ` permanently institutionalized care ' ( dementia home for instance ) you are to be charged max of 85 % of your monthly income ( usually a pension ) or if the person being treated is the ` higher earner ' of the couple then that max is 42,5 % from their combined net income per month , however a person being treated must retain at least 107 $ per moth of income regardless of actual costs of treatment in the facility . 
  payment from me depends on my salary and is currently 0.82 and 1,22 % so roughly 2 % goes to paying up your ` insurance ' but in reality the tax is ` invisible ' to tax payer as it 's included in your total taxation percent . 
  we have ` ryssi\u00e4 ' that means to utterly fuck up with something which then forms the past tense ` ryssitty ' meaning something has been thoroughly fucked up . 
  word it self is a verb from a noun ` ryss\u00e4 ' which is a now derogatory term meaning russians . 
  original term is likely from watching russian human experiment from up close for 70 something years and the fact that if something was badly made or looked like it came from the 20 's ago it likely had cccp stamped on it . 
  also because of the average russian workers mentality or not giving a fuck about anything when it came to quality of workmanship , though nowadays the russians i 've seen have been professionals on their field . 
  i blame the communism for lack of commitment . 
  well , at least yours is consistently written in latin alphabet ... 
  though looking at the old phonemes and such , latin probably was n't exactly the best fit to write ( old ) germanic languages . 
  speaking of changes in language the oldest known text written in finnish is fairly readable as modern finnish ... 
  but the catch is that the words have shifted their meaning , not so much their morphology over time , the spelling is also problematic since it 's old finnic written in old cyrillic alphabet , so its pretty much guess work what is really written in that [ birch bark letter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birch_bark_letter_no._292 ) that was found in novgorod 1957 ... 
  though it 's from early 1300 's , so its relatively ` recent ' in comparison to brythonic or even older anglo-saxon texts . 
  i wonder ... did any brythonic text survive after the romans had left ? 
  i mean what i recall early celtic peoples of britain were n't terribly literally inclined people and mostly held oral traditions . 
  that it was mainly christian celtic monks that spread the notion of literacy with their monastic orders . 
  most europeans have triple the amount of holidays and need to work twice as less than an average american for the same pay , so we can also afford to have more visits outside europe . 
  canary islands , turkey & cyprus see tens of millions of european tourists every year and they 're located in african & asia . 
  nope , old old english is not indo-german any more than other celtic languages are . 
  you can thank those pesky saxons & angles that you are now indo-germanic . 
  crofters & farmers actually , which the swedes had driven out of sweden proper so they could claim the farms that forest finns had settled & founded two centuries earlier on v\u00e4rmland , norbotten , g\u00f6taland and finnskogen ( in norway side ) it also gave the swedish crown a nice excuse to fill up their new colonies ... at it 's height about 2/3 of `` swedish '' in new sweden were in fact finnish by ethnicity . 
  nuh uhh , you 're thinking middle-english there , old english is a celtic language and as ` easy ' to learn as welsh which is probably its closest living relative . 
  i eat at the time set up by my employer , worker union and finnish state in their mutually bonding agreement of current wage & working conditions contract for that particular labour sector . 
  generally this is set to be from 1/2h to 45min in length and starting at 11:00 and ending at 12:30 latest . 
  if you 're self-employed you eat when ever the hell you like . 
  what i do n't like and like about this sub is that for what ever reason i have n't had a down vote arrow for months for no apparent reason and it should be set so for everyone in reddit !, 
  it makes sense in context that a human being regardless of their sexual orientation or fetishes always has an urge to fill those needs one way or another . 
  problem of c. with topics such as cp is that just by existing it 's illegal ( and quite hideous i might add ) and anything illegal always has their market and sadly cp is no exception . 
  same in finland as well where asheds are either to be buried on the cemetary or to be ~ ~ dropped ~ ~ spread on a specific place at sea designated as a burial site . 
  storing the ashes in your house ` american style ' nets you jail time for `` violating the remains '' . 
  dunno about the worst but anything with uuno turhapuro aside from the one where [ he goes to army ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088336/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) are pretty universally bad imo . 
  though the worst recent offender has to be [ this one ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2343475/ ) characters are based on a finnish soap that has been going for 20 odd years by now and the little girls ( then 9 and 10 ) who * demanded * me to take them to see this film ( it was k12 ) thought that it was `` pretty bad '' and `` maybe the actors were just tired when making the film '' . 
  best part is that there 's even a sequel that i thankfully did n't had to watch . 
  oh and btw horror film that 's k12 cast with actors from a soap , what could go wrong ? 
  not [ this one deer by the spring ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/spoonflower/public/design_thumbnails/0405/0075/rrrpeurat_gobeliini_isompi_reunus_preview.png ) that has been on gobelins for ages but i ca n't find any sources to original painting .
