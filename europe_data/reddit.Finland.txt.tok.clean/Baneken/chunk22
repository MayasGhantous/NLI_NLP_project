  yes you actually do because you let them got wild and you also used to have domestic ones as well along with horses and even cheetah that for some unexplained reasons died out some 10,000 years a go or more . 
  metric is used because it can be scaled immediately from any point unlike that ridiculous imperialistic system .

   lay judges used to be recruited from members of parties . 
  finland still uses that system when selecting ` lautamies ' ( n\u00e4mndeman ) though they 're required to abolish any party affiliations when performing their duties . 
  i would definitely prefer the danish system though . 
  something something latin blood . 
  i do n't think that 's water there in the mattress ...

  a hint ; an old finnish saying `` rust rapes and frost fucks you over '' and we have frost 6 months a year or it rains or both . 
  also eu has limits on what you can stuff inside your vehicle without it requiring a semi truck-license ( 3t combined weight usually where a van weights about 2200-2500kg ) also your shit stays safe inside a van from elements and unscrupulous passers by . 
  also a van is not a recreational vehicle it costs you from 40000 $ and up so you better have some real use for it . 
  ohh fresh meat for the grinder , get 'em boys !, 
  also rye bread with nutella or jam . 
  i might throw up with just the thought of that taste combination . 
  americans use nutella etc. 
  because they fit with that mushy sugary gooey excuse of bread that they like so much over there in the south . 
  also being on time means you start your work on the clock not when you clock your self in the morning and then waste valuable work time changing to work clothes . 
  and if you 're particularly fastidious you ` warm up ' your machine so it 's ready to go when you have changed up thus saving some more of your employers valuable money .

  well the difference between [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leberk%c3%a4se#/media/file:leberk%c3%a4se-1.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qxpkjibu9q4/ul375v8yb6i/aaaaaaaabxw/jrwoblbjspm/s1600/img_0401.jpg ) is quite minimal . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marmite  as unilever has the exclusive right to the marmite name in the united kingdom , and sanitarium has the exclusive right to the name in australia and new zealand , their respective versions of marmite must be sold under a different name in the other countries . 
  unilever international sells the british marmite as our mate in australia and new zealand , while sanitarium sells the new zealand marmite as `` nz-mite '' in the uk . 
   vegemite ( / \u02c8v\u025bd\u0292\u1d7bma\u026at / vej-\u0259-myt ) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] is a thick , black australian food spread made from leftover brewers ' yeast extract with various vegetable and spice additives . 
  it was developed by cyril percy callister in melbourne , victoria in 1922 . 
  the vegemite brand is currently owned by mondelez international , [ 4 ] but will be acquired by the australian bega cheese group following an agreement in january 2017 . 
  [ 5 ]  in 1919 , following the disruption of british marmite imports after world war i and prior to the introduction of vegemite , callister 's employer , the australian company fred walker & co. , gave him the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by breweries . 
  callister had been hired by the chairman fred walker . 
  [ 6 ] vegemite was registered as a trademark in australia that same year . 
  callister used autolysis to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the carlton & united brewery . 
  concentrating the clear liquid extract and blending with salt , celery and onion extracts [ 7 ] formed a sticky black paste . 
  so they are as near a same product as they can be with slight differences . 
  marmite ? 
  it 's a salty spread made from a left over bakery yeast , tea , irnbru cans or at least i bring those home with me when i visit england for work . 
  yesterday we had a russian general boasting about walking through finnish lapland to sweden in just two days . 
  i have a vague feeling like someone famous might have made the same statement in -39 and it did n't exactly go as planned . 
  likely because only place to get octopus here in the north is from a can and those are ... well quite rubbery in both taste and structure . 
  no the real answer is because cheese is expensive as hell in the nordics so if you slice it thin you can eat it longer . 
  it 's a technical job but unlike in it you ca n't bunker your self in an office and just code away since you have to be on the field with the machines in question and that means you have to be able to understand at least some german especially if your job also entails on teaching the workers in how to use it . 
  i was flat out told by a german interviewer in email that not speaking any german ( even if the employer in question offers language courses as part of the training package ) is a huge nope . 
  well germany has an abundance of technical jobs atm . 
  in eures so learning german would benefit a technical career quite considerably . 
  in finnish a hammock is actually `` riippumatto '' which literally means `` hanging mat '' . 
  no because it 's black and glistening and looks like burned to crisp . 
  served traditionally in finland on every single thursday in any governmental institution such as the army or schools . 
  only games i 've played with finnish translation have been sim city 4 and cities skylines the rest either do n't have translation or mainly show a remarkable effort in butchering the language without even bothering to spell check even the simplest of nouns . 
  i still think fondly of my streets filled with `` pertsan rasvaburgeri '' in sim city 4 . :') exceptions are of c. games such as my summer car which is so quintessentially finnish that it 's painful to watch . 
  well , once those poles have been inserted the wall often is supported solely by them and sometimes when the end wall is very high such as in log church , vertical poles are inserted to stabilize the gable but its not a ` true ' stave building because those staves do n't help support the roof . 
  they function more like the flying arches of stone cathedrals . 
  that 's not a stave building , it has been supported later with staves when the log wall has started to crumble from rot . 
  stave houses are unique to scandinavia as far as i know . 
  the thing with houses in skyrim is that they have nordic-style stave framing and decorations but middle-english fireplace and chimney system and central european lathe & clay mortar walls . 
  so yeah , kind a pseudo-nordic when you start analyzing it . 
  i 'm not going to go into stone castles and such since those are pretty much pure fantasy . 
  are you telling me that the most common romanian name is n't vlad ? 
  i 'm shocked , * shocked * i tell you . 
  weird when a norwegian complains about stave houses which is the only native architectural style in scandinavia . 
  though admittedly the attic venting chimney-system is closer to medieval britain . 
  today what 's left of those houses are the churches . 
  and i 'm lucky in a way ... my granddad whose the aforementioned ` satchel master 's ' brother almost died in that same battle . 
  he was wounded thrice , first from bullets and then from an artillery shell and would have died on the field if his friends had n't literally dragged his unconscious body those three miles by the heels to medical tent . 
  yeah , tough people in that generation ... my grand uncle destroyed 4 tanks with satchel charges in one battle at spring of -44 and i 've heard that a record which someone else did was 12 . 
  4 or 12 tanks might not sound that much until you realize what a satchel charge is ... 
  it 's a 6kg block of tnt which you lit and throw under the advancing enemy tank . 
  well for starters you might want to try [ eures ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/eures/public/en/homepage ) and follow the links to about 20 different never-heard-of-what-the-heck-is-this . project pages of different eu organizations related to job seeking that never ever disclose or heaven forbid advertise that they even exist because somebody might actually use them . 
  my pet peeve about various eu projects is that they never ` advertise ' their existence to common people . 
  ` kuumaa ' which alternatively means either ` hot stuff ' or ` moon-earth ', 
  while he took part in winter war as well , this one happened in the continuation war . 
  yep , it gets kind of boring when we have plenty of other `` crazy '' guys to pick from . 
  people like viljam pylk\u00e4s for example who killed around 80 soviet soldiers with a submachine gun in one attack just by his own - if we do n't include his friend who kept filling mags so he could keep on shooting . 
  pylk\u00e4s could have killed even more but his sub-machine gun 's muzzle overheated and he was forced to change the barrel which allowed the remaining soviet battalion to escape . 
  h\u00e4yh\u00e4 circle jerk is the one meme i wish i would n't have to witness every single time winter war or snipers are mentioned . 
  indeed , much better for the surrounding neighbor realms to exact tribute in to their rulers personal coffers than losing thousands of soldiers for practically nothing . 
  hotels and hostels in finland go for about 50-150 $ per day and food something around 80 $ per candle light diner , groceries go for around 60-80 $ / a week depending what and how many you need to feed . 
  macedonia the one that looks like a rippoff from imperial japan 's flag ?
