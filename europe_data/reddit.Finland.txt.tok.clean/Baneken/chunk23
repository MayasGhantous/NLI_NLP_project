  in finnish kuusi has three meanings kuusi - spruce kuusi - your moon kuusi - number six, 
  what else can you expect from people who spell livorno as leghorn ... 
  exactly !, 
  might be a tad harder to bribe off western admirals then ukrainians to do nothing while you annex the said peninsula though . 
  of c. bigger issue for ukraine was that they knew that russia knew that had they done anything the russians would had thrown away all pretense and just simply launched a full scale invasion `` because they shot first and unprovoked '' . 
  easy if you know it spelled that way and not green-witch like most foreigners would assume . 
  greenwich since the name is based on ancient spelling of a letter combination that was abolished from the english alphabet sometime in the early 1900 's . 
  eu does not have a sales tax and in fact it was abolished in finland -94 ( in preparations of joining eu ) and replaced by vat . 
  finland is a very easy country to set up a business but median costs such as housing , living and wages are very high compared to say spain . 
  then again finland is one of the safest least corrupt countries in the world so there 's that . 
  finland has [ these ] ( http://arcticsnowhotel.fi/northern-lights-glass-igloos-rovaniemi-lapland-finland/ ) for sky watching , though . 
  because the ` stove ' in sauna and savupirtti were identical in function . 
  it was just heated more in sauna . 
  in finnish its oikeusasiamies a direct translation of ombudsman . 
  [ kikoskia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/kikoskia/featured ) for let 's play channel of classic games with famously british ( dry ) humor , absolutely no swearing ( unless oh crud and oh bugger counts ) and occasional voice acting peppered with silly commentary in between and everyone is always going to be absolutely horribly , horribly killed except when they are n't . 
  that there would be a queue and a flash mob for free buckets . 
  : s only in finland you advertise for free plastic buckets for store opening and end up with a flash mob demanding the said buckets and then causing a near riot in a rush for the said buckets . 
  and not even any special buckets just the plain old plastic 1 $ 10l buckets . 
  to clarify ` near riot ' in finland means a queue that is not formed in a proper line ( from front door to outside and round the building ) but a zig sag with people trying to get a head of their proper places in a queue . 
  time of writing which was 4:56 in german and 6:56 in finland . 
   and to answer the question i was sleeping as i usually do on saturday mornings . 
  might get your poor to put their kids in school as well . 
  it 's why it was originally implemented in finland , to get the parents send their kids to school for a daily free meal instead of working at the field or workshops with their parents . 
  https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/leivisk%c3%a4_ ( mittayksikk % c3 % b6 ) 1 leivisk\u00e4 = 20 naulaa ( nails ) = 8,5 kilograms . 
  16 ` leivisk\u00e4\u00e4 ' is a tynnyri lit . 
  a barrel . 
  it was changed in 1886 when finland adopted the metric system and became 10kg and fell out of use by the 1960 's along with it was introduced ` senttaali ' from the latin word cental meaning hundred . 
  ` leivisk\u00e4 ' and ` senttaali ' ( lit . 
  something like a breads weight ) were measurements that we still had to learn in school in the -80 's and do note that american cental still in use is 45,3592 kg, 
  also according to legend they caught a german spy in scotland during ww2 ( with a perfect accent and all ) because he could n't make heads or tails from the british monetary system when buying railway tickets to london . 
  or koorem is a very old loan since in finnish ` kantama ' means distance but is from a verb ` kantaa ' to carry then we of c. have ` kantamus ' a heavy load etc. 
  all derived from the same root which ironically is ` kanta ' a heel , base , beginning etc. 
  you forgot beech , 
  more like to be hired for permanent teaching position you need a degree in pedagogy . 
  for semester hirelings and the like rules are much much less strict . 
  that language has a gender for for words like who the hell makes those rules ? 
  why would `` a car '' be more female then `` a flower '' what if `` a man '' is a feminine word ? 
  then entire concept just feels so utterly alien from a finnish standpoint where we have no genders just one word for both sexes and consequently phrases where you could go on for pages of speaking about `` h\u00e4n '' but you do n't really know if were talking about male or female unless specifically said to be either man or a woman or having a `` male or female only '' name , though this is an issue only when translating texts from foreign sources ( mainly english ) . 
  it 's because the french spelling does n't indicate hidden letters while still keeping them in pronunciation . 
  none there would n't had even been vote if cameron and his pary would had had the balls to say no under pressure and take the political plunge that would had followed anyway . 
  [ pasila ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scurtr4xp94 ) an excerpt from the show with a character singing and commenting a song in episode that mocks `` finnish tango '' - music for it 's melancholy ( ohh , this winters frost that kills even the garden gnomes ... the title is `` angel burned to crisp '' ) . 
  here 's [ another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k_lijldip4 ) `` throw me in to the wall you handsome wild bull '', 
  two weeks , two weeks , it 's been two weeks * cry * :'(, 
  title says ** since 2000 ** and youtube ** started 2006 ** therefore youtube does not count here since it was ** not around in 2000 ** . 
  you tube was n't around until as late as 2006 so it does n't count here . 
  the phoenix song `` rising like a phoenix lah lah laaaahhhhh '' . 
  really , most of the festo products i 've have been in italian machines with italian text never german . 
  only thing definitely italian i can name right away from the non usual ones mentioned already is festo ( a big name in pneumatics ) . 
  that image is wrong finnish cats say ` miau ' not ` nau ' utterly different spelling for those two and only an inbred swede could think of those two being anywhere equal in spelling . 
  not for drinking at least if you need water use the tap . 
  they freeze solid obviously and then the pipes burst and water prays everywhere come spring that sort of thing unless you put a heating on the fountain which also costs money and in which case you might as well forget it . 
  just a word , one word , ** winter **, 
  in beer league or something but like 99 % of the southerners they play football and contend on getting raped in hockey . 
  nope , have fun with your next tzar putins and medjedev the yes men . 
  well it is a messerschmitt after all ... 
  how ever sweden fights to the last finn so it might take a while . 
  well the nazis actually tried several more slower versions but nothing really met the quota they had set and then there was that soldiers really were n't that much into shooting civilians all day long . 
  so they finally invented the gas chambers and the quotas were met and they got basically efficient by experimentation because for obvious reasons there was no manual what they did . 
  ironically i 've never seen that one before in my life . 
  it 's a pretty common `` cheap restaurant '' sauce sitting quietly in the table rack with bottles of tabasco , salt and pepper .

  makkaraperunat is also sometimes offered with an egg though a beatroot slice would definetly add a bit of flavor to dish . 
  some [ old pictures ] ( https://1drv.ms/a/s!avueuqkb2mzcgaf57dwvn3gpe7iciw ) of my garden from spring and summer, 
  in finland bees are equal to any other domestic or farm animals . 
  checked the label of hershey at the `` american aisle '' in the local market and well guess what it was n't even called chocolate in eu label that was glued to it ( as it had no cocoa at all just flavors and that terrible corn syrup that americans so love ) . 
  japan ? 
  i learned english by playing maniac mansion and zak mckraken along with leisure suit larry and they say that games ca n't be educational , well and having your dad to buy you a 1000 page english - finnish - english dictionary just because you seem to have interest on learning english at a young age . 
  this obviously happened in the 80 's in an age when internet was nothing but a cyber punk dream and a wet spot in gibson 's pants . 
  got to love the america police on the language they are trained to use ... trimino hollered : `` get on the ground or you 're fucking dead . '' he fired five times , hitting hall twice . 
  and he even missed three bullets from point blank . 
  american cops really are in need of some serious training . 
  yes i 'm sure or they send a dog but either way any use of gun is always investigated as is waving it around for any reason . 
  here 's [ the menu ] ( http://www.porinmestaripizzat.fi/lista.html ) from the best pizzeria in my home town . 
  i 'm not going to translate that so either find another finn for that or use google translate . 
  oh and prices are standard prices for finland . 
  it 's quick fix to keep census records , scandinavian countries have had centralized citizenship census with addresses for hundreds of years now which until 19th century where held by the churches and it was ( and still is ) against the law to not have a valid postal address though poste restante is now allowed . 
  this also means that having address in driving license is meaningless since the police knows where you live when they check the card , mainly because everyone is in the records from the day they are born . 
  also means that there is no need for us style ridiculous vote hunting on elections since every single citizen is in the electronic census list already as is our taxation i for instance get my taxes all automatically counted in and i just need to check if i need to do corrections since the employer sends everything automatically to the taxman . 
  he would had likely been tazed and failing that shot on the leg which in anywhere but us generally makes the suspect go down it seems . 
  putin waving his ~ ~ dick ~ ~ heavy nuclear capable bombers with no transponders on might have something to do with that . 
  *** toasted *** rye bread with cheese you heathen . 
  :p and that is proper rye bread not that mushy germanish that you in the south with no teeth eat . 
  no kidding on work site that i worked there was a pile of stuff blocking the corridor so you had to go long long way around to reach the other side or squeeze between the gyproc piles and the wall . 
  so from around the corner comes this older polish guy with paint buckets and stuff , looks at the pile and says just one word `` kurwa '' in the most flat out emotionless intonation you can imagine and turns and goes back around the corner . 
  for some reason that utter lack of emotion in the situation just cracked me up . 
  no they are n't prepositions are on , off , at , in , to , et c. ie . 
  `` going to the house '' has a preposition but going `` around the house '' does not . 
  `` ilman '' or `` ymp\u00e4ri '' are adverbs or `` defining verbs '' that are used to define a verb in a sentence . 
  you mean it 's not svejk ? 
  well for comparison minnesota has the equal amount of people as finland but makes 80\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ as gdp more then finland per year . 
  question is what happens to that money where does it go because the last time i checked minnesota or well any other state in us is far far from socialist utopia that for example finland is ( or well relatively social utopia anyway ) even if they might as well be and still afford to pay extra 80bil to federal programs/national guard or what have you . 
  also j\u00fcrgen i ca n't imagine a more german name then that . 
  sadly does n't work here in finland where the customs have fought against eu for not taxing that extra 40 000 $ ( as taxes ) with tenacity like it 's against the red horde in ww2 . 
  best battle in this war was when the head of customs ranted in new papers that he had more authority over the issue then the supreme court of finland that had decided that the customs had to give the money back for the claimant . 
  i mainly meet poles at work . 
  - jebany is new to me ... 
  in finland their swearing seems to have truncated to mostly kurwa-ciema axle . 
  the big thing to differentiate sabme with finnish and estonian is the wide usage of g-sound which is almost nonexistent in finnish and estonian . 
  you did n't walk on top of the packages to read swedish did you ? 
  ;p alternatively they literally spoke and taught swedish to you .
