  fun fact : to finns estonians speak at mile a minute pace ... 
  then you should n't have started that lucrative pirate clock business back in the late 1800 's if you did n't want to be associated with them . 
  towel holders in public restrooms ? 
  you know the ones that have a cloth roll inside a box . 
   too many people think hitler was german . 
  probably the best pr move of all time . 
  18 in finland and the righteous fury of alcohol administration will fall upon you if there 's even whiff of selling alcohol to underaged . 
  you will also be sent to hell for destroying those poor youngsters for giving them the deadly sin of alcohol you evil disgusting owner of alcohol establishment and also voe be on your staff for allowing such a thing to happen and i 'm not even fucking kidding . 
  english has kith and kin which mean same things as in finnish but both words are archaic if not ancient . 
  i stop running when there 's snow on the ground because then i start skiing up to -25 c and stop in warmer temps if there 's significant wind . 
  i start my days with rye bread , oatmeal porridge with butter and milk and coffee with milk and no sugar . 
  unless you 're a `` sent worker '' and have your lunches in a company cafe like i did and we had those every morning and well i thought ... umm ... so you brits do n't eat like that every morning ? 
  in finland there are essentially two secondary schools ; vocational and gradeless secondary school where former has for the first year as `` general education '' with math , sports etc. 
  and the following 2 years of strictly vocational studies and `` at work practice '' of your chosen vocational field . 
  gradeless secondary has no classes by age meaning you have a certain amount of courses that everyone has to take and free courses of certain amount but you can take as many courses as you like after as extra . 
  gradeless can be combi ed with the vocational tract but few opt to it as it requires huge amount of work with the matriculation exam and `` end project '' from vocational also it means 3/4 amounts of more courses then normal . 
  personally i picked gradeless , this is what i had on my report card from 16 years ago : subject and amount of courses during 3 years of study * finnish 7 * a1 english 8 * a2 swedish 7 * math short 6 * math long ( advanced ) 3 * biology 5 * geography 4 * physics 5 * chemistry 4 * religion 3 * philosophy 2 * history 6 * music 1 * arts 7 ( my school was art focused school ) * sports 2 * health education 1 * study counseling 1 * computers 2 * `` art today '' 1 fuck me if i remember what this was about ... * astronomy 1 mandatory 47 ( same as in vocational tract actually ) extra subjects 25 specials 4 total 76 edit : both tracks give you eligibility to apply for university .

  heh , i just go with ` kippis ' , ` h\u00f6lkyn k\u00f6lkyn ' or ` pohjanmaan kautta ' depending on context and occasion . 
  you 've never had root parsley ? 
  paska school always cracks me up . 
  [ karhu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karhu ) is probably the most popular lager-type beer in finland . 
  best is a bit subjective , my favourite is [ mufloni ] which was cohosen as best pilsner in finland 2016 ( https://olutverkko.wordpress.com/2016/08/17/mufloni-pilsner-suomen-paras-olut-2016-kisan-voittajaksi/ ) but since both are from my hometown , i 'm a bit biased i guess . 
  in general all lemonades , fantas , 7ups et c. are called collectively as ` virvoitusjuoma ' or ` l\u00e4ske dryck ' or ` refreshing drink ' since we finns are boring that way . 
  since no one has mentioned this yet : the local k-chain had a coffee brand which they adertised as `` p\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4si k-kahvilla '' which means literally `` end your days with k-coffee '' and they meant it as `` end your * day * '' also there was the infamous `` margarin scandal '' in the 60s where according to rumours margarin was made from dead cats among other things . 
  at least one margarin factory vent to bankcrupt because of that . 
  `` ennen pantiin mirrit multaan , nyt ne pannaan suvikultaan '' was the common adage ( before the cats were put to soil now they are put to oil for suvikulta ) and old people still refer to margarin as katti rasva or cat grease and refuse to eat it . 
  and they fired publicly some of their management to get rid the dreaded moniker `` natsi-siwa '' or `` nazi-grocery store '' which was how people considered their work practices of spying and checking all the bags of their employees by their supervisors at the end of the day . 
  suspecting your cashiers as thieves by default may work in germany but certainly not in finland . 
  hei i 'm finnish i 've never ever heard of any other use for ` spunk ' then semen or rather cum . 
  no you need 100m to stop if the other car is full stop if both of you start to decelerate at approximately the same time you can do it with centimeters between you which is of c. simple physics of two moving objects . 
  the key is noticing when the car ahead of you is stopping which is n't a 100m by a long shot unless it 's night time and generally not even then and as `` little '' as 40km/h between the two of you makes the car in front seem like hes not moving at all ( which is why very slow vehicles have that huge ass fluorescent red triangle ) . 
  we have http://www.molok.fi/main.php in cities if you drive to landfill your self you 'd have to pay for it your self so no . 
  us is awesome when you 're young , well educated , healthy and most of all single anything else and it sucks balls to live in us . 
  salary in the us might be big but when it costs you 3000 $ / month * per kid * for kindergarten suddenly finland with half the salary but ( comparatively ) free childcare , free healthcare , proper social security and free university education for the kids suddenly sounds like an awesome deal and payed summer vacation for everyone btw . 
  with other family benefits . 
  since when has belarus been anything but russian frontier ? 
  the same way americans handled moving from pounds to dollars . 
  most finnish must be [ these ] ( https://www.google.fi/imgres?imgurl=http://www.kotikokki.net/media/cache/large/recipeimage/large/52d6e261d074a9ec0e0d139a/original.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.kotikokki.net/reseptit/nayta/19676/karjalanpiirakka/&amp;h=300&amp;w=400&amp;tbnid=qygivraqmlquum:&amp;tbnh=150&amp;tbnw=200&amp;docid=6dquvxc3t3xcym&amp;itg=1&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;usg=__z8ypa1yaxp5vfn3sqmlv8iup1nq= ) though we have those same buns that swedes boast as well . 
  that 's the official definition but most agree that europe ends after poland even if russia would like to object . 
  only bad city we have is helsinki where all those filthy foreigners gather with their foreign ideas and foreign languages and behave like filthy foreigners not like us proper finns . 
  finland in that you can not walk on planted fields/crops/et c. or enter near private residence , make fire , chop wood etc. 
  otherwise you 're free to roam on anyone 's land aside from military or government installations ( which goes without saying ) . 
  ( 4.11.2011 / 1112 ) 1 chapter 1 \u00a7 order of government finland is a sovereign state order of the finnish government is confirmed in this act of constitution which ensures that human rights , freedom of expression and rights and duties of an individual are secured and upholds equality in society . 
  finland shall take part in international co-operation to secure peace and human rights and to develop the society . 
  finland is a member of eu . 
  ( 4.11.2011 / 1112 ) i probably mangled the translation since i do n't know how to write legal jargon in english but you get the point . 
  that was a light stab in that you likely meant cra ** p ** not ** b ** . 
  crab ? 
  is that a crustacean or an sd ? 
  well they come illegally from tunisia therefore they 'll be returned to tunisia according to international laws . 
  they can vouch for asylum there . 
  haul every `` refugee '' boat i find floating in the mediterranean back to libya & tunisia instead of giving free rides to ` lands of milk & honey ' like now . 
  do it a few months straight and they stop trying . 
  depends on what you buy and where you take it . 
  ^ like ^ booze ^ across ^ the ^ sea ;p, 
  finno-ugric language group . 
  it 's not like i understood the thick accent at the snack stand at aylesbury either and all my life i had been taught that english people speak english !!!, 
  all i could figure out was mumble mumble `` hi luv '' mumble mumble jumble jumble `` cheers mate ! '', 
  ( and stole all of my change in one go :o :( : ? ), 
  and something like a word `` next ! '', 
  while handing me some fries with something that may had been once a fish . 
  in finland nope unless you have a birth defect ie . 
  mentally retarded who have their own schools and drastically slower ( and also individual ) curriculum then normal schools . 
  normal schools do n't separate by abilities so you have the ` good ' and ` bad ' learners all together with the good learners getting `` teacher pet '' on their foreheads and extra homework for their troubles and the bad learners getting a special education teaching ( usually for dyslexia which has gained a ** lot ** more attention for the past 15 years or so then it used to ) . 
  old and soggy socks comes close i think . 
  anything except buttered rutabaga that sour buttery taste is really an acquired taste . 
  how else are you going to get fatty bird liver except from a bird via feeding to it something fatty ? 
  you ca n't even enter any establishment that serves alcohol on your own if you 're under 18 and supplying alcohol to minors to drink is a crime . 
  in other words legally you should n't get anything with alcohol from anywhere when you 're under 18 but we all know how well that works , you 're allowed to have some alcohol with your parents . 
  it 's the law in all nordics and if you violate it as bar owner you never again sell booze to anyone unless you asskiss your self back to booze inspectors good grace . 
  edit : oh yeah koskenkorva & coke was my first mistress and i was 14 . 
  in finland it depends on municipality but generally 50 $ for the first visit and free after that or 0 but i know of no one who would be that poor . 
  dentist was about 120 $ total for surgery of removing 4 wisdom tooth and about 30 $ for cleaning but for non emergency procedures you 'd have to wait as long as 6months or go to private practice which costs slightly more then public side . 
  you better hurry then if you plan on coming to finland http://www.studyinfinland.fi/tuitionfees  tuition fees  do i need to pay tuition fees in finland ? 
   currently , no tuition fees are charged in regular degree programmes - regardless of your nationality  tuition fees for non-eu/eea students will however be introduced from autumn 2017 onwards  you must independently cover your living expenses - think carefully about how you will finance your studies in finland, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/municipalities_of_finland  the municipalities ( finnish : kunta ; swedish : kommun ) represent the local level of administration in finland and act as the fundamental , self-governing administrative units of the country . 
  the entire country is incorporated into municipalities and legally , all municipalities are equal , although certain municipalities are called cities or towns ( finnish : kaupunki ; swedish : stad ) . 
  municipalities have the right to levy a flat percentual income tax , which is between 16 and 22 percent , and they provide two thirds of public services . 
  municipalities control many community services , such as schools , health care and the water supply , and local streets . 
  ** they do not maintain highways , set laws or keep police forces -- these tasks are the responsibility of the central government . 
  invoice for a van ( citroen relay/jumper ) that i bought about a month a go : value added tax 0 % = 25 145 $ value added tax 24 % = 31 180 $ extras vat 24 % = 4640 $ estimated car tax = 4843,90 $ `` manufacturers equipment package '' vat 24 % 3208 $ delivery cost vat 24 % 600 $ total cost with car tax vat 0 % 35864,44 $ vat 24 % 44 471,90 $ old clunker van delivered 5000 $ in exchange ( special offer only today , buy now ! ), 
  total cost vat 24 % + car taxes and all 39 471,90 $ for more information see [ here ] ( http://www.trafi.fi/en/road ) car tax is determined by co-emissions which for this van are 195g/km since this van is a bran new i do n't need an mot for the next 3 years which saves me about 100 $ per year also since this baby runs on diesel i have to pay a yearly diesel payment and is cheaper then gasoline at the pump so it evens out . 
  diesel tax is 397 $ per year + 33,50 $ base tax so 430,50 $ / year vat is important because a business gets that vat returned where as a private citizen does not . 
  well that explains many things about driving skills in ` sveriges v\u00e4rsta bil f\u00f6raren ' i was wondering how on earth could they had ever passed the test in the first place . 
  do n't you have anything to do but going to strike in france ? 
  / s each time i hear news from france it 's this or that is going on strike . 
  also pano-automaatti for storing the cash in which is very handy for avoiding the queue inside and it also counts and takes in coins as well . 
  banks in finland what what ever reason refuse to take coins especially in exchange which is rather annoying . 
  this those other finns live in some bad place with only kebab and pizza places around true finns eat [ these ] ( http://www.hs.fi/webkuva/taysi/560/1363496964930?ts=1091 ) when drunk . 
  stuffing is what ever you happen to order inside i prefer eggs ( cooked properly from both sides not one side only like crazy britons ) and sausages some like kebab meat and that weird green stuff that used to be plants . 
  i would say send all refugees to swalbard , that 'll teach 'em to come to europe . 
  speaking of specialty beers glutein free finnish [ `` kukko '' ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/5828798/landscape16_9/1024/576/17dad3fe6bef8cf651f4052d9eabc9cc/aq/laitilan-kukko-2.jpg ) has just arrived in texas last month . 
  although the company is not small it 's still very much a microbrewery by us standards which is 600 000 liter/year ( in finland tax limit is 30 000l/y ) . 
  artisanal beverage distributors is the distributor in texas . 
  beer it self tastes pretty much like any other lager/pils though it might have quite a bit more hops then your average american lager . 
  i have at least : * basic car insurance as demanded by law * no ( private ) health insurance since i wo n't need a one as it 's provided by the government ( kela ) and my work place by law * theft insurance for my tools in the van ( some 3000 $ in total i think ) and for the van of c. * home insurance * insurance for my summer cottage this in finland btw . 
  you ca n't it might show skin and then someone could get triggered and jump from the window . 
  better americans then russians but preferably neither . 
  also putting your hand on your temple with index forward and thumb up in finland means `` yes i fucked up , kill me ! '',
