  in true communist utopia you 'd need no money because you would get everything from the state or by bartering it directly with other people . 
  when you look at this `` end goal '' it 's no wonder why `` pure communism '' will never work in large scale . 
  it can work to some degree in small village sized communities where pretty much everyone is dependent on their one another for survival . 
  it would n't surprise me in the least if it came out that the coup was attempted because someone had leaked the ` list ' to army and some hotheads decided to `` act before it 's too late '' . 
  poland does n't have a winter . 
  only winter it has is at the tatra in the south where the ski resorts are . 
  no wonder when you sack over 50,000 government officials in one go . 
  you would think they must grow on trees to replace all of those who are sacked . 
  you seems to be going all the way down this time . 
  here 's another fine [ example ] ( http://poritieto.com/images/b/b2/ruosniemen_kirkko.jpg ) to the list of fugliest churches in finland . 
  honestly you ca n't make a church much more `` unchurch '' than that . 
  maybe they have the italian style permissions that can be issued after you have started building ? 
  well , better make it quick than drag it on and on like a bad joke . 
  wee , we have a new `` wicked witch of the west '' . 
  i wonder if she 's going to be as tough old ewe as thatcher was in her day . 
  it 's usually 210cm 's which does n't do much difference ... 
  always nice to know that there 's an artsy fartsy name for something that in finnish is simply `` oven baked ice cream '' and which we made in home economics class in school . 
  glass prison however is still a prison . 
  also as they have live off a set distance ( 2miles or so iirc ) from places where minors may frequent ( usually public parks ) some municipalities in florida use this as a tactic to drive them away or in that one interviewed case to live under a bridge or be forced leave the town , however since the law is state wide this often means leaving florida all together . 
  and tax frauds ... man those sentences are usually fucking draconian once the sentence is finally announced because nobody fucks with the tax office and gets away with it . 
  huh ? 
  they actually let that satanist nut-hole out already ? 
  i wonder at what grounds that guy was declared sane enough to bet let out . 
  then again `` monimurrrhaaja m\u00f6r\u00e4nen '' aka mika muranen and ilpo larha have also been released a couple of years a go , i recall . 
  5-2 is a lot of goals in that level of football . 
  i watched it live , iceland nearly scored during the last 2 minutes btw . 
  a pretty decent match actually , despite the numbers . 
  ** finland : ** cuban volleyball team really ****** it up and got 8 of them selves [ arrested under suspicions of aggravated rape . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/members_of_cubas_volleyball_team_detained_on_rape_suspicions/9000734 ) in finnish judicial system aggravated usually means that there 's a ) a lethal weapon involved b ) injuries to victim that threatened life c ) gang rape d ) sodomy in such a scale that it humiliated victim even more then the actual rape it self e ) a pedophilic crime discussion thread [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4r2i1j/finland_members_of_cubas_volleyball_team_detained/ ), 
  well diesel used to be like twice as cheaper than gasoline in the usa so they were even more thirsty and clunky than gasoline engines ... 
  i would n't buy an american made & designed car with a diesel engine if my life would depend on it . 
  indeed mpg is ** miles per gallon ** and other is ** liters per 100kilometer ** so 15mpg = ( 1,6 * 15km ) / 3,785 l = 24km / 3,785 l = 24km / 3,785 l = 6,3 km / l = 100km / 6,3 l = 15,8 l / 100km my citroen relay / jumper as it called has a mileage of 46miles per gallon so 5,14 l / 100km though my car computer tells me a 9-10l / 100km which i think is closer to actual usage figures then those by the manufacturer . 
  edit : uuhh math and units :p, 
  thats patently wrong then . 
  i have a 2 months old citroen relay-van with `` only 130hp '' straight 2l engine and it consumes around 8l/100km that gm gas guzzler slurps 10l minumum per 100km more likely 15l/100km assuming its anything like old chrysler saratoga with 3.0 l v6 was that i had at one point . 
  i have a feeling that eu has really dropped the ball on informing the general public what actually goes on in the eu and what it represents . 
  part of the reason is that if a bomber has to turn back it ca n't land if it has a full payload so dumping the bombs into uninhabited area or sea or anywhere that 's below you if you in enemy territory , was the safest bet to get the plane back in one pice . 
  does a retired president count ? 
  we have one to `` spare '' though his close to hundred years old now . 
  only good thing turning up from brexit to eu . 
  i whole hartedly agree on thsi sentiment either ** stay ** or ** gtfo ** but your days as a mother of all of free loaders in eu are over . 
  well pardon me for not speaking particularly good french and thus mistaking that muscadet is a type of wine instead of ` nutmeg ' . 
  unsurprisingly more than half of those sausages originate from germanic speaking areas . 
  the germans sure used to love sausages and brought them where ever they went or settled . 
  it 's probably in their dna or something to eat and promulgate the use of sausages . 
  i 'm surprised that there is n't a wine marinated sausage in the list , considering the amount of wine based dishes in france . 
  so , people with pensions voted no ... not a great surprise really . 
  yea , i doubt that gb would like that too much either but some kind of self-rule or semi-autonomy could work . 
  and ironically most of them are against `` refugees '' from pakistan and india but hey do n't let the facts cloud your judgment . 
  how ever it 's conveniently buried that the parliament is in no way compelled by the outcome of the actual vote , aside from occasional riots that might ensue . 
  the whole vote thing is/was a publicity stunt from the political animal cameron to save his own ass after impossible promises about eu in 2013 elections . 
  i was expecting `` red dawn '' and i got `` west wing '' and i was rather disappointed for obvious reasons . 
  in some parts it was believed that once you had found the magic fern aarnivalkea aka treasure fire would point the spot for hidden treasure . 
  in others it was the ghost of the former master of the homestead who would point the place for the treasure but only in midsummer night would he appear . 
  ( no magic fern needed ), 
  no it 's literally the middle of summer after which the nights start to get darker again and the days beging to shorten towards th winter . 
  do n't forget to get wild if they remembered to include `` two minutes to midnight '' in their play set , 
  sounds familiar ... you know , lithuanian and finnish folklore seems to share a lot when it comes to ukon juhla aka summer solstice aka st. john 's feast/day . 
  do you also hunt the magic treasure ghosts at solstice and run naked three times around the well in hopes of seeing your future husband 's image reflected on the water ? 
  you know what would happen if the agricultural subsidies were abolished ? 
  first of all we 'd have about 100 000 new unemployed and secondly your daily food bill would triple . 
  just kindly shut up already about the agri subs tuliniemi it 's getting really old & annoying to read since you obviously have n't even the slightest idea of european agriculture and it 's economical realities . 
  i 'm willing to bet you do n't even know ( without googling it ) why the system was implemented in the first place . 
  especially if it 's led by a german chairman who was n't born in germany ... 
  in helsinki we have `` mogadishu avenue '' because a lot of refugees from somalia settled there at -90 's once being granted asylum . 
  i ca n't recall them ever complaining about the nickname . 
  reminds me of this old sketch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh3rd0j4u1w about finns complaining to russia about air space violations during the cold war . 
  from 2:10 - look , we have a very serious matter to talk about - i see ... - your plane has violated our air space and we wo n't tolerate it - you wo n't tolerate ? 
  - no we wo n't - well in that case i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you a pointed question . 
  - a what question ? 
  - well even if you wo n't tolerate it then what ? 
  - well we 're very very angry that you violated our air space !, 
  - yes you are very angry but then what ? 
  - this incident will not happen again is that clear !!!, 
  - understood - then what ? 
  no , no , no and again no !!!, 
  ( fist shaking ) - your point has been made clear but i ask you again then what ? 
  - for crying out loud do n't you get it we get very very angry about it . 
  - sure you do !, 
  and obviously very much so . 
  - glad you noticed !, 
  - yes that 's very understandable most people get very upset when they 're angry . 
  - but you two are not answering the essential question !, 
  - the what ? 
  - ( rises up from the chair ) the question is what are you two going to ** actually do ** about it ? 
  since you two are so very very angry about the incident and all that and will not tolerate it , so i ask from you two again ** then what ** ? 
  - well ... ummm ... he asked `` then what ? 
  '' , you know ... - we 'll , yes , exactly as in ... the question is very valid . 
  - we 'll be that question as it may but boy did n't we say our objections straight to your face did n't we !!, 
  - absolutely - we were very angry and told you to never do that again did n't we ? 
  - exactly - take that swedes !, 
  we do n't cover for russians do n't we ? 
  - we dared to say straight on your face what we wanted did n't we ? 
  - absolutely - well that settles it then ( shakes hands ) - they believed us ? 
  oh , yes they did !, 
  we did good . 
  honestly , 24m/s is n't anything unusual in finland . 
  there 's been 36m/s winds recorded during major one like tapani a few years back . 
  however the time of the year is . 
  the storms usually coincide with the warming and cooling of atlantic at early spring and late fall about the time when the arctic sea begins freezing or melting .
