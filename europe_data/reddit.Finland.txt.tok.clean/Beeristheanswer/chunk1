nordics are like onions , we dress in layers . 
  25 and above is a heat wave here , meaning it 's exceptionally hot . 
  anything above 20 is when beaches are overcrowded . 
  25 + for longer periods of time and people start going insane . 
  insane like talking and having a laugh with strangers because it 's so ridiculously hot we ca n't think straight . 
  ohhhhhhhhhhh . 
  of course he did . 
  i 'm very confused by this comment thread ... 
  http://spraktidningen.se/artiklar/2013/08/rikssvenskans-fina-kusin * you * are the weird deviation !, 
  we speak the pure language , you peasant , 
  i ca n't stand the guy , but that was impressive , i 'll give him that !, 
  * euros - eurot * 5 euro/euros - 5 euroa * cents - sentit * 50 cent - in da club or 50 sentti\u00e4 * and - ja, 
  or jyuro , full swenglish-style , i 've noticed recently . 
  can it be a regional thing ? 
  [ in finland , the word * viina * is always used for finnish-made neutral spirit , including finnish vodka , and the russian word ( vodka ) is used only for vodkas from other countries . 
  in informal speech , viina can also refer to any similarly strong beverage similarly to booze , whether flavored or unflavored . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a4nnvin ) for us it sounds weird when people associate us with vodka . 
  that 's foreign stuff !, 
  capital city suggestion : romarienhamn, 
  i 'm pretty sure it makes him at least over 1 \u2030 bulgarian . 
  and in turku , pori is considered a strange , silly place . 
  tampere is referred to as `` abroad '' . 
  gyproc for drywall . 
  that 's fair , i guess i was still reacting to the pc police who completely missed the point of the event above . 
  white finns and immigrants who created this idea together , probably more white finns were voicing the positive feedback as there are far less immigrants . 
  are we not allowed feel that it 's nice to advance mutual understanding and coexistence with our immigrant population because we 're not on their level in the oppression olympics ? 
  are the immigrants who happily took part because of the same motive wrong as well ? 
  who are you to decide they should be offended ? 
  this was a positive , well-received thing , but you 're not pleased because you think people should find this offensive . 
  serious question , what exactly do you think is wrong or racist about this event ? 
  the same thing was or is being done in my city , people thought it 's a wonderful way of opening discussion as well as broadening understanding and tolerance of other peoples cultures , not hurr durr i wore a hijab and now i know what it 's like, 
  the article itself is actually titled `` barren sight in s : t petersburg store '' . 
  i think the keyword is * institutional racism * , not individual cases . 
  that has n't gone anywhere . 
  the 125 meur in eu subsidies will allow producers to pull their product or to not harvest their crop so that prices wo n't go down . 
  we call it [ rally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orvbki0m9zy ) [ english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kdjonwv2os ), 
  i 'd be happy if we even had 12 week * summers *, 
  [ found it !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/anarchism/comments/28f2u4/if_modern_anarchists_fought_in_spain_a_short/ ), 
  i think i 've seen it posted there before , general opinion was it was funny and somewhat true . 
  or what people think people do under the banner of that word . 
  actions seem to be irrelevant in this context , because obviously everyone who voted f !, 
  is a crazy feminazi . 
  clearly the word means something , to some people it gives this reaction . 
  they were offered 100 000 crowns , it does n't go far in a campaign , so they decided to burn the money instead and it got them a lot of publicity . 
  sure it was controversial and provocative . 
  you might have a hard time understanding that if you do n't believe in facts like the wage gap , though . 
  a knee-jerk reaction to the word feminism with zero knowledge about the party and their platform . 
   explain to me the relevance ofus segregation in this discussion . 
  i do n't suggest those things did n't happen or were n't deplorable , but what is it other than a shit , irrelevant point ? 
  it 's brainless . 
  op was questioning the point of bringing up a random historical human rights abuse for no apparent reason and randomly mentioned more things from different countries to show how pointless this is . 
  you got butthurt because not only european countries were arbitrarily mentioned ? 
  this whole post is brainless . 
  you 're the only one in this thread that got upset and defensive when someone dared mention questionable things countries have done in the past . 
  was it too hard of a burden on your nationalist pride ? 
  * spain * germany and the allies * britain * france * usa oh my god here we go again anti-american circlejerk, 
  to make the photos look more thuggish/intimidating , i guess ? 
  drunk wookies with potatoes in their mouths . 
  scarcely populated , vast space , bordering part of the enemy in this case . 
  what 's your point ? 
  * being dragged to unpopular imperialist wars * goodbye self-determination * worsening relationship with russia * increased perception of being part of western aggression in terrorist organisations . 
  * being the likely first choice battleground if russia and nato start fighting . 
  i 'm mostly worried this will help push along the joining of nato for my country . 
  goddamn wet shitty rain and the added darkness because of no snow reflecting the sparse light ... at least spring will come faster without all that melting snow , right ? 
  ( inb4 massive snowfall in february lasting until may ), 
  i see it as the opposite of being cold and self-centered . 
  cultural differences !, 
  on the contrary , i would go out of my mind if i was forced to have meaningless conversations with strangers about nothing . 
  ask a finn `` how are you '' and you will get an honest answer , not empty pleasantries . 
  never heard of this expression before , that 's so funny !, 
  i work with swedes a lot and this is exactly how it is most of the time . 
  swedes want to have a nice chit-chat and make sure everyone is feeling well before beginning , while us finns just want to get it done , * perkele * . 
  turku native myself , i remember isolated incidents from childhood but that 's it . 
  anyone silly enough to have something against us are n't really worth to think about imo . 
  where have you been denied service though ? 
  that 's really interesting, 
  hah , my german is n't exactly fluent . 
  how is it supposed to be written ? 
  thank you for liking it dirty though, 
  i 'm having a laugh , i do n't care either . 
  only difference is i just happen to have it as my first language . 
  i find it hilarious when someone 's offended by that for some reason , honestly i 'm not sure whether / u/werccu is joking as well or serious , because i 've seen some ridiculous shit before :d, 
  no , no we all are , i 'm talking about all you language-handicapped finns !, 
  we ca n't all be born with silver spoons up our asses, 
  this is directed towards the swedish speaking minority of finns .

  i 'm so down for scotland joining best europe, 
  yeah , we 're also the only ones who think swedes have a tendency to talk too much, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jmfnokjudm ) a great finnish ad for salmiakki ice cream !, 
  the slogan is `` world 's most hated , finland 's most loved '', 
  pm me for a finnish card !, 
  the beer of the people whose saunas also average a mere +60 c to +70 c , that says a lot !, 
  but finland buys its trains from italy as well ... 
  / r/soumi edit : / r/finmark and obviously glorious / r/yurop, 
  i thought it was already decided roaming fees would end in 2014 ? 
  that was pretty neat indeed !, 
  and every saturday the finnish guards would throw people in a heat-chamber and whip them with birch branches .
