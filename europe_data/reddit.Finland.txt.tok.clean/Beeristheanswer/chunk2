  indeed , we must simply let the money trickle down . 
  naturally . 
  we were born in the darkness , moulded by it ... 
  i hate winter and the darkness , but the strong contrast makes the short summer even better imo . 
  finland in the summer is such a beautiful place , and all the people suddenly become beautiful as well , after hiding under heaps of warm clothes and seasonal depression . 
  it 's like a huge rush of joy of life when the darkness goes away . 
  i feel so relevant !, 
  how dare you insult my mother like that ? 
  why do you assume only poor people oppose tuition fees ? 
  you strike me as simply spoiled , getting offended over this . 
  what do you think is more common ? 
  african immigrants or black canadian immigrants ? 
  you feel people mistaking you for those immigrants you seem to despise because you 're entitled and sheltered are somehow offending you . 
  go do something useful instead of bragging about how much pocket money you get to people who are trying to help other people and mistook you for an african immigrant . 
   since only men were in the army in soviet union it became men 's day . 
  [ incorrect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_women_in_world_war_ii )  there were 800,000 women who served in the soviet armed forces during the war . 
  nearly 200,000 were decorated and 89 eventually received the soviet union 's highest award , the hero of the soviet union . 
  some served as pilots , snipers , machine gunners , tank crew members and partisans , as well as in auxiliary roles . 
  this is an 85 year old . 
  she should not be kicked to the curb after a lifetime of contributing to society . 
  is this a private landlords problem ? 
  but the problem is much bigger that person a not paying person b rent . 
  person a has been fucked over and ca n't do anything about it , she 's old and needs to be done with working to provide shelter . 
  the firefighters refuse to be part of such inhumane action and are making a statement against this . 
  society should provide her a decent living , but it ca n't function with greed and foul play . 
  austerity is the workers paying for the mistakes bankers made . 
  when it was still a license it costed a little shy of 250 $ a year , regardless of income . 
  also , if your share is less than 50 $ you do n't have to pay at all . 
  personally i did n't own a tv for a long time , now i have one because a co-worker was getting rid of an old digital receiver , but i rarely watch it . 
  that said , i think it 's a pretty good idea . 
  but now , since it 's a tax , i hope they try making better tv instead of wasting millions on the rights to a flopped dance competition concept called `` got to dance '' and going to kenya to film [ a shitty movie about mannerheim ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upp-qntrlqu ) as some sort of a joke ... 
   apparently there is a suggestion that one should start charging people the tv tax , even if they do not have a tv , just a computer . 
  just came today , in my opinion not very likely . 
  finland just switched from tv licences to a tv tax that includes everyone . 
  0.68 % of your income , but it does n't go over 140 $ / year . 
   close to absolutely nothing left is actually what i wrote . 
  many people in spain and greece ? 
  not to mention the third world countries involved . 
  the workers earned it for him , his wealth is rising to obscene amounts that he will never be able to use in ten lifetimes , while the workers have it harder and harder . 
  is n't it shady to get money by manipulating economies while the people have close to absolutely nothing left ? 
  i 've never heard of anyone who * earned * billions of dollars . 
  different cultures . 
  kissing is very personal and intimate for us nords . 
  i know , i know . 
  things can get a bit wild sometimes ... 
  finland : * strangers : handshake * relatives : hug or handshake * friends : depending on the friendship , anything from verbal acknowledgement to a hug * business partners : handshake * men + women : good friends might hug each other , other situations it 's a hand shake or verbal . 
  * women + women : tend to me more huggy , otherwise same . 
  * men + men : same as men + women . 
  sometimes it 's appropriate to give a quick kiss on the cheek while going in for a hug . 
  here the qp with cheese is one of the very few things that can make me feel regret for going vegetarian !, 
  my humble vision of heaven is a perpetual bad hangover with unlimited instant qp meals and something good on tv . 
  anecdotal , but eating at an american mcdonalds is one of the few things i clearly remember from being over there as a kid.that 's how bad it was . 
  i had a double cheeseburger that looked like nothing but buns on the outside . 
  when i opened it , i found bright-coloured goop and one slice of a zombified pickle resting on top of what i assume was the patty . 
  no , what you described is a very specific kind of marxist-leninism , that many would argue is more accurately called state capitalism . 
  an authoritarian vanguard party - state is not what socialism means . 
  it means the worker 's ownership of the means of production . 
  communism is a classless , stateless society where the means of production are held in common . 
  socialism is an economic system where worker 's own the means of production , not a state taking your stuff . 
  then they restored it with the [ freedom act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usa_freedom_act ) !, 
  unbelievable . 
  it 's a joke about the title !, 
  til euthanasia is legal in finland . 
  [ stubb ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/vaalit/stubb171210stl_vl.jpg ) might be a vampire , but i do n't think he 's romanian ? 
  charlie chaplin * killed !, 
  no no no , you do n't roll up the moss , you roll around * on * the moss naked . 
  this is how finns mark their territory as well . 
  source ? 
  finnish , swedish and english fluently . 
  some not-so fluent german and a little bit of spanish , not enough to be able to have a conversation yet . 
  yes !, 
  the means of production should be freed to the hands of those who work them instead of being forcefully seized by capitalists as they are currently . 
   in a free market capital society you value freedom . 
  free to choose . 
  and it works by having individuals working together while perusing their self interest . 
  this is what i value as a socialist . 
  these are socialist values . 
  not that `` forced equality '' - silliness you believe in . 
  read the article you are commenting on and find out !,

  [ aww you 're so mad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndhtdl9a ) :(, 
   all men are created equal said the slave owner ... 
  again , i have n't claimed trump is a fascist . 
  his behaviour and actions give way to fascists who feel emboldened and are being normalised and defended by people like you who say those who are against fascists are somehow fascists themselves . 
  trump calls the media fake and `` the enemy of the people '' he talks about `` making america great again '' and riles up hate against muslims in particular as a common enemy . 
  does this make trump a fascist ? 
  can one draw parallels of fascist movements in history with this behaviour and the movement forming behind it ? 
  most definitively . 
  how are these things absurd ? 
  as several people have told you in this thread , looking at history and recognising parallels is not absurd , it 's factual . 
  no-one is saying simply `` trump = hitler '' it 's just a strawman you built . 
  claiming that there 's no fascist elements in right-wing populism littered with actual neo-nazis ? 
  that is absurd and purposefully ignorant behaviour . 
  where did i say trump is hitler ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   it was not until the 1970s that she decided to break her silence , after witnessing the german police shield right-wing extremists against protesters . 
  `` the next day i joined the association of the persecutees of the nazi regime '' - [ esther bejarano ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/world/europe/auschwitz-orchestra-survivor-sings-anew-in-rap-group.html?_r=0 ) , an actual auschwitz survivor , as opposed to someone who allegedly was born five years before the reich fell , was n't persecuted by nazis and moved to america at the age of 13 * and when googled only shows up on right-wing bait sites *, 
  that woman 's name ? 
  albert einstein . 
   punch a nazi and the nazi 's will think it 's okay to punch a liberal , communist , centrist & other conservative .
