  do n't open up the flood-gates for violence . 
  do you seriously think nazis just have disagreeing opinions and might * start * behaving violently when confronted ? 
  part of being a nazi * is * literally to think it 's okay to ~ ~ punch ~ ~ ** genocide ** people . 
  nazis are fucking violent , they constantly attack anyone who disagrees or looks `` wrong '' to them . 
   a criminal using criminal means to achieve success in a market . 
  that 's so totally not `` capitalistic '' !, 
  / s am i doing it right ? 
   anticapitalists.org something tells me this website is n't exactly trying to be a non-biased source of news ... 
  hah , a true case of `` does n't matter , won eurovision '', 
  wtf did i just watch ?!, 
  cute twin rainbow power ranger girls though . 
  thought of it like this as well and had to choose holland . 
  it even sounds funny when they speak their native language , easy choice . 
  a reasonable question to which i think beer is the answer . 
  where is the double standard ? 
  islamists are also frowned upon . 
  `` extremist islamists would react similarly or worse , therefore i will defend the fascists doing it '', 
  there is no way someone is really this stupid . 
  i 'm calling troll on this one . 
  about 5 % of our population are swedish-speaking . 
  my dad is one and my mom is finnish-speaking , so i grew up bilingual , but my native language in my records is marked as swedish . 
  many swedish speaking finns are bilingual , save a few areas in central finland and the archipelago where most only speak swedish and swedish-speaking finns are the majority . 
  all our street signs are in both languages , what language is on top of the other is determined by which language is spoken by the majority of people in the area . 
  i understand where you 're coming from and agree , but it does n't change the fact that many of the reds were nothing but poor young boys who wanted nothing but more rights , hence it 's relevant to ztiller claiming that europeans have n't fought and died for workers rights . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  most reds did n't want to become part of the soviet union , they only fought against oppression and inequality and for rights for workers . 
  greetings dear neighbour !, 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war ) is some fighting and dying for workers rights , right across the pond !, 
  i 'm sure sweden has something too . 
  why is the working class not working ? 
  leave it to an american to take the opposite side when the working class demands something . 
  how is this racist ? 
  so it seems i 'm from a place with the highest percentage of light eyed blondes , but dark haired , brown eyed girls are the ones that really make me weak in the knees . 
  damn it . 
  an immature , violent , egocentric , irresponsible neo-nazi ? 
  how odd !, 
  oh my god where has this been all my life ? 
  please repay us in gyros greece . 
  i ca n't be the only one whose mouth actually starts watering when i think of eating salmiakki ?

  [ hammers and cycles ] ( http://maddogmedia.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/hammer_and_cycle-31.jpg ), 
  so how are things in latvia ? 
  family background probably has lots of impact , but then again finland has for a long time had the bourgeoisie vs. the proletariat-mentality in its people . 
  the green party has the youngest following , followed by the youthful leftist party that has a bit more age-diverse crowd being the result of the merger of the finnish people 's democratic party and the finnish communist party . 
  the older leftists as well as the center-leftists are generally more with the social democratic party . 
  i would assume that older green partiers would be center voters . 
  i ca n't vouch for every region , but generally , at least in the bigger cities the youth are very against the basic finns and the populism , xenophobia and closeted , some times even blatant racism and homophobia they exhibit . 
  all i have written is absolutely non-factual and merely my personal observation on the matter . 
  mostly green party / leftist party voters in finnish youth . 
  might be less the further up north you go . 
  the fact that our president for the last twelve years was a strong activist for lgbt equality and how my perception of my people has always been that of a smart , open-minded one for the most part , i can only say i am dumbfounded and in disbelief seeing the shitty points finland got . 
  as a socialist , calling obama either one angers me . 
  come at me bro, 
  also , jalla jalla !, 
  how about [ myrlejonet/muurahaisleijona ] ( http://schniffel.blogg.se/images/2010/myrlejon_96799634.jpg ) ? 
  did he ever turn out to be nice ? 
  i remember that bastard scaring the shit out of me as a kid . 
  once i was climbing a big rock and trolldad told me myrlejonet is coming for me . 
  i practically carved into that rock with my bare hands climbing it up in panic and refused to come down for an hour . 
  still remember that day . 
  fuck that thing and fuck my evil dad . 
  the number one nightmare fuel for all finnish kids at some point ... 
  it must be [ ut\u00f6 ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/ut\u00f6,+\u00c5land+islands/@60.2273234,24.2334324,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x468b59f84c7e8d9f:0xcc85058692e3f8a6 ) , i guess . 
  the name literally translates to `` out island '' . 
  flat beer , flat mountain . 
  ( southwestern ) finland : `` kundi '' , '' \u00e4ij\u00e4 '' and `` j\u00e4tk\u00e4 '' are the usual ones . 
  no idea if kids use something different these days ... 
  i trust them to fuck the poor with their neoliberal `` trickle-down '' economics .

  swedes tend to talk a lot and be excessively concerned about feels to the point that it sometimes feels disingenuous . 
  this can get a bit annoying when working with them , because so much time is used exchanging pleasantries and making sure everything is sunshine and rainbows instead of [ getting shit done ] ( https://www.virallisetlinkit.eu/site/9430.html ) . 
  they 're good , fun company outside of that , though !, 
   far-right socialist wew, 
  `` kruuna/kruunu tai klaava '' in finland , wonder where we got that from ... 
  / r/suami we mainly talk shit about everyone else ( especially sweden ) and link to posts mentioning finland, 
  besides my native finnish and swedish , english . 
  i mostly use it at my job as we have foreigners working with us from time to time . 
  2 $ : 4x finland , 1x estonia , 1x spain 1 $ : 1x finland , 1x germany 50c : 2x finland , 1x spain , 1x ireland , 1x germany 20c : 5x finland , 1x portugal , 1x belgium 10c : 3x finland , 2x germany 5c : 3x finland , 1x greece ( no 1 or 2 c coins in finland ), 
   in finland , they are mandatory by law no they are n't . 
  they ` recommended , not mandatory . 
  southern finland : it can get over +30 \u00b0 c sometimes , 25 \u00b0 and up is called a heat wave . 
  15 \u00b0 and above is t-shirt weather . 
  when it goes above 30 \u00b0 the streets are filled with naked drunk people beacuse all common sense evaporates from our brains . 
  i 've even witnessed people talking to strangers when it 's that warm , complete anarchy . 
  money spent on fireworks and temporary art installations etc. 
  that year , not much of actually developing anything more long-standing like funding small libraries or creative spaces or something . 
  native : finnish and swedish fluent : english nowhere near fluent : german that 's an interesting question , a language barrier is not something i could imagine as a reason not to travel somewhere . 
  when all else fails , hand gestures will work . 
  why would the language barrier be a deciding factor ?

  during summer , when it 's bright , warmer and lovely , we drink outside all day and night to celebrate . 
  we have the [ vaahteraliiga ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaahteraliiga ) in finland . 
  i played as quarterback for a few years as a kid !, 
  a commie/nazi ? 
  what political opinions does a communist nazi have ? 
  because they are full of people from stormfront . 
  what about all the stories of mad teachers and peer pressure ? 
  like this article for example ?
