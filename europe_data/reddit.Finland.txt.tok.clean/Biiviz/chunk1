karelia has been raped and pillaged . 
  there is nothing left for us there . 
  the f-35 is not the type of aircraft that is suited for finnish needs . 
  finland needs a capable but cost-effective airplane such as the gripen jas 39 e/f or further developed versions , not some insanely costly airplane that only the us and countries with much higher budgets can afford to buy and maintain . 
  what 's the point in buying the planes if you ca n't afford enough of them and the flight hours needed to train and intercept ? 
  so what you 're saying is that they 're the only party in finland that does what they promise . 
  probably why they have such loyal voters as well . 
  during ww2 we made booze from left-overs from paper mills . 
  of course , but because of the austerity measures the process has been sped up by several hundred percent . 
  they are in fact causing urbanization by this . 
  if you live on the country side it 's a lot more obvious than for those in cities . 
  the basic service is disappearing from local venues to centralized venues in bigger towns . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  this operation was a total waste of time ; give those children sex slaves back to the mobsters and move on . 
  norway can be the crust on my balls any day . 
  the fact that russian paratroopers were captured and exchanged for ukrainian troops should be a hint . 
  yup . 
  same red wooden houses with white corners , same little islands dotting the coastline , same looking people , same products in stores ( but with different package ) , same world views , the list goes on ... * it 's almost like we used to be a country *, 
  bad taste to involve that flag in a discussion about actual nazis . 
  quality control , environmental regulations , lack of fraudulent marketing and likely also the placebo effect . 
   natural gas is used in some combined power plants producing electricity and district heat . 
  to expand on this , gas usage in homes is practically non-existent . 
  the direct effect on the general populace would be slightly elevated electricity prices until the import has been switched to norway/estonia . 
  ** tl ; dr : `` finland most vulnerable to russian gas cut-off '' is technically right , but gives an entirely wrong image of the situation . 
  the difference :  open skies is an agreement that aims to promote transparency and security in europe . 
  the agreement allows the signatories to conduct observation flights and take aerial photographs over the territories of its member states when ** these have been planned and announced beforehand . 
  i 'm fine with sweden 's goal of turning from a nation into a global charity organisation as long as they get the fuck out of the schengen area first . 
  their neighbor 's neighbor is the problem though . 
  there 's a couple of swedish high-ranking officers blogging about the problem . 
  the main problems are a lack of artillery , lack of land - and sea-based anti-air , as well as trained personnel and tank drivers , but the list goes on . 
  the current state of the swedish military means they are only able to defend the stockholm region . 
   finland joined varzaw pact no . 
  do they even / r/v \u00e4lf\u00e4rd ? 
  sorry ` bout the lumps , i 've been wearing tight pants . 
  one of the greatest bands to ever come out of sweden ; raubtier . 
  [ raubtier - l\u00e5t napalmen regna ner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ycq0f3ozgo ) ( `` let the napalm rain down '' ) completely absurd romantic lyrics about war , death , diesel and gun powder . 
  unofficially dubbed `` pansarrock 'n' roll '' . 
  eloquently sung in swedish with the broad accent of norrland ( northern sweden ) . 
  even though they have loads of great songs , this one is my oldest friend . 
  it helped me rise from the dead after a 5 day drinking binge .

  calling it a '' - phobia '' makes it sound irrational . 
  we have every reason to keep russia at an arms length - or more . 
  ah , yes . 
  the good ol' novgorod wars . 
  those were nice . 
  we have to go to school too . 
  poor us slaves .

  the english version is the same :  however , half felt that the system should be reformed in some way which means everything and nothing . 
  article from 2013 :  compulsory army service for men retains a high level of support amongst the finnish public , according to a poll commissioned by the magazine suomen kuvalehti . 
  the majority of respondents -- around 80 percent -- were in favour of maintaining some form of compulsory military service in the country . 
  * http://yle.fi/uutiset/finns_still_in_favour_of_mandatory_military_service/6864762 and the support for it * increased * by 8 percent from the previous year , not the other way around . 
  the `` all-time high '' quote is from the same gallup from the previous year ( 2012 ) iirc . 
  approval of conscription is at a peacetime all time high of  80 % . 
  almost like something an idiot would do . 
  a ) * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area#customs_controls  however not all schengen states or all of the territory of schengen states are part of the customs union or vat area , so some controls on goods entering or leaving the customs union and/or vat area are inevitable . 
  some other countries want to have customs controls targeted at illegal goods , such as drugs . 
  * http://yle.fi/uutiset/armed_norwegian_police_cross_into_finland/7380515  `` norwegian police do n't usually appear armed , and drivers heading to norway do n't usually have their documents checked . '' additionally , the russian border is [ so close ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vpg5mzj.gif ) that the customs buildings from before the schengen agreement was implemented ( anno 2001 ) are probably still in use . 
  there needs to be infrastructure and systems in readiness for these types of situations . 
  b ) one can only speculate . 
  most likely due to co-operation and/or budget cuts . 
   `` norwegian police have asked us for help . 
  they asked if they could come over into finnish territory with weapons . 
  police commanders have the mandate to allow that . 
  i 'm now in charge when the police chief is away and i approved it , because the customs buildings on the border are located on the finnish side , '' kinnunen explains .

  finnish : '' \u00c4l\u00e4 opeta is\u00e4\u00e4s nussimaan '' - `` do n't teach your father how to fuck '' . 
  the meaning is similar to `` you 're preaching to the choir '' . 
  what do you mean `` without problems '' ? 
  had they left the property on the date they agreed on then it would have been without problems . 
  this article exist precisely because it was problematic . 
  that would n't distract anyone from the real issues . 
  some blog is not a `` newsworthy event in finland '' . 
   this actually became a newsworthy event in finland : [ 6 ] because some blog ( ? ), 
  apparently mentioned it ? 
  your definition of `` newsworthy event in finland '' is extremely loose . 
  what makes you think tzarist russians were any less barbaric than communist russians ?

   there is a history to label anti authoritarians as mentally weak or even ill , so i 'm not surprised that you would go there . 
  yeah , i bet they have entire hospitals filled with `` anti-authoritarians '' . 
  if you 're just gon na skip all the arguments you do n't have a response to , i 'll just quit here . 
  good luck `` stickin ' it to the man '' !, 
   yes school is totally the same a military service , children in school ca n't leave , have to obey every order of the teachers , ca n't leave for home and have no free time . 
  `` yes conscription is totally the same as slavery , recruits are abducted , put in containers , sold to sex trade , held for ransom , or murdered . '', 
  exaggerations work both ways .
