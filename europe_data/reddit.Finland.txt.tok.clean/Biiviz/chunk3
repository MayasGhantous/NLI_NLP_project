  plus shooting lots of guns , anti-tank weapons , detonating explosives , shooting out locks in doors , throwing grenades and clearing rooms is * fucking awesome * . 
  add to this all the people from every class in society that you spend 24 hours a day working and living with . 
  it 's a great way to get some perspective , learn to understand and make friends and for some - to get them away from their mothers and computers . 
  tl ; dr : the military service is what you make of it . 
  if you screw around and just feel miserable , you 're wasting your opportunity . 
  compact description of how it works : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhley4uiqno, 
  well , what are you supposed to do when you 're in a cottage in the middle of the woods with a bottle of booze and a girl who can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch . 
  about 1500 people live here , coastal village . 
  pros : * no people - no stress . 
  * everything 's clean . 
  * close to nature ( hunting , hiking , skinny dipping , sporting ) . 
  * lots of summer cottages for parties with bbq , sauna , swimming , sodomy , etc. 
  * 100/100 mbit optic fiber and 4g municipality-wide . 
  * talkoot - voluntary unpaid work done by citizens for other citizens , such as building community houses for kids to hang out in cons : * no people when you want them . 
  * most women around are low-educated bimbos : hairdressers and the like . 
  * hillbilly mindset of some people . 
  * lack of stores , most importantly : no alko . 
  * only one bar with `` the regulars '' . 
  * everybody knows everybody ( good and bad i guess ... ) * lack of schools and higher jobs . 
  * 18 year olds driving around in their cars with over-sized subwoofers , blasting some shitty dubstep or whatever . 
  makes you feel * my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 * aka second-hand shame . 
  even the genes are different . 
  south-western finland and north-eastern finland differs more than say england and italy , if i recall correctly . 
  the difference between finnish and american military spending is that we do it as cost-effective as possible . 
  does n't apply in this case . 
  in finland , gas is essentially never used in direct heating of homes , which are heated by direct electric heating , oil or district heating . 
  75 % of gas is used for production of electricity or combined heat and power and in industry , with domestic use being rare . 
  in total , 93 % of the gas is sold to large installations directly rather than by retail . 
  the use of gas ovens is so marginal that statfi does n't even consider it . 
  100 % reliant on russian gas , yes , but that only accounts * for 10 % of our total energy needs * . 
  the bigger problem is that the rest of the energy sources are also largely coming from russia : oil ( 65 % ) , coal ( 72.5 % ) , and nuclear fuel ( 18 % ) . 
  percentages are of the total import of each type of fuel . 
  oil for example is 65 % rus , 11 % nor , 11 % den , and 13 % others . 
  ah , yes . 
  the penis empire shall * rise again * . 
  exactly . 
  messed up algorithm . 
   you 're spanish at heart . 
   for the spanish , the cinema 's like a second living room . 
  they go to the flicks more often than anyone else in the eu . 
  they do n't drink much coffee , nor are they particularly optimistic about the future . 
  perhaps that 's because they do n't think their country 's economy is in very good shape . 
  ... i answered that i never go to the cinema and drink lots of coffee . 
  and nobody 's economy is in `` very good shape '' . 
  maybe russian revisionists believe stalin was a good guy ? 
  a guy from bulgaria came to my uni for exchange studies ( 6 months ) . 
  he was a nice guy . 
  funnily enough , he told me that one of the reasons he went on an exchange was to show the world that bulgarians are not all gypsies . 
  so that 's something , i guess . 
  finland was a poor agrarian country with quite little industry up until the post-war era . 
  due to massive war reparations demanded by the ussr ( who refused to admit they invaded ) and without the marshall plan the country had to shock-industrialize itself to be able to afford paying back . 
  since then the country has quickly gone from having nothing and being crippled by war damage to becoming what it is today . 
  also known as one of the `` finnish miracles '' . 
  we do . 
  best finnish song of all time : [ dudududududududu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrloyuvkzh4 ), 
  `` values represented by nato '' ... 
  same type of aggression as russia , except russia has attacked the west instead of some sandbox . 
  both do it under the guise of `` protecting people '' . 
  finland played the cards it was dealt . 
  we 're used to flying solo when the world turns to shit . 
  the radio conversations between estonia and the rest is pretty creepy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90wllyted8k you can hear their last words : `` it looks really bad right now '' . 
  at this point they had a  45 degree list . 
   putin the boggy man boggy \u02c8b\u00f4g\u0113 / adjective 1 . too wet and muddy to be easily walked on ; marshy . 
  `` the shrub grows naturally in boggy ground '' synonyms : marshy , swampy , miry , fenny , muddy , waterlogged , wet , soggy , sodden http://i.imgur.com/grruwkx.jpg, 
  just tag him as a troll account and move on . 
  like we 'd touch some shitty ass russian vodka . 
  now * there 's * a bond villain worthy of its name . 
  the 's no point in having nuclear weapons if nobody knows you have it . 
  not to rain on your parade but when russia starts dropping megatons , mankind is on the brink of extinction anyway . 
  keeping it relevant , i see . 
  you 're right . 
  the fdf of the 30s did n't even have uniforms or ammunition to go around . 
  the fdf of today is the best equipped it has ever been . 
  the helsinki metro has room for helsinki 's entire population and can take a direct hit from a nuclear weapon up to a few 100 kilotons . 
  about 50 % of the population also has secondary houses in the wilderness that can be used for hiding out and living off the land . 
  / edit : 100s of kilotons , not 10s . 
  holding territory requires troops on the ground . 
  putting troops on the ground leads to casualties . 
  we 're ready to inflict those casualties . 
  iirc , finland has a grain supply to last the entire population at least 3 months . 
  most people do n't care . 
  well , it * is * your biggest export . 
  impressive post . 
  thank you . 
  it 's under renovation . 
  sure . 
  enjoy your weekend . 
   i 'm somewhat unenthusiastically saying our army might be right , and you 're saying i should say that of course our army is right . 
  i 'm rather saying professionals are more likely to be right than armchair generals on reddit . 
  there are some pretty shitty comments on the finnish newspaper comment sections as well . 
   there are many reasons why the army could be right , but it 's also a political beast fighting against social and economic constraints . 
  absolutely . 
  i feel like we 're getting side-tracked though . 
   or losing the tanks would mean less need for a conscription army etc etc. 
  conscription is one of the best deterrents we have . 
  losing the tanks does n't really change that , in my opinion at least . 
  we 'd have to make major investments in weaponry and changed tactics to fill that void , though . 
   so i 'm saying that the army is n't necessarily making the best defence choices , it can just as well be choosing based on what 's politically advantageous , or what maximises the funding they get , or what the ideology of the current decision-makers is ( c.f. 
  how officers are accused of always fighting the last battle they had , not the one that 's ahead ) . 
  yep .
