  a variant of this is done in every single demonstration/protest/riot to try and justify the ones fighting the cops as `` the good peace-loving guys '' , whatever the cause .

  \\  aggression literally coming back to the lands that were stolen one year beforehand . 
  some stayed at their own houses . 
  so what differs poland from sweden ? 
  grenades are n't counted as weapons by swedish customs . 
  it 's a hole in the system . 
  the grenades are smuggled from eastern europe . 
  because r/europe is troll central, 
  ca n't tell if sarcasm, 
  seeing how shitty dog owners can be ... might as well call some of them wild animals .

  i would n't eat the two together however . 
  forced meme = / = finnish conspiracy theory, 
  yle news is the obvious choice . 
  usually objective to the point of being dry . 
  just perfect . 
  an alternative was the golden lion with an armored arm , wielding a western sword while trampling the eastern saber , on top of a deep red background . 
  then the red color became synonymous with communism and it was dropped . 
  heard it commonly in hki , tku , vsa , jkl , and more . 
  please . 
  vaasa , the white city , is the only * true * capital of finland .

  the comics usually do n't even have a punchline . 
  so is an anus . 
  they do n't share their grenade attacks with the rest of us . 
  :'( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21165485.ab they 've hogged 30 of them in malm\u00f6 in 2015 , and have n't given us * any * . 
  sweden , yes !, 
  this is so progressive . 
  not to mention finding mass graves on a weekly basis . 
  i , on the other hand , was referring to estonia being slightly less developed , with cheaper alcohol and tourists coming down to get shitfaced like the usa-mex relationship . 
  shush , finnish mexico . 
  get back to sleep under your cactus . 
  leftist swedish media is just gon na spin it as immigrants being abused by the `` far right '' . 
  politics in sweden is a shit show . 
  balle means penis in swedish .

   1.1 percent of the population of finland  not completely wrong k, 
  yes , and that 's also a greek word . 
  economy is also a greek word . 
  indeed it was :  it [ 1990s animated series ] is based on the moomin novels and comic strips by the finnish illustrator and author tove jansson and her brother lars jansson . 
  it was the third anime adaptation of moomins but the first to be distributed and dubbed in other countries worldwide . 
  not karelia , that 's for sure . 
  perhaps the `` third arm '' aka petsamo area , however the russians would never give up the ice-free harbor and nickel mines . 
   we should n't forget their record , which also includes giving finland its independence , which sweden would n't have done . 
  because they could n't handle the risk of a finnish revolution at the same time as they were handling their own . 
  not a decade later , it was considered a mistake to let finland go . 
  do n't treat them as some kind of philanthropists . 
  to reclaim the finnish lands annexed by ussr 1 year before ? 
  indeed . 
  for comparison , historians place the mortality rate of finnish pows in the ussr at 40 percent during the continuation war . 
  albeit , very few finns were captured ( 900 +3500 during both wars ) . 
  also , soviet `` partisans '' often murdered soldiers and civilians after interrogation without capture . 
   well , we know which genocidal army finland preferred !, 
  yes , obviously we chose the only army in the world willing to stop the * other * genocidal army from murdering the finnish people . 
  your head is not just a hat rack by the way . 
   food was especially scarce in 1942 in finland due to a bad harvest . 
  the total number of deaths among the camp inmates is estimated at 4,000 -- 7,000 , mostly from hunger during the spring and summer of 1942 . 
  bad finns taking prisoners . 
  should 've shot them on site ... except that would be a war crime . 
   germany 's genocidal army invade the soviet union i take it you prefer the soviet union 's genocidal army invading neutral finland ? 
  he knew . 
  his objective was not to get a lawyer . 
  they were speaking normally at first but he started screaming in english about lawyers to get attention and sympathy . 
  the events in this video happened in august of 2009 . 
  the taser entered service with the finnish police in 2005 , but did n't see wide-spread use until years later . 
  i remember reading that the initial batch was 500 units in the entire country , but that article was in paper form so i ca n't find it . 
  either way , very few patrols had them . 
  as of 2015 almost every police car has a taser . 
  however , the police are considering limiting its use after a man who was tased died of heart problems while in custody a few years ago . 
  not me . 
  i 'm the most modest guy in the world . 
  in fact , i got 1st place in a modesty contest . 
  i can outmodest everyone in this thread with my hands tied behind my back . 
  the scale used in the image ; it goes from happy to sad .
