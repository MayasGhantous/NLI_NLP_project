  a happy face coveys positive emotions and a sad face conveys negative emotions to the viewer . 
  \\  implying younger equals better, 
  they all look like [ this ] ( http://networksolutionsbd.com/wp-content/gallery/dome-camera/dome-camera-18.jpg ) . 
  where are you from ? 
  there are cameras in every city in finland too , but no one has made a fuzz about it so you never even knew . 
  the wiki refers to thetimes.co.uk which is paywalled . 
  yes , but he 's probably just thinking that every other country is inferior . 
  [ ultra-pasteurization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultra-high-temperature_processing )  uht milk , if not opened , has a typical unrefrigerated shelf life of six to nine months . 
  flash pasteurized milk has a shelf life of about 12 months , and pasteurized milk about two weeks from processing , or about one week from being put on sale . 
  ________  in a hot country such as spain , uht milk is preferred due to high costs of refrigerated transportation and `` inefficient cool cabinets '' . 
  uht milk as a percentage of total consumption : \\ # 1 belgium 96.7 \\ # 3 france 95.5 \\ # 20 norway 5.3 \\ # 23 denmark 0.0, 
   nice but silent nice * and * silent . 
  silence is golden . 
  machine guns or submachine guns ? 
  they are talking about [ this type of dark bread . 
  ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=rugbr%c3%b8d&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ksfsvyihmcyhsahxpokabw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923 ) we have this too . 
  when finns refer to dark bread or rye bread it 's usually these types : [ ruisleip\u00e4 ] ( http://mauronacosta.com.sapo.pt/ruisleipa.jpg ) [ ruispalat ] ( http://eeelis.ratata.fi/site/data/3589/images/ruispalat_lasi[1].jpg ) these types have wheat because it makes them softer and they need the gluten from wheat to stay together . 
  hehe . 
  i can taste a little puke in my mouth . 
  at 15 we had our own moonshining operation . 
  winter is awesome . 
  it 's important to have trained replacements to be able to rotate battle-tired troops . 
  i know that they in sweden have sweet biscuits called [ `` finska pinnar '' ( `` finnish sticks '' ) . 
  ] ( https://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/8-2/144687/images/2010/finska-pinnar_71597340.jpg ) they are typical swedish coffee bread and have nothing to do with finland . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhrlswwcrvu hopefully the police will put in more resources beforehand next time so that these people will be arrested and prosecuted properly . 
   most of the piece is taken up with rousing and turbulent music , evoking the national struggle of the finnish people . 
  towards the end , a calm comes over the orchestra , and the serenely melodic finlandia hymn is heard . 
  a german girl once told me in bed `` i do n't even let german guys do that '' . 
  apparently i 'm worse than germans . 
  / edit : i wanted consensual romantic vaginal intercourse in the missionary position between two loving adults for the sole purpose of procreation during which we look deeply into each other 's eyes ... nah , i 'm not * that * sick . 
  what a useless statement . 
  they are n't allowed to shoot certain weapons or operate certain equipment unless they get a regulated amount of sleep . 
  it 's mainly a cost issue . 
  the navy can not justify the price for a very specialized craft . 
  i 'd rather see more fast attack crafts with anti-ship missiles , cruise missiles , anti-air missiles , surveillance equipment and mining/asw capabilities . 
  submarines are too expensive for the low amount of value they have in the finnish archipelago . 
   exept people ca n't vote `` wrong '' . 
  that was his point  he 's being insincere . 
  finnish ministry of justice tried this many years ago . 
  it was a failure due to compatability problems . 
  gay guy was the presidential candidate runner-up a few years ago . 
  which is why the thing they do in movies , turning on the shower and waiting for the water to get hot , seems ridiculous to finns . 
  the water gets hot in ~ 1 second . 
  moist maymay , friend, 
  chili nuts , popcorn or nachos with salsa are most common . 
  sometimes free , but usually cost a small fee . 
  i seem to recall another general guvernor being assassinated too ? 
  maybe that was earlier . 
  every country with russia as a neighbor keeps conscription in effect and/or has joined an opposing defense alliance . 
  wonder why that is . 
  is n't the yle-tax a media tax that funds all government media functions such as tv , radio and internet ? 
  the most popular online streaming service , yle areena , is likely funded by the same tax . 
  / edit : according to vero.fi , all yle services are funded by the yle-tax and is max 143 $ ( 2014 ) . 
  i really like madeira . 
  maybe the island would be nice too . 
  your mother, 
  jesus christ will we never get a good neighbor ? 
  russification happened before the soviet union too . 
  elefant tank-hunter, 
  actually , the t-34 / 76 mbt was nicknamed `` sotka '' ( a type of duck ) by finnish troops in wwii due to the silhouette . 
  west and south is where it 's at for blondes . 
  what ? 
  finland has the highest amount of blondes per capita in the world and is likely where the last blondes will be . 
  if the republic of karelia joined us : http://i.imgur.com/rtja1b6.jpg, 
  just because they consume a lot does n't mean they can handle a lot . 
  they are indeed the least retarded band we 've ever sent . 
  it 's obviously not foolproof . 
  the importance of internet usage via phones has grown immensely . 
  laws against buying prepaid phones without id were made to counter a threat that existed at that time . 
  still need a sim card and that requires id . 
  pre-paid phones require id ( national/passport ) to purchase in many european countries precisely to counter organized crime . 
  sharkfin soup is n't all that uncommon . 
  i 've had it in denmark of all places . 
  does n't apply to our delicious marine friends . 
  is this the one and only bubi or one of bubi 's chicks ? 
  been to kfc in m\u00fcnchen , did n't live up to my expectations . 
  normal people do n't eat predators or scavengers . 
  that 's because they move around with caravans . 
  it sure as hell works that way if we 're gon na let them into our countries . 
  chinese are n't japanese though . 
  the japanese stereotype is that of extreme cleanliness . 
  i remember reading a handful of threads about how asian ( japanese ? ), 
  tourists are shocked and disgusted by cities such as paris because of the filth , beggars , and rudeness of locals . 
  if the russians are n't punished for aggressive expansion then the next finno-russian war is coming sooner rather than later . 
  luckily that one is out in the woods somewhere . 
  the one in [ central vaasa ] ( http://kulttuuriymparisto.nba.fi/netsovellus/rekisteriportaali/rapea/read/asp/hae_kuva.aspx?id=108170&amp;ttyyppi=jpg&amp;kunta_id=905 ) looks more churchy . 
  that 's great news . 
  i assume gripen ng will have be able to carry these ? 
  in that case , they finally become proper contenders . 
  swedish air force , navy and army lack cruise missiles . 
  sweden 's policy has been used as a warning example for more than a decade . 
  finnish hippies are some of the most disgusting . 
  they would be living in putin 's russia if it was n't for our military . 
  it think it was a year or so ago that finnish passports were considered `` the most powerful '' because of the number of countries that we could travel to without visas . 
  they 've had some hard times economically while trying to adapt to the budget airlines . 
  looks like they finally found their niche and are bouncing back . 
  their new fleet of airbus a350 xwb are being delivered from 2015 onward too . 
  finnair is the fifth oldest airline in the world with uninterrupted existence , and is consistently ranked one of the safest . 
  their tickets are expensive , but i 've only had positive experiences with them the ~ 15 times i 've used their services . 
  it 's a yearly military sports competition .
