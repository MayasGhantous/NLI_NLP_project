  that year 's competition was perhaps held in finland so they added it to the 2014 showreel . 
  these are n't ads after all , more like summaries . 
  the only video showing ( army ) special forces is about 10 years old : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htfy5tj2z8e, 
  why do they even bother gathering data and compiling statistics when they could just ask you ? 
  only weird foreigners use towels in saunas . 
  then again , nudity makes for bad stock photos ... 
  no , none of that here . 
  stay away . 
  we only have pig meat , equal rights and homosexuals with their heads still attached to their bodies . 
  when i was writing the english exam there were a bunch of students who had the stomach flu and had to sit in the back with buckets next to their desks . 
  always preferred the [ metal version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a247r3mns5a ) . 
  also , thanks for lego , h.c. andersen , p\u00f8lse , tyrkisk peber and aalborgs akvavit !, 
  / edit : and scarlett johansson !, 
  only 14 % of murders are committed with firearms . 
  most murders are committed with edged weapons . 
  600 years together was pretty sweet . 
  we got to keep pea soup thursdays , punsch and * fastlagsbullar * that go great with being drunk in the middle of the day . 
  [ parola tank museum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdrtoliqpco ) every now and then they put on [ little shows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk9ucpi8ms0 ) and bring out some of [ the vehicles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txmq4dkehzq ) that are in operational condition like the t-26 , t-34 / 85 , t-55 , stug iii , comet and more . 
  if you count only the republic of finland , yes . 
  fought by ( what we today consider ) finnish people on the lands they lived against enemies from the east : 1808-1809 vs. russia 1788 -- 1790 vs. russia 1741 -- 1743 vs. russia 1700 -- 1721 vs. russia 1590 -- 1595 vs. russia 1554 -- 1557 vs. russia 1495 -- 1497 vs. muscovy ( russia ) 1142 -- 1322 vs. novgorod ( russia ) 1123-onwards vs. novgorod ( russia ) there are also early wars and conflicts against swedes , norwegians , danes and of course internal tribal wars . 
  [ mlg 420-1 ez game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idb9wuxo2_q ), 
  yes . 
  76 % is one of the highest not only in europe , but * in the world * . 
  the wartime strength is 230 000 , total reserve is 900 000 . 
  [ introduction , eng subs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhley4uiqno ), 
  it 's not specifically banned because it 's covered by animal abuse laws . 
   by the way , would n't they need to use the reserve to monitor the border if it would come to that ? 
  that 's how i remember the article . 
  unfortunately it 's [ pay walled ] ( http://online.vasabladet.fi/artikel/visa/90414 ) . 
  a friend showed me the whole version in school . 
   i 'm a military police by training , maybe i should start to expect a letter from the army !, 
  yep . 
  same here . 
  the finnish military announced that they are ready to mobilize military police to protect the border in case of a crisis . 
  ah , finally finns can live in pea -  palestina  israel fuck . 
   redditor for 33 minutes, 
  i like my climate like i like my metal . 
  swedish arrogance aka `` in sweden we do things * this way * '' is a type of nationalism . 
  we hunt seal in finland too , just not endangered seals . 
  and with rifles not clubs . 
  plus nobody fought ww2 to save the jews . 
  most people did n't find out about that until the very end of the war . 
  people fought the nazis because they invaded almost every corner of europe . 
   talsinki tunnel hellinn, 
  delivery was supposed to be from 2011 onward . 
  by 2013 the sdf had received 4 prototype systems . 
  the most recent news is that the sdf is going to start receiving the systems from october 2015 with 2 systems every month , totaling another year in delivery . 
  stop an enemy from taking and holding swedish territory . 
  you ca n't occupy a nation of people that has the training , tools and will to resist . 
  not a problem for sweden ; they have 4 artillery guns ( out of 24 ordered ) . 
  finland has the highest food prices in europe and at the same time the lowest buying power . 
  finland is split in two subreddits . 
  in reality we 're probably * way * higher than you . 
  likely caused by the aftermath of the failed bird/swine/whatever flu vaccine . 
  also religion in some parts ( anti-hpv ) . 
  a way of counter-acting the information war conducted by the invading nation . 
  whether or not finland had its own lines on a map is irrelevant to people hating the enemy of millennia . 
   two wars oh you sweet summer child . 
  traditions vary from state to state right ? 
  perhaps this tradition is from a state other than yours .

  in ostrobothnia ( west coast ) people go out drinking on the 25th with old friends who return home from other cities and countries during the holidays .

  `` breivik 's swimming school - swim or die ! '',

  he had used a topical analgesic to numb the pain so as to withstand higher temperatures . 
  unfortunately , this led to him being unable to tell when he was past the point of no return . 
  it 's said that the first thing finnish soldiers do when they reach a new place to make camp is to build a sauna . 
  here 's the peacekeeper sauna in afghanistan : [ building phase ] ( http://www.skja.fi/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rekunnusvaihe.jpg ) [ hesco sauna ( made from hesco-barriers ) ] ( http://www.skja.fi/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hesco-sauna-ulkoa.jpg ) [ nsfw ] ( http://www.skja.fi/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hesco-l%c3%b6ylyt.jpg ), 
  fuck off out of ukraine then . 
   what one could call essential to society . 
  and neither is banning legal , documented , controlled guns . 
  banning guns is going to up the amount of `` missing '' weapons and then you 've successfully made a lot of weapons disappear from the radar . 
   public safety you just gobble up anything the eu puts on your plate , do n't you ? 
   police officers can kill any suffering animals . 
  you think the cops have the resources to come with you to the woods when you check your traps ? 
  he 's projecting . 
  that 's why he ca n't assemble more than some nonsensical sentence . 
   i think in finnish school shootings , the guns have been legal . 
  and since then , laws have become stricter . 
  like pushing the age to purchase weapons from 15 to 18 ? 
  both perpetrators were over 18 . 
   which makes sense , civilians do n't really need pistols . 
  pistols are commonly used to kill trapped animals and for sport shooting . 
  while true , the connotation remains . 
  the allied camps are generally called internment camps ( besides the gulags ) and the axis ' camps are concentration camps . 
  the classic `` history written by the winners '' is clear here . 
  1st part i agree , the civil war was a complete shitfest . 
  when it comes to the second point there are a lot of misconceptions and bad terminology . 
  for example , `` concentration camps '' makes it sound like something found in germany or occupied poland even though the wiki has the true purpose in the first sentence : * internment camps * . 
  high mortality was due to lack of food across the entire country and disease . 
  also , your article on `` assisting in brutal activities '' mentions trading pows and interrogation . 
  also the references do n't work . 
  you have to consider the amount of computer nerds on reddit who hate their lives regardless of the weather outside . 
  winter is awesome . 
  if you get depressed in winter then the winter is not the problem . 
  the screenshot is actually from norrland , sweden . 
  israel has tested female service and deemed it a failure . 
  / edit : failure is too strong of a word . 
  they found a lot of flaws with having women in front line roles , though .
