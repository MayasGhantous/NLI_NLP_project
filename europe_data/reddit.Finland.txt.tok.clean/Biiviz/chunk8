  several signs are in both languages , such as the tram stop sign , apothecary , street name , etc.

  dude , in ww2 we did get some . 
  unless you mean help from the us , then yeah , fuck 'em . 
   we should be grateful for any help we got even if the `` help '' was useless or barely useful and came at a high price ? 
  even if they would have bombed us anyway ? 
  you 're still thankful . 
   would you have preferred if finland had been on the other side of the iron curtain ? 
  no , and that 's irrelevant . 
  the us was helping the soviets in the wars they fought against us . 
  you 're still thankful . 
  even if the us conducted espionage on the finnish government ? 
  even if the us aggravated the ussr by flying planes over the fin-rus border ? 
  even if the cia got finns killed in the ussr ? 
  http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/12/finland-and-american-intelligence it took a long , * long * time before the us considered us even close to being on the same side . 
  americanophilia is almost as disgusting as russophilia . 
  the americans would 've nuked us during the cold war to deny the area to the soviets . 
  all major companies like w\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 , abb etc.

  islam classes ? 
  after the wars , finland was forced to pay war reparations to the soviet union `` for having started them '' . 
  however the silver lining is that this forced finland , an agrarian nation with little industry , to industrialize very rapidly , so quickly in fact that it 's now known as one of the finnish miracles :  finland came out of world war ii crippled by the loss of a full tenth of its territory , and with 400.000 evacuees from karelia . 
  productive units were dilapidated and the raw material situation was poor . 
  ** the huge war reparations to the soviet union were the priority problem of the decision makers . 
  ** the favorable development of the domestic machinery and shipbuilding industries , which was based on domestic demand during the interwar period and arms deliveries to the army during the war made war-reparations deliveries possible . 
  they were paid on time and according to the agreements . 
  at the same time , timber exports to the west started again . 
  gradually the productive capacity was modernized and the whole industry was reformed . 
  several trade agreements also had an impact :  finland became part of the western european trade-liberalization movement by joining the world bank , the international monetary fund ( imf ) and the bretton woods agreement in 1948 , becoming a member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) two years later , and joining finnefta ( an agreement between the european free trade area ( efta ) and finland ) in 1961 . 
  the government chose not to receive marshall aid because of the world political situation . 
  besides selling clothing and footwear to the ussr , western trade was also opened up with :  machinery products including paper machines , cranes , elevators , and special ships such as icebreakers . 
  the first small oil refinery was built in 1950 and the government became actively involved in industrial activities in the early twentieth century , with investments in mining , basic industries , energy production and transmission , and the construction of infrastructure , and this continued in the postwar period . 
  this also had a strong positive impact on the standard of living :  public child-health centers , cash allowances for children , and maternity leave were established in the 1940s , and pension plans have covered the whole population since the 1950s . 
  national unemployment programs had their beginnings in the 1930s and were gradually expanded . 
  a public health-care system was introduced in 1970 , and national health insurance also covers some of the cost of private health care . 
  during the 1980s the income distribution became one of the most even in the world . 
  that 's ok slovenika , at least you 're real . 
  not smiling like an idiot when walking down the street in -30 c is not the same as being depressed , as some people seem to think . 
  like the [ bank of finland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/snellman_statue_helsinki.jpg ) in helsinki .

  perhaps you 're right , but what is your finland is perhaps not his finland . 
  who knows , perhaps he was at some of those locations but the weather sucked so he moved on . 
   the lakes and fields of h\u00e4me ( which at least to me is the most idyllic finnish landscape ) the most idyllic to me would be the turku archipelago . 
  it 's a nature video . 
  / edit : ~ ~ you can also tell from the lake shots that it 's not only lapland but also central finland . ~ ~ / edit2 : the description has all the locations . 
  it 's filmed all over finland , from the southern most tip to beyond the wall .

  swedish-danish bron/broen and norwegian skavlan occasionally . 
  did i mention eu anywhere ? 
   why is no one caring about russian lives lost in the plane in egypt likely 'cause the russian people support the russian attack on europe in east ukraine and crimea as well as supporting the rebels who shot down an airliner full of dutch people .

  9 months out of the year . 
  you ( usually women ) bring separate in-door shoes if it 's in someone 's home . 
  in summertime you can sometimes wear shoes indoors if it 's a party e.g. 
  a graduation . 
  and all public building doors have to open outwards due to fire safety . 
  in fact , most doors open outwards due to this . 
   information warfare researcher saara jantunen places putkonen in the so-called ` b\u00e4ckman camp ' , that is a group of individuals who share johan b\u00e4ckman 's pro-russian views .

  oh , now i see what you 're getting at . 
  derussifying karelia now in 2015 would be immoral . 
  yes , well ... duh . 
  i do n't know why you 'd even bring that up . 
  i assumed you were defending the russification of karelia by saying * that the opposite would be immoral * . 
  as if the removal of 400 000 karelians and further deportations from 1939 were the status quo . 
  guess i 'm too used to hearing the russian ww2 apologizers . 
  with that out of the way , let 's get back to what your original reply stated :  derussification would be equally immoral . 
  yes . 
  finland has no interest in relocating karelian relatives back or getting the land areas back . 
  the land areas are a wasteland with severe poverty , rampant alcoholism , lack of proper healthcare and lack of infrastructure . 
  finnish volunteer organizations sends welfare packages to the remaining karelians ever year . 
  as for the karelians left :  in the last decades of the soviet union , ethnic russification ( or ethnic assimilation ) was moving very rapidly for a few nationalities such as the karelians . 
  this does n't mean that russia has no moral obligation to , for example , apologize for the theft of karelia and the decades of abuse of the karelians . 
  instead they 're cracking down even harder and trying to erase any non-slavic traces . 
  russification is a violent and forceful with deportations , killings , suppressed culture , and institutional racism . 
  derussification would be the opposite . 
  status quo is when neither of these take place , i.e. 
  not how history went down . 
  status quo would be if neither happened . 
  but that was n't how history went , was it .
