if they are 20 good men we would send 20 of our [ finest troops ] ( http://craphound.com/images/23v7n.jpg ) . 
  even the romans knew that aestii can not into codanonia . 
  yes , it is * totally * legit . 
  you better start giving us our rightful lands or we 'll send 20 guys to fight you for it . 
  traumatize your children for life , with european cartoons ^ ^ tm, 
  or , you know , they 're leaving sweden because it is * sweden * . 
  as we all know being in sweden is worse than waterboarding and no sane man would willingly live there , which is why there are so many swedes there . 
   discusses placing asylum seekers in his not in use kempele home . 
  fucker should open his * primary residence * to asylum seekers before he `` encourages '' everyone to `` open up their homes for asylum seekers . '', 
  nah , screw that . 
  either you get it [ right ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150323201042/gameofthrones/images/9/97/the_wall_from_the_south.jpg ) the first time or you do n't do it at all . 
  `` part of the cause '' ? 
  are you saying we 're swedish ?!, 
  tomorrow we 'll come over there and you wo n't last 2 hours like you did with germany , you * swedish farmer in denial * !, 
  we 're also very close to sweden and norway , yet you do n't see us dipping below 80 . 
  maybe you are actually * baltic state * in disguise and thus can not into nordic !, 
  when did i say they would 've left us alone ? 
  mainila/1939 was definitely a massive dick move by the soviets but 1941 was just us poking a beehive . 
  sure , it may have been to reclaim the land we lost and `` a bit extra '' , but it sure was n't the kind of `` noble defense of the fatherland '' that 1939 was . 
  i mean , we had concentration camps in east karelia for ethnic russians . 
  about one third ( 24,000 ) of the russian population was placed in these camps . 
  they were supposed to be exchanged for various finnic folk at the end of the war or simply deported to russia . 
  4,000 - 7,000 died between 1941-44 of hunger , thanks to poor harvests and lack of farmers , and disease . 
  not exactly our proudest moment . 
  do n't worry , eesti . 
  we will always love you and your cheap booze , with or without palm tree beaches . 
  ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ going ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ nordic ^ ^ ^ though . 
  but you still can not into nordic . 
  even the women ? 
  i have to say , the finnish creation myth is some of the most drunk creation ever . 
  [ in the very first poem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevala_\\ ( synopses \\ ) ) , runo 1 , the daughter of the air ilmatar is impregnated by the wind and the sea because , as we all know , that white stuff on waves is not really bubbles but is actually cum . 
  and naturally she does n't just give birth to some completely normal baby , ooooh no . 
  what finally emerges from her womb after hundreds of years is a wise , old man with white hair and a long , white beard . 
  we should go in full combat gear , or does this not count as a vacation ? 
  ah ok . good . 
  seriously though , to me neo-nazis are some of the lowest of the low . 
  i 'm positive that we would all be better off if we gathered them all into some remote playground where they 'll have swing sets , sandboxes and crayons to play with . 
   last time i was there the first thing someone told me is do n't go to some bar like directly in front of the train station i just arrived in , `` you 'll probably get stabbed '' pfffff . 
  there 's an entire * district * you should n't go to , called pupuhuhta . 
  there 's nothing but stabbings there . 
  it 's not even people doing the stabbing there , just knives floating around on their own and embedding themselves in anyone who gets too close . 
  ... you 're joking , right ? 
   finally central finland , specifically jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 , is best finland . 
  i thought it was clear where i 'm from . 
  we usually steer clear of turku . 
  only tampere hates turku enough to actually go in there and continue this valiant effort to improve the fatherland . 
  people often say that finland has two assholes , helsinki and turku . 
  helsinki is seen as this wretched hive of scum and villainy and hipsters and hedonist faggots . 
  fairly certain if you stay there for more than a week you 'll just naturally grow thick-rimmed glasses and a handlebar moustache . 
  there 's no explanation for why turku is bad , it just is and every finn knows this . 
  except those living in turku . 
  someone tried to burn it in 1827 , and for a while it seemed to be working but ultimately failed . 
  since then we 've been hoping that something will either launch turku into deep space , never to return , or cause it to sink into the sea . 
  no luck so far but maybe this year it will finally happen , fingers crossed . 
  ostrobothnians do n't die naturally of old age . 
  instead they die when someone strategically places an axe in their chest . 
  there 's also a manhood test that can only be performed in ostrobothnia . 
  it involves going into a bar , any bar , and shouting `` pes\u00e4pallo is for faggots ! '', 
  pes\u00e4pallo is finnish baseball . 
  only ostrobothnians give a shit about it , it 's in their dna . 
  lapland 's population is pretty much just 10 guys , lordi , santa claus and two billion elves . 
  there 's only two things in eastern finland : neo-nazis and the border . 
  the border is where we fight the endless horde of adidas tracksuits coming from russia . 
  they almost broke through in 1939 but fortunately they could n't withstand our superior environment and handsome men . 
  and that 's how we managed to save sweden from total destruction yet again . 
  finally central finland , specifically jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 , is best finland . 
  it 's been scientifically proven that the people of central finland are superior to all other finns in every way . 
  everyone here is very handsome and muscular . 
  we all have 200 + iq . 
  everyone has long , golden blonde hair that is always blowing in the wind majestically , even when there 's no wind . 
  the land is flowing with honey and milk , and inside every tree one can find vodka bottles stacked on top of each other . 
  best of all , no one speaks swedish . 
  one meter long ? 
  wow . 
  i had no idea something that big would even fit in there . 
  how did you prepare for that , did you need to stretch it somehow to make the insertion easier ? 
  awww , if you 're going to compliment us then should we go beat up denmark together ? 
  oh damn , if you 're going to do that we might have to give our troops one more bullet . 
  i wonder if sweden would like to come as well . 
  it might be * [ that time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msc8evcpqzu ) * again . 
  it is completely natural . 
  are you saying it 's not ? 
  do we need to come over there and ruin your fish oil ? 
  come on , you know there 's two kinds of crazy here . 
  there 's the finnish kind that goes `` it 'd be nice to play football but we have no field to play on ... but we do have that swamp over there ... '' and then there 's the norwegian kind that goes `` lets wear itchy clothing and kick hats '' . 
  if you 'd like , in exchange for a little bit of land in slovakia i could send the parliament a picture of my face , brow slightly furrowed in a disapproving manner , and send him crying into his freshly printed drachmas ? 
  hey now , you do n't get to call norway crazy . 
  norway is * our * crazy . 
  only we have the right to call them that . 
  there 's a lot of truth in this post . 
   it 's because it would unnecessarily antagonize russia for little gain . 
  they share a huge border and do quite a bit of trade . 
  trade with russia makes up roughly 10 % of our exports and 20 % of our imports . 
  not something you 'd want to lose even a slice of in our current situation . 
   and also because i think many finns would have trouble placing their country 's destiny in the hands of foreign countries . 
  they could be a part of nato and the rest of the allies just decide that it is n't worth fighting over finland and break the treaty when the moment of truth comes . 
  yes , it 's unlikely , but that 's the attitude that you have to fight against . 
  the baltics are also just as skeptical that nato will aid them if russia invades . 
  i 'd say at least a portion of our mistrust of nato and friends goes back to ww2 . 
  in the grand scheme of things it 's incredibly easy to understand why the allies did n't want to fight the soviets .
