  but it still feels like a massive slap in the face to receive basically nothing more than good luck wishes and `` get well soon '' cards from your friends when you 're being attacked by a bear . 
  really drives home the idea that you should n't count on others for help . 
  ask and hope for their help , but do n't rely on it . 
  lies , we do get sun and it 's usually a very nice day . 
  a good start but there 's still plenty of room for improvement , like fucking staying in saudi arabia until we can smell his rotten corpse . 
  yes . 
  lauantai , where `` lau '' is like `` loud '' but without the d and `` antai '' is like `` untie '' . 
  so like `` lou ( d ) - untie '' . 
  oh yes , scotland . 
  you can into nordic . 
  just say `` lauantai '' . 
  you stay out of this , denmark . 
  do n't make us come fight you for 2 hours . 
  edit : i 'm starting to think that may have been too harsh . 
  should i go find him and apologize before he starts crying into his vandgr\u00f8d ? 
  eesti still can not into nordic . 
  nonsense . 
  everyone knows we 're the descendants of the terrifying vikings , as opposed to just regular vikings like the danes , swedes and norwegians . 
  they were just too scared to leave home . 
  i think you forgot some [ vital details ] ( http://imgur.com/gp8of0i ) . 
  but do horses come from horsens ? 
  easy . 
  [ like so . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ), 
  by that same logic i suppose lions come from lyon . 
  that 's not a challenge , that 's friday . 
  that depends , are you ready to prove you have the balls ? 
  first you need to kick cameron out . 
  then you 'll eat hak\u00e1rl , rakfisk , surstr\u00f6mming and whatever the danes use when pranking foreigners . 
  you must wash it all down with salmiakkikoskenkorva and absorb the very essence of [ perkele ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek9y6qwrtg0 ) into your soul . 
  only then will you be true nordic ^ ^ tm, 
  on the other hand it would also place us in the top 15 largest economies in the world , in 11th place ( imf 2015 estimates ) . 
  larger than south korea , australia , spain and russia , to name a few . 
  ... indeed , our russian friends . 
  maybe we should add another little hat to the box . 
  surely that will get people moist ? 
   less long term thinking , more reckless behaviour i remember watching some documentary ( ca n't remember the name right now ) about our perception of time , or something like that . 
  supposedly the further south you go , closer to the equator , the worse people generally are at thinking long term and tend to focus more on the present . 
  the opposite occurs when you head north , away from the equator : people are better at planning for the future . 
  does n't excuse the behavior but could help explain it . 
  pffff , easy . 
  you just take the [ obvious ones ] ( http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2013-11/enhanced/webdr03/26/7/enhanced-buzz-wide-25610-1385467469-21.jpg ) first , then fill in the [ rest of the map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gp8of0i.jpg ) . 
  aw cheer up , sven , do n't be like that . 
  eesti is family and cheap booze , and we just ca n't get those from you . 
  but you know that come hockey season , the only one we want to face in the finals is you . 
  it just would n't be the same without our bff-rival  ^ ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ hurts ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ most ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ crush ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ dreams ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ world ^ ^ ^ ^ championship . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ again . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ den ^ ^ ^ ^ glider ^ ^ ^ ^ in , ^ ^ ^ ^ motherfucker . 
  someone found a [ picture ] ( http://www.worldmapsonline.com/images/murals/miller_world_physical_wall_mural_lg.jpg ) online that finally proved the earth is actually a flat rectangle and all the countryballs were changed to reflect this fact . 
  nah , that 's not it . 
  what happened is that our happiness became separated from us and condensed into a liquid , and we 've been trying to drink it back ever since . 
  yes , alcohol is actually finnish happiness . 
  unfortunately liquid happiness is not really meant for human consumption , which is why it can make you angry when consumed in large quantities and also why it stays only for a few hours in your system . 
  going by temperature our summer is a bit like your `` winter '' except we get anywhere from six to eleven hours more daylight . 
  our winter is a bit like stepping into a walk-in freezer with a fan . 
  you can simulate the snowy days by throwing some shaved ice into the fan . 
  the difference between summer and winter daylight hours looks like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjyt-6hjqw ) . 
  i do n't know about others but i actually like the cold . 
  the way i see it , one can always put on more clothes if it 's too cold , but if it 's too hot there comes a point where you ca n't take anything off . 
  unless you want to grab a potato peeler and start peeling . 
   also `` kymrin/suomen kieli '' is not written together . 
  must have been thinking of suomenkielinen and mixed it with suomen kieli :p, 
  we could always swap kymri to mean wales and use something like `` kymrin kieli '' , `` language of kymri '' , for welsh so it would be kinda like finland = suomi and finnish = suomen kieli . 
  kymru would n't work because it violates our sacred vowel harmony ^ ^ tm . 
  ca n't have \u00e4 , \u00f6 or y in the same word with a , o or u. 
  neither . 
  it 's not even indo-european . 
  op did n't cover scotland so here it is : skotlanti, 
  still behind switzerland but those fuckers cheat by being surrounded by mountains . 
   1 ) finland , aww , i too would stand a reasonable distance away from you . 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:continuation_war_december_1941_english.jpg ) . 
  our troops stopped at the old border pretty much only on the [ karelian isthmus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:finnish_advance_in_karelia_during_the_continuation_war.png ) , with `` a few corners straightened out '' . 
  next year we 'll have phones made of wood . 
  a year after that cars made of wood . 
  finally we 'll go to space and conquer the stars on a rocket made of wood !, 
  if you 're swedish we have just the lake for you . 
  it 's called [ ruotsalainen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruotsalainen_\\ ( lake \\ ) ) , literally `` swedish '' ( person , not the language ) . 
  sure . 
  can we just pretend basque is a finno-ugric language ? 
   step 1 - replace all liquid intake with vodka  if you are n't careful , you may turn into a swede !, 
  no no no , that 's not how you make a swede . 
  you need to drink cheap champagne , dress like a hipster and speak gibberish like a prissy little princess . 
  do that and you can then move to sweden . 
  nonsense . 
  the proper sauna experience ^ ^ tm leaves you absolutely covered in sweat , like you just came out of a shower . 
  if that does n't happen then it 's probably some weak german-style sauna you just hopped into . 
  [ perkele ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek9y6qwrtg0 ) !, 
  but if we annexed estonia then where would we go for cheap booze ? 
  clearly this requires celebration . 
  just remember , no more than 3,600 liters for personal use . 
  great , now even lithuania is dissing us . 
  we might have to take [ drastic measures ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kmh4bbjpz8 ) to fix this . 
  we already did , that 's why they changed it . 
  they could n't handle our team of handsome and muscular medieval lawyers . 
  [ hahaa , foiled again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzx1zl_svti ) ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ hate , ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ best ^ ^ ^ `` neighbor '' ^ ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ ^ after ^ ^ ^ ^ norway . 
  we struck a deal with mexico , they get uk 's spot in the eu and in return they help us ship the british isles to the americas ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ ^ ireland jokes aside , just read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54o51j/hello/ ) . 
  you 'll understand . 
  yes , and then we 'll have [ a sick national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo7msifwn44 ) , and we 'll build a pipeline through the north sea and the baltic sea , from amsterdam to helsinki and from helsinki to tallinn , and we 'll fill the whole thing with beer and vodka . 
  we could form the swamp thing union and always be one rank ahead !, 
  not enough consonants .
