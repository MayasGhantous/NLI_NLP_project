  despite the fact i 've already provided you precedents for age scams and the skewed ratio between sexes . 
  yes , i provided the overall numbers for the refugees in my link , the other link was for denmark for studies done to so called children . 
  [ 17 % of the flow were women , 29 % were children and 57 % were male ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php ) best case scenario there are 31.5 % females of any age , which is unlikely due to numerous scam claims of ' 16-17 year old ' men http://swedenreport.org/2015/04/14/sacrificing-1000-to-save-1/  in denmark , 3 out of 4 `` children '' arriving the first months of 2012 turned out to be adults . 
  so the likelihood that 3/4 are male scammers is somewhat high, 
   a lot of them are women and children is a fact , it 's not dishonest at all . 
  you are selling the idea that there 's a lot of women , compared to what ? 
  to the overall refugee/immigrant quantity or just general ? 
  you do n't specify for very reason why i called you out as dishonest . 
  if we compare the overall numbers here we 're getting fraction of ... ^ ^ ^ ^ worldpopulation . 
  but if we 're talking about the flow of immigrants that arrived to eu last year women and children make very small minority . 
  saying we 're getting a lot of women , children & men generalizes the term and laymen will consider they amount to same . 
  even if the ratios were 9:1  please . 
  it has everything to do with race . 
  what does `` 3rd world '' mean other than `` brown people land '' ? 
  did i write brown people land or 3rd world ? 
  you are the one generalizing the term here for whatever reason . 
  we can discuss about semantics if you feel like it but 3rd world countries are just places . 
  i think that includes north korea too , and last i checked they 're not brown so your term `` brown people land '' needs some honing . 
  i linked the picture because it looked funny and popped to my head , and regards to media you can see k\u00f6ln & not so distant past where it came into light how swedish media suppressed news in regards to immigration problems in certain festival though it was was n't center point , as i already edited the original post, 
  no , saying a lot of them are women and children is intellectually dishonest , we both know it . 
  i 'm annoyed that you , and people like you are trying to market this whole ordeal under the name of children & women when it 's going to cost trillions of euros and will in all likelihood fail catastrophically , and what we get is overwhelming majority for ungrateful 18-25 year old males that cause direct consequences to already working infrastructure ( very heavy cuts in retirement funds and education in finland at least , not to mention the infamous queues for housing in sweden ) calling people that come from 3rd world countries or me 3rd world habitants , or me habitants is n't racist , it has nothing to do with race . 
  i already mentioned how i linked the fastest swede because the picture looked funny , or the claim did . 
  we already went thru the whole process of ` they 're women and children ' last summer so give me a break . 
  i do n't care about his age that much , the picture just represented what i was aiming for , that the whole thing is bullshit . 
  even if he 's very mature 14-year old , the fact that we 're sitting with surplus of 3rd world habitants from which overwhelming majority are 18-25 men is fucking ridiculous to market as children and women . 
  my original was that they already tried selling us the image of children & women and how exactly it turned out ? 
  i just brought the fastest swede because it came to my mind , and didnt think there would be so much triggering to it, 
  so you got no source , and i 'm the one lying , because you say so ? 
  i do n't think that 's how argumentation works in real world  .  and how it 's lying ? 
  i just pointed out that he 's fastest 14 year old swede . . ? 
  wow wow , so now we 're stooping to personal insults , what 's next ? 
  i 'm nazi racist and then we 're going to move onto the mom jokes ? 
  yeah there 's difference for physique , only thing is that we 're looking at someone that looks like adult , not a prepubescent teen , or teen . 
  that 's why the picture itself is funny , whether he 's 14 or 24 does n't matter in the discussion, 
  my original point was that we 're already been sold the idea about women & children which turned out to be bullshit . 
  what was his age is n't really debatable unless we 'll start generalizing every immigrant from me and 3rd world to this particular case, 
  can you provide source for that , please ? 
  i forgot , people from 3rd world and me are always honest in sweden . 
  questioning something they say is racist in there ... :d but yeah , he might be a 14 year old in the picture , just looks like adult , but there 's more than enough precedents already in the scam section to prove that there 's trend, 
  then do you xray test age ? 
  oh you got source on that ? 
  but recently we had age tests by tooth xray that revealed that 90 out of about 140 were lying about their age and rest were concluded to be withing margin of error or as lying about their age , the margin of error ends at 20 years . 
  so propaganda or not , they still lie about their age, 
  [ here you can see fastest 14 year old in sweden ] ( https://janmilld.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/14ar.jpg ) yeah , we already had this bullshit from media last year already e : whether he 's very mature 14 year old is not the center topic for discussion , the fact that we 've been already fucked over with the promises of children & women is . 
  and because it turned into bullshit regarding the picture i 'm clarifying : http://yle.fi/uutiset/ikaarvioiden_luvut_julki__90_alaikaista_turvapaikanhakijaa_todettiin_taysi-ikaisiksi/8650891 ( 90 out of 149 tested ` minors ' are adults , error of margin has to show you as 20 year old ) http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php of all immigrants 17 % are women and 26 % are untested minors / identifies as minor http://swedenreport.org/2015/04/14/sacrificing-1000-to-save-1/ which states :  in denmark , 3 out of 4 `` children '' arriving the first months of 2012 turned out to be adults . 
  though i chose the witty image because it looked funny . 
  whether he was 14 or 24 was past the point , which i tried to clarify . 
  the fact that we 're being marketed children and women as the refugees is dishonest at best . 
  what 's that ? 
  nuclear weapons found in iran ? 
  well it 's for the greater good . 
  politics realize that trying to sidestep the issue will shit your career, 
  i do n't think the guy in the video is moving to europe , better yet to germany or sweden, 
  i do n't know which is worse political islam or dictatorship without malicious or insane leader . 
  i raise you [ google page for finnish food ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=finnish+food&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjkzlssmetkahxefywkhu4wbekq_auibigb ) then again there 's memorable [ video about unfortunate iraqi deserter that did n't like our porridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgyh61yvydo ) or it might 've been rice but he forgot to bring sauce / chicken whichever they had at that time . 
  e : if you come to finland buy as much salmiakki/salty liquorice you can eat, 
  the secret to success is to never reveal it , something romanians seem to have taken into heart . 
  i do n't think metal detectors are sarcastic though , nor the missing journalists, 
  i think that 's the one he 's talking about, 
  does it make it any more less correct though ? 
  is there anything more valuable but your own people ? 
  the one where russian said to fuck his life because he earned a little, 
  you forget the part where they rob your taxes to pay for it , after which they kick you down the hole, 
  i think the south park episode handled pretty well the pc issue , shame it takes too long to kick in though, 
  they 're selling it to their audience , which happens to be european at this particular case . 
  polls without pie charts are 90 % more disappointing than ones with one . 
  well whatever happens - or not , i fear next summer , and the people coming to europe will be the end of eu . 
  the wave of ` refugees ' we already received was merely a tip of the iceberg and we 're going to see whatever lies under the waves very soon , unless drastic actions are taken , but knowing how incompetent eu pretends to be we can be sure that unless major happening nothing will change . 
  hence i wrote families with pr worth, 
  not enough families with pr worth it seems, 
  i do n't think your tactics where you expect to fight down to last finn is gon na work if its in your own soil . 
  but our offer of suur-suomi stands, 
  here 's the link for the thread , im not translating it https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4426b6/finnish_broadcasting_company_state_funded/, 
  and that 's when they lost last remaining credibility they had, 
  there 's post about it too in europe now, 
  those that do not know , the speech got censored by our state funded broadcasting team . 
  the censoring happened to the part where he says people are getting into europe on false pretenses and they 're not removed either . 
  e : link to the thread https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4426b6/finnish_broadcasting_company_state_funded/, 
  the crazy ones hold as much as power as the sane ones . 
  there 's one crazy even elected as chancellor so one might argue they hold more . 
  yeah , does me got anything else going besides oil money ? 
  i wonder what happens once alternative is found . 
  i do n't think that time is not too distant either . 
  what for you 'd need arabic though ? 
  what will they contribute to society in the future that children should be taught it ? 
  unfortunately some politicians will think this is good idea , so whether he 's nobody or not does n't matter to those politicians . 
  being spineless in general . 
  see ww2 and winter war . 
  their war plan is practically fighting to last finn and surrendering after it . 
  yeah that sounds he liked the idea of it , not what it has turned into . 
  albeit by the help of usa & rest . 
  that 's pretty big statement made without sources , almost as big as me claiming he would 've wanted best for his people , which under current affairs is not happening . 
  monster or not , he valued german people . 
  i dont think i could say the same for the current leaders of germany . 
  whether we 'll see next war in europe due to their decisions today ? 
  hard to tell , but it 's not improvement for eu . 
  that 's for sure . 
  because rather than trying to teach minority , which i can only assume will remain as minority atleast during next generation , they 're suggesting cramming language to schedule that 's already crammed . 
  not to mention one of the hardest languages in the world , and they 're suggesting of making it mandatory . 
  totally not fucking , say english skills .
