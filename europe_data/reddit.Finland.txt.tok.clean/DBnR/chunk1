  i do n't know about the other countries , but according to [ this ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/wikileaks_snowden_seeks_asylum_in_finland/6713860 ) , his application to finland is invalid because he was n't in finland . 
  i 'd like to see finland or any other eu country grant him asylum , but i do n't see that happening , what with extradition treaties and what have you . 
  i can see how you might think that if you 're not aware of the size of the bread .

  i do n't know how to brake this to you , but your friend may be imaginary . 
  dial up your sarcasm detector a bit . 
  what did we ever do to you to deserve this disrespect of our national identity . 
  i think riga is a reasonably popular city break destination , and i 'd like to visit sometime . 
  that 's about it i 'm afraid . 
  my courses vary from 3-15 points . 
  the required amount of points for a diploma differ from 210-270 in the universities of applied sciences ( polytechnic , [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_applied_sciences_%28finland%29 ) ) and 300-330 points in the proper universities . 
  * [ vladimir puting put on a criminals list ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/police_chief_putin_data_was_from_published_sources/6578243 ) * [ teacher fired for forcefully removing a student from school cafeteria ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/heinaluoma_to_mtv3_teacher_dismissal_should_be_cancelled_as_illegal/6578215 ) . 
  this sparked a big , ongoing debate on what a teacher can/can ' t do to misbehaving students in order to keep order in the schools . 
  * in sports : ice hockey is still a thing , and kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen finished 2nd in the chinese gp ( formula 1 ) . 
  that 's about it for finland . 
   the largest decreases were registered in finland ( -7.5 % ) ... is that not as bad as it seems , or should we start drafting our bailout letter ? 
  [ an interactive page with the same info ] ( http://www.unicef-irc.org/report-card-11/ ), 
  i 'm paraphrasing here , but he was being a dick . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fexulvadxog ) a video of the incident . 
  basically the teacher is asking the kid to leave the cafeteria ( for reasons not apparent from the short clip ) , and the little brat is mouthing him off and being disrespectful , so the teacher `` assists '' him out of there . 
  there 's * usually * no need for ( finnish ) people to beg in finland , hence the lack of beggers . 
  you 'll see romanian beggers on the streets ( at least in helsinki ) during the summers , though . 
  there 's also been some talk about criminalising begging to to `` fix '' the problem of foreign beggers . 
  yeah , but if you could buy a case of beer for $ 6 in finland , we 'd drink ourselves to death in no time flat . 
  so probably better this way . 
  why the hell not ? 
  it 's gorgeous , 
  i think this interview was made while the pm and his euro-buddies were on a `` retreat '' in lapland . 
  not the sort of setting where a suit and tie is appropriate . 
   for one thing , all you have to do is look at the gigantic split that 's opened up between german unemployment and unemployment in the rest of the eurozone to see why there 's so much anger about the status quo . 
  i 'm not saying there is n't a divide between the north and the south when it comes to economic success , but is n't comparing the german unemployment figures ( with their mini-jobs ) to the rest of us a bit like cherry picking your stats ? 
  the division would n't be so `` gigantic '' when comparing other well-off countries to the struggling countries . 
  or did i completely miss the point of this article ? 
  you 're right , ridiculous is maybe too strong a word . . 
  but still , what 's going on in hungary right now is n't really comparable to the nationalism in nazi germany in my opinion . 
  i do n't know if people are `` pissed off '' , but there is roughly one summer home ( or cottage ) for every ten finns , so many city-folk still spend their summers and long weekends in their summer homes , in peace and quiet , as far away as possible from other people . 
  i think what he said/meant was , when you bring up the nazis in a debate , it 's only when you could n't come up with anything relevant anymore and you 've essentially lost the debate , but wo n't admit it ... ~ ~ i 'm not sure what my point was , since comparing the hungarians to the nazis in this case is obviously pretty ridiculous . ~ ~, 
  very interesting indeed , and a welcomed distraction from all the cyprus/euro news lately . 
  reminds me of the stories behind some unusual place names in finland . 
  the story goes that when swedish cartographers came to town , the people would come up with funny fake names to fuck with the swedes . 
  i 've also heard they might 've given the funny names to their neighboring villages to mess with them . . 
  i do n't know if either of these stories are actually true , but whatever the reason , there are some hilarious places in finland , such as : * kusip\u00e4\u00e4 ( ass hole , lit . 
  piss head ) * vitunvihelt\u00e4m\u00e4aapa ( ca n't translate , something about a whistling pussy ) * per\u00e4suolijoki ( rectum river ) * kusij\u00e4rvi ( piss lake ) * terska ( foreskin ) * mulkkusaari ( cock island ) located on kivesj\u00e4rvi ( lake testicles ) * pallivaha ( ball wax ) * homeperseensuo ( moldy ass swamp ) * isom\u00e4llineva ( big cum bog ) and my personal favorite * tissinpohja ( bottom of a tit ), 
  afaik it does n't mean anything , just a made-up word . 
  i quess the vatti-part might be derived from watti ( watt ) but i 'm not sure . 
  is this in estonia ? 
  same goes for finland , except for the most common surname . 
  after korhonen , the most common finnish surnames are : * virtanen ( virta = stream , current ) * m\u00e4kinen ( m\u00e4ki = hill ) * nieminen ( niemi = cape , peninsula ) * m\u00e4kel\u00e4 ( also derives from m\u00e4ki = hill ) * h\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen ( lit . 
  a person from the province of h\u00e4me ) * laine ( = wave ) * heikkinen ( heikki = a common first name ) * koskinen ( koski = rapid ) * j\u00e4rvinen ( j\u00e4rvi = lake ) etc. . 
  most finnish surnames will have something to do with nature . 
  there 's a good reason why most things related to space * exploration * come from nasa these days . 
  they do it more . 
  when it comes to this planck business , most of the news articles i 've read about it credit esa , even the nbc one you linked to . 
  maybe not , but the overall direction the polls indicate does matter . 
  [ this website ] ( http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/scottish-independence ) / u/akasa linked to shows quite clearly that the percentage of people who are for independence has gone down steadily since 2005-2006 . 
  i do n't claim to know anything about brittish/scottish politics , and this downward trend might be reversed , but for now there * is * a clear trend . 
  i wo n't even pretend to understand the full implications of these findings , but this bit of the article made me feel all sorts of excited : `` but because precision of planck 's map is so high , it also made it possible to reveal some peculiar * unexplained features that may well require new physics to be understood . 
  so , what do the latest opinion polls have to say about this ? 
  and more importantly , is there a generational gap ? 
  try / r/eesti ... also , liivi means vest in finnish . 
  so now you know . 
  the public opinion or this petition does n't guarantee that , but this is one of those things that will happen sooner or later . 
  but the fact that this petition has gathered so many names in such a short amount of time and the fact that polls show the majority of people are for equal rights , it should make even the most stubborn mp realise they 're fighting a losing battle and they should vote ` yes ' just to get some points , especially from young people who are n't yet old enough to vote . 
  according to the last poll i saw about 30 % of people were against it . 
  some 60 % for it , and the rest were n't sure i guess . . edit : 57 % for , 32 % against to be exact, 
  the finnish trade union confederations and the confederation of finnish industries ( representing the employees unions and employers unions , respectively ) are having their negotiations on what will be the framework for the employee benefits , wages and such for the next year . 
  unsurprisingly the biggest hold-up seems to be whether or not the employees should get a pay rise . 
  the confederation of finnish industries says there 's no way in hell they 're going to increase wages , and at least one of the trade union confederations ( the biggest one , sak ) wo n't accept this . 
  so this will dominate the news for a while . 
  might sound boring , but in a highly unionized country this is important stuff and affects more or less anyone who has a job ... and anyone who wants a job for that matter , since they also negotiate the unemployment benefits ( the unions own unemployment benefits , not the federal ones ) . 
  also , it 's that time of the year again when beggars from romania and bulgaria are appearing on the streets of helsinki . 
  or at least are expected to appear shortly . 
  this is an annual problem , and politicians usually blame the countries of origin for not taking care of their own people . 
  according to vr.fi and matkahuolto.fi ( train and bus services respectively ) an isic card does n't entitle you to said 50 % discount , or any discount for that matter . 
  tried reading about slovenian politics on wikipedia , only to come to the conclusion it 's equally confusing everywhere . 
  i hope it 'll all work out in the next elections . 
  as for rehn , he 's probably not * that * bad , i just have my opinions about the guy . . 
  he must have one of the suckiest jobs in the world tho , considering how well things are going in the euro-zone . 
  for as long as the people feel their independence day is worth celebrating , they are independent . 
  happy independence day , estonia !, 
  the obvious answer is ` yes ' , but when you start thinking of ways to do that , it 's not so apparent anymore . 
  as the eu is inching towards being a federation i 'm starting to understand why the us has so much trouble getting anything done . 
  quite frankly i do n't think eu-wide democracy could ever work , considering how different the countries are culturally and otherwise . 
  at least i ca n't think of a way to get it done fairly . 
  there 's been some ( not very serious ) talk of a nordic federation , and even that has too many hurdles to overcome to ever become a reality , i do n't see how it could work on an even larger scale . 
  is there any chance things will get better after the elections ? 
  are there any national polls that show the majority of the population being dissatisfied with the government and the way things are going ? 
  it seems there 's often a tendency for over-correcting when things get tough , and that just leads from one extreme to another . 
  is there a generational divide when it comes to how people think the country should be run ? 
  you might 've guessed i do n't know anything about slovenian politics , hence the questions . 
  i would n't be to bothered about what olli rehn says about your economy , he could n't brake even on a change machine . 
  i agree . 
  maybe not a subreddit , but a post like this once a month , on the last friday of the month . . ?
