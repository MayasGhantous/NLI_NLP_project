you have to remember this statistic counts slightly overweight people too . 
  unless you are over 27-28 bmi it most likely does n't even look like you are fat . . 
  i would rather be a little bit overweight ( bmi < 27 ) rather than a skinny stick . 
  you know even a few thousand regugees costs hundreds of millions of euros ? 
  ye we all just live on that sweet welfare money the government gives us , 
  10000 a lot ? 
  meanwhile germany 1 million . . the u.s should take a few hundred thousand to few million emigrants . 
  yep , his comment makes absolutely no sense . 
  so everyone should study german , english and spanish in europe ? 
  i believe it was sarcasm as he is finnish himself , not sure though . 
  what ? 
  finland has like 10 times better army than sweden rofl . 
  congratulations from finland !, 
  do n't know much about the country tho . . except that greeks hate it for some reason . . , 
  or an even shorter version : yy , kaa , koo , nee , vii , k uu , seittem\u00e4 , kaheksa , ... , ... 
  i feel bad for you guys . . and the thing is that the dumbness is spreading into finland too . 
  does n't mean that in 2100 we should have 50 % immigrants . 
  what ? 
  we are very far from being `` the new greece '' rofl . 
  yep , close to helsinki actually . 
  are you implying it 's that cold in finland or is this a joke ? 
  it has been like around +25 to +30 in the recent days and even in the winter the temperatures are most often around 0 to -10 celsius . 
  spanish sounds pretty cool . 
  please no . 
  as a finn , estonian just somehow sounds stupid and drunken . 
  the thing is probably the same vice versa though . 
  not exactly a british thing ... 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone does the once in a while . . 
  is my favourite . 
  it really is a proper sentence . 
  brown and hairy people ? 
  funny how probably the rest of the world thinks that about turkey . 
  we even call you `` karvak\u00e4si '' which means `` furryhand '' . 
  reminds me of [ this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/hvlouzdnj90?t=40s ), 
  for some time , but then they wanted to `` russify '' it , but i am glad we got our independence . 
  they teach french everywhere in europe . 
  [ here 's one . 
  ] ( http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/the-world-s-biggest-vodka-drinkers-vodka-consumption-per-person_chartbuilder-3.png?w=1024&amp;h=1701 ), 
  some of those questions were just too random for me , especially the law ones . 
  having been to both sweden and estonia , definitely sweden . 
  i just do n't see the finns love for estonia here . . they were part of the ussr for quite a long time and they have a big minority of russians ( 25-30 % ) , which you can still see there . 
  because i think everyone would consider being in jail `` worse '' than doing civil service . 
  it is fair . 
  they want you to go to the army , not civil service . 
  more people would go to civil service if it was 6 months, 
  imo that 's so far fetched . 
  even the swedish word min ( my ) is a lot closer to min\u00e4 ( i ) , while minun ( my ) in finnish . 
  but it 's not impossible that we have some same roots in our languages thousands of years ago . 
  how is ben similar with min\u00e4 ? 
  me ( english ) is a lot closer . 
  very distant by language in our small langauge group , pretty much like comparing slavic ( russian , polish ) to romance ( spanish , italian ) . 
  what ? 
  what 's up with poles being everywhere according to you guys ? 
  iirc you can only advertise alcohol after 10pm here . 
  ( on tv ) . 
  funny considering poles drink much more vodka than we do . 
  [ here .

  [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita ), 
  imo that ef page is quite bullshit . 
  poles better in english than belgians ? 
  everybody knows how bad the level of english is in poland . . 
  the people you talk with ? 
  i think you are in the 1 % since you are speaking english , which 99 % of russians do n't . 
  and oil . 
  that 's just like saying you are missing out on the benefits of smoking tobacco . 
  but still there is great support behind cannabis and anti-tobacco when cannabis is much worse for you . 
  the cannabis culture is very different in north america than in europe . 
  [ here is proof . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adult_lifetime_cannabis_use_by_country ) when around half of americans have used cannabis atleast once during their lifetime , that number is around 10 % in the nordic countries ( including sweden ) . 
  it 's still very unhealthy ( mouth cancer ) . 
  or a straight man and a gay man . 
  yes , we almost had a gay president , do n't know if we would have been world first ? 
  well , he 's finnish , so of course he knows what estonian sounds like . 
  weird/drunken finnish . 
  yeah , but it 's not that bad . 
  [ we are about the same as belgium , but a little bit higher than other western countries . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ), 
  why the hell are you writing in french then in english ? 
  you guys are fat !!, 
  no but really , mc ` donalds is popular here too , but the thing is that we have a local ( finnish ) fast food chain ( hesburger ) which people want to support and it 's ~ ~ probably as big as ~ ~ bigger than mc donalds in finland . 
  that would explain why they are not number one here . 
  this guy is irrelevant nowadays . 
  he is/was also a soviet union ass kisser . 
  and we wont leave the eu , most people are supportive of the eu . 
  about a hundred years under the russian empire , meanwhile about 600 years under the swedish empire . . 
  sounds like sweden . 
  it 's not racism to be against immigrations , there are many problems with immigration . 
  [ here is a speech by a true finns politician about it . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/r_2hjx4uuuk?t=5m4s ), 
  for example , rovio made angry birds , you have probably heard of that . 
  also , supercell made clash of clans and a couple other mobile games , also probably heard of the game . 
  very good , they should have cut even more , or completely . 
  portuguese people hate spaniards source : some of my friends are portuguese and they hate spain . 
  do n't let these articles fool you , the internet speeds in finland are n't that great . 
  i live about 30km from helsinki and the best internet we can get here is 5/0 .5 speed ( 5 down 0.5 up ) and whenever you go to youtube you get 200 ping in games . 
  very true , our hate is mostly against muslims and russians . 
  i especially hate those somalis and romanis using full on robes and hoods .
