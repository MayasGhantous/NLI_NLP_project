  some of these would n't cross an average finns mind either . 
  i doubt anyone except the very anti social would rather stand in a heavy rain than go to the shelter . . 
  not really a surprise . 
  agree . 
  we owe africans nothing . 
  i find it weird that portugal is 5th , we are 11th and the netherlands is only 21st ? 
  nah , it 's full of russians nowadays . 
  same thing here in finland , but it 's around 15-30 cents iirc . 
  what ? 
  how are our cultures is any way similar to estonians ? 
  just because they copied our national anthem , does n't mean our cultures are more similar , compared to sweden for example . 
  how is the finnish and estonian history alike ? 
  finns share a lot more history with swedes compared to estonians . . we do share the same language tree and ancestors , but that 's thousands of years ago . 
  in modern ( ~ 1000 years ) history we definitely share more with the swedes , having been part of them for 600 years or so . 
  well we do n't really exist , so i quess you ca n't really find us anyway . 
  where are we !, 
  please . 
  the poor ones would benefit and the rich ones would n't so it wont happen in the near future . 
  winter war 1939-1940 never forget . 
  difference is , they have been here for hundreds of years , but the russians in the baltics have been there for around 50 + years . 
  also , the swedish speaking population is about 5 % , whereas in estonia the russian population is about 25 % . 
  even by comparing these two articles by name , you can see the difference . 
  [ russians_in_estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia ) [ swedish-speaking_population_of_finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish-speaking_population_of_finland ), 
  what ? 
  what else do you use to cut cheese ? 
  we have never qualified for euro or world cups . . 
  6-1 #neverforget perkele suomi finland edit : [ check this out . 
  apparently after this iihf tournament we are 3rd and you are 5th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iihf_world_ranking ) suck it sweden . 
  i have to say it triggers me when people call us finns mongols or tell here on / r/europe that finland and estonia are like brothers ... no . . just no . 
  well . . a fourth of your population is ... i 'll show myself out . 
  well finnish is related to hungarian , yes , but very distantly . 
  basically like comparing spanish and german or russian and swedish . 
  they are related , but distantly . 
  estonian is closer , like comparing swedish and german ( both germanic ) . 
  i 'd say finnish is `` closer '' to swedish in the sense that we have a lot of loan words from swedish , whereas i could n't understand a single word of hungarian . 
  lol . 
  estonians worrying about the safety in finland ? 
  give me a break . 
  your country is a massive shithole that 's 10 times less safe and they complain about the safety in finland . . rofl . 
  in arabic you mean ? 
  well if you come here expecting everyone is an introvert like / r/europe makes you believe , then you 'll be in for quite a surprise . 
  mcdonalds/burger king are a lot better than hesburger . 
  somehow everything is almost twice as expensive in hesburger than in mcdonalds . 
  when mcdonalds was advertising their 1 euro cheese burger , a bit later hesburger started advertising their cheese burger ( same size , everything ) as a 2 euro burger . 
  also , their food is slightly worse . 
  agree , and their prices are double of what the prices in mcdonalds are . 
  it 's a joke , nobody really stands this far from each other , they are probably walking there . 
  natural selection . 
  in short : no . 
  it 's terrible . . worst 60 euros spent ever . 
  every capital city does . . 
  do people really consider ww a luxury brand ? 
  lol edit : almost all of their day to day cars are very ugly . 
  trump is a genius ? 
  ( nero means a genius in finnish ... i wonder if it comes from the caesar . . ), 
  that moment when our gdp per capita has stayed the same for 10 years . . and other countries have added about 10k to it . . 
  countries in europe are a lot more diverse than the states in the us . . 
  same here . . is it a mistranslation or does `` tammi '' have a whole different meaning i 've never heard of ? 
  why would you need anything on your eyes or face in that temperature ? 
  mohamed hahahaha . . 
  rather with the batteries , car might not start . 
   but you are more unique . 
  in europe there is only you and hungary that use this group of language . 
  but the languages are almost as far away as possible . 
  finnish is part of the finnic side and hungarian part of the ugric side . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.american-languages.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/decsy_1990_k%c3%bcnnap_1998_uralic_tree_01.png ) it 's basically like comparing indian or iranian with germanic or italic languages . . [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.linguatics.com/images/indoeuro02c.jpg ) look at the timelines , saying that we share something in common because of our language is a joke . 
  that 's pretty much like saying indians and germans share the same beliefs or food culture due to their `` shared history '' . 
  it was asked in the state of europe survey . 
  considering yourself european does n't mean you ca n't consider yourself a person of x country as well . 
  krepo and sjokz . 
  chocolate lots of terrorists/muslims , brussels , spa , they speak french or dutch ? 
  not yet , still almost a year to go . 
  same here ? 
  not a murder . 
  it was an accidental kill ... 
  he kicked him once , in no intent to kill him , but the guy got knocked out . 
  he then left the hospital too early ( the victim was a junkie ) and died to brain hemorrhage . 
  it does unless you are retarded . 
  i do n't think the police in any country attract the best and the brightest . . 
  give a mouse a cookie and he 'll want a glass of milk . 
  i thought we were mongols ? 
  what happened ? 
  very few people live in the northern part of finland which is where the homicide rate is higher , so just a single event could swing it a lot . 
  well they do , at least the russian ones i 've seen . 
  wtf ? 
  i thought we were mongols ? 
  25 years ago ... ? 
  what 's so weird about that ? 
  they have a lot of russians in there . 
  russian and english atleast share a bunch of loanwords , whereas the shared vocabulary between finnish and hungarian is close to 0 . 
  only the grammar is structured the same and some ancient words like `` water '' are pretty close , but not enough to be mutually intelligble . 
  also swedish and finnish share a lot of the same vocabulary , so technically finnish is closer to swedish and other indo-european languages than hungarian . 
  it 's certainly not coming back to ukraine unless a miracle happens . 
  the crimeans wanted to be a part of russia and they got it . 
  most of the population there was ethnically russian and spoke russian at home etc. 
  russia is also richer than poor ukraine . 
  700 + year old tradition . 
  great article , the title is a bit misleading as it makes it seem like pure western propaganda .
