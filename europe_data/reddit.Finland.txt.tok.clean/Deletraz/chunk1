i kind of like this new , slightly dicky sweden with a spine . 
  you got adjusted by the literal grammar nazi . 
  ( `` it 's just an exercise ! '' ), 
  i would n't say finland ( or sweden ) were piss-poor to begin with . 
  as a student , i refuse to consider anything that 's more than a week away in the future . 
  not to forget cut-rate yoghurt and butter . 
  me and other students are having an early christmas , food 's usually so damn expensive here . 
  so your idea is to connect finland to the network ... how ? 
  build a tunnel from turku to stockholm ? 
  frietkot , fuck yeah . 
  i 'm ok with this . 
  at least the recovering alcoholic was n't the one who proposed [ mandatory contraptions ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2010121712881350_uu.shtml ) on all wine boxes sold within eu so that everyone would know how much they 've had and no one would get drunk by accident !, 
  they just forgot to fill it before they took that pic for the map . 
  relevant username ... ( `` rainbows '' in finnish ), 
  quixotic indeed . 
  has the dude even bothered to visit finland ? 
  i do n't he 's been in a single interview ( about the elections ) here nor has he updated his twitter or blog about the subjects in hand . 
  dude , we tried . 
  loans they 're not expecting to get back , ever . 
  there would n't be much fuss about loaning if it was actually that . 
  this is seriously getting a bit old now . 
  we 're looking into a tunnel solution already . 
  although it 's not like you 'd take a boat to another country just to buy booze or anything . 
  beer powers some fucking miracles . 
  at least here , the whole conversational field is pretty much saturated with either these right wing hillbillies shouting their arguments on facebook with shitty grammar , and then world-hugging leftists saying finland is open for everyone because love is universal . 
  and i 'm just sitting here masturbating . 
  sipil\u00e4 already said this flow of asylum seekers is more of a problem than our current economic situation . 
  ^ ^ love ^ ^ that ^ ^ you ^ ^ used ^ ^ the ^ ^ letter ^ ^ \u00e4 ^ \\ ^ __ \\ ^, 
  any photo source i 've seen has n't represented anything but tracksuit-wearing , tractor-driving , cheap-ciggy-smoking hicks . 
  come on , even if a lot people are against uncontrollable immigration , who do you think will show up for a demonstration in tornio ? 
  how would you picture folks who 'd participate in such events in sweden ? 
  i 'd guess they 're not the finest of your country , either . 
  i 'm all for some control on this refugee subject , but jesus christ i do n't want to be in the same boat with these turds . 
  i 'll start investing in tracksuits now that they 're still cheap here !, 
  after viewing that page for some minutes , i 'm kind of in the mood for a blow now , though . 
  i do care !, 
  i fill my tank on russia 's side of the border ... 
  ok , enlighten me : why is this a thing ? 
  nah , i 'm pretty sure it 's named after [ a liqueur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vana_tallinn ) . 
  well to be honest , you 're paying [ an awful lot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid#official_development_assistance_by_country_as_a_percentage_of_gross_national_income_in_2013 ) considering you also spend a lot on humanitarian immigration . 
  if i recall correctly , un suggests spending something like 0,7 % of gdp on development aid . 
  but if the current spending is what the majority of the country votes for , you should keep doing so . 
   they are particularly fond of claiming that care of the elderly is in a bad state because of immigration . 
  when in reality , many of the problems sweden has can not be fixed with extra resources . 
  the problems in healthcare * could * be fixed with extra resources , but the spending on healthcare and eldercare is on a whole another magnitude compared to development assistance and such . 
  assistance eats one percent of gdp , healthcare [ takes 9 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/healthcare_in_sweden#financing ) . 
  so yes , cheap populism . 
  moving money from one instance ( taking immigrants ) to other ( humanitarian aid ) would probably mean cutting some of the whole `` helping people of other countries '' budget . 
  i can kind of get that if they ca n't get other parties to cut from taking immigrants part ( or have they , actually ? 
  i do n't know how this spending has developed in sweden ) , they 'll propose cutting down humanitarian aid ... that is , if their underlying idea is that they 'd like to spend less on the matter in general . 
  but yeah , not really loving the neonazi connections and cheap populism they seem to be a fan of . 
  i , too , have always figured that moving a fraction of a country 's population to malm\u00f6 saves lives and solves humanitarian crises . 
  i 'd think that using the same amount of money closer to the epicenter of the crisis ( in form of refugee camps , hospitals ) is more efficient , helps a larger part of the population and does n't strip people of the connection to their home country . 
  ninja edit : not trying to say people should vote for sd , though . 
  i do n't know enough about swedish politics to take a stand in the matter . 
  finland for reference : cleaning personnel get a minimum of 1385 $ per month ( trainees only , but you might be a trainee for months ) . 
  lager in finland is 4.88 $ according to [ pintprice ] ( http://www.pintprice.com/region.php?/finland/eur.htm ) , so you 'd get 284 pints . 
  pretty average , then . 
  that 's shitty and unfortunate . 
  :( i hope you get a better experience from here !, 
  yes , we tend to go ... dutch . 
  well then . 
  i guess you should take one of those cheap flights ( weeze - lappeenranta for example ) and see for yourself !, 
  ... yes ? 
  it 's now officially delicious . 
  i know , right ? 
  when we had the second round of the presidential election with niinist\u00f6 and pekka haavisto , i found myself thinking : `` shit , i 'm completely ok with either of these two getting the job . '', 
  she 's cute , but also actually a robot . 
  population-wise , dude !, 
  had the differential failed , the driver would 've still been able to brake . 
  thanks for your insight . 
  so , what do you think they 're going try ? 
  some talk in the media suggests they 're forming a minority government alone . 
  that would be awesome . 
  well , some number crunchers get to decide if it 's a good move or not . 
  and that tunnel from tallinn to helsinki !, 
  although as much as i like the concept , the cost estimates are pretty ridiculous ... 
  it 's punk . 
  we do like metal , though . 
  anything can happen if there 's just five people voting . 
  that , or they just liked the other performances better . 
  it 's kind of a knee-jerk reaction to go whine that europeans are intolerant for not liking hc punk when they just voted a bearded drag artist to be their queen . 
  strippers are n't bdsm . 
  estounian-finis rileiss\u00f6nsip is t\u00f6 best prat\u00f6rhuud in t\u00f6 norttern j\u00fcrop . 
  the depth charge in question is a very small explosive of the `` we can see you , dipshit '' type . 
  it 's incapable of harming a submarine . 
  tourism is n't ok anymore ? 
  i 'd say it 's gone too real in the point where you haul karhu back to finland . 
  or any other bulk lager that 's readily available here . 
  i 'll just leave this picture of [ positively thrilled kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen ] ( https://desdirodeabike.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/411354_4202295937345_2001044111_o.jpg ) here to prove you wrong . 
  bet you feel pretty stupid now , huh !, 
  i just remember ahonen as the [ cheery ] ( http://img.yle.fi/urheilu/hiihtolajit/makihyppy/article6949992.ece/alternates/w960/ahonen+janne011113.jpg ) one . 
   i can see the pant information i ca n't ; not enough pixels . 
  : (  nobody imports nobelaner do not underestimate ** the thirst ** !, 
  ( although seriously , you 're right . ), 
  well you ca n't really tell if those are imported or not . 
   make it your own why not just make your own ? 
  it 's not difficult . 
  my grandpa made one for about 2 k $ . 
  ferry line had a special deal for march .
