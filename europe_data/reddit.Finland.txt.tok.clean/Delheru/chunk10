  things just got pretty lame for russia , because that aerial battle is something they are unlikely to win , and one which will incur losses they will have a hard time recovering from . 
  i do n't think they really want that . 
  they know that they have a few options now : fight , which gives then the expected result of humiliation and devastating material loss ( with the evac plan of global annihilation ) and a small chance of a victory they would n't really know what to do with . 
  what would they do if they beat nato forces ? 
  march in to eastern europe ? 
  and hold it with what , exactly ? 
  i do n't think there 's any real chance of a war except perhaps in the air , and even that 'll be symbolic and more a test of nato capabilities than a real war . 
  in case nato starts losing it , i suppose they 'd take ukraine and sit on it , but i do n't think anyone really sees that as a possibility . 
  estonia in particular is far closer to the center of russian power than chechnya ever was . 
  granted lithuania et al are quite a bit trickier especially after they lose the air . 
  frankly i 'd imagine an actual war would go something like this : 1 . 
  russia , in a surprising move grabs something . 
  lets say the baltics . 
  now it starts posing as the most peaceful bastard anywhere to make the west seem like the aggressors . 
  there 's a major aerial battle on top of the baltics . 
  interesting to see whether for example finland will host airplanes ( i 'd say it 's quite likely to be honest , lord knows i 'd fucking vote for it ) . 
  this , in many ways , ** is ** the war . 
  russia will try to use numbers in the first battles to win . 
  however , if it begins to lose it 'll quickly quit using air assets - it does n't want to suffer catastrophic losses which might trigger all sorts of problems . 
  so max 20 % of russian air force can be allowed to be hurt . 
  ok , 20 % of air force down . 
  now putin will see how well modern anti-aircraft deals with usaf . 
  if this is still very one sided , russia will simply declare a unilateral withdrawal and behave as if nothing ever happened . 
  if it 's tougher , we 'd have to see it out ( though the end would probably look very similar ) i seriously doubt it 'd ever get to ground battles . 
  it 'd just be silly and the loss of lives would be pointless . 
  i was n't saying the west would have genuine trouble . 
  i am , however , saying that quantity has a quality of its own as well , and hiding from air power particularly while on the defensive in europe 's forests is not the hardest thing ever ( especially if you have good air defense ) . 
  an attacking russian force would be torn to bits with very limited losses by a prepared western force of equal ( or as it may be these days , greater in numbers ) strength . 
  however , if russia just rolls in to the baltics or something and digs in while playing all peaceful , the situation would be very different and much more difficult . 
  air power has its limits , and i would find flying an a-10 against dug in forces terrifying as all hell . 
  ( source : the finnish military has done a lot of thinking and has a lot of practical experience on how to cause tons of damage even when the opposition rules the skies ), 
  i 'd say one of the greatest chances of a truly epic war would involve china trying to pull a crimea with siberia . 
  if there 's one thing china could * really * use it 's siberia . 
  the west is best left alone as a customer - there 's nothing to be really gained from fighting the west except perhaps prestige , and even the chinese are n't ** that ** prestige driven . 
  yeah . 
  perhaps in the desert you can exercise your technological superiority to the max ( sit at 3km , shoot , withdraw keeping your distance and constantly shooting until you have to resupply ) , but anywhere else you 'll have some problems . 
  if for no other reason then because a m1a2 only carries 42 rounds . 
  lets say that 50 % miss or are `` finishing blows '' on wounded tanks . 
  that 's 21 tanks destroyed . 
  great , but now what ? 
  tigers were to shermans what m1a2s or modern leopards are to t-72s . 
  did n't save the germans from the sheer number of shermans ( admittedly , air power was a bigger problem , and if it had been only a tank struggle , the germans would have probably thrown the western allies back in the atlantic ) . 
  the issue is that these sorts of things are momentous decisions and especially getting thrown in to it it 's very hard to be supremely decisive . 
  hitler had that going for him - he could blow smoke while going in very hard and he could run risks that none in a democracy would have dared run . 
  poland was over very , very quickly . 
  significantly faster than anyone expected ( hence coining the term blitzkrieg after all ... see how long austria took with serbia in ww1 , and the size difference there was considerably greater than between germany and poland ) . 
  poland ? 
  do n't really remember . 
  france got itself occupied and seriously damaged and uk got itself bombed very severely because they came to defend poland . 
  hitler never really had any designs on western europe except to neutralize it as a force that could threaten him . 
  all he wanted a little bit of lebensraum in a germany that reached from frankfurt to vladivostok . 
   my personal prediction is that the crimea will be part of russia from now on ( russia needs the shipyards there ) - the rest of the ukraine may join the eu eventually . 
  the interesting and perhaps not ideal side effect from the perspective of russia of the annexation is that it 's permanently changing the demographics of ukraine proper , reducing the pro-russian vote even further ( not that crimea is very populous with its 2 million inhabitants ) . 
  never mind the fact that now ukraine proper is decidedly pissed at russia . 
  so from a cold geopolitical standpoint , this might turn out to be a win for the eu . 
  dunno , the uk and france would retain considerable freedom to maneuver . 
  the one thing they could not do really well is fight in a massive land war against an extremely powerful adversary . 
  considering germany , nordics , eastern europe et al are on your side anyway , i 'm a little unclear where you 'd want the freedom to fight a major land war anyway ? 
  the only nations that would be too much to handle for a eu navy ( uk/french ) + marines with a 100bn eur budget are countries that uk/france would n't be able to deal with alone even if they did keep around major armored divisions ( because the adversaries they 'd need those for are the likes of china , usa and india ) . 
  i always wondered if we should split the duties a bit to deal with the language barriers still being a thing ( not that english is n't fairly universally spoken , but perhaps not in all ranks ) . 
  leave the navy to the brits and france ( and tie power projection to this with a force similar to us marines ... we know you guys love that stuff ) but require no real other contributions . 
  defensive military including an air force comparable to usaf is then handled by essentially everyone else with the leadership of germany . 
  not necessarily new markets but i think the membership removed a few commonly used policy crutches ( currency manipulation being a big one ) which might have gotten finnish enterprise focused on actual value creation . 
   so the logical conclusion you draw from our disagreement is that i , obviously , must be very young ? 
  actually i guessed you were american . 
  the binary focus on wealth distribution ( or wealth creation ) is such an american thing , where most europeans seem to strike a more balanced stance ( i 'm personally maybe 60 % wealth creation and 40 % wealth distribution ) . 
   i 'm danish . 
  i live in a functional social democratic nation in which a vast majority view it the same way . 
  i 'm finnish . 
  we got it all pretty much working too , yet there have n't been a lot of great experiences with fully government run things besides the true natural monopolies . 
  we 're again in a position where the government has gotten way too big and needs to be scaled down because ultimately it does not create anything new . 
   governments , as entities consisting of people making decisions , are no more prone to corruption than a corporation . 
  almost 100 % correct , but not quite . 
  i 'd excuse founder run companies from this group as being slightly less corrupt . 
  there 's no difference between a huge corporation ( say , ge ) with faceless shareholders and a huge corporation with faceless voters though , you are absolutely correct about that . 
   the former , however , is easiler held accountable than the latter . 
  is it , really ? 
  depends on the situation . 
  in a natural monopoly , the government one is easiest to hold accountable as both are insanely tough to hold accountable and the government one is marginally easier . 
  however , in any service provision environment , a government operation is far less accountable than a private one . 
  not that the private ones are accountable so much as they are susceptible to customer ill will . 
  i have seen government operations survive being universally reviled . 
  ( then again , i live in the us now , and the worst of both worlds - the private monopoly - gives private corporations like twc and comcast the possibility to also survive despite being universally reviled )  i 'm not - as you seem to think - arguing for a planned economy . 
  i 'm just trying to dispel the misunderstanding that only a privately owned company can generate a profit . 
  yes , but you 're making your case to a person ( ukrainian op ) that has dealt with far worse governments than we have which have shown little to no responsiveness to the citizenry ... and of course true corruption requires the government bringing in ( accidentally ) friend/family owned private businesses to suck on the teat that gives on giving . 
  under such circumstances , a weak government is obviously far preferred to a strong government . 
  even if huge wealth spikes might occur , at least they wo n't all be in automatic agreement ( having come up through the same patrimony system ) and even this does not seem to have been happening - observe the salary rises he refers . 
  are you from the us or really young ? 
  you do n't really seem to have encountered functioning social democracy because what you 're spouting is fairly silly and supported by very few in the nordic countries for example . 
  ( the points being : you think all parties ca n't share goals and you think government owned companies are workable for wealth creation )  you 're entitled to your opinions but do n't think that only private companies can make money . 
  nationalized companies make money just as easily . 
  these become stratified and part of the government bureaucracy very easily . 
  sometimes they can go and function well for long periods under exceptional leadership , but typically they have salary caps etc imposed on them and the management starts gaming benefits and empire building ( because often government job salaries are linked to number of reports or other similarly arbitrary bureaucratic goal ) and there 's just no easy way out of this mess ( or there is : see fixing us healthcare . . it 's obviously possible , just insanely difficult because of the vested interests ) . 
  no complex systems should be run by the government , because the chances of corruption just plain explode . 
  this is ** very ** different from saying the government ca n't channel vast sums of money btw . 
   we ( europeans ) in `` their '' ( sorry for the generalisation ) eyes are taxed to hell . 
  the craziest thing about this ? 
  we moved our operations from uk to us and founders are paying themselves in the $ 80k range in the us ( since , you know , founders still ) . 
  at the end of the day you see ** less ** of the money in boston than you did in the uk ... ( and that 's with health insurance 100 % covered ) . 
  there is something about insurances about letting you leave the hospital right after a surgery .
