  this is a real thing , but at the end of the day from a consumer perspective it is obviously ridiculous . 
  it still seems punitive against people trying to do something big over a long period of time . 
  work 20 years on making fusion work ? 
  yea , we 'll tax you like you had actually had the money for 20 years !, 
  why ? 
  because fuck you , that 's why . 
  seems like a good thing to me . 
  only thing i 'd be more ok with spending billions on than the space agency is energy research , which i hope would be spending tens if not 100 + billion on high tech jobs and other expenses . 
  while i agree with him on some stuff , i seriously think he 's missing a very big deal in assuming that technological change is not significant and just part of the background noise . 
   piketty would impose an annual graduated tax on stocks and bonds , property and other assets that are customarily not taxed until they are sold . 
  he leaves open the rate and formula for distributing revenues . 
  this , however , is a ** terrible ** idea . 
  ( entrepreneur here with millions in theoretical money , but no cash whatsoever ) it would either severely hurt entrepreneurship or move vast sums from the pockets of entrepreneurs to those that finance them , meaning more wins for capital and less for the people doing things . 
  no finland until 1918 . 
  we are good at chemistry though - just look at all the summer olympic gold we got back when . 
  norway kind of failing the nordic countries here . 
  well they 're all european , even if some by disgruntled colonists . 
  spaniards, 
  of course i would , because i 'd trust them to think that anyone putting troops in there would be mad , and then drive should really fucking fast at the narrowest point . 
  it 's rather how blitzkrieg often worked ( for example the invasion of norway was ridiculously ballsy ) . 
  and realistically speaking they would totally pull it off . 
  the brits would try to evacuate people , would waffle over the ridiculous economic damage of breaching the dams etc etc. 
  you only need them talking for 2 days and you 're in england ... also one would wonder about how many civilians lived there . 
  would the uk really hit those dams if 2 million brits and 1 million dutch people lived down there ? 
  sure , why the fuck not , it 's just a few million more . 
  done in 1930 ? 
  seems more like a.k.a lets make uk open to blitzkrieg project . 
  stockpile the potatoes first, 
  i do n't think germany as part of the eu would necessarily be as pacifist as it is acting as a nation state . 
  after all , if the eu decides to send troops , it 's not german troops - it 's international troops . 
  this wo n't * really * work as long as the units do n't get mixed , which brings forth the language problem . 
  perhaps a requirement for the main forces of eu would be english fluency ( except the french will moan about that ) . 
  i think yugoslavia suffered from the bystander effect . 
  the eu having the only real army around would remove that excuse - you ca n't just sit around and wait for someone else to do something . 
  it 's either us bust in our near abroad , and ** will ** make people think about things very differently . 
  i think it has to do with the nature of the war . 
  falklands ? 
  i think a fair number of european countries might be willing to pitch in if uk really needed help - it 's just such a blatant grab for purely internal reasons that argentina deserves the bitch slap it 'd get ( also : it 's practically guaranteed not to be a quagmire - the 3 people on the islands that want to be part of argentina would not make a multi-year insurgency ) . 
  and of course if anyone actually attacked an eu nation , i 'm sure everyone would be up for it . 
  as a finn i ca n't really see how someone attacking france would not have bad things in mind for me as well . 
  or romania for that matter . 
  the fact that the people that attack those states ** know ** we 're in the eu together makes their hostile intentions ( or certainly no respect , love or willingness to talk ) towards finland as well perfectly clear . 
  mali and libya are trickier , but i suspect that the consensus would have been influenced by the knowledge that they * actually have the power * ( and hence the fucking responsibility ) for the decision . 
  whether we 'd have gone in as eu is a good question , but i suspect we 'd have made the right decision . 
  you do realize people from newcastle and cardiff died for centuries mainly to the benefit of se england ( and secondarily manchester , birmingham and liverpool ) . 
  what 's so different about an estonian dying to teach argentina a lesson near the falklands ? 
  it 's all perceptions . 
   smoking pot does n't do any harm , so i do n't see the reason why it should be illegal . 
  nor does having sex for whatever you like . 
   prostitution on the other hand can be very harmful - there are many prostitutes who are coerced into their profession and there are people who can be forced in to addiction to drugs which would otherwise be relatively harmless . 
  most genuine `` slaves '' found in the west do housework rather than prostitution one might add , so should cleaning services be banned as well ? 
  clearly in-house maids are a risk group . 
   it can be a dangerous profession and i think only very few would keep doing it if they had any other option it is an insanely well paying profession , and while sure , people would prefer to do other things ** all other things being equal ** , i assure you that would apply to practically every investment banker and hedge fund manager out there . 
  it 's just that you can make * so much money * if you do things right . 
   the only people who profit from prostitution are the pimps and johns , so i do n't really understand how so many people here can be in favor of it . 
  that 's like saying the only people that benefit from investment banking are the people that own investment banks . 
  i assure you investment banking is a terrible goddamn job , but i really do n't think you need to pity said investment bankers that much - they knew what they were getting in to * and * the money is fantastic . 
  if the prostitutes themselves are n't making enough money , why is that a problem with prostitution as a concept ? 
  you might as well use wal-mart to prove that retail is immoral . 
   btw , i am talking about street workers and prostitutes from brothels only , i think it 's a very different matter if you 're a high-end escort or offer your service on a private basis with no connection to the red-light district i can tell , yet you seem keen to make blanket rules that apply to both . 
  the high end escorts serve the market that brings the huge $ $ $ to the table , meaning that as long as they are n't served , it 'll happen illegally if it is n't available legally . 
  so at the very least the high end escorts must be allowed . 
  but then again here 's the problem ... 
  if you 're unemployed that you want a x-box one to keep yourself entertained , how tempting would it be if someone told you that only thing you 'd have to do is to give a blowjob ? 
  once you stop associating any emotion to certain sex acts , they surely are among the easiest jobs in the world . 
  the biggest problems frankly still come from the stigma attached to it . 
  otherwise maybe some big chain would jump in to the space and they 'd basically squeeze the pimps out in no time flat . 
  except none wants to because they might suffer brand damage elsewhere , mostly because of people like yourself . 
  so in my opinion we either have to be totally ok with it , or totally against it , and i much prefer to err on the side of accepting things rather than banning them, 
   according to you it would be a waste of time and money to fight human trafficking at all because they would just find some way around it by trafficking them to another country . 
  human trafficking gets fought because it directly harms people and hence must be a crime . 
  you 've admitted that prostitution itself is not the problem here , but controlling it would be used to target another problem . 
  now as the morality is blurred , we should look at results . 
  and those do n't look promising . 
   in europe those organised gangs have the biggest markets for prostitutes and sex slaves . 
  i am convinced that if there 's less demand in europe they 'll force less women into prostitution because it just would n't be worth it anymore . 
  even if it wo n't be avoidable to stop human trafficking completely it should be necessary to make it as hard as possible for them . 
  mandatory drug testing would also reduce the need for drugs . 
  even if you 're pro-marihuana or , hell , pro - all drugs , according to your logic i should jump behind the mandatory drug testing because it hurts organized crime ? 
  not really convinced ... 
  the issue is that you are pushing the problem around and not really helping anyone . 
  let 's say i am a criminal in the ukraine and i have access 20 incredibly beautiful women . 
  now i want to sell my good for the best profit i can . 
  of * course * a legal country will pull me in because the profits will be great and risks low . 
  if a few countries make it harder to operate , it is not as if i will stop trying . 
  worst cade scenario i will simply keep them entertaining my thugs in ukraine . 
  i just can not see a scenario where these women would be better off with all of eu banned to them . 
  hell , they would probably get sent to dubai or something to run the risk of arrest there ... yay ? 
  you are probably hurting both the prostitutes and their pimps ( and the potential customer base ) . 
  now i would consider this a net loss . 
  admittedly the problem is not in your back yard anymore , and i guess that is good enough for some . 
  as someone that spent a lot of time in the south east ... no thanks , i think they 'd go with london ( i certainly would prefer to , and oxford does n't really feel it shares a lot with newcastle to be honest ) . 
  what the hell finland - we 're supposed to top charts like this . 
  maybe i already did , and that 's why there 's a wine shortage ? 
  you jest to a degree , but actually if there 's a fantastic year of wine , it might be a fantastic investment . 
  if we had another 1985 type year ( in france ) and you had to throw a billion at a single investment , spending all of that on the nicest wines that are winning awards that year would be a pretty decent strategy . 
  reasonable bet that you 'll have gained 50 % or more in 5 years and 100 % + in 10 . 
  not a bad investment at all . 
  good news for the spanish , french and italian economies . 
  excellent .
