  `` mass '' casualty ? 
  i say this as someone who lives in boston - was n't much of a terror strike , and nobody is fucking terrorized by it . 
  very proud of the city 's attitude toward the whole thing . 
  yeah . 
  i can easily imagine the combined parents + genes ( surely hard to distinguish in most studies ) come through as 70 % or even more . 
  the founder of the party was saying some crazy shit in them as i understand . 
  yes , but there are people who can vote who were n't there for that , and probably find it pretty ... well ... gross . 
  considering that group is also the greens main demographic , that just is n't very good . 
  and that group also has had more hypocrisy than they can stomach , and these greens were the first to attack pedophile priests . 
  meh , i 'd be very put off . 
  i was just reading about some rather awkward pro-pedophilia texts from the early greens . 
  not german myself , but i can see how that might make one less keen to vote for them ( if that is indeed a topic right now ) . 
   allow the woman her dignity !, 
  we ca n't have varying standards of self-imposed dignity . 
  this does n't make any sense . 
  i think religion is madness to begin with , but i guess you could argue to me that this * one * thing that 's written in the holy book would be nice to cater to - after all , huge monotheisms do n't pop up very often so it 's not like there 'd be a terrible feature creep to this . 
  however , that does n't apply here , does it . 
  this does * not * come from the qu ` ran . 
  if it did , then perhaps it 'd fly ( i 'd dislike it , but i would n't be worried about millions of things drifting from fantasyland to where the rest of us live ) , but it does n't , and hence it 's just a cultural norm and our legal system should * completely and utterly * ignore those . 
  the law should be blind , and so should the system enforcing it . 
  yes . 
  but there is always creep in this , as fisa is clearly showing . 
  and because of such creep it is important to shut down anything which does pass the bar properly . 
  this is one of those cases . 
  what 's wrong in boston ? 
  ( i happen to live here right now , and based on what i 'm seeing , the economy is nearly booming , particularly in robotics and healthcare ), 
  i think you guys are talking past each other a bit . 
  in the us the `` american style '' is mostly understood as executive-judicial-legislative . 
  the only real debate here is whether the executive should be separate from legislative or not . 
  i suspect that in a country the size of eu-27 , we 'd almost certainly find ourselves wanting to elect the executive . 
  why ? 
  because the `` coalition of right wing parties '' deciding the prime minister would feel way too distant to everyone . 
  oh , they selected some austrian dude to be the prime minister i 've never heard of . 
  yay ? 
  this would undermine faith in the system very , very quickly . 
  for a federal system i think the us one works very sensibly . 
  however , the devil is in the details . 
  senators ** must not ** be directly elected . 
  i would also keep the executive branch the fuck away from the judicial branch , and possibly bring in the heads of states ( ie us governors ) in on those discussions while keeping the president in the dark . 
  also the elections must not be first past the post , as that is probably the greatest reason for the rubbish seen in the us ( along with gerrymandering , which is why i think the eu would have to let open source computer algorithms decide the electoral boundaries ) . 
  single transferable vote maybe ? 
  so the overall us structure seems fine . 
  worse than when it originally started ( and senators were picked by state assemblies ) and with a needlessly powerful executive branch , but otherwise fine . 
  it 's the gerrymandering and the first-past-the-post that are the problems . 
  i do not see that much difference between wearing a burka or a ss uniform , except that the former reflects more on the family than the wearer herself ( though to be fair , so might the latter ) . 
  both represent irrational and dangerous totalitarianism and ate essentially a way of wearing your political beliefs ( in the original meaning ) on your sleeve . 
  that being said i would not ban either , but i have no interest in dealing with people subscribing and advertising such madness . 
  that being said , i do understand more subtle approaches to chasing these obscenities from the public sphere are available and should be pursued . 
  because it is essential the public can see justice done , and hiding justice in backrooms is wrong . 
  or are you ok with the fisa secret courts ? 
  in those , everyone 's sensitivities are protected . 
  i for one do not want to see such a fundamental part of our justice compromised for anything short of a genuine threat to our existence . 
  yeah the whole thing is quite retarded . 
  if guardian had some genuinely dangerous stuff that uk should not share ( sources of information abroad , for example ) , i 'm sure the government could have just asked for it . 
  guardian has all the incentives to yield that sort of information to the government for reasons ranging from nationalist ( why fry your own spies ? ), 
  to humanitarian ( people might get killed ) and populist ( we 're helping the government except we wo n't help it against its own people ) . 
  the fact they did n't do this implies either incredible incompetence * or * there really is n't any such material . 
   maybe it is that countries with a colonial history might have a different perspective about the consequences of thinking their culture is superior to others . 
  perhaps . 
  on the other hand they have a wider base to compare themselves generally to . 
  ask a frenchman to compare french culture to `` other '' cultures and algerian muslim will sneak in quickly . 
  same with pakistanis/indians in the uk and turks in germany . 
  ask the question in finland and people will think of sweden and russia as `` immediate vicinity '' . 
   plus how can a person use a metric ? 
  now you 're taking political correctness a little far . 
  i feel no shame in saying that western culture has been and still is the most sophisticated and `` best '' in the world . 
  now within that there are numerous flavours which are harder to compare . 
  and i 'm not saying this as somehow implying the west is inherently superior . 
  far from it . 
  it 's just that we reached modernity first and the inertia is keeping us ahead of the others . 
  i 'd put rule of law ( rather than of men ) , equality in front of law and equality in front of culture ( ie rape might be illegal in india , but ... ) as things that are not debatable . 
  if your country/culture does n't have them , it 's worse than mine . 
  full stop . 
  that being said , they 're becoming more and more standard and are kind of adhered to even in countries where they are n't formally there in a way . 
  like say , china and rule of law ... it 's getting there for the vast majority , but there are people above the law . 
  and of course to have problems in the west where the governments ( particularly in the us ) really dislike not being above the law and are trying to overcome this , effectively undermining the best parts of western culture . 
  i find it far more pointed how dramatic the impact of education is . 
  49 % --  25 % for nationalism in germany once you go to college ? 
  35 % --  15 % for nationalism in france . 
  some of the ones i can also understand . 
  knowing how women are often treated outside the west , as a female my feelings of western cultural superiority would be far more personal than they would as a male . 
  i mean as a man i 'd be fine as a mullah or raj or whatever , but women might not be as lucky . 
  it 's also interesting to try to figure out what people end up comparing themselves to . 
  the question can be understood as : hmm , germany . 
  are we * really * better than the french or danish ? 
  ** or ** hmm , germany . 
  are we * really * better than a country i hit if i throw a dart at a map ? 
  i have to say my questions would be very different to those two questions , and it was n't really qualified which one was being asked . 
  so subtle things like whether the latter question has been recently discussed in local media ( ie a honor killing incident or equivalent ) will have influenced this poll . 
  looking from the outside the two of you are like a married couple . 
  sure , you argue more than anyone , but ultimately you live in the same house and have picked up each others mannerisms , if sometimes to mock them . 
  i did not say huawei was banned , though reading that from between the lines is understandable and i should have been more clear . 
  however , even if i had blatantly made the claim , that would have been a simple error rather than hyperbole . 
  now , us being the most dangerous as a claim could indeed be hyperbole , but i note you dodge that debate with facetiousness . 
  remember - i am not saying the us is the worst , which it clearly is n't - i am saying it is the most * dangerous * . 
  to everyone , especially its own population , who face no other realistic threats that are not planetary in scale . 
   you post is high on hyperbole i 'm curious which part you 'd consider hyperbole . 
  and yes , huawei is n't actually banned , but it is considered a strategic risk and i have no doubt that this has a business impact to a point where cisco and oracle would be unhappy if eu treated them like us government treats huawei . 
  lord knows eu has tons more cause to suspect us companies than us has to suspect chinese companies . 
   it 's hard to take moral arguments seriously when the solution is protectionism and a clear push to pass laws that otherwise would be found in violation of various trade agreements .
