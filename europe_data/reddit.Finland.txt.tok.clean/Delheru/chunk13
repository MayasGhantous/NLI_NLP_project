  us already did it with huawei so it 's not like us can have any room to criticize the move . 
  and is protectionism against an aggressive and leaning-towards-totalitarianism hegemonic power really that terrible ? 
  i mean , i ca n't think of many better things that one * should * protect against . 
  i 'm sorry that your government is the most dangerous force on the planet these days ( not necessarily because it 's malevolent , but because it 's building up enough power that if it ever turns malevolent , none can stop it ) , but it really does need to get stopped using whatever means necessary . 
  with the huawei precedent , pretty sure the trade agreements can be adhered to . 
  that 's why this fight really is international , and germany banning cisco sales would be a small shot fired in the same battle that a restore the fourth gathering in san francisco is part of . 
   eu citizens has to make a stand . 
  yes , but i want to stress how this is ** not ** a stand * against * americans . 
  it 's a stand with americans against the governmental power creep that is happening as a side effect of the information revolution . 
  i 'm the first one to admit that more sophisticated security is necessary in the modern age , but there needs to be a vision for it that does not create a state that is impossible to rebel against ( or even resist ) . 
  that fight was lost before it even begun in non-democratic countries , but now it is the responsibility of the populations of the democracies ( most critically the anglosphere and the eu ) to stop their own governments from taking us all down in to a deep dark place from which there might not be a return . 
  we might not beat the governments easily ourselves , but if we make them fight each other on this topic , they will weaken which might allow internal change to come about . 
   what would banning cisco and oracle achieve ? 
  fairly intense pressure emanating from silicon valley against washington while at the same time creating a precedent that eu would have a very hard time dealing with . 
  if eu intelligence agencies would be doing the same thing ( i 'm sure they are ) ericsson and nokia-siemens might end up banned in the us ... sucks for everyone , and the only way out seems to be the terrifying prospect of not creating a totalitarian surveillance state . 
   i note you 're from finland . 
  trying to prop up nokia siemens networks , perhaps ? 
  i was expecting the main winner to be ericsson actually . 
  and for the record i live in boston ( will be a us citizen soon ) and work in the high tech industry , so i 'd personally be a major potential loser if us businesses suffered . 
  on the other hand if us intelligence services are allowed to run rampant , there 's a huge potential than me and my children lose a hell of a lot more than 10 % of our business . 
   while selling the same products ? 
  i ca n't see cisco releasing different software releases for the eu and us , with the eu version having the hypothetical nsa backdoor taken out . 
  like i said , it 'd be an operational nightmare to basically open up the code to eu review on some level to check for back doors . 
  keeping two `` parallel '' products would be so blindingly obvious to anyone as well , never mind the hassle inside these companies . 
   ( nb : i 'm an employee of one of the companies in this comment ) sorry that you 'd be easy to make an example of . 
  while i was still in finland our company used both cisco and oracle products and were happy with both . 
  however , it 's not like those companies do n't have replacements . 
  trying to ban microsoft , facebook and google in europe would be just bloody insane and completely hopeless , so one has to pick meaningful targets from the b2b world where there 's some hope of success . 
  like in any system , the incentives are what matters . 
  the trouble is that for us government and particularly the intelligence apparatus , it is clear that the incentives are ** for ** terrorism and not for the reduction of it . 
  to say this is a problem would be mild . 
   realistically , i do n't think much can be done in the short term . 
  some really stinging operations can certainly be done . 
  what eu ** can ** hit is us b2b companies . 
  b2c like google is difficult , though threatening noises should be made in that way too ( even if that 's more bark than bite ) . 
  however , banning cisco and oracle from selling to the eu would be an insane blow to those companies while at the same time being perhaps a pain in the ass to some eu companies , but hardly anything fatal ( plenty of replacements and it 's all behind the scenes ) . 
  the only way cisco and oracle could keep the business is by spinning off their eu operations and making them fully independent . 
  the pain in the ass operationally on their end would make a 2 by 4 feel pleasant . 
  it would also send a powerful signal that us government would have an insanely difficult time explaining its way through . 
  still , the fundamental problem here is that yes , there is a `` us vs. the world '' balance of power here , but more fundamentally it 's a `` people vs. government '' balance of power . 
  now does n't that create a troublesome dichotomy for governments around the world ? 
  lose 50 % of my power to the us , but triple it internally ? 
  that 's 150 % and sounds like a win to me !, 
  there 's a fantastic quote in the comments : '' * of all tyrannies , a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive . 
  it would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies . 
  the robber baron 's cruelty may sometimes sleep , his cupidity may at some point be satiated ; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience * . '', 
   you lost me . 
  are you saying that people who buy uk tabloids abroad are more likely to visit the uk ? 
  i 'm saying that they are already sending money to the uk the instant they buy those tabloids . 
  i have no data to back this one up , but intuitively if we take two groups of , say , chinese or americans . 
  one group has never touched a uk tabloid , the other group is defined by the fact that they have . 
  do you think these two groups have similar france/uk visit ratios when going to europe ? 
  * surely * the tabloid group is more interested in the uk than the group that never touched the tabloids . 
   and that they are enough to be significant for the economy ? 
  the tabloids themselves are already quite significant if we 're talking on the scale of the royal spending ( so tens to hundreds of millions , not billions to tens of billions ) . 
  every traveller to the uk brings about 600 gbp ( http://www.visitbritain.org/insightsandstatistics/inboundtourismfacts/ ) , so it does n't take too many to start making an impact . 
  if even one in 50 visitors to the uk has been influenced by the tabloids ( say , 10 % of that one-in-50 group would have gone to france or italy were it not for the tabloids ) we 're looking at 0.2 % of the total tourism of the uk . 
  that - according to the link i just had there - amounts to slightly shy of 40 million gbp . 
  nothing to sneeze at . 
   do tabloids promote british culture , which is fundamentally different than us culture ? 
  the royal family does . 
  it gets broadcast through tabloids , bbc , books and lord knows what . 
  i would n't say it is * fundamentally * different , but it is different , and that is important . 
  it helps balance the us influence from being quite overwhelming . 
  there is a decided subgroup to who the palace just wo n't be the same without the royals ( see : the people who buy the tabloids ) . 
  the tabloids sales are part of it all , and yes , they do help the uk economy because all of the material is coming from the uk and being consumed globally . 
  surely you do n't think that stuff is being sent out for free ? 
  it helps keep the uk relevant and on top of a significant number of people 's heads . 
  oh sure , significant chunks of the global population appreciate uk for its great culture , top universities etc. 
  but there 's a whole different segment of population that laps up the tabloids and there is limited overlap . 
  uk is globally the only real cultural exporter that realistically competed with the us , and the royal family is - while not a crucial part - certainly significant in that . 
  i like the uk and in many ways thoroughly enjoy that their cultural push is there to balance out the us at least to some degree . 
  lord knows there are tons of uk ( to be honest , england and to a lesser degree scotland ) fans in the us because of all of this . 
  queen , west end , center of finance , sherlock , bbc , harry potter , every damn game of thrones actor and so on and so forth . 
  considering the overwhelming power of us culture , i 'd rather the uk not fuck around with what 's working really well right now . 
  and that means keeping the royals too . 
  it 's a big part of the charm , and lord knows there 's tons of people around buckingham . 
  also the tabloid sales ... ( americans in particular seem very interested in the royal family , though it 's a relatively common passtime among the global population at large ), 
  sounds like my setup . 
  the cynic in me applauds . 
  my friends will live long , but those distant acquaintances that smoke give the pension and healthcare systems a chance of surviving . 
  ie : if i do n't know you and do n't have to interact with you , please smoke . 
   `` but , if you get caught , the fine starts at eighty-eight hundred euros , and they take away your license !, 
  that 's the way europe is . 
  on the surface , it appears to rely on everyone 's self-discipline , but behind it all there are strict laws . '' i also thought that was fairly insightful . 
  there are far more credible theories than these , though they are funny and anecdotal . 
  also , this type of `` decline '' thought tends to stress that the decline started around 1750 or so , whereas most scholars would accept that china was in relative decline against the west from roughly 1162 ( hi genghis ! ), 
  to 1975 or so . 
  the whole thing was kicked off properly by the mongol conquest , but the underlying causes that allowed the mongols to do what they did you could write a book about . 
  and many have , frankly . 
  glasses ? 
  though it is an interesting detail for sure , but knowing the speculated main causes behind the start of the decline around 1100-1150 , not sure what help the glasses would have been . 
   saying that the us is `` really bloody cheap '' ca n't possibly hold up to scrutiny . 
  i saw 3 bedroom places with 2 car garages and a pool going for less than $ 100k in phoenix around 2009 . 
  oh yea , built in 2005 or so as well , so not like these places were falling apart . 
  i might be picking all the wrong places to live , but helsinki , finland and oxford , uk have certainly both been places where you might maybe , just maybe , get a garage for that sort of money . 
   sadly it 's always the uk meps bitching about how it 's `` not that bad '' and the european parliament is overreacting . 
  well yes , but they do n't do that to help the us really . 
  the brits have always been fantastic at espionage , and almost certainly are better at it than the us even to this day ( only advantage us has is huge budgets and the toys they get out of that ) . 
  france has similar inclinations .
