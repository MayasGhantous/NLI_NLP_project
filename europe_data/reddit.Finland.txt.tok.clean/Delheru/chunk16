  particularly in multiethnic societies like , say , london , it is n't like you 're getting shunned by the locals - a huge chunk of the locals are n't `` local '' anyway . 
  i can see how the need might be greater in a society where the mainstream population might shun you ( finland , unfortunately , might be a good example of this ) . 
  the french speak english just fine but seem to like huddling together !, 
  edit : and finns do n't huddle together because there are seldom enough finns anywhere . 
  and we do n't really like each other . 
  of course not , but i have n't seen particularly good statistics on how religious the new nominally muslim migrants are either ( arabs almost certainly always show it , but i sure as hell would make a show of adhering to anything that placed me at the top of a hierarchy too ) . 
  nice to see many of the eastern european countries doing so well . 
  particularly proud of estonia of course . 
  22 years from soviet union and beating many extremely advanced countries . 
  well if poles are the most common thing , surely the caliphate thing is in the past , and slavery to the vatican will be in the headlines any day now ... surely ? 
  it 's interesting how well the polish in particular blend in . 
  zero interest in forming ghettoes there , which is really refreshing to see . 
  yea , these guys do not seem popular at all with the locals . 
  with downright hostility from the locals instead of tacit approval ( iraq ) or even active approval ( southern afghanistan ) , an insurgency is practically impossible . 
  sure , they can hide in the desert and strike from there , but that 's not such a great idea against a modern nation with ir equipped drones . 
  if i had to fight an insurgency anywhere , a country in/bordering the sahara where the cities are hostile to the insurgents strikes me as the perfect place . 
  chelsea , newcastle , new york city , alabama and san francisco are pretty much the same thing , yes . 
  extinction is too strong . 
  i think they are heading towards `` hebrewization '' . 
  they 'll never be extinct , but they might get a bit secondary in nature compared to the lingua franca . 
  as an expat finn this is pretty much the reality i live with . 
  finnish is very interesting and cool to talk with other finns in . 
  i also teach it to my children because i feel that knowing two languages from two different language families does awesome things to your cognitive abilities . 
  do i think finnish as a language has a thriving future ? 
  of course not . 
  do i think it 'll die ? 
  i find that similarly unlikely . 
  yeah but there are tons of `` immigrants '' in the uk that are more like ex-pats . 
  these are people from hellholes like switzerland , usa , france and finland ( in my case ) . 
  no shit we work . 
  i bet we make tons more money than the average brit too . 
  wonder what the numbers look like if the 1st world ex-pats/immigrants are stripped out . 
  i still suspect they might work more , but it 'd be interesting to see . 
  i also suspect that the 1st generation immigrants from everywhere work like maniacs . 
  the problem is typically in the second generation , who grow up being shunned etc. 
  still , i would encourage the conversation inside islam . 
  this is not a binary game where people who believe in islam ( or any other unsupported belief system ) have to surrender and accept science is always right instantly . 
  any positive movement is to be encouraged - the road to european enlightenment was a really , really long one too . 
  you 're picking a strawman here - none is denying that there 's a percentage out there that are total assholes and racists , but there 's a reason it 's poison for political parties even in anonymous elections : the massive minority disapproves of that sort of thing . 
  the wrong conclusion is to assume that just because people are n't racist they think the borders should be open . 
  it 's even wrong to assume that because people do n't think the borders should n't be open the way they are open now , they should n't be open at all . 
  it 's extremely annoying when everyone tries to polarize the discussion , when the grown up debate is somewhere in the middle . 
  for example in finland the whole immigration debate is quite simple : a ) how do we make sure people are coming here to live and be productive , rather than just leech off the welfare state ( finns being finns find it tremendously unlikely that someone is coming to the country for the wonderful people , cultural depth and the weather ... you 're in it to enhance your lifestyle either via work or welfare ) ? 
  b ) our refugees seem to misbehave . 
  why ? 
  is there something we should be doing to help ? 
  should we stop the troublesome minorities from growing in size until we figure this out ? 
  when i last lived in finland , the only group with any real problems was the rather small group of somali refugees ... and the cold hard fact there was that a lot of that came from the fact that when they arrived in finland originally , finland was like , kkk racist . 
  we 've improved tons , but first impressions must have been quite something for them . 
  can this situation be salvaged from that ? 
  if , how ? 
  if it ca n't be salvaged , what should we do about that ? 
  what should we do if the same case reoccurs with another minority ? 
  we surely should get involved earlier to try and solve it rather than wringing our hands and doing nothing , but * what * ? 
  of course , both of these questions are incredibly hard so it 's much more fun to have a `` you 're a racist '' v. `` you 'd tolerate sharia on your daughter ! '', 
  sort of battle of snide remarks which just makes the majority of the population sigh . 
  what churchill said of united states is pretty much true about real democracies in general : it 'll do the right thing after having tried every other alternative . 
  europe 's fundamentals are extremely strong still , and it 's fairly obvious in the modern world our nation states are n't big enough to deal with global powers like us and china ( and later on , probably india ) . 
  unity or switzerland style irrelevance are the choices at hand . 
  i think you 're misunderstanding it too . 
  or rather , you 're using it in a more limited spectrum than others . 
  to me , freedom of speech ( like freedom in general ) is first of all an abstract concept that i consider important and adhere to . 
  i 'm sure we could get an american in here to make a very valid and snide remark about how europeans think that it is something the government gives you ( rather than something the government is forbidden from taking away ) . 
  just because the government is n't telling me something does n't mean i stop considering it valuable . 
  i would n't go that far . 
  i think there are 3 or 4 layers to their support . 
  ** layer 1 ** : the actual loud mouth racists who might actually hate a number of minorities what sensible people consider insane levels of passion ( hell , the hate on a varied group is insane to begin with ) . 
  these are the people posting the craziest shit on the internet . 
  ** layer 2 ** : people who are silent supporters of cultural homogeneity . 
  these people tend to be older and white and just disapprove of anything messing with the great culture of the west , as if it was made of fucking paper . 
  it 's done so well because it ** is ** good , but it 's good exactly because it is n't afraid to be fucking challenged . 
  by trying to defend it with violence or proxies to violence , you 're effectively defiling it . 
  my father for example might be considered a part of this group - he does n't really have anything against minorities , but he does disapprove the hell out of a number of them being in finland ( while considering it a low priority issue ) ** layer 3 ** : this is the most significant group . 
  this is the roughly 30-70 % of population that is a little apprehensive of certain minorities . 
  not hateful or anything , but apprehensive . 
  often younger people who are n't necessarily racist , but who 've been in 2-3 violent situations in their whole lives , of which somehow magically 2 were with minorities representing 1.5 % of the national population . 
  they know people from said minorities they get along with great and can respect for their intellectual abilities , but are also aware that a lot of the crime stats are worrying . 
  the cause of this is unclear , but that 's a good reason for looking in to it , as it 'd have a reasonable shot at clearing the air . 
  as long as even looking in to the crime stats is considered racism , it 's impossible to disprove the `` group x is inherently violent '' hypothesis . 
  this group does n't really know what to think and tries to play judge by silently supporting both suppression of overt racism and overt political correctness - something you can see at play in / r/europe ( i would consider myself a member of this group ) . 
  the amusing ( ? ), 
  thing is that islamic fundamentalism works in a very similar way , with the layer 1 being tiny ( 0-2 % of the population or whatever ) and even layer 2 being totally insufficient to actually hide in for very long ( up to 15-20 % ... kind of what the more or less openly racist parties in europe can pull in ) . 
  however , layer 3 is ambivalent because they dislike letting the opposite viewpoint ( in islamic case : usa is a beacon of hope in the world ! ), 
  dominate , because the opposing viewpoint does n't really deal with reality very well . 
  oh , it could in theory because it does make sense ( usa * is * a super advanced democracy with some of the finest achievements mankind has ever achieved under its belt , both in terms of human well being and humanitarian activity . 
  all cultures * do * have value and races mean nothing ) , but reality feels a little more complex ... 
   please whine more about the 10,000 somali refugees moving to sweden . 
  very swedish of you . 
  the amusing thing is that your countrymen ( and probably you to a degree as well ) still have `` ways '' of airing your cultural superiority , because this death-of-conversation attitude will prevent actual debate . 
  i was in petra , jordan , a year or two ago and almost had to deal with a situation . 
  a russian girl i was with ended up talking with some sort of local guide who was hiking the same way with us . 
  he ended up explaining how he had lived 3 years in sweden and fucking ** hated ** swedes and would beat the shit out of one if he ever encountered one . 
  the whole situation was quite interesting for a number of reasons : ** a ** ) the logic of why he hated swedes . 
  apparently he felt completely shut out while in sweden , and that while the people there tolerated him , the condescension level was intolerable and that none * really * thought he was good for anything beyond sweeping the floor or driving a taxi , while at the same time convincing themselves they were n't racist because grads from the top universities ( of any race ) could land great jobs . 
  it 's just that if you only had a high school degree , a swede could make ceo , a palestinian could sweep the floors . 
  ** b ** ) i was surprised that i ended up talking with him making the clear point that while i sympathized , i did n't approve even a little of his plans of attacking a random swede , and that for all intents and purposes he could consider me ( with roughly 20cm and 15kg of mainly muscle over him ) a swede . 
  he did not end up attacking me , though it seriously felt for a moment that he might . 
  brother and sister people indeed . 
  the main point i 'm wanting to make is that you can kill the conversation and hide the racism under covers , but that is n't really the best solution as it only drives the problem underground . 
  oh , it 's probably a good solution in a place where the minority already ** is ** there ( us blacks are the most obvious case of this ) and even a bad solution is better than no solution , but that does n't change the fact that it 's not an ideal solution .
