  pretty easy to deny even . 
  oh , the russians would know ( the uncanny accuracy would be a hint ) , but they 're the ones that are making `` plausible deniability '' a theme . 
  i really hope you will . 
  yea the heavy weapons are very difficult to hide on the open fields of ukraine , and the ukrainians have plenty of artillery ( that does not need terribly high morale troops to operate ) . 
  could be very painful to the invading troops . 
  sweet , good going ukraine . 
  i wonder if the americans are providing artillery coordinates via satellites ? 
  it seems like the least we could be doing . 
  exact coordinates every time russian artillery stops driving around would get great results . 
  this can create some wild cities though . 
  the pearl river delta megacity would be around 100m if you did to edge of concrete . 
  then again it probably deserves the title , but the water in the area makes it quite clearly splittable to multiple cities . 
  i love the curiously informal `` time to scoot '', 
   but that country would get territories from existing countries mainly from syria and iraq , and at this point i think we have to put quotation marks around `` countries '' . 
  i 'm not sure it would really increase tensions that much . 
  lord knows the situation inside syria and northern & western iraq ca n't possibly get much worse . 
  at least now we might fence off a huge chunk of that , and ( on a rather more cynical note ) we can form a blender that islamic radicals could throw themselves against in a well armed and western oriented kurdistan . 
   turkey will never let this happen . 
  there is a significant kurdish minority in turkey and they would try to join if there was an existing kurd state . 
  this has been the only thing blocking kurdistan forming ever since saddam was toppled . 
  now is is changing the calculations a bit . 
  also , an existing kurdistan would allow the turks to deal with a government which is always helpful . 
  lord knows the turks will have even less love for is which , if successful , would obviously come for turkey at some point ( probably not via conventional warfare as they 'd get their faces smashed in , but with terror ) , it being a muslim country not part of the caliphate and all . 
   the last thing they need there is yet another country . 
  what 's wrong with another country ? 
  clearly iraq in particular is n't exactly viable . 
  many of the smaller countries in the region are the most reasonable ones . 
  surely most people would agree that iraq , iran and saudi-arabia are the most troubled ones , with syria next . 
  funny thing , those are the 4 biggest countries in the region ( with turkey and egypt being right next to them ) . 
   what do you think turkey will say when the kurds establish their state ? 
  `` i guess it 's better than the is ''  it 's going to be another gaza . 
  how ? 
  it 's not exactly surrounded by turkey , and since is has oil , it 's not like the west ( or china ) will in any way shape or form support actual embargoes . 
  yea , but safety in numbers has made for strange bedfellows before . 
  if the iraqi kurds get properly equipped and are able to offer protection to the syrian kurds , i suspect they might take it . 
  if i was there ( as a father ) , i certainly would deal with some political uncertainty . 
  not like it would be worse than syria right now . 
  i think the kurds might play this out well . 
  the last 40 years have given great examples on how to play the world like a fiddle if you are n't too fanatical to see it . 
  what do the kurds want now ? 
  they must want an independent state - there just does n't seem much else to it . 
  what they also must want is friendly enough neighbors that they can export their oil and in general get themselves going . 
  this puts some interesting requirements on them : a ) they ** must ** have western backing . 
  this simply wo n't work unless eu and the us recognize the new kurdistan . 
  to this end they have to play nice and play nice long term . 
  b ) with syria in shambles and iran still something of a pariah in western eyes , the oil has to flow either through iraq or turkey . 
  turkey has to be mollified by us , eu and global public opinion . 
  iraq has to avoid the grasp of is and its ilk or it becomes hopeless for the kurds . 
  all in all , the rational roads ( where kurdistan survives as a nation ) lead to very good outcomes for the west because it all depends on western approval - public potentially more than governmental . 
  well it frankly does not look like the map of the middle east in 2025 will include iraq and/or syria with its current borders . 
  as such , i do n't see why the syrian kurds would not simply join the iraqi kurdistan and form a new state . 
  it seems highly likely and in such a scenario the escape of weapons seems far less likely . 
  well they do n't have many tools to discipline when countries break laws . 
  i love free markets , but not more than i dislike war . 
  so i 'll rather take a hit to the free markets than actually see people die . 
  yea but these are pretty much commodities which means that it 's not like that stuff wo n't get sold - you just have to drop prices a bit . 
  which translates to maybe a 10 % drop in price ( if that - not sure how big a consumer russia is ) . 
  if things get really typical , eu will dump its excess produce on africa and the real suffering happens there once again . 
  as someone who has lived abroad a lot , here are the things/experiences that are really popular with foreigners . 
  several of these can be enjoyed in sweden as well ( go figure ) . 
  midsummer night 's in the archipelago with a proper bonfire , sauna through the night etc. 
  it is also a thing i miss a lot myself . 
  midsummer night 's is not mandatory , but a massive bonus . 
  crayfish party on a windy island when the outdoors looks insanely unappealing during an autumn storm . 
  can be simulated pretty well on the islands in front of helsinki . 
  silence . 
  my american wife got this experience near koli middle of the summer . 
  we had rented a cabin and the neighbors were not there . 
  the silence was deafening during the bright night . 
  a bird taking off on the other side of a rather large lake made a huge ruckus etc. 
  particularly urban people find this amazing ( south east englanders often in my case ) 4 . 
  sauna in any context is good if done properly . 
  archipelago/lakes are best , but trying a public one in helsinki will also be food fun . 
  do a mixed gender one if possible for the proper experience . 
  just sell to the swiss . 
  maybe finally the fucking price of salmon there could be less than approx 30eur/kg or whatever ridiculous prices i remember paying ( almost double what it was in munich ) . 
  a lot of these foods are commodities though , which means that you do n't really lose all of those exports . 
  you just drop the prices of said goods a bit in the west as there 'll be oversupply , which means that maybe at worst we 're looking at a 20-25 % drop in prices ( and extra shipping expenses or whatever ) . 
  not the end of the world . 
  much worse on the russian side where prices of foodstuffs will go up . 
  i guess a lot of people over there have been missing soviet times - this should do it . 
  knowing you swedes and danes it must be amusing watching the conflicting impulses of : a ) we are very mature and do n't need to do fancy things just because we can b ) lol it 'd annoy the shit out of them if we 'd make our side look cooler and theirs kinda poor for not being able to match it, 
  that 's certainly true . 
  because issues should be , as default , be handled on the lower levels where things are almost by definition more democratic . 
  this is not a human rights issue ( since we do not go as prison happy as the us ) and as such in many ways is is is closer to bar opening hours than geopolitics . 
  leave it to the countries . 
  as so many countries have vouched , you can perfectly well have both , but i feel countries like finland , sweden , france , germany and ( perhaps particularly ) the uk are kind of humblebragging . 
  in a way our superpower is that we 're constantly critical about ourselves and do n't really get too defensive about it , but we do take action . 
  at the end of the day there 's a pretty unshakeable pride in finns in my experience . 
  we are also , of course , socially really awkward , and praise puts a spotlight on us . 
  while we 're internally delighted by it , the instant reflex is to try and get that fucking spotlight off us ( largely by pointing out flaws etc ) . 
  open bragging has a very bad image in finland after all , and committing it on a national level seems disgraceful . 
  ** finland ** a rather massive superiority complex in most ways . 
  a finnish soldier can still probably take on 10 russians and come out fine . 
  maybe just 2 germans . 
  dunno about swedes , but the only swedes that understand how weapons work would be found selling them to 3rd world dictators anyway . 
  we 're `` of the people '' , and not in that russian serf way . 
  the swedes are puffed up snobs which is annoying about them , being all charismatic and shit . 
  finns are good at things . 
  this is n't really overstated , but it 's very strong .
