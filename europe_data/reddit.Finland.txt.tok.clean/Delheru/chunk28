  my cousin dated a cool muslim guy . 
  big partier and everything in the uk . 
  but at some point his family crashed down on him because he was getting a bit overboard ( full disclosure : he was , drug use etc ) , but holy hell did things convert quickly when he `` found faith '' . 
  in a way i think it was good for him because the drug use definitely was n't healthy , but it made me incredibly happy my cousin had n't married him or something , because the conservativeness as a muslim household went from 0 to about 80 in what felt like a few months . 
  the extended family is a huge risk , unfortunately . 
  if the family is academics from istanbul , then by all means . 
  if it 's farmers from anatolia ... welllllll, 
  they colonized those , not took over ... 
  two continents away from britain is rough . 
  west is north america followed by asia , but asia is neighbor to europe so that ca n't be it . 
  shit , only continents not sharing a border with europe are antarctica , australia and south america , and you said it is n't australia . 
  antarctica seems improbable . 
  somewhere in south america i guess ? 
  except the brits never really took over anything over there despite wielding tremendous influence . 
  maybe jamaica or something . 
  lots of caribbeans in britain . 
  what the fuck do you give a prostitute that makes you have to rape a supremely wealthy country of 2.4 m km ^ 2 ? 
  i mean for real . 
  a battleship fleet ? 
  i dunno what would cost that much around that time . 
  a navy to rival the royal navy seems like the most expensive thing at the time , but i 'm not sure what an underage prostitute would do with one . 
  just the fact that probably the least competent 10 % of the population does n't know foreign languages . 
  it would still be united and diverse , just not the tower of babel, 
  but why would you do this ? 
  trade with and travel in the wider world unreasonably easy for you ? 
  i suppose you would want us to program with french language programming languages too ? 
  ca n't have `` if '' statements after all ? 
  yup . 
  in finland you choose # 1 on 3rd grade , though to be fair in elementary schools the selection is n't always awesome . 
  but i think at mine the 4 available were swedish , german , french and english . 
  english was overwhelmingly the most popular . 
  swedish is mandatory # 2 ( unless you took it as # 1 ) . 
  in junior high you add # 2 and # 3 . 
  the selection tends to be much better here , with things like russian , spanish and these days chinese making their appearance . 
  i personally did n't have a choice about # 2 being swedish , and i picked german as # 3 . 
  throw in spanish in the university to top things off . 
  ( and yes , a lot of people are annoyed at swedish being mandatory . 
  hell , i worked in finland for a swedish company for 3 years and the company language was english . 
  and all our meetings were in english , even though the finns all knew swedish , but less well than english and we definitely did n't want to speak it with the swedes ), 
   of all the things that would prevent joint defense , languages are surely not close to be first on the list . 
  lack of feeling we can work together very well is . 
  so yea , i 'd say language is pretty big . 
  and we can centralize finance , customs , surveillance , anti-corruption forces etc. 
  things that benefit from scale and authority that is n't tied to the parties being investigates . 
   movement of labor =  sure , it would be easier to move if every country speaks the same language , but if you 're deleting the countries culture , what 's the point of moving ? 
  maybe i 'm spoiled with the good language education in finland , but we have to know 4 languages to get out of high school . 
  knowing english by no means stops finns from knowing finnish . 
  maybe french people can only pull off a single language , but i think northern europe in particular can juggle 3-4 on average . 
  perhaps we 'll have to have something a bit easier for southern europeans ? 
  ( that 's sarcasm . 
  of course fucking french people can speak two languages , or 3 or 4 for that matter ) and what 's the point of moving ? 
  do you realize how much americans move around their country ? 
  why do you think they do it , even though alaska , hawaii , california , mississippi and nyc all speak english ? 
  or maybe you can even think of a * really * long list of reasons if you think about it . 
  and yea , everyone in france can still primary speak french and everyone in finland can still speak finish , but you can join a workplace in either and be perfectly rational in expecting to manage with english . 
  and yes , you can get a baguette in english too , but you 'll experience the country a great deal better if you learn the local language . 
  however , that has now become voluntary rather than mandatory . 
   if the eu would decide to make french classes mandatory from the beginning of school , in 20 years everybody thinking about joining the military would speak decent french and if we were to abolish english classes know despite american dominance in the cultural sphere , the quality of english knowledge among potential soldiers would go way down . 
  if the eu tried this , i would vote to leave the eu in a flash . 
  people get to pick what they want to learn , we 're not a bizarre command economy where such decisions get dictated to people . 
  people do n't want to learn french it seems . 
  so it goes . 
  move on . 
  yet people want to communicate with their peers from other countries , and the overwhelming # 1 choice for that is english , and barring a complete reversal of freedom of choice ( a terrible development ) , that seems likely to continue . 
   so it would be a policy decision either way . 
  one to agree to be practical , the other to be a totalitarian state . 
  i 'm sorry but there 's a small difference there . 
  and if we decide to go for a random language and force it on everyone like a proper totalitarian state , i will insist on finnish . 
  after all , at that point when human choices do not matter anymore , there 's no real case for why french would be better than finnish . 
  none speaks french . 
  there are maybe 3 times more english speakers than french speakers , and in the people who actively cross borders and facilitate europe 's growth that number is probably more like 5-6x . 
  so that makes zero sense . 
  it 's a huge issue , because ... 1 ) movement of labor is essential for a currency area . 
  it 's already almost completely free except for the huge practical problem of language . 
  a single language allows for easy movement . 
  2 ) movement of academic and research excellence . 
  this kind of already works , but only because cern etc function in english , as do all the top universities . 
  still , oxford , cambridge and lbs have been ** huge ** beneficiaries of the english language . 
  3 ) the military wo n't work without a single language , it simply wo n't . 
  4 ) any centralized departments will have some trouble without a single clear language . 
  the fbi equivalent ( which would make sense , particularly to root out corruption in the more corruption prone countries ) would be great for example , but would pretty much have to function in english . 
  the numbers are pretty rough , with ~ 190m eu citizens knowing english , and that being pretty much the whole educated and business elites . 
  the second highest count is german speakers that do n't really reach 100m , and include the dumbest 10 % of the native speakers , as well as all the children etc. 
  french , spanish and italian come even lower . 
  from a nationality perspective , countries with over a third ( !! ), 
  of their people able to speak english : ** germany ** , france , italy , poland , ** sweden ** , ** belgium ** , ** austria ** , ** greece ** , ** denmark ** , ** ireland ** , croatia , ** finland ** , ** slovenia ** , lithuania , latvia , ** estonia ** ( the ones in bold have over 50 % ) things i do not really believe with the multitude of languages : 1 ) joint defense ( just wo n't happen ) 2 ) efficient central bureaucracies 3 ) euro zone not having at least a few areas at any given time being disasters and * better off outside the euro * surely you can understand me wanting this resolved ideally ? 
  shame . 
  then europe will always have a limited future , and most of my optimism evaporates . 
  somewhat ironic that even with anglosphere such a shitshow , french pride is still a problem . 
  france really needs to get over its language for eu to progress . 
  it 's really that simple . 
  it 's all up to france , i think everyone else is game , but it 's a language problem now . 
  lets see if macron can get them over that . 
  we can do it too . 
  yet that 's quite pointedly not what most of the statistics are going on about . 
  they are going on about < total earned by women with maybe one or two limiting factors  / < total number of women in that group  vs the equivalent on the male side . 
  so if the average woman works less than the average man , then the average woman ** should ** make less money than the average man , obviously . 
  of course , none forces you to be an average woman and assuming you are because of your genitals is not ok . edit : to be honest , in a way it is , but this is where government is needed . 
  a 30 year old freshly married woman is definitely at risk of getting a baby . 
  there 's just no damn way of saying she is n't a higher pregnancy absence risk than a 50 year old single male .
