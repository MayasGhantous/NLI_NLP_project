  just none . 
  which is why trying to force that lie is ridiculous . 
  the problem should be tackled on the government side , making sure that childcare etc are sorted out in a way that allows the pregnancy not to meaningfully disrupt the company that is doing the hiring . 
  ( this can be very tricky , but just saying `` you ca n't take that in to account '' is moronically naive ), 
  they can be seen from space with the naked eye , and of course saudi-arabia shares basically all the policies ( and even iran shares more than a few ), 
  times seems reasonable . 
  i 'm perhaps most curious how the economist and financial times split . 
  they might be quite centrist and dependent on who exactly are running , if i would use myself as an example . 
  i 'd default to tory probably and really do n't like corbyn , but may is absolutely terrible and her instinctive hatred for fairly basic freedoms ( particularly regarding the internet ) make it impossible for me to see her as anything short of an enemy . 
  ( ignore the flag some , i might be finnish but i 've spent 5-6 years in the uk ), 
  while i sympathize with the humanitarian effort , i think germany is having far too many moving parts at the same time . 
  lock the border down ( and employ a huge chunk of greece in the process ) and then focus on unifying things internally . 
  and once it is a genuinely democratic process ( and not just merkel ) perhaps we can make some decisions with something resembling popular support . 
  ( also : the easiest issue to use against eu is the whole eu borderline encouraging sharia courts in europe . 
  regardless of the de facto things happening , that narrative mist be turned around by something more concrete than calling the people worrying about it idiots ), 
   you do realize that the first people that the nazis put in concentration camps were socialists and communists , right ? 
  of course they did . 
  but then again so did stalin . 
  economic policy is n't the only thing you can disagree about . 
  an extreme nationalist and an extreme internationalist in a time when blood is flowing * will * shoot at each other even if they share an identical view of what the government should do . 
  oh and besides the attitude to borders , there was the question of how authoritarian people were . 
  so saying nsdap has no socialist economic tendencies is silly . 
  of course it did . 
  it sure as hell was n't a free for all economy . 
  frankly , it was pretty centrist perhaps slightly left . 
  but many countries have been in a similar spot . 
  the thing about nsdap was never how far right or left it was , it was its attitude toward borders/nations and distribution of authority that made it bad . 
  it really was n't the important part about germany whether the government was involved in volkswagen ( it was ) and whether it was named the people 's car . 
  had the popular car been a mercedez or bmw fully independent of the government ... well , they were still gassing people and attacking countries . 
  in short : the left/right split is incredibly shallow and trying to put people who are basically out-of-bounds crazy on some other axis on to a single axis with essentially sane people is just ridiculous . 
  to be fair , he kind of was . 
  nationalism and socialism are on different axis that merely correlate with nationalism typically being associated with the right . 
  it kind of fits there because weak government and open borders mix somewhat poorly . 
  though hyper successful societies have made this work reasonably well in varied circumstances ( mainly britain and usa at their best ) . 
  significant government control works reasonably well with more open borders as the government has a great many tools inside the borders . 
  the issue is that a powerful government and extreme prejudices about people mix terribly . 
  and i would argue that t_d is really not particularly right wing at all economically . 
  `` america first '' is not a very right wing economic policy at all . 
  they are nationalists first and foremost , and frankly pretty left leaning ones with the president riding to rescue the fucking economy ( coal in west virginia !, 
  phone calls to ceos to stop jobs moving ! ), 
   politics and space policy do not mix well . 
  which is exactly why the private space with a more-or-less selfish agenda is far more powerful and needs to be encouraged . 
  nothing is quite as reliable as making something profitable in making people keep going at it . 
  as noble as the `` for humanity '' goal is , it has never worked long term and almost certainly never will . 
  well ... as someone who spends a lot of time in the us , this is not strictly speaking true . 
  the democrats in the us have a crazy regulation fetish which far exceeds what i suspect the finnish social democratic party would find reasonable . 
  i think it has to do with the fact that the democrats in the us have n't historically had enough power to realize how badly red tape can kill things . 
  the amount of red tape i have to deal with in the us actually often * far exceeds * the amounts dealt with in europe . 
  the biggest problem with democrats is that they still embrace the true-to-america hubris , possibly even more so than republicans if in a far more subtle way . 
  democrats might refer to european success in places like the nordics , ** but know fuck all about it ** . 
  i 've heard more democrats ( in rl and on reddit ) refer to the nordic countries as socialist than any other group , certainly more than republicans . 
  given 100 % of the senate and congress , i suspect the democrats might actually run the us in a very similar fashion to the average main stream left party in europe , except they would probably still refuse to learn from mistakes of those that have gone before . 
  that being said , i 'd still vote democrat in the us , but they have significant problems and a part of those manifests in using what i 'd consider `` left '' solutions , which is the height of idiocy . 
  left has great goals and shitty tools , and the right often is vice versa . 
  the us left compromises on the goals as long as it can use the tools ... makes a man despair . 
  dunno man ... greece is n't exactly the model citizen , and i 'm not sure i want to lend them shit to flip . 
  i do believe turkey would be a powerful asset some day , but i 'm not sure we can get far enough by 2023 . 
  it really has a great deal to do with how islam is faring in the world come that day . 
  one should never forget how fast things can move , especially with so many young people there . 
  internet is spreading ideas so very very fast , and in many ways turkey is wide open ( yes , they are very militant and imprison lots of reporters , but this is done more in the name of ataturk and turkey than islam , which opens the religion to considerable scientific critique ) . 
  who knows what might happen there culturally if properly encouraged . 
  yes , turkey is not denmark . 
  on the other hand i 'd argue it 's more similar to greece than greece is to denmark . 
  it could be a very powerful ally indeed . 
  i think i 'd be fine with eastern europe and russia . 
  plenty of super in that superstate :p hell , i 'll take iran , turkey and north africa before china , though we need to take some serious care in how that is done . 
  whoa uk is winning in this . 
  here i am , getting annoyed that so many shops close at 5-6pm on sundays ( and yes , they 're open on all sundays ) . 
  i can only imagine how infuriating it 'd be back in finland to deal with not being able to run chores during the weekend . 
  though to be fair , things were getting better fast there before i left the country in 2008 , and you could get tons of chores already done particularly during saturdays , and frankly even sundays were n't all that bad . 
  i agree , and i also think a country like tunisia would be far , far better than turkey . 
  in a way libya might be quite good too . 
  why ? 
  numbers game . 
  there are some extremely populous countries that can even be surrounded by other populous countries , and if you want to overwhelm a local culture you need to do it properly . 
  turkey and egypt are far too big to easily overwhelm , especially when comparing the numbers of youth . 
  muslim countries of a reasonable size would be : ** tunisia ** ( 10.7 million ) . 
  very close to europe and isolated quite nicely from its neighbours by desert ( and both its immediate neighbours are pretty small ) . 
  ** libya ** ( 6.4 million ) . 
  also rather close and it has lovely , lovely oil as a bonus . 
  however , there are some radical elements ( though with such a low population , suppressing them need not be too difficult if a proper media blitz is aimed and sustained ) and the extremely populous egypt is a neighbour and its population might interfere or force its politicians to interfere . 
  lebanon and azerbaijan are the only others that really fit the criteria , but they 're geographically way the hell out there so not really viable . 
  and we totally should n't do this until we have , for example , the eu equivalent of fbi ready to crack down on corruption . 
  perhaps by 2025 it 'll be interesting , though particularly libya might pay itself back really fast via the oil . 
  still , i would start flirting with tunisia and libya already , talking about the shared past history blahblah, 
  the strong historical ties go way past colonization . 
  tunisia used to be at the very core of europe for the longest of times . 
  i could certainly imagine the mediterranean basin joining the eu some day , as it has huge cultural affinity only soiled a little by islam . 
  assuming religion keeps retreating , i suspect many will be quite surprised at the similarities in underlying culture between northern africa and southern europe . 
  the historical border has always been the sahara desert . 
  it was the border during carthage , it was the border during rome and it was the border during post-roman barbarians and it remained a bloody border ( though finally a slightly porous one ) during islam . 
  ah reddit , nice to see quick fixes to silly posts . 
  so there was a knife , but there was no attack . 
  it 's healthy , and i think it 's supported by a rather healthy attitude . 
  if push came to shove , of * course * french and british people know their cultures are among the highest on the planet ( if not * the * highest ) . 
  i assume it must be like winning a nobel price in physics and someone asking you whether you 'd like to take the mensa test . 
  it 'd be easy to joke about how you 'd probably fail it ( and hell , you might ! ), 
  when you just do n't really give a shit about such petty nonsense . 
  i found it amusing as well , because the two countries with the greatest claims to cultural superiority ( britain and france ) thought least of themselves . 
  with the brits i know it 's because they can actually be civilized enough to not bother with such penis measuring contests and regularly take the piss out of themselves .
