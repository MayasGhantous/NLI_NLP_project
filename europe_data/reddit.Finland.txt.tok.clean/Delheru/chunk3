  if you do some proper blind testing on this and say , give 2 written reports in english and tell people that one was written by finns and one by americans/swiss/swedes / danes/germans/whoever , the odds are damn good that most finns would think that the finnish made one is the best . 
  do n't even mention the almost-third-world like russia , spain , latin america , italy etc. 
  china or india ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  i get a feeling that a significant segment of finns does not behave racist is because truly badass people do n't need to put people down . 
  think of it as that cool super hot girl/guy who talked with all the members of the opposite sex and was nice to them . 
  i mean , she 'd still ** never ** have sex with the ugly one , because eww . 
  it 's rather patronizing . 
  we might be best but we 're all very small and irrelevant and we 're not responsible for a fucking thing . 
  no matter how advanced we are , we moan about real world issues and wonder why the us does n't fix them . 
  or why germany , france and the uk do n't come together to fix them . 
  there 's considerable backlash about this with a `` if we 're so fucking great , why do n't ** we ** go solve the worlds problems ? '', 
  attitude visible among a lot of europhiles . 
  the previous one is also quite visible on the micro level where people often just prefer to be left alone . 
  weird mixture of collectivism and individuality probably traceable to a harsh environment where you had to work together , but where you could go for very long periods without interacting with others . 
  lots of the craziest mountain men in the usa have finnish heritage ( think montana , north dakota , that weird bit of michigan that looks like it should be part of wisconsin etc ) finns are ** very ** critical of everything . 
  but we improve because of it , and our rational negativity is one of the reasons we 're awesome - a lot of the complaints manifest in activity to get rid of the problem . 
  costa rica 's still in it . 
  greens resisting fusion is one of the dumber things i 've ever heard or even imagined . 
  my brain hurts even thinking about the level of idiocy required . 
  ** the ** civilization or perhaps `` the culture '' ( talking about optimistic reach here . . ), 
  the issue that a proper trading alliance that would make the eu competitive would be an easily accessible internal market . 
  that 's really what the us has going for it , and what china will have going for it . 
  this means harmonizing as much as possible : a ) currency ( got ) b ) language ( this is kind of happening , most modern apps for example are launched in english and have plenty of cross europe appeal ) c ) regulation . 
  if i launch a product in one country it should be fine in all the countries in the eu . 
  if i ca n't trust this , i 'll rather just go found my company in the us now this triggers further issues because the currency would ideally be in an optimum currency area ( oca ) which has several requirements so it does n't fuck up your economy . 
  like : * mobility of the work force ( language harmonization and border controls ... ) * capital mobility and less rigid salary structures . 
  some union related bargaining would have to move to the eu level etc * risk sharing cycle - we 'd have to have a way to fiscally inject ( not as debt ) money to places which require it in massive amounts throw on top of this some sort of military alliance and we 're basically 100 % of the way to a federal state already . 
  which one of these things that i listed would you prefer * not * to do , and what do you think the consequences of not doing such a thing would be ? 
  there are some considerable synergies in them being close to each other . 
  on the other hand you do make lobbyists jobs needlessly easy ( see gdp/cap in the washington region ) . 
   invalid logic . 
  the point is that one can be forced into prostitution . 
  one can be forced in to most jobs . 
  or rather , one is largely forced in to ** some ** job . 
  certainly it 's hard to imagine there are n't people who are very unhappy with their jobs running under any conceivable title out there . 
  the question is whether you can leave . 
  if you ca n't , that 's slavery , and again , a crime already . 
  no need to criminalize it again for its intent . 
  it 's like trying to avoid homicides of passion by banning showing of passion in public . 
  sure , there 's without a doubt a correlation , but the regulation seems : a ) taking a shotgun to kill a gnat b ) rather undermining of people 's civil liberties to do what they want with what is theirs ( their body and money ), 
  yes but all that you describe as a difference is largely caused by the stigma on sexual work rather than sexual work itself . 
  you can go two ways about this : cater to the irrational stigma or try to kind of wade through it to the other side . 
  the greatest example of catering to the stigma is probably the war on drugs . 
  not the greatest success tbh . 
  fair enough . 
  we should ban all jobs that have people doing them unhappily . 
  society will * almost * function after that . 
  yea a fresh army group would have been unpleasant to discover with a 20-30 % boost to the luftwaffe in the east . 
  russia would have also lost a war of attrition against germany in the long run - the kill ratio was worse against them than the population ratio was for them . 
  i never said anyone has to , though i would appreciate being able to track foreign events ( without the national filter ) when electing leaders of powerful countries . 
  i mean they do n't have to , just like american reborn christians can think that the second coming is nigh and throwing down in the middle east is a good idea . 
  granted , that 's an extreme version , but i have exactly the same right to judge both - the question is merely one of degree . 
   neither has your ability to discuss things in english any effect on your ability to make informed decisions simply knowing more than one language has actually been shown to have a considerable cognitive impact . 
  makes sense - you 'll understand that the word is not the thing , and that language shapes your thought ( my personality comes across very different in english and finnish , which amuses my friends quite a bit ) . 
  and of course , it does give you access to a fair bit more media . 
  though granted , often the media that whoever you 're looking at wants you to see ( rt ! = russian news , after all , nor is xinhua really what the chinese population hears ) . 
  still , better than none at all , assuming you have the sense to filter what you hear . 
   if all you do is read shit on reddit you are just as an liability to others as if you just would watch fox news . 
  of course if you have access to a huge amount of data and focus on a tiny bit of it , you do n't gain very much . 
  but this is fairly self evident and hence i 'm not sure why it 's worth pointing out . 
   and unless you travel the world extensively every waking hour you are n't quite at the pulse of things either . 
  none 's completely on the pulse of things , but i 've been on two different continents in 5 different countries in the past 10 days , so i try . 
  would calling their mindset `` provincial '' be better ? 
  in any case i 'm actually go on the counteroffensive here . 
  citizens in powerful countries - most critically the us , but also countries like germany - have a certain duty to understand what 's going on in the world . 
  why ? 
  because their votes matter . 
  so i actually * will * insult people who are very focused only on their immediate surroundings . 
  or i certainly will if they insist on voting in national elections . 
  if you only care about your town and shit , that 's fine , but do n't vote in the elections and just pick the mayor for springfield , < insert us state  or wherever you happen to be in germany . 
  why am i being a douche ? 
  bumpkin being a patronizing term i suppose ? 
  i guess it comes from who you 're surrounded by when you grow up . 
  helsinki ( or well , espoo ) is very internationalist in outlook . 
  everyone i know back in finland seems to leave the country 4-20 times every year . 
  being unable to name anyone that does n't leave the country at least annually makes me obviously quite confused about who such people might be . 
  i did n't say you `` have to '' . 
  plenty of bumpkins on the planet and they 're welcome to being such . 
  if you have no particular ambition nor interest in the wider world , english is a pointless waste of your time . 
  i just have trouble wrapping my head around the mindset , but that says more about me than the mindset arguably . 
  do n't germans travel quite a bit ? 
  i know a whole bunch of germans and almost all of them speak flawless english . 
  perhaps my social circles are not very typical though . 
  you 're kind of by definition a bumpkin if you can not function in the modern world these days , and that means knowing english . 
  so much for interacting with people from other parts of the world ( or having the ability to travel anywhere ) . 
  also , you 'll miss out on a hell of a lot of entertainment . 
  yea that was my first thought too . 
  so many ukrainians did n't want to fight other ukrainians and laid down their arms . 
  i guess this is a good way to stop * that * from happening again . 
  then again , i wonder if that 's the point . 
  germany made the mistake on the world stage once . 
  did not rise early , found french and english flags all over the bloody world . 
  never again . 
  pakistan is far from knowing exactly whom to kill . 
  it seems to be a mixture of indians , all westerners , their own secularists , their women and getting people in afghanistan killed also seems top of the list . 
   it 's when you 've so absorbed a set of ideas that you begin to think of them as natural , as objective , as universal , as inevitable . 
  and you think the basic laws of supply and demand are n't just that ? 
  what 's artificial about them ? 
  it 's about as basic logic as 1 +1 = 2 .
