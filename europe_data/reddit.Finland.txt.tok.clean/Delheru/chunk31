  also : the breivik case shows how important it is to not react even a little bit to flares of hatred from what is literally * one millionth * of the total population . 
  you 're right , of course , but the issue is that the longer the issue gets postponed , the more extreme the solutions become . 
  think of it as a guy psyching himself up for a fight . 
  the more people see islam as something that might require a final solution ( very intentionally used ) in europe , the more they psych themselves up not to see muslims as humans . 
  i have no doubt that most people would love to see the situation defused , but lets be real here - i suspect a majority of europeans would get rid of every muslim in europe rather than suffer sharia in europe . 
  if you 're on the fence about that , i suggest having a daughter - you 'll be ready to do some fairly horrible things to prevent them from being dropped to a second grade citizen . 
  edit : forgot to be constructive . 
  i think * none * would be particularly worried about it if people making such death threats would just be thrown to jail and/or deported , and governments formal response to a `` but we are outraged ! '', 
  emanating from the middle east would be to promise $ 10m worth of napalm to israel for every single religiously motivated act against european citizens ( murders , but also scaling over a embassy wall etc ) . 
  i suspect most muslims would thank us for bitchslapping their crazed 0.1 %, 
  where did you think you got it from ? 
  native americans ? 
  there are n't that many of them . 
  and even if there were ... 
  there 's ** no ** way we can lose to religious extremism , but we might surrender to it . 
  the mechanisms just need to be such that the north temporarily dominates until the corruption has been sorted . 
  rather like us after the civil war . 
  otherwise i agree - the risk is that the north gets infected by the south , rather than bringing a ( slightly ) more sane political culture to everyone . 
   should society issues ( think gay marriage ) really be decided at the european level ? 
  note that this is contested even inside the us still , so not like a federation really binds those decisions to the federal level ... 
   to address # 2 . 
  the uk is an almost all public university environment , not like the us . 
  our universities are quite a lot poorer than the likes of harvard . 
  oxford and cambridge colleges still have quite monstrous endowments , but admittedly not on the level of a harvard or princeton . 
   however their low fees ( until now ) compared to the us allows them to get the geniuses who might not be able to study at harvard due to cost . 
  it 's not that . 
  in many ares , oxford for example is considered far superior to pretty much anywhere . 
  if you want political power per student maxed out , try magdalen ppe students that were active at oxford union ( which brings us to another point about some of the uk universities : oxford union is not even a part of the university , so its endowment does n't count ... of course , it only allows oxford students and alum ) . 
  in general the less money is needed for teaching , the less the budgets matter . 
  sure , doing rocketry at caltech will be awesome compared to cambridge , but what 's the difference between doing philosophy , politics , economics , finance etc at oxford or harvard ? 
  ( this does n't ignore your point that there are poor people that might apply to uk universities but not the us ones , but i 'm just pointing out that just because you do have money does not mean you prefer the us ones ... unless it 's for some super expensive research , in which case the odds are decent that a super rich us university does lead the field ) . 
  as someone that went to one of those four , the anglosphere has some genuine advantages that mean that these lists are fairly credible . 
  ** # 1 ** vast , uninterrupted wealth . 
  oxford and cambridge ( as well as places like harvard ) have been building up their fortunes for ages . 
  university of paris is older than any of them , but france has had revolutions , been occupied etc numerous times ... this sort of thing disrupts it quite badly . 
  this can also be seen in sweden ( another place that has been building up wealth for a long time without major disruption ) doing quite well in the tables . 
  ** # 2 ** a more `` elite '' approach than many other places . 
  in places with mainly publicly funded universities , the differences in budgets do n't get quite as insane as they are between a harvard and a < insert-unknown-us-university  . 
  if i understand it correctly , talent on both teaching and studying side is far more evenly distributed in germany ( for example ) than in the us/uk . 
  ** # 3 ** the english language . 
  you can suck talent from all over the place , and you do . 
  lets face it , the german ( or french ) speaking talent pools are pathetically small when compared to the english speaking talent pool ( especially when you realize that the english skills are focused on top academic performers in high schools around the world ) nowadays the differences are getting smaller , but the historical inertia will be very difficult to overcome . 
  yup , but the lack of labor mobility is a huge problem with the euro . 
  english as a language has rather grown above and beyond england . 
  i do n't care if england is n't even in the eu - it 's the language i talk with the germans , swedes and spaniards in business * even though i can speak all three languages * ( real shitty spanish though , admittedly ) . 
  i have n't met anyone particularly credible who was n't able to write their research articles in english etc. 
  it 's already the de facto language of business and science - giving it formal political support ( and the position as the de jure primary language of eu ) is the only possibility as far as languages go . 
   if we want to solve this problem with structural reform , we must make eurozone into more optimal currency area . 
  there 's one huge problem that could be addressed that is way bigger than the `` fiscal transfer mechanism '' , and that 's the first thing about an optimal currency area : labor mobility we 're going to have to wing this to one degree or another until the labor mobility problem is sorted . 
  sure , on paper labor mobility is good , but this is in spite of the eu ( which thinks that french is as important a language as english , in a tireless crusade against the windmills ) rather than because of it . 
  lots of people know english fortunately , but if i take 100 small businesses from germany/france and 100 would-be employees from greece and spain , the language fit wo n't be anywhere near 100 % - it might be more like 20-25 % , most of which will be english spoken on both sides . 
  so one of the very first things we need to do if we want the euro area to work is to admit on a very high level that english is the lingua franca , and eu will provide extraordinary support for people in that language ( and wo n't replicate it to a million other languages ) . 
  the way the fiscal transfer mechanism would have to be done would almost certainly be via some sort of taxation ability of the eu . 
  as that would in general be wildly unpopular with anything local , i suspect that the financial industry would be a good first target for the taxes . 
  perhaps 10 % capital gains tax on the eu level would also be popular enough , as it would discourage wealthy people from playing around with their money inside the eu . 
   the problem with insuring bank deposits is that if we going to cover them 100 % i think the typical approach is something like `` up to 250k '' . 
  that does n't cover quite everything , but it does cover enough that a run on the bank becomes incredibly unlikely . 
   another thing is that any insurance seem should be mandatory , because we already have a common banking market thanks to sepa , so allowing member states to toil away with something would sooner or later cause another crisis . 
  given this crisis , i suspect the end users that use the banks would pay a great deal of attention to which banks have the backing of the party that can print money . 
  still , if the regulations are stifling , i can see the end user benefits being such that a free rider problem might evolve ( trusting that implicitly everyone is insured ) . 
   when a town or county is put under receivership in us , it is not about injecting money , but replacing ineffective leadership and then doing in quick manner cost cutting and settling down with different debtors , for example cutting down pensions . 
  yes , the higher level ( be that state or federal ) will take 100 % control of the budget . 
  do you think eu has the expertise for this , except in theory ? 
  why would it maintain any special abilities for this ? 
  ( unless you feel that the eu budget is a better run ship than the national ones ... 
  i suspect it 's run worse due to the limited interest anyone has in active oversight as long as the vast majority of money is in the nations ), 
   i think your point if view is common misconception of the situation . 
  i kept my answer short . 
  i 'm one of those that believe that the people behind the euro were federalists that knew this day was coming ( i certainly expected it ) . 
  the crisis would be a great way to push for integration that would otherwise be nearly impossible to achieve quickly . 
  still , that is just the eurozone propagating and being vulnerable to the crisis . 
  it does not change the fact that the crisis did originate somewhere , and the weakness of others allowed it to spread . 
  the fact that these were to be expected does not change the issues that there is a source-of-crisis and weak countries . 
   i do n't see why spain should be part of system where it ca n't prevent bubbles from forming , but must tighten the belt when shit hits the fan . 
  well , that 's a question for the spanish . 
  still , there are ways such bubbles can be prevented from forming . 
  i suggested to jrohila that there should be eu level deposit insurance that would be tied to specific eu level banking regulation . 
  that banking regulation could have a few caveats tied to exposure to countries that would be related to the banks size , target economy size , target economy indebtedness . 
  of course , a glut of investment still could n't be stopped , but one wonders if we would really want to . 
  yes , over-investment creates some huge hiccups for the economy , but fundamentally ** things are being built ** ( typically anyway ) . 
  housing booms almost always end up in busts , but they also tend to result in very nice and ( post-boom ) reasonably priced housing for tons of people . 
  this sort of booming can be moderated a little , but at the very end of the day one wonders if it really would have been better for spain to not have had the boom ( for example ) . 
  especially if a skilled historian looks at it from , say , 2050 . 
  ps : lots of finnish flags flying around here . 
  reasonable points . 
  perhaps we would insure the bank deposits on a eu level , with that being fully an opt-in sort of thing . 
  it is n't mandated on anyone , but if you do n't follow the regulations , your deposits wo n't be insured . 
  then lets see whether the market decides that it wants to trust non-insured deposits , greek govt insured deposits or eu insured deposits . 
  i think in general lifting the bigger banks ( who should still be kept small enough to fail , obviously ) to be eu level institutions would be tremendously helpful , as that would prevent the local governments from bullying them to pick up huge amounts of government debt - something that 's always tempting to do , and is actually a very powerful tool on a currency level ( ie washington and beijing can do it , as could brussels theoretically , but athens , helsinki or berlin ca n't ) . 
   a system where whole states can be put on receivership . 
  considering you criticized transfers of fiscal power ... this is the ultimate transfer of fiscal power , and eu would have to have mechanisms for dealing with the huge transfer of power . 
  i was n't advocating that eu would run the finances at all times , but it would have to maintain the ability to do so in case someone goes in to receivership . 
  but the motivation to do the structural reforms goes away if germany simply underwrites everything . 
  power for responsibility is basically the trade-off here : the south must yield some to the federal level , which then needs to be dominated by the underwriters , and all of this needs to be done in a way that makes it clear that the transfer of power from south to north is not inherent in the system , but simply a result of financial stability ( so in case the north fucks up and south is doing fine , the situation would reverse ) . 
  i think they are very well placed with a number of great characteristics : a ) they have excess cash to throw at pr , even more so than pretty much anyone else ( thanks oil ! ), 
  b ) they are considered an extremely civilized nation in a way that next to none challenges ( as is the case with the us ) c ) they treat their minorities and poor well . 
  considering that in many struggles the people rebelling are either minorities or the poor , this tends to make them easy to deal with ( again , in dramatic contrast with the us ) d ) they do n't have strategic interests except a vague preference for smooth world trade ( in contrast not only with the us , but practically all large nations ) i would say most nordic countries could do as well ( switzerland might not , as it is perceived very pro-rich due to its banks ) , but norway happens to have that extra bit of wealth from the oil that allows it to go the extra mile for absolutely no compensation . 
  yes , this creates a problem on the ` c ' front , as they do n't feel particularly connected to the society . 
  of course , any problems with ` c ' will creates a huge problem on the ` a ' front , and down the rabbit hole you go . 
  this is why we need to avoid such areas developing in the first place - it 's just very , very hard to imagine how such people could integrate .
