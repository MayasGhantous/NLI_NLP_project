  it 's kind of like places with massive expat communities . 
  for example dubai . 
  why would any western integrate there when there 's a ready made community that is all very familiar to you already ? 
  absolutely agreed . 
  people are people . 
  every arab i 've known for more than a year has been ( or become ) atheist and hates the governments that rule the arab world . 
  i do know muslims who were more devout than that ( pakistani immigrants to canada living in the uk ) , and they were some of the nicest people in the world . 
  actually , they might have been * the * nicest people i 've ever met , and i 've met some pretty damn nice people . 
  however , islam functions often rather like racism has historically . 
  it 's a way for people who do n't feel very high up the performance ladder to feel good about themselves and part of something greater . 
  the reason someone in a parisian slum shouts `` allahu akbar ! '', 
  is very similar to the reason why someone in a small alabama town might say `` white power ! '', 
  you look for the peer group that : a ) accepts you b ) you can be proud of c ) you have some connection to of course , this is where europeans could be helpful . 
  if ` a ' was n't such a failure so often , i suspect islam would fade from the new immigrants faster than it could be shipped to europe . 
  i 'll be helpful and say it . 
  all arab countries are culturally and institutionally far inferior to practically any western nation . 
  if i had to choose between british or saudi-arabian culture becoming the global norm , i might pick ** 15th century ** ( !! ), 
  gb before modern day saudi-arabia . 
  i say this without any racism or any particular dislike of islam ( the other monotheisms are hardly better . 
  or rather , they are better because they have been mostly neutered ) . 
  i 'm not talking about the private sector . 
  every company worth anything is already completely fluent in english anyway . 
  i 'm not saying we would try to wipe the other languages out . 
  even if we could i would n't want to . 
  however , the government should n't burden itself by trying to operate in 20 languages at once , and we should n't keep sending mixed signals about languages to the population . 
  essentially the message is that everyone should learn english on top of their native language , but i would hope people would learn 1-3 others on top of those . 
  frankly this already happens everywhere except brussels , so it 'd be nice if the french stop fantasizing about french as a language being in any way comparable to english in international use . 
   can you elaborate this a bit more ? 
  are you talking about that english as a second language should be mandatory in school ? 
  or all legal documents in every country should be translated into english ? 
  i 'm hoping the latter two are just consequences . 
  the primary regulation would just be that business in brussels will be done in english , and any translation of public documents to a local language is the concern of the local state ( be it sweden , finland or italy ) , not the eu . 
  most kids already learn english anyway , but this would admittedly be added incentive . 
  as for the legal documents ... well ... most of the international agreements are in english by default anyway , so i 'm not sure much would change ( and i 'm not sure why we 'd care about the language of the will of someone that never left naples ) . 
   i think it would be preferred that it would be located in a smaller country with a relatively healthy economy and with the least corruption in the eu ( wien , helsinki , stockholm , copenhagen , amsterdam ? ), 
  heartily agreed . 
  i just do n't think it would have much credibility if it was located in naples . 
   this sounds a lot easier than what it actually is . 
  it 's a good idea but who should decide when enough is enough ? 
  this can be quantified easily enough : ious worth 20 % of the local gdp are in circulation ( ie you ran out of money a while ago ) . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 'm hoping you 're trolling . 
  in case you 're not , i 'm curious what 's so special about the swedish `` sub race '' ? 
  ( and how you imagine it has n't intermingled the hell out of whatever is in russia for ages since the vikings started going down russian rivers ), 
  hereditary enemy , but mainly in the sense that england was to france . 
  england kept attacking france . 
  france kept attacking germany . 
  it 's a rare occasion of german troops anywhere near major french cities , whereas french troops near frankfurt was kind of bi-annual . 
  of course this had a lot to do with the centralized nature of the french state ( by comparison to the holy roman empire ) , but it does n't change the fact that in the germano-french setup , it 's very hard to find a time where germany declares war in france with the intent to attack it for whatever reason . 
  sure , it ends up fighting france frequently even when its stronger , but that is because france is trying to contain it . 
  ditto france always ended up fighting england because england was trying to contain * it * . 
   germany 's only fault is having become a big and powerful central power ... that 's intimidating and calls for natural reactions . 
  yup . 
  though it is cynical in the ** extreme ** for france and britain to feel that `` overly powerful nations '' should be kept in check . 
  i think you can probably make a pretty decent case that germans do n't get along superbly well with poland and lithuania , but that 's about it . 
  russia did n't like them much better . 
  as a finn we 've always gotten along splendidly with germany , and i 've certainly never sensed anything resembling hostility . 
  pretty sure germany has n't done anything to portugal either , or its ally britain . 
  hell , a pretty solid case can be made that germany has never had anything against france either - in 1871 , 1914 and 1939 france was always the one that went to war ( to `` contain '' german power ... whether that 's a good enough reason to go to war is anyone 's guess . 
  sure , there was the `` expansionism is bad '' reason too , but coming from the second biggest empire of all time the hypocrisy of that is a bit overwhelming ) . 
  uh i wish . 
  this is where finland shows russian influence - alcohol often just makes us more dangerous . 
   it has a risk of producing non-consenting offspring with a proven colossally increased risk of severe genetic damage apparently not in the first generation . 
  repeating it a few times does cause a major danger , however . 
  in any case incest is sex between relatives - reproduction is a different issue , and can be banned separately . 
  i mean if the brother has his tubes tied , sister has a birth control patch and they 're using a condom while the sister is giving the brother head , what exactly is the problem , besides the `` ick '' ? 
  obviously the reason for the taboo is the long term genetic damage , which has to get ground in pretty easily rather like heterosexuality : you 're more likely to pass on your genes if you do n't have retarded children ( or in the case of people who do n't want to have sex with the opposite gender , not having children at all ) . 
  necrophilia technically could be ok i suppose , there 's really no logical argument against it except the `` that 's fucking nasty '' one that is most often summoned against lgbt as well . 
  after all , it 's just a pile of decaying flesh ... kind of like making love to a pile of ground beef ( that some other human potentially has an emotional connection with ) . 
  incest is another one that is mainly resisted because of the `` ick '' factor . 
   i thought babies were excluded from the competition as you have to be a willing participant . 
  darwin is about passing on your genes . 
  i think you deserve one if you think blowjobs result in babies and end up childless . 
  admittedly ending up childless because * you kill your children * is rather unhappier . 
   do n't be a dick . 
  are they lesser human beings because they are religious ? 
  no , but they kinda are for insisting they need to mutilate their children . 
  i 'm pretty indifferent to their logic behind it . 
  it 'd be just as retarded if it circumcision was considered a sign of being a true capitalist , true socialist or , say , a true finn ( who actually are , for the most part , really retarded ) . 
  that being said , an outright ban might be harsh , but with modern political correctness still holding quite considerable sway , it 's very hard to communicate the `` holy fuck you 're child mutilating insane people '' message with sufficient clarity and penetration . 
   by the way , what if the law backfires and we 'll see and increased number of deaths due to non-medical and unhygienic circumcisions ? 
  darwin awards ? 
  i do n't think the `` we 'll hurt our children worse if you do n't let us hurt them a little '' thing really works as a justification . 
  it 's kind of life trying to stop a parent from hitting a child ... you know there 's a risk that the person will flip and just kill the whole family . 
  it 's a poor excuse not to intervene . 
  in any case most jewish people i know are very sensible ( admittedly i do n't know any ultra-orthodox ones ) and would n't take that sort of risk with their babies . 
  what they might do is fly to israel or something to get it done , and that 's just fine . 
  the problem might be more severe among the less affluent muslim minority , but i 'm pretty sure the circumcision thing is n't taken quite as seriously among them so i suspect the vast majority there will just let it drop . 
  the die hard religious will keep killing their children probably , but i 'm quite serious when i say that i ca n't help but see the silver lining in that . 
  yea , but medical procedures that risk death for minor , minor benefit are pretty insane . 
  why not remove some other useless shit while you 're at it ? 
  pretty sure humans could function perfectly well with , say , 4 fingers ( assuming the one removed is n't the thumb ) . 
  why not do that ? 
  but the fundamental here is that there is zero religious requirement for it , in the sense that god would actually give a shit . 
  i 'd say if god does n't require it , even appealing to religious freedom ( which europe generally speaking does n't acknowledge unconditionally , and which would n't be absolute in any case ) seems a lost cause . 
  so it 's something you can brag to other people with ? 
  ( `` i have a closer relationship with the god than you ! '' ), 
  seriously . 
  what you said makes judaism seem more sensible , but it makes the penis-cutters seem even more pathetic . 
  i 'm not actually sure if the genitalia bit is key for getting to heaven/hell .
