   `` the greatest value creation machine in history '' . 
  which only creates value for a few . 
  yes . 
  true . 
  veritably the average scotsman has gained nothing in the past 300 years of capitalism , and most people would happpily go to living in 1714 . 
  of course people now have tremendous amounts of stuff that they did n't have before . 
  how come you have access to the internet ? 
  are you of the 1 % ?!? 
   all of these wonders that you point to , including the ones in east asia , are at least partly products of state intervention propping up markets yes , but the chinese state was `` propping up markets '' for a long time , but until it gave people some freedoms in how to create value , it was n't really going anywhere . 
  so you need a few key bits of free market capitalism . 
  you ca n't get it done well , but you can avoid the opposite of free market capitalism is : a ) price control ( read : markets are n't free ) b ) equity and ownership for what you build are not concepts ( read : no capitalism ) once you get rid of those two , things get a lot better . 
  surely it is a very leftist view to be for `` a '' & `` b '' . 
  i mean , if you are n't against those two , you are n't against free market capitalism . 
  you might want to alleviate its bad effects , but to be against it , you have to be for price controls for example . 
   your free market exists nowhere in a pure form , for every good economic reason . 
  absolutely . 
  and i 've mocked libertarians who believe that they could exist like that many , many times in these messages . 
  the problem with free markets is that the rational thing for any and every company to do is to seek monopoly . 
  and that 's fine . 
  but the moment it reaches monopoly , it 'll shut the door behind itself . 
  it 'd be like women electing al qaeda to run their country - one vote , once . 
  so yes , the government is ** absolutely mandatory ** in making free market capitalism work , or even close to work . 
  anyone who thinks it can is smoking something ( these are the true libertarians ) . 
   but merely what they are willing to pay for . 
  go see this bit of art or have a twix bar ? 
  i 'll have the twix . 
  this is what i mean with talk being so cheap - i do n't really know what you care about until you put your money ( ie your work , ie * hours of your life * ) where your mouth is . 
  will i do this essential work for 20 minutes longer to go see piece of art x. 
  it does say something about the art if everyone says `` absolutely ! '', 
  or everyone says `` no '' . 
   you 're saying that absolutely everything must have a cash value and a price on it to be worth anything no . 
  but if none thinks it 's worth $ 1 , that 's a pretty heavy judgment being rendered . 
  for example i could go to a comedy club and then try to sell a dvd of me telling jokes . 
  people might politely chuckle when i 'm on stage , but then not buy any of the dvds . 
  call me materialist , but my assumption based off this would n't be that they do n't appreciate me , but rather that i 'm not particularly funny . 
   it means that you can not conceive of an experience , a moment , a love affair , a work of art , a memory , a beautiful woman , a view , without putting a cash value on it and conceptualising it as a commodity . 
  i certainly can , and would like to . 
  yet i 'd like to point out that those truly do have value that is well acknowledged , because people frequently do pay for all of the above - quite extraordinary sums i might add . 
  so everything you think has value , someone is paying for . 
  unsurprising , and goes to show that you share a view of value which syncs up with your average human . 
  how awful mainstream of you . 
   it 's a philosophy that any normal human would feel sickened by . 
  yet next to none is . 
  everyone is buying in to it constantly . 
  so perhaps your definition of `` normal '' is actually a kind of small percentage of the population ( also fitting the definition of `` abnormal '' ) . 
   i think it 's worse than nazism , worse than stalin , worse than a serial killer or a child molester . 
  ... and yet i , of the two of us , is the one who considers life beyond value . 
  apparently having to deal with wal-mart is worse than millions killed . 
  and i 'm the disgusting one ? 
  i really think your ' e pretty far off the deep end here . 
   and you call it `` humanity 's progress '' !, 
  we 've come from monkeys and we 're reaching for the stars . 
  on the back of a die hard capitalist entrepreneur nonetheless ( elon musk ) . 
  yes , it 's fucking progress . 
   let 's be honest here : you would be taking up arms to defend your own financial interests and class privilege you keep telling yourself that . 
  you know me as well as i know you . 
  i 've met your type . 
  often you 're the type of man who 's a bit angry that he does n't seem to be getting what he thought he deserved . 
  it ca n't be his fault , so it must be the systems ( or in tragic cases , `` the women '' , and then one of you guys and starts murdering people , which makes sense since in your opinion `` the system '' is worse than the mass killing of tens of millions , as you so clearly put it ) . 
  so yea . 
  the system is keeping you and your buddies down . 
  what you fail to notice that huge numbers of people are thriving and living great lives that the emperor of china just a hundred years ago would barely have dreamed of . 
  but not everyone is up to snuff . 
  and they get angry . 
  and then they really think they are n't the only ones angry . 
  these type of people join whatever seems popular and allows them to channel their anger . 
  be it the global jihad , the radical left , the radical right or you name it . 
  the cause does n't matter , the ability to * blame the other * does . 
  and yes , you 're still the minority , and always will be , because sensible adults typically sort these things out before the situation gets too bad . 
  and in the insanely unlikely scenario where some subclass of this type of nutjob ( right/left/religious , matters not ) gets bad enough , we 'll co-opt their little revolution easily enough . 
   `` supply and demand is not an ideology '' . 
  of course it is . 
  the logic of `` if there 's 10 items and 11 people want one , there 'll be trouble , but if there 's 9 people there wo n't be is hardly an ideological statement . 
  more like an extension of extremely basic logic . 
   so your idea of the values of the left is this : people jumping off an aeroplane ? 
  just my idea of the sensibility of people wanting to disrupt the greatest value creation machine in history . 
  do n't worry , lots of right wingers are equally crazy in this . 
  religious nutters too , which can be right * or * left leaning ( though granted , at this point in time , typically right ) . 
   ( i cringed at the americanism `` airplane '' ) they invented the damn thing so it seems fair enough to let them name it . 
   i do n't know what you 've contributed , and you do n't know what i 've contributed , but this is not the place for your boasting , and i 'm not going to listen to it . 
  but talk is so cheap . 
  everyone can distribute stuff that others have earned . 
  in this you 're non better than the worst imaginable capitalist who extracts value from downtrodden employees ( or hell , slaves ) . 
  still , i 'm one of those people who are more interested in the size of the pie ( for all of mankind ) rather than how it 's distributed . 
  not that i 'm not interested in that as well , but the key is to care about both . 
   i do n't talk only for myself , but for the millions , yes millions , who agree with me . 
  based on how the world is behaving , i suspect i have more than a billion people that agree with me . 
  but now we both get in to speculating about the support bases . 
  yet , free market capitalism is , if anything , on the rise in the world - just look at the wonders it 's working in east asia . 
   encourages creativity only in one direction ; that of profit . 
  yea heaven forbid you create something that ** someone puts some value on ** . 
  true creativity is useless to everyone . 
  i 've seen these types of theater plays where you throw feces on the audience , but i 'm really not sure if i consider it `` real creativity '' . 
  give me an example of real ( and not pointless ) creativity that created no value ( in the sense that someone would pay for it ) but was yet valuable . 
  doubt you 'll manage anything useful . 
   is incrementally ruining the world and filling it full of shit , by turning fucking everything and everyone into a commodity , and infesting all values and everything sacred and beautiful with this impersonal , cold , deadly nexus of market exchange . 
  you 're welcome to that opinion . 
  those of us who rather like it seems to be winning . 
  that being said , i very much feel like we should be doing more to deal with the potential to `` lose '' in modern society . 
  it really should not happen and we should guarantee a comfortable level of living to everyone .
