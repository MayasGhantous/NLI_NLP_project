  but overthrow the market system ? 
  it 'd be crazy enough that i 'd defend humanity 's progress with violence if it came to that , and i would n't even hesitate . 
   apparently you did n't notice the grinding poverty that many , many people have to live in . 
  but i also saw how fast things are improving . 
  so many places were truly terrible just a few decades ago , but suddenly you can do pretty well in a number of them . 
  hell , even africa is beginning to boom now which is awesome . 
   you have so absorbed this ideology that you are not even conscious of it as an ideology . 
  supply and demand is not an ideology , nor an ideological concept . 
  admitting that humans are complicated and that predicting their wants is very hard is closer to humility than ideology - the hubris to claim otherwise is just mindblowing . 
  other than that i have n't claimed real faith in anything ( universal healthcare i suppose , but i guess you can tell me how i 'm misguided to believe in that ) . 
   sighing patronisingly over the silly people who say everything is n't perfect and things need to be changed no , sighing ( granted , patronizingly ) over people who are on board an airplane and who think that the whole idea is foolish and that if we jumped off it , we could go faster . 
  i 'd like to be a little more careful about it than that . 
   is something that you ought to be deeply ashamed about why would i be ? 
  by pretty much every definition i bet i 've created more value than the vast majority of people - even given similar opportunities - manage in a lifetime . 
  i 'm extremely proud of being one of those people that actually make things happen and keep the world progressing . 
  for one of my kind there 's a dozen people like you , just moaning and bitching without really contributing very much . 
  like i mentioned elsewhere in this thread : it is n't what you say , it 's what you ** do ** that matters in real world among adults . 
  pray tell , what do you ** do ** that would make me respect you ? 
   also , if there is less poverty now , and less war now , it is because of ordinary people 's work and organisation . 
  it is in spite of your beloved capitalism and not because of it . 
  capitalism is a system of organization and resource allocation . 
  obviously it requires ordinary people to work in it . 
  capitalism killed feudalism ( as per marx ) and none denies how much it can do . 
  marx failed to understand how incredibly creative people would be under capitalism , which has allowed the system to thrive much longer than he expected . 
  which , i suppose , is real nice , as that shows that people are shockingly resourceful . 
   no , most of us are not very happy with where we are sir . 
  you speak for yourself . 
  want to guess who you talk for ? 
  yourself . 
  looks like 50/50 so far . 
  sigh . 
  you can wish for your little revolution as much as you wish , you 'll just die disappointed . 
  most of us are ** very happy with where we are ** . 
  i do n't understand why i 'd be even in the least bit interested in overthrowing a system that not only is serving humanity very well ( rising standards of living , less war than ever etc ) but serving me personally even better ( visited 40ish countries , net worth 7-digits and age low 30s ) . 
  i guess my happy life is being used to brainwash me in to believing that everything is ok with me . 
  shame i do n't have your dazzling intellect to understand that just getting everything i want , living in peace and making a meaningful contribution to humanity is somehow a bad thing . 
  what else is the autonomous left known for ? 
  hamas at least helps the local poor . 
  these guys i know for nothing except being `` anti-fascist '' by beating up people for their political opinions . 
  a shame the irony truck is n't a real thing or the problem would solve itself . 
  where you can tell that i 'm from the `` european '' right and my major nod towards leftist ideal is that i ** do ** believe that a society is best judged on how those worst off are in it . 
  and no , i do not believe that the free market will take care of that in any way . 
  the free market is a superbly powerful engine for creating value , but it does n't give a shit about anyone . 
  i heartily disagree with anyone that thinks we should turn off the engine because of this , but i also disagree with anyone that thinks we should leave it alone . 
   market libertarianism i was n't defending it . 
  i think all the completely anti-authoritarian ideals are similarly naive and foolish . 
  i just pointed out that what i consider silliness on the left ( anarchism ) has its equivalent silliness on the right ( libertarianism ) . 
  there 's nothing inherently individual liberty oriented about the left , and i would argue that inherently it 's the right that is more individual liberty oriented ( though it has trouble dealing with the fact that financial chains can be just as heavy as ones laid down with threats of violence ) . 
   i think your ideas are utterly bizarre they have created everything we have so far , to a point where the only reason you 're able to type this on a computer on the internet is because of these ideals . 
  your ideals have n't seem to have caused anything except bloodshed . 
   i think you know nothing about politics i know lots about history though , and as people are always saying things , i find history is , you know , something that actually means something , unlike political rhetoric which is fundamentally meaningless . 
   i think you 're in the grip of an ideology . 
  the irony if you saying that is pretty good . 
  what ideology am i in the grip of ? 
  you seem to lack basic reading comprehension if you think i support libertarians . 
  i like many of their ideals , just like i like several of the things anarchists stand behind , it 's just their inability to touch reality with a 10 meter stick that is a cause for concern . 
   i do think it 's a shame that people in scandinavia should adopt american political discourse wholesale . 
  of course we do n't . 
  the us sucks at a lot of things and in a variety of different ways . 
  sometimes they are ideologically adamant and wrong because of that ( healthcare ) . 
  sometimes they are ideologically right but so corrupt/inept in execution that the end result is a disaster ( telecoms/isps ) . 
   your use of these buzzwords what buzzwords ? 
  you have n't said a single thing in all of this that makes any sense except try to be vaguely patronizing without anything resembling a basis for being able to do so . 
  you realize how immature you come across as just actively trying to annoy me without any substance , right ? 
  i mean maybe you 're just trolling ( it seems likely ) , but you 're certainly not winning any supporters for whatever the hell your cause is . 
  that 's a huge , huge group of people . 
   you seem to have followed the american way of looking at things , where everything is opposite . 
  a ) my views are a hybrid of finland , uk and us mainly b ) everything is opposite of what ? 
  i mean you do realize that equality of outcomes and individual liberty are not compatible ? 
  there has to be compromise , and i agree there should be . 
  full on liberty is anything but equal , and as such the most `` pure '' liberals/libertarians will be found on the right . 
  i mean , they are smoking crack and just as far from reality as your average communist , but there 's no denying they 're generally speaking more right wing . 
  what a weird to put what the right believes . 
  i 'd say it 's more that the right believes in the fundamentals of economics and the complexity of human societies . 
  this means that centralized planning is considered fruitless and hence just plain foolish by the right . 
  i 'd also say the right believes that people are driven by incentives ( that pesky economics bit again ) more than anything else - hence market capitalism keeps yielding such superior results compared to anything else . 
  only situations where non-market forces get very good results is where somehow the population is convinced it 's in grave danger - that 's plenty of incentive , but it 's very tough to summon outside war . 
   the basic right tendency is authoritarian , and the basic left tendency is libertarian . 
  i almost 100 % disagree with this and would say that in practice it 's the completely other way around . 
  where i 'm looking from , the left is generally speaking the more authoritarian one while the right would leave people largely alone to govern their affairs . 
   you ca n't have a libertarian right without severe contradictions and problems uh . 
  elaborate a bit on this . 
  i 'd argue that you ca n't do equality of outcomes ( lefts goal ) without severely authoritarian bent . 
  the fact that ideologically the left would prefer not to be authoritarian is meaningless when it 's primary goal absolutely demands an authoritarian approach . 
   equality-libertarianism this , by itself , is a contradiction in terms . 
  you assume that people being free results in people being equals ? 
  that 's really , really , really not the case . 
  free people do n't result in equality . 
  to get that equality , you ca n't be libertarian . 
  the origin was conservatives vs progressives , which is yet another way to view the left-right axis . 
  in a way socialism was the one that confiscated the `` left '' - the united states senate would have certainly sat on the left of that french assembly . 
  what `` theory '' ? 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't really care about what people say . 
  people say all sorts of things , politically minded people in particular . 
  i care about what people ** do ** . 
   the autonomous left , or the anarchists , do n't advocate a totalitarian state like the fascists . 
  if some arsehole is going to beat me , i 'm not sure it 's much of a consolation that in one scenario they 're wearing a uniform and in the other they wo n't be . 
  these guys are about as appealing to me as the nsdap , possibly slightly less so . 
  right-left is ridiculously simplistic . 
  a slightly less simplistic ( but yet simplistic ) is something with two dimensions : x-axis : economic stance ( right-left ) y-axis : attitude to authority bottom left : left wing anti-authoritarians .
