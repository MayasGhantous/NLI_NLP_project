  anarchists are the extreme here , but somewhere in here you might find some genuine ( if perhaps naive ) socialists top left : left wing authoritarians . 
  stalin will be hugging the top here , and quite close to the center here you 're likely to find most of the social democratic parties . 
  bottom right : libertarians . 
  ron paul if you will . 
  republicans in the us try to portray an image like they belonged here , but they do n't act that way . 
  true hardcore libertarians are at the edge here . 
  top right : actual us republicans . 
  most right wing parties in europe . 
  pinochet might be in the corner , but hitler is not really all that far right ( national * socialist * after all ) if you want a third dimension it 'd be international attitude ( exclusive or inclusive ) that 'd help separate people a bit more . 
   as i said , yes , you can defend an authoritarian workplace . 
  but you ca n't if you 're in favour of a democratic system of politics . 
  of course i can . 
  there 's a huge difference : one is a monopoly , the other one is n't . 
  democracy sucks and markets are far better . 
  ie , i dislike the finnish government right now , i shall be ruled by the norwegian one and pay them taxes for now . 
  alas , with governments , monopoly of force etc , this does n't really work . 
  i ca n't live in espoo and swap to the portuguese government because i 'm sick of the finnish one . 
  once there 's a monopoly , the market stops working , and you have no choice . 
  now you have to go for the best of the bad options , which is democracy . 
  you can quit jobs , you can change the supermarket you use etc far , far , far easier than you can change countries . 
  ergo , democracy . 
   then , appearantly , you 're not the run-of-the-mill ceo . 
  actually , i probably am . 
  there are fundamentally 4-5 types of ceos : a ) public company ceo b ) large private company ceo c ) vc backed startup ceo ( i 'm one of these ) d ) sme ceo e ) self financing compaany ceo now , `` a '' are super visible . 
  hell , they are what everyone thinks of when you say `` ceo '' as that 's the cream of the crop . 
  kind of like if you say `` mayor '' , people might think of bloomberg . 
  that does n't change the fact that these people are very , very rare . 
  there might be thousands of people in categories a , b and c globally . 
  maybe even tens of thousands . 
  there are hundreds of thousands in `` d '' and * millions * in e . if you take everyone that runs a company , put their name in a hat and pull one out , you will most likely find someone that runs a restaurant or a hair salon . 
  those are the most common types of company chief execs . 
  the baby is a little in danger of going in down with the bathwater when you 're making decisions about ceos based on what is maybe 0.1 - 1 % of the ceos on the planet ... ( they also are n't responsible for all that much economic output )  about the trickle-down economics thing : because you advocate lower corporate taxes ( or that 's how it seemed ) . 
  corporate taxes do n't imply trickle down in any way . 
  after corporate taxes are paid , none has any money yet - it 's still in the company . 
  i like letting companies invest in things . 
  what you need to control is when people try to move money from companies to people . 
  if i suggested capital gains ( which is the main gatekeeper between corporate profits and individual wealth ) should be removed , now i would be advocating trickle down . 
  i feel capital gains and income taxes should be synced up . 
  hell , in many ways they should be the same thing . 
  then throw in some tax incentives to fund start-ups ( lots of countries have these ) so that taking risks to take on big companies will properly pay off , and voila , you have a pretty decent financial system . 
  once you have your education and people give a shit about your opinion ( something you have to ** deserve ** , the world does n't owe you a fucking thing ) , you 'll discover that employees often have tremendous power inside their organizations , assuming they are capable . 
  you will also discover the astounding differences in productivity between people . 
  now some of this is `` intelligence '' ( however you want to define that ) , but the vast majority is drive . 
  some people are really happy to just have a home and a decent salary , while others really want to change the world . 
  if you 're one of the latter , you can make it happen . 
  and you should . 
  that 's the great thing in the west , anyone and everyone can take a swing at that , and the only things holding you back are : a ) are you capable of doing things ? 
  b ) do you really * want * to do things ? 
  do n't bash the economy too much until you 've actually been there . 
  your information base is deeply flawed and it 's like someone trying to reform universities based on his experiences in kindergarten . 
   we are not saying for there to be no managers or overseers . 
  they can be voted in just as in a democracy hahahahaha . 
  there 's a great example of his in one large organization . 
  i 'm not aware of other large experiments . 
  the red army voted in the lower officer ranks . 
  then they attacked finland in the winter war . 
  curiously enough they got rid of the practice of voting for petty officers after that . 
  weird . 
  it 's like it did n't work very well ? 
   how things are produced , where produced , and what produced decided by the paying customers - the workers nor the ceos have much say about these things , except in trying to guess the overall customer mood . 
  a great ceo is really a `` guesser in chief '' who intuitively can guess what their true boss - the consumers - want . 
  see steve jobs for an example of someone who had a very good instinctive feel for what customers might want . 
   profits i hope you realize all our pensions come from corporate profits ultimately . 
  or pretty much all of them anyway . 
  so if workers take all the profits , there will be no pensions . 
  i also wonder how you 'd treat , say , elon musk or the guy who came up with the dyson vacuum cleaner ( after a long period in purgatory ) . 
  same salary as the janitor or what ? 
   sorry to break it to you but when workers do n't have democratic power in the company they do n't really have a vested interest in those ideas we are actually doing something meaningful and some of us like making the world a better place for its own justification . 
  also , none makes much less than $ 100k at the company , so workplace satisfaction is tied to rather different things than just salary . 
   they could do your job collectively . 
  ** a ** ) i doubt that they even could , but it 's certainly possible ** b ** ) more critically , ** they would n't ** because it 'd involve taking risks that i do n't think any of them would be willing to take  if all the ceos and capitalists vanished tomorrow believe me things would be fine , but if all workers vanished things would go to hell . 
  well duh . 
  if all janitors or farmers vanished tomorrow , we 'd be fine too . 
  or all factory workers . 
  we 're talking percentages of population here . 
  of course a larger chunk will cause more damage . 
  i dislike finance as a profession bit because of the outrageous compensations etc , but i 'm knowledgeable to admit that the chaos that would be caused by all bankers vanishing overnight would be ** insane ** . 
  ditto ceos and capitalists , the epitome which is the ultimate join role : the founder-ceo . 
  to vanish ceos and capitalists both , you 'd have to stop people from founding new companies . 
  i 'd say that this would hit the brakes on human progress incredibly hard . 
  the `` what '' and `` how '' are very intimately linked - you need marketing people who understand ( or rather , whose job it is to understand ) what the market wants . 
  if the answer is x at price y , and price y is impossible at home , then voting about it is just moronic . 
  you have exactly two choices : stop production in your home country and move it abroad or start producing something higher value where your labor expenses wo n't be such a bother ( see : medical equipment , clear majority of which is produced in europe/us/japan even today ) . 
   food , shelter , clean water cool , first 5 % of the employees have been sorted . 
  nice . 
  moving on ...  transportation , education , healthcare , hygienic products and so on lots of choices on how to do it here . 
  also , these keep getting disrupted by new entrepreneurs . 
  or do you think a committee in brussels would have come up with google ? 
  or self driving cars ? 
  or hugely cheaper rockets like spacex ? 
  the list goes on . 
  entrepreneurs are what move this planet forward , and basically we reward them with increased power for their success so they can drive it forward even faster . 
  greatest examples of this around currently are elon musk , larry page and bill gates , all of who are doing so much more with their money than any government ever seems to manage outside wars . 
  government deciding what gets produced is insanity and i would leave a country going for that immediately for one where that was n't a rule , and i 'd do that even if i had to leave every bit of money i have behind . 
  rather a fresh start in a sensible economy than stagnating in a retarded one . 
  unfortunately you 'll find that the vast majority of educated people ( largely engineers ) will do the same , with the rather unfortunate end result that ** if ** you let people move ( ie are not a dictatorship ) , you ' l start descending towards 3rd world status pretty fast if you take direct government/worker control . 
  i 'm really curious what you think the typical worker does these days . 
  i hate to ask for your age , but lets get around that ... are you active in the workforce , and if you are , doing what ? 
  as someone with a computer science degree ( and now a mba ) before i started my company , i did n't feel very much like a peasant to be honest , even though every company i worked for did indeed have a ceo who was making all the decisions . 
   about democratizing the economy - companies are run by a small elite of people .
