  that 's not companies . 
  every human organization ends up run by a small elite of people . 
  there 'll be different types of feedback cycles and ideas bubbling up , but ultimately even a football team of 10 year olds has a hierarchy in it . 
  so nothing special about the economy here . 
   and the interests of the workers are opposite to those of the ceos . 
  what the fuck ? 
  are you nuts ? 
  i ** am ** a ceo . 
  you know what are my actual concerns ? 
  a ) lets make a product customers like b ) lets make it better quality than competitors , and more rugged than competitors c ) lets hope we create enough value for customers that we can get a decent profit for what we do i assure all our workers area very much aligned behind all of these ideas . 
  their salaries are fucking meaningless to me if our product does n't sell . 
  also : if we make a poor enough product that customers refuse to pay a decent price for it , it 's not like their salaries are a choice for me - i ca n't pay with what i do n't have . 
   there really is no way to defend authoritarianism in the workplace except for the fact that authoritarian workplaces are practically always more efficient than non-authoritarian ones . 
  you do realize that anyone can start a non-authoritarian workplace whenever they want . 
  get a group of friends and start a consulting company for example , and you do n't even need titles . 
  awesome . 
  funny thing how none of those stay alive , either going bankrupt or introducing hierarchy . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  all the tens of millions of entrepreneurs in the world are arseholes ? 
   even though the workers do everything fuck you . 
  i 'm in a typical company ( read : founder run ) and i assure you i 've created 10x more value than any employee we 've hired that is n't a major equity holder by now . 
  so no , the workers do not `` do everything '' , that 's just plain wrong . 
   also , you appear to defend trickle down economics . 
  how did you come to that conclusion ? 
  i do not defend trickle down economics in any way . 
  reality is more like `` trickle up '' because it 's the poor who ca n't hold on to their money , whereas the rich can both afford and often are more inclined to saving . 
  oh i get that , but the claim that it 's more democratic that workers ( rather than the far more numerous consumers ) decide what gets produced is ... insanely stupid and deserves to get mocked for that . 
   there was a time when the eu was a free-trade area . 
  i want that eu back . 
  you realize that `` free trade '' does n't really make trade supremely easy ? 
  the whole ** world ** almost is free trade these days . 
  what you want is as much standardization as possible . 
  big meaningful things in this : a ) regulation ( cars , drugs , electrical safety , telecoms etc ) b ) currency c ) financial rules and contract law ( i mean right now everything international just uses english or us law because none wants any surprises with french , german or whoever elses laws ) d ) language ( fuck me but i hate the european market for making me translate in to all these languages - ca n't people just learn english at least to a functional level ? 
  it 's the lingua franca and if you entertain thoughts of being even vaguely educated , you need to speak it ) e ) lack of border bureaucracy ( freedom of travel ) f ) easy access to labor around the eu to tap the potential ( so can work anywhere ) g ) guaranteed peace ( war is bad for most business ) which of these do you most resent ? 
  i mean i like all of them , but i acknowledge there 's a significant amount of stuff that naturally follows from all of that . 
  few contracts wo n't cut it . 
   but the sheer level of bureaucracy was n't i 'm really curious about this actually . 
  only things i 've encountered as a businessman brought by the eu have all been ** reductions ** bureaucracy ( largely in not having to deal with n +1 different sets of rules ) . 
  where 's an actual example of significantly increased regulation ? 
  it 's like this popular bogeyman , but i never seem to actually see it in action . 
   democratize the economy . 
  what does that mean ? 
  spending power is the most widely distributed power among any country - the percentage of people that spend some money during a given week is ... high ... to put it mildly . 
  so it 's democratic in that sense . 
  presumably you mean you 'd like the money to be more evenly spread , as a command economy is really anything but democratic . 
   if the workers collectively ran and managed these companies they never would have left . 
  that 's not democratizing anything , because to allow for this , you 'd have to force everyone to buy potentially more expensive products . 
  so you 're letting , say , 50,000 workers influence the decisions of 50,000,000 buyers . 
  democracy ? 
  far from it . 
   when you hear politicians talking about `` making our country competitive '' all they mean is lowering wages of workers sometimes they do that . 
  what they also mean is creating a good environment for both new `` layman '' companies ( ie hot dog stands etc ) and super high potential companies ( largely dominated by the us , particularly silicon valley ) . 
  for this you need things like education , but also available funding for founders . 
  yes , not the workers , but the founders ( who are the original workers ) . 
  making it as easy as possible for people to come up with a great idea that will end up employing tens of thousands and run with it is a big part of what this discussion is about . 
  as a practical example i 'm a finnish entrepreneur that lives in boston now . 
  why boston ? 
  because everything is cheap ? 
  fuck no , this place is crazy expensive - a coder goes for like $ 100-150k if they 're any good , and silicon valley is even more expensive . 
  reasons : a ) great access to well educated population that has practical experience . 
  there 's tons of great universities here ( harvard & mit are particularly good recruiting grounds ) ** and ** there 's a lot of experience in the workforce of really varied work . 
  b ) funding is much more easily available . 
  oh , they 're more demanding than europe for what we have to do , but if you can manage , there 's tons of money to be had . 
  c ) customers that are more open to start-ups and new companies in general , and certainly none gives a fuck that the company is n't originally american . 
  etc the state of massachusetts has some big projects to stay competitive with $ 1bn being pumped in to particularly life sciences ecosystem . 
  improving all high schools chemistry/biology classes even further ( ma has some of the best education in the us already , perfectly comparable to the likes of finland ) etc. 
  that 's an example of how to `` increase competitiveness '' . 
   lowering corporate tax rates to entice capitalists to invest there the corporate taxes should n't be all that high ultimately , but it 's crazy that it 's a zero sum game in europe . 
  if there 's a tax that should be europe wide , it should be corporate tax , which then in turn could fund all of eu . 
  this would stop the silly jumping around of companies . 
  still , it really should be in the 20-30 % range and no higher . 
   the profit motive which is the central drive in capitalism will lead to the third worldization of western countries it led to any country becoming first world , so i would n't go there . 
  the profit motive is the biggest driver for progress in human history . 
  market capitalism is like fire . 
  i agree with you that if left unguarded it 's a bad thing . 
  your declaration that humanity should give up fire and just go without strikes me as utter lunacy though . 
   we have to start discussing post capitalist economic systems . 
  we are n't leaving capitalism behind for a long time , possibly never . 
  however , it will get layered with more things . 
  possible a capitalism resting on top of a baseline communist society . 
  in other words - a level of living is guaranteed to everyone , but on top of that , go wild . 
  get a private spaceplane for yourself , why not ? 
   because a prussian has had much more in common with a franconian than a bulgarian has with a brit . 
  yes but this is just a question of relevant distances which ultimately comes down to speed of travel , interconnectedness and communication . 
  the prussian and franconian did n't need to care about each other when a typical resident of either would probably never travel as far as the other was . 
  eventually they did , but now they discovered language barriers and bulgarian and britain were both still very far . 
  however , nowadays the `` far away '' places are more like indonesia , namibia and bolivia . 
  in the previously `` far away '' regions like a finn in spain or a bulgarian in scotland , the odds are extremely good that you can get there with your free cash flows from a single month of work ** and ** you know a language with which to converse with tons of locals in ( if not all or at least the majority ) . 
  the world keeps changing . 
  i personally have now lived in 3 countries , and i ca n't claim any particular affinity to the average person in my home country compared to the other two . 
  frankly , i suspect the * region * i live in has a lot more in common than the countries ( espoo finland --  oxford , uk --  boston , usa ) . 
  perhaps had i gone to newcastle or birmingham , alabama , my experience would have been more jarring . 
  we 're like an au naturel version of netherlands . 
  i doubt that . 
  there 's like 50 million people in the us with german ancestry today , and that number was surely lower in 1914 , while germany alone had a population of closer to 70 million . 
  throw in austria , northern switzerland and the german diaspora in the pale and we 're surely talking 100 million in europe compared to maybe 25-30 in north america . 
  they speak english just fine , so no reason to start swapping languages just because of them . 
  finland also contributes roughly a similar amount per capita as germany so i 'm sure we 're a beneficiary too , even if one in need of more reforms right now than germany . 
  i 'll agree that a joint eu military ( which might in turn be allied with the us ) would be better than nato , but none seems to be pushing hat very seriously , which leaves nato . 
  first of all making the benefits explicit is good .
