  second of all i personally dislike freeloading , and that includes on the national level . 
  thirdly i think finland and sweden joining would seriously upgrade the defensibility of the baltic 's , who are in some actual danger . 
  a nice thing for sure . 
  also once russia realized there was nothing to be done there ( surely they can not imagine finland is some how in the sphere of their pathetic yet big kleptocracy ) , perhaps their delusions of grandeur would diminish some . 
  i also would extend a major olive branch after particularly finland joined , to make it clear that russia need not be opposed to all of this unless it wants to . 
  i do so dislike unemployment rates ever after i discovered the `` employment rate '' . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/employment-to-population_ratio this is far , far , far more interesting , as there are very few numbers government game more aggressively than the unemployment number . 
  ( i also find these numbers fascinating as they really go quite strongly against the legend of the hard working americans - the employment percentage advantage iceland has over the us is 13.1 % ( !!! ), 
  and even bigger countries like germany can have a 5.8 % lead in total employment . 
  as a german you should know better than most . 
  being 18 years old , pick a year : 1914 , 1939 , 2014 . 
  i mean , you might have to go on one of those peacekeeping missions , so maybe 2014 is not the no-brainer i think it should be . 
  not really a realistic option . 
  or when there 's been no hegemon , there 's typically war . 
  yet the reasons often used for hating jews were roughly correct . 
  due to the vatican 's attitude towards usury , the original bankers were jewish . 
  so the jewish banker demanding what you owe him is really a perfectly accurate historical stereotype ( not included in the picture : the christian person that took a loan they could not pay back ) . 
  with that in mind i see no reason to assume the roma stereotype of petty crime is n't accurate as well . 
  nope . 
  tech . 
  the $ 1.75 m salary guy is ( in the greatest surprise of all time ) in finance . 
  yeah . 
  going back to finland from the us can be weird . 
  now i think that a $ 250k salary is not a particularly big deal , and i have friends ( low 30s ) that make up to $ 1.75 m in ** salary ** . 
  finland is wealthy , but everyone boggles even at the $ 250k which is not considered a particularly big deal at least in boston . 
   a german would tell another german that he sucks , but never accept criticism from an italian without trying to retaliate and divert from the point made . 
  you seem half-accepting of a finnish scolding of how you soft southerners can be so lazy . 
  it 's all that sun and warmth i think , people just do n't work that hard in such a cozy environment . 
  i actually lived for quite a while in south east england ( oxford / london ) , and i found the multiculturalism particularly in oxford pretty nice . 
  the uk and france have it going to a degree . 
  not as well as the us , but ** far ** above and beyond what countries like finland can manage . 
  still , i think the only real thing that has to get sorted is the issue of language . 
  once english is truly universal inside the eu , we can get so much further . 
  knowing english does not make one english or even an anglophile , but rather creates a common ground for discussion and allows for greater movement of talent across borders , which will allow us to get more comfortable with each other . 
  i am getting this strange impression you do n't know about the tesla s. 
  i 'd look in to it in a bit more european context . 
  the only real problem i can see is language really . 
  if eu were to have a military , it 'd need to speak english , because that 's what is readily available in all the populations . 
  so if germany wanted to grow europe 's muscle in a very peaceful way that all the countries in europe could embrace ( and which would be a huge economic boon to particularly southern and eastern europe ) ... ** step 1 ** : bring english in as a language german military operates in alongside german ( this not unprecedented in any way , finnish military has units operating primarily in swedish ) . 
  ** step 2 ** : start some `` rapid reaction '' forces for europe . 
  they will be funded by individual nations to begin with and wave their flags ( in this case germany ) , but there 's a clear idea that they are for the eu at large . 
  ** step 3 ** : open recruitment to those units or at least some of them from anywhere inside the eu . 
  it 'd still be a german unit , but it might be 50 % or more foreign , and it 'd speak english . 
  ** step 4 ** : locate the units and their bases at the `` frontiers '' of europe , or near them , rather than in germany . 
  by this i mean poland , romania , finland but perhaps also spain this would bring europe together a great deal more . 
  it would certainly make out defense feel a great deal more robust ** and ** it would stimulate the economies around those bases quite nicely ( like the us has done with its bases ) . 
  if the english speaking units were working out , i would n't be shocked if some countries would elect to merge their militaries with the german military ( with some neat `` eu military '' flag flowing ) . 
  why ? 
  because their military is not in a position to win any battles they 're likely to have to fight . 
  estonia ? 
  unless latvia attacks , they 're fucked anyway . 
  if the units there are eu troops ? 
  different thing . 
  this would be the easiest way to a european military . 
  the stronger countries that are n't under threat would keep independent militaries potentially indefinitely , but i can imagine many that would n't . 
  i would absolutely disagree . 
  only military that does n't become dangerous is one that 's built from the citizenry . 
  it needs to be intermingled with society as much as possible , but with a light enough touch that it 's the society that dominates the military rather than vice versa ( looking at you , prussia ) . 
  mercenaries are the worst possible idea i could come up with . 
  yea it is insanely patronizing of him to think that the eastern europeans have no opinion or say in this . 
  why would latvia need to give a duck about what russia wants near its borders ? 
   people want to live , he said , in `` a giant switzerland . '' this rings all too true . 
  and in a way it 's good . 
  a huge player in the global economy which just plain resists the use of force is a very good thing . 
  that being said , i would like germany to have a bigger military budget , while keeping the current attitude . 
  and a lot of people find the inefficiency of european military spending in a way more annoying because of the eu . 
  if there was no eu it 'd just be a fact of life that military spending per power gained would be quite high because there are limited economies of scale for big things like aircraft carriers . 
  with the eu however , we could have a budget on a scale that would allow us to create a military that would be comparable to the us . 
  who wants to waste money half-arseing it all when you know that going all the way is fairly viable . 
  ( and i know we have lots of joint weapon programs , but they just do n't seem quite the same ), 
  with the russian navy in the state it is in and all the issues being so deep in eastern europe , i 'm not really sure why the us would have any aircraft carriers in the atlantic . 
  finland reasonably strong , insanely stubborn and pretty fucking spiteful . 
  knowing the national character ( and what the geography does to for example air power ) , i think as russia i 'd rather try occupying afghanistan again . 
  only reason i doubt finns would suicide bomb is because after that one bombing you would n't get to kill more of the bastards . 
  i assure you that plan will have some major unknowns in it if they decide to `` take '' finland . 
  our geography works very well for us ( this might not be obvious from looking at a world map ... zoom closer and then use street view ) and the military is defensively really quite capable, 
  maybe it 's time to start fixing that . 
  military spend can be a good stimulus and there is a clear disruption in military development coming . 
  develop an air superiority drone or something . 
  if they have no interest in poland , why would they care about us troops there ? 
  and if you say spheres of influence i will , as someone from a country sharing a long border with russia , to kindly go fuck yourself, 
  hard to tell . 
  a lot of chinese are moving money to london because it 's a nice safe haven that the chinese government wo n't be able to bully particularly much ( zurich too ) . 
  certainly singapore is still a little unnervingly close ( and it has competition from the likes of hong kong , tokyo and shanghai ) . 
  like i said , on the inside we might be able to influence something . 
  perhaps coordinate the eu nato countries somewhat . 
  finland needs to grow up from pouting on the sidelines . 
  if we are a core part of europe ( i think we are ) , we should start taking some responsibility . 
  a major part of that comes from being there when the hard decisions are being done . 
  i 'm very proud of what we 're doing with the eu already , but i think we should also sit at the nato table . 
  the problem - in my opinion - is super fundamental in russia . 
  if you build a multi-billion euro company in us , europe , japan , korea , australia , wherever , none can really just take it from you . 
  you have power , you have personal security etc. 
  if anything , a little too much . 
  in russia , particularly if you have a liberal bent , you 'd always have to fear the government which has shown that it can whimsically do pretty much whatever . 
  this creates a game where you have to corrupt to government just to protect yourself . 
  if you 're not friends with the kremlin , you might end up as an enemy without realizing it . 
  this is supremely unhealthy and it drives a lot of ambitious people away i think . 
  it 's also really deeply embedded now . 
  china is much better than russia in this , but even they have a huge problem with people preferring to get their assets out ( or if possible , to even create them outside as much as possible while ideally tapping some internal resources ) .
