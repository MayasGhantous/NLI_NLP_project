  and from helsinki [ suomenlinnan panimo ] ( http://www.panimo.com/etusivu.html ) are great . 
  i think you 're making a bigger deal out of nato membership than it really is . 
  finland buys and sells weapons and ships to nato countries just fine all the time . 
  i do n't know where you got the 30 + figure but i do n't think anyone in finland is talking about that much . 
  even just a couple would be a plus for us . 
  free competition would be in us taxpayers interest in this case . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.hs.fi/talous/a1441169236712 ) story ( in finnish ) , the finnish government has been trying to sell icebreakers to the us for decades . 
  this has been impossible due to us protectionism called the jones act , which dictates that all vessels that travel from american port to another american port must be built in the us . 
  even though finnish icebreakers would cost around 150 million vs 500 million for one made in the us . 
  pretty crazy if you ask me . 
  a long fascinating read into google 's regulatory struggles in the eu . 
  i admit to being a google lover , but i think it is necessary to regulate their ability to use their dominant position in search to their advantage in other markets . 
  i 'm glad we 've got a woman like vestager on the job . 
  she seems competent , unbiased and fair to me . 
  i just visited st. petes for a week month ago and to me this feels very realistic in light of what is saw there . 
  a lot of people on this sub would do well to go and see for themselves . 
  i have an entry level programming job . 
  i make 2500 $ / month . 
  i pay 700 in rent in helsinki for a small single room . 
  150-200 for food . 
  50-100 on transportation . 
  20 $ for internet , 15 $ for mobile , 10 $ for electricity . 
  the rest goes towards saving for an apartment . 
  and travelling/drinking/fun . 
  i feel like if i made a 1000 $ more then i could really live comfortably in finland . 
  thankfully that 's not a tall order in it . 
  also does n't show offshore wind potential . 
  in finland there are several offshore windparks underway . 
  it 's not dying . 
  in fact our ship building is doing quite well under new management . 
  new cruise ship orders and new ice breakers for the arctic are under construction and more are in the pipe . 
  forestry is n't stagnating either . 
  there was just a billion euro investment to a new biofactory and several similar projects planned . 
  we built almost everything out of wood so fires have destroyed much that is old . 
  the war destroyed yet more and in the 60s and 70s much of was torn down to make way for modern buildings . 
  we 've lost so much it really amounts to a cultural catastrophe . 
  more examples of nice old towns and villages : old rauma : [ 1 ] ( http://www.matkaopas.info/wp-content/uploads/rauma-vanha-rauma.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.matkaopas.info/wp-content/uploads/rauma-kirche.jpg ) fiskars village : [ 1 ] ( https://meanwhileinlongfield.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/fiskars3.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://fiskarsv.asiakkaat.sigmatic.fi/sites/default/files/kuvat/diat/fiskarsruukki_www_ylakuva_1180x375_citikka.jpg ) naantali : [ 1 ] ( http://www.nymander.com/images/2000s/kunnat/2006_07_vk3_b_11_naantali/img_9214.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.discoveringfinland.com/ftp/naantali/arto_takala-main.jpg ), 
  i hope russians never lose their knack for doing brilliant shit like this . 
  we 've got problems indeed . 
  massive wage increases in 2007 that destroyed competitiveness , decline of forestry and mobile phone business , decline in trade with russia , feckless government , lagging economy in the eurozone and rapidly decreasing workforce to list a few ... 
  it 's amazing how fast everything has gone down the toilet . 
  parliamentary elections are in two weeks . 
  hopefully we 'll get an effective government . 
  we desperately need to get reforms passed . 
  it 's not really known what the etymology of korhonen is . 
  deaf is one possibility based on a dialect of one region but it could also mean : elder , proud , rich , someone who walks with their head held high or someone with curly hair to name a few ( source : finnish wikipedia ) . 
  i think you know the answer to that . 
  says rt. . . any other sources ? 
  that 's really cool !, 
  i 'll definitely make a beer run on that once it starts running . 
  that is a long ass time to wait when the americans are lading rockets and reusing them right now . 
  looks pretty cool , but when is arianespace going to start developing rockets that can land ? 
  seems like that 's where the industry is going and if europe want 's to stay competitive in the launch business it 's going to have to come up with a reusable rocket . 
  i think your 're right , but speculating about russian action is cool , because it 's unpredictable enough that anything can conceivably happen !, 
  the article is definitely talking about groups . 
  in plural . 
  they have n't been caught . 
  the police interviewed in the article states that you need about 50 policemen to make them leave . 
  so i guess they do n't even try to arrest them . 
  yeah that sub is awful . 
  anyone know of any quality alternatives ? 
  i never thought i 'd say this but i hope we leave this bullshit currency . 
  none of the euros flaws have been fixed since the start of the crisis and it does n't look like they 're about to any time soon . 
  i 'm sorry too . 
  i was being a dick , but i think it would be best for the eu to have britan in to counter french statism and german corporatism , and i think it would be best for britain 's influence in the world to stay . 
  finnish has too many vowel , polish has too many consonants . 
  we should really combine them to create ponnish : a perfect language . 
  in my country the government is hurriedly trying to pass a law that would pardon tax evaders from any legal consequences beside paying the taxes they owe . 
  they are doing this to rescue the elite in the country because information exchange between countries is set to improve in the coming years and the tax evaders would be caught anyway . 
  with proposals like this and the tax evansion tzar juncker holding the highest office in the eu it really feels like the elite is in conspiracy ... makes me feel like we should just burn this shit down and start fresh . 
  in finland there is also a kind of traditional beer kalled [ sahti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahti ) , same as the pink sami word . 
  also in spoken language [ kalja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjpah21kvz0 ) is the most commonly used word for beer . 
  no idea about the etymology of that though . 
  why is it so fucked up though ? 
  i would say there are some legitimate concerns related to privacy considering american tech giants co-operation with mass surveillance by the american government . 
  these days your whole live is basically on your phone : where you been , who you talk to , who you are friends with etc. 
  i would say plurality in smart phone operating systems can only be a good thing . 
  the sailfishos is a pretty decent platform to base their os on . 
  in the end it all comes down to the ecosystem i suppose . 
  the real question is what is their strategy on building that ecosystem ? 
  i think climate might really have something to do with proritising housing first . 
  maybe milder climes allow officials to ignore homelessness more easily since people are n't dying from cold . 
  i remember headlines about people dying in central europe during cold snaps . 
  if finland had significant homelessness that would be a yearly occurrence . 
  i assume the other nordic countries also rank well on this area . 
  geography is destiny on some level afterall . 
  on a clear day you can see the alps from on top of that hill . 
  quite a nice view !, 
  saint nicholas was from the area of modern turkey so turks could say santa comes from there . 
  say 's a lot about islam , that this is what they chose to do instead . 
  yes wages are negotiated by union per industry . 
  the smallest wages can be under 10 $ in some industries though , but there is an effective minimun wage of about 9 $ i believe . 
  too bad all the pictures of finland are uninteresting crap . 
  there are defiantely better photo subjects in here than [ this ] ( http://allthingseurope.tumblr.com/post/32522017292 ) seriously guys :|, 
  i do n't have any experience of the romanian system or the swedish one but i have experience of the finnish system and french system a little . 
  in finland you have to apply to get to university so it 's not a free for all but otherwise it 's probably pretty close to the swedish one . 
  in france i studied at a engineering grand \u00e9cole . 
  the grands \u00e9coles are universities that choose their students through tests unlike universities in the regular university network , and they are somewhat elitist . 
  how i perceived the french system was that it did indeed demand a lot more work than the finnish system . 
  in finland the beginner level courses tend to be almost trivially easy to pass .
