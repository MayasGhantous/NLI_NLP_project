i spent a year studying in a high school in queensland at 2007 . 
  i got used to the heat fast since i found the classroom air conditioning and near-zero winter temperatures too cold . 
  on the other hand in finland we do n't walk to school in t-shirts and shorts during the winter . 
  back in early 2000 when we still had analogue tv broadcasts , estonian tv3 was watchable in finland during clear weather . 
  there was this soap opera that was dubbed by a single person with a manly voice . 
  he did also the female parts , which was hilarious . 
  i do n't like coffee , but i love stouts and porters flavoured with coffee . 
  i like that `` ei talvikunnossapitoa '' ( `` no winter maintenance '' ) sign ; ), 
  i thought to let people figure that out ; ), 
  hufvud = head in old swedish ( currently huvud ) , stads = city 's , bladet = paper, 
  not retarded , but `` special '', 
  in finland , many flavoured yoghurts can contain over 10 grams of sugar per 100 grams of product . 
  there 's a lake in ontario named [ lake poikkimaki ] ( https://www.lakepedia.com/lake/poikkimaki.html ) . 
  poikkim\u00e4ki is a finnish surname , and [ 4 canadian finnish soldiers named poikkim\u00e4ki ] ( http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/emi3d48ce.htm ) who lived in ontario served in world war ii . 
  i think not !, 
  ** her *, 
  and `` tortillat avataan '' !, 
  at least i was amazed the first time i encountered a mormon speaking well understandable finnish ( with an accent of course ) . 
  they must have put a lot of effort into learning finnish . 
  i think most finns would be amazed as well . 
  not offended , i find it funny too . 
  example in its native habitat : https://youtu.be/wqqhqsbe6fw?t=16, 
   ... cut off public access to the thirteenth floor , or otherwise ` omit ' this floor . 
  are there really buildings that have empty and/or unused floor ( s ) just because of superstition ? 
  what a waste that would be . 
  our current president [ plowed snow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5cgra3/current_president_of_finland_the_next_day_after/ ) the day after his election . 
  i 'm surprised how correctly [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/mit%c3%a4%20tarkoitat%2c%20ett%c3%a4%20suomen%20kielen%20oppiminen%20on%20vaikeaa%20natiivim...%20natiiveimme...%20natiiveimmillek%c3%a4%c3%a4n%20suomalaisille%3f ) translates that into english . 
  none . 
  kotimaisten means domestic ( `` centre of domestic languages '' is the direct translation ) . 
  and yes , finland is suomi in finnish . 
  [ kotimaisten kielten keskus ] ( https://www.kotus.fi/ ) , institute for the languages of finland , which maintains finnish and swedish , and coordinates the maintenance of sami , sign and romani languages . 
  sriracha , but i put it * next * to my chips to avoid the chips going mushy . 
  edit : sriracha ketchup is awesome too !, 
  i studied at high school ( exchange ) for a year in australia , near brisbane . 
  [ makaronivelli ] ( https://www.myllynparas.fi/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/vanhanajan%20makaronivelli.jpg ) . 
  it 's made by cooking milk , macaroni ( elbow variety ) and wheat flower ( optional ) together . 
  it 's usually seasoned with salt , and a bit of butter as `` voisilm\u00e4 '' ( butter eye ) . 
  i like porters and stouts best . 
  probably the best one i 've tasted is [ naga jolokia imperial porter ] ( https://untappd.com/b/pyynikin-kasityolaispanimo-naga-jolokia-imperial-porter/1686297 ) by pyynikin k\u00e4sity\u00f6l\u00e4ispanimo ( from tampere , finland ) . 
  another great one is [ imperial stout ] ( https://untappd.com/b/samuel-smith-old-brewery-imperial-stout/14 ) by samuel smith 's ( from england ) . 
  although i 'm a finn , i do n't like coffee as a coffee , but i really like coffee in beer . 
  maybe not the best but one of my favourites , kummeli . 
  they have few sketch comedies in english : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0qhjmuhrzo . 
  with raisins of course !, 
  i like more of [ these direct translations ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/gclrf ) than the original ones . 
  one of my favourite is missing : putosi kuin eno veneest\u00e4 ( fell like mother 's brother from a boat ) : to be left behind , to lose your seat/place . 
  they do n't like to be in sauna with me ( or come in when i 'm in there ) , for some reason ( even when not throwing l\u00f6yly ) , but they do like to lay down even on the top bench when the sauna is heating up to 70 \u00b0 c or cooling down . 
  they go to the floor or just come out when they are feeling too warm . 
  [ i have two sauna cats ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gk5wa9q.png ), 
  i have n't seen those before : o have to try them !, 
  we have actually 4 weird flavours : - hernekeitto ( pea soup ) - viina ( vodka/booze ) - teline ( scaffold , singular ) - johannes ( male name ) just kidding , this is from a finnish short film [ kanava omega ] ( https://youtu.be/ikyz5igalle?t=109 ) ( won assembly '04 short film competition ) . 
  ** but !, 
  ** we really do have chips called [ kaikilla mausteilla ] ( https://www.realsnacks.fi/tuotteet/kaikilla-mausteilla ) ( with all spices/flavours ) . 
  they are flavoured with ketchup , mustard , onion , pickle relish , chili and probably garlic . 
  did i forget something ? 
  in finnish grills ( the ones you go late at night after a bar ) , it 's common to have your food ( especially [ makkaraperunat ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/makkaraperunat ) ) `` kaikilla mausteilla '' , which includes most of the incredients listed above . 
  in finnish it 's maksalaatikko ( lit . 
  `` liver box '' ) . 
  i usually eat [ prepared ones ] ( http://www.saarioinen.fi/tuote/maksalaatikko-400-g/ ) that can be just microwaved , with raisins of course ; ) . 
  the one behind the link has a mix of pork 's , beef 's and chicken 's liver . 
  [ m\u00e4mmi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a4mmi ) , a finnish easter pudding made from rye ( dessert ) . 
  in finland it 's called [ aladobi ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/aladobi ) or syltty . 
  in finland some workplaces also have no shoes policy . 
  not sure how common this is , but i 'd say it 's more common in smaller companies , such as the one i work in ( 10 people ) . 
  for example , supercell is one of those companies : http://www.businessinsider.com/supercells-no-shoes-policy-2013-11, 
  if you click the `` advanced '' button , it says :  mykyc.andbank.es uses an invalid security certificate . 
  the certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown . 
  the server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates . 
  an additional root certificate may need to be imported . 
  error code : sec_error_unknown_issuer, 
  not sure how official it is , but [ puukko ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/puukko ) is also one . 
  and after that the teacher would ask each one of us , one at a time , '' \u00c7a va ? '', 
  and we would respond '' \u00c7a va ( bien/mal ) . '', 
  [ whispered ] ( http://www.whisperedband.com/ ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpipy8sqvhu, 
  max payne series ( 1 and 2 ) or alan wake . 
  afaik max payne 3 was fully developed by rockstar games and therefore it is n't finnish ( sadly ) . 
  if it has to have chocolate , then it 's [ salmiakki chocolate ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/product_info.php?cpath=24_36&amp;products_id=2104 ) !, 
  few years ago i shared an apartment with a high school friend while studying at university of applied sciences . 
  usually we woke up at the same time , about 30 mins before leaving , and walked to the school together for another 30 mins . 
  some mornings we said nothing to each other ( at least not before we got to the school ) . 
  [ santa claus village ] ( http://www.santaclausvillage.info/ ), 
  salmiakkivodka ( salmiakki koskenkorva as a brand ), 
  stores selling alcohol before 9 and after 21 . 
  joulupukki , the original finnish `` father christmas '' :  joulupukki , literally `` yule goat '' , donned horns and an animal hide and covered his face with soot or a bark mask . 
  he travelled from house to house frightening children with his wild dancing and singing , and expected offerings of food and booze . 
   the form this christmas-time character took varied greatly in different parts of the country . 
  according to some versions of the legend he also brought sticks with which to whip naughty children . 
  stingy households suffered the goat 's insults . 
  the quote is from [ here ] ( http://www.rense.com/general60/sant.htm ) , and [ here ] ( https://mesikammen.wordpress.com/tag/nuuttipukki/ ) are some drawings from an old story book . 
  edit : translations for the book pages ( since google translate did a poor job ) :  ( 1 ) joulupukki guards the skulls of children taken as hunting trophies . 
  some sources state that [ korvatunturi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korvatunturi ) grew from the pile . 
   ( 2 ) joulupukki of old times did n't spare the whip . 
   ( 3 ) nuuttipukki was one of the guests of [ st. knuts day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._knut%27s_day ) . 
  nuuttipukki is a scary looking man wearing horns . 
  another man might have acted as the rear legs of nuuttipukki . 
  the tradition is believed to have started among [ lapps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_people ) , in which a horned character has been known for hundreds of years . 
  children were usually afraid of nuuttipukki . 
   ( 4 ) alkupukki ( `` primeval pukki '' ) collects food for the winter . 
   ( 5 ) old time joulupukki by his yule cauldron . 
   ( 6 ) ancient joulupukki has catched a reindeer for food .
