yes . 
  we need it for ... errrmmm ... things . 
  russians have tried to take it from us many times . 
  but now there 's no one stopping us from doing ... \u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 ... things . 
  packages have to be treatred the same way . 
  why would you want more latency for example to your video games or cloud service , because youtube or some other big company has paid to your operator to prioritze their packages higher . 
  the article did n't state the political views of the pilot or even his name . 
  belgium can finnish . 
  ha en upp vote . 
  if you need a fourth group there 's plenty of room in ours . 
  +12 c sounds like spring .

  finns are n't just used to cheap alcohol . 
  i believe it 'd take a while for the consumption get back to normal if they lower taxes . 
  [ the tax was lowered 2004 and after that the consumption increased ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/alkoholivero#alkoholivero_ja_kansanterveys ) , but now [ the consumption has been going down ] ( https://www.thl.fi/fi/tilastot/tilastot-aiheittain/paihteet-ja-riippuvuudet/alkoholi/alkoholijuomien-kulutus ) for a while already ( since something like 2007 ) . 
  it 's useless .

  thanks for the advice , i did that on their website . 
  i have it from sonera , i 've had it for year or two . 
  it something called `` sonera sopiva j\u00e4tti '' they do n't seem to sell that anymore . 
  romans did have parts of greece a little bit before 100 bc . 
  so they could have brought lions from there aswell . 
  there is even a [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_lions_in_europe ) about the european lions . 
  i have a plan with a data cap here in finland . 
  i pay around 20 euros for 50 gigabytes of data transfer on 4g and unlimited calls and sms ' . 
  those do n't apply if i travel to another country though . 
  i went to a bar/pub then . 
  i might have also bought a cheese , but it could 've been a lager aswell . 
  ca n't really remember much about that . 
  i agree . 
  around 15 years ago when i was 10 or 11 years old . 
  i remember going to a cheese store in estonia and just bought some random cheese that looked good . 
  it was one best cheeses i 've bought . 
  everytime i 've gone to estonia i 've bought cheese and meat products . 
  last time i bought some meat products i was dissapointed . 
  same stuff as in other nordic countries and with a little bit of reading the labels and googling i found out that the brands were owned by h&k and atria which are one of the biggest brands in finland . 
  in some places it does so closer to the autumn .

  maahinen is some sort of an evil small human like creature , which lives underground and might change a human child ( especially one that does n't behave/is rude or evil ) to their one of their own . 
  what is this chest hair people are talking about ? 
  edit . 
  i found those , there are three . 
  norway ? 
  i 'd say there 's still some mistrust towards russians left from the russian rule and from the soviet attempts to take our indepence . 
  the mistrust towards russian people is slowly fading , but people do n't trust the federation of russia . 
  university student here . 
  earth , no and mostly . 
  it 's because the language has vowel harmony , so if it 'd be one word t\u00e4ll\u00e4inen would be correct , but t\u00e4llainen derives from t\u00e4m\u00e4nlainen , which is why it does n't follow the vowel harmony . 
  there are too many cats on the internet . 
  go away stupid bot . 
  we do n't have one , but our neighbor has the knugen gustaf who has a great taste in hats . 
  i do that on europa universalis iv . 
  `` ah , lithuania declared a war on me , austria will probably take care of that , i 'm gon na continue to conquer south america before portugal does . '', 
  he was asking whether i find the pronounciation or the grammar harder . 
  in which case the grammar is harder for me . 
  it 's relatively easy for me to pronounce estonian ( because it is written the way it is spoken ) , but knowing right words and proper suffixes to use is harder . 
  the grammar is harder . 
  we have a lot of words that are almost the same and then some that are similar but have a different meaning . 
  in estonian ( and in finnish ) you can always pronounce the word if you see it written as long as you know how to pronounce different letters . 
  estonians have letter o\u0303 which is quite hard for me to pronounce , but all the other sounds are found in finnish aswell . 
  some letters have different pronounciation for example estonian d would be short t in finnish . 
  finnish is my native language and i have studied english , swedish and german + some words/sentences from other languages . 
  i can somewhat understand estonian , norwegian , written danish and written dutch . 
  i 'm not sure whether include estonian into that list since i 've learned some sentences ( ma tahaksin \u00fcks pileti ostab , ait\u00e4h . ), 
  and try to read the estonian subreddit every now and then . 
  i still hear those every first monday of the month at noon . 
  it depends where you live . 
  at least i 've heard those in vantaa and tampere . 
  the school systems are very different from country to a country , i think ours is somewhat similar to german or swedish system . 
  peruskoulu ( basic school ) 9 years --  lukio ( gymnasium ) or ammattikoulu ( vocational school ) 3-4 years --  yliopisto ( university ) or ammattikorkeakoulu ( university of applied sciences ), 
  the temperature in scotland does n't change as much , because it 's surrounded by sea . 
  swedish cold can be under -20 c. ( wikipedia says scotland has coldest ever temperature of -27,3 c while sweden has had -52,6 . 
  for highest ever temperatures sweden : +38 , scotland +32,9 ), 
  i do n't follow uk politicians or what they say , but i agree with my neighbour here . 
  these are in sami language . 
  i 'd like to see quidditch become more popular . 
  the length of the day during winter . 
  20h of the day is darkness and the other 4 is a bit less dark . 
  nice flags you both have , but the colours are off . 
  how about hexadecimal ? 
  it 'd have 16 different numbers , even better than 12 . 
  we have a small amount left here in finland . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/aarniomets%c3%a4#suomen_aarniomets.c3.a4t ) says that less than 5 % of finlands forests are untouched . 
  ( although 77 % percent of finlands land area is considered as forest ), 
  for most of the people those do n't have any importance . 
  but there might be some laws which concern certain areas . 
  at least in lapland there are special laws related to reindeer herding . 
  one being that you are n't allowed to ask for compensation if reindeers damage your forests . 
  it is easier to trade with the same currency and the euro is more stable compared to having own currency . 
  the value of the money stays about the same even if there are some events that would otherwise have a greater impact to economy of a single country . 
  generally we follow the rules quite well , but when there 's an empty gravel road many of us turn into rally drivers . 
  last time was 17.6.2016 when a police officer was deliberately shot and died . 
  there 's been two occasions on this millennium when a police officer has died while they 've been working .
