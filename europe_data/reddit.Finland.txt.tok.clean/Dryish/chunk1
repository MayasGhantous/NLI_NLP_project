[ there are 1.5 million to 2 million muslims living in moscow ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/moscow-largest-muslim-city-europe-faithful-face-discrimination-public-authorities-2020858 ) , so a mosque is not * that * remarkable over there . 
  this is just putin grandstanding to show that , in contrast to europe , he 's not afraid of islam , and that he 's willing to respect his muslim allies in the middle east . 
  it ... does n't work that way , though ? 
  it 's only a switcharoo if the two subjects or objects are deliberately changed to make a joke . 
  i honestly do n't count the baltics as eastern european countries for some strange reason that i ca n't even place myself . 
  maybe it 's because you guys ( estonians especially \u2665 ) are n't slavs . 
  oh it 's that way around , okay . 
  sorry , i was trying to remember the linked.in profile details from memory and got it wrong . 
  ~ ~ jeff is a polish guy who studied in australia . ~ ~ edit : see post below for actual details . 
  aalto for economics and computer sciences , lappeenranta for engineering , helsinki for everything else basically ( although turku has a highly regarded faculty of medicine and tampere allegedly excels in movies and television as well as political science ) . 
  the netherlands is also not very strictly a catholic country . 
  `` we knew the company would not be the same . 
  few employees cried , few employees laughed . 
  most employees were silent . 
  ceo aydin was quoted saying ' i am become generosity , the distributor of wealth . ' '', 
  i 've read balkan ghosts by kaplan . 
  it 's a fantastic book that explains a lot of each balkan country 's history while also recounting kaplan 's own experiences traveling through the region and interacting with all kinds of people from regular townsfolk to politicians and separatist fighters . 
  much recommended to anyone who wishes to understand balkans a bit better , there 's really a lot of vital information in that book . 
  or at least that 's how it seemed to an uneducated outsider . 
  they 've already mostly retired , actually . 
  the biggest age group is the one that is 70 right now , so the big `` pension bomb '' is already here . 
  we 're just not feeling it quite yet because the age groups still slightly below the retirement age are not significantly smaller , but give it five years and the amount of people paying taxes relative to the amount of people receiving benefits from the state looks much worse . 
  i 'm ... in finland and i ca n't watch that . 
  what the ? 
  would you if i told you to do the same , though ? 
   delete your account behave . 
  what do you think you achieve by insulting him ? 
  i guess the danish and swedish periods left a lot of north germanic dna there that you guys never got as much of . 
  estonia 's population was n't very high a thousand years back . 
  hint : it 's not . 
  we 've just been scared of the american gm food producer monopoly for decades . 
  scary ? 
  finland ? 
  i. . . what ? 
  finn here , polish people being simple and a little stupid is an existing stereotype . 
  although , that may just be the stereotype we have of all slavs over here . 
  but not the school shootings ? 
  curious . 
  we had a terror attack or two ? 
  when and why was i not informed ? 
   anyone who could potentially cause harm so , in other words , everyone ? 
  hate to nitpick , but there 's probably a better definition out there . 
  so is this an actual photograph or an in-game shot from the witcher 3 ? 
  when ` entrepreneurship literally discouraged ' finland gets the seventh place , you know your index is a little bizarre . 
  do n't look at me , i 've always called it eesti . 
  in more detail : ` alanko ' means ' a lowland ' , ` maa ' means ' a land ' or ' a country ' . 
  ` maat ' is the plural nominative of the word ` maa ' . 
  so literally , ` lowland lands ' -- netherlands . 
  * hollanti * is also used interchangeably , but it 's getting phased out since we have finally discovered what dutch people not from holland feel about getting called hollanders . 
   estonia is viro while pretty much all other languages seem to have something that starts with `` est '' . 
  i do n't know the exact etymology of the name , but estonia has a region by the name of virumaa . 
  apparently we just started calling the whole country that instead of using the word `` eesti '' , which still exists in finnish . 
  `` why even bother writing , nothing 's going to come of this anyway . '', 
  the golden oldie was also updated to be more topical : http://i.imgur.com/zpsmrhj.png, 
  it 's finland , what did you expect . 
  how the mighty have fallen . 
  this hurts my very soul as someone who 's been an oranje fan since age three . 
  it 's not our fault that all the other languages just pretend they do n't have stretched vowel sounds and only use one letter to denote what we , more accurately , describe with two . 
  i was wondering whether that one shot of what appeared to be the sea was shot on the archipelago , and the majestic oak in southern finland . 
  good to know . 
  still , the vast majority of the shots were from the northern parts of the country where a minority of the people live and that only a small part of the population therefore sees . 
  i would much rather have seen something that shows the islands of saaristo , the lowlands of varsinais-suomi , the streams of kymi , the forests of etel\u00e4-karjala , pohjois-karjala , and keski-suomi , the lakes and fields of h\u00e4me ( which at least to me is the most idyllic finnish landscape ) , the flat fields of pohjanmaa , the bushy landscape of pohjois-pohjanmaa , and then lappi , all in equal measure . 
  it 'd be far cooler . 
  that may or may not have something to do with it . 
  i am loathe to admit . 
  i seriously ca n't tell whether or not this is sarcasm . 
  good job . 
  i do n't recognize this as * finland * , though . 
  these are laplandic landscapes , not really representative of the whole country . 
  which is a shame , because i think a similar timelapse covering locations across the entire country would be really cool . 
  i was a bit worried we would n't . 
  good to see this was done . 
  additionally , do we want to allow usa 's military presence in europe make us dependent on them to a degree where we follow their foreign policy and get dragged into conflicts with other parties ( russia , potentially china ) that we necessarily need not get into should we stand on our own two feet ? 
  yeah , honestly . 
  i like sweden and i treat most swedes like my brothers by default , but the glaring incompetence and the pathological social liberalism of their politicians is starting to undermine our national stability and well-being . 
  get your shit together , guys . 
  if you do n't want to vote for sverigedemokraterna , at least demand that the other parties adopt more sensible politics . 
  hold the downvotes , boys . 
  i 'm going in . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ downvote ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ switcharoo ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wrong ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ people, 
  taking young kids perceived as being talented in a sport away from their parents , who are n't in an economically stable stage in life , at a relatively young age , and making them live the sport in a far-off academy under rigorous training regimens and extreme discipline . 
  no other life allowed . 
  no non-aligning interests , friends outside the sport , experiences , schooling ( necessarily ) , anything . 
  everything for a few years of absolute success and short-lived fame when they reach the peak of their careers . 
  [ here 's an older article retelling a story of one such athlete ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/sports/olympics/21athlete.html?_r=0 ) . 
  not sure how reliable it is , but it is more or less in line with what is known about this in the west . 
  it 's literally stuff like this taken a little further that sparked the syrian civil war . 
  if i was erdogan , i 'd be more careful . 
  sure the sectarian fault lines are n't really there as strongly in turkey , but still . 
  merely an assumption , but i think the main reason xi is communicating this might just be that china is looking for someone to balance the conflicts between the us and russia and the us and china as they really gear up . 
  a strong , unified , and independent eu with its relatively large domestic market could be just that . 
  it 'd be a lot easier for chinese ( and to a lesser extent russian ) produce and money to enter the european market if the political alignment was n't as close to the us as it is . 
  and then there 's our old friend vlad from the east who has god knows how much actual wealth , and basically controls even more thanks to his position . 
  this is misleading . 
  the guidelines they have been given are about publishing the background of migrants suspected of crimes , i.e. 
  they ca n't tell the press that the suspect of a crime is a migrant even though they still absolutely do their job and treat migrants as suspects . 
  this is thought to protect migrants in general from getting labeled as criminals . 
  it wo n't work , and is an extremely stupid thing to do in an age where transparency and openness is valued above almost all else , but they mean well . 
  just incompetence at work as usual . 
  i was thinking the genetic group consisting mostly of speakers of finnic languages when i wrote that .
