  his vandal days are long since gone . 
  he 's even got his own youtube channel full of philosophical reflection and survivalist lifestyle tips . 
  they also have oil , gas , and metals . 
  yup , each and every one of them . 
  mostly due to the language encoding location primarily with cases instead of prepositions ( though those exist too ) . 
  [ if you think that 's bad , see this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_grammar#cases ) . 
  ` kuusi ' is actually two different lexemes . 
  it can be either the noun for ` fir tree ' or the numeral ` six ' . 
  similarly , ` palaa ' , is a homonymous form of two verbs . 
  it can be either the infinitive/nominative of the verb ` to burn ' ( * palaa * ) , or the 3rd person singular of the verb ` to return ' ( * palata * ) . 
  additionally , ` kuusi ' is also the 2nd person possessive form of the word ` moon ' ( in finnish ` kuu ' ) , formed by adding the possessive suffix - si at the end of the root word . 
  similarly , ` palaa ' can also be the plural partitive form of the word ` pala ' that means ' a piece ' , formed by adding the partitive suffix - a to the root . 
  how would you say have the european trends affected electronic music and the culture surrounding it in finland during the last two or three decades ? 
  does it show ? 
  and if it does , how ? 
   why not become one nation ? 
  ** short answer ** : because each eu country has centuries of history in regional/ethnic/national cultural formation , and federal unity would mean giving up on some of that . 
  people who still identify with their local and national cultures as their main political and cultural spheres do n't want that and wo n't want that until something changes . 
  \\ -- ** long answer ** : it 'd be a freaking ideologic-logistical nightmare of proportions dwarfing anything ever attempted in the us , the soviet union , or mao 's china . 
  practically the only two historic political entities that have achieved anything resembling what a united federal europe would have to mean are the roman empire and the mongol empire , and both of them only managed it very loosely . 
  what you need to understand is that regardless of the economic realities of the continent -- which very much are that the entire european economic area is complexly interdependent to a degree where an attempted secession or deviation from its main functioning will economically cripple a nation , as is going to be very evident soon with the case of the uk -- the ideological makeup of the continent remains a highly regionalistic/nationalistic one . 
  most people in europe , apart from those of us lucky enough to be so wealthy that we get a chance to explore life outside of the confines of our daily lives ( which , mind you , usually happen on a very small geographic area ) , live in culturally self-contained communities . 
  towns , municipalities , cities , regions , countries , what have you . 
  and unlike in the us where the expansionist history of the country meant that every new town and city was , on fundamental levels , a part of the same thing , a part of the collective effort of pioneers to build a country from scratch , in europe all those small communities have a wealth of history and stability that they uphold and identify with * stronger * than they identify with anything else . 
  the great wars , the rise of nationalism , and the construction of somewhat nationalist-collectivist states after ww2 all shifted some of that identity focus towards states , but people * still * predominantly identify with their perceived cultural roots . 
  and all of those communities with a strong enough cultural unity have , at some point in time , struggled for a degree of autonomy . 
  which leads us to the next big point : political disunity . 
  every country in europe has their own political system with their respective parliaments and legislations . 
  most regions have their own regional parliaments . 
  and all of those institutions come with their * own * institutionalised practices that have , over time , turned into cultural symbols just as well . 
  to add to the mix , each country having its own legislative culture means that companies operating across multiple european countries need to adopt multiple sets of policies and procedures to be able to conduct business . 
  the eu was created * primarily * to address this , even if the ideological basis was the prevention of further wars . 
  the fathers of the union realised that economical interconnectedness was the key to european stability , and the union has worked tirelessly to make that possible . 
  and if you ask me , that is exactly the factor that will in the future bring about political and cultural unity as well ; though even that will be difficult because the different economic cultures and habits of companies from different countries have brought up grievances about their ways in countries with different cultures . 
  then we have the question of defense -- each politico-cultural community has centuries of history of fighting others and feeling the need to defend themselves . 
  nations have over the course of aeons subsumed the juridical right to self-defense , so there are no more regional armies , but the perceived need of self-defense remains in the minds of people adhering to different regional and national identities across the continent . 
  especially when it comes to invasions from `` outside '' , like russia or the middle east . 
  so each nation has an army , or a contract with another nation 's army . 
  nowadays we have nato to fulfill that role . 
  but even within nato each country still retains some say -- and to realistically unify you would need to convince most states that they * can * give up their self-defense to a new , larger body . 
  so , in essence , what you would need to do in order to be able to create true european unity is the following . 
  you need to : * create conditions where regional/national identities can be exchanged for a european identity * somehow miraculously combine the legislations of european countries in a way acceptable to the populations in each * abolish regional obstacles for economic activity , while creating a system of checks and balances that makes the new european economy palatable to the peoples of different regions * create a new military body ** that everyone trusts and agrees with ** that takes over the self-defense of the continent basically , you 'd need a whole rebuild of the collective european identities to change the ideological mindset of * the majority of european people * . 
  without that , no functional unity will ever come about . 
  \\ -- it 's slowly happening , of course , with internal ( economic , cultural ) and external ( russia , refugee crisis , climate change ) pressures , but the process is very slow with cultural identities embedded so deep into the very essence of most europeans . 
  the quality of / r/worldnews is basically just the comment-sectionalization of reddit in plain sight . 
  it gathers a lot of attention from redditors from all walks of life as both a default and as the biggest `` big news '' aggregate on the site , which naturally results in the quality of the comments being reactionary , emotional , and fact-poor . 
  higher quality can not really be enforced very effectively on a platform like that .

  this . 
  ever seen nude finns that far apart from one another ? 
  me neither . 
  yep . 
  nah , we still hate him . 
  we treat that decision as a sign of the bolsheviks ' arrogant stupidity and lenin 's weakness of character . 
  but one idiot 's stupidity is a whole people 's opportunity , so naturally we took it .

  hmm . 
  i really hope that governments , both in croatia and the rest of southern and central europe , start channeling more and more money into firefighting and evacuation capacity . 
  this is going to be a yearly mainstay thanks to the changing climate and so many people are going to suffer if enough attention is n't paid to this . 
  my thoughts with people from there , i hope not too many lose their homes or worse . 
  trains have efficient heating systems . 
  you 're more likely to be too hot than too cold in the winter and whenever it 's actually cold enough for them to turn the heating on . 
  in the world of global geopolitics , one must assume both roles at once -- and realise the weight and requirements of each . 
  just ... just fuck off . 
  please . 
  it gets less and less funny with each iteration . 
  we 've heard this for three whole years now or so , and it 's getting more and more tired every time it 's brought up . 
  the meme stopped being funny ages ago , guys , ca n't we just bury it ? 
  [ how about this one too ? 
  ] ( https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1199,h_899,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/13-3-9516113.jpg ) yes , your tourism euros will be much appreciated . 
  do come . 
  and bring booze from tallinn while you 're at it . 
   pipeline nobody cares about which , amusingly , says quite a lot about your average german and their attitude towards both russia and the rest of europe . 
  i do , but i do n't think that was the main reason like many are quick to assume . 
  that was secondary , or one of the two big reasons , not the first and foremost one . 
  if halla-aho had , say , supported terho and niinist\u00f6 as his vice-chairs and had promised at least one of them a seat as a minister , i doubt any of this happens . 
  same thing if he had moderated his own stance a bit . 
  to me , this seems to be mostly about soini ( and some others ) and halla-aho never seeing eye-to-eye , and some of the others counting 1 +1 and rather choosing soini than halla-aho , whom they also knew would not be able to continue working with the current government . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  anti-immigrants will now absolutely vote halla-aho , and he will turn what is now his party into a full-fledged nationalist party reminiscent of pvv in the netherlands and fn in france . 
  i just do n't think the uv group is going to rescind their anti-immigration stance because it 's going to be an important facet in appearing as a `` defender of the forgotten '' like they want to be seen as ( or like soini wants to be seen as , and i think the others follow his lead because it gets votes and power ) . 
  especially since , if you take a look at the list of mps that went to the new group , they 're still quite anti-immigrant by their values . 
  anti-immigrants and the same people who voted for smp back in the day . 
  rural folk , who are convinced by politicians , who seem charitable and friendly and aware of their plight , visiting them . 
  the same group of people who in the us voted for trump solely because trump visited their states and promised , with quite an empty promise , that he would bring back their industry . 
  not all people are intelligent or politically literate . 
  who knows . 
  if they do n't , that 'll be the end of their collective political careers . 
  they certainly ca n't continue like this . 
  i find this criticism pretty groundless , honestly . 
  they clearly do have principles , ones that are quite different from those of halla-aho and his ilk , otherwise they would have stayed behind . 
  soini , for example , is critical of immigration only in principle , but he , as a devout christian , does not allow for actions that would mean people dying . 
  it 's just that they 're not very public about their guiding principles that makes them look more slimy than they really are . 
  what they * should * be criticised for , though , is using the principles of the anti-immigration candidates to gather votes for the party . 
  that was dirty . 
  they do n't have a party , they do n't have financial backing . 
  a new election would be murderous for them .
