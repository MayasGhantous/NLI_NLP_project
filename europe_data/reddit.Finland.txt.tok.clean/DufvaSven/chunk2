  like banning nuclear power ? 
  unless you 're into the [ `` alternative culture '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfadredw_os ) that berlin has become a hub for . 
  we only have pasha during easter . 
  good point . 
  they sell ipas by the case here so at that point it 's pretty boring . 
  everyone had a favorite brand before the current trend , however they were all similar-tasting lagers anyway [ ( sandels masterrace ) ] ( http://cdn.alko.fi/productimages/scaled/798684/zoom.jpg ) . 
  then again , breweries like kukko have made some nice variations for a long time . 
  here in ostrobothnia there were breweries in vaasa and pietarsaari that have now been started up again . 
  the trend simply goes in waves , and saying finland has had no beer culture ( or similar ) is n't really correct . 
  2016 , yes . 
  it 's a lunch beverage . 
  unless he 's talking about kotikalja ? 
  a style of low abv ( ~ 1 % ) , dark , sweet beer . 
  most of the refugees coming to europe are n't from syria . 
  they will be facing substancial social problems in the coming decades , some of which are already apparent . 
  if sweden is what you people think of as a role model , then yes . 
  the choice is irreversible . 
  the famous finnish invasions ( tm ) . 
  you realize there are millions more waiting ? 
  did n't know `` our values '' were to destroy our own societies . 
  what does it say about your country if you do n't know whether you 'll be defending or attacking ? 
  absolutely . 
  it 's `` the perfect storm '' of bad practices . 
  there are still problem areas where gang activity and drugs are rampant . 
  a general lower crime rate does n't change that . 
  and the us * is * saturated with guns . 
  you both have bits of the puzzle . 
  remember that the us has much more organized crime and a population saturated with firearms . 
  small concealable firearms . 
  if you 're a cop tasked with patrolling `` the hood '' then of course you 're gon na be quick on the trigger when people make quick and unexpected movements . 
  it 's simply a result from having competent , humane police . 
  they did that last time . 
  we had ice mines and artillery . 
  at least the swedes are learning from their mistakes . 
  sd is * very * moderate . 
  at least read a wiki on them or something before pretending to post facts . 
  sweden * 2016 *, 
  and 30 + grenade attacks in malm\u00f6 in a summer . 
  your stereotype is outdated . 
  read again . 
  in ~ ~ hippie ~ ~ neoliberal - run by green-sympathizers - countries , such as modern germany , the police are considered an enemy of `` the people '' . 
  thankfully , many balanced nations still exist . 
  here , the police are the second most trusted of all institutions , second only after the rescue services . 
  this in turn probably has a positive effect on how the police operate . 
  relativisation has been in full effect for years , just look at our dear neighbour . 
  calling islam a mental problem is a bit insensitive . 
  sweden had a problem before syria . 
  do n't worry , the sticky will pay off soon enough . 
  it 's only july . 
  why not sticky `` terrorist acts in germany ( july ) '' and just change the month . 
  calling people out on professional victimization ? 
  yes it is . 
  weapons do n't grow on trees or fall from the sky . 
  there 's a very big difference between ammunition and firearms . 
  germany accepted 300 000 balkan refugees in about a month during the war . 
  straight from a warzone without anyone even checking their cars or busses . 
   i stayed with a friend 's family in hamburg for two weeks and her father was a part-time major ( not the reserves , just part time . 
  weird , right ? ), 
  and they had regular problems with her brother being bullied , father being threatened , step-mother being excluded from social events all because they knew he was in the army . 
  what the fuck ? 
  this apathy is part of the problem . 
  kids will grow up thinking this situation is * normal * . 
  we are at a crossroad right now . 
  do we want grotescue random murders in the open streets to be part of everyday life permanently ? 
  is the shopping mall behind the [ train on the bridge ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a5gb1ca.jpg ) ? 
  it 's just my opinion . 
  then again , `` no frills , no nonsense , just a place made for it 's purpose '' also sounds like a warehouse , 
  did someone say [ curved wood ?

  this was a time of functionalism where the churches were built for multi-purpose . 
  the church features two parish halls ( seats total 220 ) , a deacon 's office ( actually diakoni/diakon ) , various club rooms , and a kitchen . 
  still does n't explain why they had to build it with concrete elements ... 
  we do , but they 're not going up on a list of `` ugliest churches in finland '' . 
  * if there was a list of `` most average church '' then [ alavieska ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e5/d5/db/e5d5db4f5cd166c46baed7148bd9eb07.jpg ) would win . 
  * churches from the middle ages are usually in stone , like [ this one ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/12963/normal__v3k5573.jpg ) from the 1300s . 
  i believe many of the older ones built in wood have perished due to fires .

  do n't send a communist to do a man 's job . 
  the correct choice was made . 
  that last one even looks kinda cool in comparison . 
  there 's some stupid bot removing posts based on links . 
  anyway , here are the same pictures and another few extra : li ve le ak.com/view?i=9e0_1468647341 looks pretty damn real , despite what the other guy said . 
  why are the pictures false ? 
  why are we looking at twitter posts ? 
  where were the pictures taken if not in turkey ? 
  especially the swedish festivals !, 
  there 's more piss on the streets of nyc alone , than in all of finland . 
  but what is justice ? 
  is it simply the word of the law , i.e. 
  the words written down by the state ? 
  if so , can sharia law or north korean law be considered * just * in their respective countries ? 
  is justice an eye for an eye ? 
  or do you consider justice what you 've grown accustomed to in finland ? 
  if so , political changes can also change what true justice is by rewriting laws . 
  around 65 % of finland 's total land area is covered in forest .
