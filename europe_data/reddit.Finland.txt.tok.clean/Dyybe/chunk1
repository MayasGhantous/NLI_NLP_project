why are we still not dark blue [ ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2rlvem2.gif ), 
  we have been number 1 coffee drinkers for a long time all nordic countries are on the top, 
  come to finland to see our beautiful forests and lakes . 
  because those are the only things worth seeing . 
  3d is 15 $ in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 finland ... some are 12 $ but the most hyped are 14 $, 
  well i did n't want them here anyway ... ^ ^ ; _ ; ^ ^ what ^ ^ did ^ ^ we ^ ^ do ? 
  my towns population is 2500 so yeah not much to do, 
  [ kangoku gakuen ] ( http://myanimelist.net/manga/25297/kangoku_gakuen ) is the name of the manga if someone is curious, 
  in / r/guns / u/zorthianator said this  [ also , you are confusing militia gun ownership with civilian gun ownership . 
  these are totally different things , just because militia soldiers do n't get free ammo does n't mean that it applies to the rest of the country . 
  you can easily buy and store all ammo you want in your house , hell , you can even order it by mail and receive it by post .

  guns are fun to shoot, 
  aagh i feel so bad every time when they look down the barrel ... 
  even after i dismantle them i still get shivers . 
  it would be pretty cool if all countries could have a change to try shooting somewhere easily it just feels so good , maybe after that some countries wont have such big fear for guns ... 
  well the rifle is a m96 swedish mauser not [ m/28 pystykorva ] ( http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/images/m27_nosecaps_front.jpg ) so i doubt that the guy in the picture is a simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 most likely swedish volunteer other than that good job, 
  neat couple protesting muslims are enough to change swedish government , oh boy i wonder why muslims have n't taken control of the whole world if its so easy ? 
  how exactly does the muslims change press freedom ? 
  i doubt there is that many muslims in the sweden 's parliament ... 
  finland number 1 !, 
  but why is sweden so much lower ? 
  or they will crap a knife and show it inside someones neck in anger ? 
  its true guns make killing easier but even with guns you need to load it before you can use it and if you have loaded gun in your home all time , you are pretty damn careless gun owner, 
  if they want to kill someone they will find a way to kill someone childrens dying from gun accidents are sad but if you store the guns in a gun-locker and hide the key from the kid , its easy to prevent you cant even buy knife if you under 18 year old in uk and they still have 130k assaults with knifes so yeah you do n't need guns to do harm people , because in the end its the people doing the harming, 
  noo guns are not the reason dammit do n't take my guns away goddamn murdering scum :( gold ? 
  umm thanks ? 
  who ever did that for a comment with 4 points ... 
  i 'm happy . 
  its still reasonably easy to get license for rifles and shotguns if you hunt but rights for handguns are almost impossible to get sadly, 
  nordic countries are no longer part of europe : /, 
  i agree with you , i have guns and i do n't really own them for self defense ( i hunt ) but if someone would break in to my house i would grab my gun and defend myself . 
  i just had to listen [ murheellisten laulujen maa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bxskign45w ) after this ... [ lyrics for people who are wondering why ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/murheellisten-laulujen-maa-land-mournful-songs.html-0 ), 
  the organization is growing stronger :o jokes aside that thing is huge as fuck , i wonder how much that things costs, 
  nope i 'm pretty sure we dropped 1 or 2 places on the education part and yes dutch jumped like 5 figures in the coffee consumption chart somehow, 
  yey now we have a reason to brag about something after netherlands stole our coffee spot, 
  germans sure know how to build tanks, 
  ** finland ** if you ask a finn who is the biggest hero most will answer [ carl gustav emil mannerheim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) and war heroes [ ilmari juutilainen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilmari_juutilainen ) 94 aerial combat victories other pilots with over 40 victories hans wind , oiva tuominen , eino luukkanen , olli puhakka , urho lehtovaara [ simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ) of course if you check any post that has finland on it you most likely already know [ lauri t\u00f6rni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lauri_t%c3%b6rni ) fought under three different flags , finland ( captain ) , nazi germany ( hauptsturmf\u00fchrer ) and united states special forces ( major ), 
  worthless list because sweden is better ; _ ;, 
  there is always time for sauna -30 c winter or +30 c summer does n't matter wich one, 
  well there are trains and buses and the mood is pretty much the same except usually i hear people saying thanks to the driver on buses, 
  heh not our fault that some americans cant even board a train without instruction, 
  amazing tank little bit of modernization and they can last for god knows how long, 
  we have fallen down from last year again : c, 
  here 's a good comparison http://images.hermes.lightfused.net/pc-vs-console.jpg,

  we have very odd language : /, 
  it was a joke but its good to know u.s states, 
  countries of europe are lot more relevant !!, 
  they are actually father and son, 
  denmark deserves noble peace prize, 
  its good : c, 
  fucking fuck fuck again nice 4 months of white snow , black snow , and wetty piece of shit snow that can go fuck itself, 
  well looks like out jokes about sweden ai n't so far form the truth after all, 
  wohoo number 7 i wonder when they did the survey , i mean if they did it during the winter finland might be on 10 least happiest countries list, 
  politics are actually trying to reduce drinking in finland by increasing the price or changing the times when you can buy alcohol but in the end they are just shooting themself to the feet because more and more go buy alcohol from estonia, 
  pretty much yeah, 
  well they wanted to show that uk will aid ussr against the nazi germany when operation barbarossa begun finland allied with nazi germany after winter war and aided germany in the operation barbarossa until they reached the pre-ww2 border of finland and the ussr the name for the hostilities between ussr and finland is called continual war ( jatko-sota ) uk was one of the only allied countries close by so they declared war to both finland and germany but there was little amount of operations by uk during the continual-war, 
  they tried to raid kirkenes town in norway and petsamo , liinahamari harbor part of the old finland border with bomber during the continual war to show their support to their new ally soviet union but they failed petsamo was almost empty and in kirkenes luftwaffe had been alerted and their fighters were in the air waiting for them * and i thought it would be funny to tell a little maybe not so well known story, 
  suicides are not part of the homicide well it seems that more guns = more gun related deaths but switzerland has only 0.7 difference to finland at gun owners but the homicide difference is a lot bigger in switzerland 0.52 , finland 0.26 half of the homicides , murders , manslaughter in finland yearly are made by men of marginalized groups unemployed , under-educated , drug or has an alcohol problems . 
  thirty-five percent of homicides are committed by family members , and ten percent of homicides are classified as youth violence but if we count all murders and homicides together only ** 14 % ** are made with guns when compared homicides/murders for switzerland , sweden and finland , sweden has more homicide and murders than finland and switzerland * switzerland year : 2009 = 84 convicted murders , * finland year : 2004 = 144 convicted murders * sweden year : 2009 = 232 reported homicides, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate sweden has 0.19 homicides with firearms per 100 000 and finland has 0.26 homicide but finland suicide rates with guns are a lot higher 3.34 per 100 000 and sweden 1.20 and switzerland actually has more gun related deaths than finland 3.84 and only homicides are 0.52 and heres number of guns per capita http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country finland 45 guns per 100 residents sweden 31 per 100 residents switzerland 45.7 per 100 residents,

  screw you too norway  :(, 
  wtf sweden zero points really ? 
  nordics strong, 
  and ? 
  finland had to defend against one of the largest nations in the world with limited equipment but thx sweden , hungary , norway and germany we at least got to keep our independence ... 
  tell me where is your country located ? 
  that 's right at the sea which means you have way better defensive situations against an attack compared to finland and sweden they are both located closely to both ussr and german . 
  and were way more richer country than finland during that time, 
  why have n't i seen this before ** glorius **, 
  it was smart thing to do we would have stayed neutral too but ussr decided to false flag us so there was nothing we could have done about it, 
  oh well hyv\u00e4sti tsekki it was nice to know you : /, 
  santa is where he belongs in lapland, 
  in finland they have guns .
