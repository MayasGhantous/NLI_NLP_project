  then centrists . 
  then whatever upper-twit party you have in power now . 
  then comes the far-right that wants to wreck welfare , drive everybody out etc. 
  greens tend to group either next to socialists or a bit right of the upper-twit party , depending upon historical background of socialists and greens . 
  [ of course , historically left has wanted to keep outsiders out as well , as it 's hard to keep the right mentality when outsiders come to share on the welfare cup -- once the outsiders get jobs , the left tends to quiet down -- but the right never is . 
  you might get a job , but you can never turn white . ], 
  huh . 
  nice idea . 
  alas , i 'm bad with names , so politicians it will be . 
  also i note they do n't have to be living people . 
  haha !, 
  a loophole !, 
  ** sweden ** : palme ( my idol -- one day i 'll get the poster on top of my bed so i can see his face just when i 'm falling asleep . 
  one of the biggest reasons i wish my passport had more crowns ) , gustav wasa ( founded the town where i was born !,

  ** denmark ** : ericsson ( the guy who is creatively in charge of egmont denmark 's disney stuff . 
  ca n't remember the first name , but i think it was something anglo-saxon ) . 
  saying `` king bluetooth '' counts , right ? 
  and the current king is christian something . 
  i think it was ix during ww2 . 
  ** norway ** : breivik ( not my idol ) . 
  i seem to have hard time remembering anybody from norway .

  i think morris ( lucky luke ) was belgian , was n't he ? 
  i 'm thinking several other comics artists here , but the changes are about 50/50 if they were french , so i think i 'll stay silent . 
  somebody else than a comic writer , perhaps ? 
  ca n't think anybody . 
  dammit . 
  ca n't even remember that king who fucked up congo really good . 
  the first ? 
  no , must be at least second , because he would be hard act to follow and you do n't list the first . 
  so , leopold the second . 
  that 's the ticket . 
  ** netherlands ** uh . 
  this is surprisingly hard . 
  that painter with missing ear . 
  ah well , it 's almost midnight .

  haha !, 
  ** wales ** . 
  i can only think that one actress in torchwood and ca n't remember her name either .
