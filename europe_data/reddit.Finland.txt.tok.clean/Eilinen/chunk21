  and as it happens , 96 % is very close to 95,2 % given in the article . 
  ** tl ; dr ** i believe that the number is correct , under certain conditions . 
  edit : according to [ statistics finland ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/perh/2011/02/perh_2011_02_2012-11-09_kat_005_en.html ) 83 % of children live with two parents , where `` two parents '' are defined as two adults in the household ( eg . 
  not necessarily biological parents ; one might be a step-parent and not necessarily of different gender than the other ) . 
  i can kind of see in a certain light why you would n't want to include south korea and japan into western world , but what do you have against hungary ? 
  the article mixes two topics ; divorce-rates and custody of children after divorce ( what with quoting marriage foundation and saying that children need their parents to be married ) . 
  [ over half of finland 's marriages end in divorce ] ( http://www.hs.fi/english/article/the+mysteries+of+divorce+finnish+style/1135250832154 ) , which , if not # 1 , is still [ rather high ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divorce_demography ) . 
  words do n't always have exact equivalents in other languages ( and `` equivalent '' words may have charged meanings in one languages that may not exist in others - prime example being `` negro '' in english and spanish ) . 
  this is one of the reasons why it 's good to have working knowledge of at least two languages - it gives perspective . 
  it 's not about forcing to watch american films in europe or european ( or asian ! ), 
  films in america - it 's about choice . 
  you yourself said earlier that if you wanted to watch french films , you would n't even know where to get them from . 
  in other words , you would n't find them in the film theatre nor in the video rental ( physical or electronic ) . 
  in other words ; if there is n't anything else but porridge on the table , you either eat porridge or you starve . 
  question of `` forcing '' or `` not liking '' does n't enter the conversation . 
  in europe , foreign films are either subtitled ( north europe ) , or dubbed ( continential europe ) . 
  we like to watch films from other european countries as well , and most of us only speak two or three languages . 
  few years back the nobel literature comitee gave a public statement that none of the `` big books '' of recent years were even translated to english . 
  the situation has n't improved since . 
  the same goes for films - americans do n't do foreign films - at best , they do new versions if they think the story might interest americans ( such as with * the girl with the dragon tattoo * ) . 
  i keep rooting for your independence . 
  i was there during the elections of 2007 and still have the paper-made scottish flag a parliament-hopeful of snp gave me back then . 
  the `` big thing '' is that the projected economic growth of 2013 on which our coalition government was built on will not happen ( as was pretty apparent from the get-go ) . 
  but as this was the glue on which the coalition was built on , the future is `` interesting '' . 
  taken together that most of kokoomus ' ( the pm-party ) `` strong men '' are leaving the ship in a hurry , it 's suspected by the most enterprising journalists that the current cabinet will not make it to the next election , but that either new cabinet will be created or even new elections held . 
  otherwise it 's pretty peaceful . 
  as / u/harriv indicated , the big news of the week was the missing 10-year old boy , with snow and the normal complications ( time tables ) holding the number two spot . 
  the child-thing is pretty big in finland as well . 
  the guy responsible for the finnish angle , dosent johan b\u00e4ckman , has been lying for years ( apparently starting from his thesis years ago about russian mafia ) . 
  alas , he 's very good in russian while most finns tend to think that world ends up at the border ( he 's also independently wealthy , so he has a lot of free time ) . 
  due to this he did n't really register on the radar before russian politicians started making visits and claiming that russian law trumps finnish law in finland . 
  which in turn increases antipathy toward russia and reinforces the stereotype of russia as a lawless country ruled by the `` might makes right '' philosophy . 
  the right-wing loves this , as it 's excellent tool in pushing their wet dream - nato membership - in the public consensus . 
  short version ; the competition ( deutsche bank ) was doing poorly , and some of the bnp management decided to celebrate by making a downfall-mashup with db starring and uploaded it to the intranet . 
  some people got freaked out ( including jewish workers in the american office ) and claimed that it was offensive to compare db to nazis . 
  i do n't really understand the need for this slip . 
  so many people like heavy metal in the north that long hair ( and beard , if they manage to grow one ) is rather common look for men . 
  and these nations do n't really have a culture of office clothes . 
  people use the same clothes as they do on free time ( as long as they are clean and generally not worn down ) . 
  the only problems i see are constant music playing and need to do less than full day 's work ( to get to the gigs and then to sleep late on the following day ) . 
  and there are a lot of jobs where the boss is n't interested in how or when you do your job , just that it gets done . 
  edit : [ picture of the swedish man ] ( http://a4.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/20/df6d9008637849dbbf6ac325c3fb98c4/l.jpg ) . 
  i would not look twice if i saw him on the street . 
  normal , if young-looking , for his age . 
  wow , if you want out of human rights and kyoto , you 'd better leave ... before you 're thrown out . 
  switzerland will not join no matter due to safeguarding their neutrality and norway is already a member in all but name due to nordic council . 
  eu has a clear plan , and it 's a good thing that all the members share that plan . 
  why would we want new members that do n't share that vision ? 
  eu is n't about enlarging its borders on some rampant manifest destiny-thing ; it 's about helping each other to benefit ourselves . 
  just looking at the money you give and take from eu is only looking at a very small part of the picture , as membership has also brought more business to uk . 
  that is the reason everybody joined ec back in the day ; the increased business , not because other members would give you free money . 
  there was an address to this effect few years ago . 
  got a huge amount of signatures . 
  do n't remember the details , but i would remember that commission killed it on technicality . 
  go for it !, 
  here 's few upvotes for motivation !, 
  if the number is bigger than one , i have missed some news lately . 
  countries ( and lately , eu ) have historically for a very long time been legal persons . 
  yeah , i 'm the same weight as you are but about 15 cents taller , and i had an idea that chances that you were my height were rather thin ... 
  but get into shape , young man !, 
  i did , years ago , it was surprisingly easy once you devoted just a bit of time for it , 
  legal personalities , i think , also count . 
  the local paper wrote today that we are incredibly lucky to live on times when we fight over bank notes with accountants instead of over land with soldiers . 
  the paper also noted that europeans got three peace prices in the 20s/30s for efforts in stopping france/germany from going to war . 
  i 'm not sure if this is an achievement . 
  are you closer to 150 cm or to 200 cm ? 
  what 's your bmi ? 
  yeah , and they could conveniently set separation from uk to the same time table . 
  you do n't separate 400 years of history in few weeks . 
  ok , i 'm going to check that we are on the same page here . 
  you have read the book , right ? 
  or at least other tintin-books ? 
  if you have n't this might be hard to explain . 
  there were several problems with the first edition ( such as tintin teaching propaganda about belgium to the kids ) that was removed from the new version in the 1940s by the author . 
  in the 80s ( after the author was dead ) , they removed the pidgin that the natives spoke and replaced it with more common language ( the quote is from wikipedia and does n't reflect the current version on the stores , i think ) . 
  so yes , the book was seen as racist and steps were taken to adjust to that . 
  you may want to read the [ wikipedia-article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tintin_in_the_congo ) to see in how the blacks were actually really small part of the story . 
  the main attraction was the local flora and fauna . 
  you might want to read what i wrote [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14k1hz/tintin_in_the_congo_not_racist_belgian_court/c7e68nv?context=3 ) on the subject of editing etc. 
  now ; some of the blacks act in strange ways ( such as in the panel that illustrates the article ) , but similar panels are found in all tintin-books , in majority of them done by white characters . 
  so this would n't be racism . 
  then there 's the part where herge was actually [ true to life ] ( http://www.okayafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-william-tintin-racist-throne.jpg ) but we , living here in europe do n't recognise it as such . 
  you could say that the characters were stereotypically drawn , but then i would say that this would be just about drawing the other - tintin is [ everyman ] ( http://agbeat.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/scott-mccloud.png ) , so he does n't have any features . 
  to avoid the africans looking like black everymen , they must have something to separate them from tintin - and from all the other white characters . 
  thus the prominent lips ( which are actually based in reality as well ) . 
  this is not racist ( black and asian artists do similar things when they decipher white people , who are not `` everyman '' ) . 
  this can be racist now , as black people are no longer seen as `` the other '' ( and you can see them readily in europe ) , but it was n't then . . and it was n't intended as such . 
  the clothes may look funny , but those herge drew from photos . 
  what have we left ? 
  a lot of characters that are somewhat simpleminded from tintin 's perspective ( of which he enjoys ) . 
  this superiority-complex is probably the part which you can say with confidence that is racist - but again , it probably reflects how white people acted toward blacks back then ( the main sources for the story were missionaries ) . 
  even if the blacks would have acted more smart-like , the interaction was n't such that it would have been noticed ( again , by missionaries ) . 
  so it ca n't be racist that herge draws this - its racist from modern perspective because he does n't debunk it , show the bad parts . . but how could he ? 
  he did n't know the bad parts existed !, 
  so , as far as the material for the book allows , the book is n't racist . 
  the parts that were there due to interpretation by herge , were redrawn . 
  but these are moving goals , and the source material was tainted ( nothing about plantations and cut hands ) , and there is n't much that can be done on that beyond what can has been done . 
  but taken on it 's own ( without knowledge of african culture then and today , without knowledge of other tintin-books , without knowing how the book was put together ) it is racist in dismissive way . 
  but there are n't really alternatives . . herge worked within the information he had . 
  but racism was n't the point of the book .
