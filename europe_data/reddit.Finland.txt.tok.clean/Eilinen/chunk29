  and what was thing about involving americans . 
  retards . 
  still independent !, 
  things are looking up !, 
  the soviet military brass leaves the country !, 
  all we had to do was sign this paper where we promise to fight germany in ww3 and something about soviet military restoring peace in case of rebellion . 
  ok , perhaps we 're still fucked . 
  1948 - 1984 yes massah ussr , no massah ussr , finland be a good boy . 
  1984 - 1988 ok , our president-for-life went and died and apparently it 's against the peace treaty to talk about anything without asking the russians first . 
  better try to find a new president-for-life . 
  oh , and they 're doing some rebelling down south . 
  the tanks will be there soon , i 'm sure . 
  better make sure they do n't come here . 
  1988 estonia declared independence !, 
  oh , those guys are gon na be fucked !, 
  1989 where 's the tanks ? 
  1991 soviet union fell . 
  how the hell did that happen ? 
  two months ago everything was going really well . 
  of course , there are some classes about how germany did at the continent , but most of the time is obviously spent with stalin being the bad guy , hitler giving weapons when britain and france being dicks over sweden . 
  gdansk has very little to do with any of that . 
  sorry for the language , trying to let you know how things were viewed back then . 
  not my opinions etc. 
  edit : numbering does n't work . 
  try to live with it . 
  yeah , if swizerland is in the `` federal european union '' - otherwise the whole thing might get a rather sinister undertone , 
  probably , most classes skip some things . 
  when talking of 1989 , finnish schools tend to speak of baltian liberation and especially of things that happened in estonia . 
  everything else is reflection of baltic independence movement from mid-80s forward . 
  for added perspective , the books talked how the fall of soviet union affected finland , who was economically and politically deeply tied to east . 
  from this perspective , what happened in poland and gdansk was just something that reflected the events in baltic states and did n't really need any special mention . 
  but i studied history at school in late 90s , early 00s . 
  obviously `` the story '' of soviet fall was still in development back then . 
  for comparison , assuming you 're younger than me , how 's the bush ii 's iraq war written on in the books ? 
  because that 's about as far away in the history as the fall of iron curtain was when i was in school . 
  dc is also pretty much the centre of the then-13 states . 
  i was trying to highlight that there are some problems in making one of the states the seat of government . 
  also , even though the area near potomac was a hellhole , virginia still wanted to keep their part of it !, 
  ( thanks for the info , have an upvote ! ), 
  i may have overspoken . 
  it 's just hard for me to grasp that how anything that 's near the western edge of eu can really be seen as the centre , 
  it may well be very significant for poland , but not to europe as a whole  i 've never even heard of the place ( sorry ) , and i doubt many other have either . 
  europe has a lot of history . 
  most places are full of it . 
  for example , if we take my austria-suggestion , you could always claim it was `` at the border of the roman empire and now the center of true european unity '' . 
  or other propaganda like that . 
  as i tried to explain above , if you take any place that is significant to one nation and not to others , you are going to create a lot of antipathy . 
  if you want to have to have `` historically significant '' place , there 's always bonn . 
   brussels is centrally located it 's about as far from the centre of eu as you can get without naming northern lapland or gibraltar . 
  yeah , they are n't optimal . 
  it just looked like the trend was to suggest a city that was already capital of one area or another ; i think this would be a mistake and easily cause animosity . 
  for example , if berlin would be chosen that would show that pigs were right about german hegemony and would cause a lot of trouble with france , britain etc. 
  that we currently have brussels is more of the testament for how little importance the precessor of eu used to have than of anything else . 
  also the center of `` europe '' used to go hundreds of kilometres west from berlin . 
  more recent example ; back when sweden and finland joined the union , the new representatives apparently had to complain repeatedly due to maps still being printed that just barely showed stockholm and helsinki , leaving the areas north of it off the map . 
  this also relates to the `` this is why usa does n't have railroads '' map on reddit the other day . 
  the poster claimed that scandinavia , poland and greece `` were n't really part of europe '' . 
  capital of federated europe would be a big place that would bring a considerable economic boost to the generic region where it is located ( on the magnitude of a five hundred kilometres to any direction , i would say , perhaps more if located next to sea ) . 
  when choosing the location , one should keep in mind that ; 1 . 
  most current cities were originally built to organise trade between farms ( the other alternative is harbour-cities ) , and are such in the middle of the most fertile ground on the area . 
  as the cities grow , they consume land that is the best on the region . 
  it would be better if the land/town/city chosen as the new capital would be such that some resource or advantage would not have to be removed for the capital area to thrive ( for one extremely blunt example - if the capital was next to the best natural resources area in the world , it would still be left unexploited while less good natural resources would be dug out elsewhere ) . 
  the capital should be at a place that is easily accessible from all governed areas . 
  while this is less important today than it was before air travel became common , the capital would still end up being the middle of an infrastructure network of railways , roads and yes , even air travel . 
  to ensure that all areas of would be best served by the new capital , it should be located such that the spider-web of infrastructure would n't be `` off-balance '' . 
  for example , currently the european railway-system is centered on paris , which causes quite the turns if you are trying to get from nearly any location to anywhere else using trains . 
  on the risk of repeating myself , the area should be , if not uninhabited , at least habited by very few people before hand ( because areas with few resources or farms will probably not have a lot of work to do , either ) ; also that no previous special cultural identity would be disturbed . 
  the capital should have space to grow . 
  this means it should not be located on an island nor next to culturally important ruins . 
  the new capital can even be located in a hard-to-build area , as money will not be a problem for any place chosen as the capital of a place like europe . 
  the area chosen should probably have to be a special area and not part of any nation ; similarly as washington dc was removed the then sovereign states of maryland and virginia . 
  thus it should perhaps not be in the middle of any current state , so as to not make it a `` donut '' . 
  for these reasons , i would probably suggest some of these places ; - ** western coast of the continental denmark ** ; virtually uninhabited as it is ; no natural resources and land is too sandy for farming . 
  easy to access from both north and from south , as well as from west and east . 
  building here would make the roads in balanced fashion to pretty much every place in europe , without scewing to one side or another . 
  easy enough place to built to . 
  it 's pretty `` in the middle '' geographically . 
  as a minus , if glaciers melt , it will be the first place to go . 
  - ** some backward place in the alps , perhaps at the border of austria ** . 
  again , somewhat `` middle '' , low population density , building would be hard but this would give the capital an identity unlike any other . 
  infrastructure would be greatly improved on the area . 
  if glaciers melt , it will probably still be over water . 
  quite far from scandinavian peninsula , but nobody lives there anyway . 
  there are many forms of prisoner 's dilemmas . 
  one of the more famous one is as goes ; everybody piles the previously agreed sum of money into a bucket in a closed envelopes ; an outside observer then counts the money and doubles it . 
  the money is then divided back to the people on equal shares . 
  after few turns , somebody notices that even if you do n't put in the agreed upon sum ( or even leave the envelope empty ) you still get money back . 
  of course , at this point everybody else notices that the amount of money you get back from the system is getting smaller , so what do they do ? 
  they start entering with empty envelopes themselves . 
  in the end nobody enters nothing and nobody gets anything . 
  there 's also the question of efficient work . 
  i suppose swedish model is very close to finnish model in that the government tries to provide good services with minimum amount of money . 
  southern countries ( obviously greece is now target point , but also applies to france , etc. ), 
  also use government to `` protect traditional lifestyles '' . 
  thus we get stuff like busses having both driver and another person punching tickets and opening doors . 
  finland had this too , but then we found a way to do the ticket punching fast enough that one person could do both . 
  this would have been in the late 1950s . 
  france has manned , government operated railway stations where trains have n't come in decades .
