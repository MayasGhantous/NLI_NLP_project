  foreign politicians surely knew . 
  it was known that greece had cooked the books to get into euro , and the figures given afterwards were suspect as well . 
  but the rules said that we had to believe on the data you provided . 
  if it was cooked , there was n't anything one could do . 
  doing otherwise would have been against greek sovereignty . 
  some of the lending banks must have known as well , as i understand some of the banks helped do that cooking . 
  do n't know anything about imf or ecb , but i do n't think they had much authority back then , when things were going ok .  people were getting better off , we were a full member of the eu , in good international standing . 
  businesses were opening left and right , people were buying things such as cars , tvs and computers and greece seemed to be participating in world events more and more ( culminating in the organization of the 2004 olympic games ) . 
  ok , i get that . 
  thanks for typing that out . 
   i bet that 's what you think for your country right now . 
  suppose that in ten years you suddenly learn that this prosperity has been fake and that you have been ` over-borrowing ' all this time . 
  i 'm a bit younger than you , but i still remember the time before [ finnish banking crisis of the early 90s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_banking_crisis_of_1990s ) . 
  it was mostly caused by relaxation of banking norms , and not by corruption , but the end result was the same . 
  everything was swell and then the music stopped . 
  unemployment rose and peaked at 18,4 % ( i understand that greece is now around 13 % ) . 
  but life goes on . 
  we did heavy cutting on social services , lent heavily to put a lot of money into the banks to keep them somewhat stable ( they later paid back ) , prosecuted some banksters and redid the banking laws . 
  in time things went to normal again . 
  but i do n't have a cent of debt on my name and neither do many others of my generation . 
  i have n't even taken student loans , preferring to work for the expenses that i could n't cover with student allowance . 
  seeing to where lending led in the 90s was more than enough . 
  i suppose that some day i 'll take a mortgage and buy [ a flat/a house ] , but not before i have half the money on the bank account and can be reasonably sure that i can keep myself employed till i pay back the other half . 
  but still , things are n't optimal . 
  big part of the pension money was lost in the recent upheaval , the baby boomers are retiring and the exports are n't really looking that good either . 
  we 're lending money and giving it to you , greece , in hope that we can make things a bit better and perhaps have the luxury of thinking stuff like retirement ages in five years . 
  instead we hear stuff like blaming us for lending you and acting in a manner that makes one think that not only did we waste our 3 billion euros ( which is a big sum for a country of our size ) , we might actually have made things worse . 
  and blamed for it . 
  not fun . 
   edit : just saw that the you regretted the last comment , thus the strike-out . 
  i 'm striking out my comment too , however i still disagree with you that the blame lies on maria and the millions like her . 
  perhaps there are thousands ( upon thousands ) that have profited and exploited others , but maria is part of the hard-working millions , not the crooked thousands . 
  that was the point of the article , really . 
  yeah , as i said , i got a bit heated and i regret it . 
  it might be a cultural difference , but here , seeing or suspecting a crime and not doing anything about it is enough to make you part of the crime as well . 
  from my perspective , the end note was basically `` i saw them rob the bank but did n't think to call the police '' . 
  remember that saudi-arabia , bahrain etc. 
  were real hellholes before we started buying energy from them as well , 
  yeah , kind of lost control at the end there , kind of regret it now . 
  let 's do a fast edit . 
  my father always used to say ; * it 's not about the income , it 's about the expenses * . 
  seeing these articles about hardworking greeks and `` busting the myths '' never seem to answer my most basic question ; if they did everything right , how are we in this situation ? 
  how the hell did n't anybody notice about the numbers not adding up ( i wo n't give any anecdotes as they might be `` myths '' ) ; the signs had to be there for years . 
  there must have been thousands upon thousands of people who knew that this was not only wrong , but also unsustainable . 
  and yet nobody did anything . 
  to paraphrase my father ; it is n't about what you do right ; it 's what you do wrong and are n't willing to do otherwise . 
  which correlates with this ;  [ maria ] has n't voted in ten years -- `` they 're all the same '' , she says , `` liars and crooks '' . 
  she knew for ten years and did n't do anything . 
  and according to the article :  there are millions like her . 
  if we are meant to take this article as the definite version of what happened to greece , ignoring all the others that came before it , it is n't giving very good picture . 
  basically all the good people did n't care , just left the `` liars and crooks '' doing whatever they wanted . 
  corruption and incompetence . 
  surely these crooks and liars have been arrested for all the damage they did and are now waiting for their day in court , right ? 
  right ? 
  i mean , you have to blame this situation on somebody ? 
  tried to do a swift googling and only came up with this ; [ greek police union wants to arrest eu/imf officials ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/us-greece-police-idustre8190uc20120210 ) . 
  ~ ~ fuck you maria and all the millions of people like her . ~ ~ ( waiting for the downvotes . ), 
  there 's nothing wrong with being lazy , as long as you can pay your bills on time and do n't have to take loans for daily living . 
  nor is there anything wrong with being a hardworking person , no matter do you make bucketloads of money or just barely make ends meet . 
  illegal based on what laws ? 
  in case you forgot , eu does n't have dominion over sahara , so we will be just changing russia and opec to another set of countries . 
  without eu and nato , the singular states in eu would be threatened by pretty much any smallish country on the area , starting from belarus . 
  i do n't see why you were downvoted . 
  during the oughties there were several tries to make a proper eu army without being dependant on nato , but usa always torpedoed for reasons of their own . 
  the first link i found with somewhat right-looking facts : [ link ] ( http://www.eutimes.net/2009/12/usa-opposes-the-idea-of-european-army/ ), 
  the thing is , you ca n't separate peace-time and wartime that easily . 
  if the relations are good during peace-time , others are more likely to help you during wartime . 
  otherwise you might find out that when war does come up and you 're in need , your `` friends '' may just look at you and shrug . 
  formal alliances are well and good , but in the end nations are made of people and it 's the relations between those people which ultimately decide the relationship between nations . 
  formal alliances with pompous declarations are well and good , but without any feeling behind it , they 're just declarations . 
  so you are saying that you want the situation between eu and usa to be roughly similar to the one that exists between china and usa or russia and usa ? 
   yeah my point was that nato might not be necessary anymore now that their is the eu ( and actually might rather drag the integration of european armies ) . 
  estonia is in both eu and nato and they had that statue-episode . 
  finland is in eu and we have to suffer repeated `` accidental '' flyovers ( and all the rest i listed above ) . 
  i agree with you on the integration issue on a whole , but excluding finland and sweden , pretty much all the eu countries are in nato and supposedly integrate through that ( that 's also the main expressed reason why we should be in nato as well - it 's a topic that 's always on the table in finnish politics ) . 
  it 's true that eu battlegroup is n't exactly a formidable force . 
   iirc finland is not a member of nato . 
  yet i do n't think you guys ( educated guess ) feel more insecure about it than say poland or bulgaria . 
  apart of south-korea , we maintain the biggest army per capita of all democratic countries . 
  this is officially to `` safeguard territorial integrity '' . 
  seeing as how sweden does n't have army these days and norway is what it is , you can probably make few educated guesses on the context behind that phrase . 
  [ poland 's relations are n't anything to write home about either ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland%e2%80%93russia_relations#deployment_of_us_missile_defense_shield_in_poland_and_the_south_ossetia_war ) . 
  i do n't know enough about the bulgarian situation to comment on that with any authority . 
   but when you speak about `` new europe '' i see only belarus and ukraine ( clearly under russian influence ) . 
  all the other east-european countries are in the eu . 
  my point was that if not for eu/nato their situation would be different . 
  even while estonia was in nato and eu , they still had problems with russia during the statue-episode in 2007 . 
  without support from eu/nato , things would probably been even harder ( of course , this is all speculation ) . 
  and it 's not just belarus and ukraine . 
  in the late 90s russia was everywhere in the balkans , claiming common heritage and interests , pushing for regional superpower-status . 
  i 'm sure you remember this if you followed news back on the day  personally i think the main reason why eu expanded so hastily toward east even though the countries were n't ready for membership was to get russia to back off . 
  the only country there today who is n't an eu member , candidate or wannabe is serbia , and from them brief googling granted me pages like [ this ] ( http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/05-04-2011/117464-russia_serbia-0/ ) , [ this ] ( http://www.europeanforum.net/news/752/russian_president_pays_historic_visit_to_serbia ) and [ this ] ( http://rt.com/politics/roar-russia-strengthen-presence/ ) . 
   and i frankly do n't see russia trying to pull the military card on the eu anytime soon . 
  you do n't have to start an invasion to prove that you 're ready to do business . 
  you can also move forces nearer the border of the country you want influence over , open new bases near the border ( claiming `` tactical reasons '' ) , do `` accidental '' flyovers over the neighbouring country and check how fast the airforce of the other country answers , do army rehearsals near the border etc. 
  they all increase pressure . 
  ( russia does all of these with finland . ), 
  russia has also officially said that it protects all russians everywhere , even if said russians do n't have citizenship of russia . 
  has led to fun situations with finland and our small russian minority ( with russian officials coming here to instruct in how to run things etc. 
  ) , ca n't even imagine how things are in the former soviet block where the russians are the majority in some provinces .
