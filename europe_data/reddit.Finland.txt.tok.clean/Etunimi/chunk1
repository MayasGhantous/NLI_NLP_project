since the article does n't mention it , just for the record , the current fighter fleet is [ 62 f-18 hornets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_air_force#aircraft_inventory ) . 
  official joint accident investigation commission report , with a lot of information : [ final report on the mv estonia disaster of 28 september 1994 ] ( http://onse.fi/estonia/ ) ( [ table of contents ] ( http://onse.fi/estonia/conten.html ) ) . 
  in finland we just have the voter write down the number of the candidate they vote for ( the booths have the lists as well ) . 
  americ is talking about russian-labeled finnish products that were destined to russia until the sanctions , but are now being sold domestically ( a special exception was granted this week to allow selling of sanctioned foodstuffs with foreign labels ) . 
  well , in 2005 it topped approx . 
  164 000 viewers ( finnish pop at the time 5.2 m ) , being the 20th most popular show on its channel subtv , behind big brother , idols , a collection of movies , and x-files ( [ source pdf ] ( http://www.finnpanel.fi/lataukset/top20%202005.pdf ) ) . 
  i guess if you directly scale to the u.s. population ( 295.52 m at the time ) this would translate to approx . 
  9.3 m us-equivalent viewers . 
  unfortunately i could not locate the u.s. ratings at the time , so no idea if it was `` bigger '' in finland than in u.s. . 
  in 2006 the special finland episode had 399 000 viewers ( 38 % share , 22.7 m us-equivalent ) , being the 3rd most popular show on its channel subtv , behind only the big brother finale ( 476 000 ) and big brother talk show preceding the finale ( 423 000 ) ( [ source pdf ] ( http://www.finnpanel.fi/lataukset/top20%202006.pdf ) ) . 
  i think there were no other `` similar '' u.s. evening talk shows airing here at the time that i knew of ( not sure what the situation is now , i know conan ~ ~ airs on fox at least ~ ~ aired on fox until 2012 then canceled ) - i have n't watched them either so i do n't know if they could 've provided any competition here . 
  addendum : subtv was the fifth-biggest channel at the time , but way smaller than the bigger channels - 400 000 viewers would not get you in any top lists on the bigger channels , as you can see in the pdf links . 
  well , if you have coverage partners , do n't they need to have equal prices as well ( still assuming no limitations ) ? 
  otherwise people would just jump to the other partner . 
  and equal prices means rising prices for one side . 
  of course , unified prices for all of europe at the expense of higher-than-previously prices in finland and other cheap-mobile countries is not really unthinkable , but that is indeed what the finnish negotiators are against ( the article says other countries are divided on the issue - it does not mention specific countries , though , so i do n't know if any cheap-mobile countries are okay with rising prices ) . 
  you are right it is a smaller issue for the bigger players ... but i 'm not sure if i want to go to the direction of a few big carriers like u.s. . well , i guess `` a few big carriers '' is not the only or main reason the u.s. mobile market is like it is , so maybe it 'd still work better here in europe , who knows . 
  the luxembourgian carrier still has to pay wholesale roaming fees to the french carrier , so it depends on whether the wholesale roaming fees are higher than the luxembourgian carrier 's local infrastructure operating cost . 
  my understanding is that the regulated wholesale roaming fees are currently considerably higher than what the local operating cost would be , so it would be the french carrier who benefits , while the luxembourgian carrier faces pressure to raise their prices . 
   i can buy finnish bread if i wanted to , no british bread maker can stop me . 
  imho that analogy does n't really work here . 
  it is more like you can buy finnish bread or british bread , but with abolished roaming fees ( and without any limits ) the finnish producers can no longer charge more for shipping internationally =  they have to raise the local shipping prices to the international shipping level . 
  currently , even with the free movement of goods , producers can still charge more for shipping to europe than for shipping locally . 
  sure , there may be air in the roaming fees now , and this regulation is indeed a good thing , but it is still more expensive for a carrier if you use their plan outside their own coverage zone ( since they still have to pay non-zero wholesale roaming fees to the other carrier ) , causing customer prices to raise if a significant part of their customer base starts doing that all the time . 
  at least the finnish minister of communications is seeking to avoid that possibility by somehow preventing the permanent use of a plan in another country . 
  that would be to avoid rising prices due to carriers having lots of customers that never use their own network but a foreign one who the carrier has to then pay according the customers ' use . 
   we eat our packed lunch and then go have our next class  interesting , is that the norm in denmark ? 
  here in finland all primary schools provide the lunch . 
  i had somehow assumed all the nordics were similar in this regard ... 
  cold lunch every day for ~ 6 years of school sounds a bit strange , or do you warm it up or something ? 
  hmm , or maybe it is not so bad if the schooldays are not that long and you have something more proper when you get home ?

  our rules are : party has to gather 5000 signed supporter cards to get admitted to the party register . 
  if the party fails to get seats in two successive national parliamentary elections , they get removed from the register and have to re-gather 5000 supporter cards to get readmitted .

  the current finnish national government cabinet consists of a coalition of ncp , social democratic party , the green league , the swedish people 's party and the christian democrats ( left alliance left the government due to a budget dispute two months ago ) . 
  ( note : christian democrats are to lose their seat ~ because they do not have a common list with true finns like the last time ) ** post-election update ** : swedish people 's party did not lose their seat , ncp did not gain one .

   finnish : `` kissanhnta '' - cat 's tail should be `` kissanh\u00e4nt\u00e4 '' . 
  though i think '' \u00e4t '' and `` miukumauku '' ( `` miuku '' and `` mauku '' are both words for `` meowing '' of a cat ) are more common . 
  i do n't think that conclusion can be drawn from the linked result , though . 
  it asks `` which of the following do you think is the most positive result of the eu ? '' . 
  if my country did n't have the euro , i would n't feel the benefits of it and therefore it would n't be in my toplist of positive results , even if i had no complaints either .

  i believe the parent meant nuclear fusion as one of the `` precious few exits '' , not nuclear fission . 
  good point , however in that case one would more likely say `` kuutonen palaa '' or similar ( which means the same ) , as `` kuusi palaa '' is a bit too ... weird , even though i guess technically correct ( to me `` kuusi palaa '' for burning number six is like english phrase `` six burns '' , it just does n't sound right without an additional specifier making it clear the number is what is being talked about ) . 
  correct , one 'd normally use `` toinen '' ( ~ second/another/other ) for both . 
  for me lidl , k group and s group are all in the same nearby shopping center , i 've been using k group for no particular reason .

  the christian democrats have 6 members in the 200-member parliament . 
  i 'm not trying to defend what she said , but note that this speech was in a religious meeting/gathering , not in a political forum . 
  what she said as part of the speech is freely translated : `` we 've all had some situations where we have to think if we dare to do something against the popular opinion , friend pressure or even the law , if those are against the words of god . 
  in the bible , however , it is said that `` one should obey god more than people '' . '', 
  she later corrected that she did n't intend to mean finnish law with that .

   one thing made clear to me by your post is that it seems i do n't understand how the reverse charge mechanism works and i 'll have to ask my tax accountant . 
  i 'm booking the intra-community bills as i receive them from the foreign companies , usually with 0 % vat . 
  now , it might be that my software ( datev ) does the acquisition vat magic for me , but i 'd have to ask my accountant . 
  at least i 'm booking these bills in a manner which was shown to me by my accountant , so i 'm relatively confident that things are in order . 
  yeah , it is easy to misunderstand , though the example i gave is often helpful . 
  no idea how this usually works in practice with software . 
  in finnish tax forms ( [ english pdf ] ( http://www.vero.fi/download/2015__periodic_tax_return/%7b0ec9a360-c818-4bda-a4c2-20e74240597e%7d/10288 ) ) for intra-community acquisitions you put the ( zero-vat ) purchase price in `` purchases of goods from other eu member states '' field , and the finnish acquisition vat ( 24 % ) payable into both `` tax on goods purchased from other eu member states '' ( i.e. 
  now payable to tax authority ) and `` tax deductible for period in question '' fields ( so it can be then deducted from vat of sales , and thus overall effect is zero like with domestic vat ) . 
  for comparison , regular domestic purchases would be put just into `` tax deductible for period in question '' field ( as you paid the tax to the seller already , who remits it on their own form ) . 
   i was under the impression that google simply saves the vat , but according to your explanation that 's just a misunderstanding on my part , probably because i 'm still too used to thinking in the `` every price includes all taxes '' consumer mindset . 
  yep , in the end it is just the end customer who ultimately pays the vat , when companies buy and sell stuff the net gain/loss due to vat is effectively zero ( even though the way vat is handled varies depending on the transaction ) as seen in the examples . 
   let me close on a somewhat philosophical note : all this is too complicated . 
  while i appreciate the things that have been achieved in facilitating intra-eu commerce , there remains a lot to be done , regarding taxes and otherwise ( do n't get me started on fixed prices for print works ) . 
  it kind of does n't `` feel 2015 '' that selling something to a museum shop in strasbourg makes it necessary to use a completely different vat mechanism than selling to a museum shop in stuttgart . 
  sure , i completely agree with that . 
  it is not easy to come up with a working simpler solution , though , without agreeing on a single vat rate and centralizing the vat collection to eu authorities . 
  maybe some solution where you would just charge german vat and they would be still be able to deduct it somehow ( though the recipient would still have to pay the tax difference due to different rates ) ...
