  i guess that would make the tax administration much more complex since they 'd have to do transfers between countries ( handling all the different exemption rules and rates ) , on the other hand it would be more streamlined for the companies ( though buyers would have to report to tax authority on which tax rates and from what countries they bought the stuff , then ) , so could be a net win . 
  but i guess the european single market people are in a better position to figure out what should be done than me . 
  no , same here , the 100m level loads as solid gray . 
   honestly can blame customs for a lot of it . 
  fedex is one of the cheapest ways to ship heavier stuff from us to sweden , but then you get 20 $ in `` administration fees '' , plus whatever the customs agency says is how much vat you should pay on the item . 
  here you can just declare the stuff yourself on the customs website so there will be no `` administration fees '' . 
   all the different tax laws in general in europe really hinders the ability for companies to sell cheap and easy in europe , imo . 
  i do n't think so . 
  for services maybe , but not so much for goods . 
  when selling goods you just charge your local vat for consumer sales to eu , and no vat for sales to outside eu or b2b sales in eu . 
  no need to concern yourself with the tax laws of other countries than your own . 
  * except * if your sales to a single country exceed 35000 eur or 100000 eur ( `` distance selling threshold '' , depending on the country ) per year , in which case you will need to do additional country-specific tax stuff ... but i think at that point you are n't that small a company anymore , so probably it is not that much of an issue . 
  i think shipping costs and localization issues are more problematic . 
   [ ... ] but dhl 's prices are what they are . 
  my shipping costs for an a0 poster ( box is relatively small but longer than 60 cm on the longest side ) are 10 euros after i `` absorb '' the taxes that come on top . 
  dhl 's international prices are actually pretty cheap compared to the rates of the postal services of many other countries , including finland . 
   also , i have to charge all my customers the german vat , even though that is not necessary for cross-border sales according to eu law . 
   do you know why i have to do it ? 
  because the german tax revenue service demands that i get a form made by them filled out and signed by each non-german customer if i want to charge them no vat . 
   this is of course completely impractical for items shipped to the door of ordinary people so i ca n't do that . 
  err . . you absolutely ** have to ** charge german vat for `` ordinary people '' . 
  0 % vat only applies to intra-community supply , which means you selling to a non-german ** company ** in eu , which has to be identified in the invoice ( vat id ) . 
  the buyer company would then pay their local vat on that purchase to their own tax authority ( ~ ~ or ~ ~ and then deduct it from the vat of their own sales ) . 
  see article 138 of the [ vat directive ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/all/?uri=celex:32006l0112 ) , paragraph 1 . 
  note that `` taxable person '' in the context of vat means a person or entity who performs independent ` economic activity ' ( per title iii ) , i.e. 
  basically companies and self-employed people , so this exemption does not apply to `` ordinary people '' . 
  all ( non-exempt ) goods sold within eu need to have vat paid on them , by either the seller or the buyer . 
  normally it is the seller , but in company-to-company transactions it is the buyer ( per place of supply rules ) . 
  for a simpler summary , see e.g. 
  [ this debitoor page ] ( https://debitoor.com/features/accounting/intra-community-transactions ) that explains your obligations when selling to eu private persons and companies , and when buying from other eu companies . 
   all the big american companies for whose services i am paying ( facebook ads , google ads ) , however , do n't charge me vat , so that i do n't get the vat on their services back when i charge my customers vat for the products i sell . 
  with google adwords in europe you are actually contracting with google ireland , and they do n't charge you vat since you have informed them of your vat id , so they use the ` reverse-charge ' mechanism where they put your vat id on their invoice and you should be declaring them as intra-community service acquisitions on your tax form , i.e. 
  you are liable to pay vat on the adwords purchases to the german tax authority . 
  of course you will be able to deduct it from the vat of your sales , as with all other vat . 
  this works in quite similar way as the selling-goods-to-other-eu-companies case explained above . 
  it is done this way so that you can sell to companies in other eu countries without you having to register with their tax authority ( which you 'd need to do if you would be charging their vat ) , while still allowing them to `` reclaim '' the vat on the purchase ( if you had charged them your own german vat , they 'd have to reclaim it from germany ) . 
   in essence , i 'm made to pay a tax rebate to google and facebook through the vat system . 
  huh ? 
  you 'd be in the exact same position you are now if google charged you vat , or even if you had bought the ads from a german company . 
  current situation : * google adwords charges you * 10 eur * for ads , 0 % vat . 
  * you need to pay 19 % vat = * 1.90 eur * on the adwords to german tax authority as acquisition vat . 
  as with other vat you pay on your supplies , you can deduct it from the vat of your sales . 
  * you sell a product worth 30 eur , and also charge your customer 19 % vat = 5.70 eur , total * 35.70 eur * . 
  * =  you have to remit 5.70-1 .90 eur = * 3.80 eur * to the german tax authority . 
  * in the end you 've gained -10 -1.90 +35.70 -3.80 = ** 20.00 eur ** . 
  google has gained ** 10 eur ** . 
  situation where google would 've charged you german vat , or if you would have bought the ads from a german seller , substituting google : * google adwords charges you 10 eur for ads , plus 19 % vat = 1.90 eur , total * 11.90 eur * . 
  * google needs to remit that * 1.90 eur * to the german tax authority . 
  * you sell a product worth 30 eur , and also charge your customer 19 % vat = 5.70 eur , total * 35.70 eur * * =  you have to remit 5.70-1 .90 eur = * 3.80 eur * to the german tax authority . 
  * in the end you 've gained -11.90 +35.70 -3.80 = ** 20.00 eur ** . 
  google has gained 11.90-1 .90 = ** 10 eur ** . 
  so both you and google would 've gotten the same amount , except that now both you * and * the ads seller would have had to do tax stuff with the german tax authority ( of course no big problem for google , but would get complex for a smaller seller , hence vat is left for the buyer in the company-to-company case as explained above ) . 
  ** edit ** : sorry if i sounded a bit angry , i was way too tired while writing this , 
  looking at my provider 's [ channel selection ] ( https://elisa.fi/attachment/content/el_ktv_kanavakartta.pdf ) , i have the possibility to get these international non-english ( except uk ) foreign-language channels : \\* estonia : etv * france : france 2 * germany : rtl * italy : rai uno * russia : channel one russia , ntv mir * sweden : svt1 , svt2 , tv3 , tv4 , tv6 , svt24 , barnkanalen , kunskapskanalen , svt world ( international compilation ) * spain : tve ( int.comp . 
  ) , canal 24 horas * uk : bbc brit ( nordic ) , bbc earth ( nordic ) plus these multinational ones : \\* 3sat ( germany/austria/switzerland ) * arte ( france/germany ) * tv5monde ( int.comp . 
  of france/belgium/switzerland / canada ) * al jazeera ( arabic ) ( the english-language news / current events channels available are : france 24 , deutsche welle , nhk world ( japan ) , russia today , bbc world news , cnn , bloomberg , cnbc , sky news , euronews , al jazeera english ) so we get some foreign national channels , but no more than 1-2 per country ( except for sweden ) . 
  do you get a more complete lineup there ? 
  i wonder how the tv rights go , i guess most non-local content is blocked in these international broadcasts ? 
  edit : added some missing ones, 
  i do n't think that is the norm through eu , though . 
  with my cable provider bbc world news is in the basic paid set ( you get it if you pay for any package ) , and then there are the [ bbc nordic ] ( http://www.bbcnordic.com/ ) channels ( bbc brit , bbc earth * ) as part of the larger `` assorted '' channel packages , but no bbc1/2/etc . 
  similar with other providers here . 
  -- ^ ( * plus bbc hd and bbc lifestyle until the end of 2015 ), 
  they still plan to expand to japan , spain , italy and portugal this year ( in addition to australia + nz they already launched earlier this year ) , and they plan to continue rapid expansion through 2016 , starting to deliver global profits in 2017 ( they 've been running their international streaming at a loss so far , due to the expansion costs ) . 
  at least that is how i 've interpreted their last few [ shareholder letters ] ( http://ir.netflix.com/events.cfm ) . 
  no , the agreement will be made public before actual voting ( by ep and others ) . 
  i see nobody has mentioned german [ nick knatterton ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgtapxwmzf4&amp;list=pld8ztt3jghrlsi1jrlew245eitji2dwpu ) ( eng sub ) yet , aka [ nikke knatterton : mestarietsiv\u00e4n seikkailut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp8fwuczmyw&amp;list=plprmf2qypldtchtlf55grtiorg2spymu1 ) in finnish , from 1978 . 
  it has quite an unique format . 
  was it aired elsewhere ? 
  youtube seems to only have it in german and finnish , so maybe not . 
  before the testing was standardized some places ( e.g. 
  tampere ) had them every monday . 
  i think this changed to monthly sometime in the last 10 years or so . 
  seems like a simple mistake ( 27 vs 21 ) and then bad luck to me . 
  investigation does not hurt , though . 
  does france actually want external restrictions , though ? 
  i was under the impression that the french `` simply '' want it so that french people using google.com will not see the affected results , and google could still show those results to other people . 
  can someone familiar with the actual text in the french notice to confirm either way ? 
  that was by the microsoft-owned former nokia devices division , which has/had a limited-time license to use the nokia brand . 
  they already do that for some titles , but i think they are in the minority . 
  it is not a technology problem , but a licensing rights issue . 
  for the same reason hbo nordic does n't have any english subtitle options despite many people asking for it . 
  in the past it was also common in netflix that subtitle language was switchable ( nordic languages ) but there was no option to watch without subtitles - i have n't encountered these in a while , though , so does n't seem to happen that much anymore . 
  swedish ` u ' sounds like finnish ` y ' . 
  finnish ` u ' sounds like swedish ` o ' . 
  so if a finnish person were to read `` syrstr\u00f6mming '' it would sound more correct to a swedish person then . 
  feel free to correct me . 
  lost it at the [ `` product placement contains programming '' ] ( https://youtu.be/ovayky9lfrw?t=234 ) notice . 
  to clarify , cat is for ' \u00e4 ' . 
  ( i thought we were talking about ' \u00e5 ' , so maybe others were confused as well  ) . 
  ' \u00f6 ' is like e in `` german '' . 
  ' \u00e5 ' is like a in ` yawn ' ( does n't exist in native finnish words , we just use ` o ' for approx . 
  the same sound ) . 
   a company can be bound by a collective agreement either directly via an agreement with the relevant trade union ( called an ` adoption agreement ' ) or via membership of the relevant employers ' organisation . 
  interestingly , here in finland many collective agreements ( those that are considered representative of sector ) are declared as `` generally applicable '' by the state , so they bind even non-affiliated employers . 
  this results in an even higher coverage of workforce . 
  since denmark apparently does n't have that , i wonder which other countries have a similar system , if any ? 
   i wonder how they got finland and estonia etc. 
  on board . 
  they have to have some sort of collateral for them .
