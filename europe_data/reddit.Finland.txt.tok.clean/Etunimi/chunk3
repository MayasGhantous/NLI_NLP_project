  the 50 billion ? 
  from what i 've understood from reports and reading the statement ( and i could be wrong ) , the agreement mostly details the actions the greek will have to do for there to be ( more ) negotiations . 
  since just `` negotiations '' does n't mean any actual additional liabilities to finland , they were able to accept this agreement as-is . 
  however , the government is [ yet to assess ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/pm_sipila_new_greek_result_step_in_right_direction/8151936 ) if the actions detailed in the new proposal are enough for a loan programme . 
  according to finnish media ( [ yle ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/sipila_kreikka-ehdotus_askel_oikeaan_suuntaan/8151349 ) , [ hs ] ( http://www.hs.fi/talous/a1436751602090 ) , [ yle english ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/pm_sipila_new_greek_result_step_in_right_direction/8151936 ) ) , pm has said that the council of state still has to review the proposal to see if it is deemed adequate , and declined to tell his own opinion on whether it is so . 
  not sure how well it will go in parliament if the council of state deems the proposal acceptable . 
  he said it to the press , did n't send it . 
  i stand corrected , then . 
   `` do they think that governments of other countries should have to collapse and citizens of other countries should have to suffer economic stagnation in order to help bail out greece ? '', 
   it 's literally almost your whole comment . 
  do you know what the phrase `` in order to '' means ? 
  the stagnation he mentioned meant the additional stagnation caused by possible collapse of the government if they tried to push the bailout through , not the current already-existing stagnation which of course is not greece 's fault . 
  i 'm not familiar with the situation of greek administration , but i take # 11 to mean that public authorities and government departments/agencies should not have political positions . 
  the public administration ( civil servants etc ) which implements the law should operate autonomously without political control ( other than politicians writing the law , of course ) . 
  in sweden [ ministerstyre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministerstyre ) ( elected officials directly affecting the work of government departments ) is explicitly forbidden . 
  not sure how far do the greek need to go to have their administration considered `` de-politicized '' , though . 
  not at all typical . 
  if a prominent member ( e.g. 
  a member of parliament ) said them , they would be almost certainly expelled from the party . 
  i had never heard of the quotes or the named persons , but i googled a few names and the quotes seem like something they could say ( though some could be fakes ) . 
  note , though , that at least the people i checked were never voted in for any seats anywhere , and i do n't think they have ever been parliament candidates , either . 
   but at clubs and restaurants , if you are paying cash , they will give you a receipt and return after a couple of minutes for the money . 
  here in restaurants they give you a bill , after which you pay , after which they give you the receipt . 
  interesting , around here receipts are considered `` proof of payment/exchange '' in a sense and by law they are required to contain the used payment method , which would not be possible if handed in advance . 
  if you give it in advance , it is an invoice/bill instead of a receipt . 
  which weirdly is named in the pic `` merivoimat marinen '' , which is just `` navy '' in finnish ( merivoimat ) and swedish ( marinen ) , while the other countries have their english names , which would be `` finnish navy '' for finland . 
  those reports were basically just rumors and speculation that then got re-reported on various sites as something netflix actually did . 
  netflix itself issued a statement that they have n't actually changed their stance , and there have been no reports of anyone actually having gotten banned or anything . 
  i 'm interested , can you provide any specific examples ( or just links ) of regulatory issues affecting startups more in europe ? 
  or is it just the fact that every country has different laws , leading to a small initial market since launching in all of europe simultaneously is difficult ? 
  you seem to have assumed `` must be locked or hidden if nasa does not list the locations '' , but this is a wrong assumption for * many * countries , e.g. 
  finland : * apollo 17 fragment is publicly shown in the [ mineralogical museum of the geological survey of finland ] ( http://www.gtk.fi/geologia/geonayttelyt/espoo/ ) . 
  * apollo 11 fragment is publicly shown in the [ urho kekkonen museum ] ( http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/ukk_museum ) . 
  these links have good lists of the status of moon rocks - though they do n't say whether they are publicly displayed , just their location , so one ca n't really use them as a direct source for this map : http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_apollo11.html http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_goodwill.html, 
  dst is +1 h ( clock is one hour ahead ) , so you go to work * earlier * in the morning , and thus it is * darker * with dst . 
  reverse when coming back from work , of course , though . 
   nesa [ national emergency supply agency ] ( http://www.nesa.fi/ ) . 
  in the ops mentioned case ( [ alexander stubb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_stubb ) , pm of finland ) : it did n't really matter at all at pre-election time , and certainly he did not get votes due to it . 
   very impressive preparations . 
  quite impressive on paper , yes , not sure if everything would actually work as expected during a crisis situation , though - could the shelters be readied in time , would the equipment actually work ( or even exist ) , etc. . . or if the [ national emergency supply agency ] ( http://www.nesa.fi/ ) has its things in order . 
   are the finns concerned about sweden 's complete unpreparedness ? 
  in general , not really . 
  people know that sweden 's preparedness is generally worse than that of finland 's , but that 's it - i guess it is not really considered that big of an issue since the russians would come to finland from the east , and we 'd need more than just swedish support anyway to hold them off for any significant amount of time . 
   move to emergency shelter inside the apartment house fyi for non-finns , building codes in finland require basically all apartment buildings and other big buildings to have reinforced emergency shelters , usually built into the basement , for e.g. 
  war , nuclear fallout and gas attacks ( their required equipment include geiger counters , first-aid supplies , pioneer equipment , a/c machine with filters , manuals , chemical toilets , etc. . . ) . 
  there are approx . 
  50000 civil defence shelters that can shelter 3.8 million people in total ( 70 % of population - cities have better coverage than rural areas ) . 
  of course , in the op 's situation they would have limited use , since they are usually in other use during peace time ( they have to be ready within 72h of an order ) . 
  good info in english is limited , but [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_defense_in_finland ) wikipedia article has an ok ( though quite outdated ) summary . 
   they have the same rule that they wo n't sell kindles abroad ( or to denmark at least ) . 
  officially you have to buy it from the us . 
  or get it from a third party . 
  i think they stopped doing that some time ago , one should be able to order a kindle from either amazon.co.uk or amazon.de now , at least it worked to finland . 
  tv rights wrt . 
  netflix are not really a question of different regulatory environments per se , though . 
  it is just that each country has their own tv channels and it is most of the time more profitable to sell a new series to them individually than to e.g. 
  netflix ( or even sell to just some channels in the larger countries ) . 
  the only way to avoid that that i see is disallowing regional tv rights contracts altogether . 
  or is there some other way i 'm not seeing ? 
  unifying the regulatory environments would probably , however , allow more netflix competitors to appear . 
  but that does n't mean netflix could suddenly get a better library , afaics . 
  well , tax free is nowadays only if you stop at \u00c5land islands ( which is outside eu tax area ) , not for helsinki - tallinn as estonia is in eu too , and going via \u00c5land would be a bit of a detour  . 
  but i think you pay estonian taxes on the ferry instead of the finnish ones so the alcohol is still cheaper . 
  that is correct , and here is an english-language finnish news article : http://yle.fi/uutiset/ylivieska_church_destroyed_in_fire_suspected_arson/8770925, 
   a business lunch can be 10 $ for a two course meal and takes a while to be served . 
  here they currently cost 8-10 $ and are most often buffets so there is no waiting time . 
  if you need to order the wait time is usually max 10 min or so . 
  some background for others : this is because you can get a tractor license at 15y while regular driving license requires 18y . 
  15y also applies to light motorcycles , scooters , and [ motorized quadricycles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motorised_quadricycle ) ( microcars ) which in urban areas are more common among young people than tractors . 
  ah , for reference i 'm from pirkanmaa . 
  interesting , i 'm only familiar with the last two . 
  maybe due to regional differences as the ones from the [ other finnish subthread ] ( / r/europe/comments / 49ivnw/what _ are_some_sayings_that_are_specific_to_your / d0s7ir0 ) were all familiar to me . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.eduskunta.fi/_layouts/15/arkena.edk.salivideo/index.html#clip_id=2fc2d1ae&amp;position=0&amp;tab=conferencecurrent ) ( no english subtitles ) . 
  ( they are in finlandia hall instead of the parliament house due to renovations ), 
  yes , all . 
   it was not an agreement . 
  it was just a mutual , talked between friends , understanding between finland and sweden that we would apply for eu membership simultaneously . 
  then suddenly sweden applied and finland was caught by the pants down surprise , and there was no option but to apply for a membership asap . 
  well , it was actually more complicated for finland than that , if i have understood correctly . 
  at the time there were ongoing negotiations with eec ( [ european economic community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) , the eu precursor ) and efta ( [ european free trade association ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association ) ) to establish the eea ( [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) ) . 
  finland feared that with sweden applying for eec membership those negotiations could fall apart , which would have been very bad for finland as they would n't be able to follow sweden to eec due to their [ yya treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) with the soviet union and finland would be left out entirely . 
  swedish government had promised that they would tell finland in advance if they were to decide to apply to eec amidst the negotiations , and had assured to finns on several occasions that they were n't planning on applying to eec . 
  despite that they announced in oct 1990 that they had deviced to apply , without consulting or informing finland . 
  later soviet union collapsed and the yya treaty was voided in january 1992 , allowing finland to apply for eec membership too .

  [ wikipedia link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) . 
  no , they are normally either studded tires that are illegal to use during the summer , or studless winter tires ( `` kitkarenkaat '' ) that would perform poorly and wear quickly during summers ( though legal to use , and some people do ) . 
  studded tires are the traditional and most common choice . 
  both of them have better winter performance than all-year tyres . 
  heavy vehicles ( trucks etc ) often use all-year tires , though . 
  ca n't answer your question ( sorry ) , but keep in mind that those people have likely just come out of a [ 80-110 \u00b0 c ( 176 -- 230 \u00b0 f ) sauna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_sauna ) . 
  as mentioned in the article , rolling in the snow etc. 
  after sauna is not unusual . 
  according to the article this would cover trains , buses , planes , taxis , and car + bicycle rentals , whatever that might mean in practice . 
  imo they are right . 
  not-perfect net neutrality is much better than no net neutrality at all ( which is the current situation ) , so calling it a victory seems fine . 
  there is a [ pes\u00e4pallo world cup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pes%c3%a4pallo_world_cup ) , though finland has won all the gold medals in all the 8 tournaments so far so the pes\u00e4pallo following is likely very small in the other countries ... australia , finland , germany and switzerland participated in this year 's cup . 
  past participants include estonia , japan , south australia , and sweden .

  sure , but plugs do n't tend to fail here .
