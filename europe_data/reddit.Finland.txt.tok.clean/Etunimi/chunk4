  i 've never encountered one nor heard of one failing ( though i guess it still happens * sometimes * ) . 
  headphone plugs etc break relatively often , but not ac power plugs . 
  actually , if you order items sold by amazon eu , amazon will charge your local vat ( which also means the order total will be slightly more/less depending on your location ) . 
  of course , amazon will still keep the profits so money still goes out . 
  i do n't think logistics are an issue , as amazon already fulfills all european orders by shipping them from any of their european warehouses . 
  for example , regardless of whether i order from . co.uk , . de , . fr , . it or . es , almost everything sold by amazon gets shipped to me from uk by royal mail ( small items ) or from germany by dhl ( larger items ) anyway . 
  if i use express shipping , they usually ship from uk by ups regardless of which amazon site i made the order on . 
  note , though , that ordering from amazon.com you will prepay all the vat and customs fees at checkout if you select an amazonglobal shipping method ( which are actually the only shipping methods available to most european countries for non-media products ) . 
  the carrier will then handle all the import stuff in eu and either get the item directly to you or send it to you as a regular eu-internal postal parcel . 
   books do ship , but e.g. 
  clothing does not . 
  i 've ordered various clothing products many times from amazon.com , they ship them just fine to europe . 
  many 3rd-party sellers do n't ship internationally , though , so i tend to look at mostly amazon-sold products . 
  if you meant * subtitling * of live speech , that is indeed not done here , but no dubbing either . 
  having live foreign speech in news is very rare , but the host would just explain what was said afterwards . 
   ( postal code hoh oho ) his postal code in finland is * [ 99999 ] ( http://www.verkkoposti.com/e3/english/postalcodecatalog?streetname=&amp;postcodeorcommune=99999 ) * . 
  the price for 1gbps here is usually 50-100 eur/mo , when available . 
  i pay 50 eur/mo for 250/100 mbps . 
  with the current 1 mbps universal service subscriptions the law mandates minimum 750 kbps average over 24 hours and minimum 500 kbps average over 4 hours . 
  i 'd guess something similar would be put into place with 100m , but i think that is n't happening in the very near future , anyway . 
  - dna [ universal broadband subscription ] ( https://www.dna.fi/dna-yleispalvelulaajakaista ) price is not mentioned , but is mobile and without data cap ( 1 mbps ) . 
  - elisa universal broadband subscription is [ 37,90 eur/mo ] ( http://elisa.fi/attachment/content/yleispalveluliittym__internet_hinnasto_20130613_fi.pdf ) ( note : 3 years old data ) ( no data cap , mobile or adsl , 1 mbps ) , starting fee 129 eur , starting fee if adsl repeater needed 429 eur , plus customer specific network building fee . 
  network building fee has to be reasonable as well . 
  the provider may request state subsidy for larger network building costs . 
  note that you would only order one of these if you live somewhere that has no 3g mobile phone coverage at all as the universal service subscriptions are much costlier than regular services ( but still pretty fair , compared to not having internet at all ) . 
  as can be seen in e.g. 
  [ elisa 's coverage map ] ( http://elisa.fi/kuuluvuus/ ) there are n't too many places like that . 
  for comparison , regular [ elisa mobile broadband ] ( https://kauppa.saunalahti.fi/#!/nettiliittymat/mobiililaajakaista ) is ( all with no data caps ) : * 21 mbps 14,90 eur/mo , * 50 mbps 21,90 eur/mo , * 100 mbps 29,80 eur/mo , * 300 mbps 49,90 eur/mo . 
  relevant gallery of the larger shelters used for sports : http://imgur.com/a/qkxon apartment building shelters are of course smaller .

  sonera 's [ coverage map ] ( https://www.sonera.fi/asiakastuki/ohjeet/peittoaluekartta?id=1398 ) says 50mbps 4g for the address of [ siperia lapponica ] ( http://www.siperia.eu/ ) ( currently down , over bandwidth limit ) , their sleg dog safari business . 
  you mean municipalities ( * kunta * ) , not counties ( * maakunta , kreivikunta , piirikunta * ) . 
   you could say they 're impeding the free market , but at the same time i can see how it would be unfair to go to some random carrier in , say , estonia with the best offer and then go off and use a durch carrier 's ( probably much more expensive to maintain ) network . 
  the estonian carrier still has to pay to the dutch carrier at the regulated wholesale roaming prices . 
  so these provisions protect the estonian carrier , not the dutch one . 
  a delegation of the parliament of finland visited north korea in april 1975 , which is from where this ( real ) photo is . 
  kekkonen was n't personally there , as far as i know , though . 
  the original poster is a researcher of the archives of the organizations of the national coalition party , so presumably he just dug it up from the archives . 
  edit : and [ kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) is quite a legendary president who served 26 years - jokingly sometimes referred to as a dictator of sorts . 
  the president had much more power back then . 
  during summers it was regularly over 90 \u00b0 f in my small apartment in finland so i bought a/c a couple of years back . 
  outdoors was not quite as hot , though . 
  i think the post was specifically about `` cities '' , i.e. 
  places that are actually called cities , not just being the equivalent of one . 
  so it would rule out all swedish municipalities  ( per [ wikipedia ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/stad_ ( sverige \\ ) ) `` sverige har s\u00e5ledes inga st\u00e4der i kommunalr\u00e4ttslig mening '' ) . 
  if city-equivalents like municipalities would be counted , there would be larger ones in finland , too ( inari is 17 333,65 km \u00b2 ) . 
  there is no legal difference between a municipality and a city in finland , either , but any municipality can call themselves a city ( and have a city council instead of municipality council , etc ) . 
  yes , though it is not something one would actually use and is very hard to decode even for finns because of the amount of inflections ( ? ), 
  it has . 
  ep\u00e4j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llistytt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6myydell\u00e4\u00e4ns\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00f6h\u00e4n = maybe not even with their state of not having been arranged to have desystematized ? 
  edit : the grandparent commenter updated their word to a longer one based on `` systematize '' ( j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llist\u00e4\u00e4 ) instead of `` organize '' ( j\u00e4rjest\u00e4\u00e4 ) , so i 've updated the above breakdown to match . 
   also , i saw one word beginning with ` yht ' or something like that , which , really , really impressed and confused me . 
  y in finnish is ipa [ y ] , i.e. 
  the same as the vowel sound in the end of the english word `` few '' . 
  i guess this makes it make more sense ? 
  there has been no change . 
  we too use local bank systems similar to ideal for online purchases at local websites . 
  not as standardized , though - every bank has their own system , and then there are services that bundle them together like ideal does ( so the retailer does not need to support all banks by themselves ) . 
  however , finnish debit cards are all mastercard debit , visa debit , or visa electron cards , which are all accepted by all amazon sites ( and other international websites that accept visa/mastercard ) so there is no big issue here and no credit cards are needed . 
  i guess netherlands has their own local debit card system instead ? 
  there are 4 multilingual amazon sites : - amazon canada has english and french . 
  - amazon china has chinese and english . 
  - amazon germany has dutch , english , german , polish , and turkish . 
  - amazon japan has chinese , english , and japanese . 
  other amazon sites only support a single language . 
  they seem to be slowly moving in that direction with [ amazon.de ] ( https://www.amazon.de/ ) . 
  in the last couple of years they 've added dutch , english , polish , and turkish language options and added quite a few countries to their [ free standard delivery program ] ( https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeid=201910160 ) ( currently austria , belgium , czech republic , denmark , finland , germany , hungary , liechtenstein , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , slovakia , sweden , switzerland , turkey ) . 
  note that this map is a bit over 16 years old . 
  those indeed look more like uncontrolled airfields than `` proper '' airports , finland also has over 50 of those ( with icao codes , most without iata codes ) in addition to the 25 regular airports . 
   21 civilian airports well , actually 25 airports with civilian flights as 4 are combined military + civilian airports ( and 2 of those combo airports , tampere and rovaniemi , are in top 4 in finnish civilian passenger air traffic , so i 'd say they should count ) . 
   which makes sense , since using a credit card is accompanied by a 2-5 % fee . 
  i guess they may vary by country , but at least in finland the fees are way lower than that , and for debit cards ( which most people use ) even lower . 
  not the case for finland at least , having a beer or two is socially acceptable here if you are under the limit . 
  relevant username : * tissit * = * tits * in finnish . 
  district cooling is a thing in finland at least . 
  the first network started in 1998 and the cooling networks have been expanding since then . 
  finnish pm also flies his trips regularly , smaller jets than 737 though . 
  there was no country code in finnish plates before 2001 . 
  sf was usually in an oval sticker ( [ example ] ( http://www.urhoklubi.net/tumpolan_kunta/autotalo/autot/talbot_solara/talbot_2.jpg ) ) when a country code was required .

  yes , roaming got a lot cheaper ( ~ 90 % cheaper than the previous limit , even with these authorized surcharges ) . 
  note that retail roaming charges are not completely abolished . 
  there are some exceptions , the last one of which is rarely mentioned ( not mentioned in op link either ) : - if you are permanently roaming or primarily roaming , charges may be applied . 
  - unlimited data over ( plan_price / 7.70 $ / gb * 2 ) per month may be charged roaming fees . 
  - in specific and exceptional circumstances , with a view to ensuring the sustainability of its domestic charging model , where a roaming provider is not able to recover its overall actual and projected costs of providing regulated roaming services in accordance with articles 6a and 6b , from its overall actual and projected revenues from the provision of such services , that roaming provider may apply for authorisation to apply a surcharge . 
  ( 531/2012 article 6c , as amended by 2015/2120 ) all three big operators in finland have applied for such an authorization . 
  we 'll know whether they get them later today . 
  dna and elisa are currently listing roaming prices that assume the authorizations are granted . 
  edit 2 : authorizations were granted to elisa , telia , dna , moi : [ four operators authorised to apply roaming surcharges ] ( https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/ficora/news/2017/fouroperatorsauthorisedtoapplyroamingsurcharges.html ) edit : finnish regulatory authority 's relevant details page ( english version ) : [ roam for less in the eu from 15 june 2017 - you only pay the domestic price or a small surcharge ] ( https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/internettelephone/usingamobilephoneabroad/eupricecap.html ) they also say `` this exception aims to ensure that there will be large low-cost packages with unlimited data available in finland in the future , as well .
