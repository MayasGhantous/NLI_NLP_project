  this is amazing , slovenia doing their thing better every year . 
  southern and western provinces are beer and wine finland and most of the finns live there so that 's explains that . 
  there is still so called vodka finland in northern and eastern parts though .

  fredrik reinfeldt is having a staring contest with putin while norway is laughing and finland is derping between . 
  iceland just farted and i do n't know what the hell is going on in denmark . 
  that 's how we roll in the north . 
  you are right and do n't be sorry , 
  my favourite estonian word is nahkhiir which means bat . 
  if you break the word you get nahk = skin and hiir = mouse . 
  so bats are mouses with extra skin ( wings ) . 
  til that i love snert,

  ah the good old soviet card . 
  populism at its finest . 
  as a lactose intolerant i can only imagine how putin 's office was filled with toxic lactose fart gasses and putin was like jesus h. christ did someone died here . 
  then he took his gas mask from his book cabinet and called the important people and yelled them behind his mask with muffled sound that he ca n't tolerant the lactose intolerant , this western lingering double death fart smell , and ordered some lactose free milk . 
  true story . 
  maybe someone did and that 's why it 's in the bottom of the gulf of bothnia, 
  that awkward handshake tells more than thousand words . 
  while you are figuring that out , maybe you can give so examples how finland is supporting russian aggression like you said ? 
   russian standards are very high ... as seen on youtube, 
  see kids , you ca n't argue against science !, 
  the picture i 'm seeing is showing niinist\u00f6 and poroshenko,

  capital city helsinki vs. the rest of the finland . 
  people from the north call southerns ( helsinki , turku and tampere ) lazy ( etel\u00e4nvetel\u00e4 / southern sloppy ) and less manly because we do n't live in the mercy of nature 24/7 . 
   ireland , iceland and uk are north-western europe do n't you dare take our iceland !, 
  in finland midsummer day ( juhannus in finnish ) is the most important holiday of the year . 
  it 's basically same kind of festive than in sweden .

  lutefisk ( lipe\u00e4kala or livekala in finnish ) is traditional christmas delicacy in western finland .

  i think that stubb 's political rhetoric here is just to say that i have n't changed my opinion . 
  he is showing that he stays behind his words . 
  it 's more a personal/party thing than something that affects the political climate as a whole right now .

  in finland we call this pl\u00f6r\u00f6 .

  pour vodka ( koskenkorva ) until you can see the coin again 4 . 
  drink 5 .
