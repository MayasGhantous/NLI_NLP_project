  hi is here to lead not to read . 
  well that was wrong on some many levels , but hey thanks . 
  i love inuit people . 
  i can tell you right now how we perform in the world cup . 
  we do n't perform at all . 
  it 's a fucking disaster every time for us . 
  we ca n't even get into the world cup . 
  am i nationalistic enough ? 
  well swedish mora knife is like an official national knife in finland . 
  i was fishing last weekend and i still have my dads 30 + year old mora with me . 
  some factoids : 2005 -- 2014 there was a total of 17 violations of finnish airspace . 
  six of them was from russia . 
  yesterday suddenly two different russian planes crossed the border . 
  people were reporting sonic booms around the southern finland because finnish air force immediately deployed fighters . 
  and . . that 's pretty much it . 
  [ this thing ] ( http://accessreel.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_content_image/public/field/image/hugh_jackman_wolverine.jpg?itok=bajrljbc** ) was scavenging my trash can last night, 
  so after 73 million years finland is bigger than earth !, 
  we will overgrown everything like a cancer . 
  but . . but . . what about tallinn and my cheap booze ? 
  in my nightmares i can see all the alcoholic treasures in the bottom of the sea . 
  surstr\u00f6mming also melt your face , so after that it does n't matter how much sea level is rising . 
  daaamn , jesus is huge, 
  wow ... well i do n't know why you did n't know this but what really happened was that first russia annexed crimea and then they voted . 
   i mean , should europe take seriously a country which is so threatened by a bearded drag queen ? 
  austria was 3rd in russian [ televoting ] ( http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=1893&amp;voter=ru ) so it 's not the country . 
  it 's just your loud and ignorant leaders maybe ?

  this logo is from 1930 's . 
  how the hell people taking cover look relaxed ? 
  they look shocked to me . 
  [ in before ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/kungsgatan_1967.jpg ) sweden ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ youuuuuu, 
  telegraph is notoriously known as anti eu and euro zone . 
  or is it just bogs natural ability to preserve bodies and other organic stuff like leather armors and wool clothes . 
  because snowden is well known character in europe and usa and this `` ama uncle putin via internet '' was a huge propaganda show . 
  only civilized alcoholics go to finland-\u00c5land-sweden ferry trip so it 's not a problem . 
  * ria novosti ( russian : \u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) is the largest news agency in russia . 
  operating under the purview on the russian ministry of communications and mass media . 
  * so , yeah . 
  well it 's from itar-tass so everything they say should be in quotation marks . 
  `` they are calling me the country 's chief propagandist , which indicates either madness or ignorance on their part . '', 
  keep it classy chief propagandist !, 
  calling everybody mad is not a way to prove that you 're not a propagandist . 
  talking about unions , how 's the weather in london btw ? 
  i offer you faroe islands also because today i can !, 
  i wonder why ... 
  this is true , but it 's more like recommendation . 
  so what this means to pm erdogan 's authority ? 
  how alliance with finland is a risk or/and trouble ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  one thing 's sure : this is out of the box thinking if anything . 
  take that putin , you did n't foresee this happening . 
  [ take that uk ! ],

  oh albania , your excellent sarcasm hurt russia more than any sanctions . 
  to be honest , these are valid points . 
  corruption in southern europe ( not to mention any countries , but you know who you are ) is insane if you compare it to nordic countries . 
  it 's a huge problem to eu 's integrity and credibility as a whole . 
  and natural gas . . and wood . . and cruel oil . . and ... 
  widescreen is cutting off the nordic countries again . 
  i demand 4:3 !, 
  that 's why in democratic countries media is often called the fourth estate . 
  its most important function is to control the state . 
  you make it sound like a bad thing . 
  how the hell this is even possible to get wrong, 
  why do n't you shut up and keep stuffing your innovations in my whore mouth !, 
  so how we calculate us democracy if eu is in the equation ? 
  lapland and finnmark ca n't into democracy ? 
  fun fact about vienna : [ `` in 1910 , vienna had more than two million inhabitants , and was the fourth largest city in europe after london , paris and berlin '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna#demographics ), 
  it 's funny how people only see them as a group of disabled people who only wants pity and sensation . 
  pertti kurikan nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t is pretty solid punk band as you said . 
  they make their own songs and lyrics and so on . 
  is punk something that people want to see in eurovision song contest is the real `` problem '' . 
  not . 
  the . 
  same . 
  colours . 
  i really do n't know much about historical relations between transylvania and hungary so i ca n't answer your question how this is related to my message . 
  vi is an old germanic word meaning holy ( like in visby ) and borg is of course a castle . 
  so in english it 's holy castle . 
  kingdom of sweden founded viipuri/viborg in 1293 against novogord . 
  russia did n't exist until late 1400 in that area . 
  1710-1812 it was a part of russian empire and 1812-1917 part of grand duchy of finland . 
  in the 1947 paris peace treaties , finland relinquished all claims to viipuri/viborg .

  i approve this picture . 
  viborg in swedish .

   russia might be shitty neighbor in many ways , but at least their border guards do their fucking job . 
  [ syrian migrants cycle to norway border ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/04/syrian-migrants-cycle-to-norway-border/ ), 
  i do n't know any polish but now i know how to znaku x my favourite candidate if i ever immigrate to poland . 
  as a finn it 's just absurd to think that gerald r. ford-class aircraft carrier can carry up to 90 planes . 
  it 's like whole finnish air force and more in one ship which you can park almost everywhere in the world . 
   support united finnish nation and one true christian faith and make sure there are no heretic programs undermining national unity yeah and this is a good idea because lunatic crazy news is the best news . 
  that was coming out of left field but right on !, 
  80 hours in space means 80 years on earth .
