  short post soviet history : * on 27 may 1993 , homosexual acts between consenting males were legalised * * in 1999 , homosexuality was formally removed from the list of russian mental disorders ( due to endorsing icd-10 , which removed homosexuality in 1990 ) . 
  * [ icd-10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icd-10 ) * on 8 may 2009 , russian duma rejected a bill criminalizing gay `` propaganda '' in russia ( with only 90 votes in favor against 226 minimum required ) . 
  * * in june 2013 , russia passed a federal law banning the distribution of `` propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships '' to minors . 
  article 6.21 of the code of the russian federation on administrative offenses was approved by the state duma in a 436-0 vote prior to being signed in by vladimir putin . 
  putin 's justifications for it are to promote `` traditional russian values '' in opposition of western state liberalism in regards to homosexuality , `` protect the children , '' and to boost russia 's falling birthrate .
