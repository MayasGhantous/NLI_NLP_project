  you 're right , but the point is that in finnish perussuomalainen does n't mean sannfinnl\u00e4ndarna . 
  typiskt finl\u00e4ndare is better translation . 
  it really is a provocative name and i hate it . 
  i do n't know for sure , but they probably came up with this english name when first `` true finns '' were elected to eu parliament . 
  also true finns is a bullshit translation because in finnish perussuomalainen means something like average or basic finn .

  unhealthy food is unhealthy in europe too . 
  it 's just a stupid stereotype to think that everything you eat in usa is fattening and terrible to your health . 
  imo the problem is the unhealthy food in usa is very cheap and it 's just a easy way to satisfy your nomnom needs . 
  it does n't mean that americans ca n't eat healthy or your food culture in general is bad . 
  yeah , baltic [ lada-class ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lada-class_submarine ) ( and i 'm not kidding ) submarine is now a selling point because the finnish borderguards can hear them .

  good luck !, 
  i agree everything you said . 
  there is no shame taking a dump in outhouse . 
  most of the finns have done it ( including me ) in their summer cottages and rural homes and everybody is happy . 
  i do n't see any problem .

  i also remember seeing some brave ones enjoying a bottle of mennen and licking deodorants . 
  of course it 's bad for your digestion , but at least your breath is minty fresh and you do n't go blind . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  also talka is talkoot in finnish . 
  it 's a baltic loanword . 
  fun fact . 
  in finnish `` suri '' means that someone mourns for something that is lost in the past .

  i know emotion now . 
  emotion strong . 
  what is emotion ? 
   agrarian parties are a bit like communist party in china what ? 
  from the wikipedia : `` the ideology of the party is unusual in the european context . 
  unlike many other large parties in europe its ideology is not primarily based on economic systems . 
  rather the ideas of humanity , education , the spirit of the land , peasant-like freedom , decentralization , `` the issue of poor people '' , environmentalism and progressivism play a key role in centrist politician speeches and writings . 
  from the very beginning of its presence , the party has supported the idea of decentralisation . '',

  now he is between two worlds . 
  your move lukashenko . 
  i just hope that this stupid game between europe ( eu ) , and russia ends . 
  of course it 's a big deal because belarus is known to have close relations with mother russia . 
  maybe he just figured out that we live in year 2015 and annexing other nations is so 1900 's . 
   i feel european , i feel at home all over the continent , and i 'm a french european . 
  wise words and overall very good post .
