  what i read from his comment was that communism and capitalism are both equally bad . 
  nobody said that capitalism has n't ever led to anything bad . 
  he did write a few things that were i believe to be outright wrong there ( manifest destiny , the third world problems ) . 
  ( to be honest i had forgotten that this started from banning parties not being democratic lol , he has sayed a lot else now . ), 
   `` you are no better than an holocaust denier . '', 
  ** [ +4 now ] ** i 'm not really that convinced by his arguments over the other guy 's . 
  i 'd say that my feeling about them being right or wrong is 50/50 . 
  homewer , that ending was ... yeah . 
  a bit extreme . 
   `` i have n't denied anything . '', 
  ** [ now -3 ] ** ( the guy indeed has n't denied a fucking thing ! ), 
  his text could feel like it viewed communism and capitalism both as bad . 
  and arguably , communism is worse , is the more common opinion . 
  the biggest cause of downvotes here is the rest of the comment , i think : '' ... the only one denying anything is you , with your whitewashing and dishonest revisionism . 
  you are no better than an holocaust denier . 
  by actively denying the crimes of capitalism and the inherit evil of it , you are no better than the mass murderers of history and their cohorts . '', 
  which used the template thingy again . 
  the other person did call the other a holocaust denier first , but is it really mature to call the person a holocaust denier back ? 
  kodiakus also called him a revisionist and whitewasher ( carries same meaning as holocaust denier ? ) . 
  indeed , kodiakus did n't deny anything . 
  the other fella should n't have made the foreboding that he would deny/had denied . 
  another thing , kodiakus ' comment had this template text , nut not anything else . 
  the other guy had wrotes some argument along with his . 
  in my opinion , they both were wrong on that one . 
   put that anywhere else , in another context , that 's not the results you would get i dunno . 
  i mean , i kinda addressed this point , did n't i ( i 'm kinda tired right now ) ? 
  the guys had more stuff to their comments than what you quoted , in my opinion ( no insult to you implied ) . 
   but on a thread about ukraine people do n't up - or down-vote based on their opinion , it 's all about `` downvoting the pro-putin '' and basically anything that suggests kiev may also be playing a dangerous game . 
  we all pretty much agree that putin is a. . . well , the less said the better . 
  i have seen some comments that speak about kiev critically upvoted ( my personal opinion on kiev : let 's wait and see ) . 
  sometimes people have a ` which one of these represents my side ? ', 
  - view on the comments . 
  there might also be some blaming and such because of the claims of [ pro-kremlim bots ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/04/pro-russia-trolls-ukraine-guardian-online ) , you might 've seen that linked to in here . 
   whatever happens in the news , you must blame it on putin and condone anything that comes from the ukrainian side , if you try to act otherwise , someone will get into a silly argument with you and will be mechanically upvoted . 
  no discussion allowed , it 's all about showing you how stupid you are . 
  i do n't think it 's quite * that * severe . 
  as long as one writes his/her comments based on facts and trustworthy links , does n't get too emotional , does n't insult anybody etc. 
  one would n't get that much downvotes , maybe even upvotes in my opinion . 
  i do n't think that thread served as much proof of otherwise stuff . 
  goddamn , i wrote long . 
  must be my longest writing in reddit , yet . 
  maybe that essay on fenno-russo relations was longer . 
  to be fair , if the members of the russian military were unarmed military observers it could 've gone differently . 
  officially eastern ukraine is ukrainian territory still , so if ukraine has given permission to the german unarmed military observers to be there , well , they can . 
  same to russia , i think . 
  but if russia were harboring rebel troops with them ... 
  i honestly do n't see much point in that . 
  the rebels could pass through the cities just fine by themselves , in fact even better . 
  and it seemed like one of the ukrainians had a map with him , marking enemy positions in there ? 
  i do n't think such things would be necessary for rebel soldiers , since the ukrainian soldier locations would be more clear ( military bases ) . 
  it could be argued that the 5 ukrainians with the germans were there to provide security , were they armed ? 
  hmm . 
  but they were from a member country of osce , and military observers ? 
  so they had something to do with osce at least ? 
  the egyptians had slavery . 
  the romans had slavery . 
  the africans had slavery ( even before european trade and colonialization ) . 
  slavery was n't and is n't a result of capitalism . 
  what happened here was members of the communist party being thrown out of a session for preventing the session from starting . 
  nobody was thrown out of the parlament . 
  i 'm pretty sure major newsoutlets like the bbc would correct a lie . 
  unless you 're saying that bbc lied intentionally , which i very much doubt . 
  from where did you find out this `` truth '' ? 
  [ some newsarticles ] ( http://bbc.com/news/world-europe-27265927 ) [ that claim ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/04/freed-osce-observers-ordeal-capture-ukraine ) [ otherwise . 
  ] ( http://english.cntv.cn/2014/04/20/vide1397952963483796.shtml ), 
  then again ... 
  it all could be just a cover-up ? 
  / r/conspiracy, 
  true that . 
  people get really riled up when the whole subject of ukraine is brought up . 
  of course , they should control themselves a bit . 
  actually providing proper sources in one 's comments and not flatly denying stuff without anything to back one 's claims usually get one downvoted . 
  also , the way i see it , there 's a pro-ukraine circlejerk and a pro-russia circlejerk here , depending on the time and place . 
  i do n't think it 's constructive to belittle comments and commentors who have conflicting views compared to one 's own views with made up quotes loosely based on what their views are , as is tradition in reddit . 
  still , / r/europe is in general more sensible and open to discussion than many other subs in my opinion . 
  still on osce mission . 
   oh , and also according to wikipedia [ stlekov is into role games and posting in social networks ... quite a gru colonel ] ( http://censor.net.ua/photo_news/283194/komandir_donetskih_terroristov_girkin_slujit_v_fsb_lyubit_rekonstruktsii_i_drujit_s_geyami_fotoreportaj ) to be fair , his hobbies do n't really prove anything about his profession . 
  hitler ( i know , i know , godwin 's law ) loved dogs , painted , and was a vegetarian . 
  i 've never imagined every fbi agent doing stuff like boxing / shooting practice on his free time ( as a hobby ) . 
  but russia * is * a propaganda ridden state . 
  almost all media outlets are owned by the state , and they have clearly biased articles and sometimes dubious sources . 
  what are you basing your views of most finns being russophobes ? 
  rt articles ? 
  next you 're going to say that finns are bitter of sweden 's colonialization and reign . 
  and what the flying fuck , we 're siding with nazis ? 
  to get back at the russians ? 
  are you aware how ridiculous that sounds ? 
  `` oh , you do n't agree with me ? 
  you must be a bitter racist then . 
  may i also remind you that your country allied with nazi germany during ww2 ? '', 
  i 'd like to think that you 're joking , but it seems like you 've also downvoted me . 
  well , maybe you have n't . 
  maybe it was a lurker passing by . 
  who knows ? 
  i have a really hard time being convinced by a liveleak article that the ukrainian government is completely neo-nazi fascist . 
  i have n't seen much ukrainian propaganda yet , even though i 'm subsribed to / r/propagandaposters . 
  i guess that russian propaganda is that much sexier to them . 
  edit : why all the downvotes ? 
  i have n't seen it . 
  at least tell me why you find this comment downvote worthy .
