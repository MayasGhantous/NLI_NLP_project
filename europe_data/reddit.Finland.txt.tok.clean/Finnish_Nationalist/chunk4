  guess i should 've wrote eu . 
  russia also has a lot more drug-usage than europe . 
  does n't bother people from there saying that europe is a drug haven . 
  nope , [ den still glider in . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9aosff98wg ), 
  because we are so much better !, 
  f-feels good ... man , i-i 'm tearing up here , * sniff * , t-take that sweden . 
  hey , niinist\u00f6 is a paragon of virtue and non-corruption !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ compared ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ italian ^ ^ ^ ^ politician, 
  `` united '' , 1 ~ ~ = ~ ~ 52, 
  because amerifat . 
  also , i think eu has n't got croatia in this one . 
  damn americans, 
  * `` your toilet looks like it needs a goood , long plumbing , ma'am '' *, 
  that 'll end fine and well for snowden . 
  what are they protesting , exactly ? 
  also , what do the signs read ? 
  he was talking about the mpa of ukraina . 
  i did n't get it myself until somebody mentioned it in this thread . 
  i did n't know what he was referencing to with that `` i do n't honestly know anymore '' . 
  36 attempts . 
  i missed a couple small countries , plus those kyrgy - and tajitistan . 
  i was making a joke about how belarus is a satellite state of russia . 
  cairo , you mean the finnish cairo , the egyptian cairo or some other ? 
  i thought he was talking about belarus . 
  well , they both fit ? 
  why not meowmaow ? 
  well , i 'll be damned . 
  i was making a joke how your flag is now canada 's flag . 
  i know that if i hover over it with my mouse it read `` ununited tinycountriesthatwillsoonbreakofffromtheunion of america '' . 
  for shame , canada . 
  one 'd think that you would know the difference between your second national language , french , and german . 
  edit : nevermind , canada is right . 
  look at the islands north of japan . 
  they sure did n't belong to china , as far as i know . 
  i 'd reckon that this map is based on ... what russia got and china lost ? 
   upon handing over the gift , merkel said the map was the first precise map of china drawn in germany in 1735 . 
  for some people who did n't read the article and ca n't figure out why 'd merkel do what she did based on the title . 
  no , norwegian !, 
  think about the danes and how they 'll feel about that !, 
  to be stuck as a swede for the rest of eternity ... * shudders *, 
  you sure gave up quickly on norway , mister danish person . 
  how peculiar of a dane to call finland eastern sweden ... 
  most of the time it 's only swedes who are arrogant enough to do that . 
  well , shows how much i know about faroe islands . 
  holly up 'em gagoddas , eh ? 
  i think it 's finland but with a red stripe to imply communism . 
  the mods really botched that one up , they could 've used the [ official communist flag representative ] ( http://imgur.com/5nqxopl ) . 
  well , it 's allright . 
  i did n't expect any knowledge of geographical accuracy from a canadian . 
  oh man , the communist flag does n't feel that bad now . 
  edit : it 's faroe islands . 
  til . 
  you 're canadian , allright . 
  all thanks to the usa , millions of canadians everyday are forced to suffer from being mistaked as americans . 
  edit : to whoever did that thing to the finnish flag flair : i swear something is going to happen for your alcohol storages . 
  yeah , geographically stationed between countries that try to stay neutral and peacefull . 
  in ww2 , all of those neighbours got attacked ( norway and denmark got annexed , finland survived due to natural finnish superiority ) , just sweden got away all nice and peacefull !, 
  indeed , the swiss do have army knives . 
  thank god that we managed to single-handedly drive them away 200 years ago . 
  otherwise we 'd be full of ... ( * shudder 's * ) swedes . 
   in the case of the winter war it was ... ** opposed to the finns being super-soldiers . 
  ** what kind of soviet-agent-finlandization propaganda is this ? 
  * bag him up , boys !, 
  * over the border he goes . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it 's lordi 's song that she favorites . 
  who could not love that one ? 
  i think you 're being overly aladeen . 
  iceland has gone a long way . 
  safer roads , i presume ? 
  of course you do n't need a military in times of peace . 
   lots of ore and draftees for ** realization of greater finland ** . 
  ftfy . 
  their ground forces are pretty easy to outnumber , though . 
  then it 's paskaa . 
  hmm ... naah , i think i prefer the alphabetical order . 
  denmark is named on the list !, 
  * before * you , in fact !, 
  you 're the last country mentioned !, 
  who 's sucking it now ? 
  i see no glags on mobiles . 
  still , i assume all redditors are amerifat neckbeards . 
  finland afraid of russia amerifat pls . 
  some other `` pick one `` s :  usa  slim pick one !, 
   sweden  heterosexual pick one !, 
   russia  not corrupt pick one !, 
  from the suggestion part :  `` i was gon na write delete racist comments but on second thought , do n't , just ban the users . 
  this way everyone can get a better view on how people think . '', 
  and right under it :  `` remove all kebabs . '', 
  hehe . 
  still , i do n't support immediately banning users for being racist . 
  that can easily backfire , since racism is an ambiguous term . 
  and many comments are sarcastically racist , how do we know which ones for sure ? 
  besides , freedom of speeech duuds . 
  americans come here to flood our polls , huh ? 
  damn imperialists . 
  i do n't see how that is relevant . 
  are you saying that / r/europe is actually populist while it 's accusing political leaders of being populist ? 
  because the lower part of your comment makes sense only if / r/europe is actually populist , since if it was n't he was just throwing bullshit around randomly accusing that / r/europe is populist . 
  as expected from / u/argiecunt , what a gentleman !,
