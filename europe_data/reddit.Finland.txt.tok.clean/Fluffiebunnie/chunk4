  farmers in many western eu countries are taking more resources and turning it to less resources . 
  their job simply is n't producing anything in terms of euros . 
  otherwise they would n't need these huge subsidies . 
  the only reason not to just import more food is because it might undermine national security . 
  in case of a war or some other event that cuts international trade , food prices will skyrocket and domestic farming will be profitable again . 
  it takes time to set up the farming from zero however , so some domestic farming might be desireable . 
  the problem exists because we keep paying subsidies to farmers who are not doing anything productive . 
  the domestic belgian farming sector is literally taking more resources and turning it to less resources ( in terms of euros ) . 
  there 's more than enough production elsewhere . 
  the only real need for all this domestic production is for national security reasons ( e.g. 
  something cuts international trade , such as a trade war ) . 
  well it isnt . 
  women 's rights , gay rights , drinking culture etc. 
  secular arabs will have very few issues though . 
  i 'm not taking a stance on whether it 's moral or not , just whether it is probable or not . 
  no but it 's a huge distinction here . 
  people are n't panicking over completely irrelevant shit like skin color . 
  islamic religion is often not very compatible with our western way of life . 
  well it 's certainly much more the latter than the former , yes . 
  if they were completely black christians or muslims , they would face racial discrimination too , however . 
  i think that post was tongue in cheek . 
  terrorist on terrorist violence . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right , but ... 
  but the problems do exist in cities where the concentration of immigrants is very high . 
  of course if you have a huge city you can allocate more immigrants there without as large issues . 
  they 'll be forced to integrate instead of isolate . 
  you got the analogy the wrong way . 
  immigration is the problem , the projects have simply escalated it . 
  just like fast food escalates obesity epidemics . 
  malm\u00f6 is full of iraqi immigrants . 
  they have n't integrated well . 
  seems to be working well in malm\u00f6, 
  if the refugees were christian , however , we would feel differently . 
  however that would be in part because the situation would truly * be different * . 
  actually it 's quite the opposite . 
  without the eu mifid ii/emir regulations london would be an even bigger player . 
  most of the users of the london derivatives market are n't eu institutions . 
  stop spamming this same copypasta, 
  london will continue to be the financial center of the world in the future . 
  they already have complete control of the derivatives market , which is by far the most important financial market . 
  no i did n't . 
  refugees are part of the broad group called immigrants . 
  i used the two terms because sentences become boring if you use the same words all the time . 
  they did n't have to go through hell though . 
  no one forced them to go all the way to germany . 
  the article is purposefully answering a red herring question . 
  no one gives a shit whether there 's more crime in the immediate vicinity of the refugee center . 
  the fact is that immigrants are overrepresented in crime statistics . 
  yle just found a clever way of downplaying this by changing the question a little . 
  that true/false thing is blatant propaganda , because it takes top myths and twists them a little . 
  two common complaints about refugees is that they ** cause crime ** and that accepting them is ** expensive ** . 
  instead of answering these questions honestly , they twist the question so that they can `` dispel the myth '' and give an answer that downplays the impact of immigrants . 
  first , they ask whether there 's an increase of crime in the * immediate vicinity * of the refugee center . 
  who cares ? 
  we care whether it increases overall crime in the area/city . 
  second , they ask whether it 's expensive * for the city * to maintain a refugee center ? 
  they say false , it 's not expensive because the state pays for it . 
  jesus fucking christ , who do they think funds the state ? 
  it 's the fucking taxpayers . 
  yes , even if they were with isis ( source : the head of asylum department for the finnish migration service ) . 
  instead they get permits to stay that last one year and then have to be renewed . 
  i guess the article had a typo . 
  they had to have meant 80 hour work weeks ( though the dane would exceptionally have a 50 hour work week ) . 
  no , they ca n't handle the * registration * of everyone * instantly * . 
  just like in everyone other country , including germany . 
  while waiting for registration they would be cared for with water , food , roof , medical checkups etc. 
  but instead the migrants threw away the food and water in protest . 
  they did n't want to wait . 
  they wanted to go forward . 
  they can appeal the decision and it can take years for the issue to be finalized . 
  sanders is a hardcore socialist and would fit well in the hard left parties ( not communist parties though ) . 
  we 're not hiring people here . 
  just like when providing welfare inside our country , we 're not giving it to the most successful people but to those who need it the most . 
  this is about humanitarian aid . 
  however it 's all being fucked up and as a result everyone suffers . 
  i never said there 's more leftists . 
  i 'm just saying if you 're going to crack down on `` extremism '' , you need to do it on the left too . 
  they did everything they could . 
  too many migrants for such a small country . 
  earlier they had let people pass , but then eu started whining about registration . 
  there was never any fear of violence . 
  the migrants caused the violence themselves but being impatient and storming the station and rioting . 
  but none of this matters . 
  what matters is that they were * always * headed for germany , not hungary . 
  that means they are economic migrants . 
  they were not satisfied with poor eu countries , they wanted germany . 
  for economic reasons . 
  the point here is that they were never going to stay in hungary . 
  hungary was n't rich enough . 
  they were going to go through hungary , to austria and finally to germany . 
  this is pure economic migration . 
  migrants come to hungary en route to germany 2 . 
  eu criticized hungary for not registering refugees , so hungary does n't let anyone leave without registering 3 . 
  migrants get angry because they want to move on , not wait to be registered . 
  migrants storm trains and train stations , and are then forcibly moved out of there . 
  riots start ( some hungarian hooligans try to bash some migrants but they 're quickly stopped ) . 
  some migrants are told they 'll be taken close to austria , but in reality they are transported to camps where they will be registered . 
  migrants riot again , escape from camps and start walking towards austria . 
  hungary gives in ( possibly eu gave them green light to halt registrations ) and starts bussing them to austrian border . 
  absolutely blatant pandering from the pm .
