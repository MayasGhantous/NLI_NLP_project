  apart from vegetarian cultures like in india , most people tend to eat more meat as they transition away from poverty . 
  of course after a certain point when buying meat is no longer a financial constraint , meat consumption stops increasing with wealth . 
  how strongly though ? 
  estonia is suffering a considerable brain drain to finland on top of the universal brain drain to large hubs like london and us of veryvery top people, 
  estonians have almost no issues integrating into finland . 
  they find work easily . 
  in fact , when they move here they generally already have employment in finland . 
  another way to view it is that estonians do not impose a social cost on finland , but rather the opposite . 
  germany predicted they would receiev 800,000 migrants this year alone . 
  obviously not all from syria . 
   switching to plant based foods that 's not going to happen . 
  as people get wealthier , people switch * from * plant based foods to meat . 
  fuck that shit . 
  they 're in a safe european country . 
  media manufacturing stories again . 
  seems like this angle of the situation generates most clicks ( or even worse , most journalists tend to be left wing and thus push an agenda ) . 
  ` rabbit of caerbannog ' was taken . 
  due to the gypsies no one can say they 're not a racist without lying . 
  i stood with bashar `` the lion '' al-assad from day one . 
  errrr hungary is being swamped by migrants moving through their country . 
  the immigration issue is not the only thing going on in europe , but it 's perhaps the biggest ` common ' issue across europe . 
  not surprising seeing a lot of these threads . 
   maybe a better solution would be incarceration until their countries are stable and deport them at the first opportunity ? 
  something like that . 
  no , it 's a completely ridiculous approach . 
  letting known terrorists roam the streets among other muslims is just asking for trouble . 
  there 's both the danger of conflicts erupting ans well as the potential for recruitment and spread of extremist ideology . 
  who cares if we 're inhumane to isis terrorists , especially when our `` inhumanity '' is simply sending them back to a problem they directly contributed to . 
  of course not , but they can not deport them either . 
  the head of the asylum department for the finnish immigration service [ had the following to say  ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.iltalehti.fi%2fuutiset%2f2015082020209462_uu.shtml&amp;edit-text= )  despite the acts of a person , we can not return him/her to an area where people are being tortured and shot . 
  people who have participated in terrorism or war crimes will be denied asylum , but they will be granted a temporary permit to stay , lasting one year at a time . 
  but they will not get deported as long as a war rages in their home country , even if they used to have ties with isis .

  the families receive the above figures * and * housing . 
  however housing does n't mean their own brand new large apartment , but dormitory style accommodation . 
  asylum seekers get free housing . 
  these houses are generally not normal apartments though ( less expensive ) . 
  on top of those figures they also get free housing . 
  just smear it with pig blood . 
  far more humane . 
  when rumors about it becoming more difficult to enter eu spread , fewer people will embark on the trip . 
  it 's a pretty simply incentive issue . 
  26 % are under 18 . 
  the majority are men http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_male_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applicants_in_the_eu-28 , _ by_age_group_and_status_of_minors , _ 2014 _ ( % 25 ) _ yb15_iii . png the above statistics does not include those who never apply for asylum because they know they 'll get deported ( that is , people who are n't from syria , iraq or libya ) . 
  these are likely to be economic refugees and mostly young male . 
  total worldwide refugees ? 
  because of those who reach eu are mostly young male according to 2014 eurostat http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics, 
   refugees in general do not have detailed knowledge of the intricacies of transfer payments in different european welfare states it 's mostly rumor based , though many countries have websites in arabic describing just how great their country and welfare system is , set up by the authorities responsible for processing and caring for the refugees/illegals . 
  these authorities greatly benefit from having their systems overburdened as it gives them access to higher budgets and the top management gets a bigger `` empire '' to control ( a typical corporate governance issue ) . 
  well i do n't see how that would be a bad policy to balance out the 78 % male refugee population . 
  especially if this was done in an organized manner by transporting those who are too weak/poor to make the illegal trip here and sending some people who entered illegally back . 
  does n't have to be just females , could be families . 
  right now our darwinistic and chaotic system is favoring those who are prone to break laws and take huge risks ( young males ) , which means we get the people who are most suited for surviving in the harsher conditions closer to syria etc. 
  essentially all refugees are on welfare here . 
  i mean what do you think is going to happen when you do n't speak any languages ? 
  of course not , they pay 1/10 of the welfare of a more northern country . 
  no , not really . 
  it takes years for alternative parties to become viable alternatives even though they are a better match for most people 's opinions than the establishment . 
  not to mention politicians are n't exactly known to keep their promises . 
  i do n't know about the strela , but the with the igla it 's incredibly easy to bring down a civilian airliner within tens of kilometres of landing/take-off . 
  we got to play with the simulators in the military , very easy to use . 
  because no one is ever again going to extend mortgages to people like that in spain . 
  and people are going to be hesitant to build low income housing if the government will just take it over . 
  the end result is that low income housing becomes more expensive . 
  the people who own the banks now are not the same people as before the crisis . 
  equity owners got wiped out during the bailouts ( the bailout was to rescue the creditors , whom have since been repaid ) . 
  the government can buy the houses from the banks if they want . 
  or build new ones . 
  so some private house owner is supposed to be on the hook for the poor people ? 
  they rent them out or develop the land for other use . 
  forcing these owners to let them live there for free would set a catastrophic precedent for the spanish real estate market that would hurt the poor the most in the long run . 
  if you think anyone should give them housing , it would be the government . 
  `` we should not give in to rightwing terrorism . 
  right wing terrorists want to stop the refugees . 
  by association stopping the refugees is giving in to terrorism . '', 
  that 's your thought process right ? 
  well it works both ways , given antifa wants to accept all refugees , and they 're left wing terrorists . 
  they do n't need to listen to the extremists , but to the people . 
  however they 're a symptom of something else . 
  take a bunch of seemingly normal people and push them enough , some of them will inevitably radicalize . 
  just like in the middle east ( except their `` normal '' is pretty radical for us too ) . 
  yeah the strong ones make it , the ones with the best chances of surviving out there . 
  and we leave all the weak who * actually need help * behind because they did n't have the strength or the lack of moral integrity to break laws . 
  we switch funding from the weak to give brand new apartments and shit to those who ignore our borders . 
  what kind of system are we perpetuating here ? 
  `` to get to safety in europe you have to rob your friends blind to fund criminal human traffickers , then you burn your papers , scuttle your boat in the mediterranean and hope for the coast guard to catch you '' . 
  and that 's just the start . 
  after that you rob and pillage to survive the illegal journey through europe to whatever welfare paradise you 've been convinced to try and reach . 
  we ca n't allow this sort of disorder . 
  there needs to be rule of law . 
  borders must be respected . 
  those who are most in need can be transported here from turkey etc if need be , such as families , elderly , children and women . 
  not if the russians get to her first , 
   everybody has the right to apply for asylum , according to the fundamentals of the german constitution . 
  no you 're supposed to apply in the first eu country you arrive to . 
   waah waah open your heart over 75 % of those who make it to europe are male 17-35 who probably should be fighting for their country and preparing to rebuild it instead of taking the easy way out . 
  the women and children are stuck in turkey and the war zones . 
  and now we 're shifting our resources from helping those there , to helping people who are willing to commit crimes ( illegal border crossings ) here . 
  furthermore , if any of these asylum applicants are found to be former isis members , we ca n't even deport them !, 
  it 's illegal to send ex-isis fighters back to a country in war .
