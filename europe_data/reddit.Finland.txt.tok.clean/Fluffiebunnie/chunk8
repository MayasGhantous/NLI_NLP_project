  why settle for peaceful macedonia when you can break a few more laws and get to prosperous germany ? 
  i get why they want to do it , but that does n't mean it 's right or that we should allow it . 
  true finns in finland have compromised ( although their rhetoric in the beginning was obviously against that ) now that they got into the government . 
  i do n't think it 's unreasonable to expect other similar populist parties to compromise . 
  true finns however is n't really far right . 
  it 's unfair to blame leftists . 
  * all * establishment parties deserve blame for completely ignoring the immigration question for years . 
  they left a huge vacuum . 
  the success of ukip , true finns , sweden democrats , fn etc has nothing to do with them getting money . 
  these are also not neoliberals . 
  the neoliberals ( which i tend to vote for due to economics reasons ) are generally not anti-immigration . 
  also it 's kind of disingenuous to claim that these parties are far-right anyway . 
  there 's only one significant far-right party in europe that i know of , and that 's golden dawn . 
  i think you 're exaggerating the far right problem . 
  the only place where it 's actually a serious issue is greece . 
  everywhere else they 're just a nuisance like the antifa , and very few in numbers . 
  i do n't know about your country , but the normal `` right wing '' in finland is not very socially conservative and are not homophobic . 
  the right wing here simply favors more ring wing economic policies ( and less welfare ) . 
  i think it 's important to distinguish nazis/far-right from just the right wing . 
   are full welfare benefits available to the residents of eu countries as soon as they arrive ? 
  and you ca n't show up and wait it out either ( you got to work in between ) . 
  they 'll deport you back to your original eu country after 3 months if you just show up in another with no way to support yourself . 
  [ from this eu brouchure on free movement  ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/citizenship/docs/guide_free_movement_low.pdf ) ** what if you want to stay for longer than three months ? 
  ** it depends on your status : your right to reside for more than three months is subject to certain conditions . 
  the nature of these conditions depends on your status in the host eu country . 
  ** workers , self-employed , providers of services ** workers and self-employed persons have the right to reside without any conditions other than being a worker or self-employed person . 
  the same right applies to persons who temporarily provide services in the host eu country.for details of transitional arrangements on free movement of workers , see chapter 12 below . 
  ** retention of worker or self-employed status ** eu citizens retain the status of workers and self-employed persons in the following circumstances : \u2022 if they are unable to work as the result of an illness or accident ; or \u2022 if they are in duly recorded involuntarily unemployment and have registered as jobseekers with the relevant employment office ; or \u2022 if they have embarked on vocational training . 
  ** students ** students must meet the following three conditions : \u2022 be enrolled at an establishment for the principal purpose of following a course of study or vocational training ; \u2022 have comprehensive sickness insurance cover there ; and \u2022 assure the relevant national authority , by means of a declaration or by such equivalent means as they may choose , that they have sufficient resources for themselves and their family not to become a burden on the host eu country 's social assistance system during their residence . 
  ** and other economically inactive persons ** other economically inactive persons ( e.g. 
  unemployed , retired , etc. ), 
  * must also have sufficient resources for themselves and their family * not to become a burden on the host eu country 's social assistance system during their residence and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover, 
  i do n't know how well it 's supervised , but if you had a job lined up for your or you were attending a university or similar , your employer/uni probably did everything for you . 
  a lot of the albanian migrants are sent back here , yes . 
  a lot of kurds in europe too . 
  it has definitely not been the highest worry for europe for over a decade . 
  in fact it did n't really become a huge issue until 2011 . 
  before that it was a minor issue with anti immigration parties having < 10 % support . 
  greece and italy are n't the first country except for a small amount of libyans . 
  most people who come to greece and italy go through turkey for example . 
  those who come from sub-saharan africa through libya to europe are n't even war refugees . 
   i know a fair number of europeans who have left their own struggling countries for greener pastures in primarily germany and the u.k. you 're not allowed to move to another eu country unless you can prove you have the funds to sustain yourself and your dependents ( either a job or enough money ) . 
  these people do n't move to other eu countries to leech of welfare . 
  [ source : chapter six ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/citizenship/docs/guide_free_movement_low.pdf ), 
  the point of asylum is that they go back where they come from once the war is over . 
  it makes sense that they stop in countries close to the conflict . 
  the people in europe are never going to go back , except maybe to join the next isis . 
  the vast majority of them are economic migrants , not war refugees . 
  they 're not really as big of victims as people make them out to be . 
  as has been stated time and time again , the very moment they move on from the first safe country they flee to , they cease to be war refugees . 
  that does n't mean one should use violence of course . 
  maybe protest . 
  apparently the encryption key is outdated anyway , so unless you find 2007 blue rays it 's useless . 
  yeah you do n't get arrested for publically talking about how x race is inferior . 
  you get ridiculed though . 
  there was a pretty funny case about our former prime minister 's ( matti vanhanen ) father who published works about differences in cranial shapes between races and its effect on intelligence and other pseudoscience about 10 years ago . 
  someone reported him but there was no law broken about him saying blacks have 20 iq points less than whites . 
  coincidentally i just googled him to see when exactly this took place , and it appears he died today . 
  well the full code is on wikipedia , so no one 's getting sued in my country at least . 
  5b is the missing part by the way . 
  latvia is n't * that bad * of a a country if you want to work . 
  but it 's not a country with high welfare handouts . 
  i thought maybe someone could explain why it 's interesting . 
  it seems to me that op is just trying to stir shit about refugees even though it was n't their fault . 
  and i 'm not some immigration apologist either . 
  yeah . 
  they 're also supposed to apply for asylum in the first safe country they arrive to . 
  now no one expects turkey to be able to house all of the syrian refugees alone . 
  but if everyone were law abiding people , things would be handled in an organized manner between turkey and other nations . 
  some refugees might get sent from turkey to europe . 
  more likely , these would be political refugees who could not safely return to their home country even after the war was over . 
  the rest would be in refugee camps in turkey and surrounding countries , with the economic burden taken care of by the international community . 
  once the war is over , the people have to go back . 
  but these people do n't have an intention of returning , even though many granted asylums are technically supposed to be temporary in nature . 
  i was n't really serious . 
  the latter option was semi-serious , it seems they 're doing it in australia . 
  is there some symbolism here that goes over my head ? 
  generally you work for that , not wait for others to hand it to you . 
  but i 'm sure the rumors of comfy life without effort in uk etc makes working in latvia seem like the less alluring option . 
  i mean , you 've already travelled illegal this far , why not a bit more ? 
  once they get to the first safe country but still keep moving , they 're no longer war refugees but economic migrants . 
  they want to play chicken ? 
  let them play chicken . 
  once rumor gets around ... or then just pay some north african country to take them all , and move them there once rescued . 
  i do n't really see why this is interesting . 
  so someone who is an wahabi muslim and isis member might be a fine lad and should n't be judged just because he is part of a group , as that would be racism ? 
  some cultures are inferior . 
  i probably myself belong to at least some cultures that are complete shit but i hopefully make up for it by also associating with more redeeming cultures . 
   my `` success in early life '' is dependent on others providing for me . 
  that 's my point , but the reason to they fought so hard to provide for your is because there 's a sense of unity , a common culture . 
  millions died for nationalism , and as a result finland is an independent nation . 
  now that does n't mean that outsiders should n't be allowed to join , though not on their own terms . 
  it also does n't mean that these people do not care about anyone but their own , though they care more about people who contribute and have contributed to their society than they do about outsiders . 
  you 're probably one of the first people at the airport trying to catch a flight to canada once even the slightest hint of a foreign oppressive force invading your country ( militarily ) . 
  nationalism might make no sense when it comes to a large culturally diverse nation with whom you have nothing in common with . 
  and one should also be critical about one selves nationalist bias when evaluating problems and avoid becoming blind to it . 
  however it 's different when it 's a small homogeneous nation where your success in early life literally is all thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of the previous generations to provide it for you . 
  in civilized western countries you do n't get arrested for reading literature , not for being racist on a general level . 
  just saying . 
  i agree with the rest of your post though .
