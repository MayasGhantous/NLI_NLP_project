`` do n't you dare militarize our potential military base and easy waypoint into finland and sweden ! '', 
  i 've always wondered since when agreements about dm status of \u00c5land have n't applied to russia since russian empire agreed to keep \u00c5land demilitarized in treaty of paris ( 1856 ) ... 
  well defending finland is almost as defending sweden since finland has been sweden 's `` shield '' against russian aggression since forever . 
  are finns and romanians secretly soul mates ( when it comes to relations with russia ) ?!, 
  we 've a 2 common sayings about russians in finland : 1 ) 1 finn represents 10 ruskies 2 ) ruskie is always a ruskie even if fried in butter ( sounds better in finnish than when translated ), 
  hesburger in finland is like `` premium '' burger place , quality/price-ratio is way higher than in mcdonald 's . 
  you get to spam cheeseburgers in mcdonald 's due to their 1 $ cheeseburger in the menu . 
  usually a double beef burger ( direct translation from finnish would be `` 2-layer hamburger '' . 
  in your menu it 's simply called `` hesburger '' ) is enough for me but sometimes the megaburger has to save the day !, 
  neste ? 
  you should 've guessed from the rye burgers in the menu ... ( or does lithuanian hesburger even have those ? ), 
  i noticed that cut in the yle areena version . 
  first i thought my audio derped but i guess even our own president gets censored from leftist state funded media nowadays . 
  those cheeky bastards . 
  old saying ( atleast in finland ) goes that there 'll be 2 black christmases in every decade , although global warming is going to increase that number . 
  that 's the best objectivity !, 
  and at the same time they told denmark to register the refugees , not just let them travel through them from germany to sweden . 
  they 're huge hypocrites . 
  this is a normal saying in finland , or at least it was . 
  we are known for our negativity and i think many believe nowadays that the saying is outdated . 
  til that we finns have used almost exact finnish translation for netherlands/nederlanden this whole time ; nederlanden = alankomaat ( alanko = lowland , maat = lands ) . 
  sometimes though , when we casually talk about netherlands we use the incorrect name hollanti ( holland ) because alankomaat is a mouthfull to say in finnish . 
  this is blasphemy , clearly eesti can not into nordic !, 
  if saudi prince can get away with raping women in u.s , a finnish diplomat can get away with `` counterkidnapping '', 
  this whole russian propaganda against finland with the `` child kidnapping '' stories started in 2008 with a real kidnapping story . 
  anton salonen , then a 4 year old boy ( 10/03 ) , was taken to russia by his bicitizenship ( origin : russian ) mother in march 2008 without his father , finnish paavo salonen knowing about it . 
  mother had told paavo that two of them were just going to visit russia . 
  after paavo had wondered were two of them had gone , case was made public by finnish media in summer of 2008 . 
  after that came a long battle for parenthood of anton . 
  after a long courtbattle , finnish court made paavo a single parent of anton . 
  when all of this was going on , anton was still in russia and paavo decided to get him back with finnish diplomat . 
  in may of 2009 , they transported anton back to finland inside a diplomat car 's trunk . 
  well of course russia was outraged when they found out and gave a note to finland about it . 
  in the end , paavo kept anton and mother got 1,5 year probation and 20 000 $ fine for kidnapping . 
  and guess who was mother 's press manager ? 
  the infamous ** johan b\u00e4ckman ** , finnish anti-finland/pro-russia propagandist ... 
  this case started russia 's anti-finland propaganda ft. b\u00e4ckman and has been ongoing since ** 2009 ** . 
  `` oh demon finns kidnapping children and putting russian children to orphanages ! '', 
  remember kappa or / s otherwise you 're crazy . 
  ( sorry for being 2 days late ) there 's a joke in finland about sweden using us as her shield ( that idea was born because of winter war and sweden using large amounts of finnish soldiers when finland was eastern sweden ) : sweden will fight to the last finn :d, 
  how much does the centre party 's support come from the russian estonians ? 
  if they 've been leaning towards russia in the past , i 'd imagine a lot of their support comes from large russian minority in the eastern estonia . 
  is that really an argument in estonia ? 
  estonians should remember that your population is +1.3 million whereas finland has +5.5 million people . 
  your entire population would almost fit inside of our capital region ( and completely fit inside of greater helsinki ) . 
  here in finland , when talking about taxation , we always complain about our own country and ask ourselves why we do n't have as low taxes as estonia and encourage our entrepreneurs as much . 
  maybe it 's just the way we finno-ugric tribes vent our frustration :d, 
  in my town local driving school decided to brand their cars with pokemon go ( like `` got ta catch them all '' slogan ) at the height of its popularity . 
  it 's pretty cringey seeing it now in the streets when pokemon go is pretty much dead in finland . 
  who wants to play this game at winter ? 
  baltic states are not member states of nordic council , only observers states . 
   `` nordic states ''  baltic states also in the picture oh eesti , we love you but no , you ca n't into nordic . 
  their headline makes an avarage joe , who only reads headlines , think that this was made up by some tabloid . 
  wow , independent likes you to think with their title that this news was created by a finnish clickbait tabloid instead of our national sis ( finnish security intelligence service , suojelupoliisi ) . 
  is their goal to discredit this news ? 
  happens to a lot of places which russia conquers . 
  yeah stereotypes are sometimes true : a self-hating swede appeared . 
  yeah , i 've only eaten it a little bit at christmas since it 's traditional christmas food . 
  also , i do n't think it 's even estonian either . 
  i think it 's originally swedish , since it 's been around in finland since the 1700s . 
  reading these comments , i do n't think huffpost researched any of the smaller countries . 
  i was n't gon na reply to you because i was tired and after night i completely forgot this thread ( + this is already almost a week old thread ) but because i noticed your last comment here talking smack about me based on your ignorance , here goes . 
  fines are supposed to punish the offender , they 're not supposed to be used for balancing the budget . 
  and that 's also against finnish constitution . 
   maybe because we were the ones to take it to its full conclusion . . russians were also the ones to do it but they did n't learn . 
  now the pendulum has swung from stalinism to putinism . 
  it 's quite sad that the most important elections for a citizen has the 2nd lowest voter turnout ( 2012 it was 58,2 % , eu elections had 40,9 % ) . 
  municipal/city councils ' decisions have more effect on the life of an average citizen than the finnish parliament/government decisions . 
  my first time too . 
  i hope the young voter turnout will rise , the last time it was abysmal 30 % . 
  fyi it 'd be worth over ~ ~ 37 billion euros ( ~ 34 after brexit ) ~ ~ 17 billion euros . 
  ** edit : ** accidentally took all of europe 's population into account . 
  for some reason it has been much easier for me to learn german thanks to my english skills rather than my swedish skills although finnish national agency for education would say otherwise . 
  oh the good old `` learning swedish helps you to learn other languages '' ^ ^ even ^ ^ though ^ ^ we ^ ^ start ^ ^ learning ^ ^ english ^ ^ at ^ ^ younger ^ ^ age ^ ^ than ^ ^ swedish lie . 
  what ?!, 
  we have a bar in a tram in helsinki ? 
  [ obligatory . 
  apparently 1918 was the year when germany was very generous about giving their princes as presents to other countries in form of kingships , e.g. 
  [ finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_frederick_charles_of_hesse ) and lithuania . 
  as a finn i agree . 
  someone must have slept during history classes about sweden before 1809 . 
  swedish was the only official language in finnish area and if you did n't speak it , you could n't work in government and you were regarded as a dumb peasent in higher social circles . 
  see the problem ? 
  finnish became the official language of finland long after sweden had lost it 's control over finland . 
  you swedes still believe your propaganda that every non-swede was equal to a swede in glorious swedish empire but that was n't the case . 
  systembolaget is worried about haaparanta/haparanda and sweden-finland ferries . 
  their revenue from 5,5 % beers would disappear when swedes ( who live close to finland ) would shop in finland . 
  someone must 've slept through the civics class ( or greek education system is too poor to have one ) . 
  parties from both left and right can be populist . 
  when earth is dying and we 're moving out ( hopefully ) , we should let them rule , as a joke . 
  finland 's last government . 
  they 'd more likely come from ~ ~ finnish communist party ~ ~ left alliance . 
  inb4 paula v\u00e4yrynen becomes leader of centre party . 
  there 'll always be nostalgia wave for certain decade . 
  i wonder what we 'll be nostalgic for in 10 years . 
   techno , electro etc. 
  djs  in the 80s lol , both made their breakthroughs in the late 90s/early 00s and darude is still around . 
  i think that if many of their middle class voters , who moved in from sdp ( social democratic party ) , move back to there after the party moves further right , it 'll come `` lilliputti '' aka small party again and it 'll be in the same size as kd ( christian democrats ) . 
  sorry but if you think they would use nukes against us , you 're a moron . 
  their former capital and 2nd largest city is right next to us and nuclear fallout would kill millions of their own .
