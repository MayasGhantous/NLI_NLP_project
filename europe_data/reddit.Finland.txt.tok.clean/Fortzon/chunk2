  putin is n't stalin on mental health level . 
  we 're more pro-eu army than pro-nato . 
   but sweden is ? 
  seems a little far fetched . 
  nobody is saying that . 
  i 'm talking from finnish pov but i believe swedes also know that they would n't last a month ( max 2 weeks ) if russia decided to attack . 
  the point of finnish defence forces ( and swedish in the future if they decide to give more funding to their military ) is to be a deterrent so russia does n't even consider attacking us . 
  that 's also misleading picture because it 's trying to send opposite message with more green shades than red/yellow shades . 
  conclusion : both picture colorists have bias . 
  well at least be a bit positive that at least your gay relationships are recognized ( like in finland up until now ) . 
  it 'd be a bit awkard if you had eastern european-like laws . 
  well he 's against it when he 's speaking to evangelist groups . 
  imo he does n't care personally . 
  our pm juha sipil\u00e4 , a conservative laestadianist , when asked about if he would repeal the gay marriage law he said although he opposes it , it 's a settled deal and he would n't do anything to it . 
  it 'd be quite funny if some non-finns/estonians would actually try to use these phrases :d, 
  there should be also some link between finnish and german as well . 
  finnish has links to german since we have words that are [ proto-germanic like kuningas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-germanic_language#loans_into_non-germanic_languages ) ( it derives from `` kuningaz '' from where also the words king , kung and k\u00f6nig developed ) . 
  and lot of loan words , especially in military , like j\u00e4ger = j\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri and panzer = panssari . 
  finnish also has links to german language since we have words that are [ proto-germanic like kuningas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-germanic_language#loans_into_non-germanic_languages ) ( it derives from `` kuningaz '' from where also the words king , kung and k\u00f6nig developed ) . 
  and lot of loan words , especially in military , like j\u00e4ger = j\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri and panzer = panssari . 
  maybe there 's a threshold only to include larger languages ? 
  soviets purged ( to some extent ) and oppressed pretty much all finno-ugric tribes ( except estonians ofc ) in russia after ww2 e.g. 
  [ ingrians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingrian_finns#ingrians_in_the_soviet_union ) and [ vepsians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vepsians#historical_period ) . 
  tl : dr ; swedes are morons who ca n't into proper statistics . 
  lutefisk/lutfisk/lipe \u00e4kala is n't even bad , try a pizza with surstr\u00f6mming . 
  of course , finns remember . 
  we got comics and when i was a kid bamse was always on tv as a tourism company ( finnmatkat , nowadays tui finland which is part of tui nordic/group ) mascot . 
  it 's funny how many european classic children cartoons are in fact anime . 
  yeah and even [ tove jansson 's sketches of groke ] ( http://muumittaja.blogspot.fi/2013/04/morko.html ) ( link is in finnish but there are several pictures from jansson 's books ) are less scary than the anime version . 
  japanese know what they 're doing . 
  sometimes it was good for finland to be neutral in cold war era because that meant we got best cartoons from both worlds :d, 
  this was really good as a kid before school started . 
  i watched all the `` once upon a time ... '' series as a kid from vhs . 
  i was introduced to asterix through cartoon films as a child and i 've only read one comic book but i 'm 19 and i can say that many of my age have at least heard of asterix and most of it is thanks to the cartoon films . 
  i do n't know about modern kids thought but i guess it 's same to them since the cartoon films are still being shown in tv from time to time and the newest film is just 3 years old . 
  of course it was us and uk 's fault that iranian democracy fell , shah was their guy . 
  but was it their fault that iran fell under the rule of khomeini ? 
  nobody in the west forced iranians to turn into a theocracy , it was their own choice ( although women protested a lot ofc . ) . 
  they could 've easily made a democratic revolution like many countries have made after protesting an autocrat . 
  but they did n't , they chose a religious ruler over a democratic one . 
  try to get a peak higher than 1km and then we might talk . 
  hills like suur munam\u00e4gi do n't count . 
  well she 'd be correct if we lived in times when portugal was a vassal . 
  do n't blame us , blame your government . 
  in their greed they think they can squeeze more tax euros from us but haha , we go to latvia !, 
  ... you 'd have a handful of congolese hands full of blood diamonds . 
  do n't worry , [ suur-suomi ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_3b3yjsw2hsi/tqognhbfugi/aaaaaaaaamu/na4xzzo-9ps/s1600/11%2bsuur-suomi.gif ) will take care of that problem . 
  we welcome all . 
  more like `` estonians invented sauna '' they even legit tried it and [ succeeded ] ( http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/rl/smoke-sauna-tradition-in-voromaa-00951 ) , those eesti bastards !, 
  traitor , to the gulags you go . 
  siberia will teach , as the saying goes . 
  it 'd have been better if they showed austria for , you know , historical reasons . 
  the consensus is that finns are not angry at the swedes , finns are angry at sweden . 
  there were thousands of swedish ** volunteers ** in finland but the government of sweden never officially sent anyone ( too scared maybe ? 
  ) , only moral support just like the rest of the west . 
   they had a referendum in 2014 they voted to remain in the uk . 
  i 'm tired of seeing this argument so many times . 
  scotland voted for eu member uk , not for brexit uk . 
  we already had [ spurdo sp\u00e4rde ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spurdo-sparde ), 
  it maybe because of svenskj\u00e4vlar are pretty slow in learning these viral things that they have n't made their own video yet so we ca n't mock them sadly . 
  says a guy whose country 's politicians used eu as a scapegoat for their fuck ups and future schemes multiple times . 
  and who would ban them ? 
  other sc permanent members would veto the ban ( uk vetoes usa 's and china russia 's ) . 
  the whole unsc veto system was designed in favor of permanent members . 
  so you thought sweden has n't been selling weapons to saudi arabia in 21st century ? 
  [ cute , read the second paragraph . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/12/sweden-stopped-selling-arms-to-saudi-arabia ), 
  we 're talking about countries who have sold weapons to saudi arabia here , not who continues to sell them . 
   rich countries  finland yeah , maybe in 2012 but this is 2017 . 
  our economy has been in a recession since euro crisis and we even earned [ `` sick man of europe '' title . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sick_man_of_europe#post-world_war_i_usage ) giving free money to greece did n't help either . 
  so no money from us . 
  those stimulus packages to greece were enough . 
  then we invade northern sweden ( maybe only finnish speaking areas ) to create buffer zone ( our land forces are superior to sweden 's ) then we prepare for war with russia :d mini version of ww1 german plans all over again . 
  yeah , freedom is subjective . 
  i do n't think finland should be in shared 1st place either ( or this is just general finnish pessimism ) but at least in top 10 . 
  haha at least we 're straightforward with you / u/jonstiniho89, 
  well , time to get karelia back . 
  okay , fine . 
  my point still stands . 
  social democrats are about people and their rights , not about corporations . 
  for finnish people : * are we poorer than other nordic countries ? 
  check . 
  * are we richer than estonia and russia ? 
  check ( not hard though ) all is right , as expected . 
  social democrats are usually about people and their rights . 
  ftas like ttip and ceta are about corporations and their profits . 
  ceta would be okay if it did n't include same anti-democratic shit like ttip did aka corporations can sue governments in international tribunal which is controlled by them . 
  and it 's understandable . 
  many people were born on those ceded territories and they/their family almost lived their entire lives there . 
  it 's not their fault that they had to move out so they 're bitter about it . 
  elder germans must feel the same way about east prussia and we feel the same way about karelia ( although both us did n't gain anything ) . 
  iirc putin wanted to split ukraine with poland in 2015 ( or they were just crazy rumours ) . 
  that would 've been a good chance for you to recreate pre-ww2 borders with germany . 
  and after russia might fall into civil war , finland retakes karelia and petsamo   ^ ( pls russkies do n't hate , this is hypothetical ), 
  [ with every world war they move more west , be prepared germany . 
  no but nowhere did / u/mindalero imply that it was either . 
  turkey vs russia : russia turkey vs usa : turkey, 
  snarky comments aside , i , geographically unbiased finn , can vouch for the greek . 
  turkey , or mainly the sultan erdogan , is a threat .
