  it 's quite remarkable for finland to be on that list . 
  we were only 33 year old country in 1950 . 
  what can you expect from a member of neo-ottoman party whose leader is control freak sultan erdogan ? 
  inb4 norwegian newspaper makes an article about your comment . 
  most of the finns in sweden went to sweden after jobs ( like volvo and saab ) in the early 60 's to late 70 's . 
  they 'll die off in couple of decades , after that sweden 's most common foreign group will be [ iraqis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_sweden#immigration ), 
  surprised to find a jojo reference from / r/worldnews . 
  couple years ago we had a well known case of immigrant gang rape in finland and only thing that far-leftists said to criticism was `` finns rape more ! '' . 
  the argument was so funny because if you look at statistics the correct way aka proportionally , 5 % group commits 20 + % of crimes and the only conclusion they come up with is that `` finns rape more '' . 
  every extremist group ( left or right ) wants to twist the statistics to fit their narrative . 
  typical federalist . 
  he knows federation 's not going to happen so he 's angry about it in the internet . 
   new article about verhofstadt calling for more federalised europe . 
  and the water is wet . 
  wow this guy is dense mf . 
   every ** major ** european country, 
  imo the most effective way for the us to get every major european country ( e.g. 
  germany and france ) past the 2 % threshold would be the `` if your defence budget is n't at least 2 % of your gdp in x years , we 'll leave nato '' threat . 
  and i would n't imagine this being far from the truth when trump is in office and if he does n't listen to mad dog . 
  i lasted 5 seconds before i had to close the video . 
  who thought this video was a good idea ? 
  although trump 's other policies are bad , killing tpp might be the only one even [ liberals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlumcdbf4p4&amp;t=302s ) agree with and celebrate . 
  i hope ttip shares the same fate with tpp . 
   you do n't have euro not sure if sarcasm or just idiot . 
  read my other reply to another `` that 's how hitler came to power '' guy . 
  in finland we had a 6 party coalition ( so called rainbow government because it had parties , major and minor , from all over the spectrum ) 2011-2015 and it has been said to be partly the reason why we recovered so slowly ( slower than rest of eu ) from euro crisis . 
  coalition governments built on consensus are usually good but too many parties , major and minor , in the gov just puts progress to a halt . 
  i meant that let the populist party in as a secondary party , not as a pm party . 
  finns party ( 2nd largest 2015 ) leader timo soini chose to be our foreign minister ( traditionally 2nd largest party leader is our finance minister , soini probably did n't pick the position because he knew he would get harsh criticism for saving/austerity measures ) . 
  coalition government in which nazi party was , was led by them so ofc they could seize all the power . 
  and most of european countries with multi-party system are also parliamentary republics = in practice , pm is the head of the state and not president/chancellor like in weimar republic/modern germany . 
  hindenburg could be easily manipulated because he was old when hitler became chancellor . 
  populism is easy to combat . 
  other european countries should take our route and let them into coalition government . 
  in there they have to do something instead of whining and then they 'll be exposed to the public as turncoats . 
  example from finland ; finns party . 
  right wing ( not far ) populist party which gained massive amounts of support in 2011 when they ran as anti-eu party . 
  they did n't enter the government and went to opposition for 4 years to bark at the then current government . 
  then comes 2015 elections . 
  they got so much support that they were 2nd largest party in elections . 
  they entered the 3 party coalition government aaand they dropped their most popular issues in which finns voted for them ; immigration and refugee crisis . 
  their popularity has since dropped dramastically once people realised they were turncoats . 
  west metro has been a small eternity project in finland . 
  it has taken so long ( 7 years ) to complete that it has become the butt of a joke . 
  one of the jokes is `` let 's make bet which completes first ; west metro or olkiluoto-3 nuclear power plant '' . 
  olkiluoto 3 reactor has taken even [ longer to complete ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3 ) , 12 years and it was first supposed to open in 2010 . 
  what are estonians ' opinions of dj ilves ? 
  just asking as a finn . 
  let 's be honest , you may beat us in economics but you 'll never beat us in motorsports . 
  we 're a f1 & wrc driver factory for such a small country . 
  this year marks the 10th anniversary of ferrari not winning the championship . 
  last time kimi won it . 
  holy shit . 
  yeah i wonder why that was left out since after worries for grexit many articles were talking about fixit . 
  `` sweden will fight to the last finn ! '', 
  as the saying goes , 
  grandpa , you forgot to take your pills . 
   fundamentalist engineers sipil\u00e4 i assume ? 
  6.12.2017 : the title `` capital of finland '' will return to its rightful owner , turku . 
   true finns well at least we figured out where you live , satakuntalainen ( if not modern borders , at least in the historical province ) . 
  prepare to get assimilated by proper finland yet again when the government in the future decides to cut down number of provinces again . 
  does finnish alcohol tourism affect estonia 's budget ? 
  do you think your budget will drop when finns switch to latvia when you raise prices of alcohol to nearly finland 's level ? 
  idk about fake news made by russia nowadays but they were definitely a thing in finland back in late-00s . 
  they published multiple stories about our authorities illegally taking russian children to custody from their parents ; they tried to paint finland as child-kidnapping country after [ the so-called anton incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_salonen_incident ) , so russians ( and finnish russians ) would become more anti-finland and would n't come here to give us that sweet tourism money . 
  some russians believed those stories for a while but ultimately their mission failed . 
  russian media even had a finnish `` academic '' [ johan b\u00e4ckman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b%c3%a4ckman ) as their voice in finnish and russian tv criticizing finland . 
  he also was a finnish `` expert '' in russian tv about crimea annexation . 
  fortunately our houses are n't built like british homes or you would be dead from hypothermia . 
  [ time to build russian snowmen again !, 
  they were mostly ukrainians and other southerners . 
  got to be that malnourishment because in the 90s finns were dying from left and right due to rope `` malfunctions '' caused by poor quality rope made in recession years . 
  yesterday morning was -8 c and today it was -18 c ; in southern finland ( proper ) . 
  surprised me a bit . 
  it was horrible walking to the car with wind blowing so much . 
  if le pen is somehow traced back to bonaparte , then i 'd be worried . 
  well we also have a non-pc word for gypsies called manne and tbh that way it 'd be pretty easy to tell if the person is talking about gypsies or romanians . 
  idk why but in many languages words for gypsies and romanians are pretty close to each other so many mix them up . 
  for example , in finnish : country : romania romanian : romania-lainen gypsy : romani, 
  this `` fucking anti-semite '' is like a jewish version of godwin 's law :d it 's a well known historical fact that , at first , nazis planned to expel the jews from germany , [ e.g. 
  madagascar plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) . 
  at some point it was deemed too costly so they lit up the ovens . 
  as / u/gustaveiebon said , even bibi has said this . 
  french guiana * is * part of france and therefore eu , but it 's ** not ** part of ** geographical ** europe . 
  you make fun of americans and their knowledge of geography and then you spew that kind of bs . 
  you swedes decided to celebrate an italian saint and then brought it to finland . 
  end of story . 
   fenno-swedish lucia ftfy, 
  more surprising is that denmark was first of the nordics who had some sort of same-sex registered partnership but was one of the last ones to change it to same-sex marriage . 
  / u/a _ big_ass 's opinion is based on eugenics , not nazism . 
  eugenics was also ** part ** of nazism but not vice versa since eugenics was present long before nazism and nazism has more into it than just eugenics . 
  19th century american eugenics researchers are n't nazis . 
  i know what the difference between millionaire and billionaire is . 
  there are exactly 6 of them in finland : * herlin siblings ( antti , ilkka , niklas , ilona ) , * antti aarnio-wihuri * and heikki ky\u00f6stil\u00e4 , which / u/korplax already mentioned . 
  point of my comment was that finland is not 100 % full of billionaires which inherited their wealth . 
  since ky\u00f6stil\u00e4 is the only one who is self made that means that the real number is ~ 83 % . 
  yeah , i wondered why the map shows finland having ** only ** billionaires who were born with the silver spoon in their mouths . 
  yeah , there are many who only inherited the billions but like in every other country , there 's also self made billionaires here . 
  that 's why i wondered why we were in 6th place :o, 
  you 've always come ** a little bit ** arrogant ( probably because of your former super power status ) , like : `` pfft , those mainlanders , they do n't deserve us !,
