  `` rule britannia !,

  and you were exempt from a lot of things in eu , e.g. 
  did n't have to pay when other eu countries had to pay up . 
  but i still like you brits and your british / ( dark ? ), 
  finland is 6th ? 
  was the quality measured in major cities ? 
  after you go outside of major cities in southern and middle finland , the roads start to have a lot of pot holes . 
  that 's why , if we complain about our roads , we say `` but hey , at least we 're not russia '' . 
  sipil\u00e4 was n't bitching at the press . 
  the clickbaity articles are referring to his personal blog which was emotional because , in his words , the media dragged his family into this . 
  his emails to yle were about him being concerned that he was n't given enough time ( only 1,5 h ) to give comment to yle article before it was released and it was p.s : not his voter nor voter of his party , but i 'm annoyed that he 's now painted like some far-right leader trying to censor media . 
  he 's , at most , in centre-right . 
  you thought that romanians were vampires but it was us , the finns !, 
   mistakes happen , only when it is a * russian incident * it 's more serious . 
  ftfy according to our media . 
  sadly , i think it 's about abolishing conscription . 
  you know , because no woman ^ ^ and ^ ^ man should face the cruelty of conscription . 
  equality ... 
  those videos lay out other reasons besides `` left caused this '' . 
  they 're from a liberal with ba in political science and he has far larger understanding of politics than you and i have . 
  but please , stay ignorant and keep yelling yourself `` lalalalala i 'm not listening '' . 
  okay , if you do n't want to listen to a video , which tries to explain this situation so clearly that even the dumbest people can understand , here 's a more in-depth analysis on [ why clinton lost ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i67irm6ijms ) and [ why trump won . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjzmfyu04ao ), 
  wow , labeling people because they decide to play devil 's advocate . 
  how mature of you . 
  [ if you were an american , you 'd be part of the reason why trump won ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glg9g7bcjks ), 
  thanks russia . 
  it 's time to send the tanks boys , now both latvia and liethuania have become as delusional as estonia . 
  baltics ca n't into nordic !, 
   eastern europeans tend to see baltic countries as ... baltic countries . 
  it 's not even exactly associated with europe !, 
  look up who made the picture , 
  every map has some kind of bias . 
   made by estonian ofc baltics are in the north , 
  you apparently also used / r/finland instead of / r/suomi, 
  most of finno swedes are historically ethnic swedes since finland was part of sweden for over 600 years . 
  but in 600 years there have been plenty of opportunities for finns to marry into swedish families . 
  do n't worry , people who want independence/join sweden are in minority on that island . 
  imo if you 're going to make language map where you show mixed colors of two languages e.g. 
  in eastern europe ( like estonia with estonian and russian ) , you should also color northern norway and sweden mixed because of me\u00e4nkieli and sami . 
  and it 's always funny to see entire finnish ( west and south ) coast colored differently than other parts of finland to represent finno-swedes even though finnish speakers outnumber them in those areas as well ( except \u00c5land ofc ) . 
   i mix green tea and black coffee together wtf ?!, 
   also i eat the green tea leaves .

  napoleon had his horse , macron has his ds ^ ( ^ ** cough ** ^ citroen ^ ** cough ** ), 
  fun fact : according to finnish wikipedia , the 30 metre long peak at the top of the tower can be lowered inside the church and this feature was used in the winter and continuation war so the church would n't be so clear target to soviet bombers . 
   american although we do n't know which country 's citizen made it first , you know that kekistan meme got a lot traction when sargon , a british youtuber started using it as well and tried to register it as a ethnicity in uk ( since uk ethnicity laws are apparently really vague ) ? 
  imo kekistan meme has been run to the ground but just because it originated from 4chan does n't make it american meme . 
  and if you look at his posts , it 's clear that / u/crusader _ of_kekistan is n't from usa . 
  in ukraine they used green men . 
  here , they 'll use bears !, 
  the biggest question is ... what about the animu and animu games ? 
  i 'll have you know that we have the best [ puukkos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puukko ) !, 
  in most of europe , witches were stereotypically mostly women but in finland , 70 % of `` witches '' who were prosecuted were men . 
  there were total of 453 witch trials in finland and 50 % of witch trials ended on acquittal . 
  witches got a death sentence only if their witchcraft had allegedly killed someone . 
  op is pro-trump russian , did you really expect anti-trump post from him ? 
  til that polish and finnish share at least one word :d, 
   it did n't help that people did n't know a lot about electricity either . 
  ( only 15 % of the households had electricity back then ) this might be the biggest reason why `` the death wire '' killed so many . 
  people probably thought that it was just a normal fence . 
  and pawns have their own pawns , right eesti boy ? 
  you fucked it up . 
  well some people want to tweet about them partying and [ baltic sea cruiseferries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_sea_cruiseferries ) are popular party spots for young finns , swedes , estonians etc. 
  i agree with you but should n't the more accurate title for your listing be `` oh , and britain and france have lead fuckups the world over '' because only 2 of the events you listed were directly france 's fuckups and others were more or less your fuckups too . 
  this will create more anti-eu sentiment across europe . 
  germany invited them in and now that germany has had enough of them and have recruited the few skilled refugees among thousands of unskilled refugees , they want to force them into other countries ? 
  what a joke . 
  i was only talking about main parties , youth wings say crazy things to get publicity , like ncp 's youth wing . 
  i agree , i do n't like that halla-aho chose huhtasaari and especially hakkarainen into his team . 
  fyi i did n't brand the whole ncp as anti-gay party , i just said that some of their mps voted against equal marriage bill . 
  ~ 36,4 % of ncp mps voted against equal marriage bill at the time ( i do n't know how many retained their seat in the 2015 election ) [ ^ ( 1 ( finnish tabloid article ) ^ ) ] ( http://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000841827.html ) . 
  ncp was our mainstream right wing party before finns party so ofc there are some anti-gay ncp politicians and voters among libertarians . 
  we have a saying in finland : centre party betrays always ( sounds a lot better in finnish ) . 
  it 's funny to see how sipil\u00e4 rather wants to destroy the government rather than keep his government 's promises . 
  halla-aho said that the current government promises on tougher immigration were enough for him but this decision by sipil\u00e4 just revealed to all finns that centre and ncp were never going to keep their promises anyway . 
  and before foreigners come screaming at me about me being right-winger ; i 've never voted for finns party , i 'm little bit left of the centre but i 'm a social democrat because i ca n't stand sipil\u00e4 and current centre party . 
  also many finn party voters are former sdp ( social democratic party ) voters . 
  ** edit : ** fyi only real possibilities for centre and ncp now are kd and rkp aka christian democrats and swedish people 's party ( to fill finns party 's spot in the coalition ) . 
  if you thought we averted even more right-wing government than before , wait before we have party full of homophobes ( kd/cd ) back in the government . 
  our pm sipil\u00e4 is [ a laestadian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laestadianism ) . 
  he respected the gay marriage vote which was held during goverment before his but if he gets cd into the coalition with him i 've no shadow of a doubt that there 's going to be a second gay marriage vote . 
  there also some anti-gay mps in ncp as well so it 's a real possibility that anti-gay marriage bill would go through if they vote in the parliament instead of having a referendum about it . 
   try to vote convicted racists into power i do n't support halla-aho but his `` conviction '' was bullshit . 
  he was convicted for blasphemy for criticizing islam so there 's that , not a real conviction , just political man-hunt . 
  you 're correct if you 're only using motorways in these maps but if you included highways for other countries , then these roads should be included as well for finland . 
  problem is with the language as well since motorway only means moottoritie in finnish ( direct translation is motor road ) but highway can mean moottoritie ** and ** valtatie ( roughly translates to main road ) . 
  finland beats the netherlands again !, 
   today  basshunter - dota was released in 2006 , 11 years ago remember to not get a mortgage loan , otherwise you 're going get fucked in 2 years . 
  you were too busy having a siesta to notice that deutsche bank was robbing you , 
  when nordic netflix already has a very small catalogue ( e.g. 
  only a season or two of the very popular tv series/only first movie and no sequels ) and they pull this shit ... 
  i ca n't believe we have 1,3-2 times more fat people than the other nordics . 
  i guess that everyone else in the nordic countries self-reporting data might skew the results a little bit . 
  booze rally but for electricity !, 
  your nationalists might be friendly towards russia because russia has n't been a direct threat to sweden since the napoleonic wars . 
  our nationalists are n't as foolish as yours are because part of our national identity is defending our independence against the soviets in ww2 .
