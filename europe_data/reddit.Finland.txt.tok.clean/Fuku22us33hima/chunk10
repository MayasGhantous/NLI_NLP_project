  death toll is over 1.000 . 
  ukraine has lost already crimea . 
  this is just exactly what modern day `` war scenarios '' look like , they are `` grey '' , not as `` black and white '' situations like in the old days when countries declared wars against each others and mobilized all they got ( actually ukraine is pretty much forced to do so ) . 
  but do n't be mistaken , russia is the aggressor , of course . 
  it is using clever propaganda and media to blur the picture . 
   it was in ** no ** way influenced by us civil war . 
  and how do you know ? 
  i 'm sure those who did that flag , did a google search also ? 
  [ because this is the result . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?source=lnms&amp;q=confederate%20flag&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=pjhgu9b-cihxyqox_okiaq&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaa&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=603 ) ( all results are confederate flag ) co-incidence ? 
  just like so many before ... ? 
  good move germany . 
  more this from other eu members . 
  and thank you !, 
  we have quit the habit of drinking our enemies blood nowadays when we 've heard about aids and ebola . 
  actually the warm blood steams at winter when you let in drain to the snow ... just like breath . 
  i think it 's clever propaganda to get western people assosiations to the rebel side of the usa civil war , the southern usa : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_united_states http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/us_south_census.png if you compare that to the novorossija project : http://www.interpretermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/republic-of-novorossiya.jpg ... the idea is quite close . 
  also :  the flag bears a strong , striking resemblance to that of the confederate states of america 's navy jack and battle flag . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] however , pavliv explains that he had simply stumbled upon the flag online somewhere , and that the leader of the new russia party , pavel gubarev , later picked it up . 
  [ 5 ] gubarev has since stated that the inspiration for the flag came from `` banners used by cossacks who reclaimed the new russian territories from tatars and turks for russia in the 18th century '' ; however according to alexey eremenko of the moscow times , no cossacks ever used a flag resembling the one chosen . 
  [ 5 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_federal_state_of_novorossiya the rebel confederation flag is also widely used by neo-nazies all over the world : http://www.themonastery.org/blog/uploaded_images/nazi-confederates2-copy-799383.jpg http://www.art-for-a-change.com/blog/images/aug2005/nazis.jpg http://thestate.typepad.com/bradwarthensblog/images/2007/04/21/flagnazis.jpg gubarev is a well known neo-nazie and sure knows that connotations of that flag . 
  `` south will rise again ! '', 
  is a well known slogan for these people . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/flag_of_novorussia_%28project%29.svg/1280px-flag_of_novorussia_%28project%29.svg.png they have thought of that `` south will rise again '' when they decided to take that `` flag '' to use . 
  and here we see a finn in its natural habitant riding with a rare nordic donkey , dressed in a ancient finnish national costume , thawb and keffiyeh , praising the old finnish pagan god allah ... 
  this is inside ukraine !, 
  this is russian army !,

  the first 10 vechiles are btr-80 's , brdm 's + ( all wheeled , no tracked ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/btr-80 that carries usually 8 soldiers with it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brdm-2 that 's a reconnaissance and patrol model with machine gun . 
  there was also some other same type of machines ? 
  the guy who shots the video says other machines also like `` bmp '' which is a tracked vechile , used by vdv ( special forces , parachute ) ... was there a column ahead of this too ? 
  ( translate anyone ? 
  2:42 he says the date and mentions a place , is it what ? ), 
  but i do n't see the `` peace keepers '' mc sign on any of those . 
  then comes ~ 27 vehicles long supply column with long and short trucks , water and fuel-trucks . 
  some of them have the mc sign . 
  only russian troops use that sign . 
  also there is two or three camo painted trucks which are also painted in russian style . 
  those short trucks usually move heavier stuff like ammo . 
  this is a heavy support column to `` separatists '' . 
  and another clear prove of russia fighting inside ukraine against ukraine army . 
  people , what else do we need ? 
  this is just the opposite action of what lavrov and putin had said . 
  and this is after the last sanctions . 
  they ( russia ) are laughing to west and keep lying again . 
  that column is over 4km long . 
  i 'm sure there 's going to be some satellite/drone picts coming soon to confirm this and the location . 
  they are helping the elite around the world to wash their money clean ... oh , and african dictators , russian oligarchs , putin has billions there , etc. 
  swiss loves you all , equally by the thickness of your wallet . 
   two associates of president vladimir putin profited from a state scheme to buy expensive medical equipment - and sent money to swiss bank accounts linked to a property known as `` putin 's palace '' http://www.reuters.com/investigates/russia/, 
  those are designed to carry and deploy rapidly two battalions of special forces with helicopters and amphibious vehicles + armoured infantry vechiles and/or tanks . 
  they are going to deploy it to the black sea or baltics sea . 
  it would be a perfect attack weapon against ie . 
  ukraine . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship  mistral-class ship is capable of transporting and deploying 16 nh90 or tiger helicopters , four landing barges , up to 70 vehicles including 13 amx-56 leclerc tanks , or a 40-strong leclerc tank battalion , [ 3 ] and 450 soldiers . 
  the ships are equipped with a 69-bed hospital , and are capable of serving as part of a nato response force , or with united nations or european union peace-keeping forces . 
  it can also be a command and control ship :  mistral-class ships can be used as command and control ships , with a 850-square-metre ( 9,100 sq ft ) command centre which can host up to 150 personnel . 
  information from the ship 's sensors is centralised in the senit system ( syst\u00e8me d\u2019exploitation navale des informations tactiques , `` system for naval usage of tactical information '' ) , [ 27 ] this is not only about the ship , it is french selling some awesome technology to russia which it does n't have . 
  how can this be acceptable in this situation when russia is sending troops to ukraine and is responsible for downing the mh17 ? 
   not some sort of card you get to play to get out of any discussion of future military spending you just made those dead soldiers a `` card '' . 
   is that what we should be expecting for any future wars we may fight together ? 
  from the all deaths 90 % were civilians . 
  and in the question of europe vs. russia , no . 
  the death toll will be 90 % europeans ( russia is europe ) . 
  europe has might and formidable military forces . 
  poland it self can mobilize over 600.000 strong army . 
  eu has over 550 million people , russia is 110 million . 
  and this is n't some 3rd world country area we are talking about . 
  the technical and other advance west has is big against russia . 
  russia is no where near the old ussr military strength , it is still using that era equipment , artillery , tanks etc. 
  not to mention aircraft etc. 
  the thing is that european nato countries who do n't have that 2 % military spending , they are already rapidly lifting that up . 
  but it 's also a very marginal question at the moment , it does n't solve anything . 
  the real thing is that nato needs to be united and stop having these quite annoying dilemmas like nsa and other shit . 
  but also there is people who love to see nato/eu being a quarrelling bunch of individual , selfish nations . 
  and those are mainly in russia and china . 
  9 estonians have died for usa in afghanistan . 
  how many usa soldiers have died for estonia ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_casualties_in_afghanistan 43 kia 's from poland . 
  25 kia 's from netherlands . 
  43 kia 's from denmark . 
  5 kia 's from sweden . 
  and sweden ai n't even a nato country . 
  european nato members and even non-members have been backing up usa 20 years now in middle-east with blood , money and moral . 
  finland have been actively in afghanistan and lost 2 kia 's . 
  bottom line ? 
  russia has changed . 
  and you do n't seem to have no clue of the nato forces in europe or national armies . 
  these all are acts what countries do before war . 
  hope that it is n't the case here ... well , there is a war ... :( also it indicates possibly rising anti-war or similar effect in russia . 
  here 's a one we told in finland during the old days ... 
  early in the morning , stalin arrives at his office and opens his window . 
  he sees the sun and says : `` good morning , dear sun ! '' the sun replies : `` good morning , great leader stalin ! '' stalin works , and then at noon he heads to the window and says : `` good afternoon , dear sun ! '' the sun replies : `` good afternoon , great leader stalin ! '' in the evening , stalin calls it a day , and heads once more to the window , and says : `` good evening , dear sun ! '' the sun is silent . 
  stalin gets angry : `` good evening , dear sun !, 
  what 's the matter with you ? '' the sun replies : `` kiss my ass . 
  i 'm in the west now . '', 
  it 's a norwegian-finnish conspiracy against sweden ... / s  do swedes have jokes on dane 's ? 
  or do dane 's joke about ie . 
  about swedes / norwegians ?
