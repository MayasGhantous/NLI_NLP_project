  wou , somebody updated this already to wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otr-21_tochka  russia used the missiles in the chechen wars . 
  [ 3 ]  at least 15 tochka missiles were deployed by russian forces from august 8 -- 11 during the 2008 south ossetia war . 
  [ 4 ]  ** ukraine is alleged to have used the missiles in operations against separatists in the east of the country ** . 
  [ 5 ] but this is not such news that cnn is hyperventilating about . 
  russia has been pounding whole battalions of ukraine army with grad 's and artillery ( even smerch 's ? ) . 
  one grad 's launch carries much more fire power than that one tochka . 
  i believe that ukraine is using it at saur mogilya where they ca n't use air strikes because of heavy anti-aircraft fire ( sam 's and manpads ) and where the strelkov rebels have dug themselves deep and surrounded themselves with minefields ( anti-tank and personnel ) . 
  they 've already tried to capture it with tanks etc. 
  but have heavy casualties . 
  here 's a map : http://i.imgur.com/ux9zjfg.jpg also you can see that the border is open from several places to russia to supply and send troops to the rebels . 
  just do it . 
  and stop whining about it . 
  mind opening !, 
  also i 've noticed some similarities to finland and its situation after the collapse of russian empire in 1916 to the winter war 1939-40 . 
  as we know stalin was trying to get finland in to ussr 's sphere of influence and thought that finland was going to be a easy cake because finland was part of russia just 23 years ago . 
  somehow this all might be the real birth of independent and free ukraine . 
  that 's something very touching . 
  i 'm not scaring anyone . 
  geopolitics are nor about emotions . 
  especially economics . 
  you do n't know how advertising works ? 
  it 's not about the boy , it 's about the lay-out ... 
  it 's very clever , see the story there ... `` putin the satan killed children in the mh17 crash and 1,200 uk troops are getting warm for him in poland . '', 
  that 's the front page in peoples subconscious . 
  i like it . 
  eu and usa will crush the ruble and the revolts starts in russia . 
  russian economy is so small that it ca n't fight against usa and eu economies which are roughly ~ $ 32 trillion , when the russia is only 3.4 trillion ( size of italy ) . 
  it 's easier that way than go to a conventional war what putin wants . 
  of course eu and usa will help ukraine . 
  rebels use high places as artillery spotters and observation spots . 
  also snipers and anti-aircraft missiles are usually on those places . 
  that building was said to not be finished aka no residents . 
  not bad shots if those where artillery with no line of sight . 
  if they really want to do something , they would need support inside fsb , military and other organizations . 
  in ussr usually the head of kgb became the next leader and it 's possibly that if putin needs to go , the next guy is from there . 
  by oligarchs support of course . 
  but putin is ready for this . 
  maybe we are going to see some odd accidents soon ... 
  i did an analyse from one of them to this thread , just scroll ... 
  they are 130mm long range guns and 122mm howitzers ( 6 guns/how 's in battery ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1954_m-46 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/122_mm_howitzer_2a18_%28d-30%29 they are going with close anti-aircraft support ( tracked sam 9k35 and 23mm zu-23-2 's lifted on trucks ) . 
  the mechanized infantry is on the lead with 5 infantry fighting vehicles , bmp-2 's . 
  it has a 30mm autocannon , anti-tank guided missiles and a 7.62 machine-gun . 
  it carries typically 1 +6 soldiers ( plus crew 2-3 ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bmp-2 you can see numbers 002,006 and 014 on the first five bmp 's . 
  then comes the first tracked anti-aircraft missile launcher sam9k35 ( up to range 3,500 m ) with 4 missiles , then bmp-2 and another sam9k35 . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k35_strela-10 then comes two 130mm m-46 's guns towed by a tracked mt-lb . 
  what is intresting is that they are in a hurry and do n't have the covers on the gun . 
  it means that those have just been on a fire mission and are moving to another . 
  then comes the 122mm d-30 battery howitzers , five of them , towed also by mt-lb . 
  what 's intresting is that the 4th mt-lb has `` otshin mnoga '' very many soldiers on it . 
  it looks like the battery 's one gun is towed by a gaz truck behind and the crew is loaded here . 
  they have lost one mt-lb ( technical problems or military ) . 
  then comes one 130mm m-46 and two gaz trucks with 23mm anti-aircraft guns pointed back and the one 122mm howitzer i mentioned . 
  then propably civilian buses , a white van that is waving the `` novorossiya '' flag , a military truck gaz and a white large truck . 
  but also those vehicles could be part of the column !, 
  they can move things in civilian vehicles . 
  and they had . 
  you do n't let civilian vehicles to disturb military convoys , there is usually military police etc. 
  that secures the cross-roads for this . 
  but who knows . 
  when they tow artillery with mt-lb 's ( tracked vehicles ) it 's usually a mechanized infantry brigade formation , otherwise ( with wheels ) it would be motorized infantry brigade . 
  one artillery battery usually does n't move alone , it is three batteries that makes a artillery battalion ( 3 x 6 guns/howitzers ) and that can give some serious fire power . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zu-23 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k35_strela-10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mt-lb map of the current situation in ukraine : http://i.imgur.com/yoo90z3.jpg [ res ignored duplicate image ] this is russian army going into ukraine . 
  could be some reservists and/or volunteers with them , but those weapons are not usable without weeks of training and need trained officers to coordinate that action ( locations , weather reports , calculations , spotters , ammo supply etc. ) . 
  edit : a new situation map -  http://mediarnbo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/28-07-eng.jpg looks like the ukraine army has cut of donetsk and these russian troops are going to there to help separatists flee / re-establish connection to there ? 
  donetsk is the capital city of the area and the donetsk republik will fall if donetsk falls . 
  there is ~ 2 million people in donetsk and the area . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donetsk source : i 'm familiar with all those vehicles and weaponry . 
  i 've been teaching conscripts to use those artillery pieces , both . 
  and of course shoot with them live rounds multiple times . 
  and no , i 'm not a active member of finnish army , i 'm in reserve now . 
  and doing this because i 'm full of this russian propaganda . 
  truth is my co-pilot . 
  i wrote about this column yesterday too , but this is updated version . 
  hope it is helpfull . 
  cheers and good luck !, 
  pray for ukraine !, 
  russian tv is crocodile for your soul ... 
  also swedish and finnish pilots ... , 
  here 's the latest situation in map : http://mediarnbo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/28-07-eng.jpg, 
  wou , it 's actually bbc news : https://twitter.com/bbcdaniels/status/493747974972141568  vladimir antyufeyev says alexander borodai has left donetsk for russia . 
  it 's not clear if he is going back, 
  yes , the white van !, 
  it has a flag and the voice on the video says `` novorossiya '' at 3:19 !, 
  but none of the military vehicles have any kinda insignia and the russian army has adopted that style from last december . 
  edit : add the time, 
  you are derailing the thread . 
  this is not about mh17 . 
  and your message is : people , do n't believe in this video . 
  why ? 
  to blur the shit up ? 
  make people confused and `` yeah , both are dirty , let 's not give a fuck ... '' ? 
  when we have constantly incoming proof that russia is the force behind the `` rebellion '' and that russia is arming them and supplying them and now sending in columns with heavy weaponry ?? 
  you do n't get the point about the flags ? 
  ukraine army carries big ukraine flags so that they can see each others and do n't mix up themselves with the rebels . 
  the rebels mainly do n't carry any insignias or they are very variable like the vostok battalion flag , the novo rossia `` south will rise again '' insignia etc. 
  ukraine army shows clearly who they are and act like a real army and not some bunch of drunk guerrillas . 
  sorry for that btw , it is mainly true and you know it . 
  so , if your message is `` aww , i 'm so confused ...
