  but this anti-russia feeling you have ... do you think they have kinda deserve it during this year ? 
  90 % of redditt is pro-lgbt etc. 
  rights , you think that the russian laws against gay-sexuality has nothing to do with it ? 
  i was long at the / russia trying to find out the russian mindset and feelinks of this ukraine and other things , but now i 'm banned . 
  :( i suggest you go there and try to find some reasons for all of this . 
  you 'll be surprised ... ( ie . 
  the moderators are openly pro-putin . 
  you think that 's the spirit of redditt ? 
  there is already conspiracy theories that it was shot down because there was aids-researchers . 
  russia is very homophobic nation . 
  these things are global nowadays . 
  i 'm sure those media 's who they are working for have given them orders to `` label '' things that the average consumer in tel aviv , moscow or ulan bator gets the joke . 
  otherwise it may feel too snobby or something something . 
  i 'm smoking lucky strike and this is the page you have linked to : http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%b2_%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%93%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b8_%281945 \u0412 \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c . 
  [ wikipedia has no article with this title . ], 
  it gave another link and i google translated it . 
  it was about violence against germany . 
  it is totally different page . 
  yeah , french makes warships faster to russia than a 10billion $ nuclear plant to finland which is 6 years late and has so many issues that it probably wo n't get a permission to go on/off . 
  your link is to a page that does n't exist . 
  instead it linked me to a page what is totally different from the : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany ... page , it was apage that talked about `` violence against the civilian population of germany at the end of world war ii '' . 
  not a mention of rape . 
  : http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%b2_%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%93%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b8_%281945%29 no , it does not exist in russian . 
  and that south korean thing :  many south korean websites require the submission of a valid resident registration number in order for users to register an account . 
  that is totally different thing . 
  you can write anonymous blogs in south-korea . 
  just wait for it ... 
  i 'm getting tired of this merkel . 
  why is she keeping up this nsa shit when clearly there is a rising mega-threat rising in east ( see -  putin , russia ) . 
  is she playing a game here ? 
  is she muddling the waters ? 
  covering up the big business deals , securing germany 's gas ? 
  what 's this shit ? 
  wake up germany , this is europe calling !, 
  seriously , germany lost the war and was pressured to make those laws , it was n't actually my point . 
  the point here ( which was cleverly disguised by putin ) is that you ca n't write about ie . 
  the ussr 's red army 's rapings in germany :  the majority of the assaults were committed in the soviet occupation zone ; estimates of the numbers of german women raped by soviet soldiers ranged up to 2 million . 
  [ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] in many cases women were the victims of repeated rapes , some as many as 60 to 70 times . 
  [ 10 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany that whole wikipedia page is now illegal in russia . 
  and that is just a one example . 
  also if you want to write a blog in russia , you need to be registered to the authorities :  putin signs law forcing bloggers to register with russian media office http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/7/5690410/putin-signs-law-forcing-bloggers-to-register-with-russian-media-office, 
   holy christ is / r/mapporn ever going down in quality fast . 
  not worthless . 
  but together stronger . 
  this is how it starts ... 
  yep . 
  it 's called freedom of speech . 
  seriously , like what laws and countries ? 
  edit : i forget the sarcasm tag . 
  well , the quad-copters are nowadays pretty good and cheap , they got gps , hd cams and shit . 
  there are even commercial drones . 
  here is a downed russian military drone in ukraine : http://i.imgur.com/gdqgir1.jpg but yes , you are correct . 
  this is completely different now and the media is busy counting the bodies of mh17 . 
  this russian artillery shelling and grad shelling is begging to get confirmed . 
  and west has to act very hard on that because it is a real act of war !, 
  to this point the russia has cleverly disguised it 's actions in east-ukraine in the media , social-media etc. 
  even here on reddit . 
  there are several intelligent shills here who act deliberately against ukraine and are payed by russian government . 
  there is also a bunch , much bigger bunch of not-so-clever shills here also . 
  and all over the internet . 
  this is information war going on live . 
  and we are in it . 
  this ai n't something `` bullshitrolling '' game any-more ** people of usa and canada and australia ** this is ** war ** . 
  people are dying for their country , ukraine , and they are fighting against 100x bigger russia who is shooting them with artillery , ak 's , tanks , missiles , everything ... and shooting down commercial air-planes . 
  ** do you here ukraine now ? 
  ** please forgive me for shouting . 
  i 'm so mad against this russian bullshit what comes from every channel they got . 
  this is so frustrating sometimes . 
  but there is also good news , here is a picture from severodonetsk which was liberated yesterday : http://i.imgur.com/6xeq3mx.jpg http://i.imgur.com/lvh0l1x.jpg and for russians who get mad and start yelling that it is racist etc. 
  to generalize them as whateva ' shills , putinists , murderers etc. 
  i would say that yes , it is , but the blame goes to putin and his internet team . 
  they have used and mixed up the whole terminology with all this pro-russian , ethnic russian , donbass republic , nazi-kiev , pro-russian russian , pro-ukraine russian , anti-putin , gayrope etc. 
  media language ( propaganda ) . 
  while it has always been clear and simple : it is ukraine vs. russia . 
  it 's like germany and nazies during the ww2 . 
  in this case the germany is russia and the nazies are those who support putin and his actions . 
  and sorry again . 
  did n't mean to get this deep but this is the wake up call , act before it gets reeeaaaal ugly . 
  from finland with love . 
  finland does not . 
  no it wo n't . 
  yes , because it keeps them out of jail . 
  putin has even ordered a law how to think :  the law putin signed on may 5 introduces punishment of up to ** five years in prison ** or a fine of some 500,000 rubles ( some $ 14,000 ) for anyone found guilty of denying facts established by the nuremberg trials regarding the crimes of axis powers . 
   the law also punishes those who knowingly disseminate `` false information about the soviet activities '' during world war ii . 
  http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-criminalizes-nazi-denial/25373990.html this is wonderful comrades , our glorious leader knows how to have sex , how to think and how to kick the shit out of those kiev-nazi ukrainians , slava rossija , slava sta ... putin !, 
  he was using the same style of argumenting and propaganda talk what the reds ( bolsheviks ) used in russia . 
  it was oddly similar . 
  and those classes ... 
  but it was just a thought . 
  for russia military is politics . 
  `` war is the continuation of politics by other means . '', 
  wake up man !, 
  this came first to my mind : http://i.imgur.com/c4ujsq4.jpg trotsky . 
  putin thinks they do harm . 
  let 's take france in if they drop out the warship deal with russia ? 
  ah yes , here is an excellent video compilation about that buk as far as we know : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt6celghize#t=209, 
  can you be sure what eyes are watching you from the sky ? 
  and that would the picts be in the next days newspaper ? 
  buck or buk ? 
  exactly .
