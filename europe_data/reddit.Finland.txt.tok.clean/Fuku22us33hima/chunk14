  the peking olympics was a great example of this . 
  also these kinda projects are a very attempting events to do serious money-laundering ( not to mention sport betting ) , waste billions of tax-payer money to politicians supporters ( like putin giving certain oligarchs huge deals to build up some shit or catering or advertising etc. ), 
  i would like to see the wc2018 taken away from russia . 
  it would be an excellent sanction because it does n't cost jobs for usa or eu people . 
  it could be opposite : give the wc2018 to france and germany jointly . 
  and the france can then drop the warship deal with russia . 
  brilliant\u00e8 ? 
  even if that guy is trolling , he is giving an straight view to the mindset of russian army : they are ready to roll . 
  but yes , that is little too obvious , the lack of camouflage ( sats and drones are 24/7 monitoring that area ) is telling that this might not be true . 
  on the otherhand , you do n't need it at nights ... ( move to another firing position , shoot and move again ) . 
  that cannon in the pictures are 130mm towed field gun m-46 :  the 130 mm towed field gun m-46 m1954 ( russian : 130-\u043c\u043c \u043f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 m-46 \u043e\u0431\u0440 . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/130_mm_towed_field_gun_m1954_%28m-46%29 it 's max range is 27km and with assisted rounds 38km . 
  those barrels seem to at the highest elevation it gets , 45 ^ o degrees . 
   in soviet service m-46 battalions were in army and front artillery brigades . 
  i 've shot with that gun myself , it 's still in use in finnish defence forces , remnants of the ussr days when we were forced to by a lot of ussr stuff . 
  it 's old gun but does it job . 
  seriously outdated anyway , it 's from 1950 's ... 
  but every hour we are getting more and more proof of russian direct involvement in ukraine . 
  this shit is about to blow ... 
  who would believe that the russia will be in this phase 5 years ago ? 
  or during the sochi olympics ? 
  are the people in russia believing that they are as might as the ussr was ( militarily ) ? 
  in fact they are 1/10 ^ th of the strength of those days and their equipment is 80 % from the 1970 's era . 
  also their gdp is the size of italy and there is only 110million people in russia ( eu is 550million ) . 
  this is one reason putin is using this kinda warfare in ukraine . 
  he massed 45,000 + troops to the ukraine border two months ago but pulled them back and realised that he 'll be fucked if he would go in with tank spearheads and btr columns . 
  not that ukraine army could n't stop them effectively , but that the world would have crushed russia 's economy and his people would have revolt against him . 
  now he keeps doing this `` arming at nights '' operation and `` maskirovka '' in media ( maskirovka is russian disguising , hazing the truth behind lies and false truth etc. ) . 
  he has done great job at the russian media to rally his people and his popularity ratings are amazingly high . 
  those numbers are so high that it looks like the country is getting ready for war . 
   russia 's defense spending has nearly doubled since 2010 , reaching a total of $ 70 billion this year . 
  http://natocouncil.ca/the-price-of-complacency/ be aware . 
  putin might go for a war because it could be his last resort to maintain power . 
  if he fails in ukraine , people will start asking ugly questions and with the down spiralling economy the maidan effect could hit moscow ... 
  here is another piece and analyse : http://defensetech.org/2014/07/21/mh17-wreckage-photo-shows-evidence-of-shrapnel/  mh17 wreckage photo shows evidence of shrapnel, 
  ... and not spread them a cross 20 square miles over ukraine fields ... 
  buk missile can reach mach 3 speed : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buk_missile_system, 
  france , if you do this , you 'll be my new best friend !, 
  yes , pretty much this . 
  i think that israel also is getting ready for the isis escalation and shows some real mothe ` fukkin power , that do n't mess with us . 
  pre-emptive shit , have to be done . 
  but yes , hamas is shit and israel has many enemies . 
  hope the best for all . 
  thank you , i send a post and will delete this one . 
  i did report it but i got this answer from a moderator / noviy-login :  and this guy is a foreign fighter and a neo nazi . 
  this is exactly what everyone was afraid of , and this is the proof . 
  we are not deleting this , this is news . 
  how do i report to the admins ? 
  i just want to keep reddit clean from doing same mistakes what happened during the boston bombings . 
  says the guy who uses a country 's flag that sell weapons to russia . 
  yeah , well by the russian media kiev is under nazi control and russians believe that they are fighting against re-born nazi-gayrope monster that is penetrating to their holy motherland ... and since when you can accidentally shoot down a commercial plane with aa-missile ? 
  whoops ... sorry , i thought you were a . . something else . . 
  they are mass murderers until proven otherwise . 
  * you know , there was the top aids researchers of the world in the plane and russia hate gays . 
  maybe it was deliberate after all ? 
  yes , this is conspiracy theory but the next speculation level could be this . 
  it does n't matter what you call them any more , they just murdered 300 people on live pre-dinner tv . 
  use what ever word you like . 
  for me they are terrorists . 
  they are not exactly the sharpest pens in the box . 
  in europe ( and russia ) criminals etc. 
  trust in prepaid sim cards and several old nokia 's . 
  they just keep swapping the cards and phones and changing the phones with each others constantly . 
  that 's what they think is secure enough . 
  and the rebels/separatists/terrorists do n't have long range radio 's or satellite phone 's ~ ~ enough ~ ~ to give them everybody or unit . 
  also a leader probably has a couple of phones for different channels ( one for his boss , one for his units etc. ) . 
  that 's how they do it on the street level . 
  and prepaid sim 's are cheap . 
  and phones . 
  i was wondering too that they used the moscow word , but this is a completely new situation . 
  they probably have cover words for their own stuff , like locations , weapons and they probably use fake calls too . 
  but this is such a major clusterfuck that they are in panic and the pressure is enormous . 
  they have no time to cover things and that 's why they just have to say things clear and loud to get the message through . 
  also the pressure from moscow must be tense and they fear that they 'll be abandoned by putin : it would be their end . 
  they have to make thousands of phone-calls over this situation and those who are clever enough can hide some keywords but it 's always this level that fucks up the most : the last chain . 
  to explain to the separatist-grunt-cossack who is drunk and ptsd you have to say it like it is . 
  * actually it is a world wide method to use old phones and pre paids to communicate among criminals : here is a pict from uk : * [ four nokia 's in shoes in prison .

   it is us intelligence who is intercepting all the calls source ? 
  those first ones are flares and those parachutes are ukraine supplies and re-inforcment for the encircled ukraine troops , here 's another video :  \u0421\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0410\u041d 26 , \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043b \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 20 07 2014 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_9xejfrhio so no downed plane . . ? 
  this is understandable . 
  many times nations that are or have been oppressed by a bigger nation ( like ireland vs. uk ) take the side of the smaller , oppressed one . 
  the israel actions are way over human limits and very rude . 
  they are close to a mass murder limit and should stop before they loose their credibility or what 's left of it . 
  and btw , vladimir putin is supporting israel :  putin : ' i support the struggle of israel ' http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/news.aspx/182754 is this because he is acting almost similarly against ukraine ? 
  also the shooting of the rockets by hamas was very stupid . 
  what could they gain from that ? 
  this bloodbath ? 
  do they really think it was going to look them as martyrs or saints ? 
  this whole shit is stupid as it gets . 
  the world has seen this 4eva going middle-east conflict ( since 1950 's ) and is getting tired of both sides ... 
  are you really a finn ? 
  because you are linking to esko aho , who is the most hated prime-minister in finland and still so hated that even his own party , keskusta , is afraid to use him in any election campaigns or tv shit etc. 
  also you are saying that ...  the natural gas power plant next to my house which gives me hot water and electricity does ' t get that gas from fairies or do you have a better solution for our heating an electricity needs ? 
  only 10 % of all energy is produced by gas in finland . 
  we can drop that use easily . 
  peat , wind , water , nuclear , gas from norway , koivuhalko , or even perkele can easily solute that `` problem '' . 
   these borderline neo-con capitalists in helsinki these days seems to have no idea off the past :d and you were sayin ' that a gas plant is producing heat and electro to you beside your house ? 
  those things are probability 95 % in helsinki . 
  also neo-con capitalist ?
