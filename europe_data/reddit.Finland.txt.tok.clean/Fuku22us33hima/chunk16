  and for the european leaders , like ukip and le pen : fuck you with your putin licking . 
  and this goes to others too . 
  fuck russian gas and oil , fuck it , fuck it fuck it !, 
  i am too . 
  if our leaders wo n't act strong , we people will . 
  here is pictures of a buk missile system in donetsk at the pro-russian terrorists hands : http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=222226&amp;d=1405622086 http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=222247&amp;d=1405639266 they are from yesterday . 
  ukraine army aa units have straight contact to international airspace monitoring ( there is nato awacs and other things keeping them informed etc. ), 
  and they have not need to shoot anything down because the pro-russian terrorists do n't have aircraft . 
  i 've been monitoring this ukraine conflict over 6 months now , quite close and i am 100 % sure that it was the pro-russians or russians . 
  i 'm a finn and have military training and a rank over lieutenant . 
  we have that similar missile system in use in finland ( not for long ) . 
  just to say i 'm familiar with that kinda weaponry . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/9k37_buk_m1_sa-11_gadfly.jpg i doubt russian army also because they can also monitor airspace and rule out civilian aircraft . 
  but the donetsk terrorists ( i do n't call them `` separatists '' any more because they are now proven to be real terrorists ) could easily , knowing them being all kinda people from street criminals to nazies and x-military guys and russian military advisors , insurgents and war tourists , shoot down anything that moves . 
  those massive idiots . 
  they managed to raise a furry that will burn them in hell multiple times . 
  and they deserve it . 
  it is time to set un peacekeeping operation and go in . 
  no more putin licking , no more whining '' whattabout gas whattabout oil '' , it 's just fuck it . 
  russia and/or the pro-russian terrorists have to be brought to justice and jailed . 
  no more fifa world championships 2018 in russia , no more french warship deals to russia and london can stop the russian dirty money-laundering . 
  because this is going to end now . 
  one way or another . 
  154 dutch nationals , 27 australians , 23 malaysian , 11 indonesians , six british nationals , four germans , four belgians , three filipinos and one canadian , the nationality of 47 other passengers has not yet been determined . 
  one source says 21 usa citizens . 
  r i p . 
  fuck off , russians just shot down a boieng 777 killing 300 people . 
  lock and load !, 
  it 's time to go !, 
  russians are shooting down europeans from the sky and knocking our doors !, 
  i did n't want this , but you , polite people keep just carrying your pics of jesus and mary and acting like drunken cossacks on a whorehouse ... fuck everything with your `` holy novorossiya '' , fuck your glorious bald leadershipness , fuck your stinky oil and fart gas , we do n't need them . 
  you are worst than taliban , they mind their own stuff , you just keep playing innocent and pretending smart ... fuck that , fuck everything with that , you want war , you got war , ponimaiju ? 
  leader of donetsk terrorists . 
  now they are really terrorists . 
  no single fucking doubt of that . 
  congratulations mr. putin . 
  novorossiya project going smooth as hell . 
  smooth as hell . 
  90 % of eu is nato . 
  forgetting something here ? 
  yes . 
  it is our business . 
  do n't know that are you really a bavarian , but defending each others is one of the key elements in eu and europe . 
  with your attitude ( might be just trolling ? ), 
  you are just inviting the enemy to your gates . 
  nobody here is talking about attacking russia , it is russia who is attacking europe . 
  deal with it . 
  crawl under your bed and suck your thumb .

  did the negotiations in rio de janeiro went wrong ? 
  ** do n't feed **, 
  is much less than 75 % . 
  and by all means not `` dependable '' . 
  russia has been massing troops for at least a week to the ukraine border : http://www.reddit.com/r/russiandefense/comments/2aawtm/russia_massing_troops_again_to_the_ukraine_border/ i 've been watching this with a great concern , but seems like the football wc2014 has taken most peoples interest . 
  this is exactly what putin did during sochi . 
  olympics . 
  and here we go again . 
  is there still anyone who trust this `` man '' ? 
  he stabs you right in the back and plays innocent . 
  now wake up europe !, 
  reddittor for 6 days and comments like these :  hahahhaha ill ask you in a couple of weeks . 
  little anti russian scum on the internet . 
  i hope the fsb is collecting your data if u rly live in russia and you call me trolling ? 
  all the thanks goes to putin 's `` clever '' kiev nazi propaganda . 
  ... and then they scan the documents and send them with emails ... 
  butt klose enugh . 
  putin : look at falklands !, 
  ( then he goes and attacks ukraine ... ), 
  merkel , do n't try to change the primary subject : ukraine and russia . 
  of course the climate is important but a war on european soil is imo much worrying now . 
  and it 's dividing france , uk and germany from the eastern , nordic and other europeans at the moment . 
   flight altitude 3.5 kilometres ( 11,000 ft ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grom_%28missile%29 same as igla :  flight ceiling 3.5 km ( 11,000 ft ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k38_igla aa missiles can have more horizontal reach ( 5.5 km for grom and igla ) . 
  from this picture you can see that they can possibly hit the 5.5 km spot but it is only the one direct line and very rare to hit : http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/01/manpad.jpg, 
  russia has increased its military activity a lot . 
  it 's unsure about the crimea annexation ( would it hold ) and is near a full scale war with ukraine . 
  it checks the activity and readiness of nato and other bordering nations that are they beefing up because of this and also doing intelligence , elint , sigint etc. 
  stuff . 
  this is not a `` daily routine '' stuff any more folks , this is serious . 
  un secretary general after letting eu more divided than ever ? 
  or european council with all that putin loving ? 
  i do n't trust her any more ... 
  germany . 
  obviously because we both are aaa countries ... :d * ... waiting for nazi-cards in 3 . .2 ... *, 
  well , i bet argentina would be preparing to invade malvinas if they had won and that defenetly would disturb the sleep ... 
  actually , no ...  the ak-101 is designed for the world export market , using 5.56 \u00d7 45mm nato cartridges , which is the standard of most nato armies . 
  the ak-101 is marketed at those looking for a weapon that combines the logistical compatibility and familiarity of the 5.56 \u00d7 45mm nato round with the reliability of a kalashnikov . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-101 but if you see the an-94 ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an-94 ... that 's a sure sign of russian special forces etc. 
  congratulations germany , you deserve it !, 
  that was a perfect game to watch , a real fight !, 
  and the goal ... \u00fcber cool !, 
  bad news ... 
  so you admit it . 
  proof ? 
  there is whole groups from russia ( cossacks , ossetians , kirkin , etc. ), 
  who went to east-ukraine without russian border guards stopping them , and with their own weapons , rpg 's etc. 
  and it 's been all over the news multiple times . 
  either you are stupid or trolling ... 
  yes it is , ukraine . 
  if you annex a huge chunk of another nation and support rebels there with weapons , ammo , propaganda and have active media war against it , it is a war . 
  this whole spying thing is getting laughable .
