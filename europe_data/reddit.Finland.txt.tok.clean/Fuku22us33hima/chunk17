  at the meanwhile russia is annexing ukraine and threatening the whole stability of europe and the union with ultra-nationalists etc. 
  and merkel is playing butthurt because she was stupid enough to believe that phones are safe ? 
  wtf , she was raised in ddr ( east-germany ) and should know these things . 
  at the mean while east-european countries , nordics and others are piling up guns and ammo because the leadership of russia is unpredictable and future is grey .

  edit : i posted this to the / russiandefense two says ago : http://www.reddit.com/r/russiandefense/comments/2aawtm/russia_massing_troops_again_to_the_ukraine_border/, 
  you can bet about if there would be wc2018 in russia : http://www.oddschecker.com/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018/russia-to-host-2018-world-cup people are tired of fifa giving these wc 's to countries that have major humanitarian and/or corruption problems . 
  russia is having a war against smaller nation right now and is tightening control over minorities etc. 
  lol what ? 
  that gubarev is pro-russian , fighting against `` kiev-nazi 's '' as the russian propaganda has said . 
  never underestimate the stupidity of the human race ... / facepalm, 
  looks like gubarev ( well known nazi btw ) is not confident . 
  and the guards around him tells a lot . 
  they are not having strong support . 
   gubarev was a member of the neo-nazi russian national unity paramilitary group . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] gubarev has publicly given thanks to this group for providing him with military training . 
  [ 14 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_gubarev, 
  russia is more a `` belief '' concept than a rationally based western democracy . 
  and nationalism is strong , and they believe that they are strong which is some kinda illusion based on the vast area , but in reality their population is only 110 million ( eu is 550 million ) and their economy is even 10x smaller than eu . 
  and of course the nukes ( `` we can destroy the world '' ) . 
  but yes , my sentence was illogical , it 's not true that we ca n't understand . 
  us have bases which are rented areas , like air-force etc. 
  which are used ie . 
  during iraq and afghanistan , balkan operations . 
  they are also working with fully co-operation with the nato troops that the countries have . 
  also european nato members train in usa and are in fully co-operation in afghanistan etc. 
  it is a coalition . 
  during the cold war , when germany did n't have military power and the ussr was ready to attack europe , it was clear that usa was deeply confronting ussr on the european soil . 
  with uk , france and many others . 
  usa has drawn a lot of troops from europe since the cold war ended but now situation is changing . 
  yes , it will drown the $ uro too . 
  that 'll be devastating for all of us . 
  very good article . 
  this needs to be discussed and we need real answers germany . 
  also france and uk . 
  what 's the deal , has putin been generous with his gas , oil and money for you guys ? 
  are you ready to forget east-europe just because of gas and few ship orders ? 
   they also say that it is impossible for an outsider to ever fully understand russia that 's an ancient myth . 
  and could be reversed also : russians can never fully understand west . 
  but it is not true . 
  the thing is that even russians themselves do n't understand `` russia '' . 
  they have been exposed to such brainwashing and lack of true information that they do n't have tools to dig out what 's really going on . 
  when they get confused , they seek comfort from nostalgia , history and mystic elements like orthodoxy ( it 's not rational , it 's closer to islam and east than ie . 
  protestantism or catholicism ) . 
  also they have this alphabet barrier and they do n't teach other languages in schools like west does so they grow up in a `` barrel '' . 
  also they have been under `` slavery '' for so long that it is in their culture / still strong :  in 1382 the golden horde under khan tokhtamysh sacked moscow , burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves ; such raids were made routinely until well into the 16th century . 
  [ 8 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_russia the tsar 's did n't end the slavery , it was one of the reasons why october revolution started 1917 . 
  russian are ready to be under harsh order , it is their historical tradition . 
  and stalin is seen as a great man because he was slavering the nation and brought great success by conquering half of europe and sending a man to space . 
  even he killed 20 million of his own people . 
  and those who might have a different opinion , they are silenced . 
  by a nagant or other ( siberia ) methods . 
   i want the us out of nato , and out of europe . 
  it is beyond ridiculous that we are occupying rich , industrialized and technically advanced countries that have their own arms industry so long after wwii and the cold war . 
  occupying ? 
  any examples ? 
  and nato ... you do understand that europe might not want to shoot down russian nukes flying over europe to usa then ( if usa gets out of nato ? ) . 
  if usa will lost it 's credibility ... then the dollar will collapse and usa 's economy will sink like the titanic ... 
  exactly . 
  very fucked up . 
  dugin sees that finland should be russia :  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics also :  ** russia should use its special forces within the borders of the united states ** to fuel instability and separatism . 
  for instance , provoke `` afro-american racists '' . 
  russia should `` introduce geopolitical disorder into internal american activity , encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic , social and racial conflicts , actively supporting all dissident movements -- extremist , racist , and sectarian groups , thus destabilizing internal political processes in the u.s. 
  it would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in american politics . 
  '' [ 1 ] russia is already using far-righters and neo-nationalists etc. 
  in europe to fuel separatism and instability . 
  that man is crazy and a dangerous . 
  i 'm disappointed too . 
  however , we might partly thank russian propaganda during maidan / ukraine crises about this . 
  they revoked the `` nazi '' theme and lifted stalin from it 's grave . 
  in reality they shoot themselves to the leg and it is not even sure they ( russia ) will host the next wc 2018 ... [ world cup 2018 - russia to host 2018 world cup ? 
  betting odds ] ( http://www.oddschecker.com/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018/russia-to-host-2018-world-cup ) yes , it 's true , you can bet about it ... 
  but the game , germany was really good , but brazil ... it was so bad that is it fishy ... some betting odds were total goals 6 + : x 3,000 , germany wins by 3 + goals : x 1,500 , either team wins by score not listed in odds : x 10,000 ... etc. 
  this must be investigated . 
  i 'm not sayin ' germany was behind this , of course not . 
  but the lately reveals of italian game manipulations , referees judged for this , the far-east betting markets and mafias , it is not impossible that brazil did this ... well , the odds are small but still . 
  hope we see germany - dutch final !, 
  oh , just fuck off . 
  spiced with habanero . 
  no , we just watched 90 minutes of money laundering . 
  nej men det \u00e4r i finland-svenska , it is in the finnish-sweden dialect . 
  '' * r\u00f6r * '' is also hole . 
  and hit the nuke button . 
  almost . 
  july is the month most people have their vacations . 
  ** finland ** we have summer at last . 
  whole nation is out on the summer cottages and festivals chilling and going nuts , we are high and ai n't complaining anything !, 
  few beers , sauna and skinny dipping ... aaaahhh , this is life at its best !, 
  good news . 
  slava ukraine !, 
  marie le pen keeps giving ... 
  we hate russia . 
  umh ... no . 
  berluscone and putin , both very mucho fuckin rich . 
  and both have gained their wealth and power by very not-democratic ways . 
  i 'm 100 % sure that they both have helped wash criminal money , helped each other politically etc. 
  mafia in russia and italy surely need both each others , globalization right ? 
  ** finland ** i would change the name of our country to perkele .
