  and do a pre-emptive strike to russia and take back the [ petsamo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/petsamo.png ) area in north that has a coast line with north sea and we will become a oil producer . 
  also i would legalize gay-marriage , cannabis and get a full membership of nato and declare a complete tax-free year or two for the citizens of new glorious perkele !, 
  :d our new national song would be `` show me how to die '' from battle beast : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eyavgoyhey, 
  more this . 
  less ukip and le pen shit . 
  * yes , less anti-europe shit in every country . 
  stop whining and start working . 
  there is nothing free in this world . 
  your user-name is a well known `` finland 's eater '' stalin 's loyal puppet , a finnish otto wille kuusinen : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_wille_kuusinen so i presume you have all good attentions ... , 
  zizek should shut up . 
  he does n't have a clue what 's going on in reality . 
  he has his twisted , narcissistic , over-drived world where he keeps spitting `` magical '' words from philosophy and religion , communism etc. 
  trying to mesmerise people , like a agitator meets a stand-up comedian ... 
  he is kinda modern day rasputin preaching about bad , promising good and actually getting some student pussy all over the world . 
  good for him , but seriously ... 
  i can take him not . 
  the last one asked russian army to come into ukraine :  yanukovych asked putin to use russian army to `` restore order in ukraine '' http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/194176.html ... and they came and took crimea and are now threatening the whole country . 
  italians liked also mussolini and hitler , the good vibes started after the ww2 when the biggest butt to lick in europe was stalin and sam . 
  italy in fact got a major car deal to russia in the 60 's :  already in the 1960s , italy 's fiat built a car-assembling plant in the soviet city of tolyatti ( a city named after the italian communist party 's secretary palmiro togliatti ) . 
  also :  italy is russia 's second most important commercial partner in the eu , after germany , and its state-owned energy company , eni , has recently signed a very important long-term contract with gazprom , to import russian gas into italy . 
   in modern times russia has a privileged relationship [ 2 ] with italy . 
  the silvio berlusconi governments ( 2001 -- 2006 and 2008-2011 ) strengthened italy 's ties with russia , due to his personal friendship with president vladimir putin . 
  cooperation extends also to the aviation sector , between italy 's alenia and russia 's sukhoi , who are jointly developing a new aircraft . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italy%e2%80%93russia_relations yes , you are right . 
  the question is , does italy like russia more than eu ? 
  what 's the vibes ? 
  how about nato ? 
  [ their relationship ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1698589/thumbs/o-berlusconi-facebook.jpg ) would be actually illegal now in russia ... / kindasarcasm considering the strong mafia culture in italy and corruption in russia , there is some ties between those countries ( leaders ) that are strong . 
  and that ai n't pizza . 
  that was sarcasm i suppose ? 
  i think the writer victor yerojev has good observations of russia : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrdcova_kc interview , 5:15 . 
  as a finn this is nothing new . 
  during the cold war the soviets had regular check tours in our military bases etc. 
  we were followed closely because both sides wanted to know which way we were going to shoot our weapons if the big shit hits the fan . 
  however it is not likely that usa would need to spy us that hard because we are now a headache to moscow . 
  yes , more likely it is russia with china that is behind this . 
  or the sneaky swedes ... , 
  ... and that 's the problem . 
  france , germany and austria , also uk makes business with russia over other countries and do n't give a shit about poland , baltics , romania , ukraine etc. 
  it 's happened before and we all know how that ended . 
  russia is doing this precisely to make eu more unstable . 
  it is using economy as a tool and i 'm quite sure there is some dirty money moving between these leaders , like the german schr\u00f6der who is working for gazprom ( the gas pipe from russia to germany ) and the french warship deals , the new gas-pipe deal with austria etc. 
  but look how it treats countries bordering it ? 
  molotov-ribbentrop anyone ? 
  are these france , germany etc. 
  putting their own economical interests ahead of the eu ? 
  you really trust russia ? 
  you 're right . 
  russia is tightening up . 
  looks like putin is having some troubled waters ahead ... 
  that was imo the best game we 've seen so far in brasil !, 
  keep it up !, 
  putin just signed a law against `` internet extremist '' ,  putin signs law giving prison terms for internet extremism http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/putin-signs-law-giving-prison-terms-for-internet-extremism/502717.html now we need actions , mr. putin . 
  there is at least two kinds of euro-skeptism in nordic countries , it fact no nordic [ sweden , norway , denmark , finland , iceland ] country are alike , ie . 
  norway : no eu , yes nato , no $ ; sweden : yes eu , no nato , no $ ; denmark : yes eu , yes nato , no $ ; finland : yes eu , no nato , yes $ ; iceland : no eu , yes nato , no $ ( and no army ) . 
  one trend is that people are pro-eu but want the `` bad economy '' mediterranean countries out , or at least out of $ uro . 
  however , even the most anti-eu party basic finns ( support 15 % ) has toned down the anti-eu voice , thanks to russia ... 
  norway and oil is not a myth : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_production it produces over three time more than libya . 
  and did n't touch the gas production yet ...  but with no offence , norway is a awesome country !, 
  still some people wonder why they do n't join eu ? 
  macedonia no oil , norway plenty oil . 
  besides , you can make posts like this from any country , just go and pick up some nasty narc junk and compare it to some nice place . 
  meaningless . 
  ah , how wonderful , a l\u00e9 france national front far-righter is telling us to move closer to russia ... well , you can lift up your ass and just go there to see by yourself how wonderful that future is ... 
  the only thing we are moving closer to russia is our military . 
  from love from finland . 
  nato . 
  lavrov , that sneaky bastard , want europe to make distance to that . 
  not going to happen . 
  ** finland ** snow melted and turned into horny female blood sucker mosquitoes . 
  lot 's of casualties . 
  yes ... 
  i was trying to have a conversation on / russia about womens in management jobs and suddenly i was a racist , hitler-fan etc. . . http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/295pw4/women_in_business_report_shows_that_43_of_russias/ciiaau7?context=3, 
  comparing to the latest popularity ratings ( 87 % or smthing ) this 66 % is not much ... 
  rt. . . nothing to say . 
  no no no , you are getting it wrong again ... you are spreading this rumor of fat americans eating russian children 's because russia needs scared paperless people from ukraine to full-fill the liver and kidney-shortage on rich peoples alcohol diseases . 
  moscow is eager for young organs , just look at the government : http://en.ria.ru/images/18156/12/181561227.jpg look at those grey heads . 
  soon it is like this : http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/2010/gorbachev/mikhail_gorbachev_02.jpg, 
  the writer is an old school snob , besserwisser , who nobody takes seriously here in finland . 
  russian tactics : a low rank politician plays the bad cop and tests the reactions . 
  then putin came and plays the `` nice guy '' ... but nobody believes him anymore . 
  nato . 
  the nuclear weapons , which is the main threat russia fears , are 90 % in the usa hands . 
  and europe needs them . 
  otherwise europe faces the russian nuclear threat with almost no possibility to make a counter strike . 
  yes of course , we are together . 
  http://i.imgur.com/9pmietv.jpg russia makes money then like new york ... 
  here is something you should see , this is ria novosti , 10th june ( english subs ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwt5hm_nmli&amp;feature=share putin 's economic adviser is saying that usa is going to attack russia with ukraine ... and is ready to use ie . 
  neutron bombs etc. 
  that is the reality inside russia right now . 
  even the rt is like a shitty blowjob comparing to this level of war hysteria and propaganda . 
  russia is not kidding . 
  you must be right !, 
  it was the cookies or silly cats that start this all ... http://assets2.neurope.eu/sites/default/files/styles/775x432/public/putin_yanukovych.jpg?itok=rvxhar0j&amp;c=e4c723159e12139fd9acda0e7b30542b, 
  what ? 
   there are no keyloggers or backdoors anywhere in their computers ... that 's what they think ... 
  ah , youtube comments ... 
  i stopped reading them years ago ...  shills , trolls , wackos , mental cases etc. 
  the maidan was against all corruption in ukraine . 
  the people want a new change to all that old oligarchy system .
