  poroshenko is the least bad option now and there is a war going on . 
  first they have to stabilize the country . 
  yes , it 's been divided and that has been bad desicions all the way . 
  the road to real democracy is not easy . 
  there are solutions . 
  but when russia starts to invading parts of ukraine ... and supports rebels who are mostly thugs and mafia guys , nazies and others , russians who come over the border to fight , that is not more about divided country , that is an invasion . 
  putin is scared . 
  that could happen in russia too . 
  what ? 
  ... with that username ... :d, 
  there was 3 brigades invading crimea from central military district and lots of other elements . 
  very good post !, 
  however , calling this `` civil war '' is not right because it is actually russia ( putin ) fighting about control of ukraine or parts of it with the help of ethnic-russians , pro-russians etc. 
  in ukraine . 
  a `` pure '' example of civil war was the american civil war 1861-65 . 
  we 've had a civil war also in finland 1916 . 
  and crimea . 
  the seeds of the control were planted when yanukovych got power . 
  and putins government has made obvious mistakes when maidan happened . 
  was the 89 murdered in maidan authorized by yanukovych or putin ? 
  were is yanukovych now ? 
  yes , in russia . 
  it 's really important that you show what kinda `` leaders '' there is in east-ukraine . 
  in many pictures , videos etc. 
  i have seen `` titutshki '' , criminals , hooligans who fight for money and yanukovych hired those people to attack ie . 
  in maidan . 
  is those people hired by the pro-russian people ? 
  and are they fleeing from the ranks because they are actually cowards ? 
  it 's good to hear that there is pro-ukraine `` oligarchs '' and it 's important to west to understand that we should support the economy of ukraine . 
  there is rumors that yanukovych , who stole billions of ukraine people money , is funding the separatism from rostov-na-don , russia . 
  to call the separatists as terrorists is imo quite accurate because they are working for a outside power ( russia ) and want to break a sovereign country . 
  and they use terror methods like kidnapping and assassin , executions etc. 
  this situation is affecting us also . 
  we are having serious discussions about applying a membership of nato . 
  and russia has warned us for that . 
  what is this world after 5 years , who knows . 
  but one thing is sure : russia has shown its eager face again ... 
  in russia putin has managed to gain massive support through economic growth and `` clever '' media ( propaganda ) . 
  and he has been on a power trip after sochi olympics and possibly power drunk from the massive wealth he has `` gained '' from gazprom ( estimated 45billion $ 's but some say even 120 ... ) . 
  russia is in reality ruled by a council of oligarchs , siloviks . 
  and if we look at the eurasian union , all the leaders are oligarch-dictators ( belarus , kazakhstan etc. ) . 
  a bunch of mafia bosses . 
  le pen keeps giving and giving ... 
   simple : you do n't have to go to russia , china or north korea to find a dictatorship belarus ? 
  but seriously , is poland as corrupted as ukraine was ? 
  is there tensions between `` pro-eu '' and `` anti-eu '' people ? 
  it is good to watch over politicians and bankers all over the planet and bark them to hell . 
  if the barking is not true , shame to the dog , otherwise ... make the shitty rulers run ( see : yanukovych ) . 
  sweden was also seriously planning to have its own nuclear bomb in the 1950 's . 
  eventually they scrapped that project ... * ... or did they / s *, 
  it 's the french mistral helo-carrier that 's the most shitty one . 
  and the only one imo that we should be worried about . 
  however , i 'm sure that the french will be forced to make some backdoors etc. 
  that the ship will be impotent sitting duck when needed . 
  * ( that ship deal was made because russian shipbuilding sucks . 
  it 's so corrupted and old fashioned industry that putin wanted to kick some ass in russia by ordering this ship from france . 
  it also tells a lot about the `` super-powerness '' of russia : it ca n't even build it 's own war ships ... ) *, 
  i 've been following this ukraine situation for 7 months now and one of the main `` whattaboutism '' the pro-russians have had here in reddit is `` yeah , but whattabout usa and iraq , afghanistan ... '' also the russian media is 90 % in the kremlin 's hands . 
  and putin just announced laws that are turning russia back to soviet era , ie . 
  it is not allowed to publicly write about war crimes of the soviet troops etc. 
  those books are not result of `` free media '' , those are clearly made by and with the blessings of putinograditsky ... 
  no you ca n't . 
  in your first post up there you try to compare propaganda to politics and brought out iraq in comparison to those russian anti-ukraine stuff . 
  to justify those blatant and na\u00eeve russian books with anti-ukraine shit ? 
  the more you use that kinda arguing the more we finns want to get to nato . 
  and sweden too . 
  you are shooting mama rossija to her foot with that kinda stupidness . 
  yes . 
  he is a minister for only a year , the finnish parliament elections are next fall ( 2015 ) . 
  they chose him because he is popular in twitter and some ( social-media ) , they probably think he can lead kokoomus party to a win in those elections . 
  his hands are tight in the governments decisions and ca n't really do any big changes . 
  actually this is the start of the national coalition party 's election campaign to the 2015 elections . 
  that referee was a moron . 
  actually finland was not `` neutral '' after the ww2 , it was under moscow sphere of influence . 
  finland and ussr had [ the agreement of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance , also known as the yya treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) . 
  finns had the feeling of freedom but were `` forced '' to have ussr military hardware , not to have military training against ussr ( the enemy was a2 `` yellow '' who came always from the west ) etc. 
  also our export business was 70 % to the east . 
  we were heavily under ussr . 
  but they let us to play `` freedom '' because finland was a gateway for ussr spies , secret co-operation channels , test bed for ideas , propaganda and other shit etc. 
  helsinki was the spy capital in the world for ussr and usa and others . 
  with vienna , austria . 
  sweden was clearly `` pro-usa '' that time . 
  when finland government was too afraid to announce the high radioactive cloud from chernobyl accident 1986 ( because ussr was shut up ) , we heard it from the sweds first . 
  they did n't lick the moscow balls like finns did at that time . 
  we kinda had to , we lost land , blood and stuff to ussr in ww2 , but we did n't had the warsaw pact countries destiny ( thank perkele !, 
  for that !, 
  lavrov is a dick . 
  he can go back to moscow sniffing old putins * huilo * . 
  yes , i 'm a finn . 
  russkies do n't say what we do . 
  russian troll . 
  ignore . 
  btw , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_russian_military_intervention_in_ukraine http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26644082, 
  you are quoting out of your ass ... 
  surstr\u00f6mming ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vel6ey8gdc, 
  talking about integrating failures ... ussr . 
  russia ( the hard core of ussr ) failed to integrate many , many things and nations . 
  stalin tried to move out millions and locate them to ie . 
  siberia , far east etc. 
  he tried to get rid off people in gulags , extermination camps etc.
