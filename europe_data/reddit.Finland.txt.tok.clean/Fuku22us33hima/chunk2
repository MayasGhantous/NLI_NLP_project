  you see , if the jews would have stood up against holocaust and get 1 nazi knocked out for each 50 jews they knocked out , there would never have been ww2 . 
  think about it . 
  israel has thought about it , hard . 
  and they are now a nation that nobody wants to attack . 
  it 's quite opposite actually . 
  well , i 'm glad that we got these : http://i.imgur.com/ckajsuh.jpg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rbs-15, 
  ah , the mister thunder ... , 
  you mean * \u00e4ij\u00e4 * ? 
  ah , ok i was wondering that you mean the news ... 
  thanks for clarifying !, 
  umh ... who is calling people here shills ? 
  people are quite precise here about the titles ... , 
  you have any idea how serious this situation is ? 
  * `` have n't ya heard , it 's the battle of words ! '', 
  the poster carrier said . 
  * if you have n't been following , russia and ukraine are in war with each other . 
  and finland is in the economic war with russia with eu and usa . 
  and that russia has captured estonian police officer on estonian clay . 
  and that in latvia :  police raid homes of latvians connected to pro russia rebels in ukraine , weapons found http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/35542/#.vbqaq2p5msp  kyberturva-asiantuntija limn\u00e9ll : `` suomi on hybridisodank\u00e4ynnin kohteena -- t\u00e4t\u00e4 ei pid\u00e4 hyssytell\u00e4 '' http://yle.fi/uutiset/kyberturva-asiantuntija_limnell_suomi_on_hybridisodankaynnin_kohteena__tata_ei_pida_hyssytella/7371020 you need to seriously wake up my friend ... 
  how nice . 
  and meanwhile they are praised in russian media as a nation that is on putin 's side in this ukraine conflict . 
  here 's some gay stamps , that will show ya !, 
  seriously , finland is draining its credibility fast in this harshening europe - russia conflict . 
   alafuzoff gave broadcasting interview with told me that ukraine was not the russian soldiers or citizens , and russian forces were not involved in the conflict . 
  russia mm . 
  rossijskaja gazeta journalist praised after alafuzoff view . 
  brussels was certain that the broadcasting on time of the interview alafuzoff knew that eastern ukraine were on the move the same russian army special forces than a couple of weeks earlier in the crimea . 
  as a result , the eu high representative catherine ashton took alafuzoff statements for review . 
  [ 11 ] also :  eu military intelligence chief rules out russia 's involvement in eastern ukraine events http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_04_15/eu-military-intelligence-chief-rules-out-russia-s-involvement-in-ukraine-events-1955/ and lots of other stuff . 
  he said in a finnish newspaper on may that `` he understands the russian needs to protect russian speaking population over its borders '' he has studied in the highest russian military academy 1997-99 and was one of the primus students . 
  he is also russian orthodox and gave very pro-russian statements ie . 
  in the estonian bronze statue incident . 
   in the meantime , the eu , led by germany , has to deal with russia and ukraine . 
  when it comes to developing a long-term eu strategy toward europe 's east , merkel will need much support from poland and france to make the region stable and democratic . 
  as for putin 's russia , whatever the outcome of the ukraine crisis , moscow has turned away from the west for the moment . 
  that makes the future of eastern europe more urgent than ever . 
  the last chapter . 
  this is a step to the right direction . 
  imo east-europe can and should act like they need to : as nato members start to react and show unity . 
  and drag finland into that actions . 
  finland would need strong support when they are going to apply full membership . 
  now it looks `` not so good '' as some politicians are opposing stronger sanctions , but that 's an economical response . 
  not that we are militarily scared but that a sudden nato membership could lead to major economical disaster and that 's what we need to handle first . 
  i understand that but i hate how our leadership has managed to make us look like putins puppets , the russian media is writing utter propaganda about how finland is `` with their side '' etc. 
  when the truth is not that . 
  that 's also a part of their strategy : to divide eu . 
  the germany is still so beaten and humiliated from the ww2 , they hear the hitler jokes and israel keeps up the holocaust everyday so that they are seriously paralysed to touch `` anti-russian '' talks or discuss about military involvement . 
  i think it 's time to stop humiliating germany and forgive their sins . 
  after all it was over 70 years ago . 
  but meanwhile , lets ie . 
  uk take military lead or poland or nato . 
  it is defence what we are talking about . 
  let germany handle other aspects like economy . 
  europe needs now team work more than ever . 
  do we really let an country with an economy size of italy to bully us with gas ? 
  do we really believe that the same country with population slightly bigger than poland and ukraine together to threat us with expansionism ? 
  yes , that 's russia i 'm talking about . 
  one thing the x-warsaw pact countries ( ussr satellites ) should learn is that it is not about a `` choice between usa or russia '' . 
  this song is way wrong and idiotic . 
  it just shows that the russian propaganda is working : they have from the start blamed usa for the ukraine people revolt against corruption and yanukovych . 
  this makes me kinda sad , that are some people ready to go to this game of `` gibe me more money , i 'll talk rossija if not '' . 
  russia is an economy size of italy . 
  are you saying finland is such an coward that lets an economy size of italy to say how it can defend itself ? 
  the german road in this ukraine crises is making them look really bad . 
  they are heavily traumatized . 
  seems like finland is too . 
  and do n't be so na\u00efve , the world wo n't go over ww3 for finland . 
  i 'm starting to think that finland is like `` peura valoissa '' ( a deer standing frozen in the lights of an car driving towards it ) ... 
  they already hurt our economy . 
  russia is the biggest threat to finland and that include the military . 
  slovakia gets over 90 % of its energy from russia . 
  it is in nato . 
   kanerva : finland 's number one goal was to delay sanctions http://yle.fi/uutiset/kanerva_finlands_number_one_goal_was_to_delay_sanctions/7460100 it 's way over 1000km . 
  you think the other countries sharing a border did a wrong decision to join nato ? 
  you really think finland as a 5 million people nation can cover that border when ukraine with 45 million is in big trouble against russia ? 
  and you think russia looks at finland as a `` neutral '' country ? 
  finland is a perfect target to russia in few next years . 
  first they try with money and economics . 
  if that wo n't work , then military . 
  their new russian empire idea needs expansion and finns are on the target list :  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics we are doing a massive fail here right now . 
  we are turning our backs to nato and europe . 
  and they wo n't care , they 'll just let russia do whatever it wants with finland after these developments . 
  russia is using already finland in their `` propaganda '' . 
  i posted this that we could have a discussion of this development . 
  but that news is basically true . 
  and that is the worrying part : what the fuck is finland doing ? 
  comedy gold . 
  doing the propaganda and misguiding job in europe . 
  ignore both , breivik and rt. 
  uk , you are awesome !, 
  buying time to regroup . 
  ukraine was n't ready to fight against russia , the ato operation would have been success without russian military driving in . 
  it 's a whole new situation . 
  russia wo n't stop , it wants more : a land route to crimea and the `` novorossiya '' project is still going on . 
  this is a slow invasion using grey methods and propaganda , information warfare etc. 
  russia is trying to look `` smart '' and they are using very aggressive propaganda at the home front trying to convince that nato is going to invade russia . 
  russia has to be stopped . 
  whatever ...
