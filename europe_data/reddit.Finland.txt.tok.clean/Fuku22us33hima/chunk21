  finnish ex prime minister paavo lipponen said that he ( halla-aho ) is a dangerous man to finland . 
  do n't know what he meant actually because paavo lipponen is working for gazprom ( also ) . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  on film , filmed ... oh yeah , right . 
  have you heard of digital cameras and iphones , old natsipersusika ? 
  yeah , but this neigbouring country is russia and the rebellions in ukraine and the russians from russia wants to annex those parts to it self . 
  in a civil war people fight for the countries central power . 
  just look at crimea . 
  no it is not . 
  it is russia annexing parts of ukraine using ethnic-russians in ukraine . 
  he is trying to disguise it as a `` civil war '' but is in reality the other opponent . 
  there are hundreds of russians ( passport ) fighting against ukraine government . 
  that is not a civil war . 
  this is much more . 
  it depends very much about the unit you will get assigned . 
  just a question , does the russians in estonia have to do military service ? 
  yep . 
  and they both are nato countries , supposed to co-operate and fight against possible common threat ... 
  she was brave to show to the media ( there were other cameras too ) that how the pro-russians behave . 
  just by showing ukraine passport these `` polite '' people were ready to kill her . 
  so who is the aggressor in this ukraine thing ? 
  not anymore . 
  and there is eurasian union and the cis countries . 
  also russia - china pact ( they have had join military rehearsals ) . 
  all your examples are possible for the russia too . 
  they just call it different : russian mafia . 
  and it 's working great all over the world . 
  and since you are from england , tell me , how many people have died in those cia operations , comparing to ie . 
  radical muslims hits ? 
  i know that there is tons of russian oligarchy money in london and that britain has a lot of business interests with moscow , like nuclear reactors , oil and gas drilling plans in northern sea . 
  and what about mi5 ? 
  british special troops in afghanistan and all over the world ? 
  you 've better to make up your decision who are your friends before it 's too late . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uepfmetmie8  russia today - ukip nigel farage , ** eu no better than a banana republic ** - feb , 2013 * ... so that 's where you get the `` banana republic '' ... *, 
  also we have this ` asterix and obelix ' comic thing , which is clearly an analog to finland - ussr/russia thing . 
  a good one though ... , 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09jhegkyd-m http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm9rbdcz3vc both links are from rt. 
  it is a kremlin ( russian government ) channel spouting heavy sh ... stuff . 
  http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141067/mitchell-a-orenstein/putins-western-allies http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ames-europes-far-right-is-embracing-putin-2014-4 other links as well . 
  what comes to greece , do n't know are they using more the `` orthodoxy '' or the golden dawn ... 
   president vladimir putin praises good relations between russia and france citing nuclear energy and aviation as specific fields in which the two countries are working effectively together . 
  http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_11_01/russia-has-good-relations-with-france-putin-8686/ ...  nigel farage has named vladimir putin as the world leader he most admires . 
  he praised the russian president 's skills as an `` operator '' , citing his `` brilliant '' handling of the civil war in syria . 
  they are voting . 
  and i respect more a vote for the unicorn or james bond than a vote for a racist , neo-nazi party . 
  and since you 're from usa , it 's funny that you take some minor shit from europe as `` shameful '' ... , 
  you are over-reacting to some peoples sense of humour ... 
  the more concerning thing was the rise of anti-eu parties . 
  true . 
  russia has been lobbying hard in uk and france and here is the result , le pen and ukip gain seats and are trying to destroy the eu . 
  putin won . 
  i believe this kinda things happens in every country though ... 
  oh , c'mon relax ... it was 0.6 % out of 100 % that did this joking . 
  and they have the right to do so . 
  this is n't north-korea ... , 
  of course they care . 
  and now we should care more than ever . 
  small countries should form alliances and group behind valuable questions . 
  just like in swedish parliament happens and slovakian parliament . 
  that one fucking ukip shit can easily be isolated and same goes to the french nazi-frogs . 
  you sound just like a loser whining instead of working ... why eat food because you 'll die anyway ...  look ukraine . 
  that 's what happens when you do n't care . 
  there 's always something with ak47 waiting to bring you some caring if you do n't care yourself . 
  and this voting result was shit from france and britain : that 's how they feel about the eu right now . 
  now it 's time to see what 's wrong and make this thing working better . 
  otherwise we all lose and big time . 
  no , it 's real democracy . 
  some people also used it as a `` protest '' vote , because those votes are also counted and taken as a `` protest '' vote . 
  then there are those who do n't vote at all . 
  i find this actually funny !, 
   0,6 % of the votes were rejected this year in the eu-referendum in finland . 
  he can be married also . 
  or divorced . 
  well , you 're right . 
  but at this time schedule is there better option ? 
  it 's up to ukrainian people to demand him start the changes ( with the aid of eu and other organizations ) . 
  i 've heard that he has promised to fight against corruption and other shit but it is of course a hard road . 
  the change has started , the maidan was about that . 
  if he does n't start the changes , people will go to maidan again . 
  and putin drives his tanks to the border ... wait , they are still at the border ... 
  pro-european chocolate king !, 
  sounds perfect to me !, 
  comparing to the previous one ... * ps . 
  why start calling him a possibly opportunist ? 
  ai n't that the case in every f \u00b4 kin leader today ? 
  poroshenko has good relations to russia also and could be a bridge builder between east and west ukraine . 
  that 's exactly what ukraine needs now . 
  hurray !, 
  coffee shops will be saved !, 
   united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  [ 1 ] that quote is from a russian new geopolitical `` bible '' :  the foundations of geopolitics : the geopolitical future of russia is a geopolitical book by alexander dugin . 
  the book has had a large influence within the russian military , police , and statist foreign policy elites [ 1 ] and is used as a textbook in the general staff academy of russian military . 
  [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics have any idea if ukip is doing the `` devils '' work in britain ? 
  like le pen in france ? 
  is there a list somewhere of `` pro-russian '' european politicians ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  we ai n't gona buy anything french for a long time . 
  the last big deal is still not ready and working : the nuclear reactor and plant olkiluoto 3 , which is over 6 years late and done so badly that it will not even get a permission to start up ( read : blow up ) . 
  no wonder germany just walked in france in 1939 ... 
  fuck you france .
