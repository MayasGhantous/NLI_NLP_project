  because of this deal , my country finland , has to make new weapon deals and beef up military . 
  ca n't you see that you are dancing with the devil ? 
  in finland there is a saying '' * ryss\u00e4 on ryss\u00e4 vaikka voissa paistais !, 
  * '' meaning `` russkie is a russkie even if you fry it in butter ( in the pan ) ! '' . 
  it 's been the same for centuries , it has n't change . 
  the russian/soviet mentally is ruled by fist , they have a almost fatalistic `` islamist '' kinda attitude to religion ( orthodox ) , they are isolated behind different vocabulary , they are blinded by the vast size of their country ( compare population : russia 110million / europe 550million ) . 
  and they still want to annex more land . 
  for what , do they need more `` lebensraum '' ? 
  they ca n't even populate their own emptiness , they barely can keep their population on the growth ... also the lack of empathy ( towards their neighbors or even themselves ) , arrogance and almost paranoid suspicioness against everything what 's `` outside there '' of russia is and was heavily crippling the development of their society . 
  and that is a class-society . 
  putin is from soviet era and is a kgb colonel who was brainwashed ( or `` trained '' ) to the `` evil west '' narrative . 
  he was also a `` andropovitsky '' ( kgb leader who became the soviet leader in 1980 's ) who was paranoidic and almost started the nuclear holocaust . 
  putin was also a undercover agent in east-germany and knows the skills of disguising his attitude etc. 
  but it 's revealed now ( see : crimea ) . 
  he knows also very well how to brainwash his own people and uses this russian imperialism , orthodoxy and bolshevism ( nostalgia ) as a storyboard of `` great russia '' . 
  it is easy to keep the average russian who does n't speak english ( or any other language ) and is locked behind the different alphabets , under the government media ( which holds 90 % of the information ) . 
  i never thought i would see this day come . 
  but it seems like the history is repeating itself , at least in russia . 
  they say that russia is a bear . 
  you ca n't beat it by yourself . 
  but you know bees ? 
  bears fear them . 
  that 's the way we can keep it behind it 's borders . 
  we , european countries are the bees . 
  we can swarm that narrow minded honey-robber quite easily , if we want to . 
  and i think that we have to act now . 
  the new laws putin has ordered are just the beginning of a new horrible regime that can launch ww3 just because they get kicks out of it . 
  the russian mirror is blind . 
  ... and young . 
  ( zhirinovsky is 68 and putin 63 ) . 
  zhirinovsky also attacked a pregnant journalist during a press conference telling an aide to `` rape the woman hard '' . 
  just weeks ago : http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-zhirinovsky-tells-aides-rape-3438539 such polite people . 
  lol i can imagine what goes inside an average russian heterosexual mens mind tonight when he is spinning around in his bed having heavy hangover nightmares from victory day drinking and eurovision contest ... http://i.imgur.com/2boneh3.jpg, 
  putin : back up our tanks 1 meter . 
  good , now lets call angela ... / s, 
  here is also something awkward russian new literature : http://i.imgur.com/wsq6k4i.jpg http://i.imgur.com/xdze81i.jpg tovaritsh hitler by german romanov . 
  http://www.amazon.co.uk/tovarisch-gitler-kniga-povesit-cherchillya/dp/5995505483 ... also on amazon . 
  well , you are most probably right , the siege was a horrible and a unhuman act . 
  just that i remembered that hitler 's banquet story ( i heard it from a soviet travel agent in that hotel astoria , yes , i 've been there in 1980 's ) . 
  never again !, 
  thank you for robbing my parents land and fortune , fields and home : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelia passibo ylen sankia ... 
  no , he did n't :  adolf hitler reportedly planned to hold a victory banquet in the hotel 's [ astoria ] winter garden . 
  he was so convinced leningrad would fall quickly that invitations to the event were printed in advance . 
  [ 8 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotel_astoria_%28saint_petersburg%29, 
   reports detail the russian tactic known as `` half-open procurement , '' which is used alongside more traditional double agents . 
  the tactic sees members of the russian foreign intelligence services , who claim to work at the russian embassy , befriend their targets and then arrange regular meetings with them in order to tap them for information about germany . 
  according to welt am sonntag , russian targets can include scientists , ngo employees , as well as politicians and members of the bundestag and their employees . 
  exactly what ussr did during the cold war in finland . 
  we even had a name to those people `` koti-ryss\u00e4 '' ( home-russkie ) . 
  during the cold war , finnish capital helsinki was one of the most busiest `` spy-central '' with austrian vienna . 
  wrong , europe day is 9th may : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day, 
  it is europe day here in the eu : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day, 
  not really . 
  it 's kinda distorted picture because the eu elections are going on and the eu-critic side ( related to far-right ) is little bit stronger because of the economic depression what 's going on . 
  i believe that after the elections situation is going to stabilize and thanks to putin and his latest actions , the eu and nato will be able to concentrate on the union better . 
  that 's why european leaders are kinda paralyzed at the moment , but just wait for couple of weeks . 
   igor vsevolodovich girkin ( born 17 december 1970 ) [ 1 ] also known as strelkov ( meaning the gunman ) is the commander of the donbass people 's militia paramilitary group , and the key figure behind the 2014 pro-russian unrest in ukraine . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] according to ukrainian and eu authorities , girkin is a russian military intelligence colonel who participated in the 2014 crimea crisis . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] he is currently sanctioned by the european union for his leading role in the insurgency in eastern ukraine . 
  [ 6 ] russia denies any interference in ukraine by its troops outside crimea ; [ 2 ] ukraine has released intercepted telephone conversations between strelkov and supposed handlers in moscow . 
  [ 4 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/igor_strelkov_%28gru%29 some sources says that his rank in russia is a general ( reserve ) . 
  but yes , it is confirmed from many sources that he is russian military . 
  and was already in action during the crimea operation and got from there to slovjansk/east-ukraine . 
  and he is not the only one . 
  did n't putin just said that russia is no more europe ( or gayrope as they say on the streets of russia ... ) ? 
  yep . 
  first they label you as a `` fascist '' . 
  when you debunk that , they say you are a `` russo-phobic '' , when you debunk that they go full ad hominem ... 
  and north korea . 
  probably . 
  but does putin wait over the victory day ( 9th of may ) which is a huge fiesta in russia ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/a4es86w.jpg ( pict from victory day parade at red square ), 
  true . 
  eu ca n't never trust putin again . 
  he stabbed us in the belly right after olympics and made himself look like a thug in the eyes of the world . 
  yes , i forget many of them ...  before the 1991 dissolution of the soviet union , researchers who attempted to count the number of people killed under stalin 's regime produced estimates ranging from 3 to 60 million . 
  [ 101 ] after the soviet union dissolved , evidence from the soviet archives also became available , containing official records of 799,455 executions 1921 -- 53 , [ 102 ] around 1.7 million deaths in the gulag and some 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement -- with a total of about 2.9 million officially recorded victims in these categories . 
  [ 103 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#calculating_the_number_of_victims he killed people where ever he could , here is poland , katyn : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/katyn_massacre_5.jpg also very worrying is that ...  results of a controversial poll taken in 2006 stated that ** over 35 % of russians would vote for stalin ** if he were still alive . 
  [ 313 ] [ 314 ] fewer than a third of all russians regarded stalin as a `` murderous tyrant '' ; [ 8 ] however , a russian court in 2009 , ruling on a suit by stalin 's grandson , yevgeny dzhugashvili , against the newspaper , novaya gazeta , ruled that referring to stalin as a `` bloodthirsty cannibal '' was not libel . 
  [ 315 ] in a july 2007 poll ** 54 % of the russian youth agreed that stalin did more good than bad ** while 46 % ( of them ) disagreed that stalin was a `` cruel tyrant '' . 
  half of the respondents , aged from 16 to 19 , agreed stalin was a wise leader . 
  [ 9 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#views_on_stalin_in_the_russian_federation lenin , stalin , putin ... 
  they are carrying pictures of butchers whom have killed over 20 million russians . 
  and numerous other nationalities . 
  are they serious ? 
  do they know what they are doing ? 
   the maidan protesters were heroes , but the true fight -- the fight for what the new ukraine will be -- begins now , and it will be much tougher than the fight against putin 's intervention . 
  a new and riskier heroism will be needed . 
  it has been shown already by those russians who oppose the nationalist passion of their own country and denounce it as a tool of power . 
  it 's time for the basic solidarity of ukrainians and russians to be asserted , and the very terms of the conflict rejected . 
  the next step is a public display of fraternity , with organisational networks established between ukrainian political activists and the russian opposition to putin 's regime . 
  this may sound utopian , but it is only such thinking that can confer on the protests a truly emancipatory dimension . 
  otherwise , we will be left with a conflict of nationalist passions manipulated by oligarchs . 
  such geopolitical games are of no interest whatever to authentic emancipatory politics . 
  the last chapter of that interesting writing . 
  no , its because he knows no better . 
  he is 63-years old , x-kgb colonel who is using the ussr-era politics and propaganda because that 's what he knows best . 
  and he has brainwashed russians for years to this new russian imperialism . 
  he has also infiltrated social-media sites outside russia with shills , far-righters etc. 
  to do the bashing .
