  in fact europe and usa are seeing day by day a possible scenario that china and russia will go together and that they have only each others . 
  and of course the polite canadians . .  most of the putins propaganda is aimed to russia and russians . 
  ah , mr. berluscone , the same italian who is deeply in love with the russian `` silvio '' mr. putin ... ? 
  http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01772/putin_1772946b.jpg berluscone has backed up vladimir putin many times . 
  and this sounds once again that he is doing what vlad says . 
  i am 100 % sure that silvio berluscone and vladimir putin have made some very suspicious and murky money-related arrangements between themselves and by looking both mens wealthy ( hundreds of billions $ 's ) and history , i would say that they might be the two biggest mafia-bosses alive ... want to read some more ? 
   mr berlusconi has been friends with former kgb agent mr putin , for more than five years and the two have held numerous bilateral meetings as well as entertained each other on holiday . 
   of concern to washington was said to be the deal between italian energy firm eni and russian gas giant gazprom , over the south stream pipeline as well as the `` very cordial relationship between mr putin and mr berlusconi '' . 
  london is a very popular city among younger people here in finland . 
  the love to go there , some go to see imho the best football in europe , girls want fashion , shopping , getting pissed ... 
  the older like britain also : the most watched tv-programs are emmerdale and other brit series ( have been running years ) . 
  most generally quite positive feelings . 
  do n't forget that crimea is now an island for russia . 
  they might want to have east-ukraine , which is right above crimea , to have land routes and securing the north of crimea . 
  ukrainians should start to send them bottled water through russian mail and cause a logistic mayhem for russia ... :d, 
  ah , ok , no problem !, 
  putin would love that idea and would gladly accept ukip 's referendum to join russia asap . 
  armenia has been very active lately . 
  here is a thread about armenian military in militaryphotos.net : http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?155169-the-armed-forces-of-armenia-official-thread/page288 they have been showing a lot of stuff , also from the russian military bases there , yes , there is a lot of russian military there : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_armenia#russia  russia is armenia 's closest ally . 
  the russian 102nd military base , the former 127th motor rifle division , is stationed in gyumri . 
  the military alliance of the two nations and , in particular , the presence of russian troops on armenian soil has been a key element of armenia 's national security doctrine since armenia gained independence in 1991 . 
  thanks !, 
  this is a great relief . 
  i found a book from russia : http://i.imgur.com/wsq6k4i.jpg german romanov : tovaritsh fuehrer . 
  i do n't know is this translated to other languages and does the far-righters know this . 
  but it is odd . 
  it has even a sequel ( or part two ) : http://i.imgur.com/xdze81i.jpg tovaritsh hitler . 
  ** finland ** only few individuals can be labelled as `` far-right '' or `` neo-nazies '' . 
  the populist party `` true finns '' have some elements but they are marginal and some of them have been kicked out of the party . 
  also the party leader timo soini has condemned them . 
  and that is good . 
  we have no problems to handle them . 
  so russia is funding jobbik , who is trying to get hungary out of eu ? 
  what would nato think of that ? 
  and the rest of the eu ? 
  just look at maidan . 
  the seeds for something similar have been planted inside hungary . 
  why ? 
  does hungary want to get back to the ussr ... ? 
  you need to do something about it . 
  seriously . 
  what eve ' . 
  the guy is the same guy in both pictures , did he by his gear from walmart or not . 
  you are just derailing this shit here . 
  average income in ukraine is 240 $ per month . 
  that weapon and two scopes would cost ~ 2250 $ 's . 
  plus the other gears , let 's say 500 $ 's . 
  that is 2750 $ 's . 
  it 's a years salary for a ukrainian . 
  or two weeks , if you are in norway . 
  north korea ? 
  i 've tried to follow that mans mind and read his books , but he is lost in a weird world of besserwisserism , bad jokes and narcissism . 
  not that he has bring out some good points and subjects , but he is still so far away ( intellectually ) from the common man ( i mean people got to understand what he means ) that i do n't really see much logic in his actions . 
  except the attention and $ thing ... 
  how many sleeping agents did germany get when the east and west germany united again ? 
  as we know , russian president v.putin was a kgb-agent in east-germany . 
   kgb stationed putin in dresden , east germany . 
  [ 31 ] during that time , putin was assigned to directorate s , the illegal intelligence-gathering unit ( the kgb 's classification for agents who used falsified identities ) where he was given cover as a translator and interpreter . 
  [ 32 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_putin#kgb_career so putin knows how to tickle germany 's balls ? 
  or is this because germany gets so much business with russia ? 
  or is it ww2 syndrome ? 
  or is this just like before ww2 , germany and russia playing friends and then ... ? 
  anyhow , i understand that germany is not the optional leader here against russia . 
  it just gives too much opportunities to russia . 
  if we need to pressure russia more , i think we can do it from a very surprising way ... , 
  just look at the way he holds the rifle , the way he has strapped the pistol holster , which side are magazines , gloves etc. 
  they are the same person in 95 % accuracy . 
  look at the eyes !, 
  also the scope is changeable very easily , picatinny rails , just two klicks and change the scope , one shot ie . 
  to a tree and zero the optics = done . 
  in the first picture he has a optic for long range shooting and in the other a close range holo . 
  different town , different mission . 
  also that weapon is not common in the pictures i 've seen during this ukraine crises . 
  and i 've seen a lot . 
  the devil lays in the details ... there is so much to take care of when you design and launch annexations and other dirty things , that you ca n't take care of everything . 
  there will always pop up something . 
  like this . 
  and knowing that putin is old kgb and that the whole putin 's establishment is from the old soviet era , i can tell you that they were sloppy in propaganda . 
  it was many times so rude and obvious that it made you think that is this meant to be like `` look , i 'm propaganda ! '', 
  ( yes , i 've been in ussr ) . 
  and then you realize that they did n't have the experience of the target-group to make it look like believable . 
  and the you find out that some of the propaganda was made by people ... 
  okay , that 's another story . 
  but that is the same guy in those picts . 
  i 'm 96 % positive . 
  hungary , are you getting closer to putin and what the hell are you playing with jobbik ? 
  do you have a ukraine-syndrome ? 
  the ukraine parliament voted a law considering these kinda situations just before maidan police operations and called them `` anti-terrorist '' things . 
  they are using this same term that yanukovitch used against maidan demonstrators . 
  maybe to show that this is/was a law created by yanukovitch , the `` pro-russian '' x-president . 
  do n't know . 
  wou , that bitch needs to just shut up ... 
  rumors of shooting : special forces sent to retake buildings in eastern ukraine ; pro-russians open fire - @ap, 
  yes , but in this case the `` far-right '' spouters are shooting themselves on the foot , both of them . 
  there is absolutely no way they would gain support because they are `` pro-russians '' or more like pro-putin . 
  and after putin realizes that he will give the another shot . 
  and when russians see that the `` fascists '' support their leader ... 
  trolling , shills and paid provocations . 
  the `` far-right '' or `` neo-nazies '' want to disturb and create revolts . 
  that 's their only way to `` power '' .
