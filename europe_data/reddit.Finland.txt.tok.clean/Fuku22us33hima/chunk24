  how ever the number of these nuts is small and they are mostly angry teenagers who are afraid to go out and therefore they are sitting by their computers and shovel shit to the internet . 
  do n't forget that there is the european parliament elections ( of mp 's ) next month . 
  this may be related to that also . 
  time to put `` neo-nazies '' to the terrorist lists ... 
  a man who does n't know even himself what he wants . 
  except to be in the middle of attention . 
  i 'm quite close to russia too . 
  finland . 
   even finland is not in nato , we will help baltics in a possible crises very much . 
  we are facing the same enemy here . 
  and the dugin has said also that finland should be a part of `` russian empire '' ...  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics, 
  my mistake , i meant to say that baltics ( latvia , lithuania , estonia ) do n't own a single fighter plane : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_air_force http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_air_force http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_air_force and that was imo a clear sign that baltics see nato as a defence union . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  first putin was offering ukraine -33 % cheaper gas and 15-20 billion $ 's loan . 
  and then pours 2 billion in crimea ( the bridge plan ) . 
  then starts to cry that european union must give him money because ukraine did n't like him . 
  what the fuck ? 
  is he serious ? 
  or are the economic sanctions really working ? 
  yes . 
  sweden and finland are moving closer to nato because of this . 
  when they bully ukraine with the `` do n't even think about nato '' argument , it creates pressure in north to join nato . 
  and besides , who are they to tell independent countries what they should do about their defence politics ? 
  and also , baltic nato countries did n't have a single military fighter at their soil before this ukraine thing . 
  now there is three squadrons from other nato countries securing their borders . 
  and polish land forces are ready to back up baltics etc. 
  the snowden-case also is a big factor . 
  people think now that `` russia does n't spy on internet '' and is therefore morally `` stronger '' . 
  also the olympics have still some effects , and nostalgia ( the feeling that everything was better in the past ) ... 
  this needs translation . 
  could some-one please ... ? 
  kazakhstan is already under kremlins thumb . 
  yes . 
  but you forget that nato is n't usa . 
  nato is a coalition and the european members ( 26 countries ) can mobilize over 6.000 k ( 6 million ) soldiers to the possible war . 
  usa can deploy nearly 3.000 k ( 3 million ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_nato#military_personnel usa does n't need to send huge amounts of troops , we europeans can support that . 
  what usa can do is feed ammo and high end military equipment , like stealth missiles and drones etc. 
  russia ca n't do nearly as good as nato . 
  and they know that . 
  and they fear that . 
  that 's why the nuclear weapons are the only `` real '' defense they got . 
  nato is a defense organization . 
  and russia is the aggressive part here . 
  there is no doubt that europeans will take seriously any military action russia does against one of it member and nato country , like estonia . 
  where did you get that date ?? 
  because that piece of news is from :  published time : january 19 , ** 2012 ** 12:32  edited time : january 19 , ** 2012 ** 16:32 ... and your text is from somewhere else . 
  however , how did this rt news jumped suddenly to the top from nowhere ? 
  putin tactics . 
  he sends his troll army to reddit and soon they demand a referendum . 
  then reddit joins russia and becomes banned . 
  russians do think that they are so special that they can fuck the world . 
  they believe that their suffering and history gives them a right to do what they want . 
  endless line of betrayals . 
  and the evil west . 
  always something evil from outside crawls into mother russia and makes it doing things to its people and others . 
  yes , i have a sarcastic tone on my text . 
  btw . 
  russia is also blind . 
  i mean that from inside , from a normal , small countryside village 800k from moscow you do n't have anything else than russia . 
  you can compare this to usa , people deeper inside do n't care about nothing else than usa . 
  but in russia it is not that they would n't like to know , it is just that the barrier is much , much harder to penetrate . 
  first it is language : nobody speaks russia or understands the alphabet outside russia . 
  and they do n't teach languages so much in russian schools . 
  and historically they did n't have a right to travel , even outside their own oblast , until 1990 's . 
  so now that they have had the possibility to travel and see the world , they were disappointed : europe was like a paradise comparing to old soviet u and europe was supposed to `` loose the great war '' ( ww2 ) and therefore it was supposed to be lower than ussr ... russians do n't trust their leaders much . 
  first they love them if they can improve their lives , just like putin did after yeltsin , and that is ok . russians feel that `` democratic '' things are from west ( so was communism  karl marx , btw ) and therefore still evil . 
  like the gay-thing . 
  they do n't want to `` play with western rules '' , they want a new `` rule book '' . 
  they do n't want `` integration '' , they want separation . 
  they feel that they have a right to `` rob a little '' or `` rape a little '' ( just the tip ) after they 've been true , because they have been robbed and raped . 
  and by their own people . 
  just my 5 kopeks ... 
  ** sisu ** a finnish word meaning a mysterious power inside a human . 
  it is close to `` guts '' and `` brave '' but it 's more like `` toughness '' , something what you need to survive a long , cold winter with lack of many things . 
  also forgetting greece from that picture , it has ~ 900 tanks and a lot more stuff : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equipment_of_the_hellenic_army, 
  yeah , sure , sweden and germany are in war ... :d, 
  kremlin has indeed have some skirmishes on the media about finland and children , especially russian or russian-finnish families children . 
  they have tried to scare russians to not move to finland or paint a picture about finland like a `` monstrous '' place for children ( they beat and kill them in finland ) . 
  also russia wo n't let children with dual citizenship ( finnish-russian ) leave russia , if there is divorce or similar shit going on . 
  the main goal has been in the russia 's concern about their population shrinking . 
  if you remember the adoption bans :  putin signs bill that bars u.s. adoptions , upending families http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/world/europe/putin-to-sign-ban-on-us-adoptions-of-russian-children.html?pagewanted=all ... then this has a similar aspect . 
   i do n't think letting them have crimea was the wrong thing to do ( letting them = not starting nuclear war over it ) you think that next time putin goes straight to the business by saying `` give me latvia or i 'll press the nuke button ! '', 
  you know that the nuke button is also a self-destruction button ? 
  if you use it or threat with it , it 's like a suicide . 
  just let the fucker press that button . 
  if he dares . 
  china lives from west . 
  their gdp is growing only because of eu and usa ( trade ) . 
  and so does russia ( gas and oil ) . 
  polish army is over 600.000 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces it has also 1000 tanks . 
  in the military doctrines it 's said that you need a 4:1 over power to attack against the defender . 
  so russia would need 2.5 million soldiers and 4000 tanks ... and russia simply ca n't deploy such an army , they do n't have the equipment nor man power . 
  if they even try , they have to pull troops from other vulnerable areas and their flanks would be open . 
  this is not 1939 . 
  this is not cold war . 
  and russia is nowhere near the soviet union military power . 
  poland can defend very effective and will get the whole nato support .
