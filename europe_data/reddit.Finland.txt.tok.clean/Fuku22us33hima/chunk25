  the nato air-forces alone are 12:1 against russia and much more better in quality . 
  not to mention aa capability , tank quality , motivation etc. 
  only an idiot will think about attacking poland . 
  because poland is strong . 
  an has good friends . 
  nonsense . 
  if nato would n't protect baltics , who are in nato , eu and $ uro , then the whole coalition would collapse . 
  the hungary , romania , slovaks etc. 
  would jump of the wagon and usa would look like a traitor . 
  yes . 
  and why should it ? 
   it 's the power of the media , brainwashing the western society . 
  here in `` west '' we have multiple news sources , independent or not , hosted by russian government ( rt ) or else , local news and freedom of speech , different political parties with their own opinions and news etc. 
  in this environment you just ca n't `` brainwash '' people like you can in ie . 
  russia or other authoritative , censorship countries . 
   but the real victim in this whole mess is russia . 
  oh , please . 
  how many russians had died ? 
  over 100 ukrainians lost their lives in ukraine and now ukraine is in a fear of russian invasion , they already invaded crimea . 
  and the polls say that 82 % of russians are happy ... victims ? 
   they know they 've lost ukraine to the us , ...  but sincerely , they are the victims , us strategists are laughing their asses off , they took russia most important ally and ** made russia break an agreement ** ( notice that russia is not famous for going back on it 's words ) by invading a country , and now the whole world thinks that the `` russians are so bad omg . '', 
   they do n't want to invade anyone . 
  yeah , sure . 
  your logic is nonsense . 
  `` we do n't want to invade but us made us do it ! '', 
  how exactly ? 
  and why `` whole world '' thinks that russians are bad ? 
  could it be that russia/putin backed up mr.yanukovitch who was coming to be a dictator of ukraine and giving the orders to shoot his own people ? 
  that man robbed billions of $ 's and was corrupted as fuck . 
  ukrainians did n't want that and started to demonstrate which turned to revolution . 
  now they are having elections and they are trying to solve their problems in a democratic way . 
  your ranting is just thick shit and lies . 
  africa . 
  poland has a quite formidable army , it can put 415.000 men strong army in two weeks : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces and they know their enemy very well . 
  what i mean here is that poland can fight very effectively against russia and hold on till the other nato troops can arrive . 
  and they will . 
  `` vladimir putin want 's to get shot by simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 '' says a sacked old x-adviser as a provoking test to find out decadent eastern 's public opinion about that ... 
  these kinda comments from russia have been coming every year from ie . 
  zhirinovsky etc. 
  we are used to that . 
  the `` imperial russia '' thinking has increased a little bit in russia and there are russian nazies who spit out all kinda crap about baltic 's , `` slavic brotherhood '' etc. 
  but there is absolutely no such thinking in finland . 
  the more they keep sayin ' things like these , the more they are pushing nato towards st.peterburg . 
  let 's see what 's the talks next week . 
  this is some kinda stress test , russia is poking and trying to see what kinda reactions will come out . 
  and this guy is not a close adviser anymore . 
  and putin has n't said that . 
  so this is just blaablablaa and does n't mean a shit . 
  it was just fire-works to the glorious leader of russia . 
  i remember as a kid during the cold war , that i saw ( and everyone else of course ) many times the smoke trails from nuclear rocket missile tests from the white sea . 
  the cold january ( minus 32 celsius ) morning on a way to school and the sun was barely above the horizon ... and there they were on the sky line , three rockets pushing through ... nukes on the way . 
  we are very aware of russian capabilities and intentions . 
  they also want to show that the arctic region and the vast gas and oil resources are a issue here . 
  but they are shooting themselves on the foot , the new sea route around siberia is now not so thinkable options because of sanctions . 
  although the resources could be a much more bigger issue to kremlin . 
  it is our custom . 
  even in the winter war , finns get their fallen friends from the no-mans land and send them home to burial . 
  aaa, 
  `` this spring rosputitsa very little , almost no , we go three months earlier than last time and achtung , eu is to urals now ! '', 
  this leak is from rt. 
  where did they get it from ? 
  did snowden teach russians some new tricks or do they monitor phone calls like nsa is claimed to do ? 
  this is not the first leaked tape , there was the maidan shooters tape where estonian minister talked about it . 
  that came also from rt. 
  these tapes prove only that russia is capable of listening phone-calls and/or is buying this stuff from other agencies/phone companies . 
  and then using it as a propaganda tool . 
  the one thing they ( putin/fsb ) do n't understand that in europe people hate this kinda surveillance and shit and are capable to see through that . 
  russia is making itself looking much more dirty than nsa . 
  these methods may work in russia . 
  but here this only makes tymoshenko look much better . 
  she might even know that this will happen and used that language to show ukrainians that she is with them and ready to defend her country and people . 
  russia ca n't use its nukes in finland : the radio-activity will transfer to st.peterburg etc. 
  because the winds in high atmosphere goes from west to east in the northern hemisphere . 
  also it will turn baltic sea , which is a very vital sea route , to a unusable route ( oil tankers will be radioactive etc. ) . 
  it will be like using a flame-thrower against the wind . 
  ** here is some numbers from winter war 1939 ** : tanks : finland 32 - soviets ~ 3,500 aircraft : finland 114 - soviets 3,880 manpower : finland 337,000 - soviets ~ 900,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war finns lost land , but stopped the red army and stalin . 
  that war lasted 105 days . 
  comparing military budgets is meaningless , the other country ( russia ) has strategic missile and space troops etc. 
  also corruption takes its share and military budgets do n't do the fighting . 
  also russia is in the middle of its history 's biggest military reform and they are flying with 40 years old ussr planes . 
  finland just bought over 100 leopard 2a6 tanks from holland : [ puolustusvoimat , fdf news ] ( http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/portal/puolustusvoimat.fi/!ut/p/c5/vzhlkqjaeew_zt5aqygebuuhqouhgpiqywoijuipiq2twncpeb2y6mw4msxc3nvzrgacdix93t6rw_zwneftcaxbpmwyulttholmlwqkld82fvnwbwmfqqlwunqevl9yw3ei-bb2ib32hl8-xmj6j1dr46tfyb0u0wbwol3ndjsxhkyh4grc6mnjz9b9c7jr_4yzst80x9vh2hyu8hwhgaw-16hwoysidajhjietdalaiym1kmyii5wnet_apzr8t80gsegg_-whpsexjwnfhigbu0d0wms8z8mvz-nlvcso6eovwdkcqyyzexyipso8by9veiprjf9s5fexfpxslg2ykq-nj109hvnf0jrrvlgekiywwidjutsrq_ugnnh0aeq9kpkzobkohtpjwylptgthytmt9dlpukh5-jo5xsgpmgn58a10_f7sw5b_3nqpznztzowe4le4svxvtz2vry7m2x3biian5-1r_arfmxq6o6olf2pkds2_6to-hjp2mvh17r6dysyz5dvbsf2ig3mjjm5jt6ptmg28zjhnsv7d2gf7y8-ztk2x1rgc97nncubkzdrmggc2dqeu9f1ca3ny_-pi9hdzabd-/dl3/d3/l2dbisevz0fbis9nqseh/?pcid=48fb310042947357bb39bf5746776b01 ) also finland has nato as it neighbor in estonia . 
  if russia wants to attack finns alone , i 'm pretty sure they have to mass troops also against nato borders , because if there is even a little sign of russian troops failing ... 
  but this all is just hypothetical , is n't it ? 
  russia is no where near the soviet union military strength now . 
  they ca n't mass troops against finnish border like they did last time . 
  the attacker needs usually 4:1 over power ( meaning if finns can defend with 6 brigades , russia would need 24 brigades to win ) depending on quality of the troops , tanks etc. 
  and as ciggey said , we can turn this land to a hell for the russian soldiers . 
  and we will . 
  if needed . 
  that would be awesome !, 
  finland and sweden are not nato members , but together they could build up a quite formidable military force . 
  swedish air-force rocks !, 
  finland has two official languages , finnish and sweden . 
  the more languages spoken makes society stronger ( economy , trade , respect etc. ) . 
  i 'm not saying that estonia should make russia a official language , just that it would not be a cultural suicide . 
  the world is changing rapidly , people and business moves free , internet is changing culture more than anything else . 
  we should not play this language question like putin wants . 
  by stirring estonia and the russian speaking population , the russian government is only provoking . 
  it wants to test the nato / usa reactions . 
  keep calm and carry on , you wo n't be left alone !,
