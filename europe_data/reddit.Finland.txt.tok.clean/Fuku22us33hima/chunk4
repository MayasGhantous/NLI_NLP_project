  why dear merkel and germany you do n't wan na share some of love instead cold hard east-germanic steely `` rationalische politcsh '' ? 
  because dear merkel , i suppose you know what the russian mental and culture is ... 
  if you think the baltic gas pipe is a safe route instead of ukraine one ... when conflicts spread , so does terror and other shit . 
  russia needs to be stopped now . 
  gently but strong . 
  together . 
  getting tired of your shit hungary ... 
  this is all bad journalism . 
  and bad propaganda from our ( finnish ) government also . 
  yes , i 'm a finn here in finland . 
  1 . finns are not thanking putin . 
  they are cursing him . 
  2 . finns dairy industries are going to get a major blow because of these sanctions , estimated from 300 - 400 million $ 's . 
  3 . finland is not flooded with those cheese . 
  there are only few markets that can sell those products . 
  it is , yes , a clever marketing shit . 
  it is only making people angry because only those who have a car and live in big cities are going to get those cheaper products . 
  ( car markets can sell those ) . 
  4 . those who are going to thank putin are the russian consumers who go shopping over the border . 
  there is already a huge traffic of single persons filled in wagons who are travelling back and forth over the border taking these cheese to russia 2kg at the time . 
  well , ferguson is trending a lot on #russia and novorossiya people are making already propaganda picts calling ferguson as a blacknovorossiya . 
  so it is just a tool of russian propaganada to divide and stir up shit again : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bveuqnkigaagvzw.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bve2rpzcyaaxano.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bvfbvgrceaiflib.jpg etc. 
  #newfergusonslogan on twitter, 
  well , the food is the side show actually . 
  the media pr is the main goal here . 
  and lifting up spirit in ukraine and europe . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  just tobakko but yes , good notice on that sleep thing ...  okay , i 'll go to bed now . 
  does anybody understand what kinda pr opportunity this is after the russian humanitarian aid - campaign ? 
  there is a already huge empty lorry in the media consumers brains at the moment ( i 'm meaning that it will break to the news stream and peoples heads like bang ! ), 
  also who says that we need to `` destroy '' ukraine farming industry ? 
  it will be only a 300 truck column filled with norwegian smoked salmon , finnish cheese , estonian chocolate , polish kielbasa , latvian smetana , lituanian , cream , italian pasta , french champagne etc. 
  and on the way back we can fill those lorries with ukraine beer and vodka and send one of those lorries to 300 cities around europe and free beer and vodka festival !, 
  with fireworks !, 
  lets paint those lorries pink and have live media coverage from that column all over the globe . 
  live cams from inside , all that shit . 
  celebrities travelling with it , having a concert at the target towns lugansk and donetsk !, 
  okay , maybe not pink . 
  how about light yellow with a blue star ? 
  the idea is to support ukraine . 
  and to show russia that we can function . 
  that the russian policy in europe wo n't work ( they are trying to separate unity with ie . 
  people like le pen , ukip etc. ) . 
  that we do n't lie . 
  that the people in ukraine can believe in us . 
  the value of this kinda pr and media action could be easily ten or hundred millions . 
  think about the marketing effects in asia , usa etc. 
  when they see european quality food being sooo goood and tasty , the freedom food and aid truck-lorry goddamn europeans taking all the media coverage and having free beer and vodka festivals ... the effect could be snowballing !, 
  do n't be so goddamn cynical and whining . 
  if you do n't care about ukraine and what 's going on there , the next is that you 're going to pay more and more for it . 
  and as we have seen , our economy is going to recession for this . 
  it means lost jobs and other shit . 
  rather pour water to the flames of war than oil . 
  what humanitarian ? 
  the trucks are barely having few sacks of old wheat ... and more military vehicles have crossed the borders than any trucks . 
  remember crimea . 
  do n't be fooled again . 
  when you are in the middle , you have to fight all the ways . 
  it is a miracle that we are still alive after ww2 . 
  you know that we fighted ussr twice and germany once ? 
  and after that still get butt fucked by russia for decades ? 
  this time we really are and have to be on one firm side . 
  there is `` no middle '' . 
  never was , ever gona be . 
  pavel gubarev says that strelkov ( igor ivanovich ) is replaced with another guy , whose name also happens to be strelkov : http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2dlmre/pavel_gubarev_about_resignation_of_strelkov/ just making things more blurry they are . 
  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bu6ksrnceaanwu-.jpg:lar the convoy described in one picture . 
  haaga . 
  never been in russia ? 
  he gave a special tv-announcement about this visit . 
  he did n't say much . 
  talked something about peace and ukraine and that he was invited by putin already last summer . 
  but the body language ... oh boy . 
  he 's not a master of that art , that 's for sure . 
  even his secretary was more manly than him . 
  he was obviously hiding something much bigger and scared . 
  what a leader , must say ... 
  while it is too early to make any consumptions ( could be even that putin demands to meet him ) , let 's see what they have to say . 
  this can be anything . 
  even an ultimatum to finland . 
  or a peace offer between poroshenko and putin . 
  let 's see what this day brings ... 
  there was some polls month ago were there putin support was high ( ~ 80 % ? ), 
  but there support for a war against ukraine was something like 40 % . 
  if i remember correctly . 
  also parts of buk missile system are travelling with the convoy : https://twitter.com/courtneymoscow/status/499871131915264000 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bu_mi9jimaavsx9.jpg that 's the command post vechile : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/buk-m1-2_air_defence_system_in_2010.jpg/800px-buk-m1-2_air_defence_system_in_2010.jpg the vechile on the left . 
  you should visit the / russia and see how they are `` discussing '' ... information war . 
  whining about it ? 
  irrelevant . 
  just skip the shit . 
  do you understand that there is a war going on europe right now ? 
  and that it is russia that is pushing itself to ukraine ? 
  and that everyone is going to recession because of the economic war ( sanctions ) ? 
  and that there is a information war raging on , also here on reddit ? 
  in your case it 's probably just that they do n't agree with your statement/opinion and it is a lot easier to just downvote . 
  you getting butthurt while people are dying in ukraine right at the moment and russia piling up military to the border ... is very childish . 
  no time to for this . 
  really . 
  ever heard the story about a boy who cried about the wolf ? 
  who are `` we '' ? 
  thanks , that 's what i 'm trying to say here .
