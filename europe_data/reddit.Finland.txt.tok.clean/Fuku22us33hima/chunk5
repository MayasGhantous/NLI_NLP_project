  people are now blinded with this `` humanitarian aid from russia is not allowed to ukraine , that 's awful ! '', 
  thinking . 
  when the truth is that there is no need for russian cereals or water bottles when they have better stuff on the shops and nobody is looting or robbing or burning or rioting . 
  this might look propagandish but it is real . 
  i 've seen a video of luhansk after one or two artillery/mortar rounds have exploded in a street with 5 or 6 dead and some single cases from the countryside , but those are not confirmed are they done by separatists or ukrainian forces . 
  still it does n't look anything near `` genozide '' or `` humanitarian catastrophe '' or something that would need truckloads of russian cereals or water bottles . 
  one body was lying in a field of corn and potato-field was looking just great behind him and chickens were running free . 
  he had an suspicious hole in his back head though . 
  there is wells , rivers , water pipes , bottled water , rain water etc. 
  in east-ukraine , that is n't some syrian desert or african dry zone , the ukraine is known as a `` bread basket of the europe '' because it 's all deep rich mould up to 10 - 30 meters and grows any kinda food products excepts bananas . 
  the thing is that media is hyping with this `` humanitarian aid '' theme and not understanding the big picture : russia is sending there weapons , chechen fighters , rpg 's , grad 's and other deadly shit but get 's a huge media attention when it sends there some salt and bandages . 
  that 's absurd . 
  why we do n't send there un convoy , the real red cross , un peacekeepers ? 
  because russia will veto it in the un council ? 
  and because there is really no need ? 
  civilian death rate is 0 - 2 per day . 
  that 's something what ukraine system can handle , even the wounding rate is low because many has taken seriously the orders to flee from the cities and have went for a temporarily asylum to ie . 
  those refugees can use the cereals . 
  i 'm not giving the link to the video i was talking about . 
  it 's made by separatists and they are giving too much slow close-ups from the bodies and other stuff . 
  it also has a `` comical '' commander speaking in a office with a map behind his head and a stock video of russian army grads firing . 
  it 's fishy and macaber . 
  but like i said , few bodies . 
  empty roads . 
  fields full of corn . 
  chickens . 
  press , go and see . 
  do your job . 
  stop laying on your fat asses and go to the field . 
  stop eating from putins hand . 
  wake up . 
  edit : fuck it , i have to give the link , otherwise i will be just another empty barrel : [ ** nsfl , nsfw ** contains dead people and blood !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx3mtfuwtzy ) if you clicked that , watch this after ... [ eyebleech , happy happy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu_9yi6xvrs ) what ukraine needs is peace . 
  russia can deliver that . 
  wounded or not , at least the news is spreading out fast : [ google search `` strelkov '' past hour ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=strelkov&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=egbsu6duiswg8wezwidyca#channel=fflb&amp;q=strelkov&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;safe=off&amp;tbs=qdr:h ) : all search results say he 's wounded or he is said to be wounded seriously . 
  was the original source this one news from itar-tass ( russia ) ? 
  anyway , if he is , then it is a major blow to the donetsk separatists . 
  i hope they surrender soon . 
  it will be much better for all , there is no need to fight over this , russia is not coming to help you . 
  then there is the luhansk area . 
  what 's the situation there , will they follow ? 
  they have the russian border on their backs , flee or get re-supplied ? 
  edit : now another media tells that he is ok : http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/13/ukraine-crisis-strelkov-idukl6n0qj4p920140813  ( reuters ) - separatists in eastern ukraine on wednesday denied a report that rebel commander igor strelkov had been wounded in fighting , the russian state newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta reported . 
   just look around here and see how often someone from germany or finland bitches about how ukraine is n't their problem and they should n't hurt themselves just to become a usa puppet as though an aggressive russia is n't europe 's problem but just america inventing things . 
  there are 2 million russian immigrants in germany . 
  and i 'm sure that here is quite a lot russian shills claiming to be finnish and using finnish flag and doing the dirty work . 
  also i 've meet some neo-nazies who are playing this `` divide europe '' game , one of them was swedish-finnish http://www.reddit.com/user/ramblinrambo and others . 
  they are just like the ukip / le pen people . 
  also there might be some finnish people who are defending their business ( with russia ) here and stupidly believe in eternal peace and prosperecy but i 'm sure the reality has hit them now . 
  finns are quite stubborn and `` slow '' people in some matters and sadly the finlandization has done some damage to that thinking . 
  also some people think that the only way to get into nato is through war , they believe that if we really try to get membership , putin will prevent it by war . 
  also the sweden who is not a member is some kinda excuse . 
  i 'm sad that there are some people who do n't see ukraine situation seriously and believe that we are an exception . 
  but those people are a small minority . 
  also our politicians have fucked up by avoiding the question for years . 
  do n't know about their connections to russia but seemingly ie . 
  the agricultural party `` keskusta '' have been avoiding it because finland exported a lot of that stuff to russia and the right wing party kokoomus is heavily financed from industry and other business sectors that do a lot of business in russia too . 
  they were both blinded by the money . 
  the average joe instead has always been aware of the threat and the support for conscription is very high , over 70 % :  they learned that the public support for conscription in finland is high , with 70 percent of the public supporting the system , according to a survey conducted last year . 
  http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/818712.shtml there is a slight negative impact on the winter war stuff : finns believe that they can prevent russia again and that it is not nearly as strong it was during the cold war . 
  and that is true , it is n't that strong . 
  and finns follow very closely the situation in russia and know all their military weapons , well 80 % , because we have same weapons left from the cold war era . 
  but things are changing rapidly . 
  this is not going to be a easy road . 
  russia will do all it can to prevent the possibly nato membership . 
  the scaring of us about the nato thoughts have started already last june : http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140612/defreg01/306120040/russia-warns-sweden-finland-against-nato-membership  finland and sweden have both rejected claims , made by a senior russian adviser to russian president vladimir putin , that `` russophobia '' is pushing the two non-aligned nordic states `` dangerously closer '' to nato . 
  the best solution would be that sweden and finland would seek nato membership together . 
  and get ready to some serious action . 
  this is n't a computer game ... 
  w\u00f6rk . 
  how did finland get back on its feet after the ww2 ? 
  w\u00f6rk . 
  and many years . 
  and do n't let your politicians turn into greedy oligarchs . 
  and is n't romania an oil producer ? 
  we have the same age problem , like the whole eu and russia . 
  remnants of the ww2 . 
  wiki says the median wage is 395 $ : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage you have to do something to your oligarchs . 
  they do n't give a shit about your misery , they just use you . 
  do n't let the same thing happen that did in ukraine ... the average salary there is 170 $ ... 
  the problems you are facing are not because of eu . 
  they are related to the poor ussr era and nicolae ceau\u0219escu dictatorship . 
  eu is n't soviet union . 
  romania is free to do something about it by themselves . 
  eu gives money to romania and nato helps to protect you . 
  of course there is european solidarity . 
  but it is n't a `` money machine '' that you can go every-time the wallet is empty . 
  greece did it and now look at it . 
  there was also greedy politicians who fucked up and lied to their people and were bad leaders . 
  yes , east-europe was very poor after the ussr collapse and it was obvious that people went to look jobs and income . 
  finland has been in that too . 
  when the country gets back on its feets and the incomes raise , many people move back . 
  but sadly the economics are getting worse at the moment because of russia sanctions . 
  although usa is also in a situation where people are moving outside to find work . 
  not to mention those illegal africans who are desperately trying to get to europe . 
  such is life . 
  lets hope that things turn to better . 
  we have to find solidarity in europe , not argue about national interests , the world is one planet and things are getting too hot at the moment . 
  that news is about rising energy costs all over the europe .
