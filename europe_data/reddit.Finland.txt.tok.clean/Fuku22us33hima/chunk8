  worried ? 
  just wait . 
  this deal could be easily sanctioned and cancelled . 
  these are not just `` icebreakers '' , those are multi-purpose use ships meant to be used at the arctic regions and support navy ships and subs . 
  and i do n't like this at all . 
  not at all . 
  fuck this deal and fuck russia , this is n't your game , you ca n't be trusted . 
  what 's the vibes in 6 months ? 
  i 'm looking it objectively : finland is the only non-nato country with ukraine bordering russia on europe . 
  what 's going on in ukraine ? 
  and i 'm not crying you a river . 
  i 'm telling you that i might know this stuff better than you , that your claim of the `` stalins purge '' being the reason why we could stop red army is wrong . 
  it was n't the `` incompetence '' of leaders , especially in 1944 when red army was battle hardened steam roll with shock armies , lend and lease weapons and shit . 
  and how can i not take this personally ? 
  the sanctions putin has launched are affecting me and my family personally . 
  and the putins war mentally is just 60km away . 
   tactics that worked because the soviets had virtually no senior officers with experience . 
  so , did finland had senior officers with experience ? 
  i know , it was an answer to the sweden-austria relationship comment . 
  that finland is in same situation as sweden . 
  rk 7.62 , the finnish variant of ak47 . 
  my whole life has been affected heavily because of ussr and ww2 . 
  my parents had to start from point zero after the ww2 . 
  they build a small cottage where they lived with a cow and hens their first winter in 1950 . 
  up till that they were refugees at other peoples farms . 
  personally ? 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  really . 
  the finnish army was in a lot worse condition than red army when the winter war started . 
  one of my relatives was send to hold a road cross with a rifle and five cartridges . 
  red army had thousands of tanks , air-planes , artillery , ammo and stuff . 
  it was the finnish will and clever tactics that beat the red army . 
  but we suffered a lot too . 
  a lot . 
  http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/russias-buildup-on-the-ukraine-border/996/ nato support is growing rapidly . 
   nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen has accused russia of using humanitarian grounds as a pretext for military intervention . 
   ** the red cross is yet to comment . 
  ** http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28743478 so not confirmed ... this is bad . 
  fuck , this is it . 
  well that `` chicken '' went all the way to berlin and half of europe . 
  and i said twice , winter war and 1944 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_tali-ihantala  the battle was one of attrition , with the finns suffering proportionally more casualties than the soviet forces . 
  [ 13 ] it marked a point in the soviet offensive when the finnish forces first prevented the soviets from making any significant gains . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ] however , already earlier at siiranm\u00e4ki and perkj\u00e4rvi the finns had halted advancing soviet forces . 
  [ 15 ] finnish forces achieved a defensive victory , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 16 ] although russian historian n. baryshnikov criticizes this as an exaggeration . 
  [ 14 ] i know my stuff . 
  i 've heard the stories from my grandparents and great uncles etc. 
  who were there fighting for their land and homes . 
  yes , my heritage is carelian . 
  i got still three great uncles alive who have that `` chickens '' bite marks on their bodies and souls . 
  these troops : 76th guards air assault division http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/76th_air_assault_division_%28russia%29 these are russian vdv aka paratroopers or `` spetznats '' , special forces trained to be dropped behind enemy lines , reconnaissance , guerilla stuff etc. 
  that division has seen action and ie . 
  in georgia , chechenya etc. 
  they were deployed on the ukraine border during the crimea annexation in ie . 
  did you just call me a coward ? 
  with love from finland . 
  putin also thought that yanukovych would remain in power in ukraine and join them to the eurasian union ... 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't want to sound arguing neither , sorry for the tone ...  but yes , nato has n't been in a big war because it prevents it by its size and military efficiency . 
  there is no nation or other alliance that have the nerve to attack against nato . 
  and no , afghanistan guerrillas and isis is not a nation . 
  ( this is for the other readers ... ) we are living turbulent times . 
  never thought i would see this day . 
  have any cases where nato has send people against their will to war ? 
  yeah , who wants a nation that stopped red army twice in ww2 to join them in defence ... 
  we are : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49594.htm  an individual partnership and cooperation programme ( ipcp ) , which is jointly agreed for a two-year period , lays out the programme of cooperation between finland and nato . 
  key areas include security and peacekeeping cooperation , crisis management and civil emergency planning . 
   an important objective in finland 's participation in the partnership for peace ( pfp ) programme is to develop and enhance interoperability between nato and partner forces through a variety of pfp instruments and mechanisms . 
  finland joined the pfp programme at its inception in 1994 . 
  same as sweden : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_52535.htm, 
  finnish soldiers have been in afghanistan , iraq , kosovo , etc. 
  just name a war what pops in your head , propably finns have been there : http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_suomen_rauhanturvaoperaatioista that 's only the peace keeping missions . 
  there is a steady stream from finland to the french foreign legion . 
  many finns choose the pro-soldier carrier because they love that stuff . 
  and they are good at it . 
  and we have been sending `` us '' to deadly places and we do care about those places . 
  you think the activity in the peacekeeping operations ( finland is constantly on the maxim level ) is just to let our boys have cheap cars ? 
  have you ever thought that it might be because we might need help one day ? 
  well , we live next to the bear ... , 
  finland is west . 
  we are eu . 
  by joining we would choose our side and be in a real defence coalition which russia scares and fears . 
  fuck the `` good relations '' , finland is just a `` meaningless piece of clay '' what they want to be part of glorious russia again :  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' .

  they teach that for their military officers for god 's sake ... is n't that clear enough ? 
  and that cannon fodder thing , you want to be cannon food with or with out nato ( 90 % of eu is in nato ... ) . 
  sanctions . 
  the sanctions putin put against eu is going to hit finnish food production etc. 
  hard . 
  the dairy industry is going to get a 400 million $ hit . 
  they are already starting to sacking people of . 
  all the other sectors are taking serious hits also . 
  it going to be like a small avalanche once it 's starting to go off . 
  also finns were negotiating a new nuclear plant deal with russia but that wo n't happen . 
  although there are still some idiots praying that to become true , but i 'm sure the reality will hit them fast .
