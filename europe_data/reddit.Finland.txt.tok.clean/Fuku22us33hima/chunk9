  the possibly next finnish prime minister said already goodbye to it on today 's newspaper on kaleva . 
  the thing is that russia knew that the sanctions will hit us , finland , hard . 
  was it a calculated move ? 
  also latvia and poland , baltics will be suffering a lot . 
  and still france is whining about that war ship ? 
  ** the thing is that this is a wake up call . 
  although finnish army is stronk , but hey really , it is not that stronk . 
  the question is : do you want to face the russian threat with 60 f-18 hornets or with nato air-force and ballistic nuclear threat ? 
  we have seen from ukraine how much nations can or will help if you are alone . 
  and it wo n't get any easier in the future . 
  as long as putin is on power , anything can happen . 
  the arctic region is already a hot spot and the next nato general secretary is n't norwegian just because the fox said so ... 
  the point is that if we are with eu sanctions without nato defence coalition , we are acting dangerously . 
  future is blurry . 
  finland is going to take a major blow . 
  `` funny '' how things could be so absurd :  `` it would be a great economic risk to finland to not tap the resources in russia , '' kivinen said . 
  `` we need to promote even more investment in russia so that finland 's relative position does n't weaken . '' http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/putin-beats-eu-as-finland-rediscovers-soviet-era-trade-economy.html just like we finns have never learned the lessons of the east ... now i see only one option : we must join nato as soon as possible . 
  we must try to secure what we have left . 
  finland 's economy is nothing on the putins game board . 
  it 's opposite : he 's going to use it as a weapon if he wants . 
  and he is using it already . 
  well , so does the eu . 
  but they are protected by nato . 
  why should finland join the sanctions 100 % if we do n't have the protection of nato ? 
  are we idiots or do we gamble with our future here ? 
  wake up finland . 
  i mixed up these things :  according a news report , putin replied by asking rabbi yosef to pass along a message to israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu that russia is a true friend of israel and of the prime minister . 
  http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=31099 http://www.collive.com/pics//nf_4077_138341.jpg  jul 9 , 2014 president putin : i support israel [ meeting jewish delegation in moscow ] sorry for that mix up , but it does n't not make the statement any more meaningless . 
  and the huge co-operation russia and israel are having . 
  and it is related on grey money , weapons and oil . 
  israel has made the drones russia is using to target ukrainians and giving them to separatists . 
  and there is a lot of more murky waters on those sectors ... again , sorry . 
  unbelievable ... it was this year , little over ** month ago ** . 
  how could he else said ( in israel ) that ...  i also heard about the shocking murder of the three youths . 
  it is an act that can not be allowed , and i ask you to transmit my condolences to the families , '' added the russian president , in referring to the abduction and murder of three teens in june by hamas terrorists ... ( look above ), 
  wou , that guy is full retarded . 
  you must get rid of him before it 's too late !, 
  is it true that he is eating from putins hand ? 
   russia has significantly built up its troop presence along the ukrainian border , making it ready for a potential large-scale invasion of southeastern ukraine if russian president vladimir putin so chooses . 
   the new york times ' michael gordon and eric schmitt report , citing western officials , that russia has nearly doubled its battalions along the ukrainian border in recent weeks . 
  seventeen more battalions and an additional 19,000 to 21,000 troops now compose a `` battle-ready force of infantry , armor , artillery , and air defense within a few miles of the border . '', 
  they could theoretically strike with `` little to no warning . '', 
  hungary , are you serious ? 
  have you really thought this throw ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_opera yes , it was iraq  operation opera ( hebrew : \u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4 ) , [ 1 ] also known as operation babylon , [ 2 ] was a surprise israeli air strike carried out on 7 june 1981 , that destroyed a nuclear reactor under construction 17 kilometers ( 10.5 miles ) southeast of baghdad , iraq but surprise surprise :  in 1976 , iraq purchased an `` osiris '' - class nuclear reactor from ** france ** . 
  humanitarian mission ... by russian army . 
  i 'm sure russia does n't mean un peacekeepers of any kind , they want to send in their own `` peacekeepers '' meaning that they will actually invade those areas . 
  this is just another attempt from moscow / putin to blurry the war they are having in east-ukraine against ukraine . 
  they have caused the mayhem and are now crying for `` humanity ! '', 
  what a nerve they got . 
  well , we make sausages of that blood , it 's called `` mustamakkara '' ( black sausage ) : https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8291/7825250248_b8777c93c6_z.jpg  / s, 
  yes he was , june 24th : http://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/putin_bibi114130-525x350.jpg?w=525&amp;h=350&amp;crop=1 http://nypost.com/2012/06/25/on-rare-israel-trip-putin-talks-about-syria-iran/  jerusalem -- russian president vladimir putin on monday met israeli leaders on a rare trip to the jewish state for discussions that focused on continuing violence in syria and iran 's disputed nuclear program . 
  also :  a significant number of russian citizens live in israel . 
  during russian elections , the russian government sets up polling stations across many israeli cities as well as smaller towns , in order to enable the russian citizens who are living in israel to cast their vote . 
  [ 14 ] among those are major criminals who have made millions during the wild 90 's etc. 
  and :  in april 2009 , russia purchased the first package of drones from israel ( the bird eye-400 , eight i-view mk150 and two searcher mk .2 uavs ) . 
  the deal was worth ** $ 53 million ** . 
  [ 24 ] in a second deal , at the end of 2009 , russia purchased an additional 36 drones from israel , in a deal worth ** $ 100 million ** . 
  [ 25 ] in october 2010 , russia purchased an additional ** $ 400 million ** of drones from israel aerospace industries . 
  the israeli drones are to be assembled in russia . 
  [ 26 ] the production of the russian-israeli drones began in 2012 , with delivery to the russian military scheduled for 2014 . 
  [ 27 ] also :  as of 2014 , ** russia is israel 's largest supplier of crude oil ** ( alongside kazakhstan and azerbaijan ) . 
   ** israel plans to enter a free-trade agreement with russia ** . 
  the customs union , bringing together belarus , kazakhstan and russia , and israel have launched an exploratory committee to study the prospects for the creation of a free trade zone ...  russia and israel have agreed to install a direct encrypted communication network , to facilitate communications between the russian president and israeli prime minister . 
  one analyst says : ** `` russia feels very close to the israeli leadership ... 
  the russians want to speak to israel without anyone eavesdropping . 
  '' ** [ 31 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel%e2%80%93russia_relations, 
  what self-defence forces ? 
  russians defending russia ? 
  they are terrorists . 
  shooting down a civilian air craft is action of terror . 
  until prove otherwise . 
  btw your link ... nice try . 
  yep . 
  why we allow israel to have nukes ? 
  `` a man can leave the kgb but the kgb never leaves the man '' ... and putin actually never left the kgb . 
  we have to remember also that if you have gone through kgb training all the way to an high rank officer , you have gone through heavy brainwashing and psychological shit that you are actually a trained `` robot '' . 
  this combined with big ego and enormous power with huge wealth is a very dangerous combination . 
  it 's said that putin was a andropov man and andropov was one of the paranoidist leader of ussr . 
  he was convinced that usa is going to attack ussr and almost launched his nukes in 1983 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ciy5r-tlie `` able archer 83 '' exercises that almost led to third world war between nato and warsaw pact . 
  bbc document . 
  i 've had this strange feeling about israel 's actions in gaza , that it is related somehow to putin and ukraine . 
  that they might have think that the ukraine crises may smoother they way to handle the hamas . 
  putin was in israel just before they launched the attack :  `` i support the struggle of israel as it attempts to protect its citizens . 
  i also heard about the shocking murder of the three youths . 
  it is an act that can not be allowed , and i ask you to transmit my condolences to the families , '' added the russian president , in referring to the abduction and murder of three teens in june by hamas terrorists http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/news.aspx/182754 so , israel got a green light from russia and usa to attack . 
  and now they 've gone much too far and had managed to cause revolts in france etc. 
  and destroyed their public image . 
  also they have shadowed russias action in ukraine in media . 
  is it related ? 
  what putin actually promised to israel ? 
  how much money putin has in israel banks ? 
  is israel helping russia to avoid sanctions ? 
  so many questions , so blurry answers ... yet . 
  but one thing is sure , this is highly fishy and disgusting . 
  the planet , global community is facing a unpredictable future and some people think that military actions are solution for their problems . 
  and these two have nuclear weapons . 
  where are we heading with all this ? 
  how come the world seems to gone full retarded just in few months ? 
  it is a war .
