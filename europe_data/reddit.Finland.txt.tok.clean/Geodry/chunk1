yes i remember it , i really enjoyed it as a kid . 
  i still remember the finnish intro and outro songs . 
  i 've been thinking about re-watching it some time . 
  absolutely brutal, 
  [ ei-turkulainen osakunta ] ( http://eto.fi/ ) ( an `` anti-turku '' student group from tampere ) doing god 's work ( ; _ ; ) 7 they do an annual trip to turku and try their best to sink it to the sea . 
  [ another take on pole dancing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8vagl73.gifv ), 
  one guy in my unit refused to handle a weapon so his service was changed to an unarmed one . 
  on the day we got our assault rifles he held a gun for the first time in his life and had a panic attack . 
  he said that until then he did n't know he was afraid of guns . 
  he ended up as a medic . 
  he did n't seem to mind serving unarmed and i do n't think anyone of us thought it was that strange or anything . 
  i 've never heard that , just lumisade . 
  he means that the prime minister approached poland after the crash instead of putin . 
  see his flair ( that tiny flag next to his name ) . 
  [ leip\u00e4juusto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leip%c3%a4juusto ) is a delicious finnish cheese . 
  it 's squeaky and yummy . 
  ah of course !, 
  fuel for the body and the mind . 
  err , why is pint labeled under energy rather than food and beverage ? 
  that 's 20 % of their finnish personnel , pretty insane lay offs . 
  please note that this is nokia , not the old mobile department sold to microsoft .

  got ta keep 'em russians away somehow . 
   women do their service to society by having children ( men doing theirs by serving ) it does n't work like that , conscription is mandatory ( if enforced ) , having children is n't . 
  why does a conscript army equal crappy hardware ? 
  you cut out the word `` former '' from what i said . 
  do n't try to twist my words . 
  of course serving conscripts do n't get sent overseas but once the service is over you can apply for peace keeping operations . 
  at least former finnish conscripts have been successful in peace keeping operations . 
  and finnish conscripts recently passed some nato test with flying colors . 
  interesting , i imagine the situation would have to be pretty drastic to call in the reserve . 
  wo n't do much good if they 're still not stopped at the border . 
  by the way , would n't they need to use the reserve to monitor the border if it would come to that ? 
  i doubt there are enough military police conscripts currently serving to monitor anything apart the designated border crossing sites . 
  i 'm a military police by training , maybe i should start to expect a letter from the army !, 
  ^ just ^ joking ^ ^ or ^ ^ am ^ ^ i, 
  i agree , i 'm a bit confused why finland lets refugees in from russia . 
  i wonder why the refugees get to cross the border without a visa , i would need a visa if i were going to russia ( unless i took a short cruise to st. petersburg , it is an exception ) . 
  once the swedish border stopped leaking russia opened the valve . 
  seems that they 're trying to destabilize finland . 
  i did n't even think about that , thanks for showing that point of view for me . 
  in reality that is not a problem in finland so such consern has n't even crossed my mind but now i can see why foreigners might be worried . 
  the news have said that the property is supposed to house russia 's little green men if they want to pull off something similar that happened in ukraine . 
  this is not about an ` actual invasion ' but a more modern way of war . 
  according to older news pieces , they have also been buying property near finnish military areas etc. 
  for monitoring purposes . 
  but this has been going on for years . 
  i do n't understand what this has to do with gestapo , stasi and dictatorships . 
  your german tax office for sure knows how much you make even if they do n't publish the knowledge like ours does . 
  open tax records is not a tool of oppression but transparency . 
   translation : you are not on the lists . 
  it 's okay , me neither :d haha , true !, 
  but i do n't think it would change my opinion . 
  what you said sounded like the majority is against public tax records but the government forces this upon us . 
  i think you have the burden of proof when you made that claim . 
  but i know there is probably no proof either way , i just wanted to challenge what you said . 
  about the envy , i do n't think the open tax records are causing it . 
  well off people have nice houses and better cars , you do n't need tax records to see if your neighbour is richer than you . 
  i 've never looked up people in tax records but i 'm not blind , i know who in my social circle makes money and who does n't . 
  but frankly , i do n't care who makes how much . 
  as a finn i 'm okay with this . 
  it adds transparency and makes tax evasion a bit harder . 
  it 's not like everyone checks what everyone else gets paid , each year you see these top earner lists and that 's it . 
  most people wo n't spy their neighbours etc as that would require a visit to the tax office . 
  and even if they do , i do n't really care as it 's not that big of a secret to me . 
  my friends/neighbours/colleagues already know what my job is and how i live so they can pretty accurately guess what i earn . 
  what do you base this on ? 
  i 've not heard about the popular opinion being against this , most people seem to be fine with the current practice . 
  if you mean a couple of pissed off people interviewed in a news paper , that does n't mean anything . 
  the most common names according to our population register centre : juhani korhonen ( male ) maria virtanen ( female ) the most common surnames : http://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/nimipalvelu/nimipalvelu_sukunimitop.asp?l=1 the most common first names ( males on left , females on right ) : http://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/nimipalvelu/nimipalvelu_etunimitop.asp?l=1, 
  the original source ilta-sanomat says that it was by mistake . 
  but anyway , it could be either way . 
  how is this fearmongering ? 
  it 's just a somewhat funny story about a guy being spooked by some soldiers mistakenly entering the wrong island . 
  what ? 
  the article had nothing to do with russia or fear mongering . 
  if finnish engineers are overpriced then everybody else here is also overpriced . 
  if a plumber or a construction worker makes more than an engineer who spent 5-7 years to get his/her education , i think it is a problem . 
  finnish prices require good wages . 
  edit : you 're right that skills required at nokia/ms might not be valuable here anymore . 
  many of them are hardware experts that no longer have anywhere to go after nokia and ms stopped hiring . 
  well , comparatively next to nothing . 
  you can see them hiring master 's level people for engineering jobs and offering around 2500 $ / month before taxes . 
  after a single person household rent and taxes you end up with about 1200-1400 $ / month . 
  in finland that is a very low salary for the level of the job . 
  average salary in finland is 3500 $ / mo and median is 3100 $ / mo. 
  that 's what they 're always saying . 
  from my point of view there is a raging shortage of experienced developers that are ready to work for next to nothing . 
  entry level jobs are really hard to find , they want experience for cheap . 
  actually 400 people moved from finland to estonia last year . 
  details are unknown but probably one motivation is work . 
  as a personal anecdote , i know one person who moved to estonia to work as a developer . 
  not much people are leaving finland even though the economy is bad . 
  two days ago it was on the news that last year 10 000 finns left the country which is apparently a pretty low number . 
  we still have lots of ex nokia and microsoft engineers unemployed from previous lay offs . 
  last month nokia once again announced laying people off , this time 1300 . 
  too many lay offs to realistically employ all of them to other companies . 
  microsoft just announced that it shuts down mobile development in finland and 1350 people will get laid off . 
  pretty bad news in an already bad situation . 
  brittle ?
