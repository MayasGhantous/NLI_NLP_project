  i 'm a loner , dottie . 
  the power gives me self-worth and a sense of belonging . 
  i ca n't speak for the other mods , but i 'm against it . 
  this is a serious issue and things are a bit scary and confusing and i think the dust needs to settle before we can enjoy shitposting . 
  and this is coming from the mod who stickied kyber a few months ago in / r/suomi, 
  i 'm three hours from helsinki . 
  it 's not that easy .

  so is this what leave wanted ? 
  my thoughts exactly , to be honest . 
  i 'm going to hate to see the good people of the uk hurting but at the same time , this is what they wanted , so . . they 'll get it , i guess . 
  that `` freedom '' comes at the cost of an unstable europe , an united kingdom , and a shit economic situation . 
  so . . congrats , nigel and boris ? 
  guns are not banned in finland . 
  finland has the fourth most guns per capital in the world . 
  hunting rifles are common . 
  not anyone can just go to the shop and buy a gun , though . 
  this guy had an illegal automatic weapon . 
  this is an incredibly rare event in finland , though . 
  now we know for sure . 
  people are so awful . 
  i hope her husband has n't seen any of it . 
  a news article would be required . 
  it ca n't just be a video of someone speaking . 
  we do n't allow standalone videos like this , sorry . 
  i know what i 'm talking about . 
  you 're arguing my choice of word , not my point , which says a lot . 
  refugees come . 
  they get asylum . 
  not all asylum seekers are refugees but in my example i was talking about refugees and their specific experiences during and after the asylum process . 
  you chose to ignore that . 
  i 'm not going to argue this any further unless you also have worked in this field in finland . 
  you 're arguing words . 
  this should be posted as a news article , not a youtube link . 
  provide a recent and reliable article and repost . 
  thanks . 
  for those who will only read the headline : bosnian guy flew from bosnia to sweden using a passport under his own name . 
  his passport was flagged and he was arrested , but then claimed asylum . 
  since he 's bosnian , though . 
  he has a known history . 
  this is a repost . 
  they have to go . 
  if they do n't show up , we literally go to their houses . 
  the issue is what to do before they 're granted asylum , and what to do once courses end . 
  this is an issue for every immigrant in finland , not just refugees . 
  before refugees get asylum , they 're just in the reception centers doing pretty much nothing unless the municipality has arranged a course . 
  otherwise its done by volunteers , who do what they can and of course ca n't be there eight hours a day every day . 
  if everyone who was so concerned about integration went to teach finnish for a few hours a week , there 'd be a huge impact . 
  but , like i said , after their applications are accepted they become regular ol' immigrants . 
  and after our courses end , we 're pushed out into the job market or encouraged to study , but the languages courses are pretty out-dated and a lot of people leave feeling frustrated . 
  they need an overhaul but nobody seems to want to talk about it . 
  this is a lie . 
  once you 're granted asylum , you get unemployment benefit like everyone else . 
  if you do n't go to your language course , you lose that benefit . 
  simple as that . 
  they will cut you off very quickly if you do n't do your obligations . 
  i used to work with spr and the city in integrating refugees . 
  the social workers do not take it well if someone behaves in the manner which you describe . 
  this was already posted . 
  hi.this is still a developing story , and since the source for this article is quite literally a sign in the window , i 'm going to remove it . 
  please wait for a more official statement from the authorities . 
  sorry , we do n't allow stand-alone videos like this . 
  we do n't allow stand-alone videos like this unless they 're apolitical . 
  thank you .
