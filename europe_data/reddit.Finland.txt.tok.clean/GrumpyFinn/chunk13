  brown people with the same ideas are scarier , despite the fact they do n't have any power . 
  they 'd rather have their rights taken away by people of the same race . 
  i can . 
  it 's sheer ignorance and reactionism . 
  the populist parties across europe have made it very clear they have no respect for the lgbt community , if your fear is foreign extremists with anti-lgbt values , why would you vote for a native , who has the power to actually make laws that limit you , thinking they would protect you somehow ? 
  it 's illogical . 
  i am regularly in this area . 
  i am devastated .

  this is wrong . 
  this sets a very ugly example . 
  i know eberyone is cheering because it sounds nice on paper but laws and ideas like this can easily be misused by future politicians against people they simply do n't like . 
  we can all agree that isis is terrible - but what if it 's not isis next time ? 
  basically i 'm against deportation for people who have n't actually been convicted . 
  especially people who 've only ever lived in said country . 
  this article mentions people with dual nationality but what if they did n't have that ? 
  i just think things like that need to be outlined in very explicit terms so in the future it does n't become deporting opposition 's children to somewhere random .
