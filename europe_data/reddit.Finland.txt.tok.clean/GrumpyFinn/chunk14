  i 'm terribly sorry . 
  i may not agree with angela merkel on many things , as i 'm not conservative , but i still respect her work and admire what she has done in her life and career .

  there 's a difference between center-right and far-right nonsense , though . 
  i can respectfully devate and disagree with those , while it 's almost impossible to have a serious , rational , and respectful debate with anyone of a similar mindset to wilders and trump . 
  how ? 
  all the left parties seem to have made huge gains . 
  on reddit , everyone more left than center right is a socialist .

  your first mistake is thinking i 'm a man . 
  we 've been waiting for years . 
  i do n't copy paste them . 
  i like to keep things fresh and personal when i reep all that k -- i mean . . when i remind people to be nice, 
  honey i wish they 'd pay us . 
  hell , i wish anyone would pay us, 
  literally me irl, 
  this is blowing up quite fast . 
  we understand that this is a difficult subject , but please remember our rules . 
  those who fail to remain civil will be dealt with . 
  thank you . 
  it 's like 400e a night with no gaurentee you 'll actually see anything . 
  save your money and actually do something fun here in finland outside of the tourist area .

  this shakes me up a lot . 
  the fact there are people who can say the holocaust never happened is baffling . 
  as it should be . 
  imo it 's one thing to be racist but keep it to yourself and not harass anyone . 
  it 's another thing to do what this group does . 
  i 've had enough first-hand experience to fully support the police here . 
  people would n't care if you learned finnish and followed the law . 
  i have lived and worked in finland for nearly six years . 
  there are many finn-americans in these parts . 
  i 'm an american citizen ... 
  pretty sure i do . 
  `` things that do n't effect me are n't real issues '', 
  not inherently . 
  you can present the argument without being hateful . 
  every thread , in probably every subreddit that deals with politics and social issues , gets an influx or trolls and rule-breakers if it reaches the front of / r/all . 
  finland had civil partnerships for a while . 
  the biggest issue has been the church and populists .
