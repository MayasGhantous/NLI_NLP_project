  forever, 
  why do you people keep bringing her up ? 
  she 's not relevant . 
  she lost the election . 
  your boy is president now . 
  stop deflecting . 
  huh ? 
  there are hundreds of children put up for adoption in finland every year . 
  plenty of straight couples do n't reproduce . 
  where is your concern there ? 
  the entire planet can not `` become homosexual '' . 
  i also highly doubt that you 're gay . 
  or people in higher church roles need to be more open . 
  i know several pastors here in finland that have been pushing for the church to be more lgbt friendly for years . 
  trump is both for and against it depending on when you ask him and who he wants to impress . 
  as a woman in a relationship ... sure , will do . 
  hey , we ca n't be the best at * everything * . 
  sometimes we have to let sweden win out of pity .

  we 're open to listening, 
  i liked it at the tine . 
  i was also 13/14 and in a phase where i thought anything big in europe was automatically cool , though . 
  the bbc article literally says he does n't have a migrant background . 
  stop . 
  i always thought they were romanian and now i feel like a giant idiot .

  yup . 
  they 're not allowed passports or education , and are only allowed to work in certain jobs . 
  and if they 're even remotely suspected of being involved in a crime , the government basically just starts arresting and killing them . 
  the police now say the guy was a german student from another town . 
  the buddhists of myanmar are essentially committing genocide against the ethnic minority muslims in the country . 
  they 're treated as sub-human and have pretty much no rights . 
  it 's a widely doccumented thing that the west ignores . 
  the bbc article states there is currently no indication that this was related to terrorism , and that the attacker may have been `` mentally disturbed . '', 
  please keep conversation civil and remember our rules about sources , as well as reddit 's rules on doxxing . 
  may the victims have a swift recovery , and may the police be able to conduct a thorough investigation . 
  the bbc article says he was mentally disturbed . 
  social housing anywhere is bound to be less than fun . 
  in my city it 's basically full of natives with substance abuse issues , severe mental issues , or both . 
  these kinds of things effect people regardless of nationality or ethnicity and it 's unfair that reddit ignores this so often . 
  it 's true , throwing money at those troubled people is n't the solution , but neither is writing off any chance of them getting out of that situation by saying `` meh , he 's ethnically somali , he 'll never change . 
  fuck it . '', 
  the issue then becomes that people do n't see a reason to overcome issues they might be facing because they feel they 'll be rejected and unfairly judged anyway , whether they 're the child of an immigrant who has trouble behaving or an adult native with an addiction . 
  in all situations , comprehensive mental health care is really important .

  frankly , it is more relevant to the discussion there . 
  this incident is not an issue of europe-wide importance with the current information we have . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is local crime . 
  see [ community rules & guidelines ] ( / r/europe/wiki / community_rules ) . 
  since the attacker has previous convictions and seems to have a history of doing such things , i 'm calling this a local crime .
