  of course they do n't go outside . 
  they might actually meet an immigrant and then have their head explode when they realize that they are , in fact , normal people for the most part .

  i know you 're being funny , but i dated a fennoswede called joakim several years ago and all of my american relatives , before meeting him , assumed he was african because , apparently , joakim is a `` black name . '',

  they do n't `` give them out . '', 
  you pay taxes and that tax money is used to keep services working . 
  no wonder everyone thinks we 're dumb . 
  it 's like you all think we ca n't possibly aspire to be like pther countries because we 're bigger . 
  try to sit back and think about how ridiculous that soubds . 
  sincerely , american in finland, 
  you mean the language the anericans got from england ? 
  they wo n't let us have anything :(, 
  that does n't matter . 
  a percentage is still a percentage . 
  hi , / r/all !, 
  please remember our rules when posting . 
  this is a happy day for our brothers and sisters . 
  bad behaviour will not be tolerated . 
  have fun !, 
  and this is the problem with populism . 
  it 's illogical to ban entire nations from being able to immigrate . 
  especially when there are plenty of non-muslims and secular muslims among them . 
  this is just silly . 
  not yo mention how trump 's ban conveniently left put saudi arabia but made it a point to include iran . 
  it is . 
  the manority of undocumented immigrants in the us are people who overstay their visa . 
  they do have doccuments , they 're just no longer in the system . 
  the people coming from the mexican border get the most shit from people but nobody ever seems to complain about the people who willfully broke an agreement by overstaying their visit . 
  she is n't even the general left . 
  she 's a conservative . 
  the news that 's often made up or confirned by the police to be fake ir heavily exaggerated ? 
  turns out the far-right and radical muslims want the same thing .
