  you expect people to follow the local laws when visiting your country , but you should be able to shit all over their laws in their country ? 
  it does n't work like that . 
  i 'm a proud feminist but i 'm also a proud obeyer-of-the-law . 
  they 're obeying the local law . 
  would you rather them get arrested ? 
  it 's basically just a handful of users causing all of those kinds of problems , which i think is the case if most subs/at least in the finnish reddits ) . 
  occasionally two people from countries with troubled histories will get into flapfights and we 'll have to behave accordingly , which can make things a bit difficult when everything is so emotionally-charged . 
  however , in terms of ap/hs , it really is just a few users giving us trouble .

  please use / r/askeurope - thanks, 
  please repost this in a swiss sub . 
  thanks . 
  60 % of the people affected are italians . 
  so ... i guess you are n't allowed to be catholic in his view . 
  why would you want an italian passport if your whole life takes place in switzerland and your only connection to italy is a few relatives you only see at weddings and funerals ? 
  i hate to burst your bubble , but there are n't actually horny and single ladies in your area waiting to meet you specifically . 
  i 'm a girl with pink hair who collevts records and watches hockey . 
  or me . 
  because then the `` new '' page would be full of porn spam . 
  i think it 's really unfair that someone is still considered an immigrant after three generations . 
  that kind of labeling and thinking is n't exactly good motivation for integration - though i 'm of the understanding that the majority of these third generation people are italian or from the balkans . 
  i think everyone has their own vision . 
  some of us like the idea of being more news-based while some of us like it to be more about cultural things . 
  we try our best to let the users decide what the sub should be . 
  but the main thing we all value is quality of content . 
  quality news , quality cultural posts , quality humour even . 
  we think our users deserve this . 
  we do n't like when people use four consonants in a row . 
  we do n't allow any use of the term `` good news '' . 
  hi , / r/all !, 
  this post is all meant in good fun and not meant to actually make anyone angry . 
  with that in mind , be good to one another and remember to read our rules before posting . 
  have fun !, 
  `` how will we ever know what they think of us now ???? '', 
  that 's exactly it !, 
  my boyfriend also told me that there was one tv show in finland that was so popular in estonia that a huge chunk of the southern population went north once just to see it , since the signed could be reached there . 
  there was another american in my city who just moved back to the us this month . 
  every time there would be a terrorist attack in france , she 'd post some five paragraph sob story about how much she would like to go there , but because of `` political correctness '' it 's no longer safe . 
  i 'd say the french are n't missing out on much if these are the people deciding not to go there . 
  once time there was a volbeat song on the radio and the guy 's voice sounded shittier than usual . 
  ot took me about 30 seconds to realize that no , he was n't drunk or singing with his mouth full , he was just singing in danish, 
  as usual , we 're better than the dutch, 
  my best friend is swedish-speaking and he said that [ this os all i need to know about denmark .

  oooh a cultural exchange with / r/makeupaddiction !, 
  well , if i may ... 
  sometimes we get really creepy messages , and those of us who are a bit shy do n't want to deal with them . 
  these range from general sexual nonsense to rape and death threats ( this is reddit-wide , i mean ) . 
  i was even in the finnish news last summer for getting these kinds of threats and messages from finnish and non-finnish redditors , and all the article did was cause me to get even more hate mail . 
  go figure i guess . 
  when two dudes argue , or when someone perceives you to be a dude , the argument may get into general personal attacks and petty insults , but rarely does it carry over into creepy messages or anything real .
