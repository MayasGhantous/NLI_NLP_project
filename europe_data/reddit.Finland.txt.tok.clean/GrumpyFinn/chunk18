  however , and i 'm speaking from my own experience so take it for what you will , when they know or find out you 're a girl , suddenly the pet names come out . 
  they start to use belittling terms like sweety and honey . 
  they start to verbally belittle you on a different level . 
  in heated debates , it can get really awful . 
  some women just give up . 
  again , i 'm saying reddit in general , not this sub . 
  i like to think we do n't have many users like this and the ones who slip in usually get dealt with swiftly and efficiently .

  username checks out , 
  you 're my favourite real belgian mod . 
  i want to thank all 121 people who voted for me . 
  as a finnish resident , the most important thing is that i got more votes than the swedish mod . 
  yes , but the third most popular mod is a woman !, 
  hopping in to also apologize .

  i 've been raped . 
  i hate rapists . 
  i absolutely hate them with all of my being and will never make excuses for them . 
  ever . 
  so please , spare the name calling for the people actually saying the victims deserved it or something equally awful , not me .

  their stat also fails to mention if any of the rapes performed by foreigners were done by the same person against multiple victims . 
  so simce almost no one who had commented here was finnish or living in finland , i will give some context . 
  roughly 1/3 of 3.7 k sex crimes were suspected to have been done by a foreign national . 
  here 's the part everyone seems to miss - a fireign national does not automatically mean refugee/migrant/whatever . 
  it could be a russian who 's lived here fir years . 
  it could be a british exchange student . 
  it could be anyone from literally anywhere here for any reason . 
  it 's also important to know that finnish nationals accounted for over 70 % of sex crimes . 
  it 's also important to know that sex crime is n't rape . 
  there were 1170 reported rapes for 2016 , which is 120 more than 2015 . 
  there are over 200 , 000 foreign nationals living in finland . 
  if 34.5 of 1170 ( so 403.6 ) of said rape was foreign nationals , assuming they were all finnish residents and not tourists or here on business , then 0.2 % of all foreigners raped someone . 
  but please , rather than sit and praise the police for the good job they 've done in certain places like oulu where 85 % of rape cases were solved , or discuss how to support victims ( some of whom were men , you know , so nice that you only care about finnish women but not men ) or reasonable ways to prevent this , or rather than celenrate that a country of nearly 6 million only had 1170 rapes last year , people just want to post memes and act like they actually give a shit about the every day life of finns when they think information fits their agenda . 
  also , finland is the safest it 's been since 2000 . http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_cities_at_their_safest_since_at_least_2000/9425336, 
  my russian classmate a few years ago said this , only about america . 
  his father had gotten the chance to travel to the us in the 80s for something , and said he started crying when he saw all of the food in a grocery shop . 
  it 's hard for me to understand . 
  i 've been so privileged .

  i disagree . 
  people who integrate and get citizenship deserve to be in a different category . 
  it 's a slap in the face to the irish person who went through the trouble to learn chinese and pay tax , respect the laws , and do their best to be a good citizen only to still tell them they 're not part of the club . 
  i mean ... did you read it ?

  my boyfriend has suggested riiga several times . 
  it will happen soon . 
  porilaiset do n't enjoy life, 
  one of the most active alt-right and pro-trump redditors is finnish . 
  they 're only against political dynasties that they 're not involved in . 
  yes , sometimes , and sometimes . 
  thanks , sipil\u00e4 . 
  do not attack other users like that . 
  op is a finnish national and , even if he was n't , he would still have every right to post here . 
  this is a warning . 
  please do not behave like this again . 
  which is hard for americans living abroad . 
  i sometimes get attacked on reddit and accused of `` faking being a finn '' despite having permanent residence and zero intention of ever going back to the us . 
  using american flair would be misleading , there are a lot of u who live and work in europe and feel more connected to life here than there .
