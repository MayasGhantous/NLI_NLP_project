  that said , even in the us there are a lot of people who claim to be `` irish '' or `` german '' because of one random great-grandparent and it 's really boring . 
  the longer i 'm away from the us , the more disconnected i feel . 
  it 'll be six years this summer since i was even there . 
  the actual buzzfeed article was well-done . 
  buzzfeed is n't all `` pick a brand of cat litter and we 'll tell you which kardashian to eat lunch with '' and whatnot . 
  sometimes they do have well-researched and well-presented pieces . 
  so , while one should always go into reading their stuff with their guard up , it 's not entirely fair to write it off completely simply for originating there . 
  they do have actual journalists on staff . 
  they do n't always , and that 's the issue . 
  it happens on reddit a lot with `` swedes '' . 
  i also saw/see this on reddit to this day in americo-centric subs . 
  `` i used to be a mega ultra tree-hugging leftist but then they turned on me so now i 'm supporting trump '' was a really common thing to see for a while .

  i still think it 's highly unlikely merkel wo n't be chancellor . 
  not really . 
  the referendum was n't legally-binding . 
  and anyway , all this says is that the pm needs to have leaving approved by parliament , aka democratically-elected officials , rather than her , a pm who was n't voted in as pm , making the move . 
  it , frankly , is exactly how it should go . 
  thank you . 
  that 's always nice to hear . 
  it 's an opinion piece and vice does n't generally have any content that goes against our rules . 
  the referendum was never binding . 
  it was more of a `` do you think we should leave ? '' . 
  the people slimly voted yes , we think we should leave . 
  but , the uk is not a direct democracy nor a dictatorship . 
  it 's the job of the parliament , as elected officials , to decide what 's best for the people . 
  the reality is that a lot of europeans felt a bit betrayed . 
  i 'm not justifying anyone being mean to the brits by any stretch , but a lot of people felt as thought you gave the rest of us the finger . 
  you mean the post that was on top of the front page for all of yesterday ?

  as an american abroad , ouch . 
  do you think , though ? 
  i genuinely believe that people would n't vote to leave if there was a second vote .

  i 'm not british , so my opinion does n't matter in the least , but i feel this is probably a good thing . 
  this is kind of why you guys even have a parliament , is it not ? 
  i did n't understand the direct democracy aspect of such a big decision .

  because the alt-right does n't respect women . 
  they try and pretend they do , on the topic of rape by foreign people , but then turn around and look for any way to delegitimize feminism and any other woman 's movements . 
  i read hundreds of threads a day . 
  you start recognising usernames and arguments after a point . 
  the people who talk about `` your women '' `` our women '' etc actually do n't give a damn .

  i think it 's the right thing to do . 
  even in cut and dry cases it just does n't make sense to publish names . 
  is n't it illegal to report the names until they have a conviction ? 
  or is that just finland ? 
  it was peaceful . 
  not a single arrest . 
  not a single incident of violence . 
  nothing hateful . 
  you can try to claim this but viseo evidence proves it was pretty uneventful in that way . 
  it 's about the tax . 
  please do n't intentionally mislead people . 
  in many states , feminine products are taxed as `` luxury goods '' . 
  yes , let 's completely throw out the rule of law . 
  citizenship and level of integration . 
  he 's a criminal rapist , so he 's a terrible person by default now , but there are plenty of people with two nationalities who 've lived in a second country long enough that it 's pretty unfair to simply label them as one . 
  or people with one parent who 's native and one an immigrant . 
  there 's a guy originally from kosovo in my city who 's been here for over 20 years . 
  his finnish is flawless , you 'd never know just from hearing him speak that he 's not native . 
  finnish wife , job , everything . 
  i have a really hard time not considering a person like that a finn . 
  same thing with this one woman who moved here from the us in the 70s . 
  i 'm not saying everyone fits this category . 
  i know russians who came in the 80s who can barely order food in finnish . 
  but sometimes reddit gets really hung up on this stuff and , as an immigrant myself who used to work with immigrants from skilled , highly-educated europeans to irawi refugees , this idea of integration is not so black and white , and the idea of when someone counts as being part of the new country , other than just on paper , is highly overblown . 
  if you want to be called sweidsh-algerian or swedish-estonian or whatever , then you can be . 
  it 's about your own effort when you move to a new country . 
  if you get citizenship and want to drop the `` algerian '' or whatever , that should be fine too . 
  reddit puts a scary and unhealthy amount of energy on ethnicity and genetics , when the real focus should be on actions and mindsets .
