  adoption is expensive , though . 
  and a lot of countries require you to live there for a certain amount of time before you go and get the baby . 
  of course they say they do , but what companies say and what companies do are two different things . 
  i was unemployed when i got pregnant , but managed to secure a job for after my maternity leave ended . 
  a few people i know , though , were unemployed and got pregnant , and it just made their employment prospects even more bleak because now their cv has one or two years of nothing . 
  one of them just keeps having kids because she feels like she ca n't find a job anyway . 
  and yes , she 's finnish . 
  unlike what finland is currently doing - cutting everything and trying to make everything more expensive . 
  my friend group is mostly academic , and only a few of us have kids . 
  it 's partly because some are just not into it , but a big reason is that i 's expensive . 
  it ruins the woman 's career for at least two to three years , and then daycare costs are high unless you 're really poor . 
  food , diapers , everything just costs a lot . 
  the baby box helps , and the monthly child allowance helps a little ( everyone gets it , it 's not just for the poor or whatever ) , but this government has made it clear that anything and everything will be on the chopping block , and the uncertainty of costs is causing a lot of people to just wait . 
  and they might end up waiting until it 's too late .

  i do n't understand this argument coming from an american . 
  when is the last time congress did anything for you ? 
  i 'm american but live here permanently . 
  the pros for finland being in the eu far outweigh the cons . 
  there is a very small minority who think finland should leave , but that 's about it . 
  we 're not the uk . 
  we need europe . 
  false information from outside sources hell bent on weakening europe is the problm . 
  it 's a shame the far-right has become so obsessed with `` multicultural '' things destroying europe that they fail to see they 're doing the bidding for governments that actually do want to divide and literally conquer us . 
  we have to stick together .
