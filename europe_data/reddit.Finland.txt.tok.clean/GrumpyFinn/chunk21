  this goes deeper than refugees or `` feminism '' or whatever reddit is obsessing over this week . 
  amazon.de is getting really good . 
  they 'll find a way to cope . 
  what 's important is rhat the rest of the eu sticks together . 
  things are about to be very scary for a while,

  i am deeply invested in france . 
  this has been posted several times over the past few days and does n't need to be reposted . 
  stop reposting this . 
  this is a repost . 
  it was in a really random part of the city . 
  every finn kbew pretty much right away that it was most likely some sort of accident based on location alone . 
  there was an article a few weeks ago about deportation flights to iraq . 
  a lot of those who are denied do n't want to stay anyway, 
  over the past year the agency says it had rejected about half of 28,216 asylum applications while approving about one quarter of them . 
  fourteen percent of the applications were written off and eight percent were dismissed before being processed . 
  removed for being a repost,

  it 's missing a few tracks since not every artist is on spotify .

  this has been reposted several times already, 
  it literally is . 
  this was just a car accident , literally . 
  finnish state media reports that the driver had a medical emergancy while behind the wheel . 
  as such , this is not european-wide news .

  thanks, 
  animal rights people burned busses amd you blame leftists and pro-immigrant groups . 
  okay . 
  i need to search for it , but it was poliisi 's own numbers . 
  it was highly upvoted in the last thread about this here . 
  things were really weird last fall . 
  they have mostly gone back to normal , but the media amd populists tried very hard to scare people into feeling a certain way . 
  a result of this was a lot of hard-working people with dark skin feeling really unsafe for a few months . 
  things are fine now . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  you might get drunkenly bothered but if you say you 're working/studying those people usually back off , as terrible as that sounds . 
  during the height of the refugee crisis last year , my indian coworker had a few really shitty experiances with people yelling racist stuff at him , but thankfully it never went further than that . 
  report anything to the police if you ever feel personally targeted or afraid . 
  have you ever been to finland ? 
  we do n't really have antifa , just some wannabes . 
  you 're free to look up the 2015 crime stats for far right vr far left crime in finland . 
  far right had double the instances with many of those being assaults and other violent crimes . 
  far left was mostly ignoring the police and things of that nature . 
  i 'm getting tired of non-finns/people not living in finland bringing up antifa or `` far left violence '' . 
  we do n't have all that much violence to begin with , that 's why people hate the finnish resistance movement - for trying to encourage violence . 
  thiscgets reposted every few weeks and nothing has changed since the last repost , so i 'm removing this . 
  there 's still some weird stigma on reddit about calling nazis nazis , though . 
  a year ago , if you 'd said this in certain subs , you 'd have been called a leftist sjw who hates finland and blah blah blah . 
  it 's better now , but it was really bad at one point . 
  certain groups on reddit really tried to spin the idea that neo-nazis were n't nazis , just concerned , average people fighting against the letists who hold them down - despite not a single left party being in the current government in finland . 
  the finnish resistance movement is a neo-naxi group . 
  before anyone shows up whining about the classification , please google them . 
  they deny the holocaust amd harass immigrants and politicsl `` opponents '' regularly . 
  these people do not need to be defended in any way . 
  they are the definition of scum . 
  they litter my town weekly with racist flyers , usually near schools and playgrounds . 
  they take photos and videos of people without their permission and get right in their face to try amd instigate the other person to attack them . 
  they keep registries of people they do n't like/people they consider traitors and many of them have been charged for doing so . 
  they are neo-nazis . 
  let the downvotes pour in . 
  i 'm the one who has to constantly worry about these losers beating up my friends , not you . 
  this thread would make more sense in / r/askeurope or / r/askuk . 
  thanks . 
  yeah . 
  i go to lidl every so often to browse around , but unless they 're having super lauantai or something prisma is almost always cheaper . 
  the whole `` lidl is cheapest '' is just clever marketing . 
  i have a few friends who refused to accept this until i started sending them pictures of my reciepts . 
  lidl is n't that cheap anymore . 
  prisma is actually the cheapest place to buy groceries .
