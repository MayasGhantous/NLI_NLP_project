  the first part of your statement is somehow true - they 've lost about 10-15 % of support since taking power , but that 's quite a normal thing for any ruling party . 
  however , the second part of your comment is extremely misleading . 
  there have been some protests by the far-right that might draw a few hundred , but the counter-protests are usually much larger . 
  futhermore , basically every political party agrees with merkel 's refugee policy , aside from afd . 
  to imply that `` millions '' are protesting is unfair and dishonest and i feel you 're deliberately trying to misinform people on the issue , which is n't fair .

  i 'll allow it . 
  americans do n't want to hear it , but it 's access to guns as well as how america worships gun ownership . 
  i lived in rural us for like ten years , and moved from there to a small finnish town . 
  back in the us , everyone had a gun , usually multiple guns - people who i would n't trust with microwaving my lunch , let alone operating a deadly weapon . 
  people who can barely write or read , who barely got through school and who post violent facebook image macros about shooting people with different political views . 
  in finland , i know a lot of people who own guns for hunting , and i feel a bit better knowing that they were n't able to just drive down to prisma on a whim one day and buy one . 
  we do have crimes with stolen guns in finland , yes . 
  but on the whole i feel safer here . 
  this has been removed for not having enough context .

  this belongs in / r/askeurope - thanks . 
  this lacks sufficient sources , so i 've removed it .
