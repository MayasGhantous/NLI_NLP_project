  probably trying not to cause a panic . 
  old people get sick , even royalty . 
  these illnesses are taken seriously of course , but if it 's not life-threatening then there 's no need to over publicise the matter .

  in the name of christmas peace , be respectful in this discussion . 
  i will be especially hard on people trying to incite violence or hatred on christmas day .

  this is a repost from a few days ago . 
  also , the title is n't very good . 
  i might allow a resubmission with a better title . 
  thanks and merru christmas, 
  the christmas peace is an old trafition , if anyone was curious . 
  here 's a pretty good write-up https://www.turku.fi/en/christmas-city/declaration-christmas-peace, 
  i 've removed this for being off-topic and lacking context . 
  if there 's a news article from a good source on the matter you could post that , but that would also need context . 
  try / r/sweden . 
  the titl said nothing about what or where this was , and i 've never heard of this website, 
  i 've removed this for being off-topic . 
  i think this submission is better suited for a british sub . 
  thanks . 
  these are just getting silly now .

  removed for being a bad source with a bad title . 
  try to use a european or german source for german politics , and one with a more descriptive headline . 
  removed for being a shitpost . 
  we do n't allow low-effort and hateful tripe like this . 
  i 've removed this for being a repost . 
  many people osting here in the last day do n't seem to care about the rule of law and it 's really scary . 
  the police ca n't just hold the guy for being an immigrant . 
  all these people calling the police incompetent - surely if the dna from the guy did n't maych that in the truck , then there 's no reason to keep him . 
  i have removed this , since new information from german authorities seems to indicate that this was the wrong perso . 
  i still fail to see the logic . 
  he clearly was n't a refugee if he was from pakistan , so naturally his asylum claim would be denied and he would then be an undocumented immigrant . 
  merkel wanted to help refugwes . 
  he is n't a refugee . 
  people like this have existed long before the refugee crisis . 
  it 's a weird mix of finnish , swedish , and english . 
  i 've removed this for being a repost . 
  it 's still not something we allow here . 
  this post has been removed for having personal information and being low-quality . 
  please ask this in / r/askeurope . 
  thanks, 
  can confirm . 
  i do n't know a single leftist ( most of my friends are left alliance voters or active with them ) with good things to say about putin . 
  my friends who support the populist parties all think he 's great because he stands up to feminists and brown people . 
  the populists love him and trump and do n't understand why we ca n't all just be friends . 
  it 's like a lot of you native finns do n't remember your own history . 
  laughed out loud at this . 
  thank you . 
  this is a repost of a repost of a repost . 
  please . 
  we 've had like five threads on this already .

  this has nothing to do with refugees or immigrants . 
  aalto is a very common surname , yes . 
  there 's a website where you can see surname statistics . 
  paging / u/harriv, 
  according to the article i linked from yle , sippil\u00e4 sent twenty angry e-mails to various journalists at yle .

  yes , saara aalto , the plainest , most average average pop star to ever be average at pop star-ing . 
  but , finnish media has been going nuts about her . 
  `` finland mentioned '', 
  a conflict on interest involving the pm and members of his family . 
  it was huge news here two weeks ago . 
  the pm sent the broadcaster e-mails telling them to hold off on any more articles on the subject . 
  here http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/two_yle_journalists_resign_citing_limits_on_freedom_of_speech/9351895 many wanted sipil\u00e4 to resign after this came out ( myself included !, 
  ) , but , as per usual in finland , everyone is mad for a minute and then goes back to suddenly caring about x-factor uk because suomi mainittu and other trivial stuff . 
  the lack of consequences from this situation is really quite disturbing . 
  people have already been quite annoyed with sipil\u00e4 and our current government 's cuts to things like student benefits ( after promising they would n't !, 
  ) , and now this . 
  for context , sipil\u00e4 is from the centre party . 
  our current government consists of the centre party , the coalition party ( conservatives ) , and the true finns ( our populists/immigration skeptics/whatever they prefer to be called this week ) .
