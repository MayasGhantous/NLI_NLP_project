  before the americans show up : finland pretty much already has some level of basic income . 
  everyone is already entitled to rent benefits , student benefits , unemployment benefits , etc. 
  the disabled are are also offered a pension and a subsidy to offset living expenses . 
  these things are provided by kela , which is not the welfare office , . 
  the welfare office is a different thing , and is meant for one-time economic help , like food or clothes . 
  pretty much every finn deals with kela at some point in their life , but not everyone deals with the welfare office . 
  the idea of basic income would be to create less bureaucracy at the kela level , since right now being unemployed ( or someone who works a few hours here and there for is still technically unemployed ) is a bureaucratic nightmare . 
  basic income would help that . 
  a lot . 
  this is not going to change * that * much , or cause everyone to quit their jobs , or whatever . 
  i feel like i need to say this every time this topic comes up , because the comments are always instantly filled with people ( usually americans ) whining about `` nanny states '' and saying that this just encourages people to be lazy , or is going to cost sooo0o0o0o much money .

  the fact so many people are missing this is mind-boggling . 
  of course they did n't hack trump , he 's their bud and is now doing their bidding . 
  they hacked the candidate they did n't like and then got their troll army to dominate online discussion and sway opinions that way . 
  you think rnc e-mails would be full of sunshine and rainbows ? 
  they 're probably even worse . 
  but when you only see one side , and every comment chain you read is dominating by one group with one goal in mind , you never get the chance to hear about the other side . 
  baltic states and finland should be very concerned by this .

  you 'd have some kind of ptsd or anxiety , too , if you lived in such an unstable area where war and bombings were a weekly event . 
  i think it 's unfair to say middle easterners as a whole , rather people living in unstable areas . 
  i 'm willing to bet a lot of south sudanese also now suffer from some kind of post-traumatic problems . 
  humans are awful . 
  this was a big theme in us elections . 
  anerica is safer than it 's ever been . 
  police are safer than they 've ever been . 
  we 've deported three million undocumented people under obama , and quality of life is on the upswing - but people feel crime is up and people feel it 's not safe , so ... look what happened . 
  it 's religious people in general . 
  i met a christian lady here two years ago with ten kids and another on the way .

  not every act of violence needs to be posted here . 
  there was a murder-suicide on the turku archipelago over the weekend and that 's not here . 
  this does not have europe-wide implications . 
  sorry , hit the wrong button . 
  should 've been local news .
