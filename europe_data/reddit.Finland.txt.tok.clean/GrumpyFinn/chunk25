  this beongs in / r/romania . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's fucking terrifying, 
  but the alternative to that is n't far left , is my point . 
  reddit seems to think merkel is a leftist , which should worry literally everyone - that reddit 's base has gone so far to the right that the christian democrat leader is now considered to be `` too far left '' . 
  we mods get accused of censorship and pushing an agenda or what-e-ver , but on a forum where a conservative christian is considered to be on the same level as a leftist , the average reader should probably get the hint that someone is trying to mislead and misinform ( hint : it 's not media or the mods ) . 
  finland still has a long way to go imo . 
  our populist party 's youth chapter had some kind of anti-trans tantrum a few months ago , and we had a lot of people freak out after it was announced same-sex marriage would go forward . 
  the biggest people against lgbt rights are the hard-line christians and the populists who fear muslims are going to come and take over . 
  the attitude within the church here is changing , though . 
  i have friends who are pastors who have been doing what they can to let lgbt people know they 're welcome . 
  amazing that people who claim to want to protect `` european calues '' on this sub suddenly want to impose american values everywhere .

  the bbc is n't fake news . 
  because the original article said foreigners . 
  they 've sinced changed it . 
  we all read the article before the update . 
  well then that 's fucking racist and absurd . 
  if i , as a on-french person , had to move to france for work and my child attended school , i would expect her to either have the same rights as every other child , or a tax credit for the amount of whatever school would cost . 
  simple as that . 
  french children can get an education in finland without a fee , so why should n't finnish children in france ? 
  or any other child , for that matter ? 
  and fuck over the children of those already living there , who have zero say in where they live . 
  but what about foreigners with kids who pay tax ? 
  do they now get to pay less tax ? 
  so if i move to france for work and pay my taxes and all that , my kid wo n't be entitled to any of the things my taxes pay for ? 
  awesome . 
  it 's ridiculous how these people target innocent children like that . 
  all children deserve an education . 
  how else can they grow up to be functioning members of society ? 
  / u/baneken is the hero we all deserve . 
  so that thread about women not deservign the right to vote was all a dream ? 
  then you are n't alt right . 
  their own websites and forums openly hate women . 
  did you miss the big fuss over women being allowed to vote last weekend ? 
  this comment is going to get downvoted because it 's feels before reals with these people , but a post with hundreds of comments at the top of their sub decrying why women , specifically single women , should n't have the right to vote is pretty up there when it comes to woman-hating . 
  this is why finns think we anericans are all mouth breathers . 
  can you please not ?

  i made this comment before any ages or identities were announced . 
  chill . 
  23-year old man from that town . 
  he had a crimimal history . 
  this has already been posted . 
  i thought so initially . 
  however , one victim was the chair if the imatra city council and the other two were journalists . 
  given that this also happened in a very.public setting , i think it 's an exception to the local crime rule . 
  now that it has come to light that these women were relatively public figures ( city council and journalists ) , i have approved this . 
  sorry for that , op, 
  rifle shots to the head . 
  i 'm wondering if one of these wonen was an ex of his or something like that .

  removed - this article keeps getting reposted despite being clickbait and misleading . 
  to both : how do you manage work and life ? 
  you both have such crazy schedules . 
  do you ever get time to just sit on the couch and eat junk food ? 
  this is exactly it . 
  i organized this for a number of reasons , but i 'll list the biggest : 1 . 
  / r/europe should be a place for more than just politics . 
  culture is important , and music is a big part of a nation 's culture . 
  many people only thing about finland in terms of metal . 
  this is a chance for our european brothers and sisters to learn more about finland than just what stereotypes dictate . 
  the finnish subs have a lot of problems . 
  if this goes well , we could do more of these with musicians and pop culture figures from other countries , too . 
  i want this sub to be about more than just brexit and putin . 
  these amas could be a greay way for us to understand one another better .
