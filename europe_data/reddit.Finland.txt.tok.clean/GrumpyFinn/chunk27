  they 're a bunch of obese neckbeards here . 
  they 'd never be able to catch me . 
  i 'm fine with the antifa stickers . 
  i do n't support antifa , but they 're fun to put overtop the finnish resistance movement stickers just to trigger em , since our city does n't have any antifa people . 
  i know one actual communist . 
  he lives downstairs and is always trying to get me to come eat with him . 
  it 's not the weather , it 's men . 
  every day we 're one day closer to the sweet release of death than we were the day before .
