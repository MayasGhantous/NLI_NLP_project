  ah , there it is . 
  i live in a bubble here in a ps stronghold , yet you live in an alteenative reality where people are afraid to support a political candidate . 
  if only election results agreed with what you just said . 
  fwiw , i know quite a few people who like/respect soini , but only one person who openly likes halla-aho . 
  and i live in satakunta . 
  most of the ones i know are from the islands past vaasa , but i know a few from espoo/helsinki . 
  of course when i 'm down that way , especially in the one helsinki cafe i frequent , i do see people that fit the stereotype . 
  however , as far as the people i 'm close with , they 're either total larping sci-fi nerds , scientists , or some other kind of academic , or just straight-up country folk .

  huhtasaari scares me more . 
  creationist nutjob . 
  which is funny to me , since every swedish speaker i know is either a total nerd or a fisherman . 
  the prominent propaganda website in finland , mv-lehti , which is ran by a criminal russian dude , loves halla-aho . 
  expect more of this in the coming weeks . 
  they were doing `` fake news '' before the term existed and they have a small , but vocal , group of trolls who likes to make seven million accounts just to upvote one another . 
  it has been a huge problem in the finnish subs for over two years . 
  the finns party has consistantly been polling under 12 % for ages , yet if you go on finnish reddit you 'd think , judging by what gets upvoted , you 'd think they were a huge party with a huge backing . 
  the reality ? 
  people thought they were bad before , but now they 've alienated their moderate supporters . 
  hating halla-aho is probably the one thing you can get most finns to agree on short of coffee . 
  where are you stats about the finns party and the homophobic and transphobic stunts their youth wing , for example , have been a part of ? 
  it 's unfair to go after ncp for such a thing when top-level members of the finns party are openly homophobic . 
  and no , i am not a left alliance voter . 
  would you rather that have the embarrassment that is huhtasaari and hakkarainen as ministers ? 
  huhtasaari is very much anti-gay and a creationist at that . 
  they would have both been ministers if the finns party would have stayed . 
  is that really what you want , as someone who claims to be `` left of center '' ? 
  because i am sorry , but i genuinely do n't believe you .
