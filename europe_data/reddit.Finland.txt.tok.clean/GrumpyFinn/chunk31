  keep it civil . 
  remember that genocide denial is against our subreddit rules .

  i 'll never say their name . 
  they do n't deserve the fucking attention . 
  they killed him when he tried to leave . 
  then harassed my relatives for years . 
  i googled him a few years ago to try and find out if any of the news from the time had been achieved , but all i found was a newsletter from the cult which spoke of his `` untimely death '' and all this other cryptic bullshit . 
  exactly this . 
  it 's so frustrating how many people miss this . 
  i dyed it for my quarter-life crisis . 
  i hate myself for understanding this comment . 
  [ i guess i could pass for a waifu ... ] ( http://imgur.com/a/9kpm7 ), 
  while i was modding the subreddit , you were studying the blade ? 
  i 'm the only female mod and this is terrifying .

  islam is just a cover for those people . 
  they do n't give a shit about the religion , it 's just a convenient excuse to get to play `` badass gangster '' for a lot of them . 
  what people forget is that isis is a death cult . 
  racists like to cry `` bwaaah it 's all islam '' , but it is n't . 
  it just so happens that isis claims to be islamic , but it could have easily been a christian death cult too . 
  at the end of the day , they want death . 
  they want war . 
  they want `` the end of days '' . 
  and small-time drug dealing losers in prison who want the chance to be a big shot latch on because they get to live out their stupid fantasies .
