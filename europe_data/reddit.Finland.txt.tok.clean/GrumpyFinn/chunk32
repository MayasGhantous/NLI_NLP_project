  my family understands this stuff all too well , but i 'm heavily downvoted whenever i bring it up because it 's much easier to be an edgy teenage white boy , downvote , and then post a racist rant than it is to actually think that maybe the person you 're replying to might have a point .

  it does n't attack you as a trump supporter . 
  its just a joke . 
  the report button is not the `` i 'm triggered '' button . 
  this post is all in good fun . 
  a little friendly ribbing between countries never hurt anyone . 
  this post is n't meant to be malicious or incite anger , it 's just a damn polandball comic . 
  because you asked : http://m.imgur.com/333554f be civil and good to one another and try to just enjoy the joke .
