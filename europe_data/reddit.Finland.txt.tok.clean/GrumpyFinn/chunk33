  in the last two finnish elections , my local pirate candidate seemed a bit too libertarian for me , which turned me off . 
  i respect privacy and think the government 's purpose should be to protect individuals from corporations spying , collecting and selling data etc , or having outlandish punishments for a child downloading an album illegally . 
  but when it came to other issues , like education and social services , suddenly they were way much in favor of private corporations . 
  so . . maybe i just miss the point . 
  m\u00e4mmi is made from rye and water and a bit of orange zest . 
  the process to make it takes like two days i think ? 
  and it 's a lot of work . 
  you 're left with a sweet-ish sticky bready puddingy thing . 
  i eat it with vanilla ice cream . 
  ** it 's not that bad . 
  ** bread cheese/squeeky cheese , or leip\u00e4juusto , is actually delicious . 
  eating that with cloudberry jam is amazing . 
  or just using it in a fruit salad . 
  to be completely honest , it feels like he 's just `` acting '' as though he should hate it . 
  m\u00e4mmi i guess is n't for everyone , but bread cheese and cloudberry jam is just . . good . 
  it 's not `` special '' , but it 's good .

  so ... clearly a typo then . 
  otherwise he would 've used the same title in both instances . 
  what is yoir proof of that claim ? 
  it 's clear from context that it was unintentional . 
  he wrote the title in descending numerical order . 
  stationary bicycle, 
  i do n't even know who i am, 
  genuine question : do you truly and honestly believe we 're paid for any of this ? 
  i have n't deleted anything . 
  i 'm sitting on the cluch drinking rose and watching the lion king . 
  wow . 
  last week i `` will never be finnish '' . 
  this week i 'm `` not really anerican . '', 
  ca n't win wjen you 're a mod . 
  look , bud . 
  i 'm american . 
  op made a mistake . 
  period . 
  i hold an anerican passport but have permanent residence in europe - how the fuck would the typo benefit me ? 
  op made a mistake . 
  we tagged it . 
  calm . 
  down . 
  ugh i wish that 's how reddit worked . 
  yeah , how dare we all be busy on easter weekend . 
  you ca n't edit titles on reddit . 
  all we can do is tag it , which we did , as well as stickied that comment .
