  it 's not misinformation when i 've clearly tagged the thread in both the comments and the title with the correct number . 
  well , that was embarrassing . 
  again , we 've tagged it as a typo . 
  my fellow mods may disagree , but i 'm very much against removing things that are already on the top of / r/all unless they are in serious violation of our rules . 
  op making a typo is an accident , i 'm sure . 
  but it 's too late now because this is already on / r/all . 
  the title is supposed to read ** usa 29 % ** , not 2 % . 
  we 've tagged this as such . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  try not to be too hard on op . 
  also , please follow our rules and behave in a respectful manner . 
  thank you .

  fgm is n't a muslim thing , it 's a tribal thing . 
  some of the biggest fgm countries are actually christian . 
  the quaran does n't even mention it .

  yeah . 
  they are in england too . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/babbar_khalsa nothing against their religion . 
  they do great work when it comes to feeding the poor . 
  but the way redditors act as though islam is the only religion with extreminism and then try and say that sikhs and buddhost extremism does n't exist is just ... odd . 
  finnish greens are also closer to the center .

  this emtire thread is doing that for muslims . 
  i remember when they blew up a plane nwar the irish coast because of their religion . 
  i do n't understand why reddit acts like radical sihks do n't exist .

  in finland , lunch is a pretty big deal . 
  almost every restaurant has a lunch buffet . 
  the cost usually ranges from 6 $ for soup and coffee to anywhere from 8-10 $ for a full buffet with warm dishes , salad , coffee , and sometimes dessert . 
  what 's it like where you are ? 
  edit : til i pay way too much when i go out for lunch . 
  all this brexit stuff is heavy , so let 's lighten it up with a bit . 
  hi , everyone , we 're experiencing quite a lot of traffic today due to the referendum , with many new users dropping in . 
  we 're happy to have you on board , but we 'd just like to remind everyone , old friends and new , about our rules , specifically these : self-post discussions and questions about brexit and related events are best suited for / r/askeurope , the mega sujet or one of the several news discussion threads non-european news and politics - the largest subreddit for these topics is / r/worldnews . 
  graphs , maps , infographics , videos etc lacking a credible source - if it 's not present in the picture/link , post it as a comment . 
  editorialised titles - do not add your opinion/commentary to the article 's title . 
  do n't add something that is n't covered by the article , and do n't misrepresent the article . 
  adding a sentence verbatim from within the 1st paragraph or byline that is more representative of the content is generally ok but only where it improves clarity . 
  misleading titles - even if taken directly from the submission , a title must not be misleading . 
  if what one assumes from reading the title is different from what the article says or what is reported by multiple other sources , then your submission may be removed . 
  this also applies if the title states an opinion as a fact . 
  if the original title is misleading , you may give it a more neutral \\ factual title . 
  news content lacking context or basic information like what , when , where petitions , advocacy , surveys , advertising or marketing - they must be cleared with the moderators before posting . 
  we will only allow such submissions if we think they are a substantial contribution to the subreddit , and only in the form of a text post . 
  blogspam ( if stolen content/direct copy ) - original news content on blogs is fine , but the largely copy-pasted stuff from earlier articles with a short line or paragraph of commentary is not . 
  if you find a blogspam talking about something relevant for / r/europe , put a little effort into finding the source of what the blog is talking about ( if it really is european news , this should n't be too difficult ) . 
  image macros , memes , reaction gifs and similar low-effort content facebook , tumblr - just no . 
  twitter - unless from major official accounts . 
  if you submit a twitter link , contact the moderators . 
  duplicates - do not repost a submission if it has already been recently posted . 
  in some cases we may remove submissions when there are already multiple submissions on the same event or topic , and further submissions do not add anything new . 
  meta posts/complaints - these go in / r/europemeta -------- for the rest of the rules , please go [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) thank you and happy posting !, 
  please be civil,
