  the darkness has also started to get to some people . 
  i see their airline quite frequently on flightradar but their flight schedules and destinations to and from tallinn always seemed inconvenient . 
  but if you make the child care benefit , say , 700 instead of the current 200somwthing plus the extra money people in specific areas get , mothers have more motivation to stay home past the normal 10 month period and the queues for public daycare would decrease . 
  unemployed people would get a slight raise . 
  there 's no punishment here . 
  everyone wins in the svenario i just described . 
  the main reason i went back to work so early was because i could n't live and buy baby stuff on 400/mo . 
  i do n't understand how anyone gets punished this way . 
  lol gamergate ? 
  seriously ? 
  that 's your criticism of nyt ? 
  in finland the basic unemployment , basic maternity , basic pension are all within 50 $ of each other , iirc . 
  the only lower ones are student benefit and childcare benefit for babies under 3 . 
  so . . i disagree that this would hurt people . 
  quite the opposite , if they increased the maternity and childcare benefits through basic income , i bet you more people have kids . 
  those both look great !, 
  i would n't say that . 
  the place across from my house makes food that is way , way healthier than pot noodles . 
  and they use mostly local or organic foods . 
  that makes sense . 
  in my friend group , lunch is the biggest meal usually . 
  my boyfriend and i both usually just have some ye bread and peanut butter for dinner because lunch is so big . 
  norway . 
  i 've yet to meet a norwegian man that was n't both sexy and charming . 
  only a coward kills children . 
  i 'm getting really tired of these fucking cowards . 
  you guys keep cherry-picking examples and i do n't like it . 
  i 've been in two different reception centres every day for the past two weeks . 
  are there `` economic migrants '' ? 
  sure . 
  but out of the 350 + people i 've seen in this time , the majority are fleeing violence and trying to get their shit back together . 
  the stories they tell are heartbreaking . 
  i sincerely advise you to stop reading selective media examples of these people and actually go to a center and talk to people . 
  in harjavalta it 's literally the woods . 
  and there 's no bus from that centre to harjavalta so they walk 12km ( 6 there and 6 back ) to lidl . 
  in reposaari it 's similar . 
  they have a sale somewhat close and then can take the bus to pori but the bus is not cheap and they only get 91 $ / mo so that 4 $ a trip adds up fast . 
  in my part of finland the centres are far from everything . 
  6 km from a grocery store and another 35 to a city, 
  did you forget that iraq and afghanistan are also warzones ? 
  so stay home then . 
  i was unemployed for years and it was hell . 
  all that `` free time '' amounts to nothing if you have nothing to look forward to and no certainty about what your future will be . 
  mock this person all you want but that 's depression that he 's describing . 
  but i guess this is / r/europe so we just mock depressed people if they 're brown . 
  i 'm an atheist and i do n't like pork other than bacon . 
  plenty of non-muslims do n't eat red meat . 
  this is stupid . 
  i doubt anyone really gives a shit . 
  we can go to estonia if we reallyt care that much about the price . 
  same . 
  only rarely do i buy beer from the grocery store on impulse . 
  usually i go to alko with a specific thing in mind that i 've read about online . 
  i reckon that sounds a bit snobby but meh . 
  i like that alcohol in finland is expensive because i think it deters a lot of people from drinking when they should n't . 
  i mean we still have alcoholism but i definitely buy less beer and wine because of the prices , and that 's healthy, 
  yeah !, 
  regular swedes should be able to just burn things down and kill people with fire !, 
  c18 is a nazi organization . 
  the thing is , in finland at least , the same people protesting refugees also harass beggers . 
  the main dude from my local nazi group that claim to be c18 and have been showing up yelling at the meetings that have been held locally about refugees has gotten into trouble several times for filming himself harassing beggers . 
  it 's no secret here that both groups are targeted . 
  dude . 
  i forgot about this song !, 
  the mod team is currently a sausage fest . 
  it would be nice to have another lady mod with me . 
  it 's funny until you realize people actually believe it . 
  same in finland . 
  almost all reported crimes by the far-right are assaults , drugs related , or stalking / keeping illegal databases of their `` enemies '' . 
  crimes by the far left are almost entirely not listening to the police or something similar . 
  these are the polices own crime statistics . 
  seems like it 's the case almost everywhere, 
  give us gaute orm\u00e5sen instead pls, 
  removed for clickbait title and for being misleading . 
  use the actual title next time . 
  but why do any of you think a conservative government was ever going to do that ? 
  oh no :( i wish him the best,
