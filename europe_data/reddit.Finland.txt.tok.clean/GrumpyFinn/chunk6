  what have i done ? 
  i 'm sorry you feel this way . 
  removed for being low-quality . 
  we try our best, 
  because the comments at the time of tagging were literally on the level of rip yurop thanks merkel white genocide etc. 
  most of the people commenting had n't bothered to read the article but were eager to come and shitpost, 
  just wait a few weeks . 
  then it 'll be a depressing grey color for five months !,

  they fund a lot of projects , including a radio station i used to work for . 
  just my two cents on the `` local news '' rule , both as a mod but also as a reader . 
  sometimes it 's not enough to just leave it up to up and down votes , we are a major sub , and because of that we have various groups , from left to right to probably martians , trying to influence the content that ends up at the top of the front page . 
  because of this , sometimes things that really are local news ( a shooting by someone against their ex or someone they know in a major city , for example ) will end up at the top of the front page in a very quick period of time , simply because someone involved might be an immigrant , for example . 
  the fact is , if there 's a crime of passion or isolated gang violence or just a random robbery somewhere , it 's not european-wide news . 
  this is grumpyfinn the redditor talking , not grumpyfinn the mod . 
  this is just my own opinion , but it just gets really old . 
  more arathian,

  weird . 
  my bangs and hair cover a lot of my face in my passport picture , you ca n't see my ears or forehead at all . 
  the hijab does n't hide the face , just the hair downvoted by people who have no idea what a hijab is . 
  nobody 's panicking . 
  they do this kind of stuff a lot . 
  citymarket had 4kg of macaroni for 1 $ last week , so i 'm prepared in any event . 
  those are animal rights activists . 
  we are n't talking about that . 
  in finland you are much more likely to be hurt by the far right and far left . 
  a user in / r/finland pointed out that the far left had 16 crimes last year , but 11 of those were ignoring the police or something similar . 
  the far-right had over 30 , over half of those were assaults and the rest were weapons trafficking and keeping illegal registries of their `` opponents '' .

  that 's how head injuries work . 
  you do n't usually die right away , but rather 3-5 days aftet, 
  they like to put their flyers around playgrounds and schools . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  i used to live across the street from a primary school and i frequently had to tear down their stickers or remove their flyers from windshields . 
  holocaust memorial day last year they had put stuff everywhere . 
  before the misinformation begins , the group people are upset with is the finnish resistance movement , who are , indeed , neo nazis . 
  they deny the holocaust and are hated by pretty much * everyone * , hence the large amount of people . 
  there were protests all around the country today and there were attended by ministers and mps from different parties , even the pm . 
  so before the brigade of `` but they 're just violent leftists trying to silence concerned citizens ! '', 
  army shows up , no . 
  these are the actual concerned citizens uniting across party lines . 
  the governent is constantly cutting services that working people need , like daycare . 
  we pay taxes and want those taxes to pay for things we need . 
  that 's how it 's supposed to work . 
  we 're not supposed to have those services cut while members of parliament hide their money abroad and then sit back and say tough luck to everyone else .

  this group is n't antifa . 
  there were thousands if people and similar protests took place in other cities . 
  tjis was a massive event organized against the finnish resistance movement , a neo-nazi organization that denies the holocaust and whose member killed a man last week , and against similar movements and ideas . 
  it was a protest against far-right violence that was supported and attended by much , much more than just the `` far left '' or whatever . 
  even my conservative friends hate the finnish resistance movement . 
  the prime minister even attended one of the protests . 
  he 's from the centre party . 
  dear serj i went to high school in a rural part of pennsylvania . 
  we never learned about armenia or the genocide . 
  many people i went to high school with were obsessed with your music yet somehow knew nothing of your cause . 
  when i came to europe , i finally learned more about armenia , the genocide , and your activism . 
  it alm9st felt like we purposely were n't taught this subject . 
  what is your opinion of how the armenian genocide is taught in the us ? 
  do you find us americans to be more or less open to learning and helping armenian causes compared to europeans ? 
  thank you . 
  i 'd be very curious to see the results of this poll . 
  something tells me the numbers would be equally high , but the articles would n't get nearly as much attention . 
  i 'm talking within finland . 
  in finland eppu normaali has sold 600,000 more than nightwish . 
  eppu normaali has sold more records . 
  something like 25 % of the finnish population owns that one greatest hits album . 
  edit : no i remembered wrong . 
  that 's their best selling , but in total they 've sold over 1.5 million albums . 
  so like 25 % of the population owns and eppu normaali album . 
  edit 2 : nightwish is pretty far down on the list . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_albums_in_finland but here they 're high .
