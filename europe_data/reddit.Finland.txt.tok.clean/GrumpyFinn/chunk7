  in finland it 's the same `` immigration skeptics '' who hate jews just as much . 
  on holocaust memorial day they plastered my city with flyers saying the holocaust never happened and other racist shit against jewish people . 
  this is the same group who hands out flyers calling multiculturalism cancer . 
  it 's not welfare . 
  the unemployment benefit is money for those unemployed or those working and earning less than a full time wage . 
  it 's a monthly cycle where you have to tell kela how many hours you ever worked that most things and provide a payslip . 
  it 's just a lot of paperwork .

  those of us who stay permanently tend to want to integrate and want to be a part of society , so naturally we 're going to behave and do our best . 
  the issue is with americans who are only here for work for a year or two . 
  they 're super cringey and do n't really care how they behave since they know they 're never coming back after their contract ends . 
  russians . 
  most syrians we had were exchange students who decided to stay and start families . 
  i know one who 's been here for like 10 years .

  meanwhile , millions of other male doctors delivered muslim babies without issue this year . 
  and those problems are n't going to be fixed by banning a swimsuit . 
  integration is about earning the language , paying taxes , and being part of society . 
  integration is not forcing people to take off their clothes . 
  if you feel that all muslim women who choose to wear that swimsuit are forced into it , why would you think forcing them to do something else is any better ? 
  people deserve the right to choose what they wear . 
  i know what it 's like to have an abusive husband that forced me to do things i did n't want to , but what i wanted was a choice . 
  you 're effectively taking away these women 's choice . 
  this has no positive consequences from an integration perspective, 
  and that 's not the case in europe ?!, 
  every country is like that . 
  that 's hardly an american thing . 
  it 's a southern baptist thing . 
  that 's exactly how i feel about the kind of `` christianity '' people who wear those suits believe in . 
  it 's incompatible with american values and modern values as a whole , but the americans in this sub ( which seem to be the loudest ones in this debate , which is hilarious ) always seem to want to say it 's different . 
  it 's not different . 
  it 's the exact same thing . 
  that 's not true and you know it . 
  you think southern baptists give their daughters and wives any say in this ' ? 
  there are plenty who wear it willingly and plenty who do n't , in both cases . 
  acting any differently is just naive . 
  what is the point of this comment ? 
  she 'll be saved and thank him and move on . 
  the end . 
  the burqini thing is mind-boggling to me for a few reasons , with the biggest being the fact that christians in the us wear something that looks almost exactly the same but does n't cover the hair - yet i 've never heard anyone say a word about that , and i hear nobody rushing to condemn the swimsuits even though they 're oppressive . 
  you see them in the american south all the time . 
  google `` wholesomewear '' . 
  just a rant . 
  there is no such thing as a burqa being required excapt maybe in saudi arabia . 
  iran requires a hijab . 
  hijab is required but hijab does n't cover the face , just the hair . 
  ffs if you 're going to talk about this at least know the items of clothing . 
  and i know plenty of muslim women who do n't even wear the hijab . 
  yeah . 
  since when is it okay to creeping take pictures of people at the beach , regardless of what they 're wearing ? 
  guy did n't deserve to get hurt but the lady and her friends had every right to be annoyed . 
  helsinki does n't have ikea .
