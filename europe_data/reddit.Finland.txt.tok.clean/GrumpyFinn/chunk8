  i wish the media would actually start doing this . 
  calling in fake bomb threats is n't new . 
  i remember after colombine , when i was still living in the us , suddenly every high school kid thought it would be funny to call in a bomb threat . 
  you still see it on the local news where my mom lives from time to time . 
  they have to take these calls seriously even with almost no evidence,

  my uncle joined a cult at 18 that later ended up killing him . 
  a christian cult that figured out he was troubled and lonely and thus were able to manipulate him into doing anything they wanted . 
  it tore my ultras catholic grandmother to pieces because they took her son , and because they used a completely fucked up interpretation of christianity to do so . 
  i 'm not giving anyone a pass for anything and saying anyone has a right or justification for killing people . 
  i 'm saying that in cases of mental illness we ca n't just start screaming racist shit and getting elections about the fact a pesky brown person we did n't want to let in behaved in a bad way so now we 've got justification to act like shit heads towards other people of the same , regardless of whether ot not they have anything to do with one another . 
  i hate religion and what it does to people but what i really hate is how we ca n't talk about manipulation . 
  we blame it on `` culture '' or try to say it 's a racial thing that people do stuff like this . 
  maybe it 's because it 's easier to try to blame race or ethnicity than to actually fucking think . 
  my uncle was n't a bad person . 
  that 's what they have been recently . 
  non religious sick people ( sometimes ) hiding behind religion . 
  the kid in munich was n't religious at all . 
  the nice attacker was a violent dude who barely even went to the mosque . 
  cults pick on people like this on purpose . 
  it 's sad . 
  but as usual nobody wants to think . 
  this thread is full of people celebrating this because they get to feel right and get to have justification for their prejudice . 
  almost nobody wants to talk about the real issue . 
  who 'd previously tried to kill himself twice . 
  but i 'll wait for the brigade of new accounts to tell me how hd was a devout muslim mastermind who hated our freedom and not a mentally disturbed person who wanted to die .

  that 's exactly it . 
  they want to be right . 
  that 's the scariest part , to me . 
  so they 're just going to laze around while someone else does the work to integrate them and teach them local culture ? 
  and that describes most children of immigrants . 
  i was at a party a few weeks ago with a little polish girl who has perfect finnish and goes to regular school . 
  i 'm sorry but that kid is finnish to me . 
  pretty sure she had n't lived in poland since she was a baby . 
  finland too . 
  eu immigrants from helsinki area are always so quick to say that there 's no bullying or racism in finland towards immigrants simply because it does n't happen to them . 
  on the whole finns are wonderful , but racism and bullying happens everywhere and it 's just plain denial to think otherwise . 
  my old job involved organising youth events for immigrants and finns as a way to help make the immigrants integrate . 
  it was amazing how unhelpful the friends of mine who complain about immigrants not integrating were . 
  we had board game nights and movie nights and all kinds of stuff and they always said they were n't interested . 
  like , okay i guess but you 're no longer allowed to complain . 
  i 'm not making excuses for anyone but since 2010 * seven * people from my high school have killed themselves over bullying . 
  one was 14 and slut-shamed so bad she hung herself . 
  i 'm an immigrant myself and i get daily hate mail on here and social media telling me to `` go home '' , and that my kid whose only ever lived here should `` go home '' . 
  you think that shit does n't hurt people ? 
  you think people can be verbally and even physically abused for years and just . . deal ? 
  some people start using drugs . 
  some people drink . 
  some people kill themselves and take others with them . 
  it 's terrible but it 's fucking preventable if we just start thinking about our words and how we use them , and what we say around our kids . 
  expect to see more of this . 
  far-right folks have no limits and they pass that lack of respect on to their kids . 
  even in this subreddit , hourly , we get people saying that turks , iranians etc born and raised in europe still are n't really european and do n't belong here imagine being a kid and hearing that every day when all you want to do is fit in . 
  it sucks . 
  and you can expect to see more people lashing out if we do n't start taking a real look at the language we use , especially when talking about kids . 
  please use the real headline,

  this is already the top post in the sub . 
  the finnish sub has triples and all discussion is in finnish , about pretty much everything . 
  the english sub is just self promotion and easily-googlable questions . 
  the immigration spam last year scared a lot of people away . 
  that 's exactly what i mean ... 
  a lot of foreigners who 've gained citizenship use the native tag . 
  if someone wants to help set up a subreddit survey , that would be cool . 
  but just from what gets posted and upvoted and the sheer number of subscribers compared to the finnish sub , it 's pretty obvious . 
  i 'm not french . 
  i do n't give a shit . 
  but you linked to an american blog as a source for news on france . 
  removed for having a bad source . 
  link to the original french source and not an american editorial . 
  sorry but this is a repost . 
  please repost this to / r/askeurope . 
  met some lovely students from galway this past winter . 
  all but one were absolutely lovely and made galway sound wonderful . 
  i hope to visit one day . 
  sorry but this is local news .
