  ugh who needs to watch got when you have present day uk politics ? 
  if you harass someone repeatedly and they keep saying no , and you keep getting more and more aggressive until she says yes out of fear , that 's still rape, 
  i 'm speaking as a survivor : if my attacker got three year or 30 years , it does n't change the past . 
  the victims get no benefit from a longer sentence other than maybe the feeling of revenge . 
  there 's a different between justice and revenge and i think a lot of people in this thread are missing it . 
  it does n't turn the clock back for me . 
  it does n't suddenly make everything okay . 
  it just makes vengeful people feel like * they * got justice . 
  there should be a system where repeat offenders , or people who clearly are n't learning anything from their punishment , ca n't go back out and hurt people - but this is a case-by-case thing . 
  there 's a difference between some idiot teenager annoying a girl until she half-consents because she feels uncomfortable and wants him to stop and a grown man who violently goes after young girls . 
  i do n't have `` concern '' for the rapist any more than i do anyone else . 
  i think people have a right to privacy . 
  let 's say a guy rapes a girl at 17 . 
  it 's terrible . 
  he gets sentenced and serves his time . 
  eventually he comes to terms with the damage he 's done and feels terrible about it . 
  nothing he does can help the victim but at the very least he tries to turn his life around and help other young people not make the same stupid choice he did . 
  but his picture and name wrre posted everywhere in a country of five million . 
  and in smaller towns if you know who the rapist was you can usually find out who the victim is . 
  the victim deserves as much privacy as they want . 
  no matter how hard the rapist tries to not be a shitty human being , if his picture is everywhere he 's never going to get a chance to be a functioning member of society . 
  rather than just the victims life being ruined , now we have two ruined lives . 
  i think jail terms should be strict but i also think we have to get to the bottom of why a person would do something like that and to find a way to ensure they do n't do it again . 
  posting their picture everywhere takes away any chance they might have of rehabilitating , especially if a bunch of internet tough guys decide to harass them or even attack them . 
  and what if they 're innocent ? 
  i 'm speaking as a survivor myself . 
  i 'll never forgive him but if he wakes up one day and realized what he did ( maybe he will , maybe he wo n't ) i want him to be able to get `` normal '' and give back to the community somehow . 
  even the morning after i never wanted his identity to be public-public . 
  it does n't make my wounds heal . 
  it does n't magically fix the issues i have . 
  thinking of the two most recent convictions of immigrants attacking someone , the names were most definitely published . 
  it most definitely is encouraging witch hunting if you want to release a name and a photo so they can be `` publiclyublicly shamed '' . 
  we 're a country of five million people ffs . 
  it just encourages people to deliver their own idea of what justice should be rather than trusting the authorities . 
  yeah !, 
  stupid finnish media not wanting to encourage witch hunts !, 
  / s they publish names after a person has been convicted . 
  no point in publishing a name before that anyway unless you think everyone accused of rape is guilty until proven innocent, 
  my co workers blames the eu for why his family 's farm failed . 
  he 's also a libertarian and refuses to even do what our boss asks most of the time because he does n't like `` being told what to do '' . 
  i import it from canada . 
  ever since my boyfriend met me he 's told me he wanted to take me to south germany . 
  same . 
  we 've been planning a trip to england for ages but we decided yesterday to go to norway or germany instead . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
  hopefully this is only some weird phase . 
  hunting . 
  i needed to pick up something from the lost and found at my local police station a few weeks ago and i saw 5 different people carrying hunting rifles , since after you buy a gun you have to take it to them to make sure it matches what you applied for . 
  living in the city center , it never really dawned on me how much hunting people in rural areas probably do . 
  no personal attacks , please .
