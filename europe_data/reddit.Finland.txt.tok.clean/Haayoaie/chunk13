  canada and australia are also more progressive than uk on the list . 
  progress is not always easy to compare . 
  for example prostitution , zoophilia and medical use of cannabis is illegal in sweden and legal in finland , and both allowing them and banning them can be seen as progressive , as their banning could also protect the population and its animals . 
  on all surveys about education and innovation finland scores higher than sweden . 
  on the human capital index 1st and bloomberg innovation index 4th , for example . 
  finland was n't also like an african colony , but about 1/3 of members of the st\u00e5ndsriksdagen was always from finland . 
  how is it possible that within one month finland has been declared the most stable country , the country with the best human capital and now the most socially progressive country while the economy has crashed ? 
  the unemployment of ** sweden ** is your average european unemployment . 
  true . 
  for example in sweden the joblessness rate among swedes is extremely low since the immigrants consume but do n't work . 
  there is no border control to greenland while only nordic citizens can move there . 
  so nothing stops a german or french flying there and living there illegally . 
  apparently it 's not worth the hassle . 
   can they have different immigration policies ? 
  that 's actually also possible . 
  there is free immigration for nordic citizens to greenland , while other citizens need a visa . 
  svalbard is the opposite : while only people from eu , switzerland , iceland and liechtenstein can move to norway without a visa , there is free immigration to svalbard . 
  enough benefits and healthcare should be given to the gypsies so that they do n't have to submit themselves to organized criminality . 
  romanians should be really ashamed of their country . 
  the last week i saw a gypsy lacking both feet begging on the street . 
  the reputation of romania is ranked worse than the reputation of saudi arabia and still you refuse to treat your gypsies humanely and force them to beg in the cold in foreign countries . 
  yes , i 'm sorry that i did n't add a legend , i thought that `` everyone '' recognizes the rural areas and that they are against eu . 
  the blue is for eu in all 4 countries . 
  uk is the only sovereign country to have had a referendum about exiting eu . 
  the nordic referenda in 1994 were about joining eu . 
  i thought of that , but then i thought it 's so obvious what they mean that i did n't add them . 
  is n't it obvious ? 
  yes , if you mean the one on the finnish mug . 
  which is stupid because an exit wo n't affect immigration from outside europe . 
  it 's banned by default and there is exceptions to the ban , and this wo n't change with an exit . 
  i have noticed that many britons are against immigration in general , while in finland refugees are of course not welcome but few people have anything against european immigrants , so that at most 86 % welcomes european immigrants . 
  is this difference only due to cultural reasons or are there so many european immigrants in uk due to the language that they cause ** real ** problems ? 
  interesting , i have always thought that the british media must be of high quality due to bbc and the economist , but almost all these newspapers seem to be trash . 
  how is it possible that the `` daily star '' newspaper costs # 0.20 ? 
  the longest day is on the june 21st everywhere between the equator and the polar circle . 
  you have n't perhaps noticed it because the difference between june and july are n't that big in spain . 
  ( in helsinki it 's easy to read a book outdoors at 1 am due to the light coming from the northern horizon , while north of the polar circle the sun is above the horizon june 21 . ), 
  migration from other european countries will decline with an exit , and the amount of immigrants from outside europe stays exactly the same . 
  almost no refugees move back home since their countries are so poor and it costs nothing to live in europe . 
  and idk if 25 % is that unrealistic . 
  if sweden took 90,000 muslims each year about 25 % would be muslims in 2050 . 
  at least in the group `` me and the persons i know '' nobody can understand why uk would want to exit . 
  i do n't get the point of these two lists . 
  the first list contains randomly either small or poor countries and the second list randomly either large or rich countries , which makes the list insane as the rich and small sweden is on the oppressing side and the rich and small finland on the oppressed side . 
  try to decide whether it 's the size or the wealth . 
  neither europe nor u.s. take in poor people . 
  switzerland is still part of the single market , free immigration area , schengen zone etc. 
  even though it 's not part of eu . 
  i do n't get it , why would the swiss be so special ? 
  why could not only such religious symbols be banned that are problematic ? 
  if the pastafarians used bare breasts as a religious symbol , should either it be allowed or all symbols banned ? 
  in western countries a woman having many husbands would probably be as common as a man having many husbands . 
  among the muslims women would of course not have many husbands but they are such a small part of the population that it does n't matter . 
  in r\u00f8dgr\u00f8de med fl\u00f8de , is n't just the r sounds guttural and the d is replaced by the sound of getting strangled ? 
  but is n't the gross wages and other income higher than the statistics show , because the tax evasion is done by not reporting your income ? 
  so it would about 45 % of the gross domestic production that is known , instead of being part of the shady economy . 
  what 's the problem with polygamy ? 
  if someone wants to marry someone from the same sex , a brother , two brothers , two women or whatever what 's the problem ? 
  that 's probably because they were the mainstream or status quo choice . 
  now voting on the far-right is `` rebellious '' in the same way as voting for liberals or leftists were previously . 
  there was actually something about this shift in the article . 
  italy and sweden have the same tax level , but i assume italians do n't pay the taxes since it has at the same time a far worse welfare state . 
  it 's problematic that the statistics show that they have the same taxes , since for example tino sanandaji , a kurd living in sweden who hates the welfare state , writes that if usa had higher taxes it could end up as italy or greece and not as the nordic countries . 
   our public transport is in shambles , i 'm happy if it 's on time . 
  stockholm has the largest rail network per capita i 've ever seen in a city , so that might be a thing where the tax money has gone . 
  interestingly the maintenance standards are at the same time worse than in many other european cities . 
  no , the wages in norway are 1.35 times higher than in for example sweden . 
  it could be that people living on the countryside visit cities more often than people living in the cities visit the countryside . 
  but why would it make the poll shite when its purpose is to show the skew ? 
  i would not say it 's so much the media but the way of speaking , moving around and clothing . 
  muslims move around in large groups that scream the language so that everyone hears clearly the language for example in a bus . 
  it could also influence the estimates that people from the countryside visit more the cities than people from the cities visit the countryside . 
  people living in the country see more areas full of muslims than people living in the cities exclusively white areas . 
  of course it 's not about the prayers themselves , but making denmark an uncomfortable country for muslims . 
  sauce : http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/power%20cut%202015%20interactive.pdf the chart is about co2 reductions in energy production . 
  yes and no . 
  russia or belarus have problems with hbtq rights , but i believe that adultery has been legalized in both countries . 
  it would be interesting to know what the situation for raped women was in medieval europe and what it was before legalizing adultery in each country . 
  but the fact remains that have already now banned immigration except for certain exceptions , and almost everyone supports this ban . 
  lol , find one ( 1 ) piece of news of a german pensioner freezing to death due to not paying the gas . 
  and with the hourly wage i had in my most recent job i could buy 20 kg of tomatoes . 
  they are already now mostly closed . 
  as ha-joon chang points out in his excellent book , a bus driver in sweden gets $ 14/hour and a bus driver in india $ 0.26 / hour even though the indian bus driver is probably more skillful . 
  this is because moving from india to sweden is banned . 
  and most people that these mostly closed borders are ok , so there is no moral hinders and obviously no legal hinders . 
  that we take refugees has also been always the norm , until recently . 
  the massive criminality has been silenced in all european countries . 
   but not by closing down all the borders of course we could just close the borders . 
  perhaps ideological reasons : as putin is supported by the russians themselves , it 's wrong to kill him and the will of the russians must be respected . 
  russia could also attack the western countries - even though it would eventually lose the war , it could cause massive damage . 
  and , if someone sneaks through , no social security or healthcare at all . 
  passwords does n't have to be especially complex , the password to my e-mail is of the format / / / ng73qx96 / / / and it would take 415 million years to crack it . 
   they deport you right back via europol they do n't , since it would have to be a crime in both countries . 
  it 's enough to move to any of the 31 countries that there is free immigration to from finland and the conscription can be avoided . 
  ( i avoid it myself by not having a finnish citizenship . ), 
  they pay already now . 
  the average wage is about $ 3k to $ 4k in nw europe . 
  the article is worth to read from start to end but here is three interesting details : - only 2 % of swiss said they would stop working due to bi . 
  - a neo liberal think-tank sees that if there has to be redistribution of wealth then bi is the best way to do it . 
  - the median wage in u.s. has rose 2 % from during this century .
