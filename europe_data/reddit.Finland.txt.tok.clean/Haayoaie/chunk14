  other countries that did not participate in the two world wars are n't , however , as rich as switzerland , even though that made probably a country richer and is one factor . 
  you can see in maps from the early 20th century that switzerland is already then the richest country in europe . 
  people develop all kinds of products and services all the time , since they get that way more money than with claiming social benefits . 
  in a communist state selling your products and services is banned . 
  some guy decided to develop angry birds and earns hundreds of millions of euros with it even though he could have claimed $ 1,100 / month social benefits . 
  he would probably developed the game even though he could have been home and lived with a bi of $ 956/month . 
  in a communist country selling the game would be forbidden . 
  this the reason why communist countries fail , but welfare states do n't . 
  communist states fail because no one has incentives to do anything . 
  there is still huge incentives even if a society has bi . 
  that 's true , i added now `` non-acute '' . 
  and the taxes on your wage are increased with the same amount as the bi is . 
  a finnish party calculated that a 42 % to 49 % flat tax is enough the compensate this . 
  currently someone who has the average wage of $ 3315 gets $ 2180 after taxes in the municipality of helsinki . 
  with a 49 % tax rate the net wage would be $ 1691 . 
  when we add a basic income of $ 550 to that it 's $ 2241 . 
  so for example for the average worker the difference with this impossible socialist model would be ** $ 61 ** .

  most european countries stop giving non-acute healthcare and social benefits but otherwise do n't do anything about illegals . 
  it implies only that at least some of the supporters must be ignorant . 
  it 's at the same time possible that everyone not supporting bi is ignorant and of them supporting bi some are ignorant and some are not . 
  unfortunately the average person is mostly interested in grilling barbeque meat , watching football games and reading gossip tabloids than politics .

  it would collapse , but that has n't ever happened in a single country . 
  if everyone refused to work , then bi or social benefits could just be abolished . 
  the problem with healthcare is that so different amounts of it are needed . 
  i visited the doctor 4 times during the last 3 years and could have easily paid all 4 visits out of pocket . 
  my mother was about three months in a hospital and had two surgical operations . 
  the basic income would need to be something like $ 30,000 a year to cover all imaginable healthcare costs , but then it would be ineffective as only a small portion of the population would have so high healthcare costs . 
  that 's the reason why in all civilized countries either the state pays the costs or taking an insurance is mandatory and free for the poor , and the insurance companies ca n't reject customers . 
  however , one intriguing experiment would be that , say , $ 100,000 was handed to everyone when they turn 18 and social benefits would be abolished . 
  then you would have all the responsibility and it would be that had to for example invest the money . 
  interesting in this context is that finland was at the same time the first country to grant suffrage to women in europe . 
  but overall the swiss model seems to be better , when we look at how the swiss bathe in money . 
  or maybe switzerland is so rich due to the direct democracy , and it would be * even richer * if it would be as liberal as finland . 
  that 's actually one thing where many countries , including the nordic countries have kind of a basic income . 
  the healthcare is free even if you work and the taxes are raised with the amount that is used to the healthcare . 
  compared to the model in for example de , nl and ch where you have to pay for your healthcare if you are working , and it 's free if you do n't work . 
  it would completely replace all social benefits . 
  in most european countries there this thing called `` social benefits '' , but people still work . 
  if you look at the statistics , actually people work a bit more in countries with better social benefits since they also tend to be better managed . 
  for example in finland , the maximum cashable amount with bi will be $ 956 and a cleaner 's net wage starts at around $ 1,600 . 
  in most european countries you get already now money for not doing anything . 
  however , with the basic income you have better incentives to work always when you have the possibility to do some work . 
  what the current situation is and what the proposed bi will be like exactly varies country by country , but for example in finland the current effective tax rate for someone working and getting benefits is 80 % and with bi the effective tax rate would fall to 42 % . 
  the current social benefits are just paid as basic income , and workers get the bi but at the same time taxes are raised with the same amount as the bi is . 
  the bi wo n't increase spending on social benefits since they are already a subjective right in finland , meaning that if you simply refuse to work you get still benefits . 
  it should be , however , noted that basic income will be lower in finland than in switzerland . 
  it will be $ 550 and the housing support will remain while the other social benefits are abolished . 
  the housing support is 80 % of the rent , but no more than $ 407 for someone living alone . 
  ( a big mac costs $ 4.10 in finland and $ 5.86 in switzerland , so $ 550 has the same purchasing power as $ 786 in switzerland . ), 
  basic income is most beneficial for young people that sometimes work , sometimes study , sometimes work and study at the same time and sometimes do neither . 
  that 's why discussion forums in all languages are hot about bi . 
  if you are employed or on a pension on a stable basis , then bi does n't matter so much . 
  the caller and the maker of the video could have at least read the wikipedia article first . 
  the idea of basic income is not to make people buy more iphones . 
  both people working and not working get the same amount of money , it 's just distributed in a different , smarter way . 
  is it impossible to understand this with an average iq ? 
  oh my , i 'm a bit scared that finnish politicians are afraid to implement basic income now , and the opponents in finland can claim that if we could vote on the issue a majority would vote against it ( even though a majority supports it , but most people are quite ignorant ) . 
  what is wrong with wanting to preserve those three things and not wanting to have muslims here ? 
  it 's scary to think how the amount of people living in liberal , democratic countries decline slowly , and the amount of people living in conservative or non-democratic countries grow exponentially . 
  bi makes them work more for their income . 
  why should it be means-tested ? 
  bi means just that the taxes will rise with the same amount that the bi is . 
  so even if you are a millionaire it does not matter if you get bi . 
   heavy metal ions in drinking water is this sarcasm or not ? 
  but it 's 10 years in norilsk , which is like in the middle of the most forested place in eurasia . 
  there is probably many places where it is over 9 months if it is as much as 10 years in one city . 
   sounds like hell , i want to visit there . 
  it 's forbidden , lol . 
  but overall the russian part looks suspiciously good in my opinion . 
  murmansk would be less polluted according to this map than for example the 0.3 m city turku in finland , and it would be only moscow that is over 1 year . 
  are the areas in lapland without data due to lack of measurement stations or are they under 1 month ? 
  but if you live close to the sea , then it ruins the experience and you have to travel in order to get to the river . 
  an interesting feature is that the brand of the meatballs and almond cake is s\u00f8derg\u00e5rden in romania and s\u00f6derg\u00e5rden in the nordic countries . 
  \u00d8 is the letter that used only in the nordic countries , but it 's used only in norwegian and danish . 
  so in romania they use \u00f8 to make the connection to the nordic countries , but here in the nordic countries we would see that \u00f8 ca n't be used if it 's supposed to be a swedish name . 
  the meatball packaging has also a typical swedish landscape which the packages here lack . 
  and that 's a good thing since it 's feel so stupid to visit a ikea in finland with `` swedish specialties '' such as lingonberry juice . 
  i 'm really shocked due to the prices . 
  1 kg of meatballs for example costs 4.86 $ in romania and 3.99 $ in finland . 
  the funny thing is that this is an island but it wo n't get an junction since the bridge is so high . 
  but the ones living below will be relocated to other apartments and paid for their current apartments , i read an article about this . 
  it is n't rare that high buildings are banned in historical areas . 
   formally it goes through , but there is just sea on one side . 
  is n't that a problem if you would like to walk by the sea ? 
  there is , and hate speech should be legalized , but in this case at least the review is done by professionals with a long education and experience . 
  when there kind of contracts are done with facebook , twitter and google , the reviewers will not be professional . 
  and the 3 companies can already now remove material , but this agreement hands over more responsibity to them . 
   northern irish citizens can be either british or irish , whichever they choose that 's awesome and could help solving many conflicts !,
