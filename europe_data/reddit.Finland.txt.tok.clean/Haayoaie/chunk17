  i doubt that 72 % of the population has read enough about eu to have an opinion . 
  fun fact : the referenda in 1994 were arranged so that finland held it 's referendum first and in norway last because finns were believed to be the most pro-eu and norwegians the least . 
  it also really was so : 57 % of finns voted for eu , then 52 % of swedes and then 48 % of norwegians . 
  the schedule was carefully planned so that a norwegian no would not have `` ruined '' the swedish and finnish referenda . 
  their amount seem to be quite significant or the eu subsidies are significantly higher for countries with a cold climate and high wage costs , since there is finnish food products available in finnish stores grocery stores . 
   btw how can be sweden no. 1 ? 
  here in slovakia and i know also czech and hungarians are regularly laughing at sweden about their pro-immigration positions so is sweden so popular among germans , brits and so on ? 
  all countries in europe laugh at the swedish immigration policies , but it 's viewed positively for other reasons . 
  it saw for instance itself as the conscience of the world during the cold war which many people who lived during the cold war perhaps still remember . 
  it has also managed to do good pr and has a stronger reputation than the other nordic countries . 
  it makes the poll suspicious that uk is 2nd . 
  in this poll it 's 10th of european countries : http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/07/15/the-worlds-most-reputable-countries-2015/#688af8438023 two reasons i could think of : many nationalists answered the poll and think that uk has balls when it resents eu . 
  or the poll was adverted only in english-language news sites or net forums and users of them view uk more favorably for some reason . 
  otherwise these two polls correlate quite well with each other . 
  the people that china sends are well educated , commit almost no crimes and so on , which probably makes also the country more favorably viewed . 
  i would probably have given a positive vote to slovenia because it has the second-lowest income inequality in the world . 
  but very few people probably know other things about slovenia than that is a small slavic country . 
  yes , but in finland the minimum social security is 36 % of the average wage and the tax rate is higher than in switzerland . 
  maybe we should borrow some swiss politicians ? 
  how can the social benefits be so high and the tax rate so low ? 
  what level is the minimum social security on in switzerland ? 
  it is much less that $ 2,500 , right ? 
  tbh it is extremely difficult to identify the slavic languages . 
  if there would be two czechs in finland discussing with each other i would probably just assume that they are russians . 
  $ 2,500 is way too high . 
  the basic income in the finnish experiment will be $ 550 + 80 % of housing expenses and it 's enough . 
  you can access it with https://wzb.archivz.org/web/20160508113555/http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerland-to-vote-on-universal-basic-income-2016-5 , replace z with e , or with a tor browser . 
  now even poor people can admire the architecture . 
  if it was a fancy restaurant only more wealthy people could enjoy it . 
  social benefits that are given as money are abolished , not free services . 
  basic income has no effect on inflation , since social benefits are abolished at the same time . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  basic income typically means that social benefits are abolished and the basic income replaces them . 
  it 's the same amount of money that is in circulation . 
  this chart is in finnish but should give a good idea about the system : https://www.vihreat.fi/files/liitto/images/screenshot%202014-11-26%2014.19.36.png if for example - your wage is $ 2,000 a month , your net income would be $ 1,740 with this model , - if you would have a part-time job with a $ 1,000 wage your net income would be $ 1,150 - if your wage is $ 3,000 a month , your net income would be $ 2,330 . 
  so you see clearly that there is n't any need to take some money from companies and give it to the citizens and no fears of inflation . 
  the nordic countries lack completely conservative or right-wing parties . 
  the far-right is also not really about conservativism but about immigration and european integration . 
  no , almost no countries have wedding tourism so that people who are not resident in the country can marry under the laws of that country . 
  abortion is banned in liechtenstein and the population overturned a legalization of same-sex marriage in a referendum . 
  these two things suggest there may be problems with the treatment of hbtq people , other than simply the marriage . 
  idk but liechtenstein may be a bit like small villages are , fearing now things and sticking to traditions . 
  they also had indeed a referendum where they gave more power to the monarch . 
  the monarch can even veto all referenda results . 
  how was the statement incorrect ? 
  who knows , maybe a redditor will fix it . 
  :d switzerland has taken part in few wars , it has not joined anything , there is a language that is spoken only in switzerland but it 's too insignificant for the article , it 's not the most extreme country in anything , or the swiss actually have most property per capita in the world but property per capita is not mentioned in the article . 
  i feel myself that the low number is justified otherwise but there should be a mention of the property and the exceptional swiss democracy model . 
  why ? 
  they did n't do anything to the wall and ceiling decorations or the large fresco . 
  why would it be a complete hell ? 
  you ca n't walk in the street holding your same-sex partner 's hand but is that really complete hell ? 
  that 's quite logical , because morocco , lebanon and jordan are not culturally european , but australia has the same culture as europe , it just happens to be not in europe . 
  yes , the central european tourists think it 's interesting when everything is just wilderness , there is 1 m of snow and the aurora borealis , or when in the summer the sun does not set . 
  there is also a huge archipelago area between sweden and finland and a medieval town in gotland , and after that there is nothing interesting in no , se or fi . 
   naaktgeboren ( born in the nude ) lol that must be one of the funniest surnames i 've heard . 
  i believe that he/she knows that the area north of germany and poland is sparsely populated , and then figures out that it must be so empty because it 's full of giant , freezing mountain ranges . 
  and in no-se-fi the most popular areas for tourists outside the capital cities are the mountaineous areas . 
  that 's a valid reason to be confused . 
  i do n't understand why it is so . 
  or , obviously , it 's how people in rich countries view finns , but i thought it 's a fun counterweight to the what x people think of europeans maps . 
  no , you see clearly how ee was poorer than we and only czechoslovakia and the baltic countries were the exceptions . 
  slovenia was n't independent at that time , but perhaps it was somewhat wealthier too . 
   how will the swedish government handle these violent areas as they expand ? 
  by banning sweden democrats . 
  :d i 'm not sure how widespread it is but some politicians of the other parties want just to ban the sweden democrats party . 
  even the french pigs are so civilized that they do n't go aaaaa !!!, 
  my ass !, 
  but just huit !, 
  \u00d6 does not exist in english , but it 's close to the er in hunter or the i in bird .

  a finnish newspaper wrote a short description of the ** second ** largest city of each european country . 
  all the descriptions are at http://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/a1451283268861 and below are some of the most interesting descriptions in english : ** gothenburg , sweden : ** has been a worker town colored by industry and the harbor , but like the second largest city in finland has been since modernized with a higher share of educated inhabitants . 
  has always had many immigrants , mostly living in larger suburbs ruled by the mafia . 
  once upon a time many finns moved to gothenburg . 
  however , they did n't create a mafia . 
  ** bergen , norway : ** one of the most beautiful towns in the world . 
  cute wooden houses in a splendid monuntaineous landscape . 
  in 1990s was the base for church burning heavy metal ( yes , churches were burned ) . 
  ** \u00c5rhus , denmark : ** viewed as redneck , because it 's on the jutland . 
  has , however , many students . 
  ** akureyri , iceland : ** this fishing village may have only 18,000 inhabitants , but it generates a lot of buzz , says lonely planet . 
  ** tartu , estonia : ** was for a long time a closed city because it had important infrastrucure and military facilities . 
  worth to visit , because , well , you can . 
  [ tartu is the university town of estonia with a university founded in the 17th century , but this is something that finns already know . ], 
  ** st. petersburg , russia : ** like paris , but further away than paris for most finns . 
  a hallucination build on a swamp , on bones . 
  petersburgians see themselves as civilized and european , but moscovites know that they have the power . 
  ** geneva , switzerland : ** rich , although z\u00fcrich is even richer . 
  conservative city of not only banks and clocks , but also diplomats . 
  it 's also a base for many subcultures ** birmingham , uk : ** not exactly renowned for its beauty , says the travel guide . 
  ugly cities are fascinating , just as british series , if they are placed in a awful environment . 
  the industrial birmingham has been filled with smoke and everything that the luftwaffe did not destroy has been demolished . 
  ** esch-sur-alzette , luxembourg : ** luxembourg is a giant amoung european microstates , having woods , mountains and 100 municipalities . 
  is an old metal industry town with its worker neighborhoods . 
  the next largest towns are easy to remember : they are differdange , dudelange and p\u00e9tange . 
  ** plovdid , bulgaria : ** many second largest cities are old , but this city is 6,000 years old .
