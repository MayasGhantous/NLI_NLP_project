  they are only valid for a certain time and have fees . 
  bank notes are valid for 15 or 20 years and obviously have no fees . 
   no , stores rarely accept 500s and 200s so they are not useful . 
  all stores accept 500s when the purchase is expensive enough . 
  i have n't ever heard of a store that does not accept a $ 500 bill for a $ 500 purchase . 
  is there climatic reasons so that you ca n't grow potatoes in cyprus ? 
  it actually happened in the viru hotel in tallinn that if the guests considered ordering something , the room service brought the items before they had done the order . 
  i do n't remember , however , if regular citizens from the communist block were allowed the overnight in the hotel . 
  a better way to do so is by demanding a pledge deposit before an asylum is granted . 
  if the refugee returned home the pledge would be given back . 
  this proposition would mean nothing for parasitic refugees , but refugees who would like to work will choose some other country than denmark . 
  i 'm so jealous to you australians . 
  everyone has seen the video , but here is the history : https://youtube.com/watch?v=fqgrc5sfcaq, 
  denmark do n't get bashed much , because young northern europeans have mostly become immigration critics during 2015 . 
  interesting . 
  the newspaper has chosen the wrong way to deal with this , because i tried to google the article but it had been deleted . 
  the newspaper should instead have written to the beginning that he really is 14 , and for clarification that he is not in the same school with the other children in the photograph . 
  the article has went viral because no other articles show these kind of people in school ; for example the facebook post by the prime minister shows the refugees in an asylum center . 
  for those who have n't seen it , here is the swedish pm with refugee children : / stefanlofven/photos/a .649223008451930.1073741832.329885883718979 / 968352329872328 /, 
  that 's what he is saying , although we ca n't be 100 % sure because the stupid swedish journalists do n't ask for evidences . 
  why is that a reason ? 
  i would like the nordic countries and estonia to form their own currency area , and the nordic countries to form their own border control area , but see that just as a that can be negotiated with eu . 
  they are enrolled in normal schools at least in sweden . 
  here is a screenshot of an article with the title `` the fastest 14 years old '' : http://petterssonsblogg.se/2012/02/07/sveriges-snabbaste-14-aring/, 
  refugees should take a photo of an id document and upload it to a cloud service such as google drive . 
  because that 's possible , your ids getting lost or destroyed on your way to europe ( = european countries with high social benefits ) should not be an excuse and such refugees should be returned immediately . 
  i have heard about this before , but what happens if you refuse to pay the taxes ? 
  nothing , but if you would like to get someone from eritrea to sweden or to apply for a passport , its not possible ? 
  it 's also funny how u.s. also taxes its citizens who live abroad , but few people see a problem with that . 
  multi criminals ravage freely , children carrying weapons , drugs are sold openly and masked groups stone police cars . 
  how to describe the swedish police everyday life in some of sweden 's most lawless areas , according to a police report the swedish newspaper aftonbladet has been given access to . 
  entire 52 regions or districts in sweden has ended up on the list of lawless , dangerous and vulnerable places . 
  this information comes from a secret report prepared by the swedish counterpart on kripos , nationella operativa avdelningen . 
  the different areas are divided into three categories : critical areas , risk areas and particularly vulnerable areas . 
  15 areas are placed in the red category as particularly vulnerable , writes aftonbladet , which has been given access to parts of the secret report concerning the stockholm area . 
  \u2022 the police can not do their job : turns alarm on juvenile asylum-seekers : - they steal and take girls between the legs ** stockholm has 20 risk areas ** police have identified 20 critical areas of stockholm . 
  the four worst red-flagged districts in or around the capital 's boroughs are hallunda / norsborg , husby , ronna / geneta / lina and rinkeby / tensta . 
  inhabited by over 75,000 people in the police characterized as delinquent neighborhoods . 
  1,944 of them are registered as convicted . 
  the survey describes areas nearly lawless and where crime takes place openly . 
  they describe subsequently how almost no one dares to testify in criminal cases about what they see and reproduce incidents where police attacked and must run multiple patrol cars when they are called out to these places . 
  \u2022 aftenposten visited s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje : - we all live in the same city , but not in the same world here are examples from the report on crime and lawlessness in neighborhoods and suburbs , as many are characterized by a large immigrant population , high unemployment and poor living conditions : ** hallunda / norsborg ** * older criminals hire 12 or 13 years old minors to carry their weapons on behalf of them , writes the police report . 
  * in a short time last spring about 70 cars and several buildings were set on fire in a confined space , in northern botkyrka . 
  * there are signs that crime also has spread to local decision-makers . 
  the local labor and social welfare bureaus are corrupt . 
  * the police always travel in at least two cars , the other patrol 's task is to guard the first patrol 's police car during missions . 
  ** ronna / geneta / lina ** * residents fear for their lives and because of that do n't talk to police and few dare report the crime . 
  threats and blackmail are a big problem , according to police . 
  * criminals eat at restaurants without paying , drive recklessly on roads and in parks without worrying . 
  acting threatening towards both residents and police . 
  * open drug trafficking and trafficking of contrabands such as alcohol and tobacco , as well as stolen goods . 
  illegal clubs and parties . 
  * police are subjected to stone throwing in geneta centrum . 
  guards alert and thus do police work with drug sales difficult . 
  ** husby ** husby outside stockholm was the site of riots in 2013 , with several car fires and lighted-up homes . 
  * business and other facilities are moving out because of insecurity . 
  * many are reluctant to report the crime and many residents do n't dare to visit the suburb center by just after 5 pm . 
  * drug trafficking occurs openly . 
  * in may last year had a 7 year old boy and a man of 56 years gunshot wounds in connection with a criminal settlement in the central square . 
  * multi criminal gangs in large parts of sweden and its nordic neighbors are operated from here . 
  burnt cars in rinkeby after the uprising in may 2013 . 
  ** rinkeby / tensta ** * there are about 500 multi criminals in the area in loosely assembled gangs . 
  * passers-by have been injured in firearm fights between criminals in public places . 
  * those who do not follow the local rules will be subject to violence , fines and other penalties . 
  * illegal gambling business . 
  contraband goods and stolen goods are openly sold in local stores . 
  * the police have experienced that groups attempt to free caught criminals . 
  always two squads at work in vulnerable areas . 
  * for tactical reasons , the police do not intervene against less serious crimes .

   from the very , very little that i know of this is that `` cultural marxist '' was a legitimate academic term at some point to describe a schism within marxism itself . 
  yes , iirc marxists that wanted to emphasize more social issues than economical issues were cultural marxists . 
  the term has probably been derived from that so that when the soviet union and thus the economic part of marxism fell , the marxists began to have an agenda focused on social issues and thus were all cultural marxists . 
  the term may also have a broad meaning in usa ; in europe it 's used to describe people who have a positive attitude on immigration and radical feminists , or more abstractly , see a race and ethnicity struggle instead of a class struggle . 
  queer is an umbrella term which covers all sexual orientations and preferences that do not fulfill the norms , such as asexuality and intersexuality . 
  i 'm not sure if transvestism also counts there . 
  for some reason i have noted that many english-speakers use lg instead of h , which is a bit weird when h covers both and the lg distinction is problematic when someone is neither a woman or a man . 
  the latter may be the reason why hbtq is much more popular in the nordic countries than lgbtq . 
  homosexual , bisexual , transgender and queer, 
  the term marxism is sometimes also used for opinions that the ex-marxists have . 
  the ones who were marxists during the cold war tend now to be so called `` cultural marxists '' , that is , praise immigration and see a race and ethnicity struggle instead of a class struggle . 
   the thing is - you just ca n't make gypsies work . 
  it 's impossible . 
  if you think i 'm being racist or wrong - you can ask other bulgarians . 
  that 's true , few of the gypsies in finland work . 
  many other problems can , however , be avoided . 
  for instance if roma people do n't send their children to school they will be taken with force from the parents . 
  it 's because jews are rich and behave well , which causes them to be below muslims in the post-marxist hierarchy . 
  similarily , if there is a conflict between muslims and hbtq people , the new left backs up muslims against hbtq people , because hbtq people are more `` privileged '' than muslims . 
   finland has the second highest amount of guns per capita as swizerland has a bit more . 
  it depends on the definition . 
  switzerland has more guns if guns that belong to the military but are stored in private homes are counted in the statistics ( 45 per 100 ) . 
  without those guns ( 25 per 100 ) finland has the most guns in europe ( 34 per 100 ) . 
  it 's difficult to know whether something is really happening in poland or not , because journalists usually praise immigration and thus they want to paint all far-right governments as evil . 
  based on this discussion thread it seems like nothing is happening in poland and it 's just about this `` far-right is evil '' thing . 
  am i right ? 
   no , finns are average drinkers in the eu . 
  they may be , but there more alcoholics in finland than most other european countries . 
  you can see that just by walking on a street . 
  when the youth populations were compared , only danes drunk more than finns , but for some reason the danes do n't become alcoholics .
