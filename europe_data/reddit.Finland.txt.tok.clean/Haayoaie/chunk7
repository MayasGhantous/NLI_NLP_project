  i wonder why people that do n't fulfill the whiteness norm murder much more than people fulfilling the whiteness norm in usa , but not in sweden . 
  does poverty , lack of social security and lack of opportunities cause the murders and something else the rapes ( sweden is infamous for its rapes , but has less murders than u.s. ) ? 
  no , it has always been high . 
  it 's the combination of : * finland has most firearms per capita in europe * booze drinking and alcoholism are more common in finland than in most other european countries * finns use also nearly the most drugs in europe , see this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42gd7y/drug_use_by_city_in_europe/, 
  why not then copy-paste it ? 
  how can it be so difficult to write k\u00f8benhavn instead of kobenhavn ? 
  it 's really disturbing when the \u00f8 is o. 
  the public transport in athens must be awesome because 67 % are satisfied with it . 
  is a lot of money poured on it or is there some secret ? 
  the gold stealers get $ 4089 a month , the wage you refer to is the wage in liechtenstein . 
  a political compass with 3 dimensions works already well : * left - right * liberal - conservative * nationalist - politically correct, 
  yes , although it 's best to emphasize that this applies to the real far-right , not the pc `` far-right '' getting 25 % of votes . 
  other arab countries . 
  i use cultural marxists to distuingsh them from their predecessors , who instead of immigration praised economic marxism , that is , communism . 
  in 1991 capitalists won and this time immigration-critics will win and immigration will eventually be halted . 
   not true ? 
  as someone who was born and raised in a poor family , i can guarantee you that being poor has nil , zero , nothing to do with being a sex offender . 
  it has a little bit . 
  in finland refugees rape 17 times more than finns , and 13 times more after correction after sociodemographic factors . 
  so the difference between 1 and 13 , 1200 % , comes from cultural factors , and the difference between 13 and 17 , about 30 % , from poverty , education , neighborhood and also demographic factors . 
  the new left seems honestly to think that only the latter things cause difference , but this is of course neither true . 
   thirdly , i do n't have issue believing young antillean and surinamese rotterdams are overrepresented but i also have the feeling ( i need the stats to back it up ) that they are on average more likely to be in lower income areas and those generally have higher crime rates regardless of ethnicity or religion . 
  no , see my other post . 
   now , it is worth remembering that huge chunk of people that came are still refugees from war-torn regions . 
  somehow in all of this we have forgotten about that . 
  we have n't forgotten that , they should just move to places that fit better culturally . 
  lol , who gets than paid less in u.s. ? 
  it has to be someone , because the average wage is about the same in both countries ? 
  yes , the bell curve is different is u.s. and europe , and also between countries within europe . 
  an american software engineer makes $ 90k and for example a train driver makes $ 50k in finland , which would probably be something completely different in u.s. 
  why ? 
  this seems to be true , paintings with half-naked women have really been moved from the parliament house . 
  it 's probably part of the neo-conservative movement in sweden which has also for instance banned prostitution in sweden . 
  ( the conservatives are called liberals in sweden and vice versa . ), 
  it 's really amazing how many words have been changed or altered a lot in either indo-european or germanic languages , but they have stayed the same in finnish , like aut ( i ) o  autio . 
  a good example for germanic languages is kuningaz , which in finnish became kuninga ** s ** , but in english it has evolved into king . 
  of course it is , the pro-immigration media wants you to believe that you ca n't be against immigration if you are liberal . 
  what a stupid argument . 
  no societal reforms can ever be made with that attitude . 
  in 1945 you would have said that there ca n't be any social security or else it will end up in forfeiture of the rich people 's assets , in 1965 you would have said that legalizing homosexuality will lead to legalizing pedophilia , else the requirements of the liberal lobby will never be met . 
  thank you , this was interesting and useful . 
  56,594 km2 , do you have room to lay down or do you have to stand all the time ? 
  that 's true , and this is also something that 's easily recognizable , so i do n't see a problem . 
  vandalism that is a real problem would be something like changing the area of slovenia to 1 km2 . 
  i know that you can buy european citizenships , but i still wonder what would happen if someone just had more assets than the cost of the asylum process is and still sought asylum instead of buying a citizenship . 
  it could be for instance so that the russian billionaire has n't the time to buy a citizenship . 
  even the actual law text is n't clear :  '' endvidere kan aktiver , der kan anvendes til d\u00e6kning af de i \u00a7 42 a , stk . 
  many ordinary finns move from sweden to finland to avoid problems caused by the immigration , while many new left elite swedes move from finland to sweden because they get more attention and admire there . 
  big government is not the problem , since the tax rate is about the same in the nordic countries and cuba . 
  this is almost like a conspiracy : do not sentence ( or murder ) people that criticize immigration , but harass them . 
  let them freely talk about the harassment and admit the harassment . 
  it likes a plot how to make people turn against immigrants . 
  people who criticize immigration are labeled as stormfront people in this thread . 
  no , because people harassing immigration critics are good people . 
  i wonder when there has been political tensions like this in europe the last time . 
  half of the population believe that nazis are on the rise and refugees will be persecuted , and half of the population that an authoritarian left is on the rise and they will be persecuted . 
  there does n't have to be any evidence . 
  it 's enough that russian media spreads claims and then many russians living in estonia will believe it . 
  it also erodes internal stability and trust in the government when a certain part of the population will believe that the results are partly made-up . 
  i would not myself trust the swedish elections if they were electronic . 
  that 's because dubious things are already happenings there now . 
  there is a paper ballot for each party and mysteriously the ballots for the anti-immigration party either runs out or are placed in a different location than the other ballots . 
  yes , exactly . 
  when there is a paper ballot system , fraud is almost impossible in countries like estonia . 
  in an electronic system , the citizens just have to trust on the system . 
  if for instance a hostile country start to allege that fraud has been committed , there is nothing you can do except than say that no , no fraud has been committed . 
  typically it 's the new left that screams `` nazi !!! '', 
  when someone is opposed to taking refugees . 
  which is really funny because the difference between refugees and ** real ** nazis is small . 
  charts of alcohol consumption do n't work well , because the consumption is different depending on the part of europe . 
  norwegians drink the least , but binge drink more than the average european . 
  do you new left people really think that there is only people praising immigration and national socialists ? 
  or is it propaganda to make people think that i do n't want to be a nazi , thus i have to praise immigration ? 
  frankfurt has not participated in the study , so there is still hope . 
  the cocaine use in frankfurt may be almost as high as in london . 
   small countries with very dense cities then the use of drugs in finland must be [ excessive ] ( http://arkisto.eralehti.fi/files/library/images/kartta575.gif ) . 
  opiates can not be distinguished from another in the sewage water , like morphin ca n't be distinguished from heroine . 
  i do n't think medical use has to do with it . 
  i first thought i would write england , uk and catalonia , spain , but then i thought that everyone know where england and catalonia are . 
  yes , the measurement they use is mg / 1000 inhabitants . 
  on the other hand utrecht and eindhoven use 80 % less cannabis , on the other hand they are 6th and 7th , respectively . 
  a map of alcoholism would also be interesting . 
  the youth drink the most in denmark , finland and sweden , where about 40 % of 15-year-olds had been drunk during the last month . 
  however , i ca n't find any statistics of alcoholism by country . 
  finland seems to be the only country that tops both alcohol use amongst youth and drug use . 
  no opiates are included for some reason . 
   we put in a petition system not to long ago , it resulted in some gems being debated in parliament including `` ban donald trump from entering the uk '' , `` stop allowing immigrants into the uk '' and `` vote of no confidence in the health secretary '' . 
  weird , petitions in finland have been always quite reasonable . 
  some of the latest petitions : * a referendum should be held on exiting the eurozone * same-sex marriage ( was passed ) * more lax equirements for energy certificates of houses ( was passed ) * banning of fur industry * harder punishments for drunk drivers * harder punishments for child molesters i believe that it would be about the same if these were referendum initiatives and there was a referendum on all of these issues . 
  the same-sex marriage law was passed in 2015 , and it could have been passed much earlier by a referendum . 
   police usually put ethnicities in press releases , but local news often omit them . 
  this is often the thing also in finland . 
  in one piece of news it was described that the robber was black and the bag was black . 
  both the robber being black and the bag being black were omitted in local news . 
  schizophrenically there is still many news about how criminal the immigrants are . 
  the swiss voted against a higher minimum wage and longer vacations , so its difficult to see how people would be swayed by populist ideas . 
  although switzerland is the best country in the world , the swiss are n't so much of a master race that for instance scandinavians , germans and canadians could not handle a direct democracy . 
  i remember reading that swiss will have the right to obtain all the data that has been collected about them with the surveillance system . 
  the swiss authorities would be obligated to hand over the information immediately after the `` project '' with a certain person is over . 
  they know that , but when you are granted lifetime $ 1,100 per month payments once you have reached europe , the mediterranean sea and border controls are more of a manlihood test .
