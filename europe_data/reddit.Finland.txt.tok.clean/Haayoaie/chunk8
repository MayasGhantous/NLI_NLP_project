  i do n't really understand this complaining about social benefits . 
  it was not easy to find them but when i finally found what the rules are in finland , it turned out that you have to live in finland for five ( 5 ) years before you can get social benefits . 
  refugees , ethnic finns and people who have a connection to finland are generally exempt . 
  if you view it so that those are human rights , then the human rights were already in place before any treaties . 
  but anyway , if human right treaties were thrown away out of the window , the situation would be the same except refugees would not be taken . 
  amount of somalis in each province : http://pxnet2.stat.fi/pxweb/sq/dd9e85b4-17a3-4930-8fda-06cef6d6e845, 
  in the area where 8 % are white british , can you walk there safely as a woman at 3 am ? 
  the 80 % is what the * yleinen asumistuki * pays , and its maximum rent is about 500 euros in the municipality of helsinki . 
  * toimeentulotuki * pays 100 % and its long-time cap is 650 euros . 
  the very vast majority of refugees live in areas with so expensive rents . 
  so this is the minimum amount of social benefits after the asylum has been granted . 
  how the minimum amount of social security is calculated is complicated , but for someone who is living alone the amount is 485 $ , the maximum rent that can be paid varies by municipality and is 650 $ in the municipality of helsinki , and on top of that things like visits to a doctor , medication and utility bills are paid . 
  so if you would live in helsinki , have the maximum rent and $ 20 of utility bills that month you would get $ 1,155 of social benefits . 
  i mean , once the asylum has been granted . 
  those amounts are correct when the claim is being processed . 
  europe was the same before this `` human rights '' thing . 
  for instance in finland freedom of speech was granted in 1776 , the death penalty abolished in 1825 and universal suffrage introduced in 1906 without any human right treaties that demand to take refugees . 
  i do n't see why anything would happen if human rights were thrown out of the window . 
  so the man had applied for asylum 20 times in 7 different countries , but had he been given any asylums ? 
  applying asylum for many times is probably quite common . 
  in finland an unaccompanied refugee children had committed an armed robbery of cannabis and was prosecuted for attempted murder . 
  it turned out that the unaccompanied refugee children had been living in sweden since 2007 and was , in fact , 25 years old . 
  however , it would be interesting to know what is likelihood to actually get many identities . 
  this is so true !, 
  if i would move to iran and go through a course where it 's teached that the women 's place is children , kitchen and the mosque , and hbtq people must be reported to the police , would i then act like what i was told in the class ? 
  it makes things even worse that most of the believes refugees hold are based on religion . 
  from the viewpoint of an iranian everything is allowed in europe . 
  there is freedom of speech , you can have sex without any limits , even buy sex and so on . 
  usually only things that hurt other people , cannabis and euthanasia are banned in europe . 
  and every refugee is paid $ 1,100 a month without conditions in finland , so life is already relatively good even if you do n't work . 
  edit : some people thought this the amount when the asylum claim is being processed . 
  this is the amount after the asylum has been granted . 
  refugees have the right to work once they have been granted asylum . 
  it depends . 
  with that mindset it 's not possible to get a western wife , but i believe an arab will easily swallow those requirements . 
  that 's true , although in my opinion human rights should be abandoned so that europe can take less or none refugees . 
  the price is the same in all eurozone countries . 
  finland do have gypsies , and they lived a nomadic life still in the 1940s . 
  after that different measures were taken to end that . 
  the gypsies in finland are prone to crime , but live in normal housing in normal areas and attend normal schools . 
  some gypsies refuse to enroll their children in schools . 
  in that case the children are forcefully taken away from the parents . 
  i do n't think that a large british party would want to nationalize banks and important industries . 
  they want perhaps to nationalize some narrow branches that they see as natural monopolies , like railroads , but it 's hard to believe that claim when even the most radical nordic parties do n't think like that . 
  obviously you can , because the only gypsies begging in finland are from romania . 
  how can you let even children to live like that ? 
  why do n't you do anything to help these people ? 
  what a depressing place . 
  is it kemi ? 
  how can you buy anything from abroad or visit other countries when the wages are so low ? 
  or even buy something from stores like h&m which have uniform pricing in all countries ? 
  most young people in finland vote either the greens , which is a liberal party wanting to legalize things like cannabis and euthanasia , or the finns , which is the anti-immigration / nationalist party in finland . 
  the right-wing europhilic party get also votes . 
  the attitude of the media has an impact on how young people vote : the anti-immigration party is the most popular party in denmark amongst young people , while in sweden only 8 % voted the anti-immigration party and 32 % voted parties which demand that there has to be free immigration . 
  the first stair hall is probably a so called servant stairwell . 
  servants used to have their own stair halls when there was the class society , and they typically looked something like that . 
  castles may also have two stair halls like that . 
   s&p btw was only agency to rate as so low . 
  s&p gives often lower a bit lower rankings . 
  austria and finland are ranked as aa by s&p and aaa by fitch and moody 's . 
  that 's the good part of being a densely populated country . 
  due to [ this ] ( http://arkisto.eralehti.fi/files/library/images/kartta575.gif ) , neither the state , municipalities or provinces care about urban sprawl in finland . 
  building permissions for houses are given regardless of the place , while at least according to my dutch friend that would not come into question in nl . 
  as i said , most gypsies in finland do n't care about the society , but there is ** some ** gypsies that want to work , study and integrate to the society . 
  i know personally such finnish gypsies . 
  if there are n't ** any ** gypsies in the balkans that want to work and study , something is wrong with the social politics . 
  i would actually say that most of balkan , including bucharest and sofia have an ideal climate : there is still snow every winter , but the winter is not as cold as in southern finland . 
  due to the more continental climate summers are much drier than southern finland , and somewhat warmer , but not too warm . 
  average temperatures of 21 and 22 degrees celsius with 300 sunshine hours sounds like an ideal july for me . 
  what a stupid party . 
  britons , please bear in mind that citizens of other european countries are not entitled to social benefits . 
  it 's not going to happen that all the muslims would want to move to uk , but if they would really like to move to uk , they have to get jobs or have assets . 
  what i know of dutch : dutch insults are awesome . 
  they include often kanker or mongool , sometimes even both . 
   kazimierz is not ghetto , lol . 
  interestingly , ghetto meant originally the neighborhoods in europe were jews were concentrated , not neighborhoods that are poor and with all kinds of minorities . 
   laagland interesting , this is like 100 years old danish or norwegian . 
  do you pronounce it with a or o , as it is pronounced in the scandinavian languages ? 
  it 's a bit more complicated . 
  sweden has had for a long time the most extreme immigration policy in the world , while in w europe only denmark/danes has had a more critical attitude towards immigration than finland/finns . 
  finns are generally chocked about the swedish immigration policy and its consequences . 
  the description indeed says that geneva is conservative . 
  it also says that it 's a base for many subcultures . 
  perhaps it 's best that i add that to the op . 
  are you sure ? 
  i remember at least reading articles that state that in s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje even restaurant keepers must pay `` protection money '' for the mafia ( consisting of the evil immigrants ) . 
  i believe most people living in the gothenburgian suburbs or s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje do n't notice anything special in their daily lives . 
  the article has a relaxed tone , which perhaps does n't make it 's way to op . 
  by being viewed as redneck , the author perhaps means being viewed as redneck by the inhabitants of copenhagen . 
   this simply means there is no solidified form for this type of declension ( btw . 
  conjugation is used for verbs ) , or that there is variation or that a change is happening . 
  it 's actually none of these three , it 's just that there are n't other nouns with the same pattern as koko , so native speakers do n't know how the declension works . 
  there is a solidified form so that when native speakers are told how the declension works they start to use it . 
  finnish is just so complex that adult finns learn new grammatical rules for spoken finnish the same way as < 5 years old germanic language speakers learn new rules for spoken germanic languages . 
  well , when it 's for instance the national day in sweden , newspapers are full of articles disparaging sweden and telling why you should not celebrate the national day . 
  example : http://touch.metro.se/metro-debatt/nationalstaten-ar-ingenting-att-fira/evhoff!bmviuzcgdo5hg/, 
  but what if a gypsy would want to climb on the social ladder and is named roleks binladen ? 
  most gypsies in finland do n't care about the society , but there is some gypsies that want to work , study and integrate to the society . 
  yes , it does . 
  one example could be the word `` koko '' , which means size .
