that 's gon na be my wedding song , no joke . 
  [ screw all of you guys :( ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ymwizjv.jpg ), 
  man if i posted every song i hate there would be no room for the other categories !, 
  thank you for taking your time to show these . 
  that 's a pretty extensive list . 
  i also appreciate that you took the time to write why they are popular, 
  domestic as in stuff from your country . 
  you understood me correctly . 
  and probably fistfulls of other drugs, 
  [ gabber piet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dckuttegjoq ) is from the jolly 90 's . 
  when gabber and happy hardcore reigned supreme . 
  i was being sarcastic when i said it was the coolest , but i would be lying if me and some of my friends have n't had fun listening to [ campy dutch music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmyi5u9bhti ) . 
  i think gabber piet is the coolest thing to ever come out of the netherlands, 
  these are just five examples though , and i tried to vary what i put there . 
  luckily someone else from my country could ( and hopefully does ) post their own list with their own subjective taste of what should go in those boxes . 
  now that 's an extensive list, 
  these lists are entirely subjective . 
  infact i hope several people from the same countries post their own lists because it 's fun to see and hear edit : spelling, 
  thank you !, 
  your personal favorite was so cool . 
  and that last one was hilarious to someone who has never been exposed to it before . 
  that 's an interesting map . 
  thank you for sharing, 
  something old : [ leevi & the leavings - teuvo maanteiden kuningas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yca0bdxykao ) something cool : [ gracias feat .

  i 'll just order these ferry tickets and be on my way . 
  hope the customs do n't take my katanas, 
  that sounds lovely . 
  agreed . 
  i guess so . 
  but i want visitation rights, 
  you can have everything below sk\u00f6vde, 
  ca n't understand a word they say am i right ? 
  * shut up !, 
  * you 'll ruin everything, 
  he did n't specify by how much but he 's technically right . 
  in the same way i can say there are more than ** twelve thousand ** people living in india, 
  there was a pun to be made and i squandered the opportunity . 
  forgive me, 
  i do n't know but i 've been told !, 
  * insert what you thought here *, 
  my daughter said `` mmm ! '', 
  the first time she got a sisu and she 's loved it ever since, 
  there are two official finnish ways to die . 
  falling asleep in the snow 2 . 
  drowning on midsummers eve * edit : spelling *, 
  august this year was nice . 
  but when two thirds , especially the main vacation season , was cold , then that 's what you 'll remember, 
  yeah . 
  this is from june 2014 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqc7wo7veke you never know what you 're gon na get . 
  snow and +30 in the same season . 
  compare the end of july 2014 http://climatevo.com/2014-07,helsinki,fi, 
  while the rest of europe was suffering a greater heatwave the nordic countries were stuck in cold weather . 
  2015 june & july http://m.accuweather.com/en/fi/helsinki/133328/june-weather/133328 http://m.accuweather.com/en/fi/helsinki/133328/month/133328?monyr=7/01/2015, 
  no do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm very happy with the autumn weather . 
  it was nice to look at from the window at work . 
  i just wish it had been that way when i was free, 
  like this year . 
  we had three hot days this summer . 
  i counted . 
  that 's why i do n't watch it . 
  i could n't handle the embarrassment of accidentally speaking in public . 
  i did say * if * my math is correct, 
  yes , if my math is correct . 
  but even that 's actually happened like . . 4 times, 
  black & white is one of my all time favourites . 
  wish it got remade . . 
  it even digitally released somewhere, 
  * sweating profusely *, 
  paradox is the proof that swedes and finns can work together !, 
  ( cities : skylines ), 
  we drink so much coffee in finland and as a swedish speaking finn ( ca n't speak for finnish and sweden because i do n't know if it 's true in their case ) the word `` melittap\u00e5sar '' ( melitta bags ) is basically synonymous with coffee filter, 
  but sweden also invented notch so we can forgive this transgression, 
   ddt i love that game, 
  melitta is the patron saint of finland, 
  thank you for that . 
  i play it often as i can but it 's almost harvesting season, 
  oh no worries i suspected that would happen . 
  but there are some good answers here too !, 
  of course we do . 
  we also say sibula and tulinen vai maito . 
  but only as a joke . 
  basically every pizzeria in porvoo has a variant of it . 
  someone wanted kebab rangalaisilla on his pizza and it took off from there, 
  salad , mayo , fries and kebab strips on salami pizza . 
  my favorite growing up . 
  just like in one of my portuguese animes !, 
  i heard the danish word for penis is `` elskep\u00f8lse '', 
  i secretly hope that every time i leave a winter party drunk . 
  it 's one of two official ways to go here ( premeditated suicide is cheating ), 
  hoas thinks it 's warm enough if there 's no ice indoors, 
  okay . 
  mustard it is !, 
  if the sauna is full it 's cheek to cheek time , in my experience . 
  and nobody minds . 
  after all , ca n't be standing in the sauna, 
  dude that means they * paid * for it, 
  new contender for most stolen sign , i 'm sure, 
  i always viewed the map of the nordics as norway and finland hugging over sweden,
