  i just want a common language to be used , and english is good solution for that . 
  sure , uk gets advantage from that . 
  there are other problems in eu to be solved too , and some of those solutions will be in the advantage of other countries . 
  we all need to aim for the best solutions and accept that sometimes we are n't the ones benefiting most . 
  it 's in everybody 's interest . 
  america 2 , what are you talking about ?? 
  that 's a weird argument and has nothing to do with why we actually support english as the natural common language for eu . 
  we simply want to solve problems like this in a cost effective , pragmatic way . 
  if most of europe already spoke french , i would support french . 
  same way with german , italian , spanish or heck even estonian . 
  hebrew had strong unifying cultural , religious and national meaning for the israelis , so it was sort of a logical choice for them . 
  for us europeans there is no such easy card to play , so it 's best to pick the most pragmatic one we have available - english . 
  but i suppose esperanto would be logical in the sense that it would be the most euish way to do things . 
  expensive , impractical , byrocratic and incompatible with anything already existing just to make things ` fair ' for everybody included . 
  english is a very practical choice . 
  it 's already the de facto language spoken globally and it 's taught pretty much in every european country . 
  it just makes a lot of pragmatic sense to use it . 
  esperanto would be complete waste of time and resources . 
  unfortunately when you are dealing with russia , politics will be involved whether you want it or not . 
  putin does n't care about business or image , will use these nuclear plants as a way to have leverage on every chance he gets . 
  `` war of aggression '' . 
  globalresearch.ca < 3, 
  it might be only me , but i only managed to watch like 6 minutes or so . 
  i do n't ** at all ** like where russia is going at the moment , but that film actually felt like it was made in kremlin to make it look like western world is purposefully going after russia . 
  you know , over-dramatic tones and music , weird facts ( like war is going to happen in 2020 ) , super cool graphics to gather attention , bad eastern accent ... 
  painful to watch , and i 'm even drunk at the moment . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  they dig pretty deep into facts there and give actual sources to their claims . 
  you know , stuff that a good journalist would do , unlike the crap that gets done in rt and sputnik . 
  your `` personal right not to be filmed '' does not extend to your neighborhood . 
  and even if it somehow miraculously did , you still would have zero right to use violence . 
  people like the ones in the clip are dangerous thugs , no better than far right nutters , who need to be put into jail to protect the society . 
  most likely so , but at least we make russia pay through it 's nose for it , so it will think twice before pulling crap like that again . 
  defend the necessity of sanctions ? 
  i would n't forget so easily that russia is ** our ** neighbor and that ** we ** are n't in nato . 
  if russia keeps on it 's aggressive ways , it could very well be us who are next in line . 
  if we are n't ready to help ukraine with sanctions , then how can we expect any help ourselves if shit hits the fan ? 
  what ? 
  eu countries are the biggest losers if russia continues it 's aggressive ways towards it 's neighbors . 
  ukraine is right in our backyard . 
  what has this to do with washington ? 
  we are trying to build a unified european juggernaut , by europeans , for europeans . 
  and kremlin is trying to shatter that idea so that they can drag eastern europe back to their ` loving ' embrace . 
  she does have that ellen ripley kind of vibe . 
  i would n't want to mess with her , that 's for sure !, 
  russian border controls have before kept most of refugees from crossing to the finnish border . 
  they used to play nice and not let people come through who did n't have valid visas . 
  lately this changed completely . 
  russian officials are saying they are just following european human right treaties , which is funny considering things like that have never prevented them before . 
  they are also not accepting the refugees back , saying that they lied to the russians when getting their paper to come to russia , so they have no valid reason to accept their return . 
  we finns know they are doing this just to mess with us so we would drop the sanctions against them . 
  but it 's not happening . 
  if anything , this is just making us dislike russian government even more and i would personally back up even harsher sanctions . 
  it russian holy land and need one port in americas !, 
  it only geopolitics logical making and always russian sphere of influence . 
  why you fascisting this ? 
  this . 
  we finns would have zero problems with russia if they acted like our other neighbours . 
  do n't threaten us with your military . 
  respect treaties . 
  respect borders . 
  have rule of law . 
  be polite . 
  it 's all common sense , but with russia things just do n't work that way . 
  finland is n't a jingoist country . 
  only way for it to happen would be if there was a petition from karelia to join us . 
  comrade , are we still supposed to say ` best performing currency of 2015 ' ? 
   what exactly , is added , except for the obligation of nato to come help finland ? 
  frankly , i do n't understand your logic . 
  to me it seems like you actually deliberately want to weaken nato by making standards so high that they are unrealistic . 
  are baltics also just dead weight that should be kicked out from nato , because they certainly ca n't do anything else than just to protect their own countries , if even that ? 
  their position is so vulnerable anyway , that they are actually making war with russia more likely . 
  perhaps denmark and norway should be ditched too , surely they do n't bring much to table ? 
  you are forgetting a simple fact . 
  more men , tanks and planes means more power to nato . 
  more power makes a war less likely , because it means that russia will be less likely to ever attack . 
  it also buys time for other nato countries behind the first one that russia has to attack . 
  this . 
  just a couple of years ago people would have laughed at someone who suggested that ukraine was going to end up attacked by russia . 
  i 'll rather play it safe than risk being in the same boat with ukraine and georgia . 
  even with 1.4 % of gdp , nato will be stronger with finland ( and sweden ) as it 's members . 
  we are n't a big nation , but we have conscription unlike many other countries in europe . 
  this means that there are hundreds of thousands men in finland who already are trained to use weapons and to work together as a team . 
  additionally our position is strategically important for the protection of the baltics , and we work as an important buffer to buy time before russians can get to norway . 
  edit : also due the way the costs of conscription are calculated , it could be argued that we are in effect paying much more than 1.4 % of gdp . 
  russia can go fuck itself . 
  this is none of their business . 
  that being said , alliance with sweden is n't really the best option . 
  we should finally stop pretending and join nato like we should have done a long time ago . 
  military alliance with sweden is n't going to as strong or as dependable as required to actually provide protection from russia . 
  nato is . 
  nato was a good choice for norway , denmark , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland ... we would be in good company . 
  unfortunately yes , due the after effects of finlandization . 
  people still want to believe that if they just keep up good relationships and trade going with russia , then hopefully nothing bad will happen . 
  also our politicians are weak willed weasels without any backbone , so they wo n't take the lead on the matter either . 
  georgia and ukraine should have taught us something , but alas it does n't seem to be so . 
  as a fin , let me tell you . 
  being russia 's neighbor sucks balls . 
  if russia ever decides to get aggressive with us ** again ** , we 're in big trouble . 
  as long as soviet union existed , we were under constant threat which we only evaded by the process of `` finlandization '' which made our politics heavily influenced by russia .
