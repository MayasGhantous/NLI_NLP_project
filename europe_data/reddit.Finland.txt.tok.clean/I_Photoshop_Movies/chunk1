  and certainly better than uk . 
  in usa english is 80 % . . 
  yeah stockholm - helsinki is the ultimate booze cruise, 
  finnish is the best `` maa '' - earth + `` ilma '' - air = maailma, 
  that 's the difference in scandinavia . 
  you do n't need a full time job to live on your own . 
  i moved out when i turned 20 and my parents gave me no pressure .

  false . 
  stats are not comparable . 
  false . 
  boom . 
  burned . 
  the reason why sweden has such a high `` reported '' rape rate is because : they modified the rape definition to include many things and so that one rape can count as a 100 , 1000 , etc ... `` reports '' in the statistic whereas in most countries it would just count as one report `` so , for instance , when a woman comes to the police and she says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year , the police have to record each of these events , which might be more than 300 events .
