  the reported rape rate relies heavily on the rate of reporting , a country 's laws , and is easy to falsely report ... so it is a very unreliable statistic you ca n't falsely report a murder like how you can falsely report a rape ... . the murder rate in sweden is lower than all 50 us states ... the us state with the lowest murder rate in 2012 had a murder rate of 1.1 per 100,000 whereas sweden 's murder rate in 2012 was 0.7 per 100,000 . 
  i wonder what the reported rape rate of us state with the very lowest murder rate would be if they had sweden 's rape laws and rate of reporting .

  people falsely reporting homicides in sweden or inaccurate estimates ? 
  too bad you ca n't falsely report a murder like how anyone can falsely report a rape ... steig larsson says : `` there were 230 homicides in sweden in 2009 , compared with 143 in washington , d.c. , which has a population a bit more than half sweden 's size . 
  but compare these figures to what they were in the years when sweden looked like a utopia . '' but where do such numbers come from ? 
  the unodc says there were 87 homicides in sweden in 2009 [ data ] ( https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/data.html ) and sweden 's population size is 9.5 million compared to around 660,000 for dc ... no real comparison . 
  this means sweden has a lower murder count than dc even though sweden 's population is nearly 9 million higher than dc 's ( 14 times higher ) . 
  sweden is very nationalist and racist so of course i think that they would falsely report rapes or report non-whites more often for non-violent rapes no one would really care about these non-violent rapes with no injuries or whatever if white males were accused so it 's more of a racism issue ... like the wikileaks co-founder ( white male ) was accused of rape in sweden but whites just dismissed it as a result of sweden 's rape laws ... had he been non-white the story would 've been `` brutal gruesome rape '' he probably would 've gotten at least 2 years in jail, 
  it 's not an epidemic . 
  the reason why sweden has such a high `` reported '' rape rate is because : they modified the rape definition to include many things and so that one rape can count as a 100 , 1000 , etc ... `` reports '' in the statistic whereas in most countries it would just count as one report `` so , for instance , when a woman comes to the police and she says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year , the police have to record each of these events , which might be more than 300 events .
