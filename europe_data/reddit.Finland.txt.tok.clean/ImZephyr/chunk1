finland 's not going to be `` wealthy '' for long if our politicians keep fucking up as much as they 've fucked up recently ... 
  people who are offended by stunts like this are a lost cause and can not be changed anyway . 
  because people who run this country are delusional and think we 're `` neutral '' . 
  we do n't even have an army , we have the `` defence forces '' . 
  well he can only blame himself . 
  whenever some stupid politician says that something should be banned in finland you can be sure a shitstorm will rise and much of trolling will emerge . 
  do n't tell us what to do , or else . 
  [ the infamous `` viskigate '' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/hs_finnish_officials_ban_the_word_whisky_on_private_blog/7523995 ), 
  eurovision has always been about the message rather than the music . 
  during the cold war songs were about atomic bombs and shit . 
  if you honestly think eurovision is a singing contest you need a reality check . 
  it is n't . 
  they won . 
  luckily the cheesy put-together boyband came second . 
  no , not softengine . 
  some band called `` satin circus '' . 
  never heard of them , but teen girls were going crazy . 
  how reliable is this source ? 
  ** finland : ** we 're not shy . 
  we 're just very insecure about about our skill in english even though we 're one of the best in the world . 
  it 's some weird perfectionism that we have . 
  we have to get it 100 % right or else we 've failed miserably . 
  maybe it 's because of the way we are taught english in schools . 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/finns_top-notch_in_english_skills/7934886 also not talking much is not rude in finnish culture . 
  it 's the complete opposite . 
  same goes for personal space . 
  in finland it is respectful to mind your own business . 
  i do n't know you , sir . 
  i do n't want to smell your minty breath while you small talk about the weather . 
  the weather is always bad in finland . 
  too hot , too cold , too much snow , not enough snow , windy , rainy , too dark , too bright . 
  always bad . 
  hey !, 
  there 's plenty of fields in osthrobotnia . 
  plenty !, 
  eh ... what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the kkk idiot is all over the news ... 
   multiculturalism is a richness  - alexander stubb , former prime minister and current minister of finance . 
  is n't every culture equal ? 
  all the australians i 've met have been loud as fuck . 
  they 'd never integrate imto finnish society . 
  i 'm sure you can pay someone if you want to harm yourself . 
  it was paid with golden spray-painted bricks . 
  and you will never find your way out !, 
  nobody leaves !, 
  yeah , that 's the problem . 
  i 've spend some time abroad . 
  it 's difficult to approach different people when there 's plenty of people with the same background around you . 
  i remember reading about some young immigrant ( somalian i believe ) telling that he wanted to learn finnish together with finnish people because you 'll learn more . 
  he also befriended finnish people to integrate better . 
  well good thing we are letting them all live in the same street corner so they can form their own little community . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  bikes and pot everywhere . 
  how many people should come before we panic ? 
  we just need to look at the us and see that multiculturalism is n't just daisies and daffodils even after hundreds of years . 
  [ every time it spots a biker it says `` vroom vroom motherfucker '' and accelerates . 
  murheellisten laulujen maa ( land of sorrowul songs ) http://lyricstranslate.com/en/murheellisten-laulujen-maa-land-sorrowful-songs.html, 
  we were never invaded by the vikings . 
  but most likely it 's because she 's not allowed by the community to remove it . 
  just recently a middle eastern guy plotted to kill his sister , because she was hanging around with her finnish friends late at night . 
  she was `` bringing shame to her family '' . 
  it 's not uncommon for muslims to think like this . 
  i saw an arab wearing a turban and an adidas jacket on top of his robe . 
  he was at least trying . 
  they also complained that cigarettes and other stuff is expensive . 
  lol , for the first time ever i 'm glad everything is so damn expensive . 
  by publishing propaganda as well ? 
  wow , journalism . 
  lol , 80 000 . 
  we ca n't even afford 30 000 . 
  we 're collapsing . 
  it 's all that baguette, 
  more children drowning , more people dying because of human trafficking , i 've heard rumours refugee children have been lost in sweden now so now they 're in the hands of criminal organizations probably . 
  oh the stupidity of humanity . 
  it was the plan all along !, 
  no they 're not . 
  iraqis are coming to finland now because sweden will sent them back to iraq . 
  both sweden and denmark say somalia is safe . 
  one our ministers , pekka haavisto , just visited mogadishu a few days ago . 
  if the country is in such a chaos how is this even possible ? 
  they 're having a elections next year . 
  how is it functioning if it 's so `` dangerous '' ? 
  this is n't showing people coming over the border from sweden to finland . 
  sweden is shipping them via trains and it 's getting ridiculous ... 
  no , because in their eyes isis is not islam . 
  ask the feminists . 
  and giant enemy crabs . 
  we do n't live in the middle east . 
  or murica . 
  we already have a protest tomorrow because of cuts the government is doing, 
  she been squatting for sure . 
  god ca n't take credit . 
   mecha hitler wolfenstein ? 
  that 's ... actually quite pathetic ... 
  converts are the craziest . 
  now that i think of it ... hitler did nothing wrong . 
  it has happened before plenty of times . 
  `` the only good thing that comes from france is french fries . '',
