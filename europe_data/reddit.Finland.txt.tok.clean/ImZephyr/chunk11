  lol . 
  bill clinton himself was proudly tougher on crime than republicans . 
  that does n't make sense since these groups started off because the mainstream media was hiding stuff and painting a pretty picture of utopian society created with multiculturalism . 
  when the media and the police finally admitted that okay there are `` some '' problems the fuse ignited . 
  the media lied , the cops lied , the politicians lied . 
  who can you trust anymore after that ? 
  it seems inevitable , yes . 
  the bigger it grows the more radical it could get . 
  they have n't bashed anyone yet though . 
  i do n't like them , but they 're done nothing wrong at least for now . 
  you ca n't direct link naurunappula .

  yeah , it 's more like [ self-censorship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-censorship ) . 
  government is n't enforcing it , but the media is censoring itself trying to create a bubble . 
  the government on the other hand is shunning the people with opposite opinion ( sd ) and the cops are also not reporting stuff because it would indicate that sd actually has a point . 
  and they will be poor and unemployed so they will have more offspring . 
  and there 's more coming . 
  pretty much . 
  testing their age is `` insulting '' according to the bleeding hearts .

  people do dislike estonian construction workers , because they work for lower wage which is still many times bigger than in estonia . 
  they live in shitty shared apartments and then take all the money with them to estonia . 
  they 're taking advantage of the system , so really the problem lies in the system . 
  same goes for polish construction workers too . 
  finland also pays child support if at least one parent of a child works in finland .
