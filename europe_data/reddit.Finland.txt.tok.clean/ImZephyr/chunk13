  we european nations have our separate cultures and histories that go much deeper than your states .

  yeah . 
  you have cops raping women . 
  reminds me how mannerheim was told not to smoke when hitler was visiting him during his birthday because hitler hated cigarette smoke . 
  what did he do ? 
  lit a fucking cigar and blew smoke into his face . 
  hitler did n't do nothing cause he was so desperate for finland 's aid against the soviets .

   crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist 's urine apparently named ` piss christ ' , lmao !, 
  apparently it was destroyed though by a vandal .

  second row , last column ... is that messi !? 
  you do n't draw the face of god !,

  i 've only been in denmark anyway , its cool . 
  i guess in a certain way because of history , but i would n't call it patriotism . 
  i feel more close towards our nordic brethren than other europeans though , thats for sure . 
   as a leafs fan i 'm so sorry :(, 
  citizen of finland . 
  lol , citizen of europe ... 
  i feel no `` patriotism '' towards europe . 
  when things get hard it 's every country for themselves . 
  there 's no `` united europe '' . 
  then we have our former culture and sports minister who was so drunk he was carried to his room by some of our hockey players after he had partied with them after winning bronze in socchi .

  as an atheist i dislike these guys way more than many religious people ... 
   all rapes in europe are always done by immigrants said no one ever . 
  not surprised idiots like you have completely missed the point of the criticism . 
  i prefer `` black russia '' . 
  i prefer not mixing alcohol into my milk , thank you very much . 
  same in finland . 
  it 's a shame . 
  i only have like one friend left from grade school / high school and my university friends are scattered all over finland . 
  that 's what you get for being born in a small town . 
  i 'm moving to a bigger city , but gon na be hard to get new friends .
