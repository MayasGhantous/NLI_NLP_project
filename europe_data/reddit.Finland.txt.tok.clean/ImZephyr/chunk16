  but cats are assholes ... oh no !, 
  he read my text !, 
  not for us ... 
  we should broadcast some finnish movies to poor countries . 
  well it 's not much of a mountain to begin with . 
  about 2000m , not that much really . 
  do n't be stupid . 
  he was never a zombie . 
  he fled to the moon . 
  wow , that 's actually pretty bad ... 
  they hate us cause they ai n't us https://youtube.com/watch?v=3rnflqavk8u, 
  it 's not irish . 
  it 's not english . 
  it 's ... well ... it 's just pikey . 
  i call bullsit at least in finland . 
  they move to cities , for example helsinki that is expensive as fuck compared to rest of finland . 
  they 've suddenly gone pretty quiet . 
  and the media in finland has stopped hiding at least some facts . 
  it was just recently in the news that many refugees have committed or are suspected of committing rape or sexual abuse in finland . 
   they 're very conservative compared to other scandinavian/western european countries compared to sweden ? 
  i 'm glad . 
  beautiful :'), 
  oil would make things much smoother, 
  well the thing is ... they 're not refugees . 
  do n't you that cops are fascists to them as well ? 
  some iraqi refugee said in an interview in finland that many come here just for tourism . 
  also 40 % of iraq refugees have canceled their application for various reasons . 
   that being said , and this need to be said , her party also caters to a certain electorate that is definitely extremist . 
  well if there 's no other party that fits their agenda then obviously they 're backing the one that suits them . 
   with the eu already becoming an `` ever closer union '' and heading towards full on federalisation ( which is fantastic ) pfft . 
  why not laugh at both ? 
  reminds me of sigurd the mighty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigurd_eysteinsson#sigurd.27s_howe, 
  however ... easter ? 
  what do we even do on easter ? 
  nothing . 
  except the kids . 
  i 'd say independence day is more celebrated . 
  when dozens of finnish people celebrate by drowning themselves in rivers and lakes , 
  i heard they have casinos, 
  that 's cute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_kale, 
  horses ? 
  here if you see a black mercedes-benz with dark tinted windows you know it 's gypsies . 
  it does n't fucking work !, 
  carry on . 
  was there seamen involved in it ? 
  so you say ... 
  good luck with that in here . 
   begging on the streets of finland for 5 years there 's been plenty of talks to make begging illegal in finland since most beggars are just gypsies who beg for organized crime . 
  besides people in finland rarely give money to beggars because of that reason so it would be quite pointless . 
  also living in the streets and begging wo n't make you a citizen no matter how long you do it . 
  greece you dirty pedo !, 
  do we look so young ? 
  \\* blushes *, 
  `` have a good day at school , dear . 
  and do n't forget your shield . 
  remember . 
  come back with it -- or on it ! '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2121/did-spartan-mothers-really-tell-their-sons-with-your-shield-or-on-it, 
  it 's a natural thing to do . 
  it 's a way to release stress and other feelings . 
  forcing yourself not to cry will only bottle up negative feelings . 
  same thing if you 're feeling angry it helps to punch a wall or something . 
  not saying you have to cry , but it does help most people . 
  also is n't the point of a screensaver that it 's actually moving ? 
  a static image would burn into the screen . 
  well , i 'm not sure if that 's the case in modern computers though . 
  [ so do they !, 
  yeah , sure . 
  we will also gas them and make some soap . 
  i do n't trust him . 
  he looks like he 's plotting to kill some hobbits . 
  spinkle some dolans on him , johnson, 
  an art even ? 
  yes .

  here 's a good article imo http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/10682975/the-jews-who-fought-for-hitler-we-did-not-help-the-germans.-we-had-a-common-enemy.html, 
  lmao !, 
  opened the link . 
  there 's lights on it 's horns . 
  thought it was fire haha !, 
  so why are these bastards rioting ? 
  but do n't you know we became one with the neanderthals . 
  so it 's all okay ( \u0361o \u035c\u0296 \u0361o ), 
  careful what you wish for . 
  you might accidentally subscribe for daily bear facts . 
  the original name for bears in finnish is ` ohto ' ( otso ) , but it was not used because it was thought that saying it 's true name would attract bears and anger them . 
  many animals in finnish had a real name and an euphemism . 
  for example fox was really ` repo ' , but ` kettu ' was used instead . 
  therefore the word ` karhu ' ( karhea = rough , because of it 's fur ) was used for bears . 
  sometimes even ` h\u00e4n ' ( he ) or even ` ukko ' ( old man ) was used as bears were considered divine in some way . 
  bears were also considered to be very close to humans . 
  eating bear flesh was considered cannibalism in some parts of karelia all the way to the 20th century . 
  finnish people also worshipped bears by hunting one and and mourning it 's death during ` karhunpeijaiset ' while the bears soul was an honourable guest until it returned to the sky into it 's rightful place as the son of a god . 
  the bears skull was hanged on a tree so it was closer to home . 
  just a fun fact . 
  bears are badass . 
  you still got ta respect them .
