  how is it any different from `` hunting '' moose ? 
  are you fucking dumb ? 
  let me answer that : yes . 
  yes it fucking is . 
   and yeah christians did go on crusades , 700 years ago . 
  before people knew the earth was round . 
  just fyi people knew earth was round since ancient greece . 
  it 's a myth that columbus was the one to find out the truth . 
  irrelevant , as you said , it 's a thing of the past . 
  we moved on . 
  everybody ha-ates ~ ~ chris ~ ~ germans !, 
  why does ronaldo hate messi ? 
  competition . 
  it 's fucked up and our culture used to be like this , but a very very long time ago . 
  middle east is n't as culturally developed , but there 's some hope in countries like iran whose people have started to protest for lgbt-rights and feminism . 
  making jokes about a bearded guy without getting kill ... oh wait ... 
  palin will soon see them from alaska . 
  there are no jokes in africa . 
  [ i prefer this solution ] ( http://files.explosm.net/comics/rob/remains.png ), 
  that kicking was disgusting . 
  and i think femen does more harm than good . 
  they really think they 're gon na change the mind of someone by acting like baboons ? 
  they really think someone will go `` wait a minute ... these half-naked screaming women are right , i should n't abuse women !, 
  oh my god !, 
  what an enlightment ! '', 
  does [ this ] ( http://www.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/putin-femen_ap.jpg ) look like the face of intelligent thought ? 
  he 's gone bankrupt like 5 times . 
  the only reason he 's making money currently is by selling his name for companies to put on the front of their skyscrapers . 
  his name is n't going to last forever though . 
  and putin wo n't be very popular when russia 's economy collapses . 
  but i thought the christians in us are oppressed !, 
  to be fair ... that 's the only solution now . 
  the whole situation could of been stopped other ways , but nobody gave a shit . 
  `` not our problem '' . 
  close enough . 
  the other one makes jokes , the other one is a joke . 
  more will drown if europe does n't stop this madness . 
  europe is run by smugglers . 
  pathetic . 
  til iran is in europe . 
  where is linda !, 
  [ roman schatz ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_schatz ) - german-born author and journalist . 
  became popular for appearing in educational tv-shows were he taught the german language to finns and how to behave in finland for foreigners . 
  [ keith `` keke '' armstrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keith_armstrong_ ( footballer \\ ) ) - former british football player who came to finland after newcastle loaned him to oulu . 
  he has also and still is coaching finnish football teams . 
  but he became popular as a commentator . 
  alexei eremenko jr and roman eremenko - soviet-born football players who play for finland 's national team . 
  very crucial part of our team . 
  popular because they 're great in football and play for finland and that is a great way to enter a finnish man 's heart . 
  anu saagim - former estonian model who married the son of the founders of marimekko . 
  recently known more for insulting finnish women and other bitchiness . 
  i personally think she 's a cunt and does n't paint a great picture of estonian women . 
  and this is why the white race will die . 
  because nobody else gives a shit about this multicultural agenda bullshit . 
  middle east for arabs , asia for asians , europe for everyone ?? 
  is the white guilt burning you people so much ? 
  yle is so fucking left-wing ... 
  what does that even mean ? 
  they do n't go to russia because isis ? 
  and the whole country is n't in chaos like syria . 
  comparing anything that is happening now in europe to the holocaust is idiotic . 
  this comparison is extremely disrespectful . 
  yet it seems to be very popular ... 
  just yesterday i sat in the train next to an indian guy and i had no problem . 
  i 've given my seat to a muslim woman who had two children . 
  no problem . 
  i 'm no fucking racist . 
  i however feel islam is a threat . 
  it 's not their skin color . 
  it 's their culture and their values . 
  it 's the fact that we ( western world ) as a society have developed a lot thanks to feminism and secularism and such . 
  we have gay rights , we have equal rights between sexes . 
  same can not be said about the middle eastern countries . 
  and most people are molded by the rules of one 's country . 
  it 's not the norm , but it 's a serious threat . 
  and is really completely out of the question that maybe ... you know ... just maybe the average muslim is more racist than the average european ? 
  they 've been living in a monoculture far longer than we have . 
  [ bbc panorama : british schools , islamic rules ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urh6ev5rrmu ) [ bbc panorama - muslim first british second ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzjwaioqfqw ), 
  * yes . 
  nationalists are getting stronger and more violent , anti-semitism will rise , even the refugees hate different branches of islam . 
  there are no jobs in here . 
  how are we going to integrate them when there is no jobs ? 
  * i would n't be surprised if they hate gays . 
  do i believe they 're as crazy as isis ? 
  no , but there are huge problems in islam . 
  but why does the left-wing media only show pictures of little children ? 
  i want to be realistic . 
  a lot of bad people are coming as well . 
  again ... islam . 
  also studies show certain cultures are more prone to crime , because of different moral code . 
  not going to judge a single individual , but i 'm honestly concerned we wo n't be able to integrate people that well . 
  at least in finland we 're running out of money and and people who are capable of helping these people to integrate ... * for now 6 % . 
  the problem is more and more are coming . 
  and this is only the start . 
  imagine when climate change gets even worse and people from africa start migrating here ... * i guess . 
  but it 's still disrespectful to ignore borders and pass countries just for better benefits . 
  i blame eu though for this . 
  luckily finland is thinking of cutting benefits from refugees among other things ... also stop this moralizing !, 
  people have been starving in africa for ages and you never gave a shit !, 
  how can you be so inhumane ! '',
