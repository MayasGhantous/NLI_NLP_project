  valyrian is not based on any language . 
  in fact the creator of the language was disappointed that grr martin used dracarys to mean dragonfire as it 's too latin . 
  [ someone will ] ( http://replygif.net/i/1485.gif ), 
   it shows how far behind greece is culturally , compared to the rest of europe . 
  oh the irony . 
  this is still happening . 
  tourists say that when they get a receipt in restaurants , for example , the sum is much lower than what they actually paid . 
  restaurants get the money , but pay less taxes ... 
  divide et impera , 
  it 's krating daeng in thailand and it 's slightly different cause mateschitz changed the taste of it to suit westerners better .

  no = ei also `` jaa '' as `` yes '' is used in the parliament , because [ back in the day when finland did n't even exist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diet_of_finland ) votes were cast by shouting and swedish was the language that was used . 
  in swedish `` yes '' is `` ja '' and `` no '' is `` nej '' . 
  when finland started using finnish officially in the parliament the word `` jaa '' remained since it was easier to shout `` jaa '' than `` kyll\u00e4 '' . 
  obviously people do n't shout their votes in the parliament anymore , but [ the word still remains ] ( http://verkkouutisetfi.s3.amazonaws.com/6565e5d613694f2c40841364b50cc2a7d7e90e19cd5c2b94013a4fb85cd62e82 ) .

  she does n't live there anymore since she got a lot of backlash after the mh17 was shot down . 
  even though nobody even knows what she looks like . 
  so i 'm sure putin approves this message . 
  well women can make their own channel with half naked men . 
  hollywood is already doing it with fifty shades of grey and magic mike . 
  those are basically soft porn for women , but nobody is batting an eye when it 's men who are objectified , 
  `` women should be allowed to do what they want . 
  do n't do porn !, 
  do n't be a swimsuit model !, 
  do n't show your body !, 
  do n't be a stay-at-home mother ! '', 
  feminist logic . 
  we have a crazy feminazi in finland whose said that women who sleep with men are traitors to their gender ... 
  i 've seen the magic mike xxl ad like 5 times already today while watching tv ... oh i just wonder what would happen if a movie ad about female strippers would play during commercial breaks ...

  fyi 65 % of women have a slightly bigger left breast . 
  but i guess you 've only seen tits in porn , 
  lol , did n't some isis soldier have aids and he donated blood to the soldiers ? 
  they found out and killed him , but there 's probably many more isis soldiers with aids now . 
  also some other diseases are spreading among them . 
  there was a flesh eating virus spreading in the islamic state like two months ago . 
  so yes , they are infact killing each other . 
  like yet another terrorist attack in france ? 
  a pissed off little kid playing cod is a bigger threat that north korea .

  that 's how i 've always heard it used . 
  it 's always meant to me that something has changed forever , therefore `` this is the first day of the rest of your life '' . 
  similar to `` life goes on '' . 
  but while `` life goes on '' is usually used after something bad has happened `` today is the first ... '' can be used when something good has happened too . 
  like having a baby . 
  not sure how things are in other parts of europe , but in finland it 's not that unusual that connections fail and paying via card does not work . 
  i guess things are better in denmark . 
  i 'm in . 
  glory to bacchus !,

  well , except for the welsh obviously . 
  do you really think giving a 500 $ fine to a rich guy is going to change his attitude ? 
  no , it 's not a punishment for him . 
  on the other hand for a poorer guy it 's a big thing . 
  this is the equal solution . 
   i do n't see the problem with that . 
  and that 's your problem . 
  i would perform an artistic dance and piss on it . 
  it 's art , right ? 
  freedom of speech . 
   the consequent notion that it 's wrong to judge another 's way of life finland must not be northern european then . 
  in the us : `` he was reaching for my gun . 
  i had to shoot him . '', 
  and i would n't blame him . 
  i hope that clears the air .

  does n't darker roast have a stronger taste ? 
  we finns drink like 90 % light roast . 
  light roast does have more caffeine than dark roast , because longer roasting means less caffeine .
