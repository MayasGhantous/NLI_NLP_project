although not as badly as in 2012 : https://youtube.com/watch?v=gvtuhkfo95m, 
  it 's quite an assault that homeros becomes homer in english . 
  homer sounds so banal . 
  yes . 
  the nordic countries have n't produced especially much culture , and have been rather uncivilized . 
  but h. c. andersen is the one who wrote for example the fairytale about the ugly duck that becomes a beautiful swan , and linn\u00e9 created the fauna and flora taxonomy and their scientific names . 
  a quite large majority seem to hate . 
  for example in my hometown the neighborhood where most of the buildings are from the 18th century was clearly seen as the most beautiful according to a poll . 
  the 2nd most beautiful neighborhoods where the ones where most buildings are from the 19th century , and in the ugliest neighborhoods were all post-1960 . 
  the oldest neighborhood was something like 4.7 / 5 according to the poll and the ugliest 1.9 / 5 . 
  everyone hates architecture designed after 1950 , it has nothing to do with this sub . 
   people seem to think that the swedish media is the worst in the world swedish media must to be the worst in the western world . 
  was n't there even a case where they hacked into a public web forum and harassed immigration critics , even publishing the name of some immigration critics in their newspapers ? 
  swedish media must to be the worst in the western world . 
  was n't there even a case where they hacked into a public web forum and harassed immigration critics , even publishing the name of some immigration critics in their newspapers ? 
  the finnish media is biased in most topics , although it 's not easy to see it if you agree with the bias . 
  if you read carefully the reporting of same-sex marriage and eu , you 'll also notice a severe bias . 
  this bias just does n't personally bother me , because i 'm pro-hbtq and pro-eu , but i notice it clearly every time i open the newspaper and read about those topics . 
  and what do you mean `` one of you people to pop up '' , do you think we are some kind of special people . 
  we immigration critics are just normal people and everywhere . 
   and don \u00b4 t bother answering , i am disabling the inbox in this comment our inboxes are always open since we can also defend us with rational arguments unlike you open and tolerant people who can use only emotional arguments and the r word to defend your thesis . 
  i do n't know if i should be worried now but the telegraph and the guardian feel very neutral compared to finnish and other nordic media . 
  and i would n't say that the economist is a specialist newspaper , it has all imaginable societal matters covered and lacks only things like sports or lifestyle . 
  it 's also imho the medium of the highest quality in the world . 
  2nd and 3rd could be perhaps npr and bbc . 
  a man was shot by the police after he had driven the vehicle out of the road and was threating a passenger with a weapon . 
  this is the 2nd time in 2016 when someone was shot by the police . 
  the social benefits of refugees are lowered to $ 1,037 / month . 
  to be more precise , the neo-nazi kicked the victim one time , and the victim died because of that single kick . 
  the crime is currently not investigated as a murder , but as a negligent homicide . 
  as usual , nothing happens here . 
  there were protests due to a neo-nazi accidentally murdering someone on the street . 
  about 15,000 people participated in them . 
  a juice bar was problematized from the gender perspective . 
  it 's investigated whether it discriminates women or ugly men . 
   i was racking my brain `` maybe they mean it can travel with the rotation of the earth and keep the same relative position to the sun ? '', 
  in soviet russia , you do n't travel - the earth travels below you . 
  the fighters did not have transponders as usual , and flew 1.8 km below the aircraft . 
  nato staff alerted the pilot . 
   according to mbl.is , nato monitored the bombers , which flew almost all the way to spain , where they turned around and flew back to russia . 
  i first thought it must be a bit exhausting to fly russia - iceland - spain - russia without breaks , until i read this :  they are capable of carrying nuclear weapons and can travel beyond the speed of light . 
  this sub is full of leftists , if you have n't noticed it yet . 
  italy is a country where corruption is rampant and the southern part is poor . 
  italy is not sweden - without immigration native swedes would have not formed gangs . 
  i ca n't remember at all any gang-related shootings in helsinki , not even one . 
  and even if you would find one or two shootings , they are still significantly less than the tens of shooting in sweden every year . 
  yeah , so 3 wars where both had nuclear weapons and 1 where a nuclear country was attacked by a non-nuclear . 
  it 's interesting to speculate then whether there had more wars if nuclear weapons had not been invented . 
  probably yes . 
  and while there has been also wars between ** democracies ** , such as when uk , canada , australia and nz declared war on finland , they are also relatively rare . 
  yes . 
  so while you do n't get a punishment for it , the crime rate becomes low and that 's why it 's accepted . 
  people think more about the crime rate than revenge . 
  this is because the justice system is not seen as a means of punishment , but as a means of rehabilitation . 
  so usually the rapist would talk with a kind , understanding psychologist or social worker about his life and get punished only if he for example commits another crime during the probation time ( 2/3 of the rapists are sentenced to probation ) or commits later another rape . 
  the amount of rapes and pedophilia seems to be more biology-driven and is the same as in uk , germany or usa . 
  the overall crime rate is extremely low due to the rehabilitation approach and the welfare state . 
  a good example of the low criminality could be that the police needs to fire only 5 shots a year . 
  i do n't think they do , because the crime rate is at the same time extremely low due to the welfare state and a rehabilitation approach instead of a punitive approach . 
  a good example of the low criminality could be that the police needs to fire only 5 shots a year . 
  the average time spent in prison for murder is 12 years , so on average the punishments are somewhat higher . 
  the danish/swedish stereotype in a collection of stereotypes is always meant to represent the whole nordic countries . 
  so the stereotype will include lustful blondes , heavy metal , saunas , reindeer & santa claus , the northern lights , vikings , ikea furniture , poul henningsen lamps , meatballs , socialists , or whatever , but is meant to represent the whole region . 
  for some reason denmark or sweden is just picked as the country instead of nordic countries . 
  he dragged himself to the entrance of a nearby store and died in the entrance . 
  so it was a murder , and the juvenile had to sit in prison 3 years for the murder . 
  the most typical sentence for rape in finland is 0 years - the majority of offenders are not sentenced to prison for rape . 
  the sentences in u.s. seem so weird . 
  i mean , the median sentence for rape in finland is actually not 2 or 1 years , but 0 years , since only 1/3 of rapists are sentenced to prison . 
   just like no country on earth with nuclear weapons will be attacked ... . 
  there has been even at least two wars where ** both ** of the countries had nuclear weapons . 
  and 5 years is actually a long sentence for rape . 
  as a comparison a gypsy who had decided to stab a random person on the street was sentenced to 8 years , of which even that person will sit 1/2 , or to be more precise 1/3 because he was a juvenile . 
  so they must have used a lot of violence or the rape must have lasted for a long time . 
   intelligent tax system yes , it 's an intelligence tax system . 
  at least the 3 nordic wages were all true . 
  they do really have generally . 
  the north is always better than south in both subjective surveys and objective rankings such as rankings by corruption : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index or press freedom : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index . 
  there could be more people in larger cities that are forced to live there because of studies and work , while people living in the countryside might typically do so because they really like it . 
  `` i-v '' is definitely the best system and should be used everywhere . 
  but names not based on the order perhaps gives some information about the life before , such as l\u00f6rdag being the bath day . 
  the month names in finnish are n't just named after some roman caesars and thus bear some information : november is for example the month of death . 
  it 's the same in finnish : are you germanic ? 
  are you finno-ugric ? 
  and this is my opinion weird , because you could think that these two words are so fundamental and often used that they would not change . 
  does this mean that she got a lot of personal votes even though the voters did n't know at all what kind of political opinions she have ? 
  mr was she positioned at the top of the list and did n't need to get any personal votes . 
  the system in norway and sweden is in my opinion btw weird because the political parties can always get some people chosen by placing them on the top . 
  in the finnish system there is no order and the candidates are chosen exclusively according to the amount of votes each candidate got . 
  eu subsidies are only 5 % of the romanian gdp , so they do n't matter . 
  they matter only , according to at least my logic , if the romanian state would not have spent money on something , because it feels it 's not worth it , but eu decide to spend money on it . 
  but in that case the romanian state could still have done the some thing very well , for example if these buildings were painted with eu money the state would still have afforded the painting . 
  the significance of those is over-exaggerated , since even at most a country gets $ 500 / year / inhabitant from eu . 
  that neighborhood looks better when walking in it , though . 
  but perhaps a bit too kitschy . 
  in architecture everything was better in the past , and this color scheme for example is perfect : http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/13878/normal_dsc_0092_edit2.jpg each house has a different color , there is only one color in each house , but there may be 2 or 3 slightly different versions of it and the color is a pastel color . 
  the differently colored parts are very harmonous such as in the first building on the right side . 
  the starting point was better and the environment ok , but this house in helsinki ( in the worst area in the city ) started also to look way more interesting after a simple renovation : before : https://www.google.com/maps/@60.2156259,25.0817258,3a,75y,13.79h,91.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slervtmoxhxkq8jt0hc6afa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 after : http://www.hekaoy.fi/puotila/sites/puotila/files/styles/gallery-medium/public/kiinteisto/image-gallery/2013-11/korsholmantie9_puotila2.jpg?itok=fecax7tn i do n't understand why commie houses are n't painted and decorated more often . 
   calling for reunification with ... austria , and of course the recovery of silesia , pomerania , east prussia and the s\u00fcdtyrol are these some kind of taboos ? 
  i 'd assume that the latter is more efficient , since in the latter both will know all the words , unless you misunderstand the meaning of a word or pronounce it wrong , but in the first one there could be a word that the other person does know .
