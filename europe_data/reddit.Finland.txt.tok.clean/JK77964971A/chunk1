keeping russia busy ... 
  or baltic sea . 
  i would n't call it phobia , it is a normal reaction towards the world biggest ( area ) country who openly start annexing other countries , or parts of it , see : crimea/ukraine . 
  the east-europeans remember very well the iron curtain and the oppression from soviet union ( russia ) . 
  cold war was a hell , people lived in constant fear of a nuclear holocaust and now russia / putin is targeting those countries again to get them into russia 's `` control '' or influence . 
  they have even a geopolitical plan for that , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics  the foundations of geopolitics : the geopolitical future of russia is a geopolitical book by ** alexander dugin ** . 
  the book has had a large influence within the russian military , police , and statist foreign policy elites [ 1 ] and is used as a textbook in the general staff academy of russian military . 
  [ 1 ]  the book was co-authored by general nikolai klokotov of the general staff academy . 
  [ 1 ] colonel general leonid ivashov , head of the international department of the russian ministry of defence , apparently advised in the project . 
  [ 1 ] klotov stated that in the future the book would `` serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command . '', 
  some examples :  romania , macedonia , `` serbian bosnia '' and greece - `` orthodox collectivist east '' - will unite with the `` moscow the third rome '' and reject the `` rational-individualistic west '' . 
  [ 1 ]  ukraine should be annexed by russia because `` ukraine as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible . 
  [ 1 ]  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  [ 1 ] i understand very well that after reading that stuff many people will start to rethink russia . 
  that book is not far from declaring a war . 
  and the actions in ukraine are strongly pointing that putin is ready to use military power against its smaller neighbors . 
  and all this just right after the winter olympics . 
  the contrast ca n't be bigger than that . 
  edit , forget the link , add it . 
  russia does n't tell pro-russians to not use force in southeast ukraine . 
  ^ this ^ game ^ is ^ absurd ... 
  ah , yes , soviet union citizens . 
  that was different , estonians who were fighting with finland were not soviet citizens . 
  finns warn estonians and estonians knew themselves too that it was better to get out from finland , because soviet union won and went all the way to germany . 
  and took also estonia . 
  so they flee to sweden , usa etc. 
  estonians were in reality fighting also with themselves : there were estonian troops in the red army and in the german army . 
  and in finnish army ...  in december 1941 , estonian national units were assembled from the men arriving in russia ; by september 1942 , they were joined into the red army 8th estonian rifle corps . 
  in the autumn , the corps consisted of approximately 30,000 men , 85-90 % of whom were estonian . 
  http://www.estonica.org/en/the_estonian_soldiers_in_world_war_ii_in_three_different_uniforms/ but there was also finnish troops in the red army , many finns escaped to russia/ussr after civil war 1916 . 
  hard lessons about independence and war . 
  for both countries . 
  that last `` light news '' was unnecessary . 
  makes you look like a `` persu '' ( basic finn - party member ) . 
  we have much , much more serious problems ahead than that . 
  like the russian nuclear power plant . 
  should we take it ? 
  russia is the only country who wants to build it . 
  france and areva gave it up : they ca n't even get ready the olkiluoto 3 reactor , it is years late . 
  in this situation it is a huge risk . 
  oh , and that `` muslim women police '' - thing was also almost a april joke , `` wtf-who cares '' kinda story . 
  young people do n't give a fuck about that kinda shit , nor the `` spring-hymn '' news . 
  makes me wonder that how old a you and what 's your agenda ? 
  to make finland look like an ass ? 
  source ? 
  because i 'm from finland and never heard about `` large numbers of estonians deported '' to ussr . 
  instead :  however , many nationalist men found it unacceptable to fight against the soviet union for germany . 
  they tried to find a third way , fleeing to finland to avoid the german mobilisation and joining the army there . 
  escapes increased in spring 1943 , when secret mobilisations into the german army started . 
  in february 1944 , the estonian volunteers formed the 200th infantry regiment in the finnish army ( jr 200 ) , with about 2000 men ; about 400 estonians additionally served in the finnish navy . 
  in august 1944 , most of them ( the finnish boys ) returned home , invited by nationalist circles in order to fight the approaching red army . 
  http://www.estonica.org/en/the_estonian_soldiers_in_world_war_ii_in_three_different_uniforms/ of course finland had to give up all war prisoners and defectors and i heard that in these shipments were also people from karelia , baltics etc. 
  and that finns helped some of those to escape and flee ( away from finland ) . 
  but what numbers are you talking about ? 
   no references to `` creative freedom '' and `` national distinctiveness '' can justify the behavior that is considered unacceptable from the standpoint of traditional russian values . 
  this is interesting , icon of the ivan the terrible : http://i.imgur.com/rtoq15d.jpg  on march 2 , 2010 in the presence of russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy a russian art exhibition , holy russia , was opened in the louvre ...  the general sponsors of the event were gazprom , gdf suez and total . 
  http://www.gazprom.com/social/supporting-cultural-projects/louvre/ * on that page is a much better icon ( 5mb . jpg ) of ivan the terrible . 
  *  [ ivan terrible ] ... his long reign saw the conquest of the khanates of kazan , astrakhan , and siberia , transforming russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state spanning almost one billion acres , approximately 4,046,856 km2 ( 1,562,500 sq mi ) . 
  [ 2 ] ivan managed countless changes in the progression from a medieval state to an empire and emerging regional power , and became the first ruler to be crowned as tsar of all the russias . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible also ...  ivan [ terrible ] successfully cemented autocracy and a centralized government and thereby also `` a centralized apparatus of political control in the form of his own guard . 
  '' [ 45 ] the idea of a guard as a means of political control became so ingrained in russian history that it can be traced to peter the great , vladimir lenin , who '' ... [ provided ] russian autocracy with its communist incarnation '' , and joseph stalin , who '' [ placed ] the political police over the party . '', 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible#legacy ... and this : russian novelist erofeyev : stalin is 'em bedded in our genes ' http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/novelist-victor-erofeyev-says-stalin-in-genes-of-russia-a-921597.html  erofeyev : stalin has embedded himself in our genes . 
  he tries again and again to rise from the dead . 
  please do n't forget that the best were killed after the october revolution in 1917 : the best aristocrats , the best of the bourgeoisie , the best officers , the best farmers -- even the best workers . 
  we , including myself , are merely the best remnants of the inferior leftovers . 
  a nation with these genes is susceptible to stalin . 
  stalin has also left his mark on my genes . 
  are these thoughts any worth ? 
  we have had two `` leaked '' phone calls here in europe , the first major one was the nulands `` f ** k eu '' call and the second one was where estonian minister said that there might be a possibility that in kiev there was snipers who shot anybody . 
  these affected quite much in europe and made public confused . 
  and the source of those leaks was very possibly russia . 
  they have the ability , thanks to snowden , follow all phone calls too . 
  this `` leak '' is very probably counter - `` propaganda '' and so be it . 
  we have had so much false information and lies from russia . 
  it is only right to tell the world that what we a possibly countering in the near future . 
  `` our troops on the european border are just joking . 
  you see , they are only joking self-defense happy troops passing by and they took crimea using only irony . '', 
   sweden produces its own military equipment quite a lot , making a jet fighter is quite an achievement , sweden builds some ships and submarines , builds ifvs , has mbts . 
  instead of calling that weak , well , i could agree to just saying it 's not capable of fighting russia . 
  during the cold war and little after that , all the swedish military tech was aimed against ussr military tech . 
  swedish air-force was the 4th largest in the world those days :  during the cold war large amounts of money ( including all that had been reserved for swedish nuclear weapons ) were spent on the swedish air force and domestic airplane production . 
  in 1957 sweden had the world 's fourth most powerful air force , [ 4 ] with about 1000 modern planes in front-line service . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_air_force and it is still a very formidable air-force . 
  also the navy technology is very good . 
  they have developed stealth corvettes and other amazing shit , the anti-ship missiles they produce are best in the world etc. 
  the only thing swedes need to do is push up their ground forces and re-establish a tank brigade or two . 
   i doubt they have any idea what putin is planning . 
  they know pretty much , diplomats are . . were all kgb trained in ussr after all . 
  and these diplomats know that phones are listen and especially their boss ( mr.putin / kgb-fsb ) is listening them ( and others ) . 
  so this `` joking '' about taking `` shitty baltics '' next and then bulgaria , romania ... is not without connections to reality . 
  good . 
  they deserve it . 
  in finland the nato support has slightly gone up , but is still only 22 % . 
  59 % says no . 
  instead finns want to get closer military co-operation with sweden :  finns are ready to align militarily with their western neighbour , sweden . 
  that 's the message from a new poll carried out for yle by taloustutkimus . 
   the survey asked whether people would support a union under which the armed forces of one country would be called on to support the other in a crisis situation . 
  some ** 54 percent said they would support such a union ** , 36 percent opposed it and 10 percent said they did not know .
