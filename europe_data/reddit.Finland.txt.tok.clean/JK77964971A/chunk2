  russia attack nato ? 
  no way . 
  keep calm lithuania , do n't fall into hysteria !, 
   will happen in 2016 that is two years ahead . 
  anything can happen before that . 
  in the first video there is ... 6 x self propelled artillery guns , [ 2s19 msta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2s19_msta ) , caliber 152mm . 
  it is not a tank . 
  the best russian self propelled artillery gun it is though . 
  it 's nbc protected . 
  2 x self propelled anti-aircraft vehicles [ tunguska 9k22 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k22_tunguska ) . 
  it has 2 x 30mm guns and short-medium range aa-missiles and radar . 
  it is in use also in ukraine , belarus etc. 
  and then there is trucks , one mt-lb ( command vehicle ? 
  ) , and some trucks with cranes ( ammo loading ) and 2 sapper/recovery vehicles . 
  there is some text ( 0:48 ) on a crane that looks like russia , can some one confirm ? 
  this is a artillery battery with some aa-cover on a way from somewhere to dunno ' where ... not exactly a big force . 
  also ukraine uses same equipment , but those new trucks indicate these being more likely russian . 
  on the second video there is 13 tanks , possibly [ upgraded t-72 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-72 ) . 
  it 's a tank company ( with supply elements ? ), 
  but nobody nowhere . 
  ca n't say anything about it , those can be also coming from rehearsals or going . 
  need some more prove to that op 's title . 
  although it is sure that russia has military power massed behind the borders and that moving this equipment in bright day light without guards , looks not `` so threatening '' . 
  the real moves are done at night and more guarded etc. 
  russians are just giving some sun bathing to their rusty equipments . 
  the spring is way too early this year . 
   if the shit would be hitting the fan , there would be much more prove , sat picts , stock markets going down etc. 
  russia made those ship-deals because they could n't produce those themselves . 
  it was said that it was a sign about heavy corruption in ship-yards and building infra . 
  but as we see , it could be also a move to keep eu not coherent in it 's russia-politics . 
  well , we do n't say that anymore because there is a quite huge tourist money flow and other big chances to make profit after russia joined wto . 
  and the german-russia gas-pipe goes near our coast , decision made by politicians , that has some effects also . 
  just curious , do you speak other languages than english ? 
  have you lived outside your hometown ever ? 
  been in europe , russia , siberia ? 
  it brainwash those poor young students to believe that there 's never ever been written a world famous play in their language . 
  and when they start to have international connections , the common language is shakespeare . 
  btw , there probably is n't a world famous play in bulgarian language or finnish . 
  and that 's not shakespeare 's fault . 
  that 's the fault of british imperium etc. 
  shakespeare is good , yes . 
  but not that good that even a turengjeti theater group in siberia should play hamlet for yakutian village and 8000 reindeers ... 
  yes but lets not be utter idiots either : brits are in many ways closer to usa than rest of europe . 
  that * nice and freshening war * was the hint of sarcasm ... 
  the way british culture promotes and keeps shakespeare as a semi-god of theater ( and like usa makes hollywood the golden movie heaven ) , it makes small countries theater students to read shakespeare in the original language . 
  that `` brainwashes '' them to british culture and so on . 
  this is why it 's hard to put faces on bank notes . 
  massacre is maybe a too rough word for this ... , 
  oh , sorry , i was meaning their army , they got almost 1000 leopard tanks ( bulgaria has 86 old t-72 's ) and ~ 600 self-propelled artillery tanks ( bulgaria has 96 artillery guns ) . 
  the air force ( greece ) has 280 operational fighters ( italy has under 200 , bulgaria under 20 )  greece spent 2.8 percent of g.d.p. 
  on its military , or about $ 6.9 billion , or around $ 9.3 billion . 
  greece is the largest importer of conventional weapon in europe and its military spending is the highest in the european union ( relative to g.d.p ) [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_greece] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_greece ), 
   the greek government council of foreign affairs and national defense ( kysea ) on wednesday approved the purchase of ** 69 spare parts ** collections for engines for the military 's f-16 block 52 aircraft , at a cost of 183.7 million euros . 
  the order will be placed in the context of a bilateral agreement with the u.s. and it will be covered by funds in an over five years time frame . 
  ... spare parts are not jets . 
  and those birds are expensive to fly . 
  but of course it has some question marks . 
  could they downgrade something ? 
  brits out of eu --  heavy border control and taxes --  riots and shit --  politicians blame eu or britain --  military preparations ( brits go to us ) --  nice and freshening war between usa/britain and eu/russia ? / china ? . 
  not to choose jose m. barroso to a fourth term . 
  that would not be finland ... 
  ... are you complaining about finns complaining ... 
  f \u00b4 kin shakespeare , like there was never `` drama '' or theater elsewhere ... he is a massacre of many native languages in a way that english-speaking man ca n't see ... 
  had to mention that i had to woke up at 0500am to get the 0600am bus that drove in the `` kainuu-korpir\u00e4meperkele '' area up north to go college . 
  i was home usually around 0600pm , did homeworks till i felt asleep . 
   but the thing that matters most has been lost : the joy of learning vanishes early on . 
  finnish children 's enthusiasm for reading is right at the bottom of the table of 45 countries . 
  by the 8th grade , only 6 per cent of pupils feel engaged in the teaching of mathematics . 
  researchers , policy-makers and education professionals all believe that the reason for this stands between the blackboard and the teacher 's table . 
  not to mention that schools are on the darkest period of the year . 
  i remember that i was so tired that the lessons between 8am to 10am where just attempts to sleep with your eyes open . 
  i did n't remember anything of those two hours ... well something , but it was just horrible . 
  $ uro banknotes have bridges on the print 'cause its supposed to tell about `` building bridges between nations '' . 
  like symbolic . 
  but we ca n't have 27 different $ bank notes ... the mess and confusion will be enormous . 
  i 'm against faces and persons on bank notes , especially in $ uro . 
  that would lead to a mess too . 
  someone 's hero is someone 's massacre . 
  what about animals ? 
  trees ? 
  nature ? 
  something that gets our attention to this global climate warming and gives us hope ... or something . 
  so , is this reddit in u.s. ? 
  it 's same in finland . 
  typically the weather phenomena that causes this is high pressure or `` wind patterns '' over atlantic . 
  and this time these dark cloudy weathers are the remnants of the sandy storm from usa east coast . 
  but when it 's grey , it 's not `` freezing cold '' , but when the sun comes out , it means that high pressures from north pole - siberia are pushing the mellow , moisture , `` warm '' air mass from atlantic ( and gulf stream ) back to west and the really cold weathers comes ... 
  this is just quite normal weather , just many degrees warmer than normal , and it will change soon . 
  it comes from swedish kings harsh attempts to wipe out finnish language and people and turn them into swedish . 
  nobody was allowed to speak finnish in front of a swedish authority etc. 
  1916 , it 's not even 100th jubilee ... 
  there is still tzar-gold on london banks from that era ... 
  and the last russian tzar was british king 's cousin ... 
  we have a wonderful example , the europe 's biggest gold mine in `` raahe '' ( owned by swedish ) got problems with it 's waste-water 's ( includes uranium , sulphates , acids , mercury etc. 
  etc. ) . 
  they got a `` permission '' from authorities to dump all that into baltic sea uncleaned . 
  entire italia runs on mafia . 
  can the op put that link through google translator ? 
  my danish is quite rusty ... and i 'm not sure what this publication is ...
