  and you have a point there with the economic affect i do agree with you there . 
  well let me think about what do chinese bring to my mind . 
  chinese tourists in lapland bring shitload of money here . 
  nothing negative to say . 
  then we have africans and middle easterns . 
  hmm . 
  terrorist attacks , 80 % unemployment rate , 16-times more rapes ( public research shows it i can link it if you want ) and no economical benefits . 
  which ones are the threat ? 
  yeah its true they get limited residence permit but state renews them too easily . 
  and if youve lived long enough you can get nationality . 
  thats how it goes here in finland i think . 
  why would they go back ? 
  they dont get free money in their homeland . 
  wake me up when europe has gained more money from them than lost . 
  caliphate of sweden ? 
  europe forever !, 
  dunno if the boat timetables fit directly or does it even consider them . 
  yeah but if we do it , it just destroyes our culture . 
  islam is taking over already . 
  2,1 tfr would just keep our population same . 
  now we are losing almost half each generation . 
  got ta love the beautiful italian villages . 
  i wish you and europe in general could get fertility rates up so future generations could enjoy this ... 
  but fascist parties were banned in 1944 and still it shows democracy . 
  not saying my opinion on neither political movements but sounds stupid as fuck . 
  can someone explain open anocracy ? 
  im not really familiar with the term . 
  i thought we were democratic state at that time . 
  yeah but you asked which top leaders act based on their feelings . 
  your dictator is another one . 
  atat\u00fcrk is turning in his grave ... 
  i really appreciate atat\u00fcrk !, 
  well , id say donald trump is . 
  hes getting the job done there . 
  europe should stop working with this criminal state . 
  they blackmail with refugees . 
  `` give us money or we bring them in . '', 
  proper walls to greece-turkey border . 
  and guard boats along the coastline . 
  everyone coming in must be sent back . 
  its the only way to stop this shit . 
  not strong economy but social benefits which are payd with debt . 
  like was it a guess which country will leave eu first and then theres the flag of the country that did ? 
  tbh the western coast is one of the least forested areas :d, 
  im still trying to get out of the forest and its getting late ... 
  join us come to dark side, 
  when the moon wasnt made of cheese so you have to smuggle it from finland . 
  so if finland has reserve of 900 000 that leaves the rest with reserve of -545 000 ? 
  thank god someone has some balls to deal with this shit . 
  good thing we have another 150 000 coming to europe every 3 months ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upp-qntrlqu then theres this , a black finnish marshal mannerheim . 
  no words for this . 
  neo-nazies in israel is somewhat funny concept tbh . 
  they must exist though . 
  well it has to has something to do with your ( earlier ) goverments asked youtube to block videos like that . 
  only thing we have blocked is iihf hockey matches cause of tv companies ... 
  terrorists need fast movement too so that we arent racist . 
  `` strafgesetzbuch section 86a the german strafgesetzbuch ( criminal code ) in \u00a7 86a outlaws `` use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations '' outside of the contexts of `` art or science , research or teaching '' . 
  symbols affected : the `` heil hitler '' greeting ( 1970 ) [ 8 ] the `` sieg heil '' greeting ( 1990 ) [, 
  `` thai politician gives nazi salute and yells heil hitler in parliament '' its too funny, 
  the enemy of my enemy is my friend like they say . 
  isnt that one of the europol post card wanted . 
  santa claus wanted some finnish guy back . 
  not many lakes in slovenia i guess . 
  suspect could have been under alcohol or drug effects . 
  not terror related . 
  no it doesnt work like that in nordics . 
  in finland he would be free in 10 years cause it was his `` first time '' doing anything like this . 
  jesus i hate our court . 
  of course they will , they are rising in numbers while europeans are going down . 
  `` racists '' and `` nazies '' have said this for years but people only understand when its too late . 
  i wonder if they still count finns going trough estonia to latvia for the cheap ( er ) booze now that estonians raised alcohol taxes . 
  yeah but bosnian muslims are culturally totally different than somalies or iraqies or do you think they also have 1,28 tfr ? 
  still better than muslims, 
  they did sacrifices so that we could live in a good country . 
  we are all gon na die and remember nothing in the void so why not do the least for future generations , get kids . 
  keep this country populated with our culture cause its better , its really better than this muslim route . 
  if you disagree , sorry youre wrong . 
  well i wish laestadians will keep breeding in every generation . 
  all laestadian famielies i know have over 10 kids ... 
  but he did [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/churchill_v_sign_hu_55521.jpg ) instead of [ this ] ( https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_small/public/thumbnails/image/2016/08/15/07/hitler.jpg ), 
  ok thanks i really thought there are one thousand ( 1000 $ ) bills and i just havent seen them because im poor , mr. sherlock ( captain obvious ) holmes . 
  my neighbour once said her husband raised some 1000 euro bills from bank account . 
  lucky you i said ... 
  how will the dictator respond ? 
  `` the evacuation of 12th army from the east to the west banks of the elbe was successfully completed on the night of 7/8 may . 
  general wenck later gave a figure of over 100,000 soldiers and about 300,000 civilian refugees . 
  general von edelsheim reckoned 90,000-100 ,000 troops , of whom 40 percent were unarmed . 
  general moore recorded 40,000 fighting troops , 25,000 unarmed soldiers , 6,000 wounded and 100,000 civilians . '', 
  - slaughter at halbe : the destruction of hitler 's 9th army april 1945 nobody can tell the truth unless you were there counting them ... 
  yeah i love the song . 
  was surprised about the honor to him . 
  heroes of europe : walther wenck and his men who saved hundreds of thousands of encircled civilians and soldiers from halbe pocket to escape west . 
  there are still posts like this on the front page wtf is this . 
  st.pauli , oh yes , i remember . 
  there were anti fascist stuff being sold all over the place and every logo had fist crushing swastika . 
  its been a while, 
  so what if he doesnt speak english . 
  like if he would , it would just be shouting nonsense , waving hands and trying to insult others and their `` nazi '' countries . 
  whos the disrespectful now ?
