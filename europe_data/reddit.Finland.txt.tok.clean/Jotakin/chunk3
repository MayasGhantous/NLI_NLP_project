  estonians visit finland for jobs and higher wages , mostly . 
  i think the map is counting those workers as tourists for some reason . 
  it could 've been much worse , the soviets had enough bombs to level half of the city . 
  most of the bombs fell into forests and fields around helsinki , thanks to both incredible performance by our anti-air units and low morale of soviet pilots . 
  well it has to use radio waves or something similar , so nothing stops you from building a transmitter yourself . 
  you 'll have to figure out the correct frequency and/or message to that individual car to stop it , which is more challenging . 
  what is more worrying is when someone finds out the correct algorithm for that . 
  at that point they can f.ex . 
  cause crashes with one button and its almost impossible for police to figure out who did it . 
  the only way to stop that is to replace/update that device in all cars which wont be easy . 
  not to mention that criminals will figure out how to disable the system . 
  it 'll still be useful for stopping drunk drivers but it wont work against bank robbers or other serious criminals . 
  entepraneurs can work as much as they want and can take as much money from their business as they want , its part of their freedom . 
  agreements between unions are legally binding even for those companies or workers who arent in unions themselves . 
  so as the article says we have de facto minimum wages , they just vary from profession to another . 
  someone is going to lose his head because of that one mistake . 
  from what i 've heard its impossible to discuss or criticice immigration in sweden , since everyone who doesnt want to accept all immigrants will quickly get flagged as racist and after that nobody will take you seriously . 
  its basically like how getting flagged as nazi will destroy you political career in germany . 
  also sweden has gathered plenty of quilt over the years , from colonies at 1600 's to not helping nearby countries in ww2 . 
  the name comes from nuuttipukki , who visited houses at nuutinp\u00e4iv\u00e4 , [ st. knut 's day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._knut%27s_day ) . 
  nuuttipukki wandered from house to house dressed as a goat , demanding food and beer from the residents . 
  santa claus has replaced him and we no longer celebrate nuutinp\u00e4iv\u00e4 but we still use pukki in his name . 
  joulupukki is nowdays just a name for santa claus and nobody in finland realizes that it actually refers to a christmas goat . 
  e : the movie rare exports is related to this version of santa claus , i think . 
  havent seen it myself . 
  it goes far beyond that , though . 
  estonians and finns were part of the same finnic group that ended up here in northern europe . 
  we even spoke the same language at one point , and even though both of them evolved into different directions we can still understand simple words like sin\u00e4 and viisitoista from the other languange . 
  what is more worrying is that this seems to be an trend rather than small variance from test to test . 
  we 'll have to do something to stop sliding further down . 
  we fell down on the ranking and are tied with swedes now . 
  a sad day for finland . 
  `` palataan asiaan '' means `` lets return to the subject '' . 
  most commonly used as a `` lets talk about this later '' when ending a conversation . 
  kuusi = spruce kuusi = the number six kuusi = six of something kuu = moon + si = yours palaa = to burn palaa = third person form of palata = to return palaa = one of the forms for pala = a piece of something, 
  shit happens , i guess . 
  not the first time someone has crashed with hawk , inexperienced pilots tend to make mistakes . 
  good to know that ~ ~ they both ~ ~ at least one of them surrived the crash . 
  ^ ^ e : ^ ^ that 'll ^ ^ teach ^ ^ me ^ ^ to ^ ^ wait ^ ^ before ^ ^ opening ^ ^ my ^ ^ cake ^ ^ socket , ^ ^ i ^ ^ guess . 
  from what i 've heard this is pretty common in conversations with finns and people from other nordic contries : everyone else can speak in swedish fine except for the finns who have trouble keeping up with normal conversation speed , especially if there are norwegian or danish accents involved . 
  thus everyone has to switch to english . 
  this can even cause arguments between finns - strong supporters of mandatory swedish demand that swedish should be used since it is a nordic languange while others want to switch to english to ensure that everyone can understand and keep up with the conversation . 
  true . 
  jokerit trade hit the front page because of their move to khl , only one opposing that rosatom power plant is the green party and arctech sale should means they 'll keep selling ships to russian corporations for a long time . 
  even the recent russian land purchases for their dachas have caused more controversy . 
  sorry , didnt realize it was such a touchy topic, 
  the map is basically split into three groups : wealthy north and west europe , southern european countries which got hit by eurozone crisis and former communist countries behind the iron curtain . 
  i 'm a bit suprised how clearly it is visible on the map . 
  reminds me of [ this news article ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/torkea_perhevakivalta_kohdistuu_miehiin_naisia_useammin/1352897 ) from few years ago : in finland women do as many aggravated assaults and homicide attempts towards their spouces as men do . 
  i dont know about every anti-eu party , but at least the finns party here doesnt oppose the idea behind eu . 
  they 'd just like it to be a council for european countries instead of an european federation which it is currently shaping into . 
  european parlament is the secound best place for accomplishing that right after each contries own parlament . 
  there 's not much else up there except farmers , majority of finns live in grey or light green areas of the map . 
  hard to say , i only understood one word out of that . 
  the next test that will get published in a few months , not the next year 's test, 
  was a slow week in finland , only two newsworthy events this week : * one guy from our parlament invited his friend to the parlament house . 
  his friend did a nazi salute inside , and the mp took a picture of that . 
  [ mp got removed from his party ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finns_party_confirms_expulsion_of_controversial_mp/6866589 ) , and his friend got a lifetime ban to parlament house . 
  * one of the greenpeace `` pirates '' is a finn , and she might spend the next decade in a russian prison . 
  in other news : * finland might lose its # 1 spot at pisa . 
  other european countries are catching up and last year 's test ( which will be published this december ) focused on math which is n't our strongest subject . 
  * [ one metal band did a song about our minister of interior affairs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kften3u52y ) . 
  she is from our only religious party and the lyrics are about things she 'd like to illegalize . 
  * authorities have checked the citizens iniative for a better copyright law . 
  there were about a thousand invalid/duplicate names , but after those got removed it still has enough to get into parlament . 
  * [ finland is no longer the worst rugby contry in the world . 
  ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/urheilu/art-1288605816573.html ) our national team beat greece and we passed them in the international ranking . 
  it somehow decided to combine `` woman with a different name '' and `` 25th september '' into that . 
  they arent defending christianity directly but they 're defending the european society and culture which is based on christian values . 
  microsoft bought nokias phone division , not the whole company . 
  but i agree , they probably told the others to agree so that ms could hide behind a group and not get as much negative press over the thing . 
  they tried that couple of years ago when estonia got into eu and almost all restrictions on importing were removed . 
  after that alcohol consumption increased quickly , alcohol-related healthcare and security costs increased and bar profits & alcohol tax revenues decreased . 
  i think their current plan is to add some border control back to make it harder to smuggle and sell estonian alcohol in finland . 
  finland has exports-dependant economy , so having a control over currency would help our exports industry . 
  easy way to notice this is to compare finland with sweden ; the two countries are next to eachother and are socially or economically similar . 
  for some reason sweden hasnt gotten hit by the european recession as hard as finland , and euro membership is the most common explanation to this, 
  if this would 've been asked 5 years ago , the answers would be compleatly diffrent . 
  nokia doesnt have as big chunk of the economy as it used to , and the current recession is caused by euro membership and not the fall of nokia . 
  besides , nokia wont compleatly disappear from finland . 
  microsoft will keep the current employees for now and even if they move out nokia will still have its nsn-branch which they recently bought . 
  they started appearing few years ago , nowdays some of them are crazy enough to stay here during the winter . 
  finns dont usually direct taxes to anything specific . 
  goverment uses the money to fill whatever expenses the budget has . 
  you need to learn the languange anyways if you want a job . 
  true finns are one of the biggest parties in finland . 
  the other big parties are afraid that if they are too pro-eu then they 'll lose voters and push true finns to biggest party , so they are more eurosceptic than few years ago . 
   any insight into ( on ? ), 
  the views of parliament on the topic ? 
  everyone is at summer vacation at the moment  what happens if the mps reject the petition ? 
  nothing . 
  current law stays as it is , no changes will be done . 
  not our fault that english has so limited selection of swear words . 
  in sweden that would count as discrimination too ; you 'd force women to dress as men do . 
  the police clearly cant scare rioters away and i 'd rather see these volunteers taking control instead of army patrolling the streets . 
  but on the other hand there is the risk that one side provokes the other and the whole thing turns into a bloodbath . 
  [ english version from yle news ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/police_chief_putin_on_suspects_list_by_mistake/6573803 ), 
  it temperature is above 0c then people go crazy for such a nice spring day . 
  [ sadly it isnt that warm now ] ( http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/weather/helsinki ), 
  worker starts one man company , you make a deal with that company 2 .
