conscription is an archaic practice with no place in a modern society for some countries it is the only realistic way to have a proper army . 
  why would scotland be poorer if it was independent ? 
  so , it would n't be racist , if obama was n't black or , if he was compared to a different animal in the picture ? 
  solar power is a finite resource too . 
   the media has to try and genuinely illuminate issues , rather than use statistics to sensationalise . 
  50 000 people ? 
  there are couple cities with more than 50 000 people in that area , like oulu , kuopio , joensuu and rovaniemi . 
  there are actually about a million people in that area . 
  in finland it 's illegal not to wear a helmet while cycling . 
  like [ this ] ( http://translate.google.fi/#sv/en/billig ) . 
  was it shown in tv too ? 
  wow , is this seriously from this year 's olympics ? 
  how do you ski in the center of stockholm ? 
  actually not all signs are bilingual in finland . 
  only in southern and western finland . 
   these `` idiots '' fled a war that was caused in part by `` us '' . 
  finland has nothing to do with the war in syria . 
  but is n't it always raining in britain ? 
  she died or learned the truth . 
  finland accepted 400 000 refugees after the war . 
  also `` one who flees '' in finnish and probably estonian . 
  what 's refugee in syrian ? 
  even in finland people sometimes say things like `` i 'm going to go to europe '' or something similar when they are talking about the rest of europe . 
  are private schools free in denmark ? 
  luxembourg is actually more populous than iceland . 
  why finnish ? 
   finland is pretty scandinavian culturally , except for the eastern parts is there really a big cultural difference between east and west ? 
  what are the differences ? 
   i have read that estonian is complicated but estonian is the easiest language to learn, 
  that can be done in many languages , but i think that hungarian word has only one noun . 
  baltic countries are in alphabetical order from north to south . 
  hungarian is not related to turkish, 
  it is still used in [ the finnish airforce ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/suomen_ilmavoimien_esikunta.svg ) , just not on the planes . 
  the army also uses some [ swastikas ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/utjr_flag.gif ) . 
   since vaasa was the place his first plane landed in or something no , it was because the finnish government was in vaasa during the civil war . 
  mikkeli also has a swastika on its [ coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/mikkeli.vaakuna.svg ) . 
  there is also a swastika on [ a finnish flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/presidential_standard_of_finland.svg ) . 
  do you mean a cheeseburger meal for 5 $ ? 
  a cheeseburger in finland is 1 $ . 
  you have that one [ finnish 2011/2013 \\ ( ? \\ ) 10 $ ] ( http://www.mania33.com/webshop/cat/graphics/products/fe2_6b3fee09.jpg ) coin there twice . 
  party | seats/1 000 000 votes -- | -- conservative | 29 labour | 25 scottish national party | 39 liberal democrat | 3 democratic unionist party | 43 sinn fein | 23 plaid cymru | 17 social democratic & labour party | 30 ulster unionist party | 17 ukip | 0,3 green party | 0,9 this really shows how bad first-past-the-post voting system is . 
  sweden and denmark too ? 
  still less relevant than armenia . 
  billionaires per capita would be more helpful . 
  i think between the world wars finland was considered a baltic state too and nowadays finland is not a baltic state only because finland was n't annexed by the soviet union . 
  the distinction between finland being nordic and not baltic while estonia is the opposite seems very arbitrary to me . 
  in my opinion estonia ( and other baltics ) could be considered nordic if estonians consider themselves nordic , because they are culturally so close to nordics . 
  how do you know it is black panther party hand sign ? 
  [ it could also be future of music coalition hand sign . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raised_fist#groups_that_have_used_the_symbol ), 
   your language belongs to the baltic finns branch of finno-ugric group . 
  so does finnish though . 
  communism is not about strong state . 
  the goal in communism is to get rid of the state . 
   why is bulgaria cat green ? 
  why is serbia war ? 
  what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  no it is not . 
  social democracy is a form of capitalism because it has private ownership of the means of production . 
  yes , all businesses are owned by capitalists in a capitalist society . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  i meant that for some people it is not `` should i choose employer a or b '' , but it is `` should i choose employer a or no job at all '' or they might not even be able to get any job . 
   why should the workers always be collective owners ? 
  because then the workers can get the fruit of their labour themselves and they do n't need to give it to someone else . 
  that 's the whole point of socialism . 
  the system demands that you give the fruits of your labour to someone else . 
  not everyone can choose their employer let alone start a successful company . 
  sure , but that 's not the reality we live in . 
  if the workers owned the means of production , they would also own the capital . 
  all wealth is created by the workers . 
  not all socialists advocate for centralized state and the goal of socialism is to get rid of the state entirely . 
  by dictatorship of the proletariat marx did n't mean dictatorship in the traditional sense . 
  by dictatorship of the proletariat marx meant a state which was ruled by the working class . 
  with that terminology the society in which we live in is dictatorship of the bourgeoisie . 
  i know that , but marx did not advocate totalitarianism , quite the opposite actually . 
  why should anyone other than the workers get the fruits of their labour ? 
  not because of marxist doctrine , but because of totalitarian doctrine . 
  social democracy is not socialism though . 
  it was like 20 \u00b0 c here today . 
   norway : not cold ... wtf actually norway is surprisingly warm even compared to finland or sweden . 
  for example the lowest recorded temperature in [ troms\u00f8 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/troms%c3%b8 ) is -18 \u00b0 c , which was about the same as the ** average ** temperature in [ northern finnish lapland last january ] ( http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/tammikuu ) . 
  or people who want to join nato are just more vocal . 
   but is a more democratic system automatically better ? 
  what do we actually gain ? 
  it 's also more democratic to have a free vote for every issue ever decided by government but many would argue that such a system would be incredibly worse . 
  in democracy people could get a ruler that they actually want . 
  people might like the current monarch now , but you can never really know what kind of ruler you get in monarchy . 
   as for the problem of poverty , the same could be said about all the rich people in the country who live luxurious lives at the expense of the state ( huge tax breaks and loopholes ) and at the expense of those poor people who work for them at rock bottom wages . 
  that 's a much greater injustice , in my opinion . 
  i agree completely on that . 
  but just because bigger problems exist does n't mean the smaller ones should n't be fixed . 
  for example the monarchs could get the same wage as normal politicians and nothing more . 
  i know that countries like canada have democracy in respect of the parliament , but in countries with monarchy people ca n't elect their head of state ( not democratic in respect of the head of state ) while in countries like finland people elect the head of state ( democratic ) . 
   to me , the better question is , what would we actually practically gain or improve in our politically system by getting rid of the queen ? 
  like i said , you would have a more democratic system without monarchy . 
  also , i do n't understand how it is fair at all how one family can live a luxurious life at the expense of the state while at the same time there are many people in poverty . 
  how is monarchy better than democracy ? 
  not anymore, 
  it is not about the queens actual power nowadays . 
  it is about what monarchy symbolises .
