  i think most of them actually speak finnish . 
  i think they at least learn finnish at school except if they are from ahvenanmaa . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhbxonfmz4 ), 
  it 's probably not the same people arguing on both sides though . 
  it could just mean that people are divided on the issue . 
   in eastern europe it was seen as some sort of magical modern western thing , like a piece of american dream in your life . 
  [ in finland it still is ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wjkuktc.jpg ), 
  maybe you should x-post this to / r/sweden .

  but ananas is the most important filling in a pizza !, 
  at least in finland most pizzerias seem to be turkish for some reason . 
  we already call you britannia, 
  because in the word czech the ch is pronounced as k. 
  i 'm not sure but i think learning ipa might take more time for the speakers of some languages than others . 
  [ for example finnish and estonian alphabet use almost the same letters as ipa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_estonian_and_finnish ) ( only v and estonian \u00f5 and \u00fc are slightly different ) . 
  according to wikipedia \u0160 actually comes to finnish from the czech language . 
  how did countries like rwanda or namibia end up so high on that list ? 
  both above the uk for example . 
  so does this mean that there were 3224 jewish scientists per 100 000 jews or per 100 000 people ? 
  and a friend who runs a bank . 
  why does somaliland have that colour ? 
  germany can not into baltic sea . 
  and more importantly more karma . 
  why are they speaking english and singing in russian ? 
  marseillaise actually used to be the russian anthem for short time between the revolutions . 
  that putin banner is just an april fools joke , right ? 
  i think it actually originates from [ spurdo sp\u00e4rde ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spurdo-sparde ) . 
  it 's probably just a coincidence . 
  also , the finnish word does n't have the same meaning as the estonian . 
   munadep\u00fchad - munapyh\u00e4 - egg holiday is the only one which does n't completely change its meaning . 
  except muna is slang for dick/balls . 
  the british anthem is quite boring and the lyrics are really bad . 
  [ and polish `` tak '' means `` no '' in indonesian ] ( https://i.imgur.com/cetd8a2.png ), 
  what do the comments say ? 
  [ more finnish swears ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uknipmocomq ), 
   i shudder to think of what would happen if the americans stopped helping prop up the house of saud or pakistan or morocco . 
  what would happen ? 
  is that a joke or do they actually speak good french ? 
  is that some dutch meme or what ? 
  as a savonian i think estonian sounds more like the southern finnish dialects . 
  i 'm sure there is at least [ one person ] ( http://kepu.fi/ ) who thinks it 's a good idea . 
  what do you mean by rolling letters ? 
  the one supported by nato would win, 
  [ video for those who have n't seen it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ), 
  no point using the swedish name for the cities , since their populations are more than 90 % finnish speaking . 
  to be clear , he meant telemarketer , not phone salesman . 
  such is life ? 
  what reason ? 
  [ he is american ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2oy7hp/_/cmrnxa5 ), 
  [ are latvians jews ? 
  if estonia leaves we could call it `` exit '' . 
  most eu countries ' population is actually growing . 
   i think it is a bias in the data : if you are old , your body starts failing and the mere passing of time means more things are wrong , therefore you are less happy in the first place , regardless of how the economy is doing . 
  the reverse argument is true for young people who gain more freedom and economic opportunities with age . 
  but that should n't have an impact because this is compared to the level of happiness in 2013 .

  [ finland number one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_forest_area#countries ) ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ europe, 
  i calculated the relative change from 2015 to 2080 for each country . 
  let me know if there 's an error . 
  country | change -- | -- belgium | 47 % bulgaria | -32 % czech republic | 4 % denmark | 20 % germany | -19 % estonia | -22 % ireland | 28 % greece | -30 % spain | 3 % france | 19 % croatia | -18 % italy | 7 % cyprus | 44 % latvia | -32 % lithuania | -37 % luxembourg | 129 % hungary | -12 % malta | 13 % netherlands | -1 % austria | 12 % poland | -23 % portugal | -31 % romania | -18 % slovenia | -3 % slovakia | -29 % finland | 16 % sweden | 45 % united kingdom | 32 % iceland | 42 % norway | 71 % switzerland | 44 %, 
  two years ago i was the one throwing candies in exactly that kind of situation . 
  maybe it was you . 
  it is german for pyongyang . 
  where 's iceland ? 
  estonia of course, 
  i mean that according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_ukraine ) , 17 % of ukrainians identify as ethnic russians . 
  yeah of course , but it is probably a lot more common . 
  what i tried to say is that at first i thought the 10 % seemed a bit low , but i googled the russian minority in ukraine and apparently it is a bit smaller than i thought so the 10 % seems reasonable to me now . 
  apparently `` only '' about 17 % of ukrainians are russian speaking ( i thought it would have been higher ) , so i guess you 're right . 
  does n't the russian minority in ukraine support putin ? 
  that 's [ zeeland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeeland ) . 
  and then there is [ sealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_sealand ) . 
  you should post a sung version in the future . 
  can someone translate what they said ? 
   spelling is n't difficult . 
  the fact that it is possible to have spelling competitions tells a lot about how hard english spelling is even for natives . 
   second , and more importantly , different regions have different pronunciations !, 
  not a problem if you make the language phonemic and everyone just writes like they speak . 
  is a single digit in base 1 million okay ? 
  that 's not serious , right ? 
  what is that ? 
  i see many people writing esti instead of eesti . 
  is that some kind of joke that i do n't get or do people just write it wrong ? 
  does that actually happen every year or did they do it just for the video ? 
  and the 2nd biggest artillery force in europe . 
  only russia has a bigger one . 
  it 's actually sssr . 
  cccp is just sssr in russian cyrillic alphabet .

   and i think it 's the only one that has a definite article ( `` the '' ) in it 's english name . 
  strange !, 
  the united states , the philippines ... countries that are in plural have a definite article in their name in english . 
   \u00c4ia\u00f6\u00f6\u00f5ud is that a real word ? 
  what does it mean ? 
  how does that work with things like tv news ?
