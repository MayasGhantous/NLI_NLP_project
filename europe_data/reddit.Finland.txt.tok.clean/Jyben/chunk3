  do the different regions need separate tv news because they could n't understand them otherwise ? 
  i agree, 
  [ the rasmus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ao2u7f_qzg ) is a finnish band, 
  no , it comes from the latin word [ germania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germania#modern_use ) . 
  there 's also european russia . 
  of course it is the arrogant french and lazy italian speakers ' fault . 
  i think that is just how languages change over time . 
  but that does n't explain switzerland . 
  you should separate the rank and the other number because it is quite confusing like that . 
  for example you could have it like this : 1 . 
  sweden 70.94 2 . 
  the netherlands 70.58 etc. . . 
  oh okay , i misunderstood what you meant . 
  but then hakkapeliitta does n't make sense . 
  that 's a totally finnish name . 
   they should just have named themselves `` soldiers of carolus '' [ after a swedish king ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_xii_of_sweden ), 
  who is ruotsalainen ? 
  [ compared to other europeans finns do n't smoke a lot . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita ), 
  but the water feels colder because it conducts heat faster . 
  why ? 
  [ it is almost -20 \u00b0 c in helsinki ] ( http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/saa/helsinki ) , which is still cold at least in my opinion . 
  the vietnam war and a hypothetical war between russia and finland/sweden are not comparable at all . 
  in one conscripts are invading a country on the other side of the world and in the other people are fighting for the existence of their homeland . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i just had those two because i could n't think of anything better and it was easy to get good pictures for them . 
  does swedish count as a foreign language in finland ? 
  actually it is 86 % of approval and 14 % of disapproval . 
  what 's 11 stedentocht ? 
  the post is about immigrants though . 
   on a serious note - this is the type of refugees we should accept in latvia . 
  are n't those ukrainians immigrants , not refugees ? 
  and the next one was obama . 
  [ sika ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-cupdyb9um ), 
  it 's an endless cycle . 
  russia provokes nato because nato provoked russia -  nato provokes russia because russia provoked nato -  russia provokes nato because nato provoked russia -  nato provokes russia because russia provoked nato -  ... 
  it 's even on a variant of the [ finnish flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/presidential_standard_of_finland.svg ) . 
  to better relations with russia ? 
  maybe it is just rounded up normally ? 
  [ ievan polkka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) [ finnish folk music by a metal band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezkcyykkwua ), 
  [ same with finlandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwvavccnts ), 
  [ buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo ) is a grammatically correct sentence . 
  english confirmed as inherently difficult language !, 
  [ jouhikko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2q17a01sza ), 
  what are you talking about ? 
  estonian is clearly the easiest language to learn . 
  finland has never been fascist . 
   i mean we had a tv show where a comedian puts up pictures of children burn victims and other comedians make fun of that person . 
  link ? 
  the colours on the map and legend are different . 
  if nordic countries are counted together they become the biggest group . 
  there are 2645 ( +263 ) people from nordic countries . 
  yeah but it should be mentioned . 
  in this case it could mean 0 too . 
  the colour for lithuania and some other countries is not in the legend . 
  nokia has made a lot of stuff in the past . 
  for example [ boots ] ( http://www.kumisaapaskauppa.fi/images/kuvat/nokiannaalisaapas.jpg ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3rzvx3/english_language_proficiency_index_2015_1365x1051/cwst5pb ) might explain it , if that is the same map . 
   condensed steam that 's called water . 
  why has germany taken almost 100 000 serbian refugees ? 
  as a decimal separator , yes . 
  well , at least in finnish thousands are not separated by a dot . 
  at least you 're not ukraine . 
  and to be clear point is used here to separate thousands . 
  the same applies to the western world too not just russia . 
  not all of them border each other . 
  for example portugal and italy do n't border each other . 
  learn finnish , because it is different . 
  you can even drive a car on the ice , if it is thick enough . 
  there are some roads on ice in winter . 
  it is dangerous . 
  but it is less dangerous if you 're skiing . 
  what was the goal of this revolution ? 
  democracy , capitalism or something else ? 
  mannerheim was an officer in the russian army before the october revolution . 
  he fought for russia in the first world war and russo-japanese war . 
   globalization has changed the way the world works . 
  that 's what they said in 1914 too . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpyohp1gtrq ) is black metal and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4bgxh3sj2q ) is heavy metal . 
   a black person will never be european of any kind the first people who came to europe were black . 
  were those people not european ? 
  every single human has black ancestors . 
  [ why are europeans \\ ( except belarus \\ ) not unionised ? 
  ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=13&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;button= ), 
  and the j is pronounced like y in `` yes '' . 
  nobody ever says bad things about finland :(, 
  [ should n't it be 5 then ? 
  finland has won ice hockey championship only twice . 
   nightwish is pretty far down on the list . 
  it 's third . 
  how can you not know how to pronounce your mother tongue ? 
  maybe it 's the rolling r in the middle that makes them sound so good . 
  [ us soldiers training in finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l67mnbplfmy ), 
  what does this have to do with europe ? 
  actually most muslims are from south/south eastern asia . 
  from countries like indonesia , pakistan or bangladesh . 
  only about 20 % of muslims are from the middle east/north africa . 
  actually most muslims are from south/south eastern asia .
