  so when saudi arabia says `` women ca n't have their head uncovered '' , are they just `` removing one option '' and not dictating their choice ? 
  it is the same in finnish .

  why ?

  anti-american is not the same as pro-russian . 
  you can be anti-american and anti-russian at the same time . 
  nowadays it 's the right that is apologist of putin and russia , not the left . 
  the official record low was in 1985,

  the r 's are pronounced a bit funnily but other than that it sounds correct . 
  nobody with power really cares about anything else than money and it is economically better to stay friendly with the current government .

  the record low in chicago is -36 \u00b0 c.

   i know what the ideal version of communism is supposed to be ( ie . 
  no state ) , just like ideally capitalism is the free market with startups having an equal shot at the pie as larger companies . 
  the difference there is that statelessness is not just an ideal for communism , it is part of the definition for it , unlike free market for capitalism . 
   moreover , i 'd take your no true scotsman more seriously if `` real communists '' did n't defend the ussr are much as they do . 
  you ca n't both say that the soviet union does n't represent communism , but also , it gets an unfair rap and it was n't really that bad , man . 
  it 's not `` no true scotsman '' , since communism is well defined and the ussr did n't meet the definition . 
  i 'm totally fine with calling the ussr socialist but not communist . 
  there is no government in communism because there is no state . 
  countries like ussr were not communist and they never even claimed to be . 
  are you implying that communism and democracy are mutually exclusive , because they are n't ? 
  in fact communism is inherently democratic . 
  it depends on who you ask . 
  talk about democracy ... 
  bigger countries can enforce international law on smaller nations for sure .

  the number of shells fired is mind blowing . 
  for example in the first day of somme , the british fired about 1,5 million shells in one day . 
  that 's about 17 shells every ** second ** for the whole day .

  that swiss german sounds more like dutch than german . 
  there does n't need to be that many rich people even . 
  for example even 1 billionaire would raise the average wealth in alabama by about 200 $ ( i do n't know how that would translate to gdp ) . 
  higher gdp does n't necessarily mean that people make more money . 
  was n't that pretty much their main goal with any socialist country .

  i do n't know what kind of welfare system serbia has , but at least in finland if you really just want to watch netflix all day , you can do that with the existing welfare already . 
  but not many people do that . 
  most people want more than just watch netflix all day . 
  soviet union was [ state capitalist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_capitalism ) , not socialist , because they still had many key things to capitalism ( wage labour , exploitation , alienation of labour , etc. ) . 
   `` socialism aims for abolition of private property '' on means of production , so that they are owned and controlled by the state . 
  not necessarily true . 
  many forms of socialism want to immediately abolish the state and those that do n't usually want to use the state to hand over the mop to the workers and then the state is supposed to `` wither away '' because it becomes redundant . 
  czech is easy to tell apart because of all the weird letters . 
  i think they just translated that to finnish with google translator . 
  do you even know what socialism is ? 
  socialism aims for abolition of private property , while fascism does n't . 
  national socialism is fascism , not socialism . 
  just because they call themselves socialists does n't make them socialists . 
  and it does n't even matter if you say that to a nazi or a socialist . 
  you will be lynched either way . 
  there are tons of different kinds of socialism . 
  for example an anarchist might feel that marxism-leninism is not `` real socialism '' , not because they do n't consider it socialism , but because they do n't agree on some small details . 
  nordics never were socialist . 
  most of the mop have always been privately owned .

  you talk like punishing the workers is the only possible option . 
  maybe the workers would be more willing to make reforms if they were not the only ones being punished . 
  why should there be reforms if the french people do n't want them ? 
  then there is [ finlandization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) , which has a completely different meaning . 
  that is not the definition for socialism though . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ) : `` socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production , as well as the political ideologies , theories , and movements that aim at their establishment . '', 
  but what about the socialist part ? 
   a socialist bank-friendly populist party can you explain what that even means ?
