  estonia and i guess for some people sweden . 
   also i 've seen the opinion polls in which poland is considered second most dangerous country to lithuania it might not mean that people think poland is actually a threat . 
  it could just mean that lithuania does n't really have any threats besides russia . 
  technically the korean war is still going on too . 
  how do they slice cheese without cheese slicer ? 
  how can someone not like pineapple on pizza ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  is n't it completely normal to put ketchup on pasta ? 
  iceland and luxembourg too . 
  yes, 
  are you sure the implication was not that estonia can into nordic ? 
  there are two types of winter tires . 
  [ studded winter tires ] ( https://dc602r66yb2n9.cloudfront.net/pub/web/images/product_images/nt_product-image_hkpl_8.png?c=product_image_desktop ) definitely have visible differences . 
  hmm ... 
  i guess you 're right . 
  i just read the finnish page which says that it is a numeral . 
  i guess it is a numeral in finnish but not in english then . 
  how about [ sami languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_sami ) ? 
  are they norwegian ? 
  no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/numeral_ ( linguistics ), 
  just albania, 
  with that logic estonian used to be a russian language . 
  czech language looks like a mess anyway . 
  actually second is a numeral . 
  that 's actually what [ russification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) means . 
  use / r / , not / u / . 
  literally `` kalsarik\u00e4nnit '' just means `` underwear drunk '' . 
  there are some exceptions in finnish but they are usually quite small . 
  for example there is at least [ one sound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velar_nasal ) in finnish that does n't have a letter for it and it is usually written as n or g. 
  [ click the speaker icon ] ( https://translate.google.fi/#fi/en/kalsarik%c3%a4nnit ), 
   would they have won otherwise from just people voting ? 
  yes, 
  oh yeah , you are right . 
  and to be clear i do n't speak bulgarian or any other language that uses cyrillic alphabet , i 've just learned the alphabet . 
  that is a bit more correct i think . 
  or cccp, 
  hungarian has articles ? 
  til, 
  finnish saunas are dry saunas, 
  if you think you can sit in a finnish sauna indefinitely you obviously have not been in a real finnish sauna . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think it might be the proximity to sea . 
  in summer the sea is colder than air so it cools it down , but oymyakon is further from the sea so it is n't affected by it so much . 
  you can see it at 1:33:15 on [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/nrr3ppoqbzw?t=1h33m15s ) . 
  but it is still comparing gdp to gnp , which are different things . 
  or greece . 
  greece is below czechia , estonia and slovenia . 
  but the summers are surprisingly warm though . 
  according to wikipedia average temperature in summer in oymyakon is about the same as in finland . 
  how cold/warm is it in vladivostok around the year compared to st. petersburg ? 
  [ oh wow , that city looks cool .

  you stole it from genoa . 
  that does n't explain latvia though . 
  how could potatoes freeze when there are no potatoes ? 
  how can you be so sure that china wo n't overtake europe ? 
   slovenia under developed  higher hdi than portugal  higher gdp per capita than portugal, 
  oh , i thought you meant from 0 to 1 . 
  it would n't be 100 % increase it would be \u221e % increase . 
  the thought of 20 million people in an area 2/3 the size of my country is frightening to me . 
  [ this is what they do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zcgd8a5jc ), 
  but compound words are cheating . 
  i bet german does n't have any word this long , if you do n't count compound words : ep\u00e4j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llistytt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6myydell\u00e4\u00e4ns\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00f6h\u00e4n . 
  in finnish it is like that . 
  `` he/she is going there '' would be `` h\u00e4n on menossa sinne '' . 
   bad self esteem finnish people finland in a nutshell . 
  how long does it take to walk 600 km ? 
  none of them should die in a car crash either . 
  i doubt it would rank above russia . 
  [ he also invented disco coffee maker . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighwz5jt6xa ), 
  no , it ca n't be that . 
  hdi increased more in russia than anywhere else on the list , but it still dropped one rank . 
  that 's just mathematically impossible unless a new country was added to the list above russia . 
  maybe a new country was measured this year ? 
  ukraine lost crimea . 
  [ not sure if this counts for albania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_kingdom_\\ ( 1943 % e2 % 80 % 9344 \\ ) ) . 
  yeah , i think like -10 c is the perfect winter temperature . 
  dutch and danish are truly the most horrible sounding languages . 
  really , i do n't know anything about dutch politics . 
  i just thought that maybe the right-wing parties would be more willing to work with other right wing parties . 
  what will be the most likely coalition ? 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i was just comparing it to finland which uses d'hondt , but has a higher threshold . 
  but it is actually just because finland uses voting districts and the netherlands does n't . 
  not only in the us . 
  honestly i do n't see what 's the problem with ketchup and spaghetti . 
  if i 've understood it correctly , it works like this ( dutch people can correct me if i 'm wrong ) : first each party gets ( p \\* 150 ) / a seats ( rounded down ) , where p is number of votes the party gets and a is the total number of votes . 
  and only after that the remaining seats are distributed with d'hondt method . 
  probably even in the world . 
  and the dutch system is not even purely d'hondt . 
  the dutch system favours small parties more than purely d'hondt . 
  the netherlands currently ( before these elections ) have 11 parties and 8 independents in the parliament , so quite a many of them actually have a chance . 
  but only two had any real chance of winning . 
  is that eleven thousand euros or eleven euros ? 
  imagine if the non-voters ' party got more than 50 % of the seats and formed a government . 
  no , it does n't . 
  apparently the etymology for those is the same , but the finnish words for apple and china ( omena , kiina ) are not even close to that . 
  which languages have the same word for the fruit and colour ? 
  in finnish the fruit is appelsiini and colour is oranssi . 
  is it actually like that in other languages besides english ?
