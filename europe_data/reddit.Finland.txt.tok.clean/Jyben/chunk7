  and not just in europe . 
  in the whole world , except the us . 
  in 2011-2014 finland would have had all the colours . 
  it was a coalition of 6 parties . 
  there is not nearly as high concentration of furries in northern italy or eastern spain as that map would suggest . 
  i do n't think germany is that much more populated than the rest of europe . 
  talossa can also mean `` in a house '' , because finnish does n't have a way to distinguish them . 
  most likely they are not involved in crime because that 's what they like doing , but because they do n't have any other option . 
  73kg of cheese in the car , 73kg of cheese , take one down , pass it around, 
  the mean wealth is 5th highest in america , but median wealth is only 27th highest , just below slovenia . 
  the wealth inequality is huge in america . 
  [ belarus ] ( https://youtu.be/uhvgjxe9zoq ), 
  but you still call finland by the swedish name . 
  what is that ? 
  / r/fingols, 
  no , obviously everyone should use hein\u00e4kuu . 
   i 'm also 100 % it 's heinikuu in karelian because y is n't used like that in finnic due to vocal harmony . 
  no , it is correct . 
  not all finnic languages have vowel harmony . 
  for example estonian does n't have vowel harmony . 
  do we ? 
  that 's not even hard . 
  that is just multiple words put together to form a long word . 
  that is just a single word with a couple suffixes . 
  some parts of the netherlands are actually below the sea level i think . 
  44 degree sauna ? 
  that 's freezing . 
  they might have been abroad . 
  they are further west . 
  i guess english is really the odd one here . 
  i might be wrong , but i think there are no limited data plans in finland or at least they are rare . 
  why do n't they get some other party , like cu , in the government instead of gl ? 
  i do n't know much about dutch politics , but it sounds like cu would be closer to the other parties than gl . 
  it snowed yesterday here ... 
   i have a hard time thinking of an execution method which would be more effective in terms of painlessness and swiftness . 
  a nuclear detonation a meter away from you ? 
  can you trade it to my 5 \u00b0 c ? 
  at least it is not snowing . 
  why ? 
   it 's the reason we have are going from a recent coalition government to a two party system again . 
  no , the problem is in the voting system , not the voters . 
  okay , sorry i was wrong . 
  1 / ( n +1 ) is the maximum threshold . 
  in d'hondt method , the threshold is proportional to the number of seats in the district . 
  the threshold is 1 / ( n +1 ) , where n is the number of seats in the district . 
  yes , but in the small districts the threshold is quite high . 
  ~ ~ in the smallest district in finland , the threshold is 12,5 % , which is very high . ~ ~, 
  the government would probably not be that big . 
  even in the netherlands , the biggest government coalition they 've had is 5 parties and usually it is 2-3 parties . 
  that 's just a symptom of the unproportional voting system . 
  when the voting system favours bigger parties , then people who would otherwise be part of a smaller party are forced to join the bigger one . 
  and then you have big parties whose members come from a wide range on the political spectrum and are thus more likely to disagree and back stab their own party members . 
  the french political life is heavily influenced by the voting system though . 
  if you change the voting system the political life will also change over time . 
   after looking into it , i can say that the dutch system is less than ideal due to districless voting . 
  i think it is good that they do n't have districts . 
  finland uses the d'hondt method , which would produce similar results as the dutch system , except because of districts the theoretical threshold is much higher in finland . 
  in my opinion it is not really important that the mp 's in the national parliament are equally distributed across the country , because that 's why there are also regional/municipal elections . 
  did you even try to find it yourself ? 
  it is the first result when you search m\u00e9lenchon on youtube . 
  well , i do n't understand any of them . 
  me neither, 
  i did n't even realise how tall the eiffel tower is . 
  or maybe everything else is just very low . 
  [ what ads ?

  gib global warming please . 
  what does it look like in summer ? 
  no , if you have 1 person and everyone gives birth to one person , you double the population . 
  and if you have 10 person and everyone gives birth to one person , you double the population . 
  because of the higher population you also have equally higher potential for population growth . 
  finland can not into europe ? 
  it was even larger than the ussr . 
  not really . 
  [ here 's all of them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bni9k_05bza ), 
  technically bush ii and trump should have 1 day , since they did n't win the popular vote . 
  that 's true . 
  before reading this it did n't even come to my mind that tides can be so dangerous . 
  slovakia can into southern europe too apparently . 
  i honestly have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  is `` dog 's '' two words if you separate it into dog 's ? 
  that 's basically what is being done there . 
  it is different conjugations of dog, 
  you ca n't put them separately . 
  for example koirassasi means in your dog , but if you separate the word it becomes something like koira ssa si , but ssa and si do n't mean anything on their own . 
  it is not a compound word , it is literally a single word . 
  it 's not really as complicated as it might seem . 
  and not all of them even live in russia . 
  there are some sami peoples who are finno-ugric too , who live in finland , sweden and norway mostly . 
  we still have snow here . 
  you should come and take some . 
  even the coldest parts of russia are surprisingly warm in summer . 
  for example [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oymyakon ) place has daily mean of -46 \u00b0 c in january , which is crazy , but in summer the daily mean is only a couple of degrees less than where i live in finland . 
  and weather seems to know where putin thinks russian border is in ukraine . 
  he could just plot to kill his heirs . 
  yes, 
  biili ( i guess a loan from swedish `` bil '' , which means car , but nobody uses that word ) and kioski ( kiosk ) are not very finnish words though, 
  [ this is kalle kustaa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/king_carl_xvi_gustaf_of_sweden_2_2013.jpg ), 
  it stopped, 
  maybe it is just because i compulsively read every single thread about finland on reddit , but to me it feels like it is mentioned really often .
