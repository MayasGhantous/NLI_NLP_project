  i live near the russian border . 
  you can hear russian spoken at least weekly here . 
  very few locals speak russian though . 
  one of the few places where you can get service in russian is probably the bigger supermarkets . 
  for some reason russians come here for shopping . 
   do you actually speak swedish fluently now ? 
  not even close . 
   how common is it for ethnic finns in finland to speak good swedish ?

  people just forget it after school and most people do n't even learn it properly in school anyway .
