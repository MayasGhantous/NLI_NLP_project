   this is the dumbest `` protest '' move i 've heard of in a while . 
  it 's not leftist in nature it 's just idiotic and very shortsighted . 
  lets just say most people are doing so simply becasue it gives off a `` fuck the police '' vibe then . 
  sometimes * they * should n't be let dictate the law and decide for themselves, 
  but hey , at least they got cheap pizza . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ becasue ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ new ^ ^ ^ ^ black ^ ^ ^ ^ market ^ ^ ^ ^ labour, 
   taxes will eventually rise , education quality will drop , after seeing you reply to an american regarding illegal immigration i was sure you wrote , ** texas ** will eventually rise, 
  the evil side of me that wants europe to do a u turn on this this horrible short sighted policy is really glad this is predicted to be a damm cold winter thanks to el ni\u00f1o . 
  putin will be happy for the extra gas sales though , maybe he 'll even send a few more refugees since badly insulated tent cities are a boon for him, 
  someone has been slipping too much estrogen in the germans drinking water it seems, 
  because it 's only controversial when used at a immigration protest right . 
  [ bet yet at a ttip rally bring on the guillotine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldeaekg.png ), 
  the people i see crying out on social media about this are really annoying me now thinking it 's some sort mass oppression against foreigners ( becasue they mostly run kebab/pizza places ) there are even people attending `` not asking for pizza receipt '' events so as to help anyone who was evading taxes or using black market labor even more . 
  the total idiocy of some do gooder leftists never ceases to amaze me especially when they are only encouraging race to the bottom economics in the pizza/kebab industry which will only resort in legal enterprises having to skip on taxes or hire cheaper slave labour to compete with the illegal guys thanks to their stupid protest . 
  but no , apparently simple logic and economics is racist instead , what happened the the smart inelegant leftists i used to know . 
  no i really hope you turn things around but that requires the people voting out all the people who propose their policy 's in the first place . 
  only you guys can make the u turn, 
  dude , sweden in particular has proven you guys are beyond reason , even with freaking extremist muslims who were once the head of a muslim anti defamation league actually later go to syria and join isis you still ca n't see the problems for what they are and believe in rehabilitating these people instead of prosecuting them on their return . 
  sorry if it 's spineless but when at this point you are still lecturing other countries to follow your failed example and spreading this ideology of looking past all the obvious problems and blaming the natives for not being tolerent enough i 've lost all sympathy . 
  better to remove the one bad apple now before it poisons every other country slowly, 
  80 % of the population live in that part of syria so it 's not really surprising . 
  more worrying is that 8 % think isis and al nusera should control the country, 
  too bad , better sweden and germany sink and be a lesson for everyone else than have that ship sail over here as it seems to be doing . 
  you should really learn to quote the offending comment so other people know what was wrong . 
  when you want to keep crows away from you crop you kill one and hang it up so others get the message and it works too . 
  that 's not entirely true , if you live in a city chances are you are connected up to a district heating system and get hot water piped into your home . 
  so yes gas which powers chp power plants which heat everyone 's home would be more accurate . 
  most hobs are electric though but not sure why people see gas as simply better . 
  electricity is also relatively cheap here too, 
   free trade is a net positive . 
  this is * managed trade * not free trade . 
  do n't abuse the nature of that term on such a shady deal of this, 
  and there was me thinking you were not posting here anymore . 
  wow i would have thought the ability to speak the language of a country would be the bare minimum requirement of citizenship . 
  i do n't know what to say . 
  how is citizenship gained there , i 'd assume that 's 5-8 years with no serious crime committed and you have to know the language and culture test ? 
  at least that 's how it goes here , many people who emigrated here twenty years ago still do n't have citizenship as they never learned enough language to pass a simple test, 
   and after today 's announcement that kd are withdrawing support from the current government coalition ( the so called december agreement ) , there may be new elections soon . 
  well that 's promising , there is calls from those in the finns party here to quit the government too . 
  unfortunately they is only because they have been stupid enough to not oppose migration and their support in the polls is dropping away fast . 
  here 's how i see it currently , for swedes denmark and finland is kind of like their backup option , but now that our country is going down insanity road as well i 'm seriously looking to estonia . 
  soon estonia * will * be nordic as everyone sane gets herded there, 
   working in health care , where people are brain washed . 
  is there not any sort of problem in sweden with muslim migrants refusing care from female medical professionals . 
  i 've hear of several cases in germany already, 
   i just do n't understand how they let this happen to them . 
  it 's shocking . 
  they do n't , they vote for sd and get called nazi 's at every opportunity so in effect they are the silent 25 % ( if recent polls are accurate ), 
   it 's inherent to the capitalist system that economies need to grow so in other words a ponzi scheme, 
  i 'd gladly work for the rest of my days while i 'm fit to do so , or perhaps have kids who can take care of me . 
  if that fails there is always my own savings and when they run out euthanasia . 
  migrants ca n't vote unless you are silly enough to give them citizenship for nothing, 
  i 'd much rather spend the winter on the beach in turkey than a tent in sweden , these people will riot and swedes will blame themselves for their failings and promise to take twice as many more to say sorry, 
  75 % of the time i fly i see the checking the name on the passport/id against the name on the boarding card at the gate as you board the plane . 
  swedish language is indeed redicilous . 
  if they struggle with `` g `` s and `` j `` s i think finns struggle most with `` p `` s and `` b `` s my english friend `` barry '' is basically `` parri '' or in the most unfortunate case where someone reads it `` parru '', 
  moderators can still make automoderator rules to remove all posts by a specific user effectively shaddowbanning someone from one subreddit, 
  nor should it be changed bu a few hundred people who think they know better and are susceptible to corruption, 
   when they are the victims they leverage international law maybe the eu should start leveraging international law , pushing back boats , closing borders , scraping `` quota 's '' and enforcing the rules then . 
  the eu has let down the countries that form it not the other way around, 
  well i do n't believe constitution should be change without a referendum in a perfect case, 
  exactly , so it was n't voted on by 2/3 of the population then . 
  representative democracy is n't a catch all term to say something represents the will of the people . 
  sometimes unpredictable shit happens and you ca n't expect politicians to reflect all your views on them in advance . 
   2/3 of the voters put anti-discrimination clauses into the constitution so there was a referendum on these laws then was there ? 
  i do n't know if this is an ethical or good idea without clear legislation on how peoples dna can be used in future . 
  what if framing the perfect crime now involves collecting a bit of dandruff from the person you want to frame or what if in the future some estonian goes on to be a picasso , tesla or casanova and after perfecting cloning and methods of getting pregnant via dna millions of women are having children without my will after death . 
  ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ smoking ^ ^ ^ weed, 
  music and food are two things that can cross any culture without prejustice . 
  well i 'm on the outskirts of the city and it 's not like i did n't see them before from this location . 
  maybe i just missed it earlier, 
  to the endless stack of youtube videos it is for an hour or two then . 
  wat , you just made me go outside into tampere cold and i can see jack shit . 
  it was vaguely less dark in the middle of the sky and that was about it . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ea0dv3v.jpg year 2020 : it 's sad but i hear thanks to pc culture this is going to have to be destroyed becasue the media said we are all white supremacist nazis ... * sigh *, 
  tfw russia watches out for it 's citizens better than europe does . 
  if it was me i 'd put the other unemployed refugees to work and have them build some log cabins but that 's another matter, 
   nothing else matters . 
  that 's a shame , i hope the project to make sure swedish farts do n't smell does n't lose attention, 
  it 's hard to say what 's better . 
  as someone sick of the eu after this migrant disaster if britain leaves on one hand it will make it easier and more likely for other countries to follow their path but on the other side germoney will be even more powerful to force their crap on the rest of us ,, 
  country : finland favourite neighbour : estonia least favourite neighbour : swedenstan, 
  tents with heaters in sub zero temperatures seems like a great way to waste energy . 
  well urine is composed of urea so you 're not entirely wrong . 
  just realized i mixed up the meaning of diverse and adultery . 
  that was amateur but still pretty bad for cheating . 
   delving deeper into the moral views of both sharia and non-sharia supporters , research by pew indicates that 40 % of the roughly 1124 million muslims in the countries the question was asked support the execution of anyone who commits apostasy by abandoning faith in islam . 
  this translates into just over 454 million people who hold this view . 
  *  ** in the case of adultery , the applicable percentage is 52 % ** , or the equivalent of roughly 581 million people , who favor execution as the punishment . 
  sorry i missed the cpu bit not knowing germany party names . 
  still it 's pretty ironic how people who presumably preach tolerance toward refugees would spout such hatred toward someone for no reason only what they believe and ca n't prove and i can say i 've been called a racist in some similar facebook discussion for linking to an actual pew poll showing over 50 % of muslims support the death penalty for divorce . 
  have you got any sort of source to back that up , it seems like a semi relevant detail if it can be proven ? 
  if not well at worst i would say you were victim blaming based on her political beliefs . 
  you said it , i do n't know is it a european thing but compared to other cultures we have this habit of being really tolerant , saying `` yea thats bad but do n't do it again '' but then out of nowhere we are liable to flip the fuck out completely no holes barred . 
  i was under the impression a subtitle was ok by title rules . 
  ok will resubmit then but this would appear to be a new policy if so, 
  i think i 'm not going to bother arguing with someone who 's entire recent post history is almost defending this one plane . 
  you clearly have your mind made up despite the fact leaked reports which david axe cites actually is testimony of a pilot not just some pundit . 
  but yea i 'm sure everyone was wrong and you will be right but i have to say you are crazy when you say it 's better than the pak-fa when even the makers are now saying `` it 's not meant to be an air superiority fighter anyway ''  personally i wish we could get twice the amount of russia 's new stealth fighter for the price of that f-35 garbage, 
  it 's not nearly on par , the pak-fa is up there with the f22 and even beats it in some regards while suffering on others regarding the f-35 and it 's supposed supremacy they say 18 % of bvr missile launches hit the target so even if it 's stealth and avionics ( which i believe are overrated ) work as advertised there is still a good chance it will get into dogfight territory where it was destroyed by the f16 it 's replacing or as the test pilot remarked that `` it had pretty much no place fighting other aircraft within visual range . '',
