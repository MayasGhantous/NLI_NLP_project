you should start using that instead of `` maja '' so we would n't be so lonely !, 
  forever alone once again . 
  `` santa '' good to see lithuanians know what 's up . 
  but in our defence they 're just so goofy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg&amp;ab_channel=sherlockian, 
  interviewer : `` how did you feel this morning ? '', 
  worker : `` well what do you think ? 
  in the morning i came to work in high spirits . 
  but now i 'm pissed '' ( in this context not necessarily `` pissed '' as in angry but as a combination of angry and sad ) on that day he received the news that the factory he works in will be shut down . 
  kinda like communism, 
  our power grows, 
  ya , with ur mum, 
  probably does n't know what it is, 
  me too thanks, 
  [ nohhh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldz6hlgrqvk&amp;ab_channel=xmiglox ), 
  [ ohhhh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=279ycpjclig&amp;ab_channel=xmiglox ), 
  [ finns were much involved in the animated series as well but yes it was a multinational cooperation ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/moomin_ ( 1990_tv_series ) ), 
  [ oh the scary memories ] ( https://youtu.be/jhyr8kd2uuw ), 
  to our russian brothers , you may come to our country , you may live in the zoo hahaha,

  because i 've seen a few good ones but also a lot of bad ones, 
  i was sceptical at first but it turned out to be great , 
  i 'll commit suicide as a reparation . 
  suicide is everywhere in finland . 
  even in the coat of arms . 
  ah , one of my early ancestors apparently came from scotland to help build that thing . 
  that practically makes me the owner , right ? 
  [ this video will make you not want it anymore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5fqzhv0pou&amp;ab_channel=unclesampatriot ), 
  was that a challenge ? 
  they still have a great cultural scene , but because of the partial return of the east-west division cultural exchange has shrunken enormously . 
  it 's a damn shame . 
  you 're really planning ahead there . 
  i sense that the uk will have the jam market monopoly in the near future . 
  i get what you mean . 
  being nordic just takes into account many more things than just language . 
  the nordic countries share a lot of history and political coherence , and these are more important factors than language . 
  you might be thinking `` skandinavian '' finland is nordic, 
  finnish ministers have resigned from less . 
  i 'll enjoy watching him try to get out of this mess . 
  kek, 
  a cruise company in finland is currently examining the possibility of a riga-helsinki cruise route . 
  i 'd be very happy about this , riga is a very nice city and many more finns should experience it in my opinion . 
  it was also funny to see finnish companies like hesburger operating there , did n't realize that many nordic companies rushed into the baltics when they became independent and started operating there . 
  nice place !, 
  * all hail the northern cock-and-balls union *, 
  we have n't even touched 30c where i live ... 
  so this does n't take the population into account ? 
  the north ca n't be that thin . 
  very protestant aestethic, 
  it is now, 
  as you can see from this map , it has been decided that finland shall be *** the world leader !, 
  similar but a little shittier i guess as always, 
  it 's nice but you 'll also have to endure the winter when it can get to -20 c !, 
  my condolences, 
  text translated : the weekend glows red on the map - on sunday temperatures will reach +20 c almost everywhere in the country . 
  northern lapland excluded , sunday will have 20 degrees or even more everywhere in the country . 
  ( finlands cause is ours ) the campaign tried to rally support from swedish volunteers after finland was invaded by the soviet union in 1939 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2mhim7y.jpg ), 
  what a majestic lil ' sausage, 
  looks like a map of some science fiction craters, 
  it feels like wildfire !, 
  finns want to move to spain during winter . 
  spaniards want to move to finland during summer ? 
  i feel there are deals to be made here . 
  as always, 
  ah allright thanks . 
  makes sense . 
  standardized finnish has similar elements . 
  i think you got it the other way around . 
  as far as i know , the swedish spoken in sweden considered to be `` proper '' swedish is called `` rikssvenska '' . 
  the dialects spoken in finland are categorized simply as `` finlandssvenska '' . 
  yeah , i guess they included the swedish-speaking-finn population to it which is highly inaccurate . 
  fennoswedes just happen to speak swedish , they 're still finns . 
  yeah , so was bj\u00f6rn wahlroos . 
  that was a long time ago . 
  yeah i just edited my comment . 
  the current government can only form the smallest possible majority ( 101 parliament seats ) with 2 smaller parties now , so i hope new elections will happen . 
  damn it you were 1 min faster than me . 
  anyway i 'm quite happy of this as i 'm sick and tired of this right wing lunacy !, 
  edit : and i really hope this will result in a new election . 
  otherwise nothing will probably change although the goverment ca n't get a majority without some new parties . 
  we 're a bit different from the other nordics once again ... could n't we just had something like `` so swagalicious '' etc ? 
  at least we 're not latvia though . . 
  but finns speak drunk finnish in estonia, 
  only number i know is 6-1, 
  are you from \u00c5land ? 
  this might be a dumb question but since \u00c5land does n't have it 's own foreign policy , how closely do people there follow what the finnish president is doing/saying/meeting etc ? 
  mauno koivisto was the last finnish president with significant political power . 
  during and after his tenure the powers of the presidency were greatly diminished , something he himself approved and endorsed . 
  today the presidents role is mostly ceremonial , but when he was first elected finland was still a semi-presidential country . 
  they call their magic wands `` baguette magique '', 
  i really do n't think greece does n't admit it 's fucked itself like the analogy suggests . 
  from what i have heard the problem is that the `` solutions '' to the greek crisis offered by the eu are not actually helping at all , they gave the first loans just to make their banks get their money back , and now they just keep on giving . 
  a bankrupt state can not fix itself with just loan money . 
  what , other countries do n't do this ? 
  how do they make laws then ? 
  is this just a nordic thing ? 
  unofficial finnish motto right here, 
  like c\u00e9line dion , karma chameleon, 
  * desire to guillotine intensifies *, 
  finland can into prosperity again ?
