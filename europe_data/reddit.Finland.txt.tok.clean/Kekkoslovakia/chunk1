i find it funny how everyone agrees that we need to confront islamism yet western governments do the exact opposite . 
  regime change in the middle east removes strong leaders who protect secularism and know how to keep islamism in check . 
  number of suicide bombings around the world surged 94 % in 2014 . http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.635193 in iraq , there were zero suicide attacks in the country 's history until 2003 when america invaded . 
  since then , there have been 1,892 . 
  in syria , there were zero suicide attacks in the country 's history prior to 2012 . 
  in libya , there were zero suicide attacks in the country 's history prior to removing gaddafi . 
  in pakistan , there was one suicide attack in the 14 years before 9/11 . 
  in the fourteen years since , there have been 486 . 
  the so-called war on terror and forced regime changes created islamist terrorists where there were none before and made the world a much worse place .

  why finland police fuck estonia ? 
  now you know why attacking finland is a bad idea .

   canadians and americans ca n't get work permits to the eu while economic migrants from eritrea can get citizenship to sweden with a little song and dance . 
  it is ridiculous . 
  this claim is total bullshit . 
  if you have education/skills that are needed in an eu country then you can get a job and residence fairly easily . 
  if you think an uneducated refugee from eritrea/iraq is taking up your place in the swedish/finnish/german job market then perhaps you should rethink what you 've done with your life . 
  nah , these stories disappear from the news quite fast . 
  the feeling i get is that all violations are provocative whether intended or not and are seen as a sign of disrespect . 
  we 're a small country and do our best to stay fairly neutral . 
  the time that the american planes spent in our airspace was also quite long at [ 15 minutes vs 1 minute ] ( http://www.finlandtimes.fi/national/2015/08/24/19645/2-us-aircraft-suspected-of-violating-finnish-airspace ) for the russian violation . 
  another nato country poland also violated our airspace earlier in the year . 
   5 ) support tolerance and multiculturalism and make sure there are programs for minority and special groups well no shit . 
  finland is a multicultural country and always has been . 
  we have news on yle in finnish , sign languages , swedish , sami , english and russian . 
   6 ) promote cultural exchange and upkeep programming aimed at other countries what 's wrong with this ? 
  most of what is on our tv and radios is american or british culture anyway . 
  if we can successfully export some of our local programmes to other countries then it 's a win for us . 
  just to provide some perspective before people let their imaginations run wild again , watch this channel 4 video that shows what the boats look like and describes who their `` captains '' are . 
  http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/channel-4-presenter-interrupts-news-report-to-help-refugees-ashore/ar-aaeboq1?ocid=spartanntp in the case of this video , the drivers of the boats are n't human smugglers , they 're refugees themselves . 
  once they get on land , they leave the rubber boat behind and locals deflate the boats and salvage the valuable engines left behind . 
  i just gave you the history of finland 's independent resistance against the soviets over the last 100 years with sources and all you can come back with are unsources yeah but . . buts . 
  we kept the soviets at bay by fully paying our war debt owed to them and maintaining a finnish-soviet status quo through [ the agreement of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) which cemented our [ neutrality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paasikivi%e2%80%93kekkonen_line ) during the cold war . 
  please enlighten me on how america saved us from soviets ? 
  did america or britain help us when we were fighting soviet backed forces during our [ civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war ) after independence ? 
  when the soviets attacked us during the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) there was no help from britain or america . 
  why do you think we sided with nazi germany during wwii ? 
  was it because we [ hated jews ] ( http://www.jta.org/2007/03/12/archive/a-short-but-convoluted-history-for-finlands-jewish-community ) ? 
  no , we did it because [ there was no help from britain or america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war#finland_and_western_allies ) . 
  the only reason we were safe during post wwii soviet times was because we were a near dictatorship under the leadership of [ urho kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) ( hence my name , the [ nickname ] ( https://instagram.com/explore/tags/kekkoslovakia/ ) our country had during his rule 1956-1981 ) . 
  we pursued the policy of [ finlandization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) and kept our independence . 
  i find your claim to be extremely racist and insulting . 
  the fact that you would take a discussion from one thread to a completely unrelated thread just shows your level of immaturity . 
  my views not corresponding with yours does n't give you the right to question my ethnicity . 
  if i were to sink to your level i would have called you a polish `` brit '' or something similar but thankfully i 'm not on your level . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymnfyxvidam ), 
  catalonia is the richest region of spain . 
  they want to control their own money . 
  i much prefer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120qolsfu, 
  in other news : water is still wet . 
  neither does it make you look like anything less than a reactionary paid troll . 
  i find it strange how you ignore all the bbc `` propaganda '' i post daily . 
  newsflash , my opinions about russia is a reflection of how most mainstream finns view russia . 
  here 's a poll by our equivalent of the bbc :  poll : russia not a security threat for finland  most finnish residents do n't perceive russia as posing any security threat to finland . 
  according to a new survey by national broadcaster yle , just one-third of finns say that it 's somewhat or highly likely that russia would present any short term security threat . 
  of course , the standard response of someone who has nothing else to go on . 
  maybe go through my posting history before making an ass of yourself . 
  germany is doing what is in the best interest of germans . 
  after sanctions were imposed , finland still went ahead with a $ 6bn nuclear deal with russia [ despite eu complaints ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/05/finland-nuclear-project-russia-rosatom-reactor ) . 
  maybe those other countries should start doing the same . 
  how convenient for you to stop reading there and dismiss everything else . 
  that 's your american perspective . 
  our finnish perspective is rather wtf are american military planes doing illegally flying over finnish airspace ? 
  america is n't even our neighbour . 
   the west did n't intervene .

   as it often does with its neighbors . 
  as we are the eu country with the longest border with russia i have to respond . 
  so far this year we 've had more american planes violate our airspace than russia planes http://yle.fi/uutiset/ministry_us_planes_violated_finnish_airspace/8248519, 
  you have politicians who want to put asylum seekers in [ terezin , the former nazi concentration camp ] ( http://www.jpost.com/diaspora/far-right-czech-politician-recommends-terezin-for-fleeing-refugees-415719 ) . 
  it 's pretty clear who is insane in this situation . 
   illegal economic immigrants asylum seekers by definition can never be illegal . 
  an asylum seeker is a person who fled from their country but is not accepted yet as a refugee . 
  how it works in civilised countries is that each case is investigated and false claimants are deported back to their country of origin . 
  if , somehow , they managed to stay regardless of the decision , then they would be deemed illegal . 
  maybe they 've heard of our education system . 
  being members of the eu comes with certain obligations . 
  if you do n't fulfil these obligations then you do n't deserve the benefits of eu membership .
