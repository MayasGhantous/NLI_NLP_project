  they have a point about family reunification laws . 
  part of the reason why you see mostly single men is that they left their parents , wives and kids behind in refugee camps in lebanon or turkey . 
  finland and sweden allows them to bring their family over if they are proven to be legitimate refugees while denmark does n't give a fuck if you 're a legitimate refugee or not .

  finland supported iraq invasion due to the lies america came up with at the un , we did n't support invading libya ( nato ) or funding and training islamist `` rebels '' in syria .

  `` ... there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared salafist principality in eastern syria ( hasaka and der zor ) , and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want , in order to isolate the syrian regime , which is considered the strategic depth of the shia expansion ( iraq and iran ) . '' -- dia report warning the rise of isis . 
  the media ignored this important memo and some dismissed it as conspiracy . 
  but the report seemed to prove that washington ignored an important intelligence report that was widely circulated , and that the administration had a major role in the rise of isis by supporting radical rebel groups .

  despite what american propaganda media and george soros funded human rights watch tells you , the syrian government care about their country and people and are doing everything they can to keep their country stable and secular while these links i provide proof that america and their allies fund the islamist `` rebels '' . 
  all these `` revolution '' and `` pro democracy '' movements america likes to support in places like libya and syria have proven themselves to be nothing but extremist salafist islamists who do n't want to be kept in check .
