  there are technically no homeless people in finland , defined by how people in poor countries and places like usa or australia define homelessness , because if you were truly homeless here , you would literally freeze to death in winter . 
  the way our welfare system works , everyone poor enough gets money for an apartment/house depending on where you live . 
  the only homeless people i 've seen here personally , [ which is corroborated by government research ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/153258 ) , are gypsies from eastern european eu countries who refuse to deal with the official systems . 
   despite of the measures taken , homelessness has not disappeared . 
  by 2008 , the homeless who were easier to house , had been housed . 
  that still left out the long-term homeless who had difficult social and health problems and housing needs with significant amount of services , support and/or monitoring . 
  since 2007 the latest two governments have had the challenge of decreasing especially long-term homelessness in their agenda . 
  the first finnish national programme to reduce long-term homelessness succeeded in halving the long-term homelessness by 2011 and the newest government programme `` an open , fair and confident finland '' for years 2011-2015 suggests continuation for the long-term homelessness reduction programme , aiming to end long-term homelessness in finland by 2015 . http://www.housingfirst.fi/en/housing_first/homelessness_in_finland,
