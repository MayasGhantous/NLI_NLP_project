  i can agree . 
  based on my short 5-day trip to romania ( oradea-bucharest-sinaia-bra\u0219ov-oradea ) the pele\u0219 castle was the one that stuck with me the most . 
  it 's not * that * big of a castle , but the amount of detail they have crammed in there is just astonishing , starting from the very intricately carved [ stairway at the hall . 
  your most famous attraction is [ that dog by the river . 
  maybe it 's the not-so-secret headquarters of the swedish x-m\u00e4n . 
  neither the wikipedia article nor the [ source article ] ( http://www.fastighetsvarlden.se/notiser/klart-sa-kommer-sveriges-hogsta-hus-se-ut/ ) say . 
  the latter has pictures of the runner-up designs of the contest at the end , by the way . 
  it also says it 's designed by the same firm that designed burj khalifa , among others . 
  [ not for long !,

  but anyway , [ this is what it should look like . 
   looks like a church designed to look like the ~ ~ space ~ ~ heaven shuttle . 
  obviously . 
  i do n't know , i kind of like the look of the tampere hotel . 
  have n't seen it in person , though . 
  anyhow , it should be surpassed in height by the ( arguably prettier ) [ keilaniemi towers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/57mynfn.jpg ) in espoo , the highest tower being 40 floors and 127 meters high . 
  the tallest tower in the upcoming [ kalasatama district ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vrqdvbg.jpg ) in helsinki appears to be one meter shorter than the one in espoo . 
  that is , if they ever get built .

   there is no doubt that if the sanctions disproportionately hit finland , we will seek support from our european partners , '' the prime minister states .

  copy-pasting my reply from an [ old thread  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19e5ak/how_do_you_and_your_country_drink_your_coffee/ )  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n0uvbrm.jpg ) is a good humorous summary on finnish coffee consumption habits . 
  translation as follows :  caf\u00e9 finlandaise - has been sitting in the pot for at least eight hours , creating a unique consistency akin to burnt bile . 
  taste : syrupy , black like the winter in \u00c4k\u00e4slompolo , strong as death . 
  a gas station specialty . 
   latte\u00e9 ( play on the word lattea , flat ) - weak pot brewed coffee due to insufficient amount of coffee grounds and not feeling up to go to the grocery store . 
  milk or cream added if needed . 
  tip : roll a lump from the coffee grounds and stick it under your lip if the latte\u00e9 is too bland . 
   caff\u00e9 brutal - the opposite of latte\u00e9 , usually due to failed dosage of coffee grounds . 
  gets your bodily waste materials going . 
  taste : roasted anger , accompanied by piquant arrhythmia and blurring of the somewhat sparkling field of vision . 
   caff\u00e9 incorretto - caf\u00e9 finlandaise with koskenkorva . 
  in other words , a desperate attempt to dissolve the aforementioned goo into a more liquid form using alcohol . 
  notice : also known as caff\u00e9 con kossu . 
  often served with whipped cream . 
   microcchino - cold pot brewed coffee , resurrected in the microwave oven . 
  also known as caf\u00e9 lazarus . 
  taste : a well-made microcchino can be identified by a bitter layer of fat stuck to the palate . 
   caff\u00e9 con muffa - traditional finnish pot brewed coffee with added spoiled milk . 
  the greener the coffee , the better . 
  notice : pour the milk carefully with the help of a spoon so that the fine fur coating stays on the surface . 
   at home i usually make caff\u00e9 brutal , but i dilute it with some cream . 
  at the university i often enjoy a caf\u00e9 finlandaise from a paper cup . 
  but ... this is our thing .

  many places in finland have had snow earlier this year ( even helsinki for a day !, 
  ) , but an unusually warm december has melted it , save for the north . 
  there 's this stuff called `` snow '' we used to have in finland in december . 
  good times . 
  poor lawrence . 
   ** 2001 ** goat set on fire on 23 december by lawrence jones , a 51-year-old visitor from cleveland , ohio , who spent 18 days in jail and was subsequently convicted and ordered to pay 100,000 swedish kronor in damages . 
  the court confiscated jones 's cigarette lighter with the argument that he clearly was not able to handle it .
