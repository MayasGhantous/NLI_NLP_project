  jones stated in court that he was no `` goat burner '' , and ** believed that he was taking part in a completely legal goat-burning tradition . 
  ** after jones was released from jail he went straight back to the us without paying his fine . 
  as of 2006 it was still unpaid . 
  the natural science club 's goat was also burnt down . 
   j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r  t\u00f6\u00f6-\u00f6\u00f6 is there a rule when more than two same consonants are hyphenated ? 
  because that 's always the case in finnish , excluding inflections , which are separated by an apostrophe ( eg . 
  vaa'alla , on a scale ) . 
  h\u00e4\u00e4y\u00f6aie means `` wedding night intention '' in finnish . 
  sure , it 's not exactly useful , but it 's still technically a valid word .

  yle , the national broadcasting network , had a [ poll ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/ylen_lukijat_pohina_on_vuoden_2013_sana/6977222 ) , and ** p\u00f6hin\u00e4 ** was voted the word of the year . 
  while it originally was a slang word for amphetamine , nowadays it usually means `` buzz '' , as in something that 's spoken about in the social media . 
  some runner-ups , pictured in the [ word cloud ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zauvv5w.png ) are as follows : ** natsitorttu ** , `` nazi tart '' , referring to a particularly baffling and amusing case of public concern in sweden when [ perfectly fine traditional christmas tarts ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/ulkomaat/art-1288621918854.html ) were regarded as swastika-shaped by some readers of the svenska dagbladet magazine . 
  ** kest\u00e4vyysvaje ** , `` sustainability shortage '' , referring to the economy . 
  slightly more boring than the previous word . 
  ** tahdon ** , `` i do '' , referring to the tahdon 2013 campaign for same-sex marriage . 
  ** sote ** , abbreviation of sosiaali - ja terveyshuolto , `` social care and healthcare '' , referring to its reform . 
  ** somelainen ** ... umm , `` social media inhabitant '' ? 
  ** himasgate ** , referring to a study made by professor jukka himanen on finland 's future that cost 700 000 $ and was widely regarded as vague and rather useless . 
  nobody attempted to brush up on their high school swedish skills as the night went on and the guests became more and more intoxicated ? 
  because that 's what i did at a party with a swedish girl once . 
  slurred , drunken , bad swedish ? 
  nailed it !,

  it 's not the snow per se , but the fact that it clogs the boulevards and such . 
  being a finn , it 's a sure sign of winter when the snow plows start singing the song of their people right under your window at 5 in the morning . 
  looks a bit prettier than when i was there in february 2011 , during the fuckton-of-snow-athon . 
  it appears , not surprisingly , that when there 's a snowstorm like that maybe once a decade , there 's really no infrastructure to keep the sidewalks clear of snow . 
  seriously , it was tedious as fuck to traverse through the city with snow everywhere . 
  technically swedish is n't a foreign language in this context . 
  you have to study one foreign language in upper secondary school , and obviously most choose english . 
  being a national language in finland , swedish is a mandatory subject and therefore not one of the optional `` foreign languages . '', 
  i assume german is most widely studied optional language after english . 
  i challenge you to an oil wrestling match . 
  the loser will be deported to sweden . 
  just kidding . 
  i 'm pretty sure punishments like that are prohibited by the geneva convention . 
  [ ah yes , swedish women , finland 's biggest weakness .

  i 'm picturing you with a big burlap sack full of snus , like some sort of snus santa . 
  but that could n't be it , everyone knows santa comes from finland . 
  a relatively large amount of finns also use snus . 
  according to the finnish wikipedia page 14,4 % of men and 2,7 % of women over the age of 18 used snus occasionally or daily in 2011 , and its use is especially common amongst ice hockey players and other athletes . 
  people from my former home town , oulu , make trips to haparanda , while most people in the south buy it in bulk at the helsinki/turku-stockholm ferry .

  csi : finland : the drunkard did it - again !, 
  btw , it took me a second to realize you we 're providing a translation of the phrase , rather than an advice on how to pronounce it . 
  you see , my russian teacher taught the letter \u044b more or less sounds like what pronouncing the letter `` i '' sounds like when biting a pencil with your molars . 
  putting your finger through your throat would have been a pretty hardcore learning technique . 
  well , i assume no slavic language is that difficult when your mother tongue is polish ...

  they hate vowels .

  though honestly , i agree with him , i 'll take [ paleface ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbwgczjnzda ) over cheek any . 
  and arhinm\u00e4ki is an unorthodox politician anyway , opting to go to a basketball match instead of going to the opening of the new helsinki music centre , a decision that caused much indignation in the press . 
  this might have been more than a week ago , but it 's still worth mentioning : the minister for culture and sport paavo arhinm\u00e4ki made a comment about rap music , saying he likes rap with a social message but disliking party rap type of music , describing the artist [ cheek ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ejyr-ddgw ) as `` pure shit '' . 
  the comment sparked an outrage , with headlines like `` arhinm\u00e4ki made cheek 's mother cry '' and yes , it was inconsiderate for a culture minister to say such things , to single out an individual performer . 
  later , alexander stubb , the minister for european affairs and foreign trade , sent out a tweet about listening to cheek 's latest album while writing a speech for some ambassadors ' meeting and `` feeling it '' . 
  it 's like the lamest rap war in the world . 
  it 's 4.8 % actually , although some politicians are ( again ) trying to get all alcohol back to the state monopoly licquor stores . 
  i doubt it 'll happen though , but they bring that suggestion because it 'll somehow help if you have to get your beers from the same place you get your vodka , apparently . 
  hey now ... it 's also stumbling on a saber .

  for those who have n't seen it , [ here 's a comparison ] ( http://satwcomic.com/coat-of-arms ) of the coats arms of the nordic countries . 
  [ and you can still see the remnants of the blue cross in the shields of the current flag . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_portugal#evolution ), 
  a contest was held , with a nordic cross design winning . 
  the colors represent the lakes and snow . 
  [ this flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ysxrxjc.png ) was briefly used in 1918 , and i must say it looks pretty cool too , but it would have made finland the only nordic country without a cross flag , so there 's that .

  things you can say to a finnish stranger to initiate conversation . 
  the neighboring region ( lapland ) had a secessionist movement , [ valtio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_valtio ) , or `` state '' , headed by the media personality ari `` paska '' peltonen , claiming an area of 0.05 square kilometres somewhere in the middle of the woods in posio . 
  the separatist movement , with a defense force comprising of the boxer [ eva wahlstr\u00f6m ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eva_wahlstr%c3%b6m ) , was brutally crushed by the military ^ 1 and the region has no legal standing - although it 's worth mentioning that the ambassadors of estonia , france and brazil saw through the tyranny of the finnish `` republic '' and agreed to meet king peltonen . 
  ^ 1 ^ the ^ operation ^ consisted ^ of ^ placing ^ a ^ finnish ^ flag ^ on ^ the ^ territory ^ of ^ valtio ^ by ^ the ^ editors ^ of ^ the ^ defence ^ force ^ newspaper ^ * ruotuv\u00e4ki * . 
  a lot of people in general in eastern finland want to end mandatory swedish and replace it with an option to choose between swedish or the regionally much more useful russian . 
  the thing is just that swedish is the second official national language and it 'd be controversial to end the practice in certain parts of the country . 
  yeah , and look , they have a cross on their flag !, 
  ... no , wait .
