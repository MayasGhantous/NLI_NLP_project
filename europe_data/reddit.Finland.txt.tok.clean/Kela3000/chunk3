  [ i quite fancy this instrumental masterpiece . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jpr3oe96ju ), 
  quite a bit , thanks to [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfxh4-aq-zs ) that 's directed to finland for some reason . 
  could n't find any info on the cost , but i doubt it 's very much . 
  while searching i did , however , find [ this blog submission ] ( http://santtujaiitu.blogspot.fi/2012/03/diy-project-ensisanky.html ) of someone customizing their cardboard box . 
  i really do n't know how many use the box . 
  as far as i 'm aware , most of my friends and relatives who have had a kid have a crib . 
  damn it , i 've been caught ... [ pocket sand !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptaxuylbfyk ) but seriously , no , i do n't . 
  it 's an old nickname , and yes , i 've heard every kela ( and [ anssi kela ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkoiqemtvi ) ) joke there is . 
  which is n't that much ... but still . 
  also :  the baby box might strike some americans as the epitome of the nanny state . 
  ca n't people get their own crib ? 
  ** and is n't there a slippery slope here ? 
  ** when the baby has outgrown its first set of clothes , why does n't the state provide a second baby box , followed by a child box , and then an adult box ? 
  there sure is . 
  the first phase of the great conformity project was initiated in the '30s . 
  surely the next phase is upon us any minute now . 
  as a finn , the headline [ finland 's ` baby box ' : gift from santa claus or socialist hell ? 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/04/finlands-baby-box-gift-from-santa-claus-or-socialist-hell/237240/ ) in the american journal the atlantic caused much amusement . 
  oulu is a strategic point , no doubt . 
  one of the soviet objectives in the winter war was to cut finland in half by attacking from the east and advancing into oulu . 
  [ correct !, 
  not that dark red . 
  further up north . 
  it appears i live in the northernmost dark red spot of continental europe . 
  without looking , where i 'm from ? 
  i trusted you , estonia . 
  ] ( http://satwcomic.com/don-t-mess-with-aland ), 
  such is life . 
  the polish people are called * puolalaiset * , and the country is called * puola * . 
  i 'm guessing the first slavic people the finns at the time came across were the wends , and it kind of stuck and was applied to the dominant slavic group , the russians , later on . 
  i was surprised to find out the etymology of russia in finnish myself , as it really has nothing to do with the eastern slavic areas . 
  but then again , i 'm not sure how much the wends of the high middle ages have to do with the current west slavs either . 
  could be . 
  a quick perusal of the wikipedia page 's [ source ] ( http://www.kotikielenseura.fi/virittaja/hakemistot/jutut/1998_613.pdf ) [ pdf ] does n't seem to be supporting such theories , though . 
  what it does show , on the other hand , is that there * is * a lot of uncertainty when it comes to its etymology . 
  i did n't include the fen-theory because , [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland#etymology ) , it 's an outdated one :  earlier theories suggested derivation from suomaa ( fen land ) or suoniemi ( fen cape ) , and parallels between saame ( sami , a finno-ugric people in lapland ) and h\u00e4me ( a province in the inland ) were drawn , but these theories are now considered outdated . 
  and etymologies as follows : ruotsi comes from the [ roslagen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roslagen ) area , which in part is the origin of the name russia and its cognates . 
  norja and tanska are derived from their native names . 
  ven\u00e4j\u00e4 comes from the [ wends ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wends ) , a historic name for west slavs living near germanic settlement areas . 
  viro originates from the [ virumaa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virumaa ) region in northern estonia . 
  i have n't heard of the theory before ( then again , i 'm not a linguist ) , but it sounds like it could be plausible . 
  i 'm not that familiar with the latter one 's origin , quite honestly . 
  finland 's endonym is * suomi * , whose origins are somewhat uncertain , but the leading theory is that it 's derived from the proto-baltic word * zeme * , meaning `` land '' , which is also the origin of the russian word for land , \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f ( zemlya ) . 
  finns , * suomalaiset * , originally referred to only the tribe living on the south-western coast ( the other ones being the tavastians , * h\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4iset * , and the karelians , * karjalaiset * ) , hence the name finland proper , or * varsinais-suomi . 
  * as for `` finland '' , a tribe called [ fenni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenni ) is mentioned in tacitus ' * germania * ( ad 98 ) but what he exactly meant with the term is uncertain , as the scholars of his time had very little knowledge of the north . 
  nevertheless , it is generally believed that this is the origin of the swedish ( and by extension english ) name of the country . 
  [ the pendolino trains are often delayed during the winter  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vr_class_sm3 )  the sm3 had a long prototype phase before the main series was ordered , with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time . 
  negative reporting continues to haunt the series ' reputation . 
  reliability problems can not be proven , as no statistics of specific train types are available . 
  ** the train has not managed to cope with harsh finnish weather conditions , and the time benefit of the tilting mechanism will not be taken into account in timetables of winter 2011 -- 2012 . 
  ** nevertheless , the sm3 has also received positive feedback from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the finnish rail network . 
  other than that , i do n't think there are considerable problems . 
  buses run on time and the airports are operational throughout the year . 
  there was a huge blizzard in europe in december 2011 , and the finnish airports and their well-functioning winter maintenance were featured in some news stories at the time . 
  there was even a cringe-worthy press conference featuring the prime minister and santa claus . 
  the term `` snow-how '' may or may not have been used . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n0uvbrm.jpg ) is a good humorous summary on finnish coffee consumption habits . 
  translation as follows : ** caf\u00e9 finlandaise ** - has been sitting in the pot for at least eight hours , creating a unique consistency akin to burnt bile . 
  taste : syrupy , black like the winter in \u00c4k\u00e4slompolo , strong as death . 
  a gas station specialty . 
  ** latte\u00e9 ** ( play on the word * lattea * , flat ) - weak pot brewed coffee due to insufficient amount of coffee grounds and not feeling up to go to the grocery store . 
  milk or cream added if needed . 
  tip : roll a lump from the coffee grounds and stick it under your lip if the latte\u00e9 is too bland . 
  ** caff\u00e9 brutal ** - the opposite of latte\u00e9 , usually due to failed dosage of coffee grounds . 
  gets your bodily waste materials going . 
  taste : roasted anger , accompanied by piquant arrhythmia and blurring of the somewhat sparkling field of vision . 
  ** caff\u00e9 incorretto ** - caf\u00e9 finlandaise with [ koskenkorva . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koskenkorva_viina ) in other words , a desperate attempt to dissolve the aforementioned goo into a more liquid form using alcohol . 
  notice : also known as caff\u00e9 con kossu . 
  often served with whipped cream . 
  ** microcchino ** - cold pot brewed coffee , resurrected in the microwave oven . 
  also known as caf\u00e9 lazarus . 
  taste : a well-made microcchino can be identified by a bitter layer of fat stuck to the palate . 
  ** caff\u00e9 con muffa ** - traditional finnish pot brewed coffee with added spoiled milk . 
  the greener the coffee , the better . 
  notice : pour the milk carefully with the help of a spoon so that the fine fur coating stays on the surface . 
  at home i usually make caff\u00e9 brutal , but i dilute it with some cream . 
  at the university i often enjoy a caf\u00e9 finlandaise from a paper cup . 
  my favourite has to be once upon a time in the west - * huuliharppukostaja * ( the harmonica avenger ) . 
  the addition to speed ( * kuoleman kyydiss\u00e4 * , loosely translated as `` in the car with death '' ) is equally hilarious . 
  no need to even exclude football , ice hockey is the most popular sport in finland , followed by other winter sports . 
  the finnish variation of baseball , [ pes\u00e4pallo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pes%c3%a4pallo ) , is the national sport and also quite popular . 
  other than that , rallying and f1 are popular spectator sports . 
  another name for this kind of accent is `` tankero-english '' which comes from a story about a former prime minister ahti karjalainen , known for his thick finnish accent when speaking english , commenting on his visit to a zoo in kenya to a reporter by saying that his favourite animal there was the * tankero * . 
  the reporter was confused at first , but then was clarified that mr. karjalainen referred to a sign he saw saying that `` all animals are * dangerous * '' . 
  this might be an urban legend , but the prime minister was nevertheless the butt of these jokes in the 70 's due to his manner of using the english language . 
  exactly . 
  we call a strong finnish accent [ rally driver 's english .

  [ this former power plant ] ( http://kuvat.kaleva.fi/default/203f15e4-4b2c-11e2-975f-12313b053908/large-toppila_tiiaitamies.jpg ) is located near it , and both of them are protected buildings due to their historical significance . 
  the partial demolition shown in the second picture was unauthorized . 
  the building is n't that bad , but it 's half-destroyed , spray painted and in the middle of a neighborhood . 
  why does polandball have monaco 's colours ? 
  do n't know about hungary or sami areas ... but what do you think , could russia maybe give the new state the republic of karelia , veps lands and maybe a few other regions if we asked * really * nicely ? 
  i suggest we build a ludicrously sized bridge from helsinki to tallinn to connect the countries and form a new one . 
  we shall call it the united uralic states .
