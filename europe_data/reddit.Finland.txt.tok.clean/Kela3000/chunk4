  ball is in your court now , estonians . 
  yeah , i went to romania via hungary last year , and a cab ride from the budapest airport to the train station was 5800 forints . 
  i can confirm . 
  studio julmahuvi ( studio cruel amusement ) is a notable exception . 
  i do n't think there are official subtitled versions available , and some of the jokes would be lost in translation anyway , but there are a few fan-made subtitled videos on youtube : [ roudasta rospuuttoon ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfg9xopkk ) ( from the frost to the frost heave ) , a journey into the mindset of a finnish man . 
  [ muksuluuri ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5nv1ps2dfq ) ( kiddie phone ) , a kids show featuring the host touko-pouko , a man you would n't let near your kids .

  no , i think it 's rather obvious , and [ sweden and finland combined completes the analogy quite nicely . 
  yes . 
  they 've gone mad with power . 
  no , but seriously , [ sk\u00e5ne .

  fenno-scandinavia is as follows : sami nation in the north , scania in southern sweden , \u00c5land between finland and sweden and faroe islands west of norway . 
  the remaining nordic cross flag at the eastern end of the bay of finland is ingria . 
  in finland , swedes ( or swedish-speaking finns ) are sometimes called * hurri * , the origin of which is probably an imitation of the general sound of the swedish language ( * hur , h\u00f6r du * etc. ), 
  as heard by someone who does n't understand the language . 
  one nickname for russians is * ryss\u00e4 * , which is just a loan of the swedish * ryska * , but in finnish the term is derogatory , as is * hurri * . 
  the official finnish name for russia is ven\u00e4j\u00e4 , which comes from the medieval collective name for slavic tribes in central and eastern europe known as wends . 
  a generic placeholder name for a russian is sometimes * iivana * , the finnish form of ivan . 
  joulupukki literally translates to `` christmas buck . '', 
  during the pagan days there were people dressing in goat fur and wearing goat 's horns , the animal being the personification of fertility , traveling door to door and drinking and eating whatever they were treated . 
  they , and i quote , `` may have been frightening children and may have been drunk . '', 
  later , the bucks traveled on st. knut 's day ( january 13 ) , and because of this they were called by the name of * nuuttipukki * , `` knut buck . '', 
  the tradition of the gift giving santa in finland has its origins in the early 20th century , but other than the name , there 's really nothing in common with the scary intoxicated goat man . 
  maybe that 's for the best . 
  for example , all of you are friends on facebook with each other . 
  it must be true , j\u00f3n gnarr said so !, 
  i believe the other european oversea territories are not integral parts of their countries , whereas french guiana is , like its other oversea departments that are all islands and therefore do n't border any other countries . 
  because of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta ) , [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla ) and [ this .

  that execution sounds delicious . 
  today i had overcooked ready-made tortellini with ketchup and [ this mayonnaise-filled peas and carrot mush ] ( http://mediaserver-2.vuodatus.net/g/22175/554030.jpg ) that we actually call `` italian salad '' , and [ yet ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgu5p.gif ), 
  nobody outside of the nordic countries seem to enjoy [ salty liquorice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salty_liquorice ) , aka salmiakki , which is completely baffling to a finn like me . 
  that shit 's delicious .

  in finland , yankee ( jenkki in finnish ) is a non-derogatory colloquial term for an american in general ( including southerners , i suppose ) . 
  is used as a nickname for the us . 
  there 's even [ a jenkki brand of chewing gum ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7r0vkna.png ) , referencing the popular american pastime of chewing bubblegum ^ and ^ ^ kicking ^ ^ ^ ass .

  i booked a flight from helsinki to budapest with a few friends shortly before mal\u00e9v went bankrupt . 
  we were n't aware the airline had gone belly up since they never bothered to inform us with something like `` hey , you might wan na book another flight since we 're outta business ! '', 
  luckily , like a week before the trip , a relative of one of the people in our group working at the airport happened to mention the airline had gone bankrupt , so we managed to get another flight ... but instead of a direct flight , it was via heathrow . 
  america is ... kylo ren ? 
  well , since ' 84 , and for some reason mcd 's has only made profit in finland only intermittently , which is surprising , seeing that they produce junk food at such a cheap price . 
  perhaps it 's just that most of the hungry people go to pizzerias and other fast food joints after drinking ... 
  i know i do .

  a return ticket from my hometown of oulu to helsinki by a low-cost airline appears to be 78 $ , while a * student ticket * to a train for the same route costs 78,92 $ , student discount being 50 % . 
  in addition to that , the pendolino trains are very unreliable during winter , causing delays all the time . 
  since the budget airlines have operated on the aforementioned route , i have n't used a train once . 
  why would i , since it takes about six hours to get to helsinki by train , and less than two hours by plane even with check-ins and security checks .

   poor fuck , we 're all screwed !, 
  what would be a more german equivalent of the phrase ? 
  and now that i think about it , maybe a more natural sounding finnish translation would be `` eurooppa perkele ! '', 
  how do you say `` europe , fuck yeah ! '', 
  in 23 languages ? 
  edit : seriously , i 'm asking . 
   high school is about following courses , probably hanging out with friends , not all that ... other stuff . 
  this is pretty much how i would sum up my high school , speaking as a finn . 
  to me , the bully mentality and/or cliques depicted in american movies seem so ... alien . 
  but then again , there may differences . 
  i grew up in a small municipality , but i attended high school at a nearby city , where i did n't know that many people beforehand . 
  basically , i wanted a change of scenery , and with that , i kissed goodbye to the majority of people i had known since middle school or even elementary school , true friends notwithstanding . 
  so , i do n't know what the group dynamic was in the high school of my beloved home town , but in the `` big city '' , ( and i ca n't emphasize the quotation marks strongly enough ) i had a very pleasant time .
