but wait . 
  why is estonia in there ? 
  i visited hammerfest ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hammerfest_ ( town ) on the arctic coast . 
  beautiful . 
  had to drive thru some tundra but it was worth it . 
  well in the city centre ( jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ) the prices are like 2 $ but the cafe on the first floor in my university sells coffee for like 1 $ . 
  at least for students . 
  2 $ for a coffee cup ? 
  i swear they are cheaper here in finland . 
  well at least the college cafeteria sells large coffee cups for like 1,10 $ . 
  aint too bad either . 
  yes , demolitions training had a one-time exam that if you passed , you were rewarded a diploma . 
  if you did n't , tough shit . 
  no other chance . 
  good thing i did pass the exam as i need work after i leave . 
  can confirm , most of this is true . 
  source : i am currently a conscript . 
  well , tomorrow it 's over . 
  * ohi on melkein . 
  * engineer training for me , it mostly consisted of carrying a metric fuckton of land mines and blowing up stuff . 
  also , now i know where the city-state of ragusa was in reality . 
  huh . 
  a * warm * summer . 
  not blazingly hot . 
  it 's annoying to have cold winters and hot summers at the same time . 
  inb4 `` it 's a more cultural thing , not geographical '' honestly , i * really * do n't want to be even closely related to sweden or norway . 
  * has a knife ready *, 
  shit . 
  some rye bread with butter , cheese , ham and on top that , coffee in the morning . 
  delicious . 
  ... that might be the sole exception . 
  eh , i am not good in fonetics . 
  but , [ this ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jyv%c3%a4skyl%c3%a4?s=t ) was a result of a google search . 
  if we were drunk , we would n't be on reddit y' know . 
  it 's about 22c in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 . 
  i do n't like it , i want my winter already . 
  it is not the usual moody , dark winter . 
  people go nuts during the summer . 
  should 've started with a capital letter and i would 've understood that as a joke . 
  lowercase letter = you were being serious . 
  no , it is a laugh , as in you are trying to control the laughter . 
  yeah , my english is n't that perfect . 
  thanks , i was wondering what `` natality '' meant . 
  i wonder , what is the building in the middle of finland ? 
  i guess it is the university of jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 , or something . 
  because it is right on the location of jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 . 
  * northern fist bump *, 
  jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 , finland a city of 100k + people so it is n't that big or small , just about perfect . 
  has decent education . 
  too bad electrical engineering was n't available here but i can live without that . 
  has some decent cultural events that i do not attend , ever . 
  wrc also comes here and it 's called neste oil rally . 
  however i currently live in the more ... unstable neighborhoods . 
  it ai n't that bad but it could be better . 
  overall i 'd say it is about 8/10 . 
  what part of `` usa not being in europe '' do you not understand ? 
  / r/europe is the sub you posted on . 
  united states of america are n't on europe . 
  wrong sub buddy . 
  translation : some people just started their conscription service . 
  it 's a common saying to say `` aamuja ! '', 
  to the new conscripts as they serve their conscription time . 
  roughly translated it means `` good mornings !, 
  '' , so a lot of mornings ahead for the conscripts . 
  gee , wonder why for the first three . 
  there are no charger stations planned in central finland , eastern finland or northeastern finland . 
  i do not know how far one can go in an electric car without a recharge but forget going to lapland in one . 
  well they ban if you crosspost to any subreddit over 20k subscribers . 
  they are popular , bloody deal with it . 
  they already enforce submissions . 
  inb4 some mod bans you some super secret club . 
  finnish - native english - nearly fluent swedish - crap . 
  barely passed high school level swedish . 
  nothing i 'm proud of . 
  it 's all about saving bullets , except during the final combat exercise when there is a surplus of blank rounds were supposed to fill our magazines and empty them to incoming helicopters . 
  fun times . 
  with regular public transport , silly . 
  i take a bus to the city and walk the rest to my uni/college . 
  but as for `` school '' buses , most kids walk or ride a bicycle to school , or their parents drive them there . 
  or they take a regular bus . 
  at least in the city where i live . 
  estonia or sweden . 
  either the same climate ( essentially ) or similar language . 
  careful with that edge . 
  lets meet at the market square ? 
  a duck sure is a main battle tank . 
  cheep alko from the estonia . 
  the other two ? 
  eh , can not see them from across the suomenlahti . 
  anschlussing senses taking over you , jerry ? 
  why not ? 
  neuschwanstein looks pretty cool . 
  shitposting never changes . 
  in europe ? 
  probably iceland , germany , switzerland or austria . 
  anywhere else ? 
  possibly united states , mostly for natural things like the yellowstone park . 
  the least ... eh . 
  in europe , i 'd avoid the south-eastern area ( balkans , greece ) and then probably france , spain or italy . 
  anywhere else , china and india come to my mind first .
