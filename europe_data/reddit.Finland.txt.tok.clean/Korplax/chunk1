we have [ cirrus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cirrus_ ( helsinki_building \\ ) ) and [ hotelli torni ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotelli_torni_tampere ) . 
  damn even you have better high rises than we . 
   first of all russia is an important trade partner . 
  russia is far less important than the western countries : significant portion of our exports to russia have been [ re-exports ] ( http://www.kauppalehti.fi/uutiset/venajan-kaupan-romahdukseen-yllattava-syynayttaa-pahemmalta-kuin-oikeasti-on/9t33eew4 ) and we mainly import gas and oil from them . 
  finland exports more to [ america than to russia ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/taloussanomat/art-2000001889237.html ) , [ 60 % of our trade is with eu countries ] ( https://ek.fi/wp-content/uploads/tal76-2.png ) and [ sweden 's share of foreign investments to finland is 50 % ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en_003.gif ) whereas [ russia is an insignificant investor to finland ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
   our military is called finnish defence forces for a reason ; it 's there to defend our own borders and never to be the aggressor . 
  if we are not willing to help others we should n't expect help from others , and only an idiot would think that we could standup against russia alone . 
   we have always stood alone , and are prepared to stand alone . 
  is that why we allied ourselves with germany during the ww2 and in a way during the ww1 ? 
  seriously these idiotic nationalistic myths are really really tiresome . 
   are you really that confident in your own army ? 
  yep , there are plenty of stupid people in finland . 
  realistically russia would just walk over us . 
  sure if you think that being [ russia 's vassal state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) is a good thing . 
   do n't we already have some sort of co-operation plan with sweden ? 
  we have plenty of peacetime co-operation with them . 
   i have no idea if the danes , finnish , or baltics even want to join in . 
  i think it 's the other way around , you do n't want to have anything to do with us . 
  i have both swedish speaking and swedish relatives so i already know that . 
  if america becomes apathetic towards eastern europe and if the eu keeps fragmenting then finland could become a vassal state of russia . 
  if that happens i 'm out of here . 
  during the cold war finland was in a rather tough spot between the west and the soviet union and sweden was essentially our lifeline to the western world . 
  this all changed after the soviet union collapsed and we entered the eu but sweden could become more important again . 
   the scariest thought to me is that we might become a russian buffer state again so was sitting on the fence worth it ? 
  some countries have a beautiful winters with fairy tale like snow and some countries have a warm winters . 
  here in finland we only have darkness and coldness . 
  [ foreign investments to finland in 2014 ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en.html ) edit : [ statistics for the year 2015 are now available ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en.html ) . 
  sweden 's share of foreign investments to finland rose slightly . 
  i have to admit that i 'm little bit jealous how my nieces are growing up without any prejudices . 
  hey we still have the eu and at least you are already in nato . 
  seriously though , one of the potential outcomes of this election is that sweden will become even important to us [ than it already is ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
  i hope my nieces are willing to teach me swedish . 
  that sounds awfully familiar . 
  games are also in english , well at least [ most of them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbitex-8icm ) . 
  i 'm from one of the more swedish parts of finland with both swedish speaking and swedish relatives and i still do n't speak swedish , so do n't feel bad . 
  finnish and english . 
  stockholm , amsterdam and berlin . 
  i think i find the amsterdam to be the most interesting . 
   what do you call that part in finnish ? 
   so the finns should accept to be called \u00d6sterland , do n't you think ? 
  why ? 
  we are an independent country so it is not for swedes to decide what we are . 
  i have heard that they were great builders , no wonder our cities are shit !, 
  are they at least competent ? 
  finland turned down soviet union 's offer of joint military exercises in 1978 . 
  this may not sound much but during [ the cold war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) it was pretty important for our `` neutrality '' . 
   well , in sweden we colloquially call finns \u00f6sterl\u00e4nningar and finland \u00d6sterland i highly doubt that many finns would agree with that . 
  i guess the baltics then joined the soviet union voluntarily , i mean that 's what the russians say so it must be true . 
  well modesty is a virtue . 
  would you like to trade your snow for a sack of potatoes ? 
  very nice , i wish we had a such a beautiful old town . 
  so are our politicians actually going to do something or will we behave like russia 's colony like we usually do ? 
  i remember when we replaced our [ dial-up connection ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsnar6fruo0 ) with an isdn , it felt like space technology !, 
  people could use the phone when someone was browsing the internet !, 
  a finnish search engine from the 90ies . 
   no only sweden , in finland and denmark snus is n't even legal to sell . 
  some people still seem to use it though , especially in the west coast . 
  because joining the nato would make ven\u00e4j\u00e4-sama really * really * angry !, 
  and what about european non-nato members ? 
   sweden is a tiny country , your days of being the model of the wellfarestate we need to copy on everything are over , germany has already replaced your place as our top trade partner not that i necessarily disagree with you but you really should n't underestimate sweden . 
  just take a look at [ foreign investments to finland in 2014 ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
   knowing they learn swedish in school in finland most finnish people never have to use swedish anywhere , especially if they are from eastern finland , so naturally they 'll just forget everything . 
   the finnish nation still existed according to finnish historian matti klinge western finns felt closer to swedes than to eastern finns before rise of modern nationalism , finnish nation is a very recent thing . 
   they range from `` megadeal '' projects such as the 12.2 billion euro contract to build two new nuclear reactors in hungary , awarded to russia under opaque terms , to the cultivation of pro-russian businessmen who gain political office and then shield moscow 's interests , it said . 
  sounds familiar , maybe sweden [ is n't so bad after all ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
   the turku shipyard was close to collapse before germany 's family-owned meyer werft acquired it in 2014 . 
  never heard of it . 
  i can vaguely see the shape of my hometown . 
  also sweden has played an important role in making finland 's `` neutrality '' possible . 
  if sweden was to join nato then i do n't think finland could remain neutral even if it wanted to . 
  not really . 
  a lot of people are unhappy about the mandatory swedish but those who want to remove swedish from finland are a minority . 
  yes and you still have those pretty old buildings . 
  i hope people here take notice . 
  i know that , but as your countries keep ( hopefully ) developing you will eventually replace those monstrosities with decent buildings . 
  meanwhile we keep building cheap thrash like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/20iqy2k.png ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if our country was the ugliest one in the baltic sea region in 2030 . 
  arrogance ? 
  * our favorite past time activity is to rant how horrible our country is and how everything is going to hell . 
  that is until a foreigner says the same things . 
  edit : also from what i have seen the baltic capitals absolutely trash most finnish cities . 
  we do n't have anything like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/tallinn-old-town.jpg ) and even things [ this ] ( http://www.latvia.travel/sites/default/files/styles/lightbox/public/city/71588722_riga_panorama.jpg?itok=cwzwqhbj ) and [ this ] ( http://www.bscoso.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vilnius_4.jpg ) are rare in finland . 
  oh my intention was n't to mean anything bad with my comment . 
  quite the opposite , i have always liked the baltic states . 
  the counting has n't been finished yet . 
  even you have much better high rise buildings than we . 
   but why would anyone want to live inside helsinki is mindboggling to me . 
  yet people seem to want to move there and there are economic benefits of having a higher population density . 
  helsinki , and finnish cities in general , are built rather inefficiently . 
   in my own opinion eventhough first time i used it train was late :d perfectly normal . 
  [ four seasons of vr ] ( http://imgur.com/6wqqkm7 ) : * trains are late due to spring * , * hot weather increases change of malfunctions in railways * , * cold is freezing trains * and * leafs are bullying trains *, 
  lack of affordable housing is a problem . 
  maybe it 's just me but i ca n't read estonian . 
  they just want to be nordic . 
  but hey , we would have never industrialized without the war reparations !, 
  i personally prefer the clarion . 
  shame it ended up being only a 16 story building . 
  hopefully tampere will get something [ even better ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r15zx2f.jpg ) eventually . 
  probably not but one can dream . 
  this stung a little bit .
