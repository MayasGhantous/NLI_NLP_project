  afaik lordi , our only eurovision winner , was chosen by public vote . 
  since then our representative has been chosen by a jury that apparently includes politicians . 
  maybe that 's the reason . 
  parts of it can . 
  man that sounds awful , thanks for sharing though . 
  i 'm sorry but what happened ? 
  never heard of anything like that . 
  aka anti-devil bunkers . 
   in light of this and remembering the embarrassing tests before the one you site , where organisers were caught fielding a ground attack set f-16c with full load and programmatically limited to 6g vs light no-weapons-equipped f-35a , which resulted in a crushing defeat of f-35a even with such massive discrepancy in set up . 
  let me guess : you are referring to the incident where [ the f-35 lost a dogfight against a f-16 . ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-f-35-cant-beat-the-plane-its-replacing-in-a-dogfigh-1714712248 ) . 
  in case you did n't know that was a basic fighter maneuver test and the report was largely taken out of context . 
  i suggest you read [ what a norwegian pilot has to say about the f-35 . 
  ] ( https://theaviationist.com/2016/03/01/heres-what-ive-learned-so-far-dogfighting-in-the-f-35-a-jsf-pilot-first-hand-account/ )  it can not conduct air superiority missions as it 's inherently the slowest aircraft in the theatre the top speed of mach 1.6 is perfectly adequate since most aircraft will [ very rarely if ever fly at their maximum speed ] ( http://www.livescience.com/3032-fighter-jet-controversial-future-fleet.html ) : * davis , who was previously the program manager for the f-15 eagle , explains that while the eagle is a mach 2 class fighter , it has rarely exceed the threshold of mach 1.2 to mach 1.3 during it 's entire 30 year life span . 
  additionally , the time the aircraft has spent in the supersonic flight regime can be measured in minutes rather than hours - most of the supersonic flights were in fact during specialized flights such as functional check flights ( fcf ) . 
  `` i do n't see how that gets you an advantage '' davis said , referring to the mach 2 + capability . 
  beesley said that in terms of supersonic flight that the f-35 is still more than competitive with existing designs . 
  *  with questionable stealth due stealth does work as confirmed by several exercises , most recently by the [ atlantic trident exercise ] ( http://www.scout.com/military/warrior/story/1775189-flying-against-the-f-22-and-f-35 ) . 
   no ability of sprinting due to lack of onboard fuel the f-35 has a better combat radius than the f-16 and the f-18 ( 625nm vs 295nmi and 400nmi ) . 
   it can not conduct close air support [ yes it can ] ( http://www.nellis.af.mil/news/article/1081769/f-35a-stealth-brings-flexibility-to-battlespace/ ) : * `` i flew a mission the other day where our four-ship formation of f-35as destroyed five surface-to-air threats in a 15-minute period without being targeted once , '' said maj. james schmidt , a former a-10 pilot . 
  `` it 's pretty cool to come back from a mission where we flew right over threats knowing they could never see us . '' *  btw , do you know how it 's easy to tell that red flag numbers are lies ? 
  aircraft in stealth configuration does not carry enough weapons to achieve the claimed numbers . 
  this is only true if you assume that all shot downs occurred during the same sortie and that the f-35s were not allowed to rearm . 
   gen3 aircraft in many aspects of flight envelope there are n't many , if any , third generation aircraft that have the acceleration of the f-16 and the high angle of attack performance of the f-18 . 
   consists of grant total of two anti air missiles with the upcoming block ( 3f i believe ) update the f-35s will be able to carry 4 amraams internally and the future block upgrades will allow the f-35 to carry up to six amraams . 
   on the failure that is f-35 .

  and sweden has things like [ aew&c ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_340_aew%26c ) planes and submarines which are things that finland lacks . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sara_forsberg ) : * forsberg was born on 2 may 1994 in jakobstad , finland , to a finnish mother and a finnish-speaking swedish father , *, 
  yes .

   also not to mention the high cost apparently [ croatian `` jewish '' communities ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/finland-nuclear-investor-russia-investor-reactor-energy/ ) have loads money and love to invest in nuclear power .

  those are dolphins not sharks . 
  no worries !, 
  our government is not planning to do any real reforms and are currently wasting their time trying to remove swedish from this country . 
  we 'll fuck this up somehow !, 
  and then there 's the insane * `` let 's keep the whole country populated '' * - ideology . 
  i think freedom and democracy sounds better . 
   the latest gripen model could be argued as an equally advanced platform as the f-35 i would n't want to fly against sams in a gripen . 
  [ f-35a stealth brings flexibility to battlespace ] ( http://www.nellis.af.mil/news/article/1081769/f-35a-stealth-brings-flexibility-to-battlespace/ ) :  `` i flew a mission the other day where our four-ship formation of f-35as destroyed five surface-to-air threats in a 15-minute period without being targeted once , '' said maj. james schmidt , a former a-10 pilot .

  jassm is also stealthier which is always a good thing and especially when your potential enemy has a decent iads . 
  i like this map . 
  very nice , would like to see a high-res picture . 
  and by swedish volunteers .

  i agree , but i do n't think a coin that is supposed to celebrate our 100 years of independence is a right way to do it .

  oohh lucky estonians . 
   that 's bs , we were just afraid of russia unlike those crazy little islanders true , however i think it should be noted that we did [ support estonia behind the scenes ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fyle.fi%2fuutiset%2f3-6919284&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  they are going to drag their heels and make things twice as hard . 
  thanks !, 
  did n't work for us either , but hey maybe things will work out this time !, 
   though , then again , we have to remember that it was basically the war reparations that the soviets forced us to pay that kickstarted our entire mass scale industrialisation and national accrual of wealth . 
  i remember reading that finland was industrializing before the ww2 and that the thing about war reparations being good for us is just a myth from finlandization era . 
  i do n't currently have any sources so i will not make this claim , but this something to think about . 
  if it does n't kill you ... 
   obviously getting help from germany ( since there was no help to be gotten elsewhere ) played zero role compared to sweden 's handful of volunteers . 
  germany did n't help finland . 
  germany gave finland to soviet union . 
  well they did n't . 
   but the words `` freedom '' and `` democracy '' are just that , words . 
  i 'm sure the people who had to live for example under the soviet oppression would agree with that . 
  not . 
   how corruption and democracy fits in . 
  a society that has a lot corruption and no democracy is quite different from a democratic society that has very little corruption . 
   our culture is n't inherently more democratic than that of others at least our society is . 
   what makes the karelians of russia so vastly different from those of finland that their ethnic similarities should be ignored ? 
  to tell the truth i do n't know and i do n't care . 
  personally as a western coaster i would n't mind at all if we [ returned to old borders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_n%c3%b6teborg ) . 
  besides seeing that the karelians have been raised in russia for at least for several generations i do n't think we have that much in common with them any more . 
   i think turkey , finland , estonia and hungary finland has been a western county far longer than those countries , since not only did we managed to avoid getting occupied by the soviet union but we also defended our fledgling democracy from [ extremist movements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) unlike many other countries like [ spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francoist_spain ) for example .
