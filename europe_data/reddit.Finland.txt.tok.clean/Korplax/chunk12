  if only estonians were able to build naquahdah ( ? ), 
  reactors . 
  then they would no longer have to kill the environment . 
  i thought it was a labrador with a tennis ball . 
  and ananas !, 
  everything is better with ananas !, 
  he 's our heavenly father . 
  this time the swedish speakers left the country . 
  ahhh i 'm going to miss my sister . 
  ... tv license inspector ? 
  never crowned though and ended being just a historical curiosity . 
  there is no monarch associated with independent finland so the choice was a good one since finland was just a part of sweden . 
  i 'm not sure if this map does justice to southwest finland since it has been grouped together with southeast finland . 
  turku has couple of universities , a small collection of growth companies and the region has some advanced industries like maritime cluster and pharmaceuticals . 
  [ king paavo i ] ( http://www.verkkouutiset.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/kuningas-paavo.jpg ) is our only true king . 
  sure . 
  i think turku would be a better capital . 
  norrland looks surprisingly good . 
  a volcano would be really sweet !, 
   the mongolian navy til that [ mongolia has a navy . 
  ] ( http://nowiknow.com/mongolias-strange-and-unnecessary-and-really-small-navy/ ), 
  arguably more [ german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_ludvig_engel ) than russian . 
  also finland has its own architectural styles like [ finnish functionalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architecture_of_finland#regional_functionalism ) . 
  arguably more western though . 
  finland was a part of russia only very loosely , finland was for example allowed to retain its old swedish laws and had its own currency . 
  vast majority of people newer learned russian either . 
  did we rejoin sweden ? 
  without looking at more detailed data it is difficult to say , but i have noticed that some startups and smes have received eu funding during the last few years . 
   usually german , russian or french . 
  spanish and italian are less common russian is rare . 
  i usually use at least one bag of chili when i 'm cooking .

  the [ ol3 nuclear power plant ] ( http://nordic.businessinsider.com/after-nearly-a-decades-delay-and-a-cool-5-billion-over-budget-this-finnish-eternity-project-is-finally-reaching-completion-2017-5/ ) has cost us billions . 
  the [ kalasatama ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1808883 ) high rise cluster is billion $ project and the planned high rise buildings in [ pasila ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/4524926/landscape16_9/1024/576/c0ae2b7d7380e57535a96a95e1d3fa61/vv/yit-tripla-nakyma-etelasta-2.jpg ) will also cost billions . 
  there are also talks about building a tunnel to estonia , but since estonia has decided to increase its taxes on alcohol it is very unlikely that it will ever be built . 
   tallinn was 50.1 % ethnic estonian . 
  oh that explains it . 
  i suppose the russian speakers usually vote for the same party ? 
  i 'm surprised this is possible in estonia . 
  every morning . 
  [ liberalism ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=56.1&amp;d=53.7&amp;g=57.3&amp;s=66.9 ), 
  canada seems pretty nice , if only they played better football . 
  the second one . 
   the coolest one ... sure and i agree , but i do n't think it is very imposing . 
  helsinki is a fine and functional city , i just wish for more ambitious urban planning and architecture . 
  [ kalasatama ] ( http://www.redi.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/redi-tornit2.jpg ) , [ j\u00e4tk\u00e4saari ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/j%c3%a4tk%c3%a4saari_helsinki_summer_2014.jpg ) and [ the upcoming library ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1198,h_674,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/13-3-6384993.jpg ) are a step towards right direction . 
  sometimes i feel nostalgic about my `` homeland '' and i always enjoy visiting my sister back home . 
  if it was n't for the linguistical civil war i would n't actually mind moving to vaasa . 
  in general i wish people were more optimistic and relaxed . 
  i also sincerely hope that [ kepu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_ ( finland \\ ) ) will die in a fire . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linnahall ) :  linnahall is a former concert/sports venue in tallinn, 
   linnahall ( `` town hall '' ) i thought it was a bunker when i first saw the picture . 
  [ helsinki cathedral ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/helsinki_lutheral_cathedral_06.jpg ) . 
  we have loads of ugly buildings , i especially hate our commie blocks . 
  edit : while i no longer live in oulu , i think the [ town hall ] ( https://flic.kr/p/whhkcq ) is pretty neat, 
  why would anyone want to buy them ? 
  no he lives in the [ korvatunturi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korvatunturi ) !, 
  santa lives in the north pole . 
  no , getting our former territories back would be a huge financial burden . 
  fuck estonia , marry estonia and kill ... 
  i dunno i 'll pick a [ random country ] ( https://www.randomlists.com/random-country ) : and the lucky winner is ... latvia !, 
  denial of urbanization . 
  in finland we have this crazy idea that urbanization is bad and that we have to keep the whole country populated . 
  imo this is probably the biggest millstone around our neck since there is a correlation between population density and productivity . 
  with better urban development policies our economy would grow faster and we would be wealthier . 
  [ dictatorship ] ( https://youtu.be/3svhbmsvvx0?t=1m48s ), 
  religion - no food - nope fashion - no . 
  jeans , dress shirt and a blazer/sport coat for me gestures - what are those ? 
  traditions - the only traditions i care about are [ burning easter bonfires ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a5skbrasa ) and celebrating [ the end of cottage season ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/veneziansk_afton ) . 
   the finn rips off his own clothes , pours some mud over his chest and then just charges the other person . 
  i 'm sorry but what ? 
  ... we do ? 
  an indie pop band called [ satellites stories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satellite_stories ) . 
  here are few tracks from them : [ waiting for ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlwwaqu3uj8 ) [ confetti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voks763b3-e ) [ round and round ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrn6mileolu ) [ heroine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnw8mgq2wzm ) [ kids are n't safe in the metro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszuj0nvv9s ), 
  well for example couple of years ago my friend encountered racism when he was in sweden . 
  he has degree in physics so he is not some alcoholic degenerate . 
   there used to be a lot of prejudice and from what i have heard there still are . 
  ketchup usually . 
  i have recently started to use chipotle mayonnaise . 
  lion is in our coat of arms but the [ whooper swan ] ( http://yle.fi/aihe/sites/aihe/files/migrated/oppiminen/images/copy-of-laulujoutsen_2058.jpg ) is also quite prominent animal . 
  supposedly every finnish person is carrying one . 
  true : we are in general quite reserved . 
  false : knives . 
  i 'm trying out german on duolingo . 
  sun and football . 
   i personally think that having a lion is kinda boring and mainstream . 
  i agree , i would prefer if we were mormonts or something . 
  signs are often in finnish and in swedish . 
  for most people it 's the [ rk 62 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rk_62 ) . 
  it will be [ modernized ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/10/finland-gives-up-new-rifle-program-will-modernize-rk-62-to-serve-until-2035/ ) in the future . 
  i guess [ st\u00e5hlberg had a cool mustache . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/kaarlo_juho_st%c3%a5hlberg.jpg/225px-kaarlo_juho_st%c3%a5hlberg.jpg ), 
  besides the previously mentioned sami languages and the karelian language various rare swedish dialects might go extinct in the future .
