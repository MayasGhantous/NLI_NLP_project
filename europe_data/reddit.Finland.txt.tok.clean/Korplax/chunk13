  we have a tough history with russia , only an idiot here would n't be worried about russia . 
  [ taffel chips ] ( http://www.taffel.fi/tuotteet.html ) are very popular here , pringles and estrella chips are also common . 
  actually most of my relatives live , or lived , between vaasa and kokkola . 
  i also seem to have relatives on the other side of the gulf . 
  i have seen my father and other relatives talking with them on facebook . 
  i have never been drunk in my live . 
  i 'm from coastal ostrobothnia , originally from kokkola to be more specific . 
   in the old faith is was traditional to burn bonfires and drink `` ukonwakka '' or beer made in special containers dedicated to god ukko on that day . 
  i 'm not familiar with these traditions . 
  the only tradition i know is placing birch trees at the front door . 
  just replace sweden with finland basically . 
  this sounds familiar . 
  cool cars . 
  no , but i 'm interested in seeing how badly we 'll do this year . 
  the most common reaction i get when people hear where i 'm from is * `` wut ? 
  '' * edit : i suppose i have encounter some in my home country . 
  both my first and surnames are swedish so i 'm often mistaken for a hurri , so some people have told me to go back to sweden . 
  i have n't lived outside of europe but i know many people who do are have lived . 
  most of them are scientists . 
  [ donald duck is also available in rauma dialect . 
  ] ( https://ls24.fi/raumalainen/meripoikki-meit-varjelkko-daevas-aku-ankkaa-rauman-gialel ) as are all other dialects i believe . 
  [ rauman gi\u00e4l ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi3mynhyh34 ) . 
  i ca n't understand it but it sounds fun . 
  never been to east of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iv7clh8.gif ) line . 
   luckier i have always hated this attitude . 
  luck is not as important as people think it is . 
  swedes have just taken good care of their country , usually . 
  perhaps we should do the same ? 
  oops . 
  i misread the title as * '' ... a historical enemy or rival '' * . 
  i do n't currently see russia either as an enemy or a rival . 
  i guess we do n't have any actual rivals outside of hockey . 
  my sister married a half-swedish man . 
  i wonder how things would work in their family if they cared about hockey . 
  [ march of vaasa . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh13adv23sw ), 
  the only thing that comes to mind is [ n\u00e4kki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%a4kki ) or [ neck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neck_ ( water_spirit \\ ) ) . 
  when i was a little child ( around 4 year old ) my mother used to say : * `` do n't play near water or n\u00e4kki will get you !, 
  personally i 'm mostly apathetic and somewhat reserved towards russia . 
  i have nothing against sweden and historically my ancestors ( both finnish and swedish ) considered karelians and russians to be their enemies and there have never been any hostilities between finland and sweden . 
  never understood what the deal with sweden is . 
  i was 4 year old when finland joined the eu in 1995 . 
  in the same year finland won the hockey world championship ( which apparently is a big deal ) and finland started to slowly recover from the [ horrible depression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_1990s_depression_in_finland ) . 
  i do n't watch sports , but i think today 's loss against france was quite embarrassing . 
  you arrive to polling station , a person checks your id and gives you [ a piece of paper ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1198,h_676,q_70/13-3-6339834.jpg ) . 
  you go to the booth and write the number , and ** only ** the number , of your candidate on the paper . 
  the candidates and their corresponding numbers are listed on a paper that should be inside of the booth . 
  you give the paper to a person who stamps it and it 's then dropped into a box . 
  edit : if you are eligible to vote you should receive a letter before the elections informing you that you are allowed to vote and location where your polling station is . 
  [ here ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/quick_guide_how_to_cast_your_vote_in_finlands_municipal_election/9532577 ) is a description of the process . 
  more swedish . 
  historically the region has been closer to sweden than to other parts of the finland and i have heard from my older relatives that is was common to listen to swedish radio and i think local hurris watch swedish tv . 
  of course these days swedish influences are n't nearly as strong as they used to be . 
  football is king . 
  there are some local traditions that are n't common in other parts of the country . 
  for example i grew up with [ easter bonfires ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a5skbrasa ) and i did n't even know about [ midsummer bonfires ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midsummer#finland ) , which are common in other parts of the country . 
  edit : i suppose the region is generally more `` positive '' than rest of the country , for example the suicide rate [ in my native province ] ( http://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000560943.html ) ( with finnish-speaking majority ) is almost half of that in the capital region . 
  the region also has somewhat strong identity , for example the locals love to talk about the time when ostrobothnia was the center of trade in finland . 
  if you visit coastal ostrobothnia you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in sweden . 
  same here . 
  we also have ringed seals . 
  that also depends on your location . 
  it 's a lot better to be iceland than say baltic states or even finland . 
  i think we are slowly getting over our issues and in future finland will be more urbanized and more cosmopolitan . 
  so i 'm at least partially optimistic . 
  of course our future will largely be decided by the world events . 
  sorry , but it 's a well known axiom that estonia can not nordic . 
  so finland would become baltic . 
  i would declare war to sweden and surrender . 
  edit : estonia might also work . 
  besides our alcoholics have already taken over estonia . 
   and our goal would be to annex \u00c5land go ahead . 
  help yourself . 
  would you like some ? 
  never been to latin america , so brazil maybe ? 
  kd is the largest party in larsmo/luoto i believe . 
  hbo for got . 
  might get spotify at some point . 
  same applies to [ swedish speakers ] ( http://pp.kpnet.fi/elisabeth/ordbok.pdf ) . ^ ^ pdf, 
  i 'm a [ flying finn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_finn ) , literally . 
  posh ? 
  same here basically . 
  i grew up in finland 's bible belt and bible was taught as a literal truth in the early grades , fortunately things changed in during the later grades when other religions were covered . 
  not that anyone took those classes seriously . 
  sorry do n't remember , it happened couple of years ago . 
   lots of drinking , , hardly intelligible and very distinctive dialects , conservatism , religious hypocrisy and i 'd even venture to say gun ownership is above average here . 
  [ ostrobothnia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nr2n9qey7w ) . 
  both my finnish and swedish speaking relatives fit the bill perfectly . 
  also some of my class mates used to drive to school with tractors , so yes hesalaiset : the legends are true !, 
  i do n't personally care so i 'm not sure , but i think it 's quite popular . 
  at least our f1 drivers are often mentioned in our yellow press . 
  i thanked him and said goodbye as i stepped out of the train . 
  0 to 5 degrees , light breeze and light rain . 
  a british tourist started making small talk with me in a train ... we ended up having a long interesting conversation about economy , history and politics . 
  unfortunately no . 
  finland still has loads of issues like these . 
  i had a black friend back in grade school . 
  well i do n't really care about hockey or sauna either . 
  i first tasted alcohol when i was 15 year old . 
  i do n't really drink that much , i might have glass of wine once in a blue moon , and i have never been drunk in my live .
