  that 's not entirely true . 
  finland 's trade with russia began to decline around 2012 and after 2014 our trade with them has mainly suffered [ from the depreciation of ruble ] ( https://www.etla.fi/en/publications/pakotteiden-vaikutus-suomen-vientiin-venajalle/ ) . 
  also the trade figures with have been inflated by re-exports and by `` export of transit goods '' ( or whatever `` kauttakulkuvienti '' is in english , you know those [ truck races ] ( http://www.is.fi/autot/art-2000000500324.html ) ) . 
  no it was mainly because of iphone and samsung . 
  l\u00e4hi-it\u00e4 or near east . 
   finland true , however finland has suffered from the collapse of nokia and from few other things and not just from the banking crisis . 
  i have n't personally done any research yet but plenty of people in my family have and my cousin has a degree in history . 
  i guess the only notable thing about my ancestry is that my great-whatever-grandfather was a swedish clergyman who moved here in the early 19th century . 
  interestingly he does n't seem to match the stereotype of an ebil colonialist that the swedish were always assumed to be and it does n't seem like there ever been any hostilities between the swedish and finnish speaking branches of our family . 
  which is in a way interesting when considering the [ fennomania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) - [ svecomania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svecoman_movement ) rivalry . 
  i do n't know much about my mother 's family , though i have heard her grandfather was a swede . 
  from what i have read your average finnish person would have wanted remain part of sweden in 1809 . 
  thanks , but our history is n't actually that bad when compared to many other european countries ( like poland for example ) . 
  it is not like we had to experience holocaust and even the ww2 was overall pretty mild for us . 
  and sweden ? 
  the worst thing they ever did to us was to launch all those pointless wars that was mainly the fault of the country 's leadership . 
  who ? 
  sorry , but i have never met any estonians in games . 
  oh , well i have no opinion towards estonians . 
  finland : * omg you too are from finland !? 
  let 's be friends and speak finnish !, 
  leave me alone !, 
  besides that i do n't really care , i guess kurwa and cyka blyat are amusing . 
  we have a difficult history with russia , but i think actual resentment is slowly going away . 
  i 'm not sure if this counts , but a while back my aunt showed me a necklace that a soviet pow had made for her as a way of thanking her for the good treatment . 
  dry . 
  well few years back i had hard time remembering which was on top and which was on bottom . 
  i have started to learn more about the baltic states , before they were just some countries down the south . 
  now i can even tell latvia and lithuania apart . 
  i have been thinking about doing a baltic tour at some point . 
  and by baltic i also mean estonia ... * runs * . 
  [ toroidion ] ( https://www.facebook.com/toroidionltd/ ) from finland . 
  their goal is to compete in the le mans race . 
  there is also the [ electric raceabout ] ( http://www.metropolia.fi/en/about-us/news-and-events/?tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=5145&amp;chash=a4c2292a07986aa2263ad88db5f035a1 ) . 
  while the car is not being developed by any european company it is meant [ serve as basis a for a chinese electric car ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tekniikkatalous.fi%2ftekniikka%2fautot%2fsuomen-seuraava-supersahkoauto-tulee-tilaustyona-helsingista-valmistuu-kevaalla-6604467&amp;edit-text= ) .

  edit : i suppose neither is practical . 
  2013 rip nokia phones . 
  the 1995 has , or at least had , same importance in finland . 
  ops , misread the title . 
  i think half of our pizzerias are run by immigrants . 
  state : federal multi-party republic society : secular progressive cosmopolitanism system : social market state, 
  nothing , as long as they are not fundamentalist who will not shut up about their religion . 
  in my experience blue eyes are very common and blond hair is somewhat common . 
  i have noticed that at least in my family the swedish speakers tend to have brown eyes . 
  i try to visit my father , and my sister , couple of times every year . 
  couple of my friends live there and it seems very nice . 
  if only they played better football . 
  sweden . 
  [ i figured but ... ] ( https://d3sd9qpucc1g5p.cloudfront.net/scaler/e97e90a8802c3a717f417ff0f397812f2a94e48d74cd9738ae4e06ad149bc762 ), 
  [ finland is not listed as eastern bloc countries . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_bloc ) but then again i guess i can understand the reasoning behind such assumption . 
  seems to be pretty common around kokkola . 
  over here ( well where i used to live ) grandfather is called just pappa . 
  apparently from [ forssa ] ( http://www.pizzapirssi.fi/ ) . 
  ananas salmiakki pizza ... 
  well yeah , i saw one place that offered them . 
   we also differentiate on nephews , uncles , aunts and neices . 
  same here : father 's brother = set\u00e4 mothers brother = eno, 
  i do n't have any statistic but that sounds familiar . 
  so eu is the 4th reich ? 
  well i guess both are fine , but not everyone in finland has warm feelings towards sweden or estonia . 
  estonia ? 
  sweden ? 
  i think most finns would respond either estonia or sweden . 
  * `` uuggghhh what is that bright thing on the sky that is melting me ? 
  i have a soft spot for some japanese music . 
  usually every other day . 
  i always try to cook enough food for two days . 
  i have been to usa and japan , and i know loads of people who have been outside of europe so i guess it is at least somewhat common . 
  when finns go to visit other european countries like germany they 'll usually say * `` i 'm going to europe '' * . 
   but with reindeer we do n't actually eat that much reindeer . 
  i think moose is far more common . 
  you mean [ lutefisk ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lutefisk ) yeah we have it , though we call it `` lipe\u00e4kala '' . 
  oh please we too have those and we even have salmiakki pizzas . 
  finland . 
  i know some people , like my sister , who have learned to speak swedish and it seems to be useful for them . 
  personally i have n't learned it but i think it would be one the more useful languages i could learn . 
  i have read that in oulu ( a city in northern finland ) norwegian classes are somewhat popular . 
  russian is not widely spoken language in finland and only something like 2 % of students study it at any level . 
  i guess it can be useful if you live in eastern finland and want to work in customer support , other than that it 's not that important since russia is not our main trading partner our relations with them are quite thin . 
  ca n't say much about estonian since i have n't personally interacted that much with them , but it seems that we prefer to speak english with them . 
  people begin to learn english early on and is by far the most popular foreign language ( something like 98 % of students take it ) . 
  knowing english is considered to be a basic skill since it is the current lingua franca . 
  personally i like the time period between late 18th to mid 19th century . 
  during that time period my home region had a lot of maritime trade , for example i believe my hometown ( kokkola ) had sweden 's fourth largest merchant fleet . 
  as a person who grew up in a family with strong maritime traditions i have always liked that . 
  overall though i think i like the time period between 1950s and 1970s . 
  [ where is my nuclear powered vacuum cleaner !? 
  [ finnair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnair ) is good i think . 
  i mostly fly between helsinki and oulu . 
  one alternative would be that norwegian airline , never tried it though . 
  in the communal laundry room . 
  i would n't say that , our air force for example is highly professional and competent . 
  nothing . 
  never had any meaningful interactions with them . 
  however i have worked with many different nationalities so i do n't really care where someone is from . 
  i do n't but my father likes to play [ pidro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_ ( card_game \\ ) \\ #finnish _ variation .2 c_pidro ) . 
  it 's kinda like bridge ...
