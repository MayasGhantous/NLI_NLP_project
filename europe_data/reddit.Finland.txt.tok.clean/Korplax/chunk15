  i think . 
  i do n't think it 's played outside of vaasa-kokkola coast . 
   what is your opinion of your military ? 
  i have more faith in our military than i have in our government . 
  most of our politicians seem to be either incompetent or blinded by some ideology . 
  our military seems to be far more professional and pragmatic . 
  edit : also seeing what happened to estonians after the ww2 i 'm highly supportive of our military . 
   do you know any soldiers ? 
  what made them join ? 
  yes , patriotism i guess . 
  finland has a mandatory military service but most people do n't become professional soldiers . 
   do you think the allocated budget is about right ? 
  just about . 
  according nato 's standards we spend roughly 1.64 % of our gdp on military . 
  in near future we are also planning some major acquisitions like replacing our f-18s with new fighters . 
   if shit hit the fan and there is war on your country 's soil , do you trust your army would do its job ? 
  to the best of their ability . 
  we have this tradition where children dress up as [ witches and go from door to door to ask for candy ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/easter_tradition_brings_witches_door-to-door/9555823 ) . 
  kinda like halloween . 
  in my home region we also burn [ easter bonfires ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a5skbrasa ) . 
  afaik this tradition is not very common in other parts of the country . 
  yep , and local swedish-speakers can also be quite religious . 
  meh , it is just a really big bomb .

  though your average finnj\u00e4vel has no idea what it is . 
  that 's is actually what i had in my mind , i guess i understand some swedish after all . 
  grandpas/fathers who drink latte ? 
  in finland it 's the opposite : south and west are wealthier than east and north . 
  when the americans are here people complain . 
  when the americans are n't here people complain . 
  i 'm from a region of finland called [ ostrobothnia ] ( https://lasvitunpargas.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1288541547902.jpg ) . 
  when people from other parts of the country hear where i 'm from they usually ask * `` where 's your knife ? 
  '' * and when they hear my name they usually tell me to go back to sweden . 
  so there are basically two types of ostrobothnians : axe-crazy lunatics and svenska tomato farmers . 
  ostrobothnia is also called the texas of finland . 
  other stereotypes : helsinki : snobs , yuppies and assholes eastern finland : unemployed alcoholics and russians western finland : quiet , boring and reserved central finland : ??? 
  lapland : reindeer herders and tourists, 
  i think people just get it from sweden . 
  i studied in oulu ( a city in northern finland ) and people bought it from haaparanta . 
  afaik most people do n't really care since english is seen as a far more valuable language and most people would rather learn something else like german . 
  edit : however swedish is probably one of the more common foreign languages in finland . 
  european : french non-european : japanese, 
  finnish and english . 
  it was n't at least not in my high school . 
  i knew few people who used snus though . 
  [ lonkero . 
  ] ( http://helloamericandiner.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hello_lonkero.png ), 
  i liked the [ circle of light ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4itj7i26co ) more . 
  you were occupied by the soviet union along with the other baltic states . 
  both i guess . 
  however i 'm not a swedish speaker so i do n't think should make any claims about their identities . 
  no , i 'm a patriot who loves his home . 
  also in finland there has traditionally been two flavors of nationalism : [ fennomania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) and [ svecomania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svecoman_movement ) . 
  as a finnish person with some swedish heritage ( i have both swedish-speaking and swedish relatives for example ) ca n't say i have great deal of sympathy for either ideologies . 
  mostly from internet . 
  i occasionally might read a newspaper at local library . 
  i do n't even have a tv . 
  ostrobothnia is a bilingual region in finland that has a strong cultural and economical connection to sweden . 
  many people there even watch swedish tv and even the finnish speakers often have a some kind of a connection to sweden ( including me ) .

   finns hmph ... oh well not that we do n't have skeletons in our closet . 
   we swedes enter a detached zen state when queuing , and form a collective emotionless organism , inching forward with clockwork precision . 
  we are good at being quiet while queuing but not sure about our precision . 
  drinking coffee . 
  we are the best at being the worst football players . 
  we are the best at celebrating lost wars . 
  there there we still like you . 
  we do n't need those nasty scandinavians . 
  sure sweden has much more money to invest here and is generally far more important ... 
  when i was visiting a friend at cambridge we were briefly harassed by a couple of chavs . 
  we have people who also miss the `` good old times '' , you know `` friendship '' with soviet union and profitable eastern trade . 
   like the alcohol culture well i do n't drink that much , and i do n't know anyone who does , so i ca n't really relate to that personally . 
  sometimes i have hard time relating to people from eastern finland so russia might as well as be on the other side of the planet . 
  of course there probably are cultures that are even more distant to me but i ca n't really say anything about them . 
   that tends to lead to me happily cheering for whoever finland competes against when they play ice hockey , since i am firmly on the `` cheers for sweden '' side of the family . 
  i 'm curious , is this considered to be normal in sweden ? 
  i think many people in finland have a similar attitude towards sweden . 
   i do support finland though because i like the country , but they never win a game so it 's kind of pointless . 
  hey !, 
  we have beaten morocco , far\u00e5e islands and san marino . 
  with little bit of work i 'm sure we can beat germany . 
  i do n't really care about sports in the first place and i do n't really feel a particularly strong connection to our neighbors so no . 
  i might cheer for canada just to honor my old english teacher . 
  though i 'm slowly warming up to sweden . 
  european : ireland . 
  i like the colors . 
  non-european : japan . 
  simple and beautiful . 
  back home we have this tradition of ~ ~ getting drunk and shooting fireworks ~ ~ celebrating the end of summer in late august . 
  i do n't think most people in finland have heard of this tradition , though it looks it has spread to [ other side of the gulf . 
   i do n't get burning bonfires on the brightest day of the year . 
  that 's weird in itself . 
  i agree . 
  bonfires should be burned during [ easter to drive away witches ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a5skbrasa ) . 
  i guess it depends where they are from . 
  people from southern finland are probably most familiar with estonians . 
  now i 'm from finland 's west coast and i have to admit that my understanding of estonia is rather vague .
