  i 'm so sorry to hear this . 
  i hope my brother-in-law 's relatives are ok . 
  not a motto but : * `` swedes we are no more , : russians we can not become , : therefore finns we must be . 
  '' * edit : apparently \u00c5land 's motto is * `` islands of peace '' *, 
  get out of here stalker !, 
  make more stalker games and i 'll gladly help out your economy . 
  i 'm really sorry to hear this .

  nah we are happy in the latin america . 
   nordic countries : got rich from destroying the planet 's ecosystem and via exploitive banking . 
  i do n't get this one . 
  sure norway has oil but i do n't think our banks are especially evil . 
  good . 
  there was a yellow pixel on our flag , but no worries i fixed it !, 
  ... by using white on a blue background . 
  great weather , great football and far away from russia . 
  what could be better ? 
  looks like france is running away . 
  * do n't worry . 
  i 'm sure you can live with one kidney * !, 
   finland = ? 
  no they have poland . 
   it might protect them from being invaded , does n't mean they can go invading others . 
  sure if you live in uk or germany . 
  things look quite different for example from finnish and baltic perspective . 
   swedish speaking population lived near the coast and was richer than the finnish speaking . 
  to a certain extend this is true since merchant class eventually became to be dominated by the swedish speakers . 
  which was natural since swedish was essentially the local lingua franca . 
  however majority of the swedish speakers were peasants and apparently at least in ostrobothnia finnish speaking were at least for a time slightly wealthier . 
  the poorest people were the swedish speaking fishermen . 
  you know sometimes i actually wonder if the attitude of some finnish people is just national teenage angst . 
   this matter is somewhat urgent , since the su-22 and mig-29 aircraft are gradually becoming obsolete , with a prospect of being withdrawn starting from 2024-2025 . 
  surprised that the su-22s are n't already considered to be obsolete . 
   in sweden we feel a special obligation concerning the well-being of finland . 
  why ? 
  finland is a strong independent country that needs no sweden . 
   there just is n't as many as you make it seem like . 
  you know i do hope that is the case . 
  i do n't personally have anything against sweden . 
  working as intended !, 
   limp dick no wonder we are blue . 
   russia is surprisingly low , though . 
  i do n't think it is that surprising when you consider that finland mainly imports oil gas and other commodities from russia . 
  that is to be expected if the [ numbers for finland are of any indication . 
   there were basically no finnish people in ostrobothnia going back in history , these are regions were swedish speaking people have lived for hundred of years . 
  this is incorrect . 
  kokkola region for example was originally finnish-speaking . 
  over the course of several centuries swedish became more common language , though the trend began to reverse after mid 19th century . 
  well 50 % of foreign investments to finland [ come from sweden ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en.html ) and according to [ hypo ] ( https://www.hypo.fi/talous-kiittaa-trumpia-hetken-itku-lyhyesta-ilosta ) finland actually exports slightly more to sweden than to germany when services are taken into account . 
  the better question is why is everyone so obsessed with russia ? 
  [ yle : swedish alko 's spokesman : we complained about finland 's alcohol law due to joint nordic concern ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fyle.fi%2fuutiset%2f3-9534954&amp;edit-text= )  systembolaget 's spokeswoman elina yli-torvi ## trrraaaaiiiitttoooooorrrrr !! 11 !! 1 ! 1 !, 
   interestingly , spain and finland show both high absolute numbers and percentages -- indicating that here foreign investments play a crucial role in keeping the ecosystem running . 
  one of the things that finland lacks is a large domestic venture capital fund that can make multiple +10 million sized investments , so startups looking to raise large amount of funding usually have to go abroad . 
  thank you eesti !, 
  now we only need a map for top source of foreign investments for each country . 
  also why is lithuania so important to latvia ? 
   i 'm saddened by people like you who spread hate between us . 
  then blame your own countrymen . 
  i have heard many times of people experiencing racism in sweden . 
  and i 'm talking about university educated professionals here . 
   took our tar and sold it via stockholm . 
  yes , because the cities in ostrobothnia did n't have [ staple rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/staple_right ) which would have allowed them to trade abroad . 
  because of this the ostrobothnians had to sell tar to stockholmers below market prices and the stockholmers then sold it onward with a nice profit . 
  however the cities on the other side of the gulf also suffered from these mercantilistic policies . 
  eventually the cities were granted staple rights as a part of economic liberalization in sweden . 
  which is one of the reason why ostrobothnia used to be finland 's economic heartland . 
  please read biography of [ anders chydenius ] ( http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/2432 ) . 
   read some books about ` hakkapeliitat ' and they were n't exactly happy about the forced service on them , still did their work perfectly well . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this is just a myth , but perhaps someone who is more knowledgeable can shed light on this matter . 
  surprised to see a lithuanian flag . 
  also does this map also take account service trade or is this map only based on trade of goods ? 
  afaik finland exports more services to sweden , usa and uk than to germany . 
  surprised that zalando is n't largest in germany . 
  by number of employees yes . 
  supercell is far larger than both when measured by revenue . 
  actually it is a placename , korpilahti in finnish . 
  backwoodsbay in english . 
  it is my pleasure to provide insightful commentary . 
  too bad the island is also , and usually is , called j\u00e4tk\u00e4saari . 
  what other metrics do you want to use ? 
  so far finland has created one [ decacorn , supercell , ] ( http://arcticstartup.com/article/tencent-buys-supercell/ ) and few other smaller successes . 
  which is not too bad for a relatively small and young ecosystem . 
  sure this does n't mean that things will go well in the future , but the fact the local companies are rising increasingly large amount of investments is a good sign . 
  it literally means `` dude island '' . 
  and gibberish is relative . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_bothnia ) :  bothnia is a latinization . 
  the swedish name `` bottenviken '' was originally just `` botn ( en ) '' with botn being old norse for `` gulf '' or `` bay '' ; which is also the meaning of the second element `` vik '' . 
   the name botn was applied to the gulf of bothnia as helsingjabotn in old norse , after h\u00e4lsingland , which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf . 
  later , botten was applied to the regions v\u00e4sterbotten on the western side and \u00d6sterbotten the eastern side ( `` east bottom '' and `` west bottom '' ) . 
  the finnish name of \u00d6sterbotten , pohjanmaa , or `` pohja '' - land , gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages : the meaning of pohja includes both `` bottom '' and `` north . '', 
  pohja ( bottom ) is the base word for north , pohjoinen , with an adjectival suffix added . 
  j\u00e4tk\u00e4saari is what the island is called these days . 
  an island full of swedes . 
  then again taffel has an impressive variety of potato chips , so i guess they have done some research . 
  [ they are going to lose that competition . 
  [ j\u00e4tk\u00e4saari should be a fine addition to helsinki . 
  ] ( https://asunnot.ilmarinen.fi/uploads/2014/12/helsinki_jatkasaari_kaphorninkatu_120224_3d_render_c92_srgb.jpg ) hopefully we 'll continue to see more efficient urban planning . 
   there is a great reason why f16 and f18 are back on the table instead of the failing f35 . 
  failing ?
