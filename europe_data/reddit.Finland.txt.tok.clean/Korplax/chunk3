   can the finnish even build aircraft ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://atol.fi/wp-content/themes/atol2016/img/rovaniemi3@2x.jpg?b5oswg ) . 
  it is made out of wood so it should have a good rcs . 
  [ it can also land on water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcthjbeora4 ) . 
  can the f-22 land on water ? 
  checkmate !, 
  no that 's [ j-10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chengdu_j-10 ) . 
  [ j-20 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chengdu_j-20 ) is china 's 5th generation project and if the chinese eventually learn how to make decent engines the j-20 could become a real beast .

  i wish . 
  at this rate even china will surpass european fighter technology . 
  oh well at least we can get f-35s . 
  that may no longer matter if we get the f-35 and you stick with the jas-39 . 
  sweden has never annexed finland . 
  also ancient history has nothing to do with today 's situation . 
  we were n't also annexed by the soviet union and we did n't have to suffer from colonialistic policies . 
  finland 's situation is completely different . 
  finnish is perfectly healthy and vibrant language so it is not the best example . 
  why would we be learning russian ? 
  russian has never been widely spoken in finland . 
  swedish would be a far more logical choice . 
  our russian minority is tiny and not all of them are even ethnic russians . 
  our situation is very different . 
  nah i think it is our turn to be neutral . 
  you know just to be sure i was n't entirely serious with my comment . 
  do n't forget ostrobothnian tar !, 
  fucking stockholm bourgeois leeches . 
  if finnish historian heikki ylikangas is to be believed it is not that russia gave finland autonomy but that russia was just unable to fully integrate finland . 
  also keep in mind that most anti swedish sentiments are due to 19th century nationalism . 
  back then my ancestor was still living in east g\u00f6t\u00e4land . 
  i wonder how the 1809 felt like to him . 
  we are n't actually [ doing that badly ] ( http://arcticstartup.com/article/finnish-startups-investments-jump-2016/ ) when it comes to entrepreneurship . 
  we have other issues . 
  niemcy sounds cute . 
   finland is the only non-germanic country to be fully blue/dark blue . 
  there are tons of successful east asian companies like samsung nintendo nokia etc. . . 
  but ... but bioeconomy is the future !, 
  i 'm curious , what is the appeal of russia to some of the eastern european countries ? 
  haha eesti you are too black to be nordic !, 
  hopefully [ ol3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3 ) , whenever it will be finished , will make our energy production greener . 
  calling giraffe a kirahvi is as natural as calling a stol a tuoli or kaffe kahvi . 
  why would a well known fact need more credibility ? 
  at first i was impressed by our \u2212 14.7 growth rate , but then i saw lithuania 's \u2212 14.8 growth rate . 
  damn it lithuania !, 
  edit : oh , that was estonia . 
  our growth was embarrassing \u2212 8.3 . 
  we suck . 
  [ and he 'll cast down the false god . 
  mwannalag sounds like a cave from morrowind . 
  kaelkirjak sounds something you would find from a library . 
  supercell generates majority of our gaming industry 's revenue ( ~ 2b $ ) so i do n't think our industry is the best . 
  however our it industry is not nearly as bad as people think it is , for example we have traditionally done ok in security software . 
  for example see [ stonesoft ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-06/intel-to-buy-stonesoft-for-389-million-to-add-security-software ) . 
  pfft only because they have oil . 
  you are going to march to \u00c5land ? 
  are n't you going to drown ? 
  oh no not the \u00c5land !, 
  we need our potato chip factory . 
  did n't latvia , or was it lithuania , have a billionaire ? 
  kauppahalli does n't look very exiting from the inside , and i personally prefer the one in [ vaasa ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@63.095267,21.617709,3a,75y,190.68h,100.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1soveinit_1gknntpj0l1clg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  note the beautiful modernist building next to it . 
  [ i like the one in madrid .

  i do n't know about the french but back then [ people did n't really know anything about us finns either . 
  maybe , but then again our family is a finnish-swedish mixture . 
   based on past experience , russians tend to be lazy and complain all the time sounds like some of my relatives . 
  i can wave my hands , does that count ? 
   vene ( which means `` dishonest '' in estonian ) boats are dishonest ? 
   if i can console the whole suomi people actually ??? 
  is just the way we like it . 
  so who broke the ritual of mensis ? 
  i believe there are around 72,000 russian speakers in finland which is roughly 1.3 % of total population . 
  of course not all the russian speakers are russians . 
  i suppose it is a good thing that we only have very few russians here . 
  we are ? 
  if the brain damaged johan b\u00e4ckman ( or pacman ) is a part of russia 's information war against us then they have a zero understanding of finland or they want to intentionally increase anti-russian sentiments in finland . 
  [ yes he looks very asian .

  why is there something wrong about is nationality or something ? 
  actually the f-35 seems to be reasonably maneuverable and seems to especially have an excellent [ high aoa performance ] ( https://theaviationist.com/2016/03/01/heres-what-ive-learned-so-far-dogfighting-in-the-f-35-a-jsf-pilot-first-hand-account/ ) and acceleration . 
  hmd global and nokia are still based in finland so some money will still end up in europe . 
  also traditionally china has been a place where the phones have been assembled while the actual components have been made elsewhere , for example german company bosch is the world 's largest manufacturer of [ mems sensors ] ( http://microtec-suedwest.de/en/key-technology-for-the-connected-world-five-billion-bosch-mems-sensors/ ) . 
  of course my knowledge could be obsolete . 
  what are we even supposed to be ? 
  your ship must have a really low rcs . 
   standardized hungarian wtf brother ? 
  then again i 'm sure my five year old niece would love your ship . 
  i guess they could go back to `` basic finns '' . 
  oh it 's working for me as well now , moments ago it displayed 404 error message .
