  we are ? 
  russia is the reason why we are buying new guns . 
  plz teach us how to play football, 
  you mean finland ? 
  why would we want to buy weapons from russia ? 
  [ werr said blothel !, 
  the regions of finland also have swedish names and in some cases they actually are the original names . 
   `` mongol '' characterization of finns is more propaganda than truth it 's 19th century race science . 
  yeah it 's not that companies like [ nokia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia ) had anything to do with our success . 
  no it was those noble russians who built our country for us because we finns are too stupid to accomplish anything by ourselves . 
  it 's absolutely true that finland is dependent on russian money , [ just look how much russia invested in finland in 2015 ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en_007.gif ) !, 
  i keep hearing every now and then how swedes hate and despise us , so i do n't think he is that far off . 
  average finnish person would have wanted remain as a part of sweden in 1809 . 
  really ? 
  i ca n't understand estonian . 
  finland is not a scandinavian country , therefor finns are n't eastern swedes . 
  are you saying [ this ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/photo-diary/files/2015/02/mogadishu.jpg ) is not what malm\u00f6 looks like ? 
  finland 's trade with russia has been declining since 2011 ( i think ) , so sanctions are n't the only reason for our trade troubles with them . 
  so what is estonia then ? 
  they are just jealous of our m\u00e4mmi . 
  baka sweden . 
  it 's not that we actually like you ,, 
  but which one of them ? 
  i had to google horvatorszag . 
  he was poisoned by the enemies . 
  the economy is wearing a silly hat . 
  we are also very proud of m\u00e4mmi . 
  this is beautiful to watch . 
  you ? 
  there is still resentment and prejudices between the different language groups and we still have n't entirely gotten over the [ language strife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland's_language_strife ) . 
  edit : at least this is my perception as a western coaster . 
  people from for example eastern finland might have a different view . 
  19th century saw the rise of finnish nationalism and language so that century was actually pretty good for the language . 
  we just call it nato , but a literal translation would be something like `` pohjois atlannin sopimus yhteis\u00f6 '' or pasy . 
  generally boring architecture and shitty urban planning . 
  more things like [ keskuskirjasto ] ( http://www.rakennuslehti.fi/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/keskustakirjasto-yllattaa-1200x675.jpeg ) and [ j\u00e4tk\u00e4saari ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rfyoojebfry/maxresdefault.jpg ) thank you . 
  for know-how and good infrastructure . 
  swedish , or at least `` swennish '' , was actually quite common especially in the western finland . 
  finland was de-swedified after the rise of [ finnish nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) though . 
  eu likes to lump eastern and northern finland together , probably because of both of them are peripheries . 
  western and southern finland are n't that bad when one considers [ the old provinces of finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_finland#provinces_of_finland_at_abolition ) . 
  and more than 1/5 of people of finland live in [ uusimaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uusimaa ) so the map is n't far off . 
  well sweden never really tried to destroy finnish language and russia did n't succeed . 
  yes . 
  as long as people know how to farm potatoes and boil pulp all is good . 
  i mean people do n't really need to know math or languages . 
  at least they are investing in barns , we can live without r&d or education . 
  what 's wrong with latvia ? 
  for finland : - the last few years have been hard for us . 
  nokia lost its phone business ( this is the main reason : [ * `` like wired pointed out , in its peak years , nokia had `` accounted for 70 % of helsinki 's stock exchange market capital , 43 % of corporate r&d , 21 % of total exports and 14 % of corporate tax revenues . '' * ] ( http://nordic.businessinsider.com/how-giving-up-mobile-phones-saved-nokia--and-why-its-ready-to-take-over-the-world-again-2016-7/ ) ) , paper industry has declined and trade with russia has been declining for years . 
  - finland has unique structural problems when compared to sweden : we are significantly under-urbanized which limits our productivity , we have more structural unemployment ( partly related to our poor urbanization policies ) and most of our exports are investment goods whereas sweden has a more heterogeneous export structure . 
  - income and other taxes are usually higher in finland than in sweden which reduces the purchasing power of finnish people . 
  on a more positive note our economy is starting to recover . 
   as long as the european part of nato is still a thing that 's good to hear ... he he he ... heh . 
   the americans are literally the biggest evil on the world even trump ? 
  finland was like 33 year old back then . 
  is that really so important ? 
  why not ? 
  it will be a lottery win for us if we get the factory . 
  even if we do n't , which is very likely , this is a perfect way to market vaasa region . 
  hmm my nieces do n't seem to mind their swedish friends , so i will not pull my puukko out . 
  swedish speakers apparently do . 
  really ? 
  i had this impressions that sweden was largely apathetic towards finland . 
  not really , people tend to be over impressed by the airshow stunts russians love to do and those have no real relevance on combat effectiveness . 
  also things like ew systems are generally more important to survivability than maneuverability . 
  how so ? 
  its not like the loss of finland was a big deal to sweden . 
  was n't that stephen colbert ? 
  let 's not even talk about football . 
  they even have a dragon and a wizard !, 
  not economically . 
  supposedly if we use nato 's definitions [ finland 's actual defense spending is 1.64 % ] ( http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=345685&amp;nodeid=49298&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ), 
  i do n't think [ kepu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_ ( finland \\ ) ) likes this trend . 
   spain has lots of f-18s according to wikipedia spain has 86 f-18s . 
  finland has 54 f-18s . 
  also sweden has 2 [ saab 340 aew&c ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_340_aew%26c ) while spain does n't seem to have any aew&c planes . 
  not sure if i like this arrangement . 
  hah holland !, 
  we are gaining on you !, 
  are you good at keeping russians out ? 
  do you have many monies ? 
  according to the good old [ v\u00e4yrynen ] ( http://images.uncyc.org/fi/thumb/4/41/paavofinger.jpg/250px-paavofinger.jpg ) sweden is the dangerous neighbor we should be worried about and we should have closer relations with russia . 
  the fact is that sweden is a very , * very * , important country to finland so i do n't think swedish is going to go extinct in finland anytime soon . 
  however mandatory swedish might be removed eventually . 
  we have n't had much success . 
  the difference between finland and norway is probably that we do n't have many natural resources and most of the worse off regions are in inland . 
  that sounds familiar . 
  here in finland we have this weird ideology that we have to keep the whole country populated despite the fact that the policies are not working : as you can see from the map the people are moving to more urban areas . 
  oh well at least our economy has n't failed yet . 
  it 's the swedish name of korpilahti ( `` backwoods bay '' , a village in kokkola ) , it seems to mean something completely different in modern swedish though . 
  or * `` raven salmon '' *, 
  make russia great again !, 
  no it was some other dude . 
  it 's mainly because of the low oil prices , which is why the value of ruble risen after the oil prices have started to recover . 
  at this rate they are just going to buy us back . 
  oh do n't worry , we are going to catch you soon enough !, 
  not much i 'm afraid , however russia has produced some great physicist and mathematicians . 
  not really , only a relatively small portion of finland 's trade with russia has directly been affected by the sanctions . 
  the main reason why our trade with them has declined is the collapse of ruble .
