  in fact our trade with them started to stagnate in 2012 , two years before the sanctions . 
  how so ? 
  nokia and it subcontractors were , and still are , a large part of our economy . 
  [ * `` like wired pointed out , in its peak years , nokia had `` accounted for 70 % of helsinki 's stock exchange market capital , 43 % of corporate r&d , 21 % of total exports and 14 % of corporate tax revenues . '' * ] ( http://nordic.businessinsider.com/how-giving-up-mobile-phones-saved-nokia--and-why-its-ready-to-take-over-the-world-again-2016-7/ ), 
  yes . 
  in 2015 some russian professor dude said that after turning away from russia 's `` sun light '' finland is heading for national disaster . 
  i 'm sure the baltics are doing even worse . 
  the sanctions have been a marginal problem when compared to collapse of nokia 's phone business . 
  but at least you would no longer have to suffer from the western sanctions !, 
   those sorry finns ( what 's up with them ? ), 
  i was about to get embarrassed but fortunately you guys saved the day . 
  wow russia is tiny , is it because of language or ? 
   the swedish procurement department recently ordered 40 amos mounted on cv-90 chassis btw . 
  good . 
  i wish we could afford that , oh well at least we have 18 amos pieces . 
  and hopefully we 'll [ get new artillery ] ( https://corporalfrisk.com/2016/07/11/k9-thunder-a-korean-dog-with-bite/ ) . 
   why would double or single barrels make it harder or easier to find ? 
  [ it was a bad pun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finding_nemo ) . 
  however nemo is lighter and is probably cheaper so it should at least be more versatile . 
   russia just does n't have the technology , i would n't want to fly against an operational pakfa with an eurocanard . 
   targets are a lot harder to find in archipelago and coastal areas than oceans . 
  and what if you have to fight outside of an archipelago ? 
  facs are far more limited which is why we are planning to acquire [ new corvettes ] ( https://corporalfrisk.com/2015/09/26/mtalaivue-2020-who-forgot-the-marketing/ ) . 
  also [ umkhontos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umkhonto_ ( missile \\ ) ) are short ranged when compared to essm or aster30 missiles . 
   amos is n't that a swedish-finnish thing ? 
  besides [ nemo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patria_nemo ) looks more promising , if only because it 's difficult for enemy to find . 
  i wish europe would develop its own 5th generation fighter aircraft . 
  kinda sad that we are falling behind russians and chinese . 
  yeah it did . 
  however my niece has swedish speaking friends and has no problem with them so maybe things have gotten better . 
  dimension stereotype . 
  when i was in school i was briefly bullied for having swedish first and last names so i guess the stereotype does have some basis in reality . 
  i was referring to the state of their economy and just because they are n't maniacs does n't mean they are n't dangerous . 
  they still have military power and they are more than willing to use it . 
  a deranged alcoholic with a gun is still dangerous . 
   gdp by italy ? 
  who cares about [ gdp ] ( http://www.army-guide.com/images/smerch000wer0eo.jpg ) ? 
  * why is this even a region ? 
  * hey !, 
  we have produced [ the only movie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_happiest_day_in_the_life_of_olli_m%c3%a4ki ) anyone outside of finland has liked !, 
  i did n't know russia was that expensive . 
  i did n't know poland was doing that bad . 
  still , if finland was able to develop just fine without communism then i do n't see why poland could n't have . 
  i have heard that people in eastern finland also got to russia for low prices , though i do n't know if they buy any alcohol . 
   how many areas in finland were in a state of constant famine before the war ? 
  the last famine in finland was apparently between [ 1866 and 1868 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/famine_of_1866%e2%80%9368 ) . 
  so none i guess . 
   how many wars and with how many neighbours at once did finland fought before ww2 ? 
  we had a devastating [ civil war in 1918 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war ) , however the previous war that we had with our neighbour was in 1809 . 
   did finland ever fall under a rule of authoritarian regime during the interbellum ? 
  no , the far-right movement in finland [ was banned in 1932 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) . 
   safe landing i guess there was no black cat on-board . 
   considering poland was poor even before the war . 
  so was finland . 
  do n't worry , there are always going to be people making excuses . 
  wow and i thought our country had large regional differences . 
  so merkel wo n't mind if we take more debt to buy new fighter aircrafts ? 
  finland has both western and eastern influences . 
  eastern influences are , logically enough , stronger in eastern finland . 
  weird , how is for example \u00c5land eastern ? 
   well , finland does have a huge artillery , the biggest one in europe . 
  unfortunately most of our guns are old [ 122mm towed howitzers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equipment_of_the_finnish_army#field_artillery ) so while we may have the largest ( well the second largest ) artillery force in the europe it 's not very modern . 
  one could even say it 's obsolete . 
  we definitely need those new [ self-propelled howitzers ] ( https://corporalfrisk.com/2016/07/11/k9-thunder-a-korean-dog-with-bite/ ) . 
  would you like to buy a bridge ? 
  how many helsinkis there are ? 
  the number 8 is my favorite . 
  the winner looks fine , and she has a nice body , but honestly i have met imo more attractive black women . 
  genius !, 
  man poland you are popular !, 
   finns at the very least know how to control themselves . 
  our businessmen are so corrupt to the core due to the soviet era legacy , that even exposure to russia is like a ticking timebomb . 
  i think you are giving us too much credit . 
  from what i have dealt with our * `` experts of eastern trade '' * i would n't trust them if my life depended on it . 
  i think that the real difference between baltics and finland is that we are tied to a [ strong western anchor ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en.html ) . 
   even more special place for mannerheim . 
  personally i wish people paid more attention to [ st\u00e5hlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaarlo_juho_st%c3%a5hlberg ) , totally underrated person imo . 
   we were n't animals unlike soviet troops and partisans . 
  we were n't angels either , unfortunately we have our share of skeletons in our closet . 
  hesburger is so out , friends & brgrs is in !, 
  so what is the hungary pig eating ? 
  beaches in northern russia ? 
  must be a nice place to swim and to play beach volleyball . 
   nobody really knows who we are , except our neighbours ( and most of them hate us ) i know the feeling , hey i 'm already sympathizing with you !, 
  foreign sounding names are not that uncommon in finland . 
  oh please do n't misunderstand me . 
  i have nothing against you , in fact the budapest looks kinda neat , but i just have no idea who you are . 
   because of common history probably - which would be interesting to find . 
  finland has a common history with sweden and russia and to a lesser extend with estonia . 
   because you can share the same customs or beliefs , food , etc. 
  - which would be interesting to find imho too you mean like [ pelimannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spelman_ ( music \\ ) ) ? 
   and most generally imho - find someone that shares something with you . 
  we are happy with estonians and swedes , and maybe with russians . 
  i do n't feel anything towards hungarians . 
  again , why should anyone besides linguists care ? 
  what about estonians ? 
  why should anyone besides linguists care about this fact ? 
  so are german and iranian . 
  hungarians ? 
  stingy flag thieves ?
