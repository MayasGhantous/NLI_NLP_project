  so we are not going to be conquered by the muslim horde ? 
  man the french know how to party !, 
  why do you care ? 
  i wish we had that many pop bands . 
  better than eastern sweden . 
  i think it was changed after rise of nationalism . 
  suomenlinna is also called viapori in finnish . 
  so the baltics like to copy each other . 
  iceland : unpronounceable volcano . 
   johan b\u00e4ckman [ johan pacman ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-idq3r4msqes/vvmz14nonui/aaaaaaaaejy/ifd0p5mhtyc/s1600/dsc_0037.jpg ) is a brave defender of human rights !, 
  he 'll show those fascist estonians and ghosts and other american puppets !, 
  there are [ people here ] ( http://hs11.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/700/1305953932735 ) who would like that actually . 
  i thought russia was against facism ? 
  gj poland and greece . 
  southern and western finland have always been wealthier than eastern and northern finland and it does n't look like [ this is going to change soon ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/west_coast_least_troubled_by_forestry_mobile_phone_collapse_-_leads_in_gdp_comparison/7865138 ) . 
  those regions always have had issues . 
  [ yep ] ( https://www.vaasa.fi/en/tiedote/vaasa-finland-will-apply-for-the-european-gigafactory ) , they are also planning to open a [ lithium mine in kokkola ] ( http://sciencenordic.com/finland-new-lithium-powerhouse ) . 
  finland has quite large regional differences . 
  just lookup `` treaty of n\u00f6teborg '' , that explains quite a lot about finland . 
  soviet union used to be a really important tradinng partner for us and a lot businesses went bankrupt after the soviet union collapsed . 
  see : * [ finnish depression : from russia with love ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w14874 ) *, 
  ah it 's the p\u00e4hkin\u00e4saari border again !, 
  actually i 'm surprised . 
  i mean it 's not like they have actually harmed you for a long time . 
  i like the spanish one . 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  i mean it is not like you have particularly bad history with them . 
  baltics are more positive towards russia than finland ? 
  edit : and sweden 's attitude is more negative ? 
  this joke is getting old . 
  we did n't , but at least we did n't end up like the baltics states . 
  which is a shame since i have heard that the soviets built really cool infrastructure for them !, 
  make sure you do n't finnish your meal too quickly !, 
  i thought they were english ? 
  well if that is the case then you must also take the ostrobothnia . 
  only if you agree to take turku as well . 
  imo the finnish speakers in kokkola do n't have a particularly strong accent , though my older relatives have a habit of using random swedish words like `` talrikki '' and `` hantuuki '' . 
  southern ostrbothnian tend to sound like stereotypical southern ` muricans . 
  people from oulu have an amusing accent imo . 
  i must admit that as a western coaster i do n't always understand why anything east of tampere is part of our country . 
  actually rkp is the largest party on the coast . 
  so no not everyone votes kepu . 
  edit : also i think the division between slobs and neats follows the p\u00e4hkin\u00e4saari border, 
  looks like some abandoned soviet army barrack . 
  what is this ? 
  a castle for ants !, 
   i am aware the anemic finnish economy is growing very slowly now better than nothing , now if we only managed to eliminate the budget deficit . 
  good thing that at least our current account is balanced . 
   but really until it 's export market is back , it will be slow going . 
  unfortunately almost all of our exports are investment goods , so the exports will not rise until there is increase in demand for those good or we manage to diversify our export portfolio . 
   the finnish housing market is the biggest danger to the economy , it 's on the verge of meltdown according to the imf , and some other sources like finnish hypo-bank , there is no housing market bubble in finland . 
  also i do n't think that real estates prices are not going down any time soon , finland is undergoing a strong urbanization wave which will naturally create demand for housing in the growth cities . 
  we could always create more affordable housing in the cities but unfortunately our government is more interested in investing barns and in '' [ bioeconomy ] ( http://cdn0.dailydot.com/cache/db/ed/dbed99c114b7b76e692f712627eb1281.jpg ) '' than in addressing this issue . 
  i would n't go that far , i mean for example nokia tyres is benefiting from the low ruble , but we should definitely stop looking at russia through rose-tinted glasses . 
   finnish economy went into recession because of this tit for tat stuff with russia . 
  only temporarily , our economy is growing again . 
  also our trade with russia began to decline around 2012 so the sanctions are not the only , and may not even be the most important , reason for our trade problems with them . 
  good thing that were are tied to west , and especially to sweden , rather than to russia . 
  that is a warzone , the experience was so exciting that next time she 'll bring her kids with her !, 
  like call of duty irl !, 
  that 's what my sister said after she had visited the place last summer . 
   `` in the former borders , with the same members , on the basis of free will , i think a new union is possible , '' so baltics wan na go back home ? 
  [ last june . 
  ] ( http://arcticstartup.com/article/tencent-buys-supercell/ ), 
  yes the finnish guy !, 
  i think his fu manchu mustache looks really nice . 
  edit : yeah u/dinzdinzmdt [ did ] ( http://www.theartcollector.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/p.1.-rose-frederick-w.john-bull-and-his-friends-1900.jpg ) . 
  if you are interested in knowing why our political system is the way it is , then i suggest reading the [ quasi-democracy ] ( https://www.toivoajatuspaja.fi/julkaisut/quasi-democracy/ ) .

  really ? 
  to me it does n't look like he is too happy about being strangled by the octorussia . 
  v\u00e4yrynen now has his own party . 
  not by themselves but when coupled with other factors like [ employment rate ] ( https://twitter.com/juhanabrotherus/status/776696922518253568?lang=fi ) it is not hard too see why suicides are far more common in eastern finland than in western or southern finland . 
  there are [ regions in finland ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/west_coast_least_troubled_by_forestry_mobile_phone_collapse_-_leads_in_gdp_comparison/7865138 ) that have experienced a decade of economic stagnation . 
  i also think it 's possible that our suicide rates have something to do with our relatively low urbanization rate . 
  [ and good luck with that !, 
  good for you , meanwhile our prime minister is claiming that urbanization is unnecessary and that by decentralizing our country we can increase our competitiveness . 
  more like [ this ] ( https://www.scifinow.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hr-portrait2.jpg ) in my experience . 
  yes , comes with being a western coaster . 
  we are stuck with the stupid swedes instead of cool eesti bros. . oh well / r/latvia 's economy is going grow at unprecedented rate . 
  out of curiosity what do you think your average finn looks like ? 
  i highly doubt shipping costs are that important especially if we are talking about high value added products , and transportation costs have very little influence on service exports and these day we apparently export [ more services than paper ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fyle.fi%2fuutiset%2f3-8918560&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  i 'm surprised that nobody in russia knows russian . 
  yeah , soon we 'll drink your country dry !, 
  hopefully not , we would be the red headed stepchild in the family . 
  eu is fine for us . 
  and yet nokia managed defeat ericsson in the mobile business and the europe 's first [ decacorn ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/23/clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-becomes-europes-first-decacorn ) came from finland . 
  i do n't see a reason why we ca n't succeed in future ... actually [ i do ] ( http://images.uncyc.org/fi/thumb/4/41/paavofinger.jpg/250px-paavofinger.jpg ) . 
  edit : oh and valmet alone is planning to create [ 1000 new jobs ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/valmet_creates_1000_new_jobs_to_produce_mercedes_glc/9296311 ) . 
  maybe , but i do have swedish speaking relatives and other associates so i have met quite many of them . 
  not at life . 
  one of the things driving our current growth is urbanization and in long term our economy may benefit from a productivity boost from higher population density . 
  hopefully [ kepu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_ ( finland \\ ) ) wo n't try to ruin this . 
  just imagine if you had to live say in [ raahe ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/raahe/@64.683473,24.4795387,3a,75y,332.61h,82.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjbexsmpet6gepu0od0ypow!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo3.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3djbexsmpet6gepu0od0ypow%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d89.866714%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x46805786978a3b8f:0x40146d63c75bd20!8m2!3d64.6839541!4d24.4883649 ) or in [ kemi ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@65.7348336,24.5677915,3a,75y,302.22h,80t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scaegn_e5fljs9oiqaya8ag!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  finland can actually quite horrible country outside southern and western finland . 
  [ here a few maps that demonstrate this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yt0wt0c.jpg ) . 
  the first maps shows the need for health care regionally , the second shows the morbidity rate regionally , the third shows the number of people who receive disability pension , the fourth map shows the number of people who are at least 75 years old and the final map shows the employment rate regionally . 
  ca n't comment on other countries . 
  do n't do it lithuania !, 
  you can have my potatoes !,
