  many sweden . 
  much yes . 
  wow, 
   ostrobothnians ( pampeser ) those around kokkola seem to understand finnish , or at least everyone i have met has . 
  never been to n\u00e4rpes though . 
  and what is finland then ? 
  finland is n't . 
  but i do n't like other people , they make me nervous . 
  i think you are also supposed to boil the water . 
  [ russian language was n't exactly popular when it was mandatory . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4ger_movement ), 
  interestingly none of the swedish-speakers i know are blond , in fact the only blonds i have ever known have been finnish speakers . 
  they did try to russify us at one point , [ fortunately they did n't succeed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_finland ) . 
  true , just boil it in water and add ketchup !, 
   this old tradition is now under threat by antiwhite leftists seeking to make it an all inclusive celebration where all people can be included in the ritual , ** not just young beautiful scandinavian girls . 
  ** so they would n't like our [ lucia grandmas ] ( https://www.vaasa.fi/sv/nyheter/mirja-kristo-har-valts-till-vasas-lucia-mommo-2016 ) ? 
  so did the [ social democrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_ ( romania \\ ) ) won the elections ? 
  why are they bad ? 
  you could always buy gas from russia !, 
  so what do they do right in latvia and lithuania ? 
  and why did n't they make it 10 feet taller ? 
  i 'm more interested in football anyway . 
  the farmers would revolt . 
  why did we even do that . 
  damn , not only are you using us as your shield but we have to take care of your little bastard as well ? 
  that 's just evil . 
  oh it 's a job now , so when are you going to pay us ? 
   living in finland you essentially are a swede already . 
  are you serious ? 
  most finns , and swedes especially , would never agree with that . 
  edit : i suppose you are partially correct , there have always been strong swedish influences in our society , but there has always been a relatively large difference between western and eastern finland . 
   i definitely hope the eastern finns will wake up . 
  they 'll never `` wake up '' . 
  first of all the people living in finland , the finns , and the people living in the east have never really been the same people . 
  back in the old days , like centuries ago , western `` finns '' referred eastern `` finns '' as `` ryss\u00e4s '' and eastern finns called western finns `` ruotsis '' . 
  do you know what those words mean ? 
  also even if they had been the same people in the distant past , they have been raised as russians for several generations now , so in other words they are russians . 
  i have swedish ancestry and heritage so am i going to wake up as a swede one morning ? 
  i hope we have a plan in case euro falls apart , maybe sweden will let us use their krona ^ ^ [ pdf ] ( http://swopec.hhs.se/hastef/papers/hastef0224.pdf ) at least temporarily . 
  but why ? 
  are n't they oppressed ? 
  man you germans are stupid !, 
  do n't you know that cutting from education and r&d and investing barns is what winners do ? 
  maybe , but we do n't really have that many of them . 
  hey it 's nothing personal . 
  it is just that i would n't mind if there was , say , a sweden between us . 
  i actually have relatives there , maybe i should join them . 
  ahhhh warm weather and far away from russia . 
  so who are all the people moving to russia ? 
  true , but that does n't make the region swedish speaking , so maybe stripes would have been more accurate ? 
   is still a very prominent christmas symbol ( like this ) . 
  swedish speakers are a majority only in [ ostrobothnia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrobothnia_ ( region \\ ) ) , and if you count [ kokkola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kokkola ) as a part of the `` swedish-coast '' then finnish speakers are a small majority . 
  woah colors !, 
  what 's that tower ? 
   eastern poles and finns , wake up from your centuries ' old sleep now , please . 
  [ are you sure ] ( http://funnypictures3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) ? 
  maybe we are n't so different after all !, 
   i 'm surprised ukrainians want to work with these nasty mongols ... mongols ? 
  * jooooiiinn the eeeuuuu !, 
  good job stockholm and tallinn !, 
  our vodka tourists are going as far as latvia now ? 
  that 's impressive in a certain retarded way . 
  is there a some kind of a competition between finland and uhmmm ... holland ? 
  but are n't we supposed to be [ mongol brothers ] ( http://funnypictures3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) ? 
  i mean that is what the people of internets have told me !, 
  why not / r/suomi ? 
  you can have [ gorhonen ] ( https://i.redd.it/s732hse2h52y.jpg ) . 
  not sure if r/suomi should fight r/sweden , we are just going to sit in a corner and be conflicted . 
  so since you guys are on each others throats you do n't mind if you leave us out of this ? 
  [ what 's wrong with our tv ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98wgr0ghb7s ), 
  do n't worry / r/eesti !, 
  / r/suomi will keep sending tv transmissions to you !, 
  do not worry / r/de your brother in arm / r/suomi wo n't stab you in the back this time !, 
  ah [ p\u00e4hkin\u00e4saari border ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_n%c3%b6teborg ) we meet again !, 
  i can understand , and i can even sympathize to a degree , how russians would feel , however what i meant that here in finland we have people who still seem to genuinely believe in the friendship between finland and soviet union and the liturgy we were forced spout during the cold war . 
  i suppose that is understandable , however one should not look at our trade with soviet union through rose tinted glasses . 
  our trade with them did n't follow the principles of market economy which meant that we were completely unprepared for the collapse of the soviet union ( see : [ the finnish great depression : from russia with love ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w14874 ) ) . 
  good , after that we no longer had to grovel before them . 
  yet there are still people here who seem to be nostalgic about `` the good old days '' and of our `` friendship '' . 
  i wonder what is going on in their heads . 
  there are people in finland , including politicians , who seriously think that we should distance ourselves from eu and other western countries and focus on russia . 
  i wonder if those people are really that nuts or ... 
  thank god for our [ `` big brother '' ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
  maybe you too can use sweden to counterbalance russia ? 
  not at all !, 
  it 's not like we have a tree that grows money . 
  no it 's just that the info here is wrong , totally !, 
  most of our billionaires are [ herlins ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/herlin ) who are the main owners of [ kone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kone ) and [ cargotec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cargotec ) . 
  ironically alex herlin ( 1838 -- 1906 ) was apparently finland 's first socialist . 
  there is also [ mika anttonen ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.talouselama.fi%2fuutiset%2farvopaperi-miljardooreja-on-suomessa-nelja-3478279&amp;edit-text= ) , owner of the [ st1 chain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st1 ) . 
  so that makes 7 . 
  well there is a reason why we are such a joyful bunch . 
  there is at least one company founding billionaire in finland , [ heikki ky\u00f6stil\u00e4 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/profile/heikki-kyostila/ ) . 
  an emergency cock for those dark lonely nights . 
  i hope so , i have always had love for sweden . 
   because we really like them . 
  i thought you hated us . 
  i do n't know anyone who hates sweden irl , you swedes on the other hand do n't seem to like us . 
  at least you acknowledge our independence .
