  to be fair that was n't completely unusual for that time period so i would n't demonize russia or russians for that . 
   and they were nice to us for only like 50 years . 
  and the reason they were nice to us was because they wanted to separate us from sweden . 
  they stopped [ being nice to us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_finland ) after that . 
  you had to drink that cat piss !? 
  you must be traumatized . 
   in helsinki . . ... [ i 'm so sorry . 
  ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/1272266/landscape16_9/555/313/59d474780f99c328263403322e4d7b7/ph/989245.jpg ), 
  oh well you already know all the essential words . 
  good finland !, 
  you are pussy perkele hell !, 
  you have cat you are devil !, 
  ... thanks ? 
  thanks !, 
  you know if a russian had said that i would already be oiling my grandpapa 's mosin . 
  good thing eesti is not nordic !, 
  we already have alko which is basically the same thing . 
   but requires aircraft with higher thrust ratio engines . 
  the planes also have to carry less weapons and fuel . 
  well it would be nice to have at least somewhat competent football team and have some decent urban development policies so that our cities would n't look like siberian coal towns and it would be really nice if our country was known for something else besides alcoholism and suicides ... but perkele no way !, 
  never forget !, 
  do n't you know that sweden is on the brink of a racial civil war ? 
  that estonian looks really happy , she must have great living standards !, 
  oh and it 's nice to see that our brothers and sisters in the far-east are doing well . 
  6.7 % unemployment rate does n't sound that bad , so are things good in romania ? 
   seeing as swedish and sweden is such an enormous part of finnish culture , why would you want to remove that for a foreign country which is n't a part of that culture ? 
  our nationalists tend to be butthurt towards sweden . 
  our national identity is based on idea that we are not swedes . 
  * `` swedes we are not / no-longer , russians we do not want to become , let us therefore be finns . 
  '' * - [ fennoman motto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) . 
  the report is available [ here ] ( http://www.atomico.com/news/the-state-of-european-tech ) . 
  just make sure the rocket is not powered by ethanol . 
  you are unlikely to ever hear any swedish in finland unless you happen to live in a bilingual town . 
   mongoloid features can appear far later on a population due to conquests . 
  yakutia rightful finnish clay !, 
  but of course we have to !, 
  just imagine how horrible it would be if people had to live in cities !, 
  keeping the whole country populated is a competitive advantage even if we have to cut from education healthcare and r&d !, 
  no trump is funny , sipil\u00e4 is just depressing . 
  kainuu is the poorest region of finland and since we have to keep the whole country populated the investment was totally sensible . 
  i have heard that we finns are related to yakutians , at first i was skeptical since i had never even heard of them before but after some googling [ i changed my mind ] ( http://www.56thparallel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/slayder.jpg ) . 
  i mean that 's [ what ] ( http://www.fc-hansa.de/files/hansa-rostock/images/news/news/2009/01/6a1803e64ea62b0.jpg ) we [ finns ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/viihde/laurijuttujh2271_244_vi.jpg ) look [ like ] ( https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/3/000/083/072/3aa81fe.jpg ) , [ definitely ] ( http://www.johannalehesvuori.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/johanna.lehesvuori7619-kopio.jpg ) !, 
   gulf of finland do n't forget gulf of bothnia !, 
  i do n't know anyone who hates sweden irl . 
  i know i was being sarcastic . 
   but we both beat sweden , high five !, 
  how did we do that ? 
  edit : because of education and `` natural environment '' , sweden was far ahead of us in economy and health . 
  * seems legit !, 
  * and somehow [ sweden ] ( http://www.egynews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/files.jpg ) was ahead of us in safety and security . 
  hopefully .

  if i meet a stranger i say hello or hei or something , if i meet a close acquaintance i 'll just nod and grunt . 
  oulu can not into capital . 
  [ here is the map ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5f2ntp/a_map_of_finland_with_some_city_names_translated/ ) i posted here earlier . 
  edit : hihihi hevonperse, 
  are they trying suck my soul ? 
  so what does that actually mean ? 
  the city is named after wasa family so calling it simple vaasa in english is quite accurate . 
  while finns in general have little to no love for russia our politicians are n't nearly as `` russophobic '' as one might expect . 
  in fact many of them seem to look russia through rose-tinted glasses and behave in a finlandized manner . 
  in some cases it was easier to translate the swedish name since the meaning of the finnish name was either unclear or it did n't really mean anything . 
  though i did consider translating tampere as manchester . 
  muricans make good planes and there are n't really any alternatives to nato planes , and better nato than russia imo . 
  * go away * sounds like a nice place to visit . 
  is that with or without weapons being loaded ? 
  t-50 has internal weapon bays so it should have superior rcs to eurocanards when loaded with weapons even if the airframe itself is n't that much stealthier . 
  so who 's the kekkonen of sweden ? 
  i do n't have a link to the paper ( ca n't find it ) but if i remember correctly they came to came to the conclusion that stealth is still worth it because even if the plane is detected it does n't mean it can immediately be targeted with weapons . 
  log islet is stockholm ? 
  i have heard that the finnish name tukholma has a similar meaning . 
   i myself would also pick russian jets over euro or yank jets anytime why ? 
  western jets are usually better overall and russia is the basically the reason why we want jets in the first place . 
  i wonder if trump 's election will affect our fighter replacement program . 
   which means they have many potato ? 
  we have many [ potato ] ( https://www.proagria.fi/sites/default/files/styles/landscape_large/public/news_article/image_main/peruna_art.jpg?itok=khajyeoo ) in ostrobothnia !, 
  potatos as far [ eyes can see ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/11625/normal_20130802-_mg_0863jv.jpg ) !, 
  so is the between rivers actually between rivers ? 
  also where are the health and endurance ? 
  hmph and are you also going to claim that [ lakasoppa ] ( https://svenska.yle.fi/recept/2002/08/21/tom-laaksonens-laksoppa ) , a soup from my region kokkola , is also swedish ? 
  my brother-in-law bought one of those ( philips energylight hf3319 i believe ) it does n't emit any uv light which apparently can be an issue with poorer lights . 
  what are you telling me that you do n't love our asian bros ? 
  literally a `` fish-cock '' . 
   i usually just drink it straight from my victims neck . 
  [ heartplugs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akd2yldrvb8&amp;t=0m45s ) are far more convenient . 
  why not ? 
  it 's tasty and nutritious !, 
  looks much better than our christmas markets . 
   not sure if that 's bringing your countries closer though . 
  it 's not that bad as long as you use enough cream , and the ideal amount of cream is around 100 % . 
  ## and just what the hell is wrong with [ r\u00d6ssypottu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6ssypottu ) !, 
  10:26 i 'm sorry but who 's hungary and in what way are we trying to build a relationship with them ? 
   ive seen french cars , my father likes his renault . 
  no japan , our asian blos ale not letting us down !, 
   and poise a stronger economic power against russian oligarchs . 
  ^ it ^ also ^ helps ^ when ^ you ^ have ^ `` big ^ brother '' [ ^ ^ see ^ ^ foreign ^ ^ investments ^ ^ to ^ ^ finland ^ ^ in ^ ^ 2015 ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en_007.gif ), 
   the finns stayed neutral all these years what / u/latvianlion said and also russia is the single most important reason why we are in the eu . 
   we have a part of population that still looks at soviet union with pink glasses and feel nostalgia towards it . 
  was the infrastructure the soviets built really that good ? 
  i wonder if any of ours are on display .
