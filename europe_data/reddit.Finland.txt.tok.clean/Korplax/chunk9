  i would never have expected a pro-kremlin party in a baltic country . 
  surprised by the lithuania . 
  no i think he was serious . 
  my comment was a tongue-in-cheek jest . 
  german and iranian are also related ( or at least i think they are i 'm not a linguist so please do n't shoot me ) so are germans and iranians related ? 
  there is far more to culture than just some prehistoric linguistical connection . 
   i thought that hungary 's ancestry would align with that of finland much more , given that the two languages are related . 
  contrary what people on the internet seem to believe there is no real connection between finns and hungarians . 
   russia is considered to be east finland by finns . 
  well i suppose it depends where you are from , to me as a western coaster russia is not `` east finland '' ... to me east finland is `` west russia '' . 
  or maybe the eu is reich !, 
   their army would be all the swedes from north , they are the craziest . 
  great , i have been looking for change to have another boxing match with my cousin !, 
  i agree , patria amv would have been an excellent choice !, 
  i 'll gladly join the empire of iceland as long you teach us how to play football . 
  disagree about what ? 
  if estonians want to welcome their new overlords then good for them . 
  ahh the religion classes , i do n't remember anyone taking those classes seriously . 
  i think most students were more interested in '' [ church boats ] ( http://www.stuntman.fi/images/products/591vhm_orig.jpg ) '' than paying any attention . 
  edit :  we also were n't really taught about other religions in re ( religious education ) classes until 7th grade , and even then the classes had a clear bias for christianity . 
  also , and i do n't know how common this is elsewhere in finland , but even in upper secondary school we had a weekly morning broadcast broadcasted to every classroom in which a priest would talk about god or goodness . 
  i remember my experiences being similar except i do n't remember any christian bias after the 7th grade and in upper secondary school ( lukio ) no one ever mentioned religion . 
  sure we are , however we do n't mind joking about this with you . 
  like we would ever want to ! ^ ^ ^ ^ well ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ briefly ^ ^ ^ ^ discussed ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ 1940, 
  i have to admit that you are probably right . 
  especially with a hornet ring !, 
  [ could be worse ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.studio55.fi%2ftastapuhutaan%2farticle%2fpaavo-lipponen-mehan-olemme-ruotsalaisia%2f128856&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  i figured as much , it just looked bit amusing . 
  do they also like russia like some of our right wingers do ? 
  seriously though , are there actually norwegian parts in sweden or something ? 
  oh good to know , so we no longer need mandatory swedish then ? 
  at least we are not east sweden then . 
  actually russian took us from you before that . 
  we do n't speak the same language though . 
  are n't you swedes norwegians and danes same people ? 
  you even speak the same language !, 
  i thought you swedes were paragons of sobriety ? 
  i 'm starting to get confused . 
  you are occupying yourselves ? 
  never been to [ nedervetil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdoaa99m1vy ) eh ? 
  why not ? 
  you 'll finally get to be nordic and do n't you estonians miss * `` the good old swedish times '' * or something ? 
  that map is totally wrong !, 
  it 's `` contest '' not `` conest '' !, 
  why not ? 
  you all speak the same language and i 'm sure you would get along perfectly . 
  at least someone would be happy . 
  if only norway was a member of eu we might actually rid ourselves of mandatory swedish . 
  [ tesla already has . 
  ] ( http://www.autoblog.com/2016/11/08/tesla-buys-german-company-manufacturing/ ), 
  i think i recognize couple of words . 
  like maha which means stomach . 
  russian is not a popular language finland and it has only recently slightly increased in popularity . 
  swedish is , or at least was , actually kinda useful language so i think it would still be so somewhat popular albeit declining language . 
  english is overwhelmingly the most popular language in finland , no other language comes even close . 
  i wonder if german would be more popular than swedish in finland if swedish was n't mandatory . 
  do your legionaries know how to ski ? 
  [ indeed .

   n9 such a shame that phone was never given a change . 
  hahaha we are a year older than you !, 
  knowing our government we are just going to cut more from education and r&d and invest more in barns . 
  is n't our current growth based on construction and domestic consumption ? 
  or play clash of clans or angry birds . 
  edit : or my [ summer car ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbitex-8icm ) , finland 's next success story !, 
  we are slowly starting to waddle ahead !, 
  more or less since most of our buildings were built in the 20th century , however large wooden old towns like the ones in rauma and porvoo are rare . 
  first [ meyer ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-shipyards-iduskcn12b0mf ) and now this , maybe things are slowly getting better . 
  i hope our rate is close to sweden 's , which it probably is . 
  most of our cities are quite new so that 's to be expected . 
  the old towns in the west coast , take [ rauma for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_rauma ) , are some of the oldest we have . 
  * twelve degrees !? 
  * that 's like you were living in a sauna or something , i hope you wo n't die from dehydration . 
  dude it 's like 0 degrees over here . 
  it must be fun living in such a tropical climate with palm trees and coconuts . 
   are you having austerity measures due to the growth decline ? 
  yep our government is cutting from [ education and r&d ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/oecd_warns_finland_over_education_cuts/8415474 ) for example , although they are investing in barns . 
  according to [ more recent polls ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9268198 ) the sdp ( social democrats ) has already overtaken the centre party ( kesk ) . 
  our snow for your warmth , do we have a deal ? 
  yay finally some growth !, 
  damn it !, 
  just because we have mandatory swedish and the fact that half of foreign investments to finland come sweden does n't mean we are eastern sweden !, 
  well finland is not even a century old yet . 
  well at least we are now building new areas instead demolishing old buildings for example j\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and kalasatama and i think our architecture is also getting better . 
   urbanization was proceeding rapidly during that time and there was a huge demand for new apartments in the cities . 
  hopefully we have learned our lesson . 
  hey at least you are surrounded by the sea from one side !, 
   so usa and europe are playing a game of good cop bad cop but on a much larger scale ? 
  more like cop and meter maid . 
   we need to build a wall !, 
  and make germoney pay for that wall !, 
   what then ? 
  make yurop great again !, 
  thanks now i ca n't unsee that . 
   i do n't know why it 's not reflecting in the labour market yet , maybe it will take time . 
  it will . 
  finland also has some unique structural problems , for example some unemployed people live in regions where new jobs are n't being created . 
  it is . 
  while our unemployment rate has n't declined this year our employment rate has increased and there are more people looking for jobs .
