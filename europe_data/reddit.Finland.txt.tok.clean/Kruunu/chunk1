so can we get a tunnel from helsinki to tallinn ? 
  i mean , this is a great way to get europe more and more frustrated over our policies if we give in to the russian will . 
  i do n't think it would n't really be in our best interests to just drift away from the common european goal , whatever that might be , or if there is one . 
  [ rk62 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/rk62_disassembled.jpg ) - the older version of the fdf standard version weapon , which is pretty identical with all the other variants of ak weapons . 
  [ ak-47 ] ( http://weaponsman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ak_47_exploded_view.png ) exploded view . 
  what the rebel is using is probably an akm or ak-74 , but still , they work in the same way !, 
   using spare-parts from other weapons is easier etc. 
  and ofc you wo n't point the weapon at something you do n't mean to kill , but they are cleaning their weapons , it 's impossible to have bullets in there when doing that . 
  to check that the gun barrel is clean ? 
  i mean , that 's pretty standard procedure when cleaning a weapon . 
  uncle ? 
  i thought sweden was more like our mom and we are her daughter . 
  mother svea and the finnish maiden . 
  estonia , yes , as a brother . 
  but as / u/kalleluuja said , a little brother . 
  and russia , well , i do n't know . 
  the drunk & evil step dad sounds good . 
  well the map does n't argue with you . 
  few questions for you !, 
   your lack of experience has no bearing on the fact it is quite a common opinion . 
  do you have any better source of information then your opinion ? 
  i mean the site you linked , `` att utrota vithetsnormen -- med ord och handling '' - is not about eliminating the majority rule of ethnic white people . 
  according to the site their agenda is to take full advantage of different cultural heritages to try to better the working force of sweden . 
  or do you have other sources of information about this topic ? 
  yup , i actually trained a little with the nbg 11 , when i did my service in 2010 . 
  they seemed like nice guys and really motivated . 
  we did a 80km march together with them , and they seemed actually pretty happy about doing something together with us ( conscripts ) . 
  i was actually interested in joining the ngb 14 , but i did n't find any information about joining , or if they are even recruiting . . 
  hey !, 
  we had snus_fabriker in finland as well . 
  edit : oops . 
  turku , as usual , is a shitty place to live , even the swedish fires hate this city . 
  there 's one more version to add to the mix : [ v\u00e5rt land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-xm4syh3t4 ), 
  we also use pampas here in finland to describe the swedishspeaking region of ostrobothnia and pampes for the people living there . 
  the word comes from the same place you described , and it 's also really flat there . 
  but it 's not a really used as a foul word , at least by those damn pampeser them self . 
  yeah !, 
  just to superalko and back , in like 2hours , no need to visit the town at all anymore !, 
  well , according to this : http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2014-06-11/617906/havsytan-kan-stiga-30-centimeter you 're wrong . 
  but i do n't know , i 'm not a meteorologist . 
  thank god they canceled the k\u00e4mp tower ... 
  we do n't build metros and houses close to each other , you know , metro stations are violent places . 
  but , yeah , the areas where these stations are located are more like neighbourhood units and/or small transportation hubs . 
  there will be many busses going to the stations from the smaller neigbourdhoods [ ( iivisniemi ) ] ( http://www.hagerlund.net/sites/default/files/images/iivisniemi-kuva-04.jpg ) and they are looking to make trams that connect these metrostations with bigger neighbourhoods . 
  indeed , though the fortum tower is pretty tall , 83,6 m exactly . 
  the depressing thing here is that that 's the highest office building in finland . 
  i saw the album of copenhagen 's metro stations beeing built and became a bit jealous , so i wanted to show you guys how our new metro project looks like . 
  ( helsinki ) if your interested in the project and more pictures check out : https://www.flickr.com/photos/lansimetro the pictures from this album is also from there !, 
  lower socioeconomic status . 
  you can see this same separation or segregation if you wish , in almost everything here . 
  for exempel [ employment ] ( http://blogs.helsinki.fi/nataliae/files/2014/01/kartta1.png ) darker green = better . 
   in finland , parliament decides annually in connection with the approval of the state budget how many quota refugees finland will undertake to accept . 
  since 2001 , the number of quota refugees accepted by finland has been 750 per year . 
  and for sweden  the number of refugees that are to be offered protection in sweden is decided every year by the swedish government . 
  how many refugees can be taken , and from which countries , can vary due to circumstances in different parts of the world . 
  over the last few years the swedish refugee quota has been between 1,200 and 1,900 persons . 
  it 's mostly just politics . 
  i found this actually pretty interesting . 
  as you may know , finland is one of the most religious countries in northern europe . 
      33 % of finnish citizens `` believe there is a god '' . 
  ( in 2005 , the figure was 41 % )  42 % `` believe there is some sort of spirit or life force '' . 
  ( in 2005 , the figure was 41 % )  22 % `` do not believe there is any sort of spirit , god , or life force '' . 
  ( in 2005 , the figure was 16 % ) on top of this we have in our parliament the christan democrats who has 6 seats out of 200 and 13,000 members in 2011 . 
  their lead [ p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4ivi_r%c3%a4s%c3%a4nen ) is a pretty outspoken `` extreme '' christian who is against abortion , gay-marriage and so on . 
  then we have the [ conservative laestadians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_laestadianism ) who are pretty religious . 
  and have these huge gatherings where tens of thousands of people go every year . 
  http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article5440592.ece/alternates/w580/suviseurat but still , nothing as extreme as in the usa . 
  everywhere outside citys . 
  though sweden has more equipment ( boats etc. 
  ) , finns have more men power to use ( at least now when we conscript ) . 
  why not make some kind of deal to let finns use the equipment and train with your equipment . 
  that would probably help sweden if russia decide to attack the nordics . 
  i think the logic behind joining russia would be something like / u/lowprof1le said jokingly . ^ ^ ^ atleast ^ ^ ihopehe ^ was ^ joking anyways , crazy reasons , crazy people . 
  but those nationalist also dislike the swedish speaking minority , so i believe a reason might be that they prefer russia more and would gladly see the swedish speaking minority emigrating , without understanding the consequences of such actions . 
  but then you will get annexed buy russia when they come and `` free '' your russian minority from the evil oppressing finns who annexed you first . 
  no expert on russian mentality or never even really thought about it , but i think / u/rkoloeg means that russians identify themselves as russians / slavic people . 
  there has been such a long tradition of war against the east , so , i think that 's why russians do n't identify themselves as europeans . 
  you should move to mariehamn -3 there right now . 
  and 150km away on the mainland -15 . 
  thanks . 
  i doubt the guy who was chosen as king lives anymore . 
  `` he [ ( prince frederick charles of hesse ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_charles,_landgrave_of_hesse ) was elected king of finland on 9 october 1918 , but renounced the throne on 14 december 1918 . '', 
    - to compare our students ' results with those in shanghai or japan is insane . 
  both the culture and perception of school work is very different . 
  our yardstick must be the nordic countries and europe , says johansson . 
  something about the fall of the finnish education in pisa , i guess she 's not entirely wrong . 
  but i would n't want to our standards of education to be compared with swedes and your education . 
  i 'm sorry , you need to fix your shit together . 
  but so do we , there 's a constant trend that 's making our schools more and more , well , a bit more like the schools in sweden . 
  hey !, 
  here in finland actually . 
  you guys have it written like that ? 
  from page , 89 -  there 's some information about the word , that it may come from the word `` otsa '' and would mean something like `` leve\u00e4 otsainen '' . 
  edit : and for those who do n't understand finnish , otsa is forehead , and leve\u00e4 otsainen means `` someone with a broad forehead '', 
  otso is another word for bear in finnish , though , not actually that much used as a word for bears but as a name for men . 
  might have something to do with the latin word ? 
  nope . 
  there 's atleast primorsk and st.petersburg , both commercial ports . 
  something something russians , something something too soon ? 
  gdansk to turku flight will still be cheaper , faster and more enjoyable .
