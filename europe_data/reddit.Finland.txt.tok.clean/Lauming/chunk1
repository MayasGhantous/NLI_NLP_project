the stats for ukraine , norway , russia and iceland basically come from news articles , most of which do n't have a link to an original study the article is based on . 
  on top of that , the timespan for this map is erratic - some of your `` stats '' were taken after terror attacks or the annexation of crimea . . to some , like me , this makes your post ( s ) seem like they focus on 1 . making finland number 1 and 2 . 
  making everything in cis or central europe pale in comparison . 
  the eu-made barometer is good and i consider it trustworthy as long as its up to date , but come on . 
  either have a better source than an article from some random local newspaper , or do n't include the stat at all . 
  this is n't an attack on the poster , just a really justified criticism that on one side some countries have a really good source ( eurobarometer ) and then the others have some random articles . 
  ( i read through them all , they 're super short and i never recognise the newspaper ) i 'm finnish and i trust the police , but i really do n't feel different in poland or slovakia , and the 14 % for russia just seems weird . 
  30-40 % maybe , but not sub-20 % if turkey & finland are that high . 
  ( idk about the eurobarometer , but it looks like istanbul was the only place surveyed in turkey , even before this year 's events ), 
  you 're saying it as if a propaganda channel and biased reporting are mutually exclusive . 
  also , in comparison to rt , cctv , etc. 
  ca n't `` western media '' also be seen , in a multitude of ways , as propaganda channels ? 
  especially since a sizeable portion of the readers think themselves `` media-critical '' which leads them to boycott bbc or national news channels and favour radical right-wing media because those are * definitely not * propaganda channels . 
  just wanted to add a meme to my post : `` propaganda in 2k16 lul '' because we 're acting , sort of pretentiously , that propaganda is a problem in * non-western * countries and not present in our societies ( and who believes that , now ? ) . 
  propaganda is a type of text which is n't some sort of new invention . 
   every german i meet seems to consider a masters very important not just germans . . sure , the higher education system in the nordics is strongly based on the humboldtian model , though even so i really wonder how americans & canadians find a use for a simple bachelor 's degree . 
  to me , a bachelor 's degree does n't even really exist . 
  nobody goes to uni in order to get a bachelor 's degree here . . 
  it 's considered worthless / barely worth mentioning in most circumstances . 
  the phd . 
  thing is a bit different , but i 'm really in need of a tl ; dr as to how u.s. & canada find people with bachelor 's degrees viable in the job market . 
  note : and when it comes to the u.s. , it 's even more unfathomable . 
  when here it 's plain impossible to become a teacher without a master 's degree , `` teach for america ! '', 
  programmes take kids who barely went to high school and make them teachers . . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i think tencent may just trademark the word gaming altogether now . . 
  they 're like the drug dealers of gaming , owning all the addictive online games . . oh and a cash cow chatting app literally everyone in china uses , wechat, 
  so you 're saying all groups which are ( often falsely ) implicated of being responsible for the actions of the few are expected to drop everything and go to politics or ask to be featured on bbc so they wo n't be outcast ? 
  those who played the original doom must all express solidarity for playing the same game as the columbine shooters ? 
  everyone who vote for nationalist/republican parties in northern ireland must all appear on national television to say sorry because some idiots blew shit up , that was our fault ? 
  something makes me think they do n't want to do that and that * it 's okay * hope this post does something in the way of explaining where i 'm coming from . 
  p. s. sorry for typos ; typed with thumbs . 
  well . . 1 . 
  ** wahhabism ** , aka fundamentalism is n't considered a school , rather an alternative . 
  muslims that are * not * fundamentalists ( overwhelming majority ) are often referred to as traditionalists . 
  fundamentalism is correlative , though not causative , to radicalisation . 
  ** most importantly ** , schools are n't really that centric . 
  there has never been actual conflicts between major schools unlike with shiite and sunni . 
  the schools are nowhere near as different as , for example , in buddhism . 
  just in case your question was serious , those are 4 of the 5 main schools of sunni islam , and the ones which still have a following today . 
  shias also have 2 major schools . 
  short answer : none of 'em . 
  read up on salafis / wahhabism if you 're looking for fundamentalists . 
  it does n't support any school of fiqh , and is a bit more common in saudi arabia . 
  that being said , it still does n't mean crazy , but most extremists are considered fundamentalists ( though nto all fundamentalists are extremists ) so \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i think you 're overestimating the role of madhabs in both sunni and shia islam . 
  you 're right that none of the 5 +2 schools of fiqh recognise ahmadiya , but ahmadiya is n't really the hottest topic of discussion in most muslim countries . . nobody has emergency family meetings to make sure nobody in the house ` ave gon ' and joined dem ahmadiyas . 
  similarly i doubt ahmadiyas themselves embrace the practices of jafari shias or something . . but this is just how religious sects work , so this should n't be that big of a deal really . 
  culturally and for the most part in terms of religious theory , ahmadiya is n't * that * different . 
  true , it 's doubtful you 'd see sunnis or shias doing the same thing as the guys in the article . 
  does n't mean that ahmadiyas are somehow `` more against '' isis than other groups . . heck , you 'd think the ones actually being terrorised and attacked by isis in , well , the i & s parts of the abbreviation , would at least be equally pissed off with what extremists are doing . 
  sorry if i did n't explain my point well enough . 
  i meant that nobody should * need * to denounce shit . . millions ( and in this case , billions ) of people should n't be politicised like that . 
  but yeah . . on the other hand , when the media has politicised extremists and practically given them their own news channel to spread their propaganda . . the least they could do is report on the other 99 % , , sorta like this post #occupyfoxnews, 
  it 's nice , but this should n't be * expected * of them . 
  i 've seen comments like `` with these events , i fully expect all [ insert name of large ethnic or religious group ] s to fully condemn these events and speak out against these barbaric acts '' . 
  it 's not an offensive statement , and usually the person saying this is quite rational and moderate . . but . . 
  i mean from the perspective of completely normal people going about their everyday lives ( the people politics , etc. 
  is supposed to serve , regardless of religious denomination ) they wan na do the same thing : read the news , gasp at how things are going downhill in the world wether its economics , terrorism in pakistan or france , politics in turkey , etc. 
  and then move on with their lives , maybe have a 5min conversation about it at work , because they want to leave this situation to the professionals * or * the guys at politics ( these 2 are mutually exclusive ) . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  even with the history of the balkans ( e.g. 
  yugoslavia ) , all modern-day balkan countries still retain a strong sense of national identity , so it 's not really likely that they go `` notice me senpai '' on other non-balkan countries . 
  yup . 
  of course they are a bit different from russia 's sanctions on most eu countries , and talks attempts have been made to lift them between the 2 countries . 
   sanctions on russia and even more importantly , sanctions ** by ** russia . 
  scrutinising polls and opinion surveys , whatever the alterior motive may be , is always good in my book . 
  it 's a rare treat . 
  you know the thing they 're doing here , right ? 
  it 's called social services / child protection . 
  a teenager planning on committing mass murder by schooting up a school and another teenager is planning on committing mass murder by joining isis . . should the approach to these two be drastically different ? 
  whether or not isis is a bigger headline than school shootings is irrelevant . 
  not saying i 'd give either one hugs and kisses but the most important thing in social welfare & social services is * consistency *, 
  tell me truthfully , did the original study in srpski say `` russian society '' specifically ? 
  and how often is the word `` russian '' and `` slavic '' treated as synonymous ? 
  i think emphasizing the word `` russian '' might give the non-serbs in this sub the wrong idea . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but we can also understand `` russian '' as something which is 1 . 
  an alternative to western individualism and anti-eastern european sentiment and 2 . 
  traditional , slavic values and culture . . and not just the country and `` putin '' as westerners see it . 
  obviously not something mentioned in a serbian survey . . but in serbia 's post-ottoman history they themselves were one of their biggest enemies . 
  the definitions of `` a serb '' , `` a croat '' and `` a bosniak '' were and still are so damn loose and unspecific that serbs fighting serbs was mostly what their wars in the 20th century were about . 
  religion is n't a common denominator either . 
  good ol' wu-tang financial . 
  the meme lives !, 
  i disagreed with the whole `` great people '' and democracy part . 
  capitalism does n't need either of those to work . 
  i had no problem with the `` making good decisions '' thing , n'est pas ? 
  i mean switzerland is ok but nobody should look at lx or la suisse for lpts or something . 
  you should look at the scandinavia , poland , namibia , vietnam , south korea and stuff for actual `` success stories '' . 
  i mean the small country thing , at least in europe , is a decent point . 
  but if we want to be completely honest , being a `` great people '' or democratic has n't got much to do with getting rich . 
  not all countries are individual heroes that accrue billions just by themselves while they hate and shun their neighbours . 
  these countries have been wealthy commercial hubs for a long time . . back when not all countries were lead by narcissistic idiots who wanted nothing to do with people outside their cute little borders . 
  many would , at least historically consider the two countries as inseparable from germany and france in many ways . 
  you can find municipalities in germany and france which resemble them a lot . 
  ( at least lux . . 
  which is to some mini-belgium ) statistics just do n't show that . 
  do n't rely on statistics , 
  greetings from russia !, 
  no but really .
