  you can make putin jokes and slavic puns and stuff and most people will laugh with you . . mayo and all things pertaining to it is sacred , though . 
  tfw asking for sources or links is a breach of galactic code . 
  might be related to saying stupid ass stuff like spanking not being beating earlier on , but still ... smh . 
  was n't it about poland in particular ? 
  you might be surprised , but most people educated on the topic would , more than anything , disagree with your ideas about `` our culture '' . 
  how `` our culture '' is about arbitrarily defined `` equality between women and men '' ( lots of evidence to disprove that ) , lgbt rights ( baby steps have been taken . . and even those in but a handful of eu countries ) and being secular ( because most just keep lying to themselves that christianity or other religions are somehow absent or abandoned . . would love to write more about this one ) . . not trying to start anything and i know i 'm in the minority ( * in this thread , on this webpage * , which i completely am fine with ) with my politics , but just wanted to point out that we seem to too easily * assume * our advancement in some social areas over others with really nothing to go on when you think about it . 
  umm . . what ? 
  what does the ukraine being ( arguably ) in `` europe '' have to do with that ? 
  last time i checked it matters fuck all where you 're from - if you move from one nation-state to another you are migrating and as such an immigrant in the target country . 
  it 'd actually be hella cool if this happened imo . 
  already a year into learning chinese . 
  here we come cold war 2.0 or whatever !, 
  problem is that the natural consequence of knowing your shit tends to be the deeper understanding of not knowing shit at all . 
  when politicians and normal people can easily go `` let 's cut healthcare , close the borders and invest in fossil fuels '' , educated people ca n't ( usually ) bring themselves to think in such absolutes / black & white . 
  the most practical person on earth is basically some farmer guy with a pitchfork that does n't know right from wrong . . nor does he know how an economy , government - or anything really - works . 
  oh and just as a side note . . `` professors '' are n't really a group of people . 
  they can be categorised by the fact they are highly educated . . and i think we are n't at the point where we start saying education is dumb and that everybody should just go to the labour lottery . 
  not yet . 
  yeah well in switzerland , at least outside zurich , i 'd wager that works partly because of the population & provincial structure . 
  there 're * some * examples of countries with bigger population counts & more provinces that do n't really do the whole referendum thing too well . 
  * cough * still wonder why you 're seemingly against professors . 
  what did they ever do to you ? 
  last i checked switzerland is just a couple of blocks off from where me and my country are staying . . it 's not on another planet even though some people make it out to be like that . 
   it clearly works much better when you let professors and politicians decide everything . 
  / s what a world we live in when politicians ; usually directly elected by the people , and professors ; people whose job is to know their shit and make educated assessments , should not be given a say . 
  purge the intelligentsia !, 
  they know nothing !, 
  thanks for the insight . 
  then again for some reason i have never heard anyone be called `` arab american '' . 
  but i do n't really understand the ethnic definitions used in the u.s. anyway . . 
  so not going to claim i 'm an expert . 
  i like how most of us do it in europe , even though there 's room for improvement . 
  ( e.g. 
  italian = italian , 2nd gen italian immigrant in germany = italian-german or german with italian background ) in a perfect world `` immigrant background '' would n't matter as much , e.g. 
  if a 3rd gen person has italian ancestry , him robbing a liquor store is still a german problem , not an italian one . 
  ( italy and germany used as examples . 
  italians do n't rob liquor stores . 
  just an example . ), 
  we need a u.s. flair to explain to us exactly why `` jewish american '' and `` muslim american '' are a thing when their counterparts are e.g. 
  `` hispanic '' , `` african american '' , `` italian american '' and `` asian american '' . 
  i mean the jewish american thing i can understand as the word `` jewish '' is [ possibly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/who_is_a_jew%3f ) the most complicated demonym ever . 
  hard to explain why , but there 's a longstanding tradition within european/christian/western culture to perceive the * other * abrahamic religions , mainly islam and judaism , as somehow `` absolute '' and `` timeless '' . 
  whereas europeans are * enlightened * , muslims and jews are `` set in their ways '' , representing the `` old '' to europe 's `` new '' . 
  the stereotype is frankly annoying . 
  let 's say we have an indonesian , algerian and turkmen person . 
  they 're soo not different in any way `` because it 's all the same islam , innit ? '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s but the `` timelessness '' issue is just a part of the problem . 
  taking into count europe 's past with anti-semitism , the 4th figure is disheartening . 
  czechoslovakia , austria and ukraine were , according to many , `` culturally '' more anti-semitic than germany pre-ww2 . 
  i 'm willing to argue that even the cultural distance between morocco and spain is pretty inconsequential , at least from the perspective of the right people . 
  everything from food , architecture , history , etc. 
  you should know , though , that `` integration '' is a whole different topic . 
  first , being culturally integrated does n't mean you contribute more economically . 
  second , integration and the `` success '' thereof can depend on the host country and its policies just as much as the migrant/one who is expected to `` integrate into '' something . 
  ( the semantics of `` integration '' are being distorted a lot , eh ? ), 
  often when we talk of `` cultural difference '' we are blind to the influence of institutions and social policies that * differentiate * . 
  so when you might think moroccans are inherently different from spaniards , it could just as well be spanish law making it a lot easier for the venezuelans . 
  i 'm open to considering law , policies , etc. 
  as `` culture '' , but most people are n't . 
  ( apart from maybe the `` western culture '' claim ), 
  most if not everyone with the wherewithal to migrate are educated . 
  it 's all relative to the host country whether it is worth a damn though . 
  and shared culture does n't really mean much in most circumstances , does it ? 
  i mean move far enough from the iberian peninsula and you 'll see people group spain , portugal , morocco , etc. 
  together with ease . 
  i mean obviously with political motive one will emphasise your ( sea ) border with morocco and land border to france ad nauseum . 
  does n't mean that those differences amount to anything concrete . 
  without social policy actively reinforcing those stereotypes . 
  alright . 
  so let 's drop the word scientific for a moment . 
  if i wrote for a sociological journal about discrimination and racism in the public sphere in * any european country * ( it 's not a case of `` these guys have x problem but we would never . . '' ) , would i be wrong in * acknowledging * that without e.g. 
  hungary 's internment policy my paper would probably be very different ? 
  at the same time it 's not really taboo for a sociologist to be politically active in antiracist or feminist circles ( underpaid tree hugger according to some ) , if they want to . 
  i know entirely what you are getting at , but even papers in computer science or toxicology are supposed to criticise and evaluate political decision-making . 
  obviously in this example it 's a short jab in the acknowledgements that does n't directly relate to their field which is unfortunate , but then again you ca n't fault it for not making the headlines . 
  ( i 've seen this in facebook a few times now ), 
  thanks for the reply . 
  actually , i would very much like to hear what a french person thought about the way finnish history is represented and celebrated , and give his own opinion on whether this is justifying violence and decadence or celebrating finland 's or humanity 's accomplishments and ingenuity . 
  this is n't about my flair and your flair engaging in fisticuffs , i probably `` triggered '' just as many finns as i did french people in questioning the reason why certain historical events that pertained to them are glorified . 
  the non-dutch who criticise ( d ) black pete were a huge target of hostility and jokes alike as they were seen by many as `` grasping at straws '' , etc. 
  on the other hand , we should n't think that every person of a certain nationality feels the same about every historical event in their country . 
  french people who could care less about the revolution , serbs who do n't identify as such , americans who do n't care about lincoln , t. roosevelt or * insert great battle lost by redcoats * . 
  thanks for the reply .

  the non-dutch who criticise ( d ) black pete were also a target of claims such as `` what would you know '' and `` this does n't concern you '', 
  i mean you raised some good points about how to approach history as a subject but you 're wrong if you think this is about whether history is important or not . 
  how 'd you get that idea ? 
  the historical events i listed were not supposed to illustrate history in general , but historical events that are ambiguous in terms of it being a be great and positive event for both [ country ] and humanity . 
  i really hope you were active in the threads about srebrenica , the armenian genocide and the holocaust . 
  they are historical events which are not celebrated - even if some student groups treat a class trip to auschwitz ii as a vacation - but commemorated nonetheless . 
  on top of that , there are many people who wish to deny these events ever happened , which is either because of shame or , more commonly , because they want to erase the history and placate the behaviour knowledge of said history would encourage . 
  in regards to the french revolution , well , rarely are words such as `` tyranny '' or `` mass murder '' , used in conjunction with it . 
  and that is what interests me : how is violent murder justified in history when it 's condemned in present day . 
  it 's still violent murder , though in this case it 's men killing their countrymen which , in today 's world , is much easier justified for many a reason ( not a good thing , that ) . 
  and while i recognise the meta that you wish us to engage in a bait game , i wanted to point out that you should n't be focusing on nazi finland , but rather the representations of civil war in this year 's independence celebrations ( e.g. 
  the glorifying of the execution of leftist prisoners in official jubilee coins and insignia and exaggerations about war history ) . 
  it 's another example of how violence is glorified and celebrated in history , but i doubt going off now and decapitating members of the socialist party would be met so with such enthusiasm ( though there have been attempts to justify even this ) . 
   wow , if true that 's just sad . 
  not everybody in the world is french .
