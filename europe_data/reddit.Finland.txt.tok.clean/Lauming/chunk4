  this is only if we 're being [ serious ] , though . 
  treating all migrants as a demographic that is void of socioeconomics , education or goals is a popular way of thinking nowadays it seems , but imo it 's not a problem-solving attitude , more of a broken record . 
  you 'd be surprised how many of the general public in `` our glorious western democracies '' would be ready to say `` screw the others '' as long as it behoofs them . 
  corruption , etc. 
  nationality is just one way to categorise people . 
  obviously , but you still do n't call it by that . 
  `` south african apartheid 's lord of the rings '' , `` tolstoi 's wife 's anna karenina '' , `` battle royale 's hunger games '' . . what ? 
  the work is * by * the author , and as such it is * the author 's * work . 
  not something that really needs to be debated . 
  obviously witcher 3 contains huge amounts of references to old polish mythology and , come on , sapkowski * is * polish . 
  still , attributing the witcher books to * anything * but the author ( or the games to any other institution than cdpr * and * sapkowski ) betrays the fact you do n't care about the series , rather you 're using it as a political tool . 
  btw , i used the * you * passive in english . 
  not accusing anybody of anything but i was wondering why op did n't say `` andrzej sapkowski 's the witcher saga '' . 
  i do n't know why u/yasenfire wrote that but guessing it 's a troll making a stupid joke , but i just want to say that idris elba is a damn good actor ( probably one of the most popular ones around atm ) . 
  discuss whitewashing/diversifying/correctness etc all you want , but choosing a good actor to ` prove your point ' is sorta scummy . 
  do n't want to nitpick , but works of art and literature are not `` poland 's '' or any country 's , they belong to the author/creator . 
  seeing as this is r/europe the wording is completely understandable ( like eurovision stuff ) , though . 
  aw shit i knew i forgot about something !, 
  depending on who you ask ( like with all the listed countries ) iran is home to * many * more inventions and developments than just shishkabab . . do n't get me wrong though , the shishkabab * is * one of the most important inventions on earth , at least in my book !, 
  za warudo would be a better place if less people jumped and shouted `` ey , you !, 
  you have no right to be critical of anything ! '' . . 
  giving some weird-ass reasons like `` you 're not one of us '' ( e.g. 
  immigrants , no matter from where , should rather be `` grateful '' than `` critical '' . . so completely brainwashed ) or `` you 're worse '' . . as if that is an excuse to hide your own problems . 
  i agree , though , that just saying `` vote better '' is a bit off -  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nvzf1_f0pw ), 
  if tory pms have been bad at anything lately , it is trying to convince people about one option being better than another . 
  the whole brexit thing has basically been a story about the tories getting people to vote for them but falling flat on every other aspect of being a political party . 
  this i feel is the case at least in england & wales because . . come on , nobody else is really putting on much of a fight . . 
  i mean i 've only heard that d\u00f6ner is the og and that shawarma ( arabic ) and gyros ( greek ) are derivative , though very different , from it . 
  i mean i know this a shitpost and it 's not meant for [ serious ] stuff , but i doubt we 'll ever know the `` truth '' , just got ta live with it . 
  then again , this is greece-macedonia-bulgaria-turkey-lebanon-iraq-cyprus we are talking about . . where `` we invented it and the others stole it '' can be applied to pretty much everything . . and in the end the countries and cultures are incredibly similar to each other ( i guess that 's why people disagree a lot !, 
  greece and cyprus definitely deserve to be boo 'd at . 
  historically the most egregious example , i mean even some of the greek and cypriot announcers have found it stupid of late . 
  also wondering what you mean by shared history . 
  in what way does n't every fucking country in the esc have hundreds of years of history with their neighbours ? 
  yep !, 
  both the countries and the songs !, 
  i do n't know if i was just out of the loop but i was expecting greece and denmark ( as sal said , fast food music ) to beat out most good and unique songs . 
  had hoped azerbaijan would make top 10 too , even if they had svenskj\u00e4vlar compose it again . 
  it was my kind of fast food . 
  eeh , you 're right that it harms the competitiveness , but then there 're a lot of people like me ( maybe it 's a 50/50 thing ) that follow the whole show and really like the fact we have 5 countries in the final whose ` show ' we have n't seen before . 
  i was pleasantly surprised by the uk this year and france last year . 
  i do n't really follow any preview shows so they 're completely new songs to me , a fact which i enjoy . 
  can i just take a moment to say that esc previews suck , at least in my country . 
  for us , it 's a room with 5 noname ` celebrities ' that make fun of fucking everything . 
  whether it 's the country , the make-up of the singer or something else . . 
  i love graham norton but even he has these annoying brainfarts sometimes . 
  worst thing is when everybody 's talking about russia/ukraine , as if they 're some sort of experts in that . . russian eurovision entries are really good . 
  they probably spend most $ $ $ / rubley on their entries on average with ukraine , bulgaria ( of late ) and sweden not close behind i 'd wager . 
  and sometimes it 's not even the audience but the hosts & commentators mongering idiocy . 
   this is the west . 
  we can afford to make fun of our leaders . 
  really do n't understand your comment * at all * . . not only because you seem to be blissfully unaware of that not being something for granted nowadays . . 
  but wht do you mean with `` afford '' ? 
  i mean i follow nigerian , moroccan and philippinean politics / used to ( do n't ask me why ) and dude , shitting on your president/king/poobah etc is just as common if not more so . . even in countries that europeans might not perceive as `` democratic '' or `` rich '' as they perceive themselves . 
  baila el chiki chiki died for this . . 
  i mean i want to disagree with you because wikipedia is a malignant tumor in the academic world , especially for newbie students , but i ca n't . . because you 're right . 
  i mean if erdo\u011fan thinks he can do better , i 'd see no problem . 
  then again , his `` better '' might mean something very different . . 
  apart from portugal-bulgaria - ( maybe ) sweden , there was no clear `` top 7 '' , far from it . 
  ( come on , who bets on romania or moldova ? 
  even with esx . . ) i think neither country voted like that -- and to be honest i was more afraid of portugal giving 12 to spain than bulgaria doing anything shaming-worthy . 
  jamala 's such an awesome performer that i was seriously waiting on her to * tap that ass * . 
  or , bump him off the stage . 
  then again , injuries and possible ass-to-face collisions in the audience , so maybe not . . . . she probably handled it the best way possible , now that i think about it !, 
  the criticism is far from `` absurd '' . 
  you have to have some standards when it comes to a foreign ministry 's correspondence . 
  i mean this letter is okay , especially for people who have experience with people who speak/write english as a second language , but it looks a lot like somebody just dictated polish english . 
  `` manipulation '' , omission of the definite , `` mental shortcut '' , etc. , as well as the overall feel of the language ( sort of a rant ) would support that argument . 
  and yeah . . 
  i wo n't even start on the actual statements the letter ( is trying ) to make . . am i overly critical ? 
  maybe , but then again an already questionable statement combined with grammatical mistakes does not give off a good impression imo . 
  yeah you could interpret the laws like that . 
  and i agree with your point - religion is far from ` fragile ' . 
  and if we look at the world today we can say that religion 's status is anything but `` in need of protection '' . . so to be honest we should n't need laws supporting it . 
  if and when modern religions are replaced by other religions and they only exist in small communities , maybe some positive discrimination is prudent ( e.g. 
  to prevent stuff like what happened to buddhists and daoists during the cultural revolution ) . . 
  but then again when it comes to abrahamic religions , hinduism and theravada buddhism , it 'll be a damn long time before that happens . 
  this is a bit weird . . 
  i mean outside of what it 's actually trying to say ( i do n't know ) , it does remind us that shit changes constantly . 
  the u.s. , eu , uk , african union , arab league , asean , russian federation , prc , etc. 
  wo n't exist forever . . some definitely wo n't make it to the next century in their current form . 
  gon na be interesting !, 
  then again this pic itself . . 
  i mean i know confederates = bad news , i know alabama state and nyc are in the u.s. . 
  i know article 42 could technically be called `` eu army '' . . but still , does n't make much sense . 
  tr\u00e8s incredible !, 
  the problem i have is that you 've done nothing to expand your view on `` good leadership '' apart from `` strength , posturing , stoicism '' . 
  i 'd rather a book `` worm '' than someone who spends most of his time making sure he is assertive in appearance . 
  i mean i can agree that a `` leader '' ( let 's rather use `` president '' or `` pm '' or something , shall we ? ), 
  should be well-spoken and be able to address people confidently . 
  that does n't mean aggressiveness or `` strong posturing '' . 
  and one of the most important points is that * not all politicians are president * . 
  to be quite fucking honest , i 'd rather have 1 hyperactive and talkative ` leader ' and 99 book `` worms '' alongside them , rather than 100 middle-aged guys who spend more time practising their body language and vocal range than planning economic reforms or getting familiar with academic research . 
  do you disagree ? 
  i do n't quite understand what you mean . 
  you do realise that all abrahamic religions are monotheistic and that the english word `` god '' can apply to all of them . 
  and to be honest if everybody considered blasphemy laws to be bad then we would n't have such outdated laws anyway . 
  they have a huge amount of support - unfortunately . 
  i mean i personally am in favour of a really , really lax law like in my country where it is literally `` harmony of faith '' . 
  the type of `` blasphemy '' this law would ever be applied to is the type which could also be considered hate speech or disturbance of peace ( e.g.
