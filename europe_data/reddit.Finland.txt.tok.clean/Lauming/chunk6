  if they call themselves romanian or romanian-xyzian , then that 's that . 
  them being a target of racism or not wanting to move ( back ? ), 
  to romania does n't justify anyone , wherever they 're born , to presume their ethnicity . 
  applies to russia , china , turkey , india and pakistan in equal measure . 
  i mean sort of keeps you humble if the same shit happens to you once in a while imo . 
  i find your comment even worse - irrelevant . 
  my point was that whenever someone ( like you ) talks about the western world nowadays it 's increasingly unclear what their point is overall . 
  geography , economics and political systems have not been accurate characteristics for a long time now . 
  you surprised me with how many times you were able to squeeze the word `` west '' or `` western '' into your short comment . 
  `` touches the lawmaker with his knife '' `` cold war era red scare '' it 's almost as if he is some innocent grandpa who 's just afraid and wanted to `` touch him a little '' . 
  can i have permission to use similar euphemisms if a young man ( because old  young morally i guess ) stabs one of our `` far-righteous '' politicians ? 
  greece , bulgaria , turkey , lebanon ... y' all need to get your shit together . 
  everyone knows you 've just been blatantly copying each other for millenia , and most outsiders have zero problems with that . 
  yoghurt , baklava , moussaka , kebap , democracy , modernisation , science , philosophy , language , etc. 
  the greeks , like the turks , lebanese and syriacs , are no strangers to trying to `` own '' everything they can think of . 
  * cough * your flair * cough *, 
  uhh but they did . 
  the sign does n't read `` i 'm in star wars and darth vader is my father '' , it says `` i am my father '' . 
  iirc darth luke was n't really a thing , unlike jean-marine le pen . 
  i got ta budge in and say that you should * really * reconsider what you want to call yourself . 
  you 'd be doing yourself a service if you said you 're a nationalist/patriot/whatever instead tbh . 
  also , the word `` western '' is starting to lose meaning . 
  and that is a * really good * thing , because the word has had no significant meaning in most places for a long time now . 
  similar to democracy , it 's a filler word that brings nothing to the discussion ( just in general , not really related to the rest of your comment ) . 
  yeah you 're right - i should 've clarified what i meant by hunting . 
  that is , * which * animals to hunt and what kind of quotas are set . 
  i 'd say there are many examples in the eu and na where these quotas are unbalanced or they do n't even exist . 
  ( e.g. 
  bears , wolves , crocs and gators ) but yeah i agree hunting is a completely different topic . 
  equally political but still a very different discussion . 
  yeah , of course not - did n't mean that . 
  things like slaughterhouses , hunting , bullfighting , halal/kosher , whaling , all these things get political real quick . 
  especially since le pen is involved you pretty much instantly know what she 's playing at . 
  front national is n't really hard to read in its actions . 
  i was under the impression that stunning and other common slaughterhouse practices might actually inflict much more pain on the animal than kosher or halal methods . 
  of course it depends what you 're comparing to . . like animal grinders or some crazy shit like that . 
  and to be honest does n't spain have * a lot of shit * it should be banning on that front ? 
  if they do ban halal/kosher i 'd like to introduce to them a good word < hypocrisy  that is meant for people who , for example , ban kosher while they allow even worse animal rights violations `` because it 's a different thing / our culture '' . 
  i can think of something . . or * someone * that is disgracing this `` realm of honesty and justice '' . 
  maybe it 's a sad truth you just need to accept that for many countries and people in the world , russia and russians are not the antichrist . 
  no matter how hard you 're trying to force that idea . 
  i mean i consider my lucky in the sense that i know enough estonians ( and a few latvians ) to know your extremist opinions * are not those of the majority . 
  * by those i mean the way you talk about * russians * as a people . 
  you can talk about putin and the soviet union and make any connections to whatever historical imperialist or dictator you want , but you 're crossing a lot of lines in this comment chain . 
  of course i do n't know how it is in lietuva , but populist voters over here are rural natives who think having a structured government who considers everybody 's rights equally is too `` undemocratic '' . 
  reminiscing about the soviet union ( old far left ) and voting for populists ( far right ) sort of cancel each other out , at least that 's how i 'd see it . 
  edit : and yeah i 'm pretty sure most people ( at least those with sense ) in the baltics see the current situation objectively better than the old one as members of the eu . 
  gives them reason to be really critical of the soviet union but unfortunately that also often translates to contempt for the russians ( a part of whom were pretty much the only beneficiaries of the soviet union and its dissolution ) . 
  this only supports my point of putin using average people as political cannon fodder . 
  i mean if i was randomly given an american or russian passport i 'd take it - does n't mean `` i 'm with trump '' or anything . 
  also , your source does n't really mention if the fsb took `` no '' for an answer . 
  yeah i agree . 
  and yes , these `` zombies '' do exist . . 
  they might not be ruining the country though , because they tend to exist in the fringes of society . 
  and by fringes i do n't necessarily mean the stereotypical village in no man 's land , but for example the elderly . 
  it 's almost weird how young people have a much more negative view of the soviet union than old people in former soviet countries ( as well as over here ) , when it was the elderly people who actually lived during the `` hardcore '' soviet times . 
  might just be the effect of education , really . 
  and not just the quantity of education , but also the type of education today . 
  it 's more international and while of course the balts had a * really * hard time in the u.s.s.r. , we can even include the examples of people who also * really , really * had a tough time , e.g. 
  minorities in russia , intelligentsia everywhere in the union , ukrainian men drafted , etc. 
  it 's really hard to reply to your comment . . so what you 're saying is that nazi germany = soviet union , and that you have a waterproof method of distinguishing the `` good '' from the `` bad '' by talking to them about nazi germany and the soviet union . . 
  i mean it 's no secret that modern russia ended up with the biggest share of the cake after the dissolution of the soviet union in many ways , not just in terms of land area . 
  still , saying people worship stalin is a bit funny . . 
  i mean i 'm starting to think that the siberian villages are n't the only ones who still think they live in the soviet union . . modern russia and its government is fucked up but nobody thinks russia = soviet union . 
  and i mean it 's about how we write history . 
  outside of the baltics and maybe central asia , the soviet union was * in no way * depicted in the same light as nazi germany . 
  as such it 's a lot easier for people , especially those who benefited most from the soviet union , to talk about the good things about it . 
  i mean in finnish history books gorbatchev is actually depicted in a pretty good light . 
  til being critical and considering that even western ethnic groups can be a target of discrimination = brainwashed by russian propaganda . 
  and to be honest how do you yourself recognise a russian person in estonia ? 
  appearance ? 
  hell no , we look the same . 
  food ? 
  pizza , kebab and burritos , not a real big difference . 
  religion ? 
  not really a waterproof method . 
  language ? 
  and this whole `` they carry a lot of politics with them '' sounds so weird . 
  yeah , putin will try to mess with your government because of them but a smart person would rather say `` fuck putin ! '', 
  rather than `` hey , look at these people over there , bring on the pitchforks ! '' . 
  as is the reddit way , i googled and will link the first result google offers to support my citizenship claim . 
  i know many finns and estonians who liked the `` soviet days '' , because you could easily go on holiday to the soviet union and buy the latest fashion / electronics / etc. 
  and that is n't to say that i agree with the majority of finnish russians or estonian russians liking the soviet union , it 's not like that 's the first thing i want to talk to them about . 
  i know there was a lot of commercial traffic between estonia and russia in the soviet union and that while russians were happy to get to shop in estonia , some estonians had negative experiences of the shops being cleaned out ( this is actually based on some research data i read ) . . but that does n't mean anybody was really anti-this or pro-that in terms of estonia and u.s.s.r. and if we 're completely honest i would n't mind the late soviet union under gorbatchev to putin 's russia after 2010 . . and tbh fascists is what you just call people you dislike nowadays . . 
  i remember most of soviet propaganda was about calling germans fascists , right ? 
  the `` estonian pov '' you are presenting here is probably also the one who wants to deny ethnic russians in estonia citizenship , as well as deport them all for `` spying for putin '' . 
  a large `` portion '' of the estonian pov , at least in the urban areas , is that russian estonians = estonian citizens and , in general , * people * -  which is how it should be . 
  we all agree putin is a dick . . so why should we help him ** divide and conquer ** , that 's literally a history book example of how to shoot ourselves in the leg . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is but like everywhere in the world , 99 % of any ethnic population are just your average joes . 
  that 's what makes the situation in estonia fucked up , because unlike finland , the estonian government does n't give them citizenship for whatever reason . 
  finnish media already was thinking critically on this whole `` our ethnic russians are scary and elite and in putin 's pocket '' issue when they interviewed people with dual citizenship a while ago . 
  the worst thing that can happen is that putin , like always , uses russian-speaking minorities as his own political cannon fodder , and * we let him * . 
  should we speak of people like `` thankfully we only have a small amount of you '' just because putin claims they `` belong to him '' and forces them into army service if they are dual citizens . 
  if anybody is in putin 's pocket , it 's us - because we seemingly believe him more than we do * our own people * . 
  going to be the devil 's advocate here , but i 've constantly heard that the ethnic russian minority in estonia is really marginalised and discriminated against . 
  and not in terms of the ukraine-russia conflict , because most russians in east ukraine ** identify ** as russian , whereas in estonia that 's not always the case . 
  i mean both sides probably dislike each other equally or whatever , but i personally am always critical when a majority language/ethnic group starts accusing a minority language/ethnic group of pretty much everything possible . 
  i really hate the fact the whole crimea/ukraine/putin stuff is occurring because everybody just refuses to consider if this is actually racism or not . 
  edit : calling them `` ethnic '' russians can be discussed a lot as well . 
  i mean we finns , estonians and russians are not so different culturally and for most estonian russians it 's just about being able to speak russian and travel to russia easier if they want .
