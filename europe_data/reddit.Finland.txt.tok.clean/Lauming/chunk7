  estonian russians ** are not ** some evil upper class , they are a mostly linguistic group which is actively ** refused ** estonian citizenship even though nearly all of them would like to apply for it . 
  2 sides to each story . 
  wait . . did you say most serbian people online do not * know * about bosnia , or that muslims live there ? 
  how does that work ? 
  oh and please , are you seriously going around making racist jokes and then listing different nationalities from `` goofy '' to `` butthurt '' ? 
  oh and p.s. 
  many would prefer `` pakistani '' or depending on home region , punjabi , rather than `` paki '' . 
  i 'm sorry but that is a load of bs . 
  americans , at least their politician ( s ) , constantly see themselves as victims . 
  then you see newspaper articles about how bad , bad , china and mexico treat poor , poor , u.s. and whatnot , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  and i 'm sorry but that is also a load of bs . 
  visegr\u00e1d 4 , or at least their politicians , constantly see themselves as victims . 
  then you see newspaper articles about how bad , bad eu and turkey treat poor , poor , hungary and poland and whatnot , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  and i 'm sorry but that , again , is a load of bs . 
  russians , or at least their politician ( s ) , constantly see themselves as victims . 
  then you see newspaper articles about how bad , bad , nato treats poor , poor , russia and whatnot , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  ** okay , a low quality post , but i was making a point ** . 
  if you only recognise the whole `` victim '' dialogue being unique to turkey , you need to look literally anywhere else and you 'll see it as well . 
  100 % you 'll find an article about how your own country does the same thing . 
  nobody in this world actively considers themselves oppressors , rather the other way around . 
  makes for quite effective political dialogue , as you can see with how the western world ( that includes turkey and russia ) have been voting for the past decade . 
  to be honest many people know about srebrenica and nothing about armenia . 
  and of course if , as u/charmack90 mentioned , bosnia/croatia/serbia are insignificant countries , armenia and the assyrians are probably even worse off . 
  and i do think the bosnian war is a really important topic to cover in history because it showcases how nationalism and patriotism are based on little to no actual facts or rational thinking . 
  the whole idea `` bosniak '' and `` serb '' ethnicities are troublesome , there were actual examples in the yugoslav wars of serbs `` cleansing '' other serbs , because the differences between serb , croat and bosniak are so miniscule . 
  i mean we have n't really learned much about how to write and teach history . 
  9/11 , in terms of deaths , was 1/3 of the bosnian war , and 1/500 of the armenian genocide , but a depressingly huge amount of people ( europeans , too ) know nothing about the two latter events . 
  and i do n't think any of us here are actively trying to downplay any of these events , but the way we teach and handle history tells ** a lot ** about us , our morals and political ideals today . 
  still do n't think that 's entirely the case , at least outside of germany . 
  it 's actually inside germany where the education system spends a lot of time on ww2 and attempts to not enforce nationalism in any way . 
  the latter one is not actually a bad thing . 
  it 's something that other countries should adopt . . having little kids sing national anthems every few weeks and learn unreliable/coloured accounts of national history is no different from forcing a religion on them before they 're old enough to choose for themselves . . which these kinds of education systems often do as well . 
  `` even '' my country 's accredited eduation system does this . 
  only lately can kids in more urban areas seek an alternative to religious education , and pretty much everybody 's patriotism is being pampered with the type of history education we teach our kids in k12 . 
  that 's the thing . 
  azeri-armenian border dispute -  bad blood . 
  azeris often considered not only turkic , but turkish -  more bad blood . 
  sort of the same case with albanians and serbians i guess . 
  devshirme drama and all that . 
  umm , no ? 
  i think it 's pretty obvious when someone recognises the remembrance day vs. when they , without knowing anything about the conflict and people themselves , use it to advance their already dubious arguments . 
  i mean i used to read the comments of eurovision song contest entries ( just to educate myself as a person i guess ) and you * do not * want to know the type of cancer the comments of armenian , azeri , bosnian , turkish and albanian music videos have . 
  russia gets away with it because the amount of russian eurovision fans are able to overpower the racist comments there . 
  it 's not even reddit where most users are of a similar demographic , depending on sub of course ( gender , age , nationality , etc. 
  ) , and it 's still worse circlejerking . 
  uhh . . what 's your point ? 
  my country can be seen as responsible for oppressing an indigenous ethnic group for a long time ( and is equally reluctant of admitting it ) but i do n't expect swathes of people to all vote for the 1 candidate in 1000 whose sole goal is recognising this issue ( that deals with * others * ) while i know many people do it ( albeit jokingly ) , i do n't go around antagonising my american friends because of trump . 
  there is no perfect democracy ( esp . 
  considering contemporary turkey . . and u.s. ) and as such blaming people for shit governments do should n't be a given . 
  and that 's because democracy is an imperfect system to begin with - i believe politics researchers are known to refer to it as the `` dysfunctional lesser evil '' quite often . 
  not sure i understood you , but my point was that the holocaust happened in western europe whereas the armenian genocide occurred in the middle east . 
  you can see people talk about 1 but not so much about the other . 
  still we call certain media outlets `` global media '' ( e.g. 
  cnn , bbc , al jazeera , etc. ), 
  even though actions show their reporting is anything but global or worldwide . 
  the listening post linked an awesome video on this topic today which is why i 'm bringing it up . 
  same reason why a massive terrorist bombing on a really important mausoleum in sindh province , pakistan a month or two ago was worthy of maybe one news article on bbc ( and the reddit thread was an obnoxious circlejerk about the pakistanis `` deserving it '' ) whereas gang violence in stockholm got people talking about it for weeks . 
  globalisation and `` global media '' misuse the word `` globe '' . 
  i do n't disagree with what you said but imo you 're treading the needle between saying the turkish government is fucked up ( which today at least it pretty much is ) and that the * turks * are somehow responsible/evil/etc . 
  idk why but the whole armenia-azerbaijan-turkey ethnic relations reminds me of the balkans and how the lines tend to obscure between governments and military rule to blaming ordinary people there as well . 
  we 've many examples already of why those lines should never blur . 
  rip . 
  what makes the whole thing sadder is that their deaths have been made into a political tool to advance certain movements ' agendas . 
  it 's quite disrespectful imo . 
  oh and many armenian movements themselves are also guilty of this . 
  calling out the turkish government for not recognising is one thing , preaching hate against azeris and turks on the expense of innocent people is another . 
  benedict anderson is a good author to get familiar with in order to recognise that what 's tragic about genocide is not the nationalities it affected , but the * people * . 
  west-centric media is making it increasingly hard but really people dying in kabul or yerevan should n't be treated differently from people dying in nyc or paris . 
  all right , `` indistinguishable '' is an aggregate term , but the words `` freedom '' and `` democracy '' are just that , words . 
  it 's a tricky discussion but when i speak of culture and national history i 'm not really sure how corruption and democracy fits in . 
  our culture is n't inherently more democratic than that of others , n'est pas ? 
  what makes the karelians of russia so vastly different from those of finland that their ethnic similarities should be ignored ? 
  i think turkey , finland , estonia and hungary all suffer from this idea that `` west '' is good and we need to work and work to become one with the `` west '' , whereas `` east '' is evil incarnate with whom we share no similarities whatsoever . 
  i would n't call you wrong . 
  i mean from outside inspection finland has much more in common with the baltics and poland than with iceland or denmark . 
  and similarly the baltics , poland and finland are infinitely more like russia than say , germany . 
  no matter how much it might trigger this sub , russia and russians are very very similar to many european countries and peoples in general . 
  i mean going outside europe most people are surprised russia is n't in the eu . 
  eye-opening to consider outside opinions and not just drown in insider bordering policies . 
  well yeah , but i meant more of in the swedish empire , kalmar , viking and norse-germanic sense of history and ancestry . 
  like all countries that are smaller than their neighbours ( mongolia , cyprus , korea , afghanistan . . ) , our history is very concerned with sweden and russia but the `` feeling is not mutual '' . 
  not trying to alienate the country or anything but like in estonia there are strong political agendas behind it , ergo making it seem are more western and unlike russia than we actually are . 
  ukraine and south korea are good examples where their relationship to their `` big scary neighbour '' makes them want to appear completely different . . 
  whereas if we 're quite honest they are indistinguishable from one another . . 
  even on a political level most times . 
  i mean finns have a hard time being nordic already . 
  not being a part of scandinavia , having a completely different ancestry and national history , speaking a non-related language and being behind the others in gdp , hdi , gender equality etc. 
  is a tough set of circumstances . 
  gini is the only one finland and estonia do well in but nobody really cares about it . 
  estonia would have to deal with the same challenges dialed up to eleven ( thousand ) . 
  but maybe we can all agree that being considered nordic does n't really matter too much . 
  i mean few people know of any of these countries and being scandinavian/nordic/etc hardly gives you any respect outside certain , really specific areas ( welfare policies and education mostly ) . 
  vaasa , tampere , turku and \u00c5land especially all have high values in that regard . 
  my generalisation is basically just in terms of population/pop . 
  density and other things . 
  the drop from uusimaa to < insert huge amount of municipalities the names of which i can barely pronounce  is quite huge compared to some other countries of similar size . 
  sure . 
  though we should keep in mind the whole `` eastern europe vs western europe '' thing is quite new . 
  i mean we 'll most likely see huge changes in our lifetimes . 
  full reversal is unlikely but france , iberia , the british isles and the nordics will definitely change .
