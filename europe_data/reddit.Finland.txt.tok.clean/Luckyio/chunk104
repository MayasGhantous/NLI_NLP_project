  please remember the  60 % that did n't vote for cameron and his party . 
  oh wait , that 's not how democracy works either . 
  sour grapes because `` plebs voted wrong '' are getting ridiculous . 
  we are not `` your brothers '' . 
  anyone who tells you otherwise is lying . 
  we are strangers that share some common interests . 
  you should not be so naive as to trust strangers . 
  that 's the first thing parents should teach their children frankly . 
  more likely , he understood what is at stake and what needed to be done . 
  folks who sat behind austria-hungary and poland typically forget the horrors of ottoman invasion and the significant difference between being invaded by ottoman and being invaded by european powers of the time . 
  no , you are talking about ethnic groups as a class . 
  that will have uniform voting policy . 
  that was your entire point . 
  would you like me to provide you with a quotation ? 
  here you go :  you 're linking the brexit vote , where the demographics are near 90 % white people , with an electorate which has 40 % minorities . 
   i 'll just close with this : the gop share of the black vote has held fairly constant for 10 running election . 
  the same is true of the hispanic vote . 
  only really the asian vote has moved in the last few decades to being only 25-30 % gop . 
  when in reality , that is one of the last criteria people who are n't distinctly racist vote for . 
  instead they typically vote based on their personal values , which vary wildly within any ethnic group . 
  literally , either throw the toys out of the pram , or hug everyone . 
  no middle ground whatsoever . 
  i wonder if you even realise that you just reinforced my point on just how alienated the europhilic crowd is from the people who voted against uk staying in eu . 
  noted . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  and more importantly , hungary demonstrated that it works in spite of protestations from eu leadership and frau merkel 's moans about betrayal . 
  by that logic , around 70 % of people in uk are ignored in general elections . 
  fuck the democracy , am i right ? 
  no , uk just got saved by the moat . 
  and us got saved by an even bigger moat . 
  morale of the story : moats are awesome , even without the alligators . 
  do you want a cookie , or shall i play world 's smallest violin for you over the internet ? 
  i do n't . 
  eea for example is a great thing . 
  political union is also a good thing to an extent . 
  free movement of people on the other hand has brought a huge amount of problems , while benefiting only those on top of the society . 
  this is likely the issue that caused brexit vote to go the way it did . 
  to those on top of the society , it 's a universally good thing . 
  to those on the bottom , it 's almost universally bad , and to those in the middle , it can go both ways . 
  but as less and less people are in the upper middle class and higher , and more and more are getting poorer and keep losing job prospects due to imported cheap labour , the society begins to fracture . 
  and that is indeed a direct fault of eu and insistence of its leaders on not allowing any limits of migration , to the point of looking the other way on illegal migration and blocking effective measures by member states to curb the effects . 
  hungary basically saved germany from the migrant crisis by demonstrating to countries on balkan route that having an actual border with proper border controls work . 
  the idea which had eu leadership threaten the country and it 's leadership for violating the base principles of eu , was what literally saved eu 's immigration policies . 
  if we had continuation of last year this year , you 'd be seeing `` brexits '' all across europe as everyone would start implementing full blown border controls to save themselves . 
  are you suggesting that europe was n't unified during that time ? 
  there 's a reason why people in greece are openly talking about eu occupation you know . 
  it 's all in the perspective . 
  i 'm sure germans of the time also saw themselves as unifiers and not occupiers . 
  hint : `` unification '' can be done through many various means . 
  suggesting that it 's a universally good thing is patently absurd . 
  but you 're ignoring the data , projecting marxist ideology of `` classes matter , people do n't '' into the situation and going with it . 
  can you spell `` ignorance '' ? 
  no , they would work in accordance with the local rules , which dictate minimum wage for each job . 
  our problem with low wage labour is that they in fact go against those rules , as well as taxation rules . 
  in addition to low education people losing their jobs , government ends up losing the tax revenue on the same people , as they systemically dodge taxes around here . 
  race to the bottom as it is happening in europe is in fact a western invention . 
  elite institutes top down freedom of movement , which benefits the said elite and massively depresses lower strata of society . 
  in the past , when elite instituted such systemic imbalance , it started to create societal tension . 
  if this tension goes without being released for a while , we got civil wars . 
  in this regard , britain got it 's release in the nick of a time , considering just how dangerously divided it has become . 
  give it a few more decades without such a release and jo cox will become a norm . 
   i 'm not a marxist . 
  all of the main points you raised are marxist . 
   this is your way of saying that you 're too lazy to do the effort to actually read the studies on american election demographics . 
  simplifying election demographics to racial or class lines is inherently racist and marxist . 
  and no , they 're not nearly that simple , as pointed out by the fact that trump 's rallies pull quite a bit of people from various ethnic minorities . 
  the salt is real . 
  there 's zero vitriol . 
  i 'm merely pointing out the obvious , that you did take the vote as a part of great britain and you lost . 
  just pointing out the obvious about outcome of democratic referendum is vitriolic ? 
   what malice and hatred ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pr29w/push_hard_for_united_states_of_europe_now/d4nf3va  first i was sad about how fucking dumb right wingers are , but at this point i see that a majority of people agree with them and i want them to fail . 
  they do n't deserve any better . 
   the working class are fucking idiots who are easily misguided by populists . 
  but here 's a clincher :  for over a decade i worked actively trying to improve their situation . 
  yes , how ** dare ** those people who because of ( apparently ) your actions lost their jobs and essentially all prospects in life , and who 's children are effectively doomed to the same fate , actually try choosing a different fate ignoring ** your ** desires . 
  ** you ** are obviously the only person who 's opinion counts , and ** your ** hard work is obviously the only thing of any value . 
  it 's not just malice and hatred . 
  it 's extreme narcissism as well . 
  and mind you , that 's not `` me demonising you '' . 
  all i did so far was point out your own words . 
  you are the one saying them . 
  not me . 
  so if you 're looking for someone to blame for you looking like an extremely malicious and hateful narcissist , perhaps now would be a good time to look in the mirror ? 
  `` please ignore the people who voted and just count the differential '' . 
  wow . 
  that is desperate . 
  and disgusting . 
  sadly , we have already done so in eu . 
  remember the irish referendum on lisbon treaty ? 
  because eu has already established a precedent that when you get a poll result you do n't like , and you belong to wealthy elite , you just poll again until your get the result that you do like . 
  scapegoating refers to * wrongly * attributing blame . 
  eu is directly to blame and praise for freedom of movement within europe . 
  as such , it is also correctly to blame for loss of opportunity among the people with low education level . 
  there is no scapegoating . 
  thank you for spelling out your malice and hatred toward people of different social class and/or political inclination . 
  in most cases , your types try to pretend to be somehow `` benevolent '' , so it 's refreshing to see someone so disturbed by reality hitting him in the face , that he openly professes his deep seated hatred instead . 
   you 're linking the brexit vote , where the demographics are near 90 % white people , with an electorate which has 40 % minorities . 
  not at all . 
  i 'm merely saying that only marxists with racist bent , such as yourself think that vote neatly splits among the `` ethnic group '' lines instead of in according of interests of people themselves .
