  all the actual discussions , he had no right to participate in them . 
  he had no right to propose anything . 
  he merely had the right to say `` i forbid '' in latin if proposal on the floor put by senators was against the interests of plebeians . 
  this is almost exact same situation we have in eu power structures . 
  the actual discussions that matter happen within commission . 
  parliament can talk all it wants . 
  it has no power to change what 's on the floor , because if it does - it goes back to the commission . 
  and political reality is , that parliament is highly unlikely to ever get this power . 
  this is both because , as i mentioned before , national governments do not want to create an actually powerful parliament that they can not to an extent control as is the case with commission today . 
  and because the current popular opinion which is on the rise is that eu already has too much , rather than too little legislative power in relation to sovereign states that form the eu . 
  you have pointed an ** irrelevant ** point , and now apparently i 'm the troll for pointing that out ? 
  you appear to hold a mistaken notion that it 's the rich people that matter in white flight . 
  they 're irrelevant . 
  what matters is middle class . 
  these people do not leave first . 
  they leave when they see that they are facing a threat . 
  in case of sweden , you 'd have masses of migrants be settled in a decent neighbourhood , and then you have people from around the area see that their culture is utterly incompatible and simply move out . 
  this frees more apartments in the area on the cheap , which are increasingly rented and bought by poor migrants and their descendants . 
  finally , you 're factually incorrect when you say that white flight is not a widely existing phenomenon in sweden . 
  that is simply the exact opposite of reality . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  most people never accepted this `` new religion '' . 
  they paid lip service to it , and nothing more . 
  the moment it began to impact their own existence , they would demonstrate their complete lack of tolerance for these people . 
  granted , often for very much understandable reason , for example who would want to raise little girls next to people from culture that believes that all these girls are sluts free for their sexual ( ab ) use . 
  reality is that people in general are not all that tolerant when something this different actually intrudes in their lives . 
  not even in sweden , as their white flight numbers and ghettoisation demonstrated very well . 
  they pay lip service to diversity , but reject it with their choice of life style . 
  and what happened in sweden is that this rejection could no longer take form in the form of benign white flight . 
  there were too many people coming - there was nowhere left to flee . 
  and suddenly , political pendulum swung in the other direction , hard . 
  so while still paying lip service to , as you put it , `` religion of diversity '' , they adapted some of the harshest rules in entire eu with extreme rapidity . 
  and literally no one but the few ignorant fools who genuinely believed that people were actually super tolerant and believed in this agenda seriously said a word against it . 
  it was widely accepted , and people will likely want more . 
  problem is , that this opens a huge can of worms . 
  when momentum swing is this extreme , it brings the violent elements out . 
  and we as a continent have a long history of extreme problems with this particular swing empowering elements that do not have best interests of people in mind , and who 's agenda is truly horrific . 
  and that is frankly mostly fault of the people in political class who consistently refused to address the problems that were growing for a long time underneath the surface of `` tolerance and multiculturalism '' . 
  ghettoes and segregation are the opposite of multiculturalism , but no one wanted to admit to it . 
  and now , everyone there will have to pay the price , to varying degrees . 
  you are lying . 
  the statement is that they are overwhelmingly treated about the same as locals , because they are locals . 
  no one stated that they are treated `` very well '' , which implies better treatment than that of locals as strangers , regardless of their ethnicity are most certainly not treated `` very well '' in any state in existence . 
  you attempts to manufacture hyperbolic arguments though lies and deceit are tiring . 
   christ sake , you people on this website . 
  thank you for spelling my point out for me . 
  let me see if i can make relevant text ** bold ** in hope that you have at least some ability to do more than copy paste political manifestos . 
   and does many other things , ** which are just as irrelevant to the particular point that was being discussed . 
  i think you simply do not understand how competition between branches of power works , and just how far people are willing to go to keep reigns of power to themselves . 
  when having to pick between the power and legislation , it will pick power . 
  every time . 
  as it should . 
  people who get that high in power circles go through heavy selection , where people who would actually give up power for `` good '' are the ones who get selected out . 
  brutally . 
  and when you hold all the cards , there 's no sense to do otherwise . 
  commission does point ( 1 ) , because there are no penalties for doing so . 
  then legislation is re-introduced as necessary . 
  because there is * no mechanism to compel it to do otherwise * . 
  which was the original point from get go . 
  the difference between us is that you 're pretending that point ( 1 ) is somehow bad for commission because `` well it wanted the legislation so surely it would accept '' . 
  which demonstrates complete ignorance of the very basic concept of politics - competition between branches for power . 
  you do not surrender the power you have to another branch just because `` you want to pass this piece of legislation as easily as possible '' . 
  instead you fight for it . 
  you 'd be utterly stupid not to , as all the cards but veto one are in the hands of the commission . 
   the fact that it moves between two cities is irelevant ; that 's a completely misinformed and ignorant argument . 
  thank you for confirming my point . 
  next time , consider reading what you 're actually replying to , to avoid getting embarrassed to this degree . 
  nice `` summary for 5 year old '' . 
  obfuscate , obfuscate , twist statements , ignore one 's own lies , pretend very hard that black is white . 
  truly , you are a politician . 
  `` if they do n't open their doors and welcome them in , they 're monsters ? '', 
  so after first presenting clearly false study on merits , shifting the goal posts when presented with falsehood of the study , you 're now going to go for full on hyperbole ? 
  well done . 
  here 's a line of thought for you . 
  consider the average middle class `` leftist '' . 
  what does he/she do , when a bunch of migrants from middle east and north africa move into his neighbourhood ? 
  statistics are very clear on what they do . 
  they turn around and leave . 
  in droves . 
  it 's called `` white flight '' and it 's a widely studied phenomenon . 
  what happened last year was a frightening realisation that with those numbers , there was nowhere to flee the `` invaders '' any longer . 
  and that is when they agreed to push back in spite of all the public moaning . 
  because for all the talk , when people feel threatened , they will do what it takes . 
  worst part is , now that people tasted the fear , the seeds have been sown . 
  this is just the beginning of something far more scary . 
  and i 'm not certain we can stop that any more . 
  sweden is dead on in so many ways . 
  it also moves between two cities . 
  and does many other things , which are just as irrelevant to the particular point that was being discussed . 
  we 're done i think . 
  you are now wilfully engaging in long form `` say as much as possible with as little content as possible '' common among political class when they wish to obfuscate the topic in mindless , irrelevant minutiae . 
  i will summarise my point one last time : parliament lacks power to propose legislation and vote on it , making it legally binding . 
  power that is generally present within national parliaments . 
  which makes the point of `` who are their actual subjects '' the only real variable , does n't it ? 
  machiavellian leaders have no friends or enemies . 
  they have interests . 
  those who want an equally realistic scenario in video game format , i recommend homefront . 
   welcome to the quintessential problem in all western democracies !, 
  this was even referenced on a the simpsons episode ... high quality critique .
