  nice touch . 
  you sure sank low with that one . 
  i suppose i should be thankful you did n't call us jews . 
  and then , like a proper islamist , suggest that we need to be exterminated , rather than just `` get out '' . 
   just because truth hurts does n't mean denying it is going to help you . 
  just because truth hurts does n't mean denying it is going to help you . 
  going to be interesting to see how that is going to get explained . 
  frankly , russians and ukrainians have been told to crack down on their ultras for years by uefa . 
  instead they seem to have both completely ignored the problem , and now they get this . 
  internal devaluation was what kept their economy afloat . 
  it 's quite different from the crisis that joke was made about , when inflation was uncontrollable and ridiculously fast . 
  factually false . 
  christianity is purely a religion . 
  it specifically separates political world on doctrinal level from religion , and it does not contain fully self contained legal framework . 
  islam is very much an exception in the world of major religions in this aspect , which is the main reason why it spread as fast as it did at the cost of other major religions . 
  something that continues to this day . 
  anyone who remembers the example of anatolia and the speed with which it fell to islam understands just how different it is and how worrisome this trend is . 
  considering the popularity of akp , i would argue that your number comes out of your ass . 
  they are islamists and they enjoy overwhelming majority support . 
  just not among the city elites who understand to an extent that islam is regressive and they like their higher quality of life and secular rights . 
  it also does n't help that a lot of people in that upper class still feel very guilty about not being proper muslims , as evidenced by a lot of them going to fight for is after rediscovering their faith . 
  incorrect . 
  islam has a doctrinal concept of `` abrogation '' . 
  google it . 
  few people who are known to have tried to pretend that abrogation does n't exist , or apply it in the other direction ( mekkan quaran over medinan texts and hadiths ) have gotten death sentences for apostasy and were executed in islamic states . 
  he was a radical regressive leftist who was , among other things a vegetarian . 
  in his trial , he went on record to say that his motive was `` preventing fortuyn from picking on muslims and other weak people '' . 
  which is helluva odd , considering how much stronger they are when it comes to killing people for having opposing views . 
  i am in fact . 
  should not post when i 'm this tired . 
  fortuyn was the politician who died two years prior by a hand of extremist regressive leftist who said `` he killed him for using islamists as scapegoats '' . 
  that is indeed a solid comparison , as it seems , at least for now that this was a kill for similar motives by the member of extreme right this time . 
  wait , what 's wrong with homosexuality ? 
  islam is the law and word of god . 
  many forget that islam is not merely a religion , but entire system of life . 
  to a religious person , such a system would obviously take precedent to heretical law systems of apostate secularists and humanists . 
  edit : corrected by user below . 
  thing being , china does n't actually threaten a military consequence to get things done in a land that is n't even on the same continent as themselves . 
  they do things very differently . 
  instead they offer good business deals , loans to finance them and manpower to do them . 
  and they do n't attach moral strings to those offers . 
  which is both troubling from human rights perspective and very peaceful in nature . 
   ** i ** highly doubt this . 
  i 've heard ** dozes ( sic ) of people complaining about that happening ** followed by :  you are generally allowed to ask someone to back his shit up narcissism it is . 
  you clearly think that since you were n't present during the shit storm that was / r/europe last year , ** other ** people need to do hours of collation just to convince ** you ** that it indeed happened . 
  really , ** you ** are not worth it . 
  that is the problem . 
  modern social networks are `` circlejerks '' by their nature , but they 're more useful than your average `` circlejerk '' by a mile and then some . 
  you seem to think this is a court room , and i 'm making accusations . 
  or you think that you as an individual command such importance as to suggest that hours of footwork that would need to be done to provide you with evidence on point you raise is worth it to those that have to do the work . 
  that 's narcissistic to the extreme . 
  this is a social media forum . 
  you are the one arguing against the popular opinion that is well established at this point . 
  i provide you with venue that you can use to find out why it is that your opinion differs significantly from popular opinion . 
  whether you choose to do the footwork , or simply make due without is your choice and your alone . 
  i think you 're confusing `` population replacement '' with `` population replenishment '' . 
  what we need is replenishment . 
  maintaining the ratio of young to old people , to maintain the numbers we have and societal order that is built on having these numbers . 
  problem is that it 's a popular line of thinking among the elite right now is that replacement is as good as replenishment for the same goal . 
  many of the problems we 're facing with migrants from extremely backwards , culturally conservative societies come from this thinking and significant top down resistance to chang . 
  to clarify , i mean by pan-european standards , those cultures that are far more socially conservative than say poland or hungary , societies that thing that human rights are a luxury , women are lesser humans than men and so on . 
  suprisingly when you bring these people to replace your own population while living in a liberal democracy , liberal democracy and values of enlightenment get increasingly suppressed by the extremely socially conservative newcomers that have no respect for them and significant internal culturally rooted desire to tear them down as offensive to their own . 
  best evidence is the deletion and ban sprees on / r/europe that occurred at the breaking point ( when most people stopped buying into the pr and started to see the reality for what it is due to the migrant crisis and terrorism related issues ) about a year ago are heard about so many times specifically because they were so extreme even by reddit standards . 
  you can find many mentions of them , but as it is with social networks , `` hard evidence '' of specific state of specific subforum at specific time is almost impossible to come by - because of the nature of the issue , rather than lack of credibility behind the claims . 
  you can probably still find some evidence you 're asking for on / r/undelete by going to the specific time frame and looking for relevant time frame . 
  but that is the foot work you 'll have to do on your own . 
  it 's a major issue in many places . 
  we here up north had almost no burglary until eu came around , and we got the baltic gangs do their `` drive through burglaries '' , where they enter the state , drive through breaking into homes and cleaning them out as they go and then exit into sweden before they are caught ( and in many cases , before victims even had the time to find that crime occurred and report it , as they typically focus on summer homes and such ) . 
  but due to its nature , adding more police is not very likely to provide major assistance on the issue , as perpetrators are in and out of the country quickly in most cases , specifically to avoid attention from the police . 
  this is the kind of problem that is n't really fixable without border controls . 
  i think you need to relax a bit here . 
  it 's a competition for jobs . 
  many of those supporting brexit are the polish immigrants with permanent right to stay . 
  they are in on it for the same reason . 
  less competition from newcomers that keep squeezing everyone . 
  does poland face a labour shortage right now ? 
  i was under assumption that just like we import folks from eastern european states like poland , baltic states , spain and so on , those countries import people from even poorer states like russia , ukraine , romania and so on . 
  to be fair , easiest way to get karma a year ago was to shit on someone who dared to mention anything negative about islamism . 
  than has changed 180 degrees in just a year . 
  chances are , other points of `` must silence people and lie '' will change eventually . 
  it 's just that big ships turn slowly . 
  this relativism is silly . 
  `` they 're at fault because they let them in and assumed they 'd play by the rules '' . 
  hey , how about not treating greeks and their governing forces as mindless animals that just ca n't help not following the rules , and instead treating them like human being who can make their own choices ? 
  that holds true for greece as well . 
  and well , about half of europe . 
  we 've been here before , so it 's reasonably predictable . 
  you 're looking at civil strife , rise of extremism and possible civil war in long term unless this anger is not quelled in one way or another . 
  did they also manipulate the levers attached to said balls ? 
  real reason can not be mentioned for reasons of political correctness . 
  `` our official statement as follows : our equipment was deeply confused by the feelings of the people in the chain . 
  to make the equipment feel better and not accidentally try to guide some drones to bomb the said chain , we 'll run a few extra bombings in the following weeks in various shit holes around the world . '', 
  does truth make you uncomfortable ? 
  then open discussion forums may not be for you . 
  yes , that would be the pr lying , same as here . 
  as we have seen with europe in the past , reality turns out to be dramatically different in the end , because eu is built on bending and breaking the rules to keep the system going . 
  seriously , have you been under the rock for last half a decade and missed the elephant in the room that was the debt crisis ? 
  spoiler : politicians lie . 
  not at all . 
  some aspects of free movement of people do not apply .
