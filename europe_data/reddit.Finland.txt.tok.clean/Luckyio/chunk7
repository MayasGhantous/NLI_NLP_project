  wealth ? 
  participation in civil service of some kind ? 
  all of these are combined by single factor . 
  they are all wholly irrelevant to the discussion . 
  or worldwide ? 
  why just this year ? 
  the typical actions of someone desperate to define extremely narrow criteria to exclude all the murders they know happened but they 'd prefer not to talk about . 
  use any of definitions you offered . 
  the choice is yours . 
  they are irrelevant , as number does n't change . 
   this is literally meaningless . 
  if a single murderer can be used as an example of all muslims , why not a large scale christian group responsible for many atrocities . 
  you just answered your own question by comparing a single person to a group with religious agenda . 
  now turn the question around so that islamic side has the religious agenda and you answer your own question correctly . 
  in other words , you do have the capacity to ask the correct question and comprehend the answer . 
  you just do not wish to . 
  and the answer to initial question is still zero . 
  that is zero terror attacks by christian religious extremists that claim christian dogma as their reason for doing so . 
  excellent , we 're in agreement on my second point . 
  you still failed to address my first and more important query :  explain why . 
  also explain why it 's equal and fair that mother can renounce her parental obligations at any time , including after birth of the child , whereas father can not at any time . 
  be specific on why this is as you claim ** fair ** . 
  so basically , either we 're with you , or you get to call us names because clearly your cause is just and everyone who is against you is a terrible person . 
  those who forget history are truly doomed to repeat it . 
  to make this claim , you now have to make the claim that these were not the ones who did n't even vote and that their reasons were n't more nuanced , they just were n't asked for nuance as studies typically do . 
   i think it 's perfectly fair that the father should pay . 
  the mother should just sue him for child support and the money should be collected like taxes . 
  explain why . 
  also explain why it 's equal and fair that mother can renounce her parental obligations at any time , including after birth of the child , whereas father can not at any time . 
  be specific on why this is as you claim ** fair ** . 
  also explain why in some states , man can be accused of being a father and has no legal recourse , because women 's right movement made paternity tests illegal and how that is fair . 
  it was a joke . 
  i got the reference . 
  if you ca n't laugh at the situation , you 're really fucked . 
  so at least laugh . 
   which is utterly irrelevant to the fact that there are christian murdering terrorists who have acted in every way worse than this man , yet you have defended them against the `` christian '' label . 
   here , the murderer is clearly unhinged , yet you are desperate to try and categorise every single muslim with him . 
  faith : idea . 
  follower of faith : person . 
  another concept you do n't appear to have any understanding of . 
   christians are n't ? 
  well , what 's the point in even continuing this conversation . 
  you have n't got a goddamn clue what 's going on . 
  you should spend less time reading stormfront and more time reading wikipedia . 
  let 's put your hypothesis to test . 
  how many terrorist attacks did we have this year where perpetrator based his actions on christian dogma ? 
  zero . 
  how many based on islamic dogma ? 
  at least three in europe , many more worldwide . 
  consider getting off wikipedia and reading relevant literature . 
  you 're talking trade . 
  i 'm talking investments . 
  example : our and eu money was used to finance estonian power plants that work on their weird messed up shale . 
  these are massively profitable and they export electricity pretty much everywhere . 
  profits are theirs to keep . 
  direct investments on good terms with minimal strings attached are the main form of uplifting that western development model allows for . 
  she grew a penis ? 
  maybe feminists actually got it right when they said that only men oppress women , and does that mean that any woman that rises to position of power will grow a pair ? 
  considering that i had some connections with massive power plants estonia currently uses to export electricity that cost a fortune that was financed through us and are making them a fortune now and will do so for a long time to come , i 'm going to ask just what more did you expect us to do ? 
  surrender our entire state budgets to you ? 
  there is no strawman . 
  my argument was clear - western europe invested heavily in uplifting eastern european warsaw pact and former ussr states after ussr collapsed . 
  this was in 1991 and heavy investments lasted for at least a decade if not more , depending on the state . 
  you decided to conflate this with eu budget for some reason that i still do n't really understand . 
  most of relevant states were n't even a part of eu at the time . 
   there 's no such thing as race . 
  you are clearly too ignorant to discuss this with . 
  well trolled . 
  / golflclap  here 's you defending terrorists from the accusation of being christian :   not at all . 
  nothing in the bible tells people to murder anglicans quote you provide offers nothing you claim it provides . 
  it merely provides the specific statement i already explained about specifics of religious dogma . 
  it is factually correct and indisputable that there is nothing in the bible that tells anyone to go kill anglicans . 
  as i noted above , there are specific , detailed guidelines and laws in hadiths on how to define apostates and heretics , how to evaluate the depth of their crime in face of islamic religious dogma , what punishment should be administered and in what way . 
  this is because hadiths and sharia function as an actual legislative framework , something completely absent in christian dogma . 
   why are christian terrorists excluded from your ire ? 
  same reason why buddhist , taoist , and any other religious denominations . 
  they 're not ones doing the overwhelming majority of violent oppressing of human rights worldwide . 
  islamic dogma and islamic terrorists are . 
  i have a tendency of talking about problems that are bigger first , instead of ignoring the elephant in the room in favour of fly on the wall . 
   i know this must be hard for someone as simple minded as yourself to comprehend , but when you bomb people practically back into the stone age , and then they become devoted to an extreme religious sect and fight back against you , blame there is not universally placed on one side . 
  smart people can recognise `` oh yeah murdering all those brown people probably contributed to this ! '', 
  cool story which explains nothing about the current events . 
  caliphate was spread all the way to spain and ottoman slaving of europe lasted for countless centuries and they reached vienna . 
  ever wondered why `` slave '' and `` slav '' are so similar ? 
  why are we not suicide bombing them ? 
  surely there are plenty of us with far larger grievances ? 
  also , you should actually get out of your safe space and visit middle east sometime . 
  if that 's stone age , i sure as hell would love to live in one . 
  common history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth poles picked you up for sponsorship , we picked estonians . 
  latvia got the short end of the stick . 
  we have tried . 
  he hit us with his stick for it quite a few times . 
  minsk 2 is still not ratified in kiev for example . 
   racist : someone who is prejudiced against identifiable groups of humans based on stereotyping and sweeping generalisations . 
  pulling definitions out of your ass does n't make them real . 
  racism is discrimination based on race . 
  your `` definition '' of racism covers essentially any and all discrimination , ranging from sexism to racism to just literally being a healthy person with sexual preference of any kind . 
  which is patently absurd . 
   you defend christian terrorists , yet condemn 1.6 billion people for the action of a mentally unhinged man .
