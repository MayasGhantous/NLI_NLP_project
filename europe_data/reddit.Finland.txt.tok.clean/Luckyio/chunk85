  the rest is pure obfuscation . 
  you list several countries where slavery is strictly illegal , and can only work in criminal underworld , as if that is somehow comparable to legally sanctioned slavery that exists in many islamist countries today . 
  that is a false equivalence if i ever saw one . 
   how on earth do you find that comparable to putin bombing chechnya for years and displacing most of their population ? 
  i do n't , simply because that 's not what happened in chechnya in the first place . 
  unless you are of opinion that putin has a time machine , and managed to control russia 's actions back when he had no significant political power . 
  and with russians , it 's never about just waving your militarist dick around . 
  that 's the main rake that war party folks like you keep stepping on , and never learning anything from the headache it causes you . 
  something that someone that has little to no experience on topic and genuinely holds the patently factually false beliefs you espoused in messages above is not equipped to understand . 
  it 's actually bewildering to me just how deeply some people project their own fears upon those from other nations , knowing little about them . 
  in reality , we learned to live with russia long ago . 
  you get some really scared folks who do go overboard , but most people generally understand that as long as we maintain our credible military deterrent and remain neutral on the imperial games of the world , we 're going to be just fine . 
  unlike all the new states that keep wanting to play the geopolitics for one side or another as an easy way out that keeps backfiring , we are far more experienced in co-existence and what needs to be done to keep it peaceful . 
  i also like how you manage to argue against yourself , stating that `` conquering a region that definitely is n't feeling like belonging to you '' is bad , and in the same sentence stating that `` it 's good when it 's not russia doing it '' . 
  having your cake and eating it too , are n't we ? 
  my understanding of the convention is that it only prohibits recreational use . 
  decriminalisation for medicinal use is allowed under the treaty . 
  as far as i know , one of the main arguments among those who want legalization is the medicinal use , rather than recreational one . 
  i would argue that biggest obstacle is hence not the international treaty one , but the fact that in most states , there 's a very large minority or even straight up majority that is completely against legalisation . 
  that basically means that any politician that would argue for legalisation would have a very small group to gain as his supporters , but risk alienating a very large portion of voter base . 
  ( full disclosure : i 'm against legalisation for anything other than as a prescription drug with similar limitations as ones instituted for strong opioids and other highly addictive substances ) . 
  it 's not about duration of workday , it 's how you use it . 
  japanese and south korean office workers routinely pull 60-70 work hour weeks . 
  if you ever saw how that works , large portions of that work day are not actually about work . 
  it 's about socializing with other people , eating lunch , browsing their social media and so on . 
  on the other hand , countries that have well under 40 hour work weeks but that 's actual intensive work compete with those two quite well . 
  no , it merely means that i recognise your moral relativism as that of your opinion and nothing more than that . 
  you have a right to your opinion . 
  i have a right to point out that it 's completely out of whack with reality , as i have above on several points which you chose not to contest once pressed at all and the single point on which you chose to contest it presenting mainly accusations and attacks against me rather than arguing against my points . 
  and as the old saying goes , opinions are like assholes . 
  everyone has one . 
  what differentiates is reasons you present for having said opinion , and articulating those reasons at significant depth as for other people to understand why you think the way you do . 
  i have done so . 
  how you choose to interpret it , and if you choose to actually read my points or just project your own self image upon me is all up to you . 
  that particular fact is widely accepted outisde the war party folks . 
  the claim typically made that i think is probably factually correct is that leadership and spearhead in the endgame was provided by russians from outside . 
  that overwhelming majority of those outside military bases were soldiers that deserved from those bases and other locals is not a point of contention , as is the fact that crimeans ( as in locals ) overwhlemingly supported joining russia and still do to this day in spite of heavy sanctions placed on their everyday lives . 
  so i guess in your world , moon is indeed made of cheese . 
  i have no interest in `` neutrality '' ** as you see it ** . 
  i have interest in peace and anti-war . 
  ** in your eyes ** , `` neutrality '' is clearly pro-war and on your side . 
  i like how you use so many weasel words in there to pretend that my argument is not what i make it out to be , but something that you can use to pretend i 'm like you instead . 
  and end up projecting that i 'm like you - a shill for a cause rather than an outsider commenting on how he sees the situation . 
  full disclosure : this is the only reddit account that i ever had , and no , i do not have `` pro kremlin biases '' . 
  especially considering that someone who 's in finnish reserve , any escalation we 'd have with russia , it would be my neck on the line , as it would be many of my friends . 
  i have pro-peace biases , and anti-war party biases however for aforementioned reasons , which to you are clearly the same thing . 
  hilariously , the most insulting thing about your post to me is that you would think that i would pick a name as bad as yours or one you state as my handle after noting that i do in fact spend quite a bit of time articulating my point . 
  basically they rely on the fact that uk will keep their grid up and running . 
  same way denmark temporarily solved it 's reliability problems due to wind - pull lots of interconnects to southern sweden , and have them reserve much of their hydro capacity as spinning reserve for denmark . 
  when i was talking about `` war zones '' , i was in fact referring to war zones . 
  specifically the regions of donbass currently engaged in active warfare . 
  i imagine that after massive wave of rejections of asylum applications across eu from them , many of them applied for work permits instead . 
  most of them are educated people , as soviet union had a good professional education system which ukraine likely inherited , so these would be trained professionals that would actually be able to get a job in their field in eu . 
  at least if what i saw on ship wharfs here in finland and work sites in poland is to be trusted . 
  i know for a fact that quite a few of them arrived in various eu countries , and were overwhelmingly rejected . 
  if it makes it easier for you to think of me as `` triggered '' , you 're certainly free to think so . 
  in reality , i simply explained why as someone who lives in a country with longer border with russia then rest of eu combined and who has gone through mandatory conscription , and is in military reserve , i find it hard to condemn those that defend their state and home against what they see as unconstitutional overthrow orchestrated by a mix of extremists within their country and imperialist outside influence . 
  `` islamic caliphate of europe is coming and it 's pointless to resist . '', 
  last two tries did fail in fact . 
  cordoba caliphate was defeated , as was ottoman empire . 
  i 'm pretty sure that once we get over the white guilt bs , this third assault on europe by islamists is going to end in our victory again . 
  too real . 
  one has to remember that while us most certainly does try to influence elections in european states as most of these are effectively it 's foreign policy satellites in the world , this influence has limits . 
  consider brexit as a good case where this influence failed . 
  i would suggest that they achieve far more through more insidious means , such as direct influence upon the parts of bureaucracy and politicians already elected . 
  remember , they have the ability to listen in to any active , working phone , laptop and search any content on those , as well as any internet traffic flowing between states . 
  that means they have blackmail material on every single politician . 
  and remember how snowden himself described how they got material on a banker when he was with cia in switzerland . 
  `` set up a car accident where he is a guilty party , and then us agents save him from having to bear guilt '' . 
  essentially better than blackmail . 
  debt due to gratitude . 
  you can control a target person with that far better , and the target person will actually think you as a good actor rather than a bad one in case of blackmail . 
  it 's also worth remembering that every major imperial state does this . 
  russia most certainly does it for example , as does china . 
  the issue is that their capabilities are but a tiny fraction of those commanded by us . 
  i would imagine that would be mostly refugees from the war zones . 
  i 'm still pissed at our countries that these people are overwhelmingly rejected . 
  crimea was taken over primarily by crimeans . 
  eastern ukrainian rebels are also people who live in their own territories , while folks trying to take these territories back are overwhelmingly not locals . 
  nationalists want to take over these territories from the locals . 
  on the bright side , at least you war party folks do n't try to pretend it 's all evil russians coming from outside , and admit it 's just weaponry supplied to locals defending their homes . 
  that 's progress . 
  and can you really cast blame on these locals ? 
  they elected a president who represented them that was unconstitutionally overthrown by force of violence with support from outside the country , and now a new president and government is installed that wants them violently suppressed by force of arms . 
  considering the current situation , i find it very hard to blame them for it . 
  if russia did the same thing in finland that us did in ukraine , i 'd be the first in line of volunteers to stand against it . 
  the 1 % are overwhelmingly `` useful idiots '' . 
  people who are fed the story that they are better than the rest and are in control of their lives , while they have very little actual control . 
  they 're nothing but a buffer for absorbing shocks caused by unhappiness of the masses below . 
  the people you 're looking at leading the whole thing are far , far fewer . 
  the fact that you are emphasizing the national identity as key aspect of the conflict and completely denounce the religious aspect demonstrates the point i outlined above very well . 
  and that 's a good thing . 
  that means significant progress has been achieved , and more is likely to follow if current direction holds . 
  language is far from the only point of difference between the two . 
  it 's not even the main point of disagreement . 
  that lies in the political direction which country should take , in which east and west of the country have diametrically opposed differences that were so intolerable to west , that they staged an armed coup just to remove president that shared easterners ' values . 
  in case of northern ireland , while it 's difficult for many modern people to understand the concept of religiosity so deep that it would be the main source of animosity , one does n't have to look beyond the modern islamism to see that it does indeed exist even today . 
  simply worshipping a deity in a slightly wrong way is a sufficient slight to require those seeking to correct the slight to be fully willing to go to war and murder the offender and everyone associated with him/her over it . 
  luckily , western peoples have largely gotten over this religiosity through cultural evolution to the point where most of our religious wars are fought with words rather than with guns , bombs and guillotines . 
  that is why i 'm hopeful that same is occurring in northern ireland .
