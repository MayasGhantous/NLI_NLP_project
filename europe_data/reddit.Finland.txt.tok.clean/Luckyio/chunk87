  if you actually read the story , it makes it clear that this is not an edge case . 
  murderer commands a sizable support within the relevant community , and many people within it openly say that they completely understand and support his motives . 
  it 's fully in line with last time it was used , when georgia assaulted south ossetia during the same time frame , and all the same shills accused russia of reacting to the attack instead , as if it was the aggressor . 
  which was later debunked by eu report on the issue of all things . 
  same shills are still pedlling the same narrative however . 
  small naps and massive amount of training . 
  and no . 
  this is just awareness project . 
  the actual solar panel + propeller engine + large wing concept has been flying for two decades at this point : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasa_pathfinder https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasa_centurion, 
  no worries . 
  they can vote as many times as necessary , as long as they vote correctly in the end . 
  only by your standards . 
  even cursory knowledge of history would match my words . 
  but in your case , the old saying does indeed ring true . 
  pick cheap/free or good . 
  ca n't have both . 
  we know what kind of facts you choose . 
  that would mostly be because back then , mortality was around 50-60 % just during childhood from infectious diseases . 
  you do n't really give much of a fuck about random people far away when any wound that breaks skin has a pretty good chance of causing an agonizing death from infection . 
  today we 're used to the fact that our lives are generally pretty safe . 
  most people will reach adulthood without getting maimed or killed by disease , wild animals or just plain fanatical human on human violence . 
  and now that suddenly we 're massively regressing on the last portion , people are starting to get worried . 
  it was n't a greek-turkish conflict folks . 
  you heard it here first . 
  and probably last too . 
  no one else would try to peddle a narrative this idiotic . 
  do n't worry , the new narrative is that it 's not bad . 
  it 's just that we 're too well informed . 
  take a look at / r/europe 's newest regressive posting : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4un1md/ray_kurzweil_the_world_isnt_getting_worse_our/, 
  nice angle . 
  i see it , and i raise cyprus civil war . 
  your move . 
  in other , news , in your glorious country , they ca n't even fill 1/3 of police academy positions , and are thinking of lowering the standards . 
  in climate where sweden is suffering from severe lack of police officers already . 
  but hey , it 's * me * who is living in a bubble . 
  til : `` twisting facts to ignore reality '' is the same as `` stating facts '' . 
  then again , with your flag , it is a common lie in current culture in sweden . 
  you probably simply do not know any better . 
  no worries . 
  those who ignore history are known to repeat it , but in our recent history , those who ignored history usually got purged before they succeeded in regressing the society far enough . 
  being a foolish child is ok . 
  being a foolish grown up comes with consequences . 
  i 'll let you think about it . 
  yeah , i mean all they do is complain we 're not meeting their religious standards and just submit to their religious theocracy . 
  as we all know , we should celebrate such actions , after all this theocracy would be a blessing . 
  allahu akbar brother . 
  we have n't completely regressed to the 70s and 80s age of internal uprisings . 
  awesome !, 
  in case you ever wonder why people with your brand of apologia are called `` regressives '' , this would be one of the main reasons . 
  with your help , soon enough we 'll regress to civilization warfare of middle ages , when islam was controlling and enslaving large portions of europe . 
  is is simply the new name for the islamic caliphate , the islamic state that is clearly outlined in islamic holy texts as the ideal state . 
  essentially all jihadist attacks are done in the name of this concept . 
  the only thing that changes is the people doing it . 
  religious dogma causing them stays the same . 
  * this week * , * one of the several attacks * was in fact not a terror related attack !, 
  i will simply end on making a point that `` hoop '' represents * effort that needs to be spent * , not an * obstacle with significant requirements to bypass * . 
  there 's a huge difference , one you appear to be utterly unaware of . 
  overwhelming amount of privacy related materials for people are readily available for those * willing to spend effort to get that information * . 
  yet we have very few who actually make the effort . 
  which is why many of privacy protections built into legal systems are typically specifically about such hoops . 
  to argue against this , you would have to argue against massive amount of experience we have with this issue and frankly one of the strongest drivers in human nature . 
  germany hosts us nuclear bombs . 
  us troops are known to fuck up and blow them up every once in a while , sometimes alongside the entire aircraft . 
  that 's why they no longer can ferry them over spain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_palomares_b-52_crash https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_thule_air_base_b-52_crash this law allows them to prosecute people planning a similar effort intentionally , even if they did n't take part in the action . 
  `` stupid law '' ? 
  are you suggesting that privacy of the victim is less important than your infantile desire to be a voyeur ? 
  ordinary voyeurs like yourself wo n't bother to jump through the hoops . 
  the hoops are there for a reason . 
  it 's just like a lock . 
  sure , anyone who bothers to learn a specific set of skills and gets a modern lock pick can pick lock . 
  does n't mean locks do n't keep people out , including those with that set of skills and a lock pick . 
  it 's all about requiring a specific amount of time and effort vs value of what 's behind the obstacle . 
  which is odd , because david is an acceptable muslim name , simply due to judaic roots of that religion . 
  king david was one of the early profets of allah after all . 
  there 's discussion on that very topic in the thread linked above . 
  there 's also the fact of the recent french complaint to microsoft referencing their `` excessive data collection on windows 10 users '' which microsoft did not in any way deny in their response . 
  that 's actually a part of update they had to armed forces structure . 
  they have worked for years on reworking the reserve structures , because most people were supposed to be `` assigned to their posts as these posts are created in pre-war preparation process '' . 
  they changed it slightly , and it made them send many of us reservists letter with updated information on our role in case of war . 
  most people do n't even know that we have universal conscription here in finland . 
  that 's likely one of the reasons why most people do n't want to join nato - we adult finnish men know that in case mccain and co ever get into power in us , we would be the ones who would have to die for their imperial ambitions if we were to join nato . 
  in most european states , you have a professional army , so your risk of actually having to fight for nato is far lower . 
  for people like me , that 's a very real risk on the other hand , because we 're all reservists . 
  you have heard propaganda mixed with the fact that our only major party that is pro nato ( the right wing party that lost its prime minister post in last elections ) is still the one that wants to actively talk about it , because they 're the only ones who want to change status quo . 
  our numbers on joining nato were at their highest in 2008-2009 when russia was wealthy enough to have russians buy so much property on our eastern border ( typically cottage at a lake for vacations ) , that prices rose out of reach of locals . 
  who made a lot of complaints about it , turning many against russia in public opinion for a while , and we hit a record , where only ~ 50 % of people were against joining nato , and support for it rose to almost 30 % . 
  it brought the aforementioned party to talk about `` game changer '' in that for the first time in our history , joining nato would not be opposed by clear majority of people . 
  it did n't happen , instead as economy in russia levelled out , purchases dropped in numbers and price inflation slowed down . 
  locals also started making increasingly more money on tourism . 
  right now it 's back down to where it usually is . 
  55-60 % against , 20-25 % for , 20-25 % undecided . 
  this is the most recent of the yearly results for our state broadcaster 's poll on the topic , that shows you the progress before and after ukraine conflict ( 2013-2015 ) : http://yle.fi/uutiset/suomalaisten_nato-kannat_ennallaan__epavarmojen_osuus_kasvanut/8408558 blue is `` for joining '' , red is `` against joining '' and gray is `` undecided '' . 
  it follows the typical curve we have , where something major occurs and for a short while we have a spike of reduction of `` against '' and `` undecided '' votes that shift to `` for '' camp , then people shift from `` for '' camp to `` undecided '' , and then even more shift from `` for '' to `` undecided '' and from `` undecided '' to against '' as situation stabilizes and we see that status quo on our border still remains in spite of all the noises from outside our immediate vicinity . 
  no , so that we would have good psychiatrists get inside his skull and figure out what makes his particular brand of extremist tick , and how to detect it early if possible . 
  does n't work that way , or they have been nailed for it long ago with kinect . 
  10/10 for effort . 
  1/10 for success rate . 
  i would argue that they should have made more effort to grab him alive of possible to question him . 
  perhaps using gas , tranquiliser darts , tazers , or just hitting him with a vehicle at high enough speed or incapacitate him , but possibly avoid lethal outcome .
