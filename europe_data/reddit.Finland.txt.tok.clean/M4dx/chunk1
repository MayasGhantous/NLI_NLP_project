every party has things they support that are unpopular with people who support other parties . 
  that 's why there is different parties . 
  i think it 's somewhat weird to say that prime minister 's personal views are different to what wide parts of finnish society has when his party had most votes and he personally almost had the most votes . 
  especially about that nato support when it is n't anymore small minority which supports nato . 
  before the nazis chose the swastika as their symbol , it was used as a symbol of good luck in the world . 
  so when in 1918 finnish air force was established , they chose to have blue swastikas in [ the side of the planes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/esc6qfd.gif ) and later [ akseli gallen-kallela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akseli_gallen-kallela ) designed the official air force emblem with black swastika . 
  after the world war ii in 1945 , they changed the [ emblem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:suomen_ilmavoimien_tunnus.svg ) and [ the mark on the planes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:finland_roundel_border.svg ) to what they still are , but some decorations and units still have the old black swastika . 
  the one i linked before is [ the flag of the pilot training school 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/training_air_wing,_finnish_air_force ) . 
  i do n't even properly know who golden dawn are , but my point is that the usage of swastikas does n't make everything immediately nazis . 
  do you think [ finnish air force ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lentosotakoulu.svg ) is full of nazis ? 
  or were ancient hindus also nazis ? 
  a lot of things in history and even nowadays have similar patterns as swastikas . 
  that still does n't make them nazis . 
  how did you come up with that conclusion ? 
  finland should add solar panels , but we also need to add other renewable solutions . 
  solar panels are great for summers but we need others for winter . 
  that map shows yearly sum , so a lot of that is produced in the summer when sun is shining in the middle of the night . 
  but in the winter when we need the most electricity , sun only shines couple hours and that is if it does n't snow or there is no clouds . 
  i 'm not sure but i think in germany the average winter temperatures are only something like 5c - -5 c if we just could store electricity efficiently , that would be great . 
  finland also has xvideos . 
  i live in western finland and when i go to countryside , people 's dialect seems more like that me\u00e4nkieli than literal finnish . 
  at least for that text which is in wikipedia . 
  d 's are often pronounced as t 's and ts 's are tt . 
  highest beer taxation with britain , but still 9th on the beer consumption per capita in the world \\ o / . 
  china does n't want to ruin its relations with eu too much , because eu is china 's biggest trading partner and china cares a lot about money . 
  us is probably second biggest trading partner so it would really be bad for china 's economy . 
  nokia networks is fourth largest telecommunication equipment manufacturer in the world , nokia also just made deal with samsung that its here maps will be exclusively on samsung 's tizen and android phones and it also has pretty active research center and a lot of patents . 
  so nokia does a lot more than just cell phones . 
  but super alko is n't there d :, 
  went to prisma to buy some putin-cheese last saturday . 
  everything had gone already :(, 
  may i ask why vice is so disliked ? 
  their reporting is a bit biased , but i think all the news are somehow biased so everything should be read and watched with some source criticism . 
  i do n't really watch anything other than the dispatches but those are n't that bad . 
  i would love to see frederik dancing between those girls and singing with them . 
   this is our prime minister , alexander stubb . 
  last i checked our prime minister is juha sipil\u00e4 . 
  it 's the website of the team that searches artefacts underwater and they found the submarine . 
  http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/frammande-ubat-hittad-i-svenskt-vatten/ here 's news and live-tv about the submarine , but it 's in swedish . 
  for nokia , it was probably great thing that microsoft bought its mobile division . 
  now nokia can grow again . 
  they already had problems when they choose to use windows phone and after that it just got worse . 
  finland had too many eggs in one basket so these kind of things were to happen eventually . 
  i also do n't understand the hate against microsoft . 
  it can not be a surprise that windows phone is n't doing as well as they have hoped so they have to downsize from somewhere . 
  so this laukaus is the laukaus from the laukaus gaming forums ? 
  that 's weird because the finnish forest association reports :  for all tree species and all forestry areas of finland , the annual growth is greater than annual removals . 
  yes . 
  even prince daniel has some forest finn ancentry , but i do n't think anyone thinks him as a finn . 
  his father even is some kind of leader in the forest finn community . 
  i read just now some news that public is asking the prime minister to resign ? 
  true . 
  i did n't how to explain that they made a ` uudissana ' , so ` mixing words ' is probably the wrong way of saying it . 
  the finnish word ` p\u00e4\u00e4si\u00e4inen ' comes from mixing words ` p\u00e4\u00e4st\u00e4 paastosta ' ( getting out of fasting ) . 
  finnish priests did n't want to derivate the word from latin ` pascha ' , as it 's too similar to ` paska ' , which means shit in finnish . 
  d : did n't know that it 's exactly the same . 
  now i know how to swear in estonian \\ o /, 
  is there an equivalent of ` vittu ' in estonia ? ` so , when i go to estonia , how can i say something similar to ` voi vittujen vittu ' ? 
  what do you say when you are angry ? 
  you can say the same thing in finnish using `` joo '' . 
  `` joo , en oo menossa '' ( same example as yours was , but in finnish ), 
  an inventor invented a cookie . 
  after inventing a cookie the inventor invented that the cookie was already invented .

  maybe this is the one ? 
  funnily enough , there is way more people with `` ruotsalainen '' ( swedish ) as a lastname than `` suomalainen '' ( finnish ) . 
  finland is happier than sweden and netherlands . 
  good day to be happy .

  many non-eu investment banks might consider moving their offices from london to dublin or luxembourg . 
  also hsbc already have said that they will keep the headquarters in london , but will move 1000 of it 's investment banking employees to paris .

  there was a `` theme day '' in october when yle ( finland 's national public-broadcasting company ) suddenly [ released 55 news articles ] ( http://keskustelu.suomi24.fi/t/13919130/ylen-uusi-propaganda ! ), 
  about positive things and how to help refugees . 
  that was also the same time as the most refugees was coming from sweden to finland . 
  even other news sites started to make news about how yle reports that moomins love everyone else but not racists . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/kotimaa/muumi%20rapu%20yle-42829 ) article also cites some other titles from yle like `` jesus , moomins and moses are all refugees '' , `` from somalia , with love '' , `` old testament is just one refugee description '', 
  [ great athletes get hot wives ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j2zk75l.jpg ), 
  what the hell happened in finland and baltics d : usually at least finland and estonia have pretty similar words , but this time the words are totally different . 
  nice rt.com article again . 
   the country due to perceived increased military activity by russia , according to the air force command finland . 
  could n't find any other page that says the same thing . 
  there was some interviews from kanerva about why this excercise had been planned in secret , but again i could n't find anything where he says that this is happening because of increased russian activity . 
  i 'm not saying that they ca n't speculate that this is happening because of that , but rt just seems to be really bad news site for these kind of things .

  oulu is nowadays bigger than turku . 
  so we are the heir to the roman empire and mongolian empire ? 
  we better start conquering shit . 
  good start would be with sweden . 
  for such an educated man , you have pretty twisted view on what slave camp is . 
  http://www.mil.ee/en/defence-forces/compulsory-military-service sounds pretty similar to finnish conscription , except that the minimum time is two months longer . 
   germany yeah germany has ` huge ' border with russia , wtf : dd . 
  and they are also in nato . 
  estonia has the same kind of conscription as finland and they went to nato as soon as it was possible for them . 
  maybe not . 
  we are not in nato so nothing quarentees that for example usa must help us if we are under invasion .
