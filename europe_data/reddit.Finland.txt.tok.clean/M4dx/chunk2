  that 's what we have to deal with by being next to russia , but saying that cooperating on defence with sweden is meaningless , is just not true . 
  war nowadays would n't be like the 1939-1945 wars . 
  now we ca n't just make big line of defence to the border and try to hold that . 
  that kind of war would be total hell and destruction for the whole country . 
   the swedish military can not offer us substantial assistance ( they may not even be able to defend all of their own territory ) , hence such cooperation is meaningless for us . 
  swedish army has the same amount or more modern armoured vehicles than finnish army . 
  they have more aircrafts than finnish air force has . 
  the reason they might not be able to defend themselves is because they do n't have the manpower to quickly defend their country . 
  if an armed conflict begins in finland , sweden can easily help with providing equipment , which for finland is very important as we have the bigger manpower ( because of conscription ) . 
  finland 's food prices are one of the highest in europe , but not the highest .

  i think they also made some kind of unofficial political deal with the us when finland decided to buy the hornets . 
  we have a lake called persej\u00e4rvi ( asslake ) , but we also have couple of shitlakes ( paskaj\u00e4rvi ) .

  i do n't know if belgium has municipal tax rate , but in finland in addition to normal income tax rate , you pay municipal income taxes and also some other very small taxes . 
  so if you have 90000 $ income , you pay something like 53 % taxes .

  some refugees also complained that it 's too cold and then decided to go back to iraq . 
  the communist countries had the ussr 's molotov plan , which was ussr 's version of the marshal plan . 
  finland declined the marshal plan because of finlandization and also the molotov plan did n't include finland because it was only for countries politically and economically aligned to the soviet union . 
  this also started already in august . 
  the metropolia university of applied sciences is the coordinater of the project so the video is probably just an ad to show what they are doing . 
  pe classes when there 's no snow a ) pes\u00e4pallo, 
  you are on my list now . 
  finland has 300,000 - 400,000 rifles that are same ones that conscripts use in service . 
  also during 1990s finland bought a lot of chinese and east german made aks for reserve troops and most of those are in storage . 
  professional soldiers in nordic countries at least are trained for a bit different situations than normal conscription armies . 
  sweden 's professional soldiers have started to some extend participate in some of the finland 's exercises , because our bigger exercises have couple thousand soldiers , but sweden ca n't have that kind of exercises with the army size they have . 
  and when finland participates in a joint exercises abroad , it will still usually send reservists there to participate ( and they have done quite well , for example last winter 's cold response 2016 ) . 
  in bigger battles ( like a full-scale invasion ) there 's bigger advantage if you have that cannon fodder , than if you do n't have it . 
  strong leadership is more important and those are professional soldiers . 
  also that works as a protection in peace time . 
  russia knows that finland can mobilize at least 200 000 reservists that know the basic things , it will consider at least twice before doing anything . 
  this is probably the reason why sweden also considers conscription . 
  random dude who does n't contribute anything to the conversation spotted . 
  it was one of the reasons , but at that time the border was way closer to st. petersburg than it is now . 
  the reasons for winter war were also way more complicated than just protecting st. petersburg . 
  true , but finland ca n't really afford to get bigger ones as they are way more expensive and we ca n't really go to russia and say that they are not allowed to get bigger aa systems because we do n't have the budget for similar kind of systems . 
  yes , and finland has had anti-aircraft missile systems since the 90s and couple of years ago we bought nasams ii systems to replace the old buk m1 systems . 
  of course , those are a bit smaller than s-400 systems , but that 's just because we ca n't afford bigger ones . 
  sure , these can be effective and versatile , but you could say that about most of the war machines . 
  i just get annoyed from these articles that try to spread fear that suddenly russia would invade finland , even though they are just placing anti-air missiles . 
  yeah , that 's why it 's a bit stupid to think that they are doing this because of finland . 
  in a case of war , our hornets would n't even go that far . 
  there 's not really anything interesting about this . 
  russia does a lot of weird shit , but this is not one of those things even though the article tries to imply that this happened because finland is moving closer to nato . 
  s-400 missiles are mostly for defence purposes and what is in leningrad region ? 
  st. petersburg , the second biggest city in russia . 
  that 's why the minister of defence also said that this was predictable and nothing new . 
  you betrayed your country,

  yeah , light beer is n't really what ` kalja ' ( or ` kotikalja ' , which is the more used name nowadays ) means , but could n't really find a better name for it . 
  kvass seems to be a similar drink . 
  in finnish , ` kalja ' is also used everywhere when talked about beer , even though the original meaning for ` kalja ' is similar to light beer . 
  fun fact : the most popular chewing gum brand in finland is also called `` jenkki '' . 
  it was introduced in 1951 and us soldiers were known to have chewing gum during the wwii . 
  also at one point the most popular chewing gum was liquorice flavored chewing gum called `` neekeri jenkki '' ( negro yankee ) .

  wtf is that survey ? 
  i put `` i am responding as : an individual in my personal capacity '' and then it asks ten must answer questions about my business . 
  that 's kinda stupid title for a news article . 
  what else they should practice for ? 
  for example , if finnish defence forces would stop practicing for war , then i do n't really see the point of having defence forces . 
  he is quite good president and popular with people . 
  he is quite normal man even though he is the president . 
  for example , [ this was his morning after he had won the presidential elections ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b5trioy.jpg ) and last year he just randomly called to some radio show to ask about some flower her wife had found . 
  but he is also not afraid to what he thinks . 
  he knows and gets along with most of the leaders , which is way more important than looking good for the cameras . 
  finnish president does n't have a lot of real power , so the most important thing for him is to establish connections .

  it was tusk who declined to meet her . 
  do n't know about the others , but i have noticed that the finnish greens party 's reputation has kinda started to shift from being just an environment party to being more of an overall liberal party , but which also still has lot of values from the social democratic side . 
  they have started to concentrate a lot more on all issues in society , rather than just the environmental issues . 
  most of their supporters are young and usually have a higher education , so maybe similar things are happening in other countries . 
  the finns party already lost a lot of their supporters . 
  they got something like 18 % of the votes in the last elections , but now according to polls , their support is somewhere 9-10 % . 
  in the next elections the centre party , social democrats and national coalition will probably fight for the top spot , but the biggest surprise might come from the greens party which is very pro-eu . 
  they have been gaining a lot of support and the recent polls are showing that their support is bigger than it has ever been , 13.6 % . 
  tl ; dr i do n't really see eu membership referendum happening in finland . 
  by having their offices in london , they can sell finance services to the whole eu .

  most of the parties are saying that only a referendum could decide the joining , which is not new . 
  only bigger party that is supporting nato is kokoomus and they have been doing that for years , so i do n't really see your point about ` how government is pushing for joining nato ' .
