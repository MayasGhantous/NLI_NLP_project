  i just ca n't see why this is such a problem . 
  it 's like people want our defence forces to just stay alone and never try to learn something from others . 
  you ca n't learn how to fight by just thinking what we should do . 
  experience is extremely important part and which country is probably the most experienced country currently ? 
  usa . 
  of course usa wants us to have a close cooperation with us because in the northern europe we are kind of a important factor , but that 's just good for us because our forces get to train with them more . 
  it ca n't be a surprise to anyone that finnish defence forces just concentrate how to defence against russia . 
  maybe we should just go back to 60s-70s and buy half of our stuff from where we want and then rest from russia because we have to . 
  i 'm not slavic , but i still just wrote what i think about the pan-slavism idea , even though it was n't asked from non-slavs . 
  it sounds like a very difficult idea to implement and i think it would just produce more problems than it would solve . 
  you can probably go to any store or ice cream stand here and find black licorice ice cream  . 
  someone should make terva leijona ice cream . 
  tar and licorice together . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m9pl29b4ds i do n't really care if someone i meet is slavic and i do n't know why i should care much about that . 
  pan-slavism sounds like a stupid idea and would probably never work . 
  black licorice ice cream is probably one of the most popular ice creams in finland . 
  they 're similar games , but still quite different .

  it shows that the spirits consumption has never been as high as 9.16 and nowadays is less than 5 ( the data ends in 2010 , but i do n't think the consumption has risen after that ) .

  those widened roads allow military aircrafts to land and take off there , so they can be used as temporary airbases during wartime . 
  what 's the point of war if it 's limited to field battles ? 
  it will end up in cities , because those are something are supposed to be protected by your drones . 
  your drones ca n't totally stop the movement of the enemy 's troops and at some point they will end up in your cities . 
  this is pointless because you do n't explain what kind of drones you are talking about as they are not uavs . 
  you did n't answer what kind of drones . 
  it 's kinda pointless to try to guess what kind of imagination drones you have . 
   if the drones are located sparsely , then the other drones outside the aiming coordinates will be able to shoot it down . 
  anti-air missiles are dropping the other drones , while those are shooting others and because you said your drones are mostly static in air , even manpads are dropping them . 
  then f-16s show up and drop some more drones and the drones ca n't catch them as they are way slower . 
  so , now your drones are dropping like flies and the enemy 's troops are continuing their way towards your cities . 
   i do n't get it , why would they need ground troops ? 
  because otherwise the enemy would just walk through , shoot down some of your drones and then be in your cities . 
  so describe exactly what kind of drones you are talking about . 
  drones that are yet to be developed then ? 
  that are in your imaginations ? 
  uavs are mostly the only drones that are in military use . 
   but the anti air systems are more cumbersome and require a lot of resources . 
  also read my previous argument . 
  and drones are n't resource heavy then ? 
  what previous argument ? 
  does your drones also dodge [ these ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1m4sxoli8&amp;user=asease1234 )  who said that ? 
  i said that . 
  drones are used as surveillance already , but currently they ca n't be used alone without ground troops advancing or they can only be used to kill specific targets . 
  i do n't really see your point though . 
  you are saying that only drones should be used , but they only shoot small amount of ammunition ? 
  you realize that in a full scale war there is hundreds of thousands of soldiers which are all coming at you . 
  if you kill 100 commanders , there will be 100 more . 
  if you waste a week or two because of trying to find certain persons , you will lose the war . 
   there is not just one drone but multiple of them . 
  plus drones are small and thus harder to hit . 
  speed is important here . 
  anti-air missiles are extremely fast guided missiles . 
  those missiles are also cheaper than those drones that get hit , which makes them very viable to use . 
   only one person is required to control a swarm of drones , where they are all programmed to hit certain targets or anything that resembles human . 
  again , something that is not used . 
  there could also be anti-air systems that shoot automatically all the drones if we are going for that kind of speculative arguments . 
   i think the first step is to use smaller drones as surveillance , or to locate and kill a certain person that 's what they are used already , but you still need boots on the ground to actually have a chance to win . 
  current drones are slow compared to current fighter aircrafts , so those can be used . 
  signal jamming can be used to jam their communication with the other drones and the base they are from . 
  if the drones are small , what are they gon na carry then ? 
  couple of missiles wo n't do much damage against full scale army and really small drones ca n't even carry that . 
  the missiles also have a range limit , so the drones ca n't really shoot from the higher altitudes they can fly . 
  the modern anti-air missile systems can shoot up to about 8km altitudes , so to survive the drones would have to go higher than that , but for example the range of hellfire missiles is also 8km , so that would be kind of a problem . 
   not only that but drones can communicate with other drones to shoot specific targets faster than humans . 
  that 's possible , but for now none of the military forces of the world has used that kind of system . 
  drones are also still controlled by humans . 
  of course drones will develop and at some point it will be feasible to use only drones , but that time is not yet . 
  drones are expensive and easily taken out if the enemy knows that you are only using drones . 
   but i do n't think troops nowadays are that much concentrated for non-nuclear weapons of mass destruction to be effective . 
  they are still effective . 
  that kind of shelling can easily take out a big part of a company . 
  against land troops artillery is the one which usually produces the most damage . 
  it causes chaos and if used correctly , can cause big casualties and they are not expected to be mass destruction , they are expected to be used in every battle supporting the other land troops that are closer . 
  artillery is extremely cheap compared to other bombing methods . 
  but finland only prepares for a war against russia and finland would never get air superiority . 
  also drones are useful at destroying specific targets , not really good against when there 's huge amount of troops coming . 
  these are supposed to be used like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dso52hn8gxq both drones and howitzers are good and they are used for different reasons . 
  for now , drones just ca n't replace old kind of artillery .
