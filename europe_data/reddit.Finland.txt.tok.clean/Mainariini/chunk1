stop looking at things from 21st century perspective imho it 'd be more important that you guys realized that it * is * the 21st century now and * started * looking from that perspective . 
  it 's 2014 and you still think that annexing parts of other countries because of the ethnicity of people living in the area is okay . 
  you also * still * talk about `` spheres of influence '' and refer to other countries as `` your backyard '' instead of the homes of their citizens . 
  your country 's biggest annual celebration is the one where you announce that you were the ultimate good in ww2 . 
  you seem to think that this alone is enough of a reason for you to receive nothing but gratitude from the rest of europe , and get pissed if that is not the case . 
  all the people who were against you are automatically `` fascists '' . 
  you seem to see fascists everywhere these days , and assume that the west ( / nato ) is planning to attack russia . 
  to me , it all seems like you have not realized that ww2 ended decades ago and it is the 21st century now . 
  and then you go on explaining how molotov-ribbentrop was an awesome policy . 
  molotov-ribbentrop pact put the russians and the germans above all the other peoples . 
  it diminished the citizens of the countries between them to being nothing else but human shields and completely ignored their rights . 
  according to it you had the right for `` pre-emptive attacks '' on third parties , invading their countries and killing their people , just because you were afraid that someone * might * do the same to you . 
  additionally , i do n't believe for a second that the ussr was not planning on building an empire just as much as germany was . 
  apparently even 70 years after that , russians , starting from the president , consider this a rightful and reasonably policy . 
  and then you blame others for `` russophobia '', 
  or other countries and people neighboring russia . 
  an awesome way of showing how the russians `` did n't want to fight '' . 
  well , do you have any better suggestions ? 
  what should the west try to do then ? 
  : / it 's not like i 'm too happy about the ruble plummeting as it affects our economy too + there are people in russia that i genuinely care about , but i do n't really know how else the west could try to affect rufed 's policies than economically . 
  ours kinda is . 
  time for vodka ? 
  and the correct reaction to this akakabuto roaming free is to try to please it in hope that it wo n't hurt you , while it mauls others in the neighborhood and roars at everyone that happens to get close ? 
  it 's nice to see that estoniazation is not a thing . 
  `` the land of sweden gave to its children a beautiful king who 's actually a nobody '' - a finnish children 's song haha , let 's see about that once you 've re-established the kalmar union . 
   we actually look at finland as a big brother and a beacon of our future i chuckled . 
  loudly . 
  finland 's got loads of problems , bureaucracy and taxation among the main ones . 
  :p i guess in this respect we should take a leaf out of your book . 
  maybe we should move from the little brother / big brother positions to just being `` brothers '' ? 
  if it makes you feel any better , i have no idea who the president of iceland is either ... 
  the king of norway was in the media around the breivik case so him i know . 
  :d whereas when it comes to the swedish royal family it seems like our media has decided to use them to compensate our lack of royality . 
  newspaper headlines expect you to know who `` madde '' is . 
   margrethe the first was the one that actually united scandinavia with the kalmar union this i knew !, 
  it was in our fifth grade history book :d, 
  i did n't even know you guys had a queen . 
  i checked wikipedia and she does indeed seem to be more badass than good ol' kalle kustaa . 
  that does n't require very much though . 
  hmm , there 're no bridges from finland to the neighboring countries over the sea so i guess they 'll just all end up in the sea . 
  unless they find their boats . 
  * denmark * `` protecting '' the swedish minority ? 
  the gallup did n't include the swedish people 's party :d, 
  [ they do n't ? 
  funny , it 's the same with finnish dairy products :p, 
  oh you have these `` russian children 's rights are not being respected '' cases too ? 
   maybe stalin , like every one else in human history , is a bit more multifacetted than the bad guys from the comic books . 
  yet the same can not be the case when it comes to people who [ collaborated with nazis ] ( http://en.ria.ru/politics/20141025/194554839/russian-parliament-bans-symbols-of-nazi-collaborator.html ) ? 
  they were all just purely evil ? 
   fascist-gay-nazi traitors welcome to the club :3 outside of russia 's borders we 're russophobes instead of traitors though . 
  [ exactly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyromitra_esculenta ) :3, 
  oh , this is something we do n't do :d i need to try this someday !, 
  i [ explained ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kla4u/what_do_you_like_about_russiarussians/cln9a0g ) this in another comment :d apparently even our fellow nordics do n't value these mushrooms , it seems there are n't even wikipedia articles about them in norwegian/danish and the swedes seem to call these kinds of mushrooms `` finska riskor '' :p, 
  i do n't know how others eat mushrooms . 
  :d it 's just that the mushrooms mentioned in the wikipedia article ( one of the species i pick the most ) are often not considered edible in western sources , and the reasons are like : `` symptoms that are typically experienced after consuming raw mushrooms include nausea , vomiting , and severe diarrhea that starts about one hour after ingestion . '', 
  and `` the intensely peppery taste of the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess '' and after those they say that `` despite these reports of toxicity '' these mushrooms are eaten in finland and russia . 
  ... which is because we do n't eat them raw ;p, 
  haha :d beautiful = / = readable, 
  [ swan lake ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbye4qdv9zw ) has been one of my favourite pieces since i was very small . 
  i used to ask my dad to play it so that i could `` swim '' to it on the floor . 
  'cause swans swim instead of dancing . 
  he 's cute . 
  the programm itself is n't too popular in finland , but most people know at least gena 's birthday song . 
  * matroshka dolls . 
  damn i had an obsession of getting all the bottoms match the tops exactly , without splitting the pictures . 
  my brother claimed that it does n't matter if the inner ones are okay as people only see the biggest one , but he was wrong . 
  * being one of the few people 's on this earth to have [ enough common sense ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactarius_torminosus#edibility_and_toxicity ) to realize that there are other ways of eating mushrooms than raw . 
  healthy love for picking mushrooms in general . 
  :d * i still kind of like the language and the weird alphabet . 
  i tried to learn them at school but it did n't go that well ... also , russian handwriting is often really beautiful . 
  probably many others , but these come to mind first . 
  it 's a pity things have to be like this and the relationship between russia and the west so bad . 
  well , as i [ already said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ka6lc/norway_and_russia_celebrate_70year_anniversary_of/clk3qrk ) , the historical relationship between finland and russia is very different from that between russia and norway . 
  you definitely could n't say we had always been `` neutral or friends '' it 's not like finland 's looking forward to getting into conflicts here . 
  we have so much border with russia that in a conflict between the west and russia we 're among the ones that suffer the most . 
  but this proximity to russia also makes russian 's expansion plans ( in actual landmass or `` sphere of influence '' ) a bigger threat to us than to most other western countries . 
  i do n't know if the current sanctions will help the situation or just make it worse , but do you have any better ideas ? 
  : / the fact that norway does n't get picked at is something i 've also realized and am kind of jealous of . 
  you managed to be the only nato country sharing a border with russia during the whole cold war , respect to you for that . 
  for us , even talking about membership results in [ threats ] ( http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2014/10/21/om-finland-gar-med-i-nato-blir-ni-var-fiende ) . 
  i do n't know if it 's because our border with russia is longer or because for some shitty historical reason they think they should have more control over us or whatnot , but i do n't like it at all . 
  anyways , i see where you 're coming from but to me it sounds very much like the policy we had towards the soviet union for decades , aka [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) . 
  which is something i 'd rather not see again . 
  i guess our countries ' historical relationships with russia are just very different . 
  like , finland 's memories of soviet soldiers from the days of ww2 are very far from `` liberators . '', 
  :p finland was also on the western side of the iron curtain during the cold war , but far less firmly than norway . 
  and while until the russian revolution you had pomor trade , we had the `` privilege '' of being a part of russia . 
  also , while there 's never been a war between norway and russia , finland 's case is more like `` there have been few wars against countries other than russia '' ( even if counting the wars the people fought prior independence ) :p we have four neighbours and of those we 've only ever been at war with the eastern one . 
  ( unless you count peasant rebellions against the swedish overlords , haha ), 
  is this a common sentiment towards russia in norway ? 
  that norway and russia are good neighbours that have always lived in peace ? 
  russian media claims that norway joined the sanctions against russia simply [ because of outside pressure ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/756521 ) , is there any truth behind this claim ? 
  to get the swedes spend even more time and money in their submarine search so that they can use it internally as a proof of the [ russophobia of the west ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/world/755888 ) ? 
  `` quantity has a quality all its own '', 
   no , what you think we are ? 
  literally hitler ? 
  no , sorry , i put it badly . 
  what i meant is that does a person 's `` russianness '' depend on the ethnicity of their parents ? 
  are children of russians automatically russian even if they never learn the language and can a non-russian become one if they learn the language when they are very young ? 
  i know you guys have an ethnicity listing of a sort , a bit like ` murica , and it confuses me a bit .
