  so ... you think you guys just ca n't have a `` regional internet culture '' without us ? 
  such touching words , danskj\u00e4vel . 
  not donald duck ? 
  and you think e.g. 
  pike no bitey ? 
  people always forget about iceland :(, 
  maybe when he talks about `` foreign people '' he thinks about russians ? 
  '' \u00e4 '' , '' \u00f6 '' and `` ng '' are all rather difficult to them , even though the sounds do exist in english . 
   - finland has reclaimed karelia and quite a lot of extra land . 
  `` te '' means `` you '' ( in plural ) in finnish . 
  `` tee ! '', 
  mean `` do ! '', 
  ( imperative form ) in finnish . 
  [ this dude does ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-daawu3gtk ) , 
  you have a saami flair . 
  can you give us some examples of popular saami names ? 
  or do you just usually use the same names as the rest of the population ? 
  it says * language families * , not `` racial groups '' . 
  because they do n't want to join nato at all or because they do n't want to do that without us ? 
  sweden 's doing defence stuff without us . 
  me too . 
  as another * totally * independent outsider . 
  no bias whatsoever . 
   why the hell not ? 
  op has been seen many times claiming how latvia is n't really that different from the nordics in the sense that people are n't that keen on letting their emotions show to the public . 
  rejoicing sounds rather emotional to me . 
  rejoicing latvians ? 
  pics or it did n't happen  happy independence day anyway !, 
   too far east to be called western and northern i live further east than any part of latvia , but i 've still been called both of those ;p, 
  when that day comes , shall we also block the border and build a wall on it ? 
  burgerland 's dna testing services [ seem to agree with you two ] ( http://blogs.ancestry.com/techroots/ancestrydna-did-you-know/ ) :p, 
  oh you , always so cheery . 
  i , on the other hand , feel the opposite . 
  so i guess it varies between europeans . 
  uralic = / = asian, 
  oh , i already wondered where you guys disappeared . 
  england and france ? 
  :d plus you dare to mention svenneland before the country you belong to . 
  :'( your island has been demilitarized several times during the history . 
  which contract is valid atm ? 
  in comparison to the military might of \u00c5land ? 
  would you have no problem with calling you latvians or calling estonians finns ? 
   if estonia into nordic , we 're coming along you guys may , you are overall friendly and culturally close to us . 
  lithuania may not , it 's one of those states that are pretty much just confused parts of russia . 
  [ proof .

  hmh ? 
  at times in a very literal sense . 
  finnish-norwegian border on the [ finnish side ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@68.663986,23.320642,3a,75y,191.05h,76.49t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sgbdwmazugeh_51qxpq8zlq!2e0 ) and on the [ norwegian side ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@68.665521,23.320913,3a,75y,0.59h,81.45t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sfuonmhzi7p-dpjuqsftzoa!2e0 ) . 
  estonia of course . 
  finnic people are awesome . 
   danish iceland ? 
  so , possibly living in the country but not native to it . 
  judging by your finnish language skills in [ this message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xs6kx/estonian_ministry_of_defense_rules/cp3xl9y ) , you 're not really finnish . 
  could you please stop pretending to represent us ? 
  your finnish/estonian makes more sense than that of u/didijustobama . 
   our media is controlled by a large part of our northern ( or should i say western ? ), 
  partners . 
  could you elaborate this ? 
  you even have some experience of [ glorious nordic leadership ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_casimir_ehrnrooth ) . 
  lost brothers ? 
  \u266a our boys lie buried in the sand of the balkan \u266b \u266b on the other side of the danube \u266a, 
  i guess that 's possible . 
  if the term `` scandinavia '' is derived from `` scania '' , which was a part of denmark back then , it would be odd if it did n't include the danes . 
  :d i have n't given that any thought either ... that sounds like one of those `` what if '' dilemmas . 
  :d anyway , in the reality we live in , finland 's not scandinavian , and i 'm completely fine with that . 
  i 'll compensate with mah glorious finno-ugricness , all while still being 100 % nordic . 
  i 'd claim that it 's the linguistic division that affects this the most , but yeah , you do have a point that it 's kind of dumb to appeal to geography if you include denmark . 
  nice to hear from a dane , as you 're pretty much the nordic country we have the least in common with . 
  well , geography is also a part of it . 
  what 's wrong with geographical divisions ? 
  edit . 
  [ do n't you dare to forget this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/estonian-nordic-cross-flag.jpg ), 
  [ now you just ordered a thousand litres of milk .

  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  you know , it is completely possible to be of different ethnicities without one being `` better '' than the other . 
  being scandinavian kind of includes being northern germanic , but it does n't mean that being finno-ugric would be worse . 
  it 's just different . 
  ... denmark * is * scandinavian , finland is n't . 
  who cares ? 
  being nordic is enough for me , i have no need to be regarded as a `` scandinavian '' . 
  it 's not like that would make us any `` better '' . 
  you have been banned from there ? 
  i 'm assuming we live in russian time now . 
  have you tried pirkka beer ? 
  i thought it was the russian empire . 
  i 'm actually not sure . 
  maybe because in russian they 're considered single sounds ( / t\u0361s / and / t\u0361\u0255 / ) , classifying them as s sounds just seemed like the easiest solution . 
  in comparison , in finnish / ts / is a combination of two sounds , which pretty much always are parts of different syllables . 
  for example in * ruotsi * the syllables are * ruot * and * si * . 
  or maybe somebody just thought that `` russian has seven s sounds '' sounded cool and now it 's repeated in every russian textbook to pass the information further . 
   make me think there 's no distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants in finnish there is n't really . 
  not in native finnish words anyway . 
  the distinction is made in some recent loanwords , e.g. 
  bussi ( bus ) vs. pussi ( bag ) . 
  the letter d is used in some native finnish words but that 's an exception . 
  originally , it stood for another sound , but due to swedish influence , people thought it was supposed to be pronounced like / d / . 
  but yeah , for example to my grandfather , b/p and g/k are exactly the same sounds . 
  and it 's the same for s/sh , no difference heard between those .
