you might not believe it but there are a some serious market forces revolving around immigration . 
  someone is building the shelters or providing aid , materials and manpower to them . 
  manufacturers and agriculture also benefit from importing unskilled menial labor to undercut european wages . 
  also , not everyone thinks in egoistic or utilitarian way of `` what do i gain '' . 
  i 'd imagine that this is more common in southern europe , where societies are more communal than in north and west . 
  when `` lex nokia '' was presented back in 2009 , it was widely suspected that it was a product of a lobbying of several tech corporations , including nokia . 
  the law was supposed to grant employers right to read their employees personal communications under certain conditions and evil tongues claim that representatives of nokia threatened pm 's by moving their hq and r&d out of finland , if the law would n't pass ( ironic , considering their recent developments ) . 
  the law passed , but it was saddled with so much restrictions that it was only been evoked few times during it 's lifespan . 
  oh yes , the nato-talks . 
  annual event in which we ponder and debate ceaselessly over pros and cons of nato membership , our leaders have some inspiring but ultimately fruitless talks with sweden and either russia sends threats or someone threatens with russia . 
  then someone somewhere decides to drop the issue , the discussion slowly fades away and people return to drinking their depression away . 
  come now , we had n't anything against rest of the allies , only the soviet union , who invaded us and stole our lands . 
  germans just happened to conveniently declare war on them , so we thought that we might as well push our claims for reconquest . 
  well now , it was n't a shithole , just a bit undeveloped . 
  now it 's ... well , less undeveloped . 
  you are right , i should add communist , slav , gay , disabled or a vocal proponent of democratic elections to that statement . 
  the point of my comment was to exclaim why nazis were more favorable option compared to the soviets for the majority of population . 
   i thought that finland was allied with germany anyway during that period ? 
  on a technical level , finland was a co-belligerent against the soviet union with germany , as we never signed an alliance . 
  we gave them a right to use our soil in their invasion in return of some better equipment and military support . 
  there also was a ss-unit comprised of finnish volunteers . 
   what is the significance of fighting in finnish uniforms rather than german ? 
  the significance , if there was any could had been the difference between the german [ operation barbarossa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) and the [ finnish continuation war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) , which were technically two separate wars . 
  finns were reclaiming their lands lost in [ the winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_peace_treaty ) with [ a grand plan of unite finnic areas in soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_finland ) , whereas operation barbarossa was just an usual nazi war of conquest , lacking any meaningful territorial rights . 
  some estonians might had seen our war as more `` just '' . 
  also we are sort of a brother nations , so that might had played a part . 
  as for the plane with swastika , that actually is ( or at least was ) the logo of our air forces , which predates nazis . 
  [ it 's still in use as the logo of finnish air force academy . 
  ] ( http://cdn.ksml.fi/incoming/xtaerr-5380529.jpg/alternates/free_1140/5380529.jpg ), 
  also known as lead poisoning . 
  well , churchill sent mannerheim a box of cigars as a apology , at least . 
  well , at least you guys did n't declare war on us like the brits did . 
  they burned half of lapland on their way out . 
  it will , but then we , the rest of europe , can just wash our hands about them , like we did/are doing with turkey and russia . 
  eu regulation has thus far been rather customer oriented regarding information trafficking and laws on intellectual property , so we might see some progress on broadcasting matters in few decades . 
  right now they are working on banning roaming fees afaik . 
  let 's put it like this : his mandate comes from the european prime ministers , whose mandate comes from their parties ( at least in here ) , whose mandate comes from their voters . 
  if juncker does something stupid , the people can choose to not elect people who elected the people who elected him . 
  if political opponents of juncker get elected to prime ministers , they ( afaik ) can elect someone other than him . 
  so , it 's true that he is n't responsible to the people , but to people who are responsible for the people . 
  then again , only the prime minister is actually elected in my country . 
  today we learn briefly about it in secondary school , then more in depth if one chooses to go to upper secondary school and then even more in depth if one chooses `` the eu-course '' in society studies , also in upper secondary . 
  after that if one chooses to study any international or law related field , like i currently do , you will learn some basics of the eu laws . 
  i have only just finished my upper secondary so i ca n't really say how it was done before my time . 
  they ca n't , during the soviet times that got you in gulag . 
  when i saw the word `` brawl '' i was hoping for something like [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emkiiv2_cni ) so disappointing . 
  long story short , there are two large scale retail franchises who have hypermarkets in finland , kesko and s-group . 
  prisma is s-group 's hypermarket franchise and as far as i know it 's thought as equal to kesko 's k-citymarket . 
  hmm , hymm , humm or \u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 are what i have encountered in finland . 
  ca n't the pope just attend to the spiritual matters and pray by himself in his city state instead spreading false hope and possible seeds of insubordination among the refugees ? 
  huh til ... 
   who are the protecting us from ? 
  if i recall correctly , there was a one east-slavic country that conquered the eastern part of your country and made it a puppet state for 50 years . 
  i think it was russie or something like that . 
  well , now that you mentioned it , who would n't want to be part of a country , that : * has an oligarchic dictatorship * has times worse quality of living * has once tried to eradicate your culture and language * has invaded your country and stolen 11 % of it 's land area and made 12 % of it 's population homeless * host regular military drills near your country 's borders and frequently violates it 's airspace * [ has a president stating that your country 's independence was a mistake ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-wants-to-regain-finland-for-russia-adviser-says-9224273.html ), 
  finally someone gets it !, 
  that is it ? 
  i thought it was something along the lines '' \u00f6rst\u00e5ckap\u00f6b\u00f6rkb\u00f6rk '', 
  funnily enough , it might even decrease population growth . 
  now that all manner of sexual pleasures are within `` hand 's reach '' , some people might be content with that and not bother seeking the real thing . 
  that coupled with modern pills and condoms and voila , no more accidental pregnancies . 
  [ porilainen ] ( http://www.xn--kfte-5qa.fi/images/porilainen.jpg ) is rather popular in my town . 
  basically a big slice of sausage of some sort between buns with mayonnaise and spices . 
  for finnish historical films , best bet would be [ the unknown soldier ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-unknown-soldier-region-2/dp/b000v25ue8 ) , although it does n't contain historical characters but rather tells about the continuation war from common soldiers ' perspective . 
  there is also [ the girl king ] ( http://www.amazon.com/girl-king-malin-buska/dp/b0194bjcek/ref=tmm_aiv_title_1?_encoding=utf8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr= ) which is a finnish film , but it technically tells about swedish history . 
  in the same vein belongs [ the fencer ] ( http://thefencermovie.com/ ) that might offer some insight on life in soviet estonia . 
  i had to study swedish for six years and i do n't know how you say `` sorry '' in swedish . 
  so , they willingly broke norwegian law and even admitted that to the interviewer , while crying that barnevernet intervened ? 
  is n't that rather self-contradictory ? 
  also :  `` but the law in norway , it is very clear until the smallest detail , it 's not allowed of any physical correction , and we have never been aware that it was this strict . '', 
  do n't know about cats , but according to wikipedia most popular dog breeds in finland are the generic german shepherd , labrador retriever and golden retriever . 
  as for association , we do have some native breeds such as [ finnish spitz ] ( http://www.tunturisusi.com/koiralinkit/suomenpystykorva.jpg ) , [ finnish hound ] ( https://asiakas.kotisivukone.com/files/ruskapolunkennel.kotisivukone.com/19.06.09_mira_1.jpg ) , which is also the most popular finnish breed , and [ lapponian herder ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/b0/39/c8/b039c83002d0b93cff7c70376f88974f.jpg ) . 
  mostly pets , although some breeds are used in hunting and possibly reindeer herding . 
  well , they did find a medieval coin stash from church grounds in my hometown 12 years ago so i guess everything is still possible . 
  probably not soon , since nowadays you ca n't even utter the letter `` e '' without someone crying `` evil eurocrats from brussels are coming to steal muh sovereignty ^ tm '' . 
  edit : grammar, 
  pretty good out of 329k , i dare say . 
  damn i should had visited russia !, 
  now russia has visited this subreddit . 
  finnish over everything . 
  officially swedish ( only applies in \u00c5land , ostrobothnia and capital region maybe . ), 
  english , if the job has anything to do with tourism or is in an area where a lot of foreigners visit , such as airports . 
  not as necessary as others : russian , if in vicinity of border or a tourist attraction . 
  what , no danish ? 
  i thought that you scandies understood eachothers :p, 
  it 's also funny that , at least according to bertrand russell germany was on verge of becoming the most social liberal country in europe , but then the war came and rest is history . 
  ww1 is certainly interesting on `` what if '' scale . 
  are you perchance implying that there are no lazy bums in usa ? 
  was n't the 2nd amendment made during a period when all fire armas were single-shot muskets ? 
  whereas nowadays firepower of a village militia fits in a single holster . 
  i doubt the founding fathers foresaw that one day a single person could massacre a classroom full of kids with just one gun . 
  it would n't fly since with brexit and rise of eurosceptism in general not that many will support giving more centralized authority to the eu . 
  ulvila , it 's twin cities are ( or towns ) are ljusdal in sweden and suure-jaani in estonia . 
  no influence what so ever . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ they are good welders and you steal cars . 
  in power is pretty loose definition for their current part in the government . 
  [ this ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/5085764/landscape16_9/1024/576/3b2a4e7b3a2a6979fcac9cc08575f754/yr/29474529.jpg ) is a good representation on whose agenda this government pushes . 
  i do n't know the exact origin , but word `` vittu '' is used in similar manner here as `` fuck '' is in english , regardless of the different meaning . 
  it is very possible that it is just some localization of `` fuck off '' .
