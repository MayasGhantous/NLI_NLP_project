  it 's meaning is , after all , for the object to get out of sight . 
  jumalauta , which literally means `` may the god help '' . 
  saatana , which translates to satan . 
  so when a finn stubs their toe they yell `` satan '' . 
  same thing with perkele . 
  our equivalent of `` piss off '' would be `` painu vittuun '' which translates loosely to `` go to vagina '' . 
  well , at least helsinki uni acts like it 's the only one in the country . 
   for example , the `` right to be forgotten '' trumps free speech . 
  are perhaps referring to the google spain case ? 
  we do n't need a region for that , we already have our fennoswedes . 
  that is true , but in the end of the day the fact remains that we have waged two wars over our territory and we do n't have kekkonen to sent hunting and drinking with hru\u0161t\u0161ov whenever things get dire between us . 
  enough to hope it survives , not enough to make huge personal sacrifices for it . 
  do n't worry , we are also secretly expecting you to collapse under immigration . 
  unlike the baltics we are not in nato , so our only security guarantee is the eu one , which amounts to comforting words and a one statement from the president of estonia which , while heartwarming , is n't that great military advantage . 
  also add putin 's statement that our independence was a mistake and you might fathom why we would want to oppose russia anyways possible . 
  a satirical animation series `` the autocrats '' said in early 2000 's that if nokia were to leave finland , only thing remaining would be a handful of lapplanders and some shitty roads . 
  most likely he wo n't , as afaik norwegian justice system allows keeping the prisoner imprisoned after that 21 years if there is a reason to believe that he will be a threat to others or he is under a threat , which both are true . 
  not exactly a romeo juliet story , but we have [ kullervo . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kullervo ) he was abused as a child , escaped from slavery to find his family and seduces and sleeps with a woman , who turned out to be his long lost sister . 
  the sister commits suicide and kullervo goes into a murderous rampage and massacres the tribe who abused him and finally kills himself . 
  does that count ? 
  oh , we also have [ aino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aino_ ( mythology ) and v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen . 
  basically aino gets betrothed to an old sage named v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen by his brother in exchange of his life . 
  aino who , does n't want to be married with an old man , drowns herself . 
  so romantic . 
  estonian suonds like old savonian finnish spoken by a drunk , imho . 
  it 's a bit frustrating to listen to or read estonian as you can clearly understand many words and phrases but then there always comes a `` twist '' and suddenly you ca n't understand it anymore . 
  yeah i guess , but at least memes about you guys have some base in reality . 
  i mean , you do have muslims and feminists , although not in quantities as usually portrayed . 
  we on the other hand have absolutely nothing in common with steppe nomads , except some 10 % of mongoloid dna in our genetic heritage . 
  you can !, 
  depending , of course , how strongly you feel about being stabbed in the guts with a traditional carving knife . 
  vitafit bottled juices . 
  i can literally drink three bottles of that in a day !, 
  mostly we use barley , wheat and rye for everything , expect for this and some cookies . 
  and once again the finngol meme finds it 's way into my monitor . 
  i thought that i was safe from it today !, 
   you 're eager to join the eu and get funding to build up your shitty roads , but the moment shit hits the fan all the solidarity goes out of the window . 
  to be fair , that could also be said about some western europeans as well . 
   i was forced to , since they stood uncomfortably close and looked at me . 
  congratulations , you have fully assimilated . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/koskenkorva50cl.jpg ) is your badge of citizenship . 
  remember , do n't look people in the eyes on your way out . 
  this is what i just was thinking about !, 
  also , [ this .

  switzerland relaxed ? 
  well , that 's a new one . 
  yet, 
  for finland , [ this .

  so , [ basically this ? 
  bad geopolitical location between russia , sweden , poland and germany/hre does n't really increase population growth . 
  police here are usually very calm and patient . 
  they can ask for your id and in extreme cases detain you for a day if you cause trouble or for 3-4 ( ? ), 
  days if you are subject to criminal investigation , although they do n't do it for fun . 
  okay ; during the cold war when ~ ~ kekkoslavia ~ ~ finland was ruled by ~ ~ dictator ~ ~ president [ kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) , a powerful coalition emerged to beat him in the next presidential election . 
  they had a good lead in the race , but suddenly , the soviet union send us a [ note ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/note_crisis ) requesting an immediate reassessment of our diplomatic relations . 
  naturally everyone flew into panic , thinking that soviets are preparing to invade us , but not kekkonen !, 
  he kept his head cool and went to personally solve the issue with nikita khrushchev and soon enough soviets retracted their note . 
  kekkonen 's popularity soared and he got re-elected . 
  now , could it be that kekkonen , who had excellent personal relations with khrushchev , had asked him to send the note so he might win the elections ? 
  we might never know ... 
  so 19th century ? 
  it is mostly referred as '' * autonomian aika * '' as in era of autonomy , for we were made an autonomous grand duchy of russian empire . 
  it was followed by a period which is commonly referred to as '' * sortovuodet * '' or `` years of oppression '' when russians started to russificate us , although that name was adopted later . 
  the country gets fined by the eu court and they can pay it if they feel like it . 
  even though some ~ ~ ~ brits ~ ~ misguided individuals claim otherwise , eu members are sovereign nations that can do anything they want , although worsened relations and international prestige usually keep everyone in line . 
  edit : also , i am not sure , but if some eu country wants to deny entry from an eu citizen , they could do it legally by declaring them persona non grata , although it might be only used against diplomats . 
  russia has n't been great since alexander ii died , so do n't worry . 
  [ this ] ( http://gallery.stupidfusion.com/random_pictures/1365871511484.png ) is a really good idea . 
  i , in fact , suggest that we implement it immediately . 
  does this map even have estonian ? 
  or am i just seeing things . 
  [ sauli `` two face '' niinist\u00f6 ] ( http://doge.naurunappula.com/screen/16/0d/160de3fe8068c5c6/0/865847.jpg ), 
  well , you guys were ruled over by communists , so your distrust to all things bureaucratic is understandable . 
  still , it is an interesting difference between the nordic system and the system used in eastern/central europe . 
  where you see an oppressive and soulless piece of bureaucratic despotism , we ( generally ) see an agency that is necessary to protect safety and rights of children in extreme cases . 
  there is some mistrust and hate towards the system over here , but i have n't heard of any serious calls to reform or remove it . 
  i see . 
  interesting fellow , nonetheless . 
   as for poles ... 
  when norwegians tried to pull that stunt with a polish couple , the child was stolen back , black ops style . 
  i am curious , what does he seek to achieve with this ? 
  assuming that the child was taken from norwegian residents , would they just taken away if returned to parents ? 
  anyhow , there might be some bias against slavs in our and scandies ' child welfare , as poles , russians and such are often perceived as adidas wearing drunken car thieves and small time criminals . 
  also , the rules are strict in nordic countries , as you could lose your child for just minor public beating , which many foreigners do n't understand . 
   scandinavia is a popular destination . 
  that 's how much i can say about it , except that once upon a while you hear about their child services taking a kid away from their shocked parents for ( according to the parents ) bogus or made-up reasons . 
  this is a real pain in the ass with russia . 
  it feels like every time our child welfare officials deal with ethnic russians , they make it sound like we are on a crusade to wipe out the entire slavic race in media . 
  we have our older ( adoptive ? ), 
  brother sweden , who took us in and abused into civilization and who is bigger , better and more popular than us , thus making them our most loved rival . 
  then there is estonia , our true brother nation that just returned to our life from the clutches of the soviet union . 
  and we basically ran out of bullets while doing so . 
  why does anyone burn anything ? 
  for the glory of ~ ~ satan ~ ~ paganism , of course . 
  the only good thing coming from sweden , 
  sounds like a stage name of a mexican wrestler, 
  i do n't know how swedes handle it , but in finland at least student debts are guaranteed by the government , which means that if you ca n't pay them , the government will .
