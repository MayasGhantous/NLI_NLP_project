  that way you can you can at least get rid of the debt , if what [ u/the _ straylight_run ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/the_straylight_run ) is true . 
  also , i 'd guess that the debt is mostly for living expenses rather than for tuition . 
  they do ? 
  this made my day  also , why is it always danes who will argue to the death over proper use of the word scandinavia ? 
  hah , being moderate sucks even more these days , when everyone is either nazi or stalinist . 
  when both ends of political spectrum retreat in their own camps shouting at each others and to occasionally burn cars in the streets , nobody is interested in voice of reason . 
  moomins does n't really count as the most famous animation was made in japan . 
  if we 'd be counting european comics , then it would suffice, 
  well , they are a bit darker than us , so they have a decent shot, 
  basically all immigrants coming from south tend to stay here , as we are geographical `` end of the line '' along with norway . 
  ja , we speak swedish mycket bra, 
  someone has read their machiavelli . 
  so , who are we going to target after we run out of the jews ? 
  because they as nations are n't beyond reproach , unlike the current horde of people from around the middle east that is trying to get in europe . 
  saudis and libyans still want to enjoy reasonable relations with the west . 
  realpolitik over religious belief . 
  such is life in portugal . 
  well , it is reasonable , if you got to burn down some houses , you might as well take the nationalistic moral high ground and burn the refugees, 
  war is usually rather good at uniting nations . 
  same happen with finland during the winter war . 
  ( un ) fortunately real proper war will most likely not find it 's way here in near or far future . 
  and one could claim that this sense of unity was present after the second world war , resulting in creation of the european steel and coal community . 
  they say no , they send their coast guard or navy to respond . 
  as i mentioned , militarily forcing turkey to take them could be considered as an act of war , and war between modern countries is not nearly as pleasant today as it was back in days . 
  turkey , on the other , could in good conscience prevent our boats from landing , as they would be defending their borders . 
  also , using military coercion against turkey would be futile as they are part of the nato . 
  you are an optimist . 
  i fear that * some * country just says `` fuck it '' , elects a extremist government and starts purging . 
  either that or we end up with an u.s style colored ghettos with extreme poverty , while states cut back * our * welfare . 
   turkey refuses to take them back . 
  they are a sovereign nation and have a say on who is allowed to return . 
  they can also use force to prevent europeans from returning them to turkey , if they are so inclined . 
  and if they do that , what can europeans do ? 
  invade turkey to force them take back immigrants ? 
  was n't the good old socialist rally song `` international '' or something ? 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knk7dredg3i ), 
  and here in finland we have a pm who claims that he has never been drunk . 
   who passes the laws concerning whatever security forces that are obligated to protect you and the land you 're on from foreign invasion ? 
  who commands them ? 
  you are aware that these are not functions of the eu , but functions of the sovereign states ? 
  and as such are ultimately commanded by the head of the state in most cases ? 
  you are right , i do n't recall the entire hierarchy and process of decision making in the eu and ecb without looking it up , but if your country is not in the eurozone even those are handled by state institutions . 
  or i am misreading your comment . 
  [ way to go , storebror !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yydc2kt.png ) keep up the good fight for state paternalism and absolving unnecessary freedoms . 
  inb4 we start hearing distant cries of `` oppression ! '', 
  and `` western conspiracy ! '', 
  echoing from moscow, 
  so , in the real world : they wo n't x2, 
  our military doctrine has n't been to stop russia since the continuation war . 
  it 's about making the invasion so expensive for the attacker that they would reconsider . 
  thus bringing swedish manpower along with ours aligns with our general strategy . 
  fair enough , but i fear that somewhere down the line ** some ** country says `` fuck this shit '' and then we will see what cruel and unusual means , lest the situation is contained . 
  although i hope that it wo n't come to that and more countries would take the danish stance on the issue, 
  is it though ? 
  one of the core parts of this problem is that european countries have no reliable ways of deporting illegal immigrants outside eu . 
  but should we have a large offshore site with relatively small population , we could send them there to freeze out of sight and out of mind of the general population , granted that we weed out the real refugees from immigrants . 
  they can wait there while their immigration applications are processed . 
  then all that is left is spreading the word that we are deporting immigrants to greenland to middle east and northern africa . 
  talking about deterrent . 
   unless you think we 're building refugee camps in greenland . 
  you know , that would n't be such a bad idea . 
  what do they have against surrogate parents ? 
  yeah , hopefully . 
  i 'd just hoped that they 'd just shut down the border for all non-schengen non-visa immigrants and started to work the economy and debt problem but apparently that was too much to ask for . 
  but hey , at least they managed to anger the unions . 
  afaik in finland satire is pretty free , as we have and have had many shows and such making fun of politics and the system in general . 
  we had [ an animated show ] featuring current mp 's , the president and even world leaders like putin and blair airing from 2001 to 2008 . 
  on the other hand satire towards all national icons is looked down upon . 
  there were couple cases of immense media shit storm when field marshal , president and all around national hero figure [ mannerheim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) was portrayed as gay in a puppet show and when he was played by a [ black man ] ( http://hs13.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/960/1305835123945?ts=884 ) in a movie about him . 
  so , if someone made a mock version of our anthem , i 'd guess it would cause some unrest in media and in nationalistic circles and the public pressure might force them to resign if they held a public office , but i do n't recall any laws against satire of that kind . 
  it 's good that we finally have a trustworthy and honest government that does n't lie to the public . 
  yes , because albania is the shining paragon of european virtues and a true forerunner in social development . 
  truly a heavenly paradise among lands, 
  such is life in wales . 
  cold war in the most volatile region in europe ? 
  only good things can come of this . 
  how the hell did the swedes beat us in this category ? 
  must be their introverted drinking habits ... 
   and he needs to be willing to come to poland . 
  i am surprised that they actually found 400 human beings for that . 
  winter happened . 
  [ first thing that came to mind ] ( http://kuvaton.com/kuvei/lada3.jpg ), 
  love all the accents , hate their attitudes , have n't tried their booze yet . 
  ireland . 
  green countryside , modern cities , good food , low taxes ( afaik ) , stable government ( afaik ) , they produce my favorite beer brand and good whiskey , they are close to great-britain and rest of the western europe ** and ** their neighbor is n't [ this guy ] ( https://futuristrendcast.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/putin-winks.jpg ), 
  eu is incredibly complex and ( at least in here ) only the basics are being taught in schools . 
  therefore it is entirely believable that they simply lack the information about the subject until recent events . 
  either the club shows you the door ( not in foreseeable future ) or it forces you to comply , which is what they are currently trying . 
  but where are the resident of that district supposed to get their quality kebab ? 
  i know some ardent neo-nazies that would starve to death without kebab . 
  they keep the streets safe today , that is a respectable . 
  but what will they do tomorrow ? 
  will they start to deport undesirables by themselves ? 
  as if we needed another [ lapua movement ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) . 
  ok , here are some finnish coat of arms that i think are interesting/funny [ finnish lapland ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapin_historiallinen_maakunta#/media/file:lapin_maakunnan_vaakuna.svg ) [ uusikaupunki ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiedosto:uusikaupunki.vaakuna.svg ) [ inari ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/inari.vaakuna.svg ) a.k.a a salmon with reindeer 's horns . 
  [ mikkeli ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiedosto:mikkeli.vaakuna.svg ) and my personal favorite , [ lapua ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/lapua.vaakuna.svg ), 
  exactly . 
  it is sad that politics are all talk and no action these days . 
  what has happened to the good old statesmanship , where politicians were competent and at least tried to make changes , instead of focusing solely on elections ?
