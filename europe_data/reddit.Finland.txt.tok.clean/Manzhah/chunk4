  we are not poor as somalia , but the cruel reality is that most of us are in dept. 
  add the lingering euro crisis and the immigrant wave and it 's easy to see where the economical boundaries lie . 
  yes , and if we would follow suite it would still cost money that no one has . 
  even if we started to summarily execute brown people in the streets as some in this thread have supposed , it would still take a massive legal rework of constitutions , criminal laws and european unions laws as well as resigning from several un agreements for all countries participating in this purge to make it legally possible , which too would cost us money no one has . 
  or we could say fuck it and let anarchy reing . 
  what should had the police chief and the portion of of the force done ? 
  charge in to the crowd to be battered alive ? 
  call in reinforcements that do n't exist ? 
  cologne is not a small town , plus it was new year 's eve which is extremely straining on the police 's already strained resources . 
  because those factors ca n't ( irc ) factor in the legal process . 
   thieves do n't try radicalizing other big time . 
  one could point out that turning small time criminals into lifers is exactly what jails in western world do . 
  it is in some cases , but that costs money that no one has . 
  you have a foreign legion , conscript them to it . 
  an unholy mix of patriotic fervor , feel of unity and general lack of segregation and isolationism between factions in a country, 
  there are always roles that require next to no combat in administration , support and such . 
  in fact , it would be good to fill these roles with weak and puny women so strong and fierce men filling those positions could be moved to combat roles, 
  to add on [ u/tehzerofin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/tehzerofin ) 's answer , the formal options are army , civil service or jail ( or being born as woman or \u00c5lander ) . 
  the unofficial ways are getting or faking severe physical or mental issues , but the downside is that it will be marked in your `` files '' , which may make employment in certain fields impossible . 
   `` even sweden did it '' finnish foreign policy in a nutshell !, 
  it 's entirely possible for central poland or germany to get colder than nordic countries , since the gulf stream warms us, 
  and it works !, 
  just look at poland . 
  german politicians slam greece over handling of everything * here ftfy, 
   our countries are n't being ran on utilitarian ethics well they should be . 
  just saying . 
  concidering that most of these who currently advocate these ideas are generally youngster , it is not that straight forward . 
  and here i thought that all ee countries are founded on idea of not being russian, 
  as russia is both our mortal enemy and an existential threath , it is wise to limit their influence on our vital infrastructure , at least untill we reach the second glasnost . 
  besides , i 'd wish that my country does n't fall into same energy racket that gazprom runs with eastern european countries . 
  as long as it 's not russian it 's all good . 
  funnily enough , our center party is pretty pro-russian , or at least was during the last government . 
  that miniscule amount is still money that could be used to fund for some minor leaks in the budget . 
  if all local alcoholics bought their booze from their local alko , it would surely keep some rural roads in usable condition , at least . 
  also regarding drunken tourists , stopping to sell alcohol to them would just drive people to germany or other baltics instead . 
  it would propably increase the amount of legitimate tourists , who come to enjoy tallinn as a city . 
  most of it is legal , but there are smuggling , as many 18 years old make cheap trips to estonia and buy over 22 % booze there and illegally bring it back into finland as customs rarely check people on that route . 
  you are aware that our state loses a ton of tax income annually because everyone is smuggling alcohol and tobacco from estonia , right ? 
  `` tuhansien j\u00e4rvien maa '' ( land of thousand lakes ) is one expression which i have heard , but that refers to the land itself rather than the people . 
  on a similar note , karelia was referred as karjalan laulumaat ( karelian song lands ) during the national romanticist period . 
  currently 12.28 in here . 
  just chilling in the army after lunch , waiting for the next service to begin . 
  hah , after breivik did his thing the front page of the largest tabloid in finland screamed with huge letters : '' ** breivik played wow ** '' . 
  nothing new under the sun . 
  and after that they ban non-procreative sex altogether . 
  then it 'll be just like victorian times . 
  that 's always the case in representative republics . 
  a funny example , during the second world war , finland had a co-operation pact with germany , but when the situation became unbearable , we back stabbed them by claiming that the pact was a personal agreement made by the president and not actually binding for rest of finland after his resignation . 
  it could be , but it could also be twisted into `` cameron just spoke his personal thoughts , this particular speech does not represent the intention of hm 's government '' . 
  it shows '' the will of the people ^ tm '' , not the actual political intent of her majesty 's government . 
  and because britain is a modern republic , those two have no correlation . 
  ah , this is everything i hoped for . 
  i knew that brexit would lead to some quality entertainment , but this !, 
  the land of comedy , truly . 
  impressive , never the less . 
  he makes my cv look empty by comparison . 
  pretty good for one person , do n't you think ? 
  40 years is practically impossible to get in europe , as even the icc hands 30 years max or a life sentence , and you 'd have to deal in genocide to get one of those . 
  for finland , the legislation is [ there ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2011/en20110806.pdf ) . 
  particularly relevant bits are section 2 of chapter 1 and sections 2 and 3 of chapter 2 . 
  you are allowed to used ** reasonable ** amount of force to apprehend a criminal . 
  also criminal code ( 4:4 ) allows citizens to protect themselves against immediate or current illegal attack . 
  measures used should again be ** reasonable ** for the situation at hand , i.e you ca n't shoot an apple thief . 
  what is reasonable and what is n't comes down to lawyers abilities . 
  if means of defense are judge to be reasonable , then you ca n't be prosecuted for using them . 
  however , according to criminal code ( 4:4.2 ) , the defender is free of responsibility if no alternative courses of action could had been reasonably expected from them . 
  this applies even if measures used in defense were judged to be unreasonable , i.e shooting a charging attacker . 
  also if the sentence for using unreasonable means for self defense is judged to be too harsh , the sentence can be lifted . 
  here 's an english translation of the [ criminal codex of finland . 
  ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf ) as for gun and carry licences , i do n't know the legislation regarding those so i leave those to someone else . 
  although i doubt carrying weapon in your personal vehicle would be allowed , as regulation on handling weapons tends to be rather strict . 
  a good [ puukko ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=puukko&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewik0jieml_nahvxb5okhvtqaekqsaqigg&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955 ) would be handier . 
  i 've read max hastings ' all hell let loose and at times i wonder whether germans and especially japanese were actually trying to conquer the world or just trying to kill as many people as quick as possible, 
  i do n't understand , why do europeans believe isis to be a threat to europe . 
  they are over there somewhere fighting a stalemate war and that will not change in foreseeable future . 
  the best they can do is a medium scale terrorist attack in some european metropolis that kills less than a thousand lives . 
  couple of cold summers could had been more deadly in the past . 
  moreover , they are only a symptom , if an aggressive one , of the true threat , which is islamism . 
  and even that is not true existential threat to the western nations , compared to russia for instance . 
  well , we had two weeks of warmth and sunshine . 
  just like last summer . 
  well fuck , i was starting to think we were about to have a proper summer this year . 
  according to [ asetus virkavalasta ja virkavakuutuksesta sek\u00e4 tuomarinvalasta ja tuomarinvakuutuksesta 3 \u00a7 ] ( http://finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1987/19871183 ) members of the council of state i.e government , who are de facto always parliamentarians , swear an oath of office and a judicial oath or give an guarantee of office and a judicial guarantee . 
  the oath mentions god , whereas the guarantee does n't . 
  the oath of office is loosely translated to `` i ( name ) promise and swear in front of the all-powerful and all-knowing god , that i will follow the constitution and other laws in office and to act justly and without favor for the betterment of the citizens and society '' . 
  the guarantee of office is translated to `` i ( name ) promise and swear by my honor and conscience , that i will follow the constitution and other laws in office and to act justly and without favor for the betterment of the citizens and society '' . 
  judicial guarantee/oath follows mostly the same pattern . 
  edit : corrected some mistakes . 
  pori is not ** that ** bad . 
  only most of it !, 
  well , the freemasons tried to burn pori . 
  that 's basically `` illuminati confirmed '' level of news .

  they have not yet committed crimes , but their founder mika ranta has a criminal record that includes an act of violence against a foreigner in june 2015 , so i would n't put it past them . 
  drunken stupor and periodical shouts of `` perkele '' and `` saatana '' ? 
  i do n't really know , all finns i have met abroad have been somewhat nondescript . 
  then again , i too am somewhat nondescript . 
  considering that you played against canada after we walked over them right before that . 
  just a personal observation , every time aforementioned happens in a sub where people have country-based flairs , it 's always danes :p like , never norwegians or swedes .
