  `` finland is part of scandinavia '' . 
  usually when this is said , hordes of angry danes rush in to correct it . 
  individual russian citizens own quite bit of land here . 
  if they reeeaaly would want to push limits of logic and sense , they could get a cause from that . 
  `` see tovarishch , some russkiy own some finski land , da ? 
  for sovetskiy soyuz !, 
  this is what they are going to do : they order their artillery to fire at some of their villages , lets say [ berkakit ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/berkakit,+sahan+tasavalta,+ven%c3%a4j%c3%a4,+678990/@56.5408069,124.8194246,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5c18973577135d41:0x83a9ab43eb403977!8m2!3d56.5757498!4d124.7837448 ) , claim that it was swedish artillery who did it , find some swedish expat , make them to set up a puppet government named people 's government of sweden , have it ask russia to send forces to protect the proletariat of sweden and voila , a perfectly legitimate casus belli ( in russians ' eyes at least ) . 
  estonia 's president said that they would help us , if i recall correctly . 
  then again , i am doubtful about nato saving us even if we were members . 
  as far as i know , the article five has n't ever been properly invoked in defense . 
  i would n't trust uk or france coming to anyone 's but themselves aid ( 1939 poland says hi ) and germany 's military is rather weak . 
  sure , poles , scandinavians and baltics could join out of solidarity if nothing else , but it would be irrelevant against russia in the long run . 
  americans might join ( depending on their election results ) but their main force is too far away and using ballistic missiles could escalate things to mutually assured destruction . 
  we would be equally fucked with or without nato . 
  oh boy , here we go : * first of all , finland is suomi * sweden is ruotsi * denmark is tanska * russia is ven\u00e4j\u00e4 * estonia is viro * poland is puola * hungary is unkari * france is ranska * germany is saksa * chezchia is t\u0161ekki ( and bohemia is b\u00f6\u00f6mi ) * spain is espanja * greece is kreikka * norway is norja * ireland is irlanti * austria is it\u00e4valta ( literal translation of \u00d6stereich ) * china is kiina rest is pretty much the same , or with minor changes . 
  well , uk has a reputation of being fond of surveillance , so i would n't put it past them . 
   it sounded like the worst radio station on the planet . 
  that 's the point !, 
  it 's so shitty it 's funny . 
  we live in a stock market based economy , anything could cause recession . 
  there is a reason why laissez-faire approach is so rarely utilized in anything . 
  an analogue : imagine relations between various european countries as a ball game without rules , with countries as players . 
  sure , at first all participant countries would play in unison , but when one country realizes that nobody enforces the rules and that breaking them would lead to a desirable results . 
  thus that player would be cast out of the game , which leaves a vacuum of power in to the field to the benefit of one team , giving them an unfair advantage . 
  or if not , the set of rules players were following would lose legitimacy if breaking them is allowed , and soon none would follow them . 
  that 's why organizing free trade between 28 requires rules and thus legislation : there must be rules and at least some form of enforcement to ensure fair and honest dealing between participants . 
  as * pacta sunt servanda * is one of the few principles of law all countries around the world agree to , passing enforcing legislation by multilateral treatises ( as it is currently ) is as good start as any . 
  as for wealth transfers : if players of one team are significantly under equipped , it will cause imbalance in game , which is unsustainable and unfair in the long run for the inferior side ( case in point , colonial powers and africa in the past or china and africa today ) . 
  by transferring wealth from rich countries to poor countries , the poor ones can build up infrastructure to actually compete or at least have more equal economical footing against the rich ones , thus promoting fair trade and dealings . 
  the military co-operation in the eu is not an issue of the union per say , as it 's mostly done through unaffiliated nato , through battle groups , which may include non-eu countries and it all based on lisbon treaty , which afaik states that csdp will lead to common defense for eu when all member states and the council unanimously agree to it , which is never . 
  all in all , these institutions such as eu legislation and wealth transfers are a safeguard for us smaller countries against the more powerful ones . 
  i agree , it 's not perfect how it is now , but it would n't get any better by tearing everything down . 
  i do n't know about you , but if i 'd snap and go out in a shooting or stabbing spree , i 'd shout something catchy like allahu ackbar or hakkaa p\u00e4\u00e4lle . 
  is it just me , or is our economy based purely on getting lucky with one jackpot and living off it until it all comes crashing down ? 
  during the cold war people said `` nah , the east trade will never end , no need for a backup plan '' . 
  same with nokia . 
  you might be right , as i am not an economist nor that well versed in economic history between us and russians . 
  as for  there are still people , especially among the older generation , who seem to long for the old days . 
  this is my point exactly . 
  people who grew up during the cold war want to cling to it , as the trade has molded their perception about all trade in general . 
  they might not want to look for other trading solutions , as traditionally a large trade partner has always been within arms reach . 
  it 's like an economic stockholm syndrome . 
  i 'd say because we are in a geopolitical dead end when it comes to trade . 
  you baltics are cheaper than us due to obvious reasons and sweden and norway , who produce somewhat same commodities as us , are better at branding themselves , in addition of being better connected to the european market by land . 
  these things pressure our economy to be extra innovative , and when nokia managed to be just that after the 1990 recession , we decided to keep on betting on the winning horse . 
  then apple and nokia 's bad management happened and the rest is history . 
  also regarding the russian trade , it is not so easy just `` pull a 180 '' with it , as it is the thing that * made * finland what it is today . 
  before the soviets forced us to kick start our steel industry to pay war reparations , finland was a agricultural nation . 
  after the trade began , we were able to build one of the most extensive welfare states in the world . 
  although after soviet union 's fall it had reduced importance , it still retains lot of sentimental value in the hearts of the current ruling generation . 
  on the contrary , calling nc a right wing party is absolutely justified , they just do n't bother with the moralizing that is often seen among their peer parties in europe . 
  instead they focus solely on privatizing public property . 
  i 'm absolutely certain , that if they were n't hampered down by our coalitionist political traditions , they would 've privatized everything , including the parliament and defense forces . 
  `` kepu pett\u00e4\u00e4 aina '' - an old finnish proverb, 
  iirc they officially are traditionally liberal these days , albeit they * were * ** the ** conservative party after independence , proposing monarchy and what not . 
  they do have some goals , as our government is starting a testing period where regions can decide their language education by themselves , which potentially means dropping the mandatory swedish language education , for what they have campaigned for some time . 
  iirc municipalities also got some say on immigration matters , whether they will house asylum seekers or not for example . 
  all in all , finland has a tradition of strong local governance , so they are interested on having a piece of it . 
  if you are lucky ( or in most cases , unlucky ) the government will force you to take a random job , or you 'll lose benefits . 
  the gist of it is that these `` jobs '' are at best really far from you in terms of educational background or far away from you and outright slave labor at worst . 
  was n't * `` koti uskonto is\u00e4nmaa '' * pretty much the unofficial motto of the `` white finland '' ? 
  i 'd recommend that we copy monaco and choose * `` jumalauta !, 
  '' * as our motto . 
  you got food bags in case support messes up ? 
  only thing we got was hunger . 
  tbh , if some corsican guy would crown himself as the emperor of france and lead her to conquer half of europe , could you imagine the memes it would generate, 
  [ it also is n't * that * far from what finland actually was at it 's largest point ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/finland_administrative_map_1942_1944.png ), 
  [ but wait , there 's more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_finns ), 
  it would have been so much more tolerable to wade in a constant blizzard and sleep in leaking tents for two weeks if we had that background music irl . 
  i.e died by natural causes, 
   if halla-aho becomes the party leader , that would be a completely different party . 
  afaik he did say that he is going to make them an anti-immigration protest party . 
  and besides , they do know , after this election cycle it 's just easier to sit on the sidelines and complain , than actually do anything . 
  it seems that the finns had a really negative image of spaniards in the 20th century . 
  in rather popular novel , [ the adventurer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_adventurer_ ( novel ) by mika waltari , spain is described as a barren and hostile wasteland and spaniards as incredibly greedy , hateful and lazy people who would do anything for gold . 
  in fact , in books depiction of sack of rome , the german mercenaries did it for lutheran faith , whereas spanish mercenaries did it for the opportunity to loot and rape . 
  well , in nordic countries we have coffee breaks , but you can drink tea instead of coffee, 
  and this brings us to the moral dilemma : who is at fault in a fraud ? 
  is it the one whose money is taken in the fraud ( the eu ) or the one who orchestrates the said fraud ( the random hungarian ) ? 
  well , as u/badrandolf said , it 's money spent on * research * . 
  i myself think that even unsuccessful research is worth the effort . 
   it does n't have a history of colonialism ( ok outside of europe ) [ well , technically ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_overseas_colonies ), 
  joke 's on you , i actually know people who sincerely believe that . 
  they had more of everything , but they were horrible at using them in the beginning of the war . 
  in the winter war , for example , they marched their troops in closed parade formations against fortified lines with machine guns until finns would literally run out of bullets . 
  the entirety of finnish field artillery and mortar units would fire about 1000 grenades per day , whereas soviets would fire about 4500 per day in kollaa front alone . 
  `` the enemy of finland always come from east , south-east or north-east , unless those bastards are flanking '' - certain sergeant to us during an exercise . 
   can we really be sure about that ? 
  what were the reasons why people opposed nato ? 
  damn if i know , but only party that has traditionally supported nato membership in any form is kokoomus so that 's one indicator  it did ? 
  i would n't really call finlandization that much of a success . 
  neither would i , but try telling that to baby boomers . 
  might be the fact that most of our population was against nato until ukraine happened . 
  people saw that paasikivi-kekkonen doctrine worked and thus did n't want to break status quo . 
  good . 
  if something is illegal to do to adults it should be illegal with children as well . 
  just my two cents . 
  hmm , national quotes ? 
  one pretty well known is `` kollaa kest\u00e4\u00e4 '' , `` kollaa will hold '' in english . 
  it originates from the battle of kollaa during the winter war , when a major general h\u00e4gglund asked `` will kollaa hold '' from lieutenant juutilainen , who answered `` kollaa will hold , unless orders are to run away '' .
