  also during later stages of that battle , when soviets almost broke through the line , the last officer of his company , reserve lieutenant martti uosikkinen made a counter attack with only his messenger , got mortally wounded and as medics were taking him to dressing station where he later succumbed to his wounds , he said to his remaining men `` remember , kollaa will hold '' . 
  that quote essentially solidifies `` the spirit of winter war '' and the general perseverance of finns . 
  maybe russian military should invest in better navigation systems . 
  it seems that their planes , submarines , special forces and tanks get lost in their neighbors ' area all the time . 
  maybe they have forgotten to update their maps after the fall of russian empire ? 
  because they are the only superpower in the world with nukes , army and economy to cause unmeasurable damage on anyone they fancy to ruin ? 
  we were n't a colony , as swedes never really made settlements in finland , they rather formalized areas where finns were already living as cities . 
  also during the swedish reign finland was an integral part of swedish real , although ruled locally as was custom during feudalism . 
  after reign of gustavus adolphus there were n't even any finnish nobles left . 
  during russian rule we were autonomous grand-duchy under the czar in a real union , where we were granted all privileges of a sovereign nation except right to an army or right to sovereign foreign relations . 
  that 's also due the fact that a big part of finnish nationalism is being anti-russian , which is not the case with france or uk . 
  so funding true finns would be detrimental if their end goal was to weaken eu and at the same time bring finland closer to russia . 
  although , i do n't understand why they wo n't fund kepu , because they would gladly sell themselves for a pile of boards . 
  true , turkey should be challenged , but military measures are not the correct path imo , as that 's beyond eu and turkey , but a matter of nato, 
  would n't leaking turkish military intelligence be a bit questionable as both germany and turkey belong to the same alliance ? 
  indeed . 
  ancient finns believed that seers , called tiet\u00e4j\u00e4t ( literally `` knowers '' ) could change the world by possessing knowledge about world in form of poems and that knowledge could be made into a spell by singing it like in the video . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvxun84ktli ) is an example of a runolaulu , oldest form of music in finland , which basically were poems , spells and prayers sung with kantele music . 
  it was prevalent mostly in eastern finland , karelia and ( afaik ) estonia , but it 's not really practiced anymore . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17or2paj5cy ) on the other hand is not exclusively finnish form of music but it was the dominant form of folk music in western finland until the modern period . 
  and of course , [ the most well known example of finnish folk music . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ), 
  ca n't really argue with that . 
  i guess we will have to see which way the pendulum swings . 
  that is true , but i 'd still refrain from comparing hypothetical future brussels administration to the long list of russian transgressions against our people from the times immemorial to common day . 
  hell , there is a significant change that eu wo n't even live to see 2020 . 
  there 's a chance , sure , but it 's up to them , not us . 
  kinda like we can hope that turkey suddenly transforms into a shining beacon of democracy , peace and human rights , although we both know it wo n't happen . 
  that 's because they do n't want it , as they as people enjoy their role as the villains . 
  because you are a southerner , russia is not , nor has ever truly been an existential threat to your nations sovereignty , your lives , your language , your culture and and your entire way of life . 
  just small things like these . 
  there was some hope for russia after the soviet union collapsed because of it 's own impossibility , but now with putin we are back in square one . 
   in the end the only difference between russia and a federal eu is that one of them hates gays . 
  that 's pretty unfair towards brussels , keeping in mind all the shit russia has put us through . 
  true , though i personally find it funny that mps in finland wear camo and reflective vests . 
  based on the board in the background i 'd say this picture is taken in some garrison , where these boys are just about to begin their conscription service , hence the hairstyle . 
  finnish mp use [ reflective vests ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=spolle&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi3h6kiqsbrahwkpzokhasmckuq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=sotilaspoliisi+aseet&amp;imgrc=mygnxqs3ggip8m%3a ) while on guard duty . 
  i think that it 's good that troops , whose main purpose is to retain order stand out . 
  ours are called dogs . 
  as a whiskey and rum lover , tell me about it . 
  also that is just the official nationwide selection , on store level the selection is really limited . 
  for example , there is only one store within 30 km that sell blackbush . 
  oh i 'm so going to save this gem for a rainy day . 
  [ here is the selection of finland 's alcohol retail monopoly . 
  we have never been in the business of leveling cities though . 
  not even during continuation war when we were within range of st. petersburg . 
   conscripts in ** artillery ** ** units ** train moving their artillery / ** mortars ** to new positions a lot . 
  triggered also , one must mention that we are rather good at camouflaging our gear . 
  my instructor told us once how our amos squad in saber strike 15 was so well camouflaged that nato drones never found them . 
  social liberalism in this context . 
  not to be confused with classical liberalism , which is the one promoting free markets and such . 
  social liberalism is/was a important part of european workers ' parties , i.e left wing parties ' program . 
  do n't know about aldi but in spring 2015 lidl aired an ad campaign where the government had supposedly banned grilling with stasi-esque `` supervisors '' and all . 
  [ good stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr2eue46pu ), 
  tbh , it 's harder to kill large amounts of people with knives or fists than with semi-automatic firearms . 
  then again , everyone was sterilizing their `` undesirables '' in the 90 's . 
  for example , sweden , the land of social progression did it until 1975 . 
  hell , in finland some hereditary diseases , like epilepsy and deaf-muteness prevented legal marriage until 1969 . 
  hello netherlands and sweden, 
  the thing is , you will always get in trouble by killing someone , provided that you get caught and even if you do n't , someone will investigate the killing sooner or later . 
  laws against hate speech , on the contrary , only apply in practice to famous people , like celebrities and politicians as well as media personnel , because people are actually interested on what they 've got to say . 
  a random bloke , like me or ( presumably ) you , can freely spout shit like `` jews are subhumans who need to be killed '' or `` lynching black people is a-ok '' . 
  sure , it can get us banned from the community in question but is not covered by the laws regulating free speech , but i highly doubt that police would be arsed to come knocking on our doors for occasional shitposting . 
  i 'm young , just off the military and without a proper profession , so in order to get teh moneys , i 'd need to be in a continuous employment for five months , bring peace to the middle east , cure cancer , remove poverty from the world and throw the one ring into mt doom . 
  i might not be a pro on sucking money out of the system but i do n't question why some would rather just cut all contacts with society and live as outcasts anymore . 
  one could also argue that you are allowed to say those things , you just * might * face legal consequence for saying those things . 
  at very least once and that was uk declaring war against finland * because * the soviet union , an extremely authoritarian dictatorship , ordered them to . 
  not a great precedence . 
  nah , it 's only about 14-20 kilos , atleast these used in finish defense forces were about that heavy . 
  a trained fireteam can haul hunreds of rounds in suprisingly small amount of time . 
  bah , light mortars are for pussies . 
  120 mm heavy mortars for the win . 
  [ was n't it the allies ? 
  ] ( https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/11/baltic-sea ), 
  granted i do n't have any first hand experience about the subject , but way i hear it , corporations fill their end-of-the-latter positions by cycling `` interns '' , so those positions rarely turn into careers . 
  also ,  you talk like these people will suddenly find some charity that will employ them , well guess what , that almost never happens . 
  no need to patronize me , i share your opinion on this matter . 
  that 's just how the wind is blowing . 
   it also means that the results do n't necessarily extrapolate outside finland , though fair enough , as i do n't believe our center-right coalition is trying to build some global utopia , rather than lower the costs of our welfare system and make shite jobs ( that are currently done either by immigrants or welfare slavery ) profitable again . 
   if you know something will maybe taken away for you ( because it is for example just research or a experiment ) you are more likely to prove that you are more productive than when you are sure you get the money no matter what . 
  on the other hand , current finnish benefit system is so draconian and vindictive that it absolutely discourages people from seeking work . 
  there have been cases of people losing their right to benefits overs receiving tips for playing guitar on the streets and what not . 
  so basically , unless you manage to land a job that pays substantially more than benefits , it 's not worth the risk and that 's what they are trying to fix with this ubi system . 
  shittiest part of being a singalist , right there . 
  i have been to denmark once in my life , and remember only three things : * 1 . 
  constant rain * 3 . 
  five stories tall advert with a naked woman on it in the middle of copenhagen, 
  do n't give up just yet . 
  alexander ii is remembered rather fondly here , due to him giving us autonomy and declaring us `` nation among nations '' . 
  nikolai ii however ... 
  then again , their country is a product of an armed rebellion against a government that was perceived as tyrannical . 
  one day my lieutenant decided that we did n't actually need that goddamn cable . 
  after that my job went from running in the forest into tending fire places . 
  happy days . 
  `` working finnish defense forces comm cable '' . 
  : ddddddddddd, 
  for last two decades or so , there has been a strong political doctrine in play , called [ `` cheese slicer '' ] ( http://ultimathule.fi/5943-thickbox_default/ultima-thule-paakallojuustohoyla-poronsarvikahvalla.jpg ) politics , in which successive governments cut roughly equal slices of all public spending . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  finland and the soviet regime were in war following the finnish civil war , so expeditions before 1920 were legally justifiable . 
  after the 1920 peace treaty the only major expedition was during the east-karelian uprising and all finnish troops involved were volunteers , so officially finnish state was not involved .
