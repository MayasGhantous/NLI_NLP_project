  burma is nice a orderly place , but sanctions made it poor . 
  politically incorrect opinion : countries colonized by the british generally do much better than the rest . 
  british colonies  dutch  french  portugese  spanish  not colonized  belgians edit : and this is based only on my own travels . 
  not sure if anybody has dared to make science papers out of this . 
  attack helicopters need airspace control . 
  keeping tanks running needs airspace control . 
  i d try to get modernisation of the mbts , cruise missiles for ganking the s500 and generally much more aircraft . 
  edit : and for romania , you need a whole lot of everything . 
  your mbt is t55 variant with 100m gun . 
  not familiar with the specific tank , but t55 's gun is obsolete . 
  ro also has 500 t55s , which are basically useless 60yo tank with small gun and bad firecontrol . 
  ifv is bmp1 with with spike missile and oerlikon 25mm . 
  sounds functional . 
  apcs 1000 + . 
  maybe enough . 
  anti air is on par with russian buk . 
  the range is not great , finland got rid of these . 
  you also seem to have mim 23 , the early us patriot . 
  also s-75 , which are early s class russian aa missile . 
  pretty impressive arsenal actually . 
  f16 ( old ) 12pcs . 
  too little , too old . 
  well , here is the new boat : pl-01 prototype . 
  btw this article says 900 active plus 400pcs of 72s in storage . 
  http://www.military-today.com/tanks/pl_01.htm then there is this infrantry fighting vehicle ( afv , not mbt ) proto : http://www.military-today.com/tanks/anders.htm  as said , most of the t-72 's are withdrawn . 
  only 159 remain , and they will be withdrawn soon as well . 
  no source for this , so just wind in the trees . 
  also they have a 2016 upgrade package for t72s designed : http://www.military-today.com/tanks/pt_16.htm from the article :  currently polish army operates 233 pt-91 twardy and 120 older t-72m1 tanks . 
  another 470 t-72m1 tanks are in storage . 
  250 leo2s + 353 active + 470 in storage = 1070 . 
  is this acceptable figure ? 
   hang on ... 1940 just called , it said the strength of modern combat forces is n't measured by the amount of heavy tanks anymore . 
  it s a proxy for military spending . 
  you could count the airplanes , if you want . 
  the point is that unless you central european freeloaders fork up some serious dough on the military , common european defense is a pipe dream . 
  currently the netherlands is defended by uncle sam and the poles . 
  good luck . 
  except the 3000 assault vehicles . 
  also 100 modern planes . 
  your linked document says 1000 . 
  reading is an advanced skill in netherlands ? 
  storing stuff in tunnels is completely fine since fielding the whole army in peace time is kind of waste . 
  grasping for straws are we ? 
  i read the whole thing . 
  in storage is completely fine . 
  finland is full of `` in storage '' gear , since the field army is 230000 and they all need apcs , trucks , weapons , rocket launchers , missiles , aa and so on . 
  in active service means out of the tunnels = getting used = getting old = bad . 
  only ammo gets expired . 
  equipment just loses performance value . 
  stuff does n't `` rust '' in the storage tunnels ... 
  there is a new polish mbt proto coming in 2018 . 
  so the t72s are there until 2023 or even longer , unless they have the space and just keep them . 
  ca n't find a single news source that netherlands has actually bought more mbts . 
  you have some guys serving in the german army tank company for 18 measly tanks . 
  so the date is probably the last relevant date for dutch mbts ... what a freeloading joke of a country . 
   the netherlands has 33 leopard 2 's link please ? 
  http://www.army-technology.com/news/news120180.html  the netherlands defence organisation has decommissioned the leopard 2a6 main battle tank ( mbt ) on range 6 at the bergen-hohne firing range . 
   11 tank battalion commander captain chiel nieuwenhuis said the removal of the mbts from service marked an end to 90 years of dutch tank history . 
  thats 2008 , but it reads :  responding to a question by mr ludwik dorn on the number of different models of tanks , i announce that supplied the polish armed forces is :  - 128 leopard 2a4 tanks ;  - 232 tanks pt-91 ( 92 - pt-91 , 27 - pt-91m , 113 - pt-91ma1 ) ;  - 584 t-72 tanks ( 172 - t-72 , 135 - t-72a , 254 - t-72m1 , 23 - t-72m1d ) . 
  feels safe man ... yellow motorized enemy in the east has 5000 t80/t90 , 10k t72 . 
  if you are talking unified eu defense : poles 1000 germans 300 finland 200 dutch 30 sweden 120 italy 200 france 200 norway 52 spain 330 old east block : 340 total ( ro , bg , hu , cz , slo2 , slo1 , baltics ) greece : 850 ( counting leo1 a4/5 , but not pattons ) total 3620 mbts without uk . 
  eu needs about 8000 additional mbts to duke it out with russia . 
  1000 mbts and 3000 afvs is nothing to sneer about . 
  germany has 200 mbts . 
  same as finland . 
  ( elegiggle , talking about freeriding the poles ... ) netherlands has zero mbts . 
  europe needs more money spent on weapons . 
  creating unified defense zone means nothing , if flycrap size finland is a `` major '' power in eu . 
  praise poland , our new overlords that actually have functional armed forces . 
  anyone else see a problem with mandatory and involuntary organ harvesting by the state ? 
  the goal here is fantastic , but certainly this needs a mail campaign to all citizens to return the `` organ donation statement '' . 
  tbh i like the local turks , but not a fan of current political direction in turkey . 
   the government says a new gate and a fence , about 660 feet long and 11 feet high and stretching from the storskog border point that 's 200m of fence . 
  i can see a football field from my window that has longer fence . 
   that is a real artillery round explosion behind them . 
  that could be a half kilo of plastic explosive under some dirt . 
  very hard to imagine a cameraman keeping his head up when incoming shell makes the whistle . 
  dodgy map . 
  here is the annual growth ( red line ) and annual mortality incl logging ( blueline ) . 
  1950-1965 looks bad , the rest is pretty solid . 
  that is 70 authors on that one paper . 
  they need to book 2 busses to get to team lunch . 
  just compared beijing to helsinki . 
  after living in each , i d conclude that this comparison tool is completely broken . 
  beijing quality of life is the pits , while helsinki is average . 
  bad tool . 
  ( popcorn please ) this is probably the most bizarre piece of news this year . 
  funny , sounds just like finland . 
  all the corners are dead , finland , portugal , greece and uk . 
  you know how bad is 93 % ? 
  nevermind that unesco gives 90.3 % from 91.8 % . 
  turkey = myanmar = peru . 
  that is fantastic , way above african countries afterall . 
  the us nukes being the issue , if you do n't read the news . 
  91 % female literacy in turkey . 
  as a north european , i am generally against cleansing . 
  sects can worship their selected magic creatures in peace . 
  yea the `` membership talks '' have been vetoed for a good month . 
  military coups , nuclear worries , religiously driven government , cleansing of religious factions , 2600km of volatile mountain borders , prosecution of kurdish minority , low rate of literacy , dismal gender equality , non existent democracy ... and a leader who wants to be a dictator . 
  this sure sounds like a fantastic addition to eu .
