  i ll wait until the actual radar testing gets done . 
  that thing is worse than mig21 if the stealth does n't work ( outside marketing efforts ) . 
  hehe . 
  denial is always the best answer to facts . 
  why ? 
  because fantastic murican engineering failed about 4 times , so koreans have to make their own howitzer ... 
  you are boxed in now bro . 
  they are clones . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lav_iii here, 
  well , replacing it with 50 years old swiss design manufactured in canada sure tells you a lot about murican engineering success ... ( lol ), 
  we also have this practical trial period where you can contemplate on combat performance of ifvs . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f8horywec spent mine in the panzer jaeger , which is similar to stryker brigade with better apc . 
  stryker is a ** canadian copy of 1970s swiss piranha . 
  ** the most modern us army apc right here . 
  meanwhile in germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puma_ ( ifv ) and meanwhile in the usa ( 4th failing program to replace the ifvs ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gcv_infantry_fighting_vehicle, 
  for your entertainment , take a look at this : `` pentagon wars - bradley fighting vehicle evolution '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axq2lo3ieba might learn something and get a good laugh . 
  f-22 has never been used and they made 200 after canning the whole project . 
  quite masturbating and smell the sunshine . 
  there is a great reason why f16 and f18 are back on the table instead of the failing f35 . 
  both of them are clearly inferior to typhoon in every single category ... american engineering looks good only for american point of view . 
  projects run late , get cancelled produce rubbish and cost 3 times the estimate . 
  list of usa military engineering failz in 2000s only : 1 . 
  ( 22bil +4 bil per ship ) 2 . 
  xm2001 artillery ( 11billion ) 3 . 
  cg ( x ) cruiser ( 3.2 billion or 0.2 billion , depending on the source ) 4 . 
  future combat systems ground vehicles 5 . 
  ground combat vehicle , follow up on the above , 3rd fail in row ... ( 2.4 billion ) 7 . 
  comanche helicopter . 
  expeditionary fighting vehicle https://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/expeditionary_fighting_vehicle ----- i mean look at the amphibious assault vehicle . 
  4billion spent and nothing came out of it . 
  unit cost was ** 22 million ** . 
  that buys you 2.5 leopard mbts with every gadget in the market . 
  22 million is a nice cost for ground attack aircraft or aa missile battery . 
  development started in 1984 . 
  30 years is a long time . 
  more typhoons in air than raptors though . 
  probably implication how much the generals really feel about the f22 , despite the humongous murican masturbation . 
  how hard can it be ? 
  american engineering is pretty garbage ... 
  even the chinese can do it . 
  i find israel a lot safer than large parts of paris . 
  and i am not even jew ... 
  in may ? 
  could have been , if it takes 2 months to process . 
  the idiotic mandatory water treatment to every shed took years ... 
  finland is wrong . 
  nobody talks about payments here . 
  insane regulations is more accurate . 
  for example eu has tried to ban smoke sauna ... edit : and last year eu tried to ban wood burning saunas that heat over 60c . 
  close . 
  my dick and tasty local iisalmi pale ale . 
  you ll genocide us like the armenians ? 
  come on , doooo it nau . 
  that none of the money used to `` help greece '' stayed in greece . 
  instead we helped global investment banks and german/french retail banks . 
  greek bailout is a wrong term . 
  german/french bank bailout is the right one . 
  nothing museum about that list . 
  the oldest stuff is 122m d30 , which has the benefit of using same ammo as the opponent . 
  2s1 gvozdika is probably the least combat worthy stuff on the list . 
  also missing 700 pieces of 120mm mortars , but that is not artillery . 
  considering swedes have outsourced their defense to finland ... nope . 
  on a thread that discusses extinct 3rd world empire ? 
  bit thick statement , do n't you think ? 
  yes i am joking , but avar khanate was discontinued in 822ad . 
  i think you are more confused than you think : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/europe_814.png/1024px-europe_814.png, 
  too bad russia is not finland anymore . 
  too bad ottoman empire is dead and buried . 
  here is the byzantine empire for similarly historical look : http://i.imgur.com/pqpwk74.png, 
  winters should be fun . 
  for the kids , and the local hip surgeon . 
  the people on the right are probably foreigners working in the factory construction project ... 
  3 months to summer rubber boat carnival and turkey promises to cancel the refugee deal . 
  somehow i doubt that statement . 
  sure bro , have a read : https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n93/221/90/img/n9322190.pdf?openelement acting part 1 . 
  `` demands that all parties concerned tread screb and it s surroundings as a safe area '' . 
  where does that say the un will defend it ? 
  seriously ? 
  i think you are just a little dull ... 6 months later un invaded with 54k troops , including the russians . 
  any connection here ? 
  hello ? 
  edit : and the disarmament is between the warring parties ... un spectates and serbs did n't give up the guns . 
  thus they got crapped on later the same year . 
  `` establish zones '' . 
  wrong . 
  agreement between warring parties establishes the dmz which un spectates . 
  how is this so mind mindbogglingly hard concept to grasp ? 
  un spectates , records and complains . 
  they ca n't even block you if you do n't shoot them . 
  if you do something stupid , like kill 8000 odd civs , this happens : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/implementation_force peacekeeping versus peace enforcement . 
  notice a difference ? 
   nato nations that contributed forces included belgium , canada , denmark , france , germany , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , portugal , spain , turkey , the united states , and the united kingdom . 
  non-nato nations that contributed forces included ; australia , austria , ** bangladesh ** , the czech republic , ** egypt ** , estonia , finland , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malaysia , new zealand , pakistan , poland , romania , the slovak republic , sweden , ** russia ** and ukraine . 
  [ 6 ] some odd countries there , including russians attacking their own ally . 
   troops they are not even `` troops '' . 
  they are guys with binoculars and pencils . 
  they do n't even have artillery , anti tank missiles or squad level support weapons . 
  peacekeepers and military intervention are 2 completely different things . 
  nato invasion of serbia was a military intervention , including aircraft carriers , cruise missiles , smart bombs , tanks and what not . 
  dutch in a bus with 12.7 ... you know they ca n't even shoot anybody , unless they are getting shot ?
