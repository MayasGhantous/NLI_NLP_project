  the serbs can just drive by , kill ** everyone ** and the peacekeepers take pictures . 
  then un bombs them later . 
  nope . 
   ** general [ sefer ] halilovi\u0107 and general [ ratko ] mladi\u0107 agreed on measures covering the whole of the srebrenica enclave and the adjacent enclave of \u017depa . 
  ** under the terms of the new agreement , bosniak forces within the enclave would hand over their weapons , ammunition and mines to unprofor , after which ** serb `` heavy weapons and units that constituted a menace to the demilitarised zones which will have been established in \u017depa and srebrenica will be withdrawn . 
  '' ** unlike the earlier agreement , the agreement of 8 may stated specifically that srebrenica was to be considered a `` demilitarised zone '' , as referred to in article 60 of the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949 , and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts ( protocol i ) . '', 
  serbs just did n't do their part , and un was there with these ( bus with a peashooter ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aifv#/media/file:pantserrupsvoertuig_ypr-765.jpg, 
  that was the demilitarization agreement between the warring parties . 
  you ca n't blame the dutch for the natives on both sides not following on the agreement . 
  unless you send in heavy tank battalion , artillery , 50 air planes and some other things to enforce the peace with . 
  peacekeepers are there to spectate and record on agreements the warring parties make . 
  nobody is going to fight your wars for you . 
  lulz mad bantz bro . 
  only problematic location is south sudan , where the muslims try to starve out the south . 
  legal technicalities ? 
  wtf ... un peacekeeping is spectating , it is not a rental army . 
  un troops are only lightly armed to avoid getting butchered , not because fire missions . 
  do you think the peacekeepers on golan are responsible for defense of israel ? 
  un peacekeepers are not defensive units . 
  the whole idiocy regarding the massacre blames it on the dutch for not engaging in warfare ... 
  in a war they are a neutral party . 
  map of all the un missions : http://www.un.org/depts/cartographic/map/dpko/p_k_o.pdf, 
  you racist forgot turkey . 
  definitely in center of future europe . 
  they like their dear psychotic leaders . 
  if turkey becomes a member with an active civil war , repressed females , despot and the theocracy ... 
  i ll be in new zealand . 
  also apparently they are changing the primary schools into more religions program . 
  and mandatory russia and turkey are not part of europe until the manic dictators buzz off . 
  m-files founded in 1989 . 
  i guess 30 years old company can be a start up . 
  the american m109 is outdated by any standard . 
   the contenders to replace the m109a3gns are the tracked samsung techwin k9 thunder , the wheeled nexter systems caesar , the tracked krauss-maffei wegmann ( kmw ) panzerhaubitze 2000 ( pzh 2000 ) , and a modernised m109 offered by ruag . 
  defense outsourced to the poles . 
  the new central european security plan . 
   and will buy new artillery ( archer ) , etc. 
  i though you ll get the korean k9 with finland and estonia . 
  ghastly . 
  next up : eu military budget , paid out of eu state payments . 
  used to ramp up the ( german ) defense spending that they have not done in the last 20 years . 
  i believe in functional eu defense when i see one . 
  missing the cia for planning the coup . 
  it russian . 
  `` bahtay '' or something .

  so where are we invading next , or why else the ass kissing ? 
  in 1990-95 when the paper machines were built ? 
  of course not ... cellphones did n't even have number screens . 
  now they are ramping box board production ( increases due to rise of china and international shipping ) . 
  while this happens currency should go down . 
  this is not possible in euro . 
  add russian sanctions , couple insane eu wide regulations suited for central europe only ... and here we are . 
  euro , russian sanctions , lower demand for newspaper paper and printer paper . 
  just for starters . 
  finland ? 
  pretty much the best run government in the world . 
  par none . 
  but do keep trying . 
  trying to think is good for you . 
  meanwhile finland is in recession ( q4 2016 ) with the other corner countries and south italy . 
  euro is so broken that this is not even funny . 
  i guess you can call a sausage in pool of mustard a `` sandwich '' . 
  the bread part has been brewed into liquid though . 
  i guess in major parts this is accurate . 
  translation for the slogan : you receive what you place the order for . 
  ( not photoshopped . 
  you can generate these using an applet on the finns party page . 
  epic ), 
  frankly surprised russia does n't issue russian passports to all the donetsk russians . 
  ex-soviet vehicles still in use : bmp-2 , mt-lb , d30-field gun , zu-23-2 , gvozdika , grad . 
  bmp is getting the polish upgrade kit soon . 
  most of the small arms are russian caliber . 
  ak47 , nsv 50cal , pkm machine gun . 
  makes the ammo resupply easier when using the same ammo as the opponent . 
  it is gets really expensive if a reindeer herd wanders below that barrage . 
  edit : and cost for one training rocket is 7000 usd per rocket . 
  not worried . 
  this is mostly `` accounting '' related change . 
  finland has 3 tiers of reserves : - conscripts in service ( 21000 men annually ) - recently trained conscripts returned to civilians ( 350k total manpower . 
  matches with russian invasion army ) - old trained conscripts in deep reserve . 
  ( 600k of men aged 35 + ) in practice they moved numbers from deep reserve to reserve . 
  this is mostly about the equipment this reserve needs , since deep reserve has lower standard of firepower . 
  lol you still have to live in that dump . 
  well . 
  russians drop couple brigades of paratroopers into \u00c5land with aa missiles and some seamissiles . 
  the dragsvik 's coast jagers will pile in there and try to get them out . 
  one party has no escape and other is doing contested beach landing ... lots of dead and thankfully none of them speak finnish . 
  finns ca n't buy land either ... kind of racist , but we ll leave them alone in their rocky island . 
  finland is mandated by un to enforce the demilitarization . 
  so if someone captures it , we need to remove those people . 
  and that s why dragsvik swedish speaking island troops have been trained in ridiculous numbers . 
  expecting many casualties . 
  foreigners ca n't buy land in \u00c5land . 
  also plenty of swedish speaking finns trained to take it back . 
  i did . 
  finland is not growing right now , just saying ... 
  sloppy ass crap getting flung too much for feelgoods . 
  last quarter finland shrunk , so nope . 
  fake ... http://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000005087139.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=www.hs.fi&amp;amp;share=09fc54d269d5698d697848c04fccb04e&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;,
