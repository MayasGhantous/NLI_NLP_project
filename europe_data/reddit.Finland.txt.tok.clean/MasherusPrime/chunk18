  how does an allele which promotes ending your life survive in a population , let alone become well distributed ? 
  edit : and i find these type locally specified genetic studies interesting . 
  here is a map for european suicide rate : https://mobile.twitter.com/amazing_maps/status/775767293544501252/photo/1 lithuanians suicide twice the rate comparing to latvians and 6 times more than the italians . 
  very strange . 
  we are seeing the birth of a new major smuggling channel . 
  time to do nothing for 3-4 years ... edit : the director of frontex is a french guy called leggeri ... 
  abandon hope . 
  where dafaq is funland ? 
  according to our press we are next to apartheid level in discrimination . 
  silly germans ... just ask the company to buy other land and plant more forest . 
  takes 40 years to grow , but eventually the problem gets solved . 
  what argument ? 
  i question the validity how eu makes these stats , since that number feels lower than what happens in reality . 
  yea , they should be testing them in syria like the rest of the world . 
  especially russia has been very active in the tests . 
  everybody does english and almost everyone in my upper secondary did german or french . 
  100 % study swedish , naturally . 
  only 20 % do german or french ? 
  rubbish ... edit . 
  maybe they count the `` secondary school '' years on european system , where s1 = year6 in finnish primary school . 
  that would explain the language number . 
  finland is probably 3.2 since swedish is a ** domestic ** language that everybody needs to study . 
  the truth about finland in r/finlandconspiracy /, 
  at 21 % more precisely . 
  someone really wanted uk to be red in this map . 
  surprisingly disturbing, 
  sounds rational . 
  the duties are lopsided as hell , where china imposes high duties on _ anything _ imported while eu duties are global . 
  we are talking cars , cheese , olive oil etc. 
  i d say type 4 with type 3 color . 
  i did witness a chinese guy shitting on floor in the waiting room of hangzhou train station when i visited . 
  the turd looked healthy though . 
  no lumps , even composition . 
  10/10 fiber content in chinese food . 
  solid move , but nato countries could also fix this faster with local laws . 
  the need is in october 2017 , not october 2027 . 
  notice that the un moves are camp refugees . 
  they get moved with annual quotas , which in finland is somewhere around 1000 . 
  nothing to with calais or mediterranean boat immigrants . 
  un refugees are basically stuck in camps for years without anywhere to exit . 
  optimal situation : boat refugees =  zero . 
  un refugees =  reasonable level . 
  economic migrants =  reasonable levels . 
  please read the damn budget ... http://vm.fi/documents/10623/3779933/selvitys_ahvenanmaan_talousjarjestelmasta_su.pdf/1b9dd9bf-2af2-427e-9b80-ff0d685a7c17 comes up to paf 100mil , regional subsidies 120mil , shipping company subsidies 72mil . 
  total around 300mil , or 10k per capita net budget transfer from finland . 
  subsidy fed little town that does n't want to belong to finland . 
  all in eu now , so swedes can pay this honorable 300mil for insular fishing village . 
  lulz . 
  did you actually check the budget , or has the brainwashing gone too far ? 
  15k per capita , when the average in finland is 7k . 
  plus a cool 100million windfall income from paf . 
  if poland would have a functional legal system , the protected areas would actually stay protected . 
  this is more about german greenparty politics combined with failing polish legal system than polish forest . 
  also , how does this differ from soviet union from the polish point of view ? 
  eu is killing itself over tiny little issue ... wasted political ammo . 
  how about fixing the judge hereditary empires in a balanced way ? 
  i d donate \u00c5land to sweden asap . 
  300mil/year money drain ... 
  [ most upvoted picture in r/suomi ] ( https://i.redd.it/bbo6l6t30yky.png ), 
  virtually no salmonella in the farms in finland . 
  not like it is mandatory to contract the bug to your animals ... 
  same religion , same culture . 
  speedy annex . 
  also need to ally kebab , for safety . 
  should have declared war over the 2014 sudetenland issue too ? 
  well , we will know in a few years . 
  hindsight 20/20 is masochism . 
  well , we are getting swindled or why the infographic is made like the reader is 5 years old ? 
  seems very fucking dodgy ... 
  probably it is a fair deal ? 
  great vassal , lots of cores + religious . 
  relax . 
  it is not your fault austria was named after british penal colony . 
  i did n't know austria has so nice beaches . 
  eu ca n't have russian shills as members when the decision making is unanimous . 
  would paralyze the eu from inside . 
  equal weight for testimonies . 
  how does a persons living place in africa/iraq completely neuter the eye witness testimony ? 
  also , in crimes against humanity returning persons to the original countries should be an option . 
  there is a dude in finland that burned a church full of people alive , and he is free . 
  that is completely unacceptable . 
  also , revoking residence or permits and citizenships for member of terrorist organisations should be automatic . 
  the local minorities suffer the negatives from having these people walking on the street . 
  except a videotape , recordings and known isis membership . 
  in case of the genocidal african pastor , most of the village testified . 
  `` evidence '' versus `` credible untampered evidence '' is the distinction . 
  in those cases local testimonies from the source countries were all declared invalid ... 
  especially interesting in the case of the genocidal pastor , where he is orchestrating a genocide as a leading public member of the community . 
   known to be violent ? 
  example from finland : 2 isis ( twins ) were tried for on video executions and head cuttings . 
  supported by recorded discussions in the refugee shelter concerning isis . 
  https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/iraqi_twins_freed_after_tampere_isis_terror_trial/9630142 not guilty . 
  also since publicity in iraq , they are now counted as well recognized and got full ride refugee status as a result . 
  other cases of `` severed head danglers '' sporting aks and isis gear . 
  no verdict , since `` the head was already severed when i found it '' . 
  there are at least 5 head danglers or known isis fighters living in tampere that i ve counted from the news . 
  this city has 180k people . 
  helsinki has apparently a whole lot of high level saddam 's old guard , ruandan genocidal pastor that directed massacres and so on . 
  it is well into the history already . 
  this discussion is just a bosniak attempt to whitewash their own responsibility to protect citizens from genocide .
