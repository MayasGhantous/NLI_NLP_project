  peacekeeping is observation . 
  only a retard expect light infantry to duke with numerously superior tank brigade . 
  if the mission is `` peace enforcement '' , then the soldiers ** demand ** completely different set of equipment . 
  and only cowards there were the 6000 bosniaks under ramiz becirovic . 
  that is a full brigade , when dutchbat had 450 people ( = half battalion ) . 
  this whole discussion is bosniak army covering for their own cowardly flight out of the pocket . 
  interesting ruling . 
  anyone know which court it is and whether it is the supreme court ? 
  if goverments are liable for un failings , then the peacekeeping moves into panzer brigades with helicopters instead of lightly armed reservists . 
  nato price for eastern europe is around one billion per year for one brigade . 
  massive impact potential to peacekeeping with this ruling . 
  as a finnish person i d be more interested in whether russia lasts . 
  the gdp has tanked couple years in the row , the visiting russians are very poor again and st.pete prostitute prices might have halved . 
  if russia breaks up , a lot of them will head to finland ... 
  good luck with the eternal sanctions though ... eu 's russian border will never accept the invasion . 
  got to protect the tax haven somehow . 
  it is a self defense weapon in britain . 
  the student lunch is like 2.5 e in the universities . 
  outside on the market it is between 9-12e for lunch buffet . 
  you did understand it is a reader poll , right ? 
  `` more technocracy , less politics '' got 3rd worst support ( 5 % ) , just above `` get turkey into eu '' . 
  btw here is something for you to think about . 
  finland bought 22 of these and nobody ( outside the generals ) has an idea why we are buying those . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mgm-140_atacms here is the range on map : https://www.google.fi/maps/@57.9151608,27.6234858,6.22z?hl=en, 
   so is estonia 's help not good enough for you , or what ? 
  more practical . 
  how are you shipping it over the gulf full of mines and russian antiship missiles ? 
  \u00c5land will get invaded straight from the start too . 
  there will be anti air battery in \u00c5land with 150km-200km range class . 
  quit thinking politics and start thinking how the actual soldier moves from france to estonia/finland . 
   i really do n't see what would be wrong with helping south korea ? 
  this is the key . 
  i really do n't see what is right in traveling all the way to korea to invade some random hill and losing 50 % of my men in one attack . 
  what the fuck ? 
  why should i go to die in some mad idiots war ? 
   putin is the one we 're seeking protection against in the first place . 
  estonia is . 
  we are fine in finland and especially fine when trump/erdogan are leaders in nato . 
   nato members are your allies who will come to your help . 
  look at the map . 
  how are you bringing help to finland if nato ca n't even get the help to estonia ? 
  serious question . 
  finland is an island for europe and the 1st russian move will be rushing for oulu .

  yes . 
  every single nato conflict from here on out . 
  if turkey fights russia , you ll be there . 
  in turkey . 
  you might even get pulled into `` non nato '' conflicts , like s.korea versus n.korea . 
   estonia has conscription too look . 
  there is a 10-fold power difference between finland and estonia . 
  finland trains 21k into reserve each year . 
  the active reserve is 280k . 
  200 mbts , 200 ifvs , 1600 artillery pieces , some 8000-12000 antitank missiles and another maybe 70000 antitank rocket ( law ) russian maneuver army can field some 180k troops with maybe 300-700 main battle tanks . 
  simple war , finland is in st.peter under a month . 
   based on some irrational fears 1 . 
  you are infantry 2 . 
  the leaders deciding about wars in 2017 : trump , putin , erdogan 3 . 
  ** you ** get sent to turkey because putin wants to fuck some gymnast and start invading countries . 
  or because trump is moron . 
  or because erdogan wants to be the sultan of ottomans . 
  you do n't ** really ** understand how conscription works ? 
   you can be in nato and also have independent defence capability . 
  this is not possible with professional engineers , it wizards , bricklayers , truck drivers and mcdonald 's sales men . 
  the defense is ** me ** . 
  i m an assault infantry squad lead and an engineer . 
  my best friend is an artillery battery commander and also an engineer . 
  my brother is in med school , but in army he is a helicopter mechanic . 
  my other brother is an aa-missile infantry , genius and develops algorithms for energy companies . 
  if russia attacks here , we will just collect gear from the army and get to front . 
  life is over anyway at that point if russia is trying to take over . 
  the options : a ) let russia take over -  sucks b ) pick up gun and stop them -  possibly die , but ** it does n't matter since the option is russians taking over . 
  ** this is how peasant armies work . 
  nato brings nothing in this mix , except pulls us into every single conflict with russians . 
  and by us , i mean ** me ** , personally . 
  i am reading this your comment chain in this thread and i d think you are wildly off base here . 
  a lot of finns do n't want to see their kids fighting in some mudhut wars . 
  this is huge . 
  i do n't want to see my godsons or brothers in libya/iraq/afganistan or any other `` liberation '' effort . 
  also the trust is an issue . 
  finland is even more peninsula than the baltics , making defense even more difficult . 
  it faster for russians to run over the country than ship help from europe . 
  so since trust in incoming help is low ( hello 1939 ) , everybody 's kids get send to sand countries for oil wars and because it makes almost no sense to capture the svamp called finland at expense of 500k dead troops ... -  makes little sense for finland to join nato . 
  until the next * soccer * game . 
  chinese free trade means free exports but massive import barriers . 
  ** anything ** they import gets taxed to hell or just outright banned . 
  beware of the chinese bearing gifts . 
   jassm is way more capable yea not , and especially at ** 3-5 times the price what us army pays for them . 
  ** nato arms deals with us reminds soviet arms deals of old . 
  20-30 years old garbage with triple price . 
  patriot deal = scam jassm deal = triple price , so just hard core gouging . 
  edit : and read this cruise missile analysis by the finnish defense academy from 2014 . 
  relatively impartial https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/98691/sk1707_nisonen_slo.pdf?sequence=2, 
  so us outsources the dev to israelis , since their own projects are regular disasters . 
  in david 's sling example the us company is the subcontractor for us units ... whoopee , such an honor . 
  iron dome is bought tech from israel . 
  israel out did us air missiles in 9 years with iron beam , iron dome , david 's sling ... 
  currently ** only ** competitive aa missile us has is sm6 . 
  please , do grab a donut on your way out . 
   far more expensive .
