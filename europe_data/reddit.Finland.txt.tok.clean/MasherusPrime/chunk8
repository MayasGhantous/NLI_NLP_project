  also veto all future us plans to blow up countries near europe . 
  a lot of local think we have 3 good ones : paasilinna , mika waltari and v\u00e4in\u00f6 linna . 
   helped finland keep back the soviets also denied the allied expedition force route to finland in the winter war and effectively drove finland to the german camp for the rest of the war . 
  you mean syrians and iraqies ? 
  large colonial targets right there , up until 2005 ... get a map . 
  i d think we can do with massive minelayers and coastal missiles . 
  you are right . 
  we should send them all to us for blowing up iraq , creating isis and now stewing the syrian conflict . 
  umm ... 
  the adidas tracksuit is still uniform for full time drug dealer ? 
  ( my romanian uni buddy in 1999 told me to grow a 2 week beard and wear full adidas tracksuit to travel safely in romania ... ), 
  this fella is talking out of his ass ... 
  he almost no power since union can only make decisions when most countries are in agreement . 
  also , this commissioner is * from greece where he has strong political backing for this relocation scheme * . 
  bag of hot air , holding a limp sausage . 
   according to johan backman this fellow is considered mentally challenged by most normal finnish people . 
  on the otherhand , if you are interested on the legal reasons a goverment can take kid ... read this : https://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2007/20070417 translation by google translate : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.finlex.fi%2fsv%2flaki%2fajantasa%2f2007%2f20070417&amp;edit-text=, 
   uk requires college education from electricians ? 
  the work result in uk housing is abysmal though . 
  i d say an average intelligence layman can do wiring better than upper scale housing in south england ... 
  this guy sounds like a legend already . 
  did he make a piss circle , or relay on the spray pattern ? 
  erected cock . 
  slightly disappointing headline . 
  they are already getting triple budget for next year . 
  supposedly we are expecting `` internal security challenges '' from the syrian travellers . 
  the `` fucking real estate '' is placed on : * end of military run ways * within 1km of vital air defense radar * within eyesight of ammo storage * 10 + plots in islands just outside military harbour near turku . 
  here is the map of the most suspicious purchases : http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/maakaupat2sl_uu.jpg, 
  last week it was mosul and righting the ww1 treaties . 
  this week islands . 
  next week hungary ? 
  russian vodka regulated minimum price was hiked last summer . 
  maybe some of the consumption moved to moonshine ? 
  the poor and pissed just got confidence boost from the brexit vote . 
  always been there , but angry plebs are invisible until they are real angry . 
  3.5 billion ? 
  pocket money eu puts 50billion to farm subsidies each year . 
  move some of that to `` airbus '' research . 
  it 's all french anyway . 
  wahlroos wants to work become luxury , so part of the salary is sub-vented by the social security system . 
  most money to stock owners , poor get poorer . 
  finland had candy tax previously , eu banned it . 
  here is a finnish report from candy tax : https://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewij7vjeqezpahwdfswkhx_7ctuqfghdmaq&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.keliakialiitto.fi%2fdocument.php%3fdoc_id%3d745%26sec%3d28bfcd44207aae5f09e7fe5d27755c38%26sid%3d1&amp;usg=afqjcne0tus4bimvpj8mnutupyjufafqjq&amp;sig2=6zcqcvz8dfdepn_yqbekya tldr : taxing candies is most effective in reducing kid 's candy use , which has life time benefits . 
  fatness for adults is not only candy related , multi pronged approach is needed for health benefits . 
  that would make good part 3 if it includes the religious school system together with the actual combat funding . 
  next episode : terror in europe - how gwb 's personal vendetta torched iraq and syria , and why it is costing european lives every year . 
  this post needs more budweiser . 
  something wrong with this study . 
  finnish university is 80 % alcoholism and 20 % reading . 
   freedom fighter invading your neighbors has nothing to do with freedom . 
  huffpost doing economics now ? 
  spanish unemployment rate 20 % . 
  labour participation rate 59 % . 
  ** spanish under25 unemployment rate : 43.9 % ** trend is good , but it is still mindbogglingly bad for spanish youth . 
  it s an illusion based on the projection of the globe . 
  north areas look expanded . 
  google shows you search results based on your own country . 
  in finland the syria is the 2nd after why russia is so big . 
  slovenia is like botswana , massively ahead of the neighboring reference group . 
  i ve googled that trying to figure out why . 
  why not naval eurocopter ? 
  that works so well with the french in charge . 
  copters 10 years late and 17 out of 20 nh90s are out of service . 
  where are the proofs for this ? 
  britain leaves -  more federal eu initiatives -  nordics pissed -  more countries leave . 
  that is the real domino , it will just be in real slow motion . 
  well , thank you anyway . 
  somehow i was expecting more from ft, 
   brexit made the `` chances of the eurozone not surviving in the next decade five times higher , '' dimon said according to a report in the financial times . 
  someone with ft access , pretty please ? 
  it is not innocent if it has a gun . 
  with brexit the nordics lose the only large anti federation country in the eu . 
  going to be rough ride for nordics since uk 's presence in the union has negated the more extreme federalist dreams . 
  the map . 
  outdated ? 
  just started navy visits . 
  the most basic 1st stage step ...  hanoi -- two u.s. warships this week docked at cam ranh bay , in the first such port call at the vietnamese naval base since the two countries normalized relations 21 years ago , the u.s. navy said tuesday . 
  long way to actually having a base there . 
  so : * vietnam . 
  this one might be coming . 
  vietnam needs backing due to china 's fishing water expansion and the old base was only closed 10 years ago . 
  old friendly un tagteam . 
  back to 80s , fantastic . 
  maybe more likely than cuba , but why ? 
  closeness to panama canal ? 
  great underrated cigar manufacturing ? 
  * singapore . 
  really ? 
  makes no sense for either party . 
  old ties , but new sweetheart is the usa . 
  not happening . 
  vietnam might happen for russia due us being shunned and vietnam needing backing , but cuba is n't going anywhere ... 
   f-16s are `` nuclear-capable '' for example : agm-158 takes w80 nuclear warhead . 
  so vindobona is a real place . 
  currently vienna ? 
  mindblown, 
  finland gets this all the time . 
  the international airzone is very narrow between estonia and finland . 
  i d be worried that the russian pilots drink too much vodka since they ca n't color inside the lines . 
  edit : here is the international airspace for reference .
