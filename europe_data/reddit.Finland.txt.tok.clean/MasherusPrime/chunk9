  http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article7431767.ece/alternates/w960/ilmatilaloukkaus+ilmatila.png edit : the planes hit that little dip south of `` porvoo '' . 
  that is the most common spot for these . 
  ( source in the next comment . 
  it is a lot more understable if you visit . 
  the shrines are everywhere , especially in mandalay . 
  some of them are very very small , think single parking slot . 
  also since the locals travel only for shrine visits , a lot of the hotels are close to the shrines . 
  foreign tourism was ** really ** limited before the opening . 
  literally the daily plane had 8 white guys when i went there before the opening . 
  the airport was a shed from 50s . 
  it s like a time machine , go before it s too late . 
  maybe they decided that becoming belgium is not an option ? 
   what does that even mean in this context ? 
  that nobody wants to see the 98.3 % rejection rate result in the headline . 
  dw thinks it is one guy : http://www.dw.com/en/refugee-friendly-german-mayor-beaten-unconscious/a-35932558  the mayor of a small town in northern germany was beaten by an unknown attacker , likely over his plans to establish refugee housing in the area , authorities in oersdorf said on friday . 
  mayor joachim kebschull , 61 , lost consciousness and had to be taken to a local hospital after he was hit over the head with a blunt instrument on his way to a town planning meeting . 
   six officers were on duty to guard the meeting , but that ** the perpetrator ** exploited the brief moment when the mayor disappeared out of sight to collect his laptop from his car . 
  mig21bis is still a relatively relevant platform , despite being old . 
  having 7 planes only is not a lot though . 
  not much can be done with that number , so it would n't matter if those 7 are f35s or su35s . 
  there are several levels in the conscription system ( edit : in finland . 
  ) : - armed service - armed service b class for slightly limited soldiers - weaponless service in army barracks . 
  no guns involved . 
  - civilian service . 
  general purpose helping the society in hospitals , like carting grannies between the wards in wheel chairs . 
  - total refusal . 
  used to be jailtime , but now i think mostly ankle bracelet - medically not fit for service . 
  bad atopic skin , mental disorders , certain religions ( jehova ) get freedom from service . 
  ( the news is about sweden though , not sure why we are talking about finland ... ), 
  you mean the 2nd bailout ? 
  the 1st bailout happened with the aid package when the greek debts were not cancelled . 
  edit : my meme-game is not up to date it seems . 
  on more serious note , all the talk about common army is useless if the member states do not start to invest in their armies . 
  currently the eastern bloc is in soviet state . 
  the western bloc is downsizing w germany/netherlands/sweden in the lead . 
  only large countries with lots of weaponry/investment are the greeks and poles . 
  ( and maybe french ) here is a map : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?view=map, 
  italy 's vision : if losing , just change side . 
  no need for removals . 
  just posting the link so people will know the downvotes are for reposting , not due to perceived r/europe neonazi conspiracy .

  crotale missfires ( apparently ) . 
  hard to see the scabbards buying another critical system with reliability problems . 
  we passed the french in all of the asrad , stinger , umkontho and nasams purchases . 
  4 systems , all have good french options on paper . 
  none selected . . we cant buy russian . 
  except the ukranians could modify the old buk to resist the russians . 
  this was done for the georgia , who got frags with the buks in ossetia . 
  nasaam has a weak radar , but finland has one of the better military radar networks in europe . 
  maanpuolustus.net seems to think finland might not be buying french missile systems after crotale . 
  apparently the quality of craftsmanship has not been great . 
  edit : yes , you aright . 
  it was one of the 2 finalists . 
  http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/jattimainen-ohjuskauppa-ratkeaa-lahiaikoina/1952764 also apparently we tried to get the patriot , but that did n't work . 
  yea , the missile is getting replaced in the us . 
   in 2007 , the army terminated the atacms program due to cost i suppose we ll buy the next version , out in 2022 . 
  this capability ( long range carrier ammo ) is part of the mine replacement program for ottawa land mine treaty . 
  something is getting bought for the heavy rocket launchers . 
  the preparation for the army deployment is an existential warfare , with 200k medium quality armor troops . 
  nobody is expecting the airspace to be in finnish control , that s why we have manpads for days . 
  the problem with the aa systems is that the better ones are only sold to nato members . 
  or you can buy from russians . 
  my monies are buying a chinese/korean system in a few years when they catch up . 
  korean s400 seems very attractive . 
  this system was introduced in 2007 . '', 
  as of september 2013 , the russian armed forces had five s-400 regiments : two in moscow , one in the pacific fleet , one in the baltic fleet ( kaliningrad ) , and one in the southern military district . '', 
  afterwards : crimea , syria , novosibirsk ... they even sold this to india and china before putting in st. pete . 
  finland is not a high priority threat , otherwise they would have deployed before covering novosibirsk . 
  if finland the aa is around large cities and near the border . 
  seeing zero problem in this . 
  welcome to life with unstable neighbours . 
  finnish solutions are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-154_joint_standoff_weapon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mgm-140_atacms the mgm140 is `` on hold '' , so apparently we might buy something similar in a couple years . 
  why did russia not abstain on 1483 ? 
  why did russia specifically vote for execution of that resolution ? 
  come one man , try a bit . 
  when does the un security council ok crimean invasion ? 
  1483 explicitly states that iraq is under us control . 
   there was nothing to veto . 
  could have vetoed this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1441 or this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1483 i mean , russia ok stamped us as ruler of iraq . 
  gg , now go hide in shame . 
  edit : resolution 1483 : 14 voted for none voted against none abstained, 
  as a russian , are n't you a little ashamed that you did n't un veto this exercise ? 
  could have saved us all a whole lot of trouble ... 
  debaathification was an us dod policy . 
  you can blame this mudcake for rumsfeld and wolfowitz ... 
  putting too many retards in one cabinet creates fun for decades . 
  i mean cutting the elite of one of the religious parties completely off their livelihoods , what could possibly go wrong ? 
  even better would be to get paid for trolling internet boards ... 
  hahaha . 
  we also support russian forces in syria . 
  now putin yourself out of that one . 
  so when did we invade afganistan ? 
  yes , never ... that is scrubbing us mess . 
  similar to the kurdish militia training op in iraq . 
  primeminister in finland ca n't authorize war participation in finland . 
  you know , not every country is a dictatorship like russia . 
  link sources or quit trolling . 
  putin child . 
  what does j\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki -  vanhanen scandal has to do with anything ? 
  quit linking rubbish and link either public support figures or the government authorization for that crapshoot .
