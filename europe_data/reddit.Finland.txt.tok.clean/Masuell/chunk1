we have n't won gold against any other country than sweden so you lose to us more in the finals than the others do . 
  logic . 
  tallinn , super chill place and cheap to go there , cheap to buy stuff too and cheap drinks . 
  perfect place for finns to go !, 
  although my favourite city would probably be some other one if i could travel further ... 
  oh you were in the flag thread right !, 
  yes and that 's only one of the particles added to the end of the word you 're going to get used to . 
  some of the particles like '' - han '' work similar to german or dutch modal particles and some like '' - kin '' can mean `` too '' , `` also '' , `` after all '' or even something different . 
  there 's a lot of fun stuff that works very differently than what you might be used to , have fun learning and remember that there are also parts that are easier , no articles or gender for example . 
  and the word it is added to will be reeled to the first spot of the sentence . 
  = that is a book . 
  = is that a book . 
  = is that a * book * * tuoko on kirja . 
  = is * that * a book basically the - ko goes to the word you are asking about and slingshots it to the first spot with exceptions in speech where it does n't jump up in order . 
  it has more rules !, 
  pronunciation of `` english '' for example in english is / ' \u026a\u014b\u0261l\u026a\u0283 / where you can see that it is / \u014b\u0261 / and not / \u014b\u02d0 / like in finnish `` kuningas '' / kuni\u014b\u02d0\u0251s / . 
  edit : not always of course , in words like `` king '' or `` sing '' it is only / \u014b / . 
  that 's why `` singer '' does n't have the g. 
  well in english you often pronunce the g after the `` ng '' sound too , so like `` english '' has an `` ng '' sound first and a g after it , most finns forget the g. and also finnish `` ng '' is a geminate sound ( longer in duration like kk pp tt ) . 
  those are the differences but still it should n't really be hard . 
  learning the language is n't gon na be any harder than learning english was . 
  maybe even easier as dutch and english have quite a lot of similarities . 
  however now you are gon na be in nl and it should be way easier to practise with natives , however like in many other countries where english is spoken well you might need to ask to speak dutch instead of english ( or so i 've heard , works like that here where i live too ) . 
  you should try to use dutch as much as possible and english only when absolutely needed if possible , that 'll make it faster to learn even if you have to check words from dictionaries and so on . 
  just a few tips on learning languages ( and dutch ) . 
  did some fun math , about 17 % of nl 's land area is reclaimed land . 
  that is about 5760 square km . 
  18,41 % is water area . 
  ( 41 543 sqkm x 0,8159 ) x 0,17 = 5762,14 sqkm . 
  now finland has glacial rebound that makes about 7 sqkm of land appear every year . 
  this means that in about 800 years finland has grown about as much into the sea as nl has . 
  800 x 7 sqkm = 5600 sqkm . 
  fun stuff . 
  also it seems to be somehow related to counsil of europe . 
  switzerland is not eu though and the earlier pic has them under eu flag too . 
  you are looking at the stockholm archipelago while it is part of the swedish east coast archipelago which is bigger at least by the count of islands ( maybe ) . 
  but the thing is where you draw the lines for the archipelagos on where they end and start , that is what causes the differences in these articles and so on . 
  we could settle on them being equally big . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ both ^ ^ ^ ^ finns ^ ^ ^ ^ ofc ^ ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ ^ archipelago ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ bigger ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ ^ beautiful ^ ^ ^ ^ pfffft . 
  from that article . 
   by some definitions it contains the largest archipelago ( island group ) in the world by the number of islands and now from the article for [ archipelagos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archipelago ) overall . 
   the archipelago with the most islands is the swedish east coast archipelago , which contains the stockholm archipelago , which , in turn , connects to the world 's second largest archipelago , the archipelago sea in finland . 
  and there is a [ list of archipelagos by amount of islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_archipelagos_by_number_of_islands ) too . 
  but these are only wikipedia sources now . 
  meh , our archipelago is surely more beautiful !, 
  second largest , the largest is on sweden 's side of the sea but still . 
  finnish allows for infinite compounds as well just like norwegian and german does . 
  the word in question is not a compound so i 'd say we beat you . 
  sweden has probably done something fishy to \u00c5land and bornholm i think . 
  i can already do that , i mean i wan na properly learn the language . 
  i 'm busy with some germanic languages right now but i wan na be able to speak the closest relative language to my native one . 
  ( well closest one that is at least relevant . ), 
  i do love you and your language and i think it 's always really chill to visit . 
  i wan na learn estonian at some point . 
  today was rather cold of course . 
  this time i was just fetching alcohol and showing places to my friends who had never been to estonia at all , can you believe that !, 
  we had just a day to do stuff . 
  : / the booze fetching usually is n't my main thing while there . 
  i also sell a lot of it to cover the costs of the trip so i can go to tallinn for free . 
  `` olen peloissani '' also works . 
  in speech you 'd go for something like `` auta/auttakaa , mua pelottaa '' . 
  btw coming from estonia right now . 
  you know why i went there . 
  north korea borders russia . 
  sweden does not border russia . 
  they 'd have to go through russia and then either finland or norway . 
  dutch plurals are kinda nonsensical at times . 
  :p ( just like english plurals . ), 
  at least be consistent with the translation language . 
  `` alanko '' could be better translated as `` low area '' in this context i think because `` lowlandlands/laaglandlanden '' sound stupid . 
  we could just do the same as with other countries/placenames . 
  kymri with a capitalised k being wales and kymri with a little k being the welsh language . 
  also `` kymrin/suomen kieli '' is not written together . 
  much of estonian vocab comes from low german and ( old ) swedish like randel said . 
  the reason it 's similar is obviously because swedish and dutch are so closely related . 
  bunch of the word endings are the same too really . 
  left is dutch and right is swedish . 
  - heid / - het - achtig / - aktig - lijk / - lig - baar / - bar - ig / - ig and buncha more i 'm pretty sure . 
  edit : in estonian the double i stands for a long i sound . 
  one i would be the same sound but shorter and the `` ij '' sound would be written like `` ei '' or '' \u00e4i '' in estonian i think . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_issues_concerning_the_euro there 's a table on how the euro mark is used . 
  in germany they put it after the amount like sensible human beings but in english and dutch you put it before the amount . 
  interestingly enough in austria , liechtenstein and switzerland they write it before the sum too . 
  the cross is obese . 
  and i really do n't get it why you have drying racks in other countries . 
  we have drying closets in all kitchens here in finland , not sure if sweden and other nordics have them too . . ? 
  no do n't get me wrong , i love estonia . 
  they are like the best lil bro you can have . 
  ( and our only relative , sob sob . ), 
  just saying they also have cheap alcohol . 
  and has cheap alcohol . 
  it 's umm ... weather ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ answer ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ question ? 
  you want all of us to die from alcohol poisoning then ? 
  how nice of you . 
  ohh well damn . 
  it seems to be so , my bad . 
  english is a mandatory language , you have no choice . 
  i could have chosen french before english but then english would 've started just a year later for me . 
  it 's mandatory .
