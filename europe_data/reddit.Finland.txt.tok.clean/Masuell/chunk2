  maybe changes have been made since your wife was in school but that information is not up to date . 
  nice , i tried to see them earlier too but ca n't see shit in helsinki with all the light pollution and bit of cloudiness , i 've seen them here before though . 
  also stayed up this long for the opener but got ta go sleep now , i 'm predicting the leafs just fuck it up now that i leave . 
  yep , and this is also why finns generally suck at swedish even though it 's also a mandatory language in school . 
  we just do n't need it like english . 
   somehow english is a hard language to learn for our people that 's not the case . 
  english is n't any harder for ukrainians . 
  it has more to do with the teaching and media . 
  the less you need the language the less people will speak it . 
  that 's why people in japan do n't speak english well even though their school system is alright . 
  you should drop * se * in both clauses . 
  finnish is a [ pro-drop language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pro-drop_language ) so instead of saying `` it 's 38 degrees '' you say `` is 38 degrees '' . 
  you probably would like to use the word * [ vasta ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vasta#adverb ) * instead of * vain * . 
  both are acceptable but * vain * does n't sound as natural i think . 
  you could also add * l\u00e4mmint\u00e4 * meaning just `` warm '' . 
  purely optional . 
  ; - ; if you need any help or resources just throw a pm whenever . 
  we also have great teaching . 
  ukraine is n't on the same level with that i 'd guess . 
  well honestly our `` mountains '' are just very large hills . 
  they are shitty fells . 
  in finnish `` riga '' is `` riika '' but if you say `` in riga '' it becomes `` riiassa '' . 
  i 'd guess something similar happened with estonian but those poor guys just forgot it 's not supposed to be like that in the base form . 
  you know how slow estonians are . 
  i 've visited the azores before . 
  honestly an awesome place . 
  rather different from most other places i 've been to . 
  also many of the germanic loans found both in finnish and estonian are from early low german because it was the language of trade for a long time . 
  i do n't think the language matters at all in this question though . 
  being more swedish \u2260 more nordic . 
   and something with a similar meaning in finnish `` pohjoismaat '' from pohjoinen ( north ) and maat ( maa = land/country ) . 
  so basically `` northcountries/northlands '' . 
  well they are n't `` proto uralic '' groups at all . 
  only the etymology of the word is proto uralic . 
  the northern dots are komi language and the southern dots are probably mordvinic languages and udmurt . 
  komi has something like 200 000 speakers , mordvinic ( erzya/moksha ) ~ 400 000 and udmurt about 350 000 . 
  yes i did . 
  just did n't specify . 
  basically it 'd do the same job as the \u00d6resund bridge except by rail . 
   english is just more limited in its vowels not true . 
  english has about as many vowels as dutch and more it actually has more diphtongs than dutch . 
  the vowel system in dutch and english is pretty similar anyways . 
  english spelling is just retarded while dutch spelling is pretty good . 
  additionally rp may have triphtongs . 
  do n't forget going to saunas . 
  saunas are life . 
  finnish words do n't natively have word initial consonant clusters so they are reduced to the last consonant of that cluster . 
  also f is not a native sound in finnish . 
  strand = ranta skruf = ruuvi sticka = tikku and so on . 
  _ kiiremini _ i guess is a cognate to _ kiireimmin _ . 
  do you know this ? 
  and the questions are pretty simple after all . 
  should really buy some small starter estonian book and just go through it and learn a few thousand words on my own . 
  i think that 'd be fun especially if i 'm going to bike through estonia to riga with my brother next summer . 
  so if i say _ sa oled roheline . _ would the question be _ kas sa oled roheline ? _ does _ v\u00e4 / v\u00f5i _ mean _ or _ ? 
  in spoken finnish you can also often ( not always ) leave _ - ks _ away and say _ vai _ in the end to make it a question . 
  [ well try this !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/xumfssijpko ), 
  how does that `` kas '' question thing work ? 
  i 've wondered about it for a while now but i do n't have many books about estonian and i do n't know if there are any good grammar sites for it online . 
  yes but you see with english you can write `` i can do this '' and it 's perfectly normal to say that too . 
  the difference in writing and speech is a lot bigger in finnish with a lot of differing grammar and a lot of sound change that has happened . 
  the dialects in english , swedish and dutch are in general a lot less different from the standard language . 
  ( except maybe some belgian dialects and ostrobothnian/other obscure swedish dialects . ), 
  finnish book language is an artificial creation and it is n't easy to speak in it at all . 
  it has a lot of features that are missing in speech and it also misses a lot of speech language 's features . 
  examples , first speech language and then book : menn\u00e4\u00e4n sy\u00f6m\u00e4\u00e4 . 
  let 's go eat . 
  do you want to eat an apple ? 
  ( s ) he 'll probably go do somethig else . 
  you go first . 
  ( really clunky ) do you have your id ? 
  it 's rather different , maybe elfdalian or ostrobothnian swedish dialects would be a fair comparison for it . 
  standard book finnish and spoken finnish are almost like separate languages though . 
  sometimes very different in vocabulary and grammar . 
  however you can also write spoken finnish with the same rules as the standard language so that 's great . 
   people of northern sweden those are basically ( forcefully ) assimilated sami and finns/finnic tribes . 
  well but you might say `` se meni koirineen jonnekin . '', 
  which uses the comitative case . 
  instructive/abessive/comitative are called marginal cases for a reason . 
  they are used less often . 
  den haag right ? 
  did n't you move there to study . 
  i have visited only once even though i speak dutch pretty well . 
  did n't get to try out all the foods that time . 
  i think i might go study there later as well but that 's not a thing to think about right now . 
  it could be stamppot too though . 
  have you tried kapsalon ? 
  it 's pretty much like their version of makkaraperunat . 
  not only that but sometimes the - s / - si imperfect is the exact same as conditional would be in my dialect . 
  like the imperfect of istua would be istu for me and the conditional would be istus/istuis ( would sit ) . 
  so `` i would sit '' is `` m\u00e4 istusin '' while in turku the exact same thing means `` i sat '' . 
  not 100 % sure since i do n't speak turkuish . 
  it 's not always just - i in standard finnish . 
  the imperfect for haluta is halusi . 
  in speech it 's usually halus both for people from turku and elsewhere . 
  nl does n't have a president and germany 's president is joachim gauck so both of those are incorrect . 
  all finns do n't exactly get a lot of practise so many of us speak rally english very well . 
  it 's just the finnish accent you get so it 's not really any more of a stereotype than any other accent . 
  yeah i guess [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yx4zkbthzcq/vlwopw747li/aaaaaaaavzy/zu23xv29rkk/s1600/poronk%25c3%25a4ristys2.jpg ) is what i expect when i think of sauteed reindeer .
