   france contributes a billion more despite being the same size economy . 
  germany contributes quite a bit more , even taking into account the fact that it 's economy is considerably larger . 
  but they are all within a fairly small deviation . 
  now if you 'd be a honest person you 'd admit you were wrong when you claimed that  with the rebate factored in , all the major economies are making a broadly comparable contribution to the budget and preferably cross over your incorrect statements . 
  i stopped reading here since you were n't a honest person . 
  sorry i do n't spend my time talking to dishonest liars . 
   with the rebate factored in , all the major economies are making a broadly comparable contribution to the budget no they are not . 
  that 's the opposite what your link says . 
  it says that germany made average of 9507 million euro net contribution , where as uk made roughly half of that in absolute sum with 4872m . 
  in gni proportion germany made 40 % higher contribution with 0.35 % of gni to the uk 's 0.25 % . 
  france made 5914m which is 21 % higher than uk 's , or a 16 % higher gni contribution . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   the rebate corrected this by bringing uk contributions into line with those of all the other advanced economies . 
  that 's not what these figures show . 
   now , you might make the case that the uk should pay proportionately more than anyone else more bullshit i rate your post 5/10 , a solid attempt at trolling . 
   it does show quite clearly why the uk budget rebate was n't some ` special privilege ' but something that was obviously required to make the whole thing reasonable . 
  how does it clearly show that ? 
  other countries do n't have a similar rebate so how is it not a special deal ? 
   figures do not include rebates ergo they intentionally used spin figures which they know are completely misleading and wrong , despite there being proper sums available . 
  what a shitty propaganda site . 
  personally i closed it right there since it is n't information . 
  did n't see a single source there for that claim , just some newspaper article from 10 years ago . 
  more importantly that does n't really change anything . 
  but everyone who can will , and that alone will cause transfer of wealth from here to some people who do n't deserve it . 
  so no thanks , it 's a horrible idea . 
  literally the comment i replied to says `` killing off older tech could enhance these companies ' competitiveness '' do you need me to bold it for you . 
   furthermore ** killing off ** older tech could enhance these companies ' competitiveness , assuming evs are the future ** killing ice vehicles ** fast would also mean giving ** eu ** automotive a headstart in the race for the change . 
  or kill car exports completely . 
  it 's only local news if the attacker is n't local . 
   when people say the science is settled they 're referring to climatology ( as i was ) the claim that climate science issues are political does n't make sense , because the political system does n't make decisions on climate change . 
  it makes policy decisions . 
  what 's actually being asked here when people suggest to ban fossil fuels , is to impoverish thousands of millions of people , to condemn thousand of millions people to early death . 
  to cause millions dead children and babies . 
  and that 's just one of the many factors leading to political decisions on it . 
  i find that this rhetoric pisses a lot of people off , but as it 's true it should n't . 
  it 's rather product of their denialism . 
  which is worse ? 
  just like before i certainly do n't know , and that should mean that i should n't make opinion about it either . 
  the only way you can have reason based opinion about this as well is through research . 
  most people have n't done anything like that either . 
  yet they have opinion about it . 
  no i still mean to disagree with that . 
  effect in things such as impact in agriculture , economy , migration can be seen as scientific issues . 
  there 's also no conclusion if and when co2 capturing from the atmosphere becomes possible , and there probably wo n't be , but that 's not a non-major scientific issue or is it ? 
  my point is n't to question that it exists or to imply there would be a scientific issue whether climate change exists or not , in the form more or less as described by reports such as ipccs . 
  i certainly would n't be someone who could draw conclusion about the first ( existence ) and not really the second either ( whether it 's a scientific issue ) . 
  i assume we agree the problem in the first place is that people draw conclusions from matters they have n't done any real research about , and that certainly is n't limited to this subject . 
  perhaps what i 'm trying to say is that i do n't think existence is the only scientific issue . 
  and rather it 's probably correct to say there 's no scientific issue whether climate change exists as more or less as described in some reports such as ipccs , but that ca n't be extended much further . 
  i also do n't necessarily think the whole issue is that people think there is n't a established fact in whether it exists or not . 
  i think people will draw different conclusions from it . 
  i do n't think all people think it really matters . 
  is n't that something subjective based on your values ? 
  does that make sense ? 
  you should imo correct the figure so it does n't mislead people . 
   i have n't really followed climate science debate for a few years as the remaining major issues are political rather than scientific . 
  you hear this so often but what exactly do you mean by this ? 
  but that says 80 % ? 
  nothing like 40 % what you claimed earlier ? 
  there is no higher demand as long as demand does n't exceed current supply . 
  here it 's a popular scam people fall into , but i do n't think it has any impact on production . 
   renewable sources by 2050 . 
  those are just political promises by people who know they wo n't be in charge or have any negative consequences to their life when it does n't come true . 
  none , it would be a technical disadvantage . 
  it was never implied there would be any advantage to it , that was purely your invention . 
  but as long as they are in the same system you ca n't really say that `` electricity to electric cars comes from green sources '' . 
  that 's nothing but a marketing ploy which you have fallen into . 
  imagine if almost all our schools taught popular beliefs without any scientific basis , despite the terrible outcomes from it in the past . 
  i really do n't see why reddit cares what the pope thinks anyway . 
  not that i necessarily disagree with him . 
  thanks for upholding this rule . 
  because it tells nothing about where the rest comes from . 
  the concerning part is how figuring this out seems to be so hard for so many . 
  most energy coming from wind does n't guarantee low emissions . 
  the post you replied to does n't say anything like that . 
  i never implied that you ca n't support it on the necessary evil basis . 
  the post i replied to sets the context , the context was about the basis for conscription , where the only valid one is the necessary evil argument . 
  my post talks about attitudes and the process of thinking that exists here . 
  i see that you could n't help but to extend the leg . 
  you try telling this to finns for example in / r/suomi and you 'll be downvoted to oblivion . 
  i know because i 've tried . 
  most of finns including the youth are very narrow minded in this aspect . 
  all they know what the situation is right now , and since the belief has been implanted to them since they were young , they just ca n't draw a new conclusion from evidence or logic . 
  any argument you 'll present to finns against mandatory services will draw this emotional knee-jerk reaction of hate , something i think most people are n't even aware of in conscious level - and the argument is then dismissed without a fact based analysis . 
  arguing against mandatory service type society is one of the guaranteed methods to get you hated here . 
  it 's basically a taboo subject in finland . 
  just watch this post get downvoted . 
  well yeah there exists/existed a lot of conspiracy theories about it and the article only touches them a little bit . 
  there 's clearly a pattern with uncommon events/disasters like this and conspiracy theories . 
  i guess people find it so unbelievable they start making up their own theories about it , but that is n't a rational process . 
  seems extremely silly , as if economic development can be predicted to the year 2100 . 
  for example developments in things like [ share of labor in agriculture ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ourworldindata_share-working-in-agriculture-since-1300.png ) , the internal combustion engine and information technology have completely altered the economy in the last 85 years . 
  energy however has surely been a large sector for this entire duration . 
  if we give up fossil fuels and rather use something like solar for energy that is [ far more available ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/solargis-solar-map-world-map-en.png ) elsewhere than in north . 
  it 's coming to here too . 
  our development since 08 is similar . 
  no one said painting a sign was comparable to killing someone . 
  that quote says nothing about painting a sign being the comparison . 
  finland is a pathetic story ever since 07 . 
  you have to pay fees to use roads ?
