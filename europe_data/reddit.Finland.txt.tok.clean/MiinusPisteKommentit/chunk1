[ 15:02 uct ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wyabvgh.png ) it has been like 5 times harder to destroy the french than it would have been to annex other land . 
  once again europeans have managed to spend most of their efforts fighting each other . 
  the eu flag effort compared to national flags represent the enthusiasm people have for the eu quite adequately . 
  thats not any different to how the donald supporters see themselves . 
  who is this linux shell ? 
  can you tell me more about him , i 've always wanted to learn . 
  you must be a very high level it technician , i mean it 's not every day you get to meet a man of your caliber . 
  you gave that answer like you were told those exact arguments in school , but have you put any thought into it yourself ? 
  the argument that politicians vote based on some research they themselves do is just not there . 
  by observing voting patterns you will realize politicians vote based on what their party lines stand for , or what the government program says if they are in government . 
  opposition politicians then have a bias for voting against these proposals for various reasons like getting more votes from dissatisfied people . 
  where 's your research and argumentative decision making here ? 
   who can spend the whole day learning about the pros and the cons of that issue , read academic reports , all you are doing is supposing they do that , but why even bother with that since you have vote what your party stands for anyway ? 
   i highly doubt that an average person forms his opinion after reading the reports of the lse or karolinska institut on currency union and neither does average politicians , so that 's a null argument . 
   they will read newspapers like all those beauty queen contest winners , javelin throwers , hockey player read their financial times and economist ? 
  they 've spent their youth understanding arguments presented in papers about currency unions ? 
   not to mention that more often than not , mps are better educated than the average population . 
  to a certain extent that 's correct , but what a coincidence that you conveniently miss out on answering the second question entirely . 
  so why would politician vote for interest of their people ? 
  what 's the incentive there ? 
  getting re-elected is about being popular , not about voting well , and for that you need to appear in media . 
  that 's mainly archived with money , and to get money you vote for what people with money want you to vote for . 
   asking a public of which 80 % or more have no realistic understand of currency unions . 
  what makes you think that politicians have better knowledge about them , or why do you assume they make decisions aiming for the best interest of the people based on that knowledge ? 
  requesting a gif of this . 
  that 's the most stupid thing i 've heard . 
  i guess if you search population of france you type `` population of entire france '' . 
  a reasonable person expects the figures in this chart to present the flows to and from the rest of the entire eu/efta area , since that 's what the title implies to a reasonable person . 
  now it 's up to you to decide if you want to be an reasonable person or not . 
  have a good day . 
  it does n't matter that the countries are within eu/efta , it 's not titled `` flows between ** some ** countries in eu/efta '' . 
  there 's again a difference between some countries of eu/efta and `` within the eu/efta '' . 
  the title was latter and incorrect . 
  besides do i understand correctly that within 20 minutes you 've changed your reason ? 
  first you argue it is n't incorrect because it 's an attempt , when that does n't hold any water you suddenly jump to argue something completely different . 
  how does that even happen , how do you rationalize that to yourself ? 
  no it 's not . 
  for future reference here 's the meaning of attempt :  make an effort to achieve or complete ( something difficult ) . 
  you have n't done that . 
  you have not made an effort to get figures for eu/efta between countries movement . 
  what you have done is knowingly posted information that does n't represent that , even when correct or better information is available . 
  it 's incorrectly titled , there 's nothing more to it . 
  ** here is an attempt ** to get right figures for finland : finland 2014 eu/efta movement : * + 15378 * - 10109 source : [ stat.fi ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/muutl/2015/muutl_2015_2016-05-17_tie_001_en.html ) i attempted , you did n't . 
  you posted wrong information for the title . 
  there 's a difference between attempting and knowingly spreading wrong information . 
  so if it does n't include all eu/efta countries as source countries , it ca n't be titled `` migration flows within the eu/efta '' because it is n't that . 
  now it 's just incorrect . 
  it does n't imply that . 
  it said that you need to rationalize not caring about your biologic kids . 
  you made up the part about not loving adopted kids entirely by yourself . 
   the decision ... falls to its guardian ergo the child is n't consenting to anything . 
  where was anything of that sort written ? 
  nowhere to me . 
  what else is that `` nationals accounted for over 70 % of sex crimes '' when some groups are up to 16x and 14x over represented in rape crimes ? 
  what insight do you have , nothing i assume ? 
  i divided the problem not on the end results but rather different factors . 
  this was a basic issue you should have been able to grasp . 
  different problems require different solutions . 
  the dutch ca n't into low mercury master race . 
  sorry i forgot to take into account your flair + position on brexit and so to explain the basics of what efta is about . 
  it 's now edited in so you can learn why it does n't quite work as a comparison . 
  norway is an efta country . 
  indeed if you accept efta rules , meaning for starters majority of eu 's regulation and the very same eu 's free movement of people rules you vehemently voted against , then indeed it can be relatively painless . 
  he actually had something to say ( either invalid or valid ) about the wikileaks reference for example . 
  but the journalist ( or the video editor ) does n't quite let him explain himself . 
  it seems to be a lot about his poor ability to express his thoughts in english . 
   higher intelligence/education is generally better for surviving what exactly do you mean ? 
  citation perhaps ? 
  average lifespan is somewhat higher i assume , but that does n't mean better reproductive success , which i assumed you meant by fitness . 
  why do you assume the fitness of antievolutionary people to be lower ? 
  this is n't a good comparison of size but of latitude . 
  this map is not a measurement of inequality . 
  nice strawman you have going on for you . 
  and what did you base the claim there 's no proof on ? 
  with the real `` advantage '' of the eu being that people with political connections get their saving parachute and every other industry and person suffers from it . 
  where as in this made up reality the key industry being lower technology manufacturing segment , in detriment to higher technology where actual stuff is made from the steel . 
  / r/europe sure likes poverty imposed by trade bans . 
  that 's not an adequate level of detail required to explain gibraltar 's economic strength . 
   because they do n't want to be under spanish authority ? 
  i can see why this would be the case right now , but i do n't think it will necessarily always be the case in future . 
  historical reasons definitely exist , but economic reasons are probably a better indicator of which side to support on issues . 
  why would spain be internationally condemned ? 
  * no arguments for the opinion * complaining about a spelling error, 
   i do n't see them ever accepting spanish sovereignty and why is that ? 
  can you see a difference between the last 30 years and the coming years ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  i do n't disagree , but i do n't think the negative sides should be glossed over either , like addiction to a site like facebook , youtube , or reddit . 
  for example https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kww189  our results showed that overall , the use of facebook was negatively associated with well-being . 
  what i like to do instead is add some fuel to the fire . 
  watching people absolutely lose it provides good entertainment . 
  nice way to circle yourself in the bubble . 
  lets analyze your meltdown :  edit : you are not ready for the truth . 
  ambiguous statement with no subject matter . 
   so you keep downvoting me for a thought crime . 
  self-victimization and a straw-man argument . 
  downvoting you does n't require anyone to think you have committed a thought crime , or to support any ideology that could be classified as a support for thought crimes . 
   interesting the downvoting is n't surprising and therefore not interesting , but your meltdown , if not interesting , is at least entertaining . 
   especially considering that you are all so liberal . 
  use of an ad hominem . 
  whether the voters are liberal or not is not relevant .
