unemployed violent criminals with drinking problems do n't contribute much to the society i 'm benefiting from . 
  speaking as a finn , i 'd be up for deporting all the `` immigration skeptics '' who turn up in kkk robes to throw stones , and moving the refugees into their apartments . 
  that 'd be a massive upgrade . 
  in the uk , there 's generally a perverse unexpected correlation between the beer being expensive and the pub being shit . 
  if you 're in a decent pub it 's generally cheaper , if you 're somewhere awful it 's more expensive . 
   that makes me wan na red the book . 
  success !, 
  my favorite one is the [ short story collection ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/b002ri9szg/ ) . 
  tove 's girlfriend tuulikki also showed up as tuutikki/tooticky in that midwinter one where moomintroll wakes up halfway through hibernation . 
  and yes , they 're not exactly * the faraway tree * . 
  some quotes : * * `` but that 's how it is when you start wanting to have things . 
  now , i just look at them , and when i go away i carry them in my head . 
  then my hands are always free , because i do n't have to carry a suitcase . '' * * * `` it 's funny about paths and rivers , '' he mused . 
  `` you see them go by , and suddenly you feel upset and want to be somewhere else -- wherever the path or the river is going , perhaps . '' * * * `` they were always doing something . 
  quietly , without interruption , and with great concentration , they carried on with the hundred-and-one small things that made up their world . '' *, 
  and then you read the books again as an adult and instead of being scared of the groke you 're just sad for her . 
  . . and suddenly everything in those books is sad and wistful . 
  autumn 's coming on , i feel like curling up under the covers and rereading them by candlelight . 
  he was talking about 20 % of the world 's population . 
  europe is like 8 % . 
  we seem to be counted a lot of the time . 
  i do n't understand why people do n't just talk about the nordics , though . 
  it 's even shorter . 
  and `` fennoscandinavia '' literally means `` finland and scandinavia '' so it 's a bit pointless . 
   the hunters who pay good money to hunt down an animal , almost always past breeding age and close to their average maximum life span and from the article :  now we have to give up for dead his six cubs, 
  that 's some bloody amazing landscape videography . 
  makes the prize-winning work on top gear look a bit shonky by comparison . 
  austerity is an excellent way to slow down economic recovery . 
  finland never used anything smaller than a 5c coin . 
  i do n't know why anyone did . 
  unless your values go against the dominant monoculture . 
  i know a few people who live way out in the sticks , and they have to suffer with molasses internet like 10 or 20 down . 
  i 've never heard of anyone having to put with 5 down in the last . . decade or so . 
  i hope the uk decides to leave the eu , but scotland decides they want to stay . . and northern ireland . . and cornwall . . and wales . . and the republic of yorkshire . . 
  lots of cameron trying to kiss up to obama or get people to think they 're mates , to make himself look like less of a national embarrassment . 
  that 's about it . 
  no potato , only * high-speed broadband internet * . 
  i 'd be up for a nordic union to start with . 
  ( scotland and estonia welcome . ), 
  in addition to their other activities , the lapd have traditionally been the go-to bagmen and enforcers for organized crime in the area . 
  conversely , most street gangs were started to protect poor neighborhoods from criminals , in the absence of a meaningful police presence . 
  just . . wherever . 
  there is n't that much of a split into exclusive gated communities and nasty ghettos . 
  this could be a problem in places like mexico , russia , or la , where the police are just another heavily armed drug gang . 
  in places like scandiwegia , not so much . 
  tallinn , estonia is pretty hipstery . 
  it 's been years since i 've been , but i was lost in a sea of buddy holly glasses , scarves and macbooks . 
  * it can be two things *, 
  our local one bought out a local butcher ( who were cheap and excellent quality ) so they could go on reselling their product for 200-300 % of the price . 
  you prefer * stockmann * ? 
  how posh are you ? 
  whenever i got into stockmann it 's all 50-70yo ladies wearing furs and hats . 
  tuna flake is surprisingly okay on pizza . 
  i never ask for it but if someone makes a pepperoni pizza with tuna under the pepperoni i 'll have a slice . 
  i have n't seen it since i was a kid . 
  people tend to use canned pasta sauce now , if they 're not just straight up buying one of those pizza kits with a wad of dough and a little jar of pizza sauce . 
  finns were the go-to `` oh , a violent crime , it must be one of those immigrants '' for a long time . 
  they were seen as problematic , drunken , unemployed unskilled laborers , by and large . 
  is the compartment by the back porchy thing a sauna ? 
  i went looking for pictures of saunas actually on board finnish navy vessels , but all i found was the [ finnish naval academy 's sauna ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/merisotakoulun_sauna.jpg ) on land . 
  lakeside property to build your sauna on , anywhere near a human being is $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ . 
  cut out the middleman by getting out onto the lake instead . 
  and , of course , it has to be by or on the water so you can run out of the sauna and jump into the lake , then run out of the lake and jump into the sauna , and repeat as often as is unnecessary . 
  the classic `` i spend all my time on the internet , watch movies without subtitles , maybe read novels in english , but speak it maybe once every five years '' finnish accent . 
  my fella keeps a blog in english but talks like that . 
  we were technically not beholden to them , but in practical terms with the yya deal etc. 
  we were pretty well on a leash . 
  in what way is finland not eastern europe ? 
  it 's literally on the eastern border of europe and if you go south in a straight line from kouvola you go through belarus and the ukraine . 
  that 's not bad . 
  trees and everything . 
  looks quite nice really , with the sun and snow . 
  i see a lot of probably-african bus drivers and construction/road workers around . 
  i keep seeing , like , indian and afro-caribbean people around chatting to each other in somewhat fractured but easily comprehensible finnish . 
  learning finnish to the standard where you could draft press releases is impossible , learning finnish to the standard where you could use it at work in an everyday fashion is n't that tough . 
  the kia * was * cool and young and futuristic when it came out , as a conventional petrol vehicle , a decade ago . 
  `` cool and young and futuristic '' is not a look that ages well . 
  [ four lions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c17iowr.gif ) is the best depiction thus far of the majority of people who join daesh/al-qaeda/the ira/the nordic resistance movement/etc, 
  [ when it 's time to party we will party hard ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article6559529.ece/alternates/w960/juoppo%20humala%20alkoholi%20sammunut%20alkoholiongelma%20syrj%c3%a4ytyminen.jpg ), 
  you 'll have to start building those dikes higher soon , mind . 
  the netherlands in 2015 vs the netherlands in 2065 . 
  a song has to be catchy to qualify as really , really bad . 
  so was he stabbed by an asylum seeker or one of the local neo-nazis ? 
  george w. bush graduated from yale , and he still was n't that bright . 
  it 's easy to mistake dumb pretending to be clever for clever pretending to be dumb . 
  some men just want to see the world burn , others have no idea that actions have consequences . 
  boris is sometimes compared to trump , but he 's more emotionally mature and adult and even stupider and more clueless . 
  you should n't , except during economic booms . 
  during economic booms it 's necessary to keep them under control so they do n't lead to a bust and a recession , during recessions it 's necessary to goose the economy with well-placed infusions of liquid assets you 've saved up during the last boom . 
  generally speaking , governments do n't do either , and instead run the heating when it 's too hot and turn the air conditioning up when it 's too cold . 
  i 'll vote to join if estonia , denmark , and scotland are in . 
  it means someone who 's from urpala . 
  ( urpala is a small village that used to be in finland and is now in russia . 
  its name appears to be derived from the word `` urpa '' , which sounds like it could be a thing but is far too archaic and obscure to be known to me , if it is a word . ), 
  well , the uk at least . 
  it happened when boris johnson somehow became a factor in uk politics , the man being completely indistinguishable from a character from monty python or perhaps blackadder . 
  ( yes , prime minister would n't have had one that broad and implausible . ), 
  have i got news from you has a lot to answer for . 
  there 's a lot of gnarly dirt roads that are just set at the default 80k instead of being more carefully considered ; people do n't generally drive 80 on them . 
  except locals who know the road like the back of their hand .
