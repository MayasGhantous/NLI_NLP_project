right . 
  but the possible hit will be seen at the next elections . 
  the majority of finns still do n't want to join nato . 
  what 's so `` lol '' about it ? 
  it 's still almost a year until the elections . 
  well yeah , but this one is less known even among the finns . 
  edit : i mean that 's why i posted it . 
  not to understate the civil war . 
  especially the treatment and reckless tribunal of red prisoners has been quite a controversy . 
  in my opinion the whole thing is fairly well taught in schools , but i guess it varies . 
  ( judging by the other comments ), 
  finns set up [ concentration camps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_karelian_concentration_camps ) during the continuation war . 
  also [ this ] ( http://areena.yle.fi/tv/2252439 ) ( totally in finnish though ) is pretty funny . 
  actually most itsen\u00e4isyyspuolue interviews are great . 
  aaand we have a winner . 
  hipster from hungary , oh man . 
  this is horrible . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  what would be an interesting city to live in ? 
  ( in finland i mean ) or a pretty one at least ? 
  i 'd be surprised , though thoroughly impressed , if a group of teenagers had enough interest to organize political activism not to mention an uprising . 
  to me that sounds like they were either making stupid nazi jokes , or just a typical gang of idiots and bullies . 
  this sounds like a misunderstood ( tasteless ) joke . 
   and the poems that did n't make it into the kanteletar are in an online database over here : http://skvr.fi thank you for this !, 
  i have no idea what 's going on in most of them which is why they are so funny . 
  i love everything about this . 
  op 's question truly was a can of worms waiting to be opened . 
  we should convert them while we are at it !, 
  i do n't think anyone was claiming that it 's not suitable for inventing and producing things . 
  it 's not like we only use american smartphones , cars and planes though . 
  * many * , maybe yes , but also * many * from other countries . 
  clearly `` european capitalism '' is working as well , more or less depending on the country . 
  is ... is that from birdemic ? 
  and then took them away . 
  you made a flag from your chieftain 's suffering ? 
  does n't sound like it would bring you any luck . 
  totally metal though . 
  a tsar of course . 
  any recommendations for further reading about these `` clues '' of the old language ? 
   alcoholic \u0ca0_\u0ca0  relatives \u0298 \u203f \u0298, 
  fat ? 
  curvy and nourished  like she should be . 
  beautiful . 
  surely there must be a lithuanian folk metal band with bagpipes already ? 
  not even the one with symbol of lapuan liike ? 
  i approve . 
  edit : hungary should be independent from dem slavs . 
   finnish sounds a bit like russian . 
  * gasp * , this is too much ... you have been banned from / r/finnougric . 
  also the supposedly upcoming l\u00e4nsimetro , but that shit wo n't be finished before half life 3 . 
  c'mon , it would be the ultimate fallout experience !, 
  we had to pick 6 subjects . 
  fortunately we had 6 hours too , though it was barely enough . 
  oh , the summerset isles . 
  sweet . 
  we are one !, 
  ah , yet another finno-ugric dominated chart . 
  ^ except ^ for ^ hungary ^  :(, 
  and petsamo !, 
  you 're going too far . 
  i like it . 
  you did n't ? 
  all countries are relevant . 
  yeah , there 's more where that came from !, 
  i 'll be here all night . 
  well facists have been fans of neoclassicism , but so have plenty of others . 
  one could say that being a fan of certain art and architecture does n't define your political views . 
  latvia and lithuania can into finno-ugric ? 
  nice . 
  what the fuck ? 
  was that some sort of a passive aggressive insult ? 
  jeez , southern banter is surprisingly brutal . 
  gah , the name still irrationally annoys me to no end . 
  oh well , at least odin fits better in norway . 
  wow , i did n't even know there was such a myth . 
  how did that come about ? 
  'cause of the writings by yrj\u00f6 koskinen ? 
  well , there were at least [ anjala conspiracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anjala_conspiracy ) and of course the [ cudgel war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cudgel_war ) , but i would n't necessarily call them as uprisings against * sweden * . 
  ( ca n't say how strong the `` independence '' aspect was in the conspiracy , so i 'd appreciate if someone gave some insight into that ... ), 
  we ca n't afford to do that anymore . 
  there 's a welsh sub ? 
  excellent , i do n't know a word of it but it 's nice to look at . 
   also suprised that / r/suomi is so high up on the list . 
  ( and of course the list is lacking the glorious / r/finnougric ), 
  at least we get a new cool world map . 
  sure , it will be all wasteland ' y in reality , but we wo n't put that on the map . 
  yeah , that 's our thing alright ... 
  is n't it 200 words or so ? 
  http://www.histdoc.net/sounds/hungary.html  if we look for the number of common words , only ab . 
  200 words with counterparts in finnish can be found in hungarian ,, 
  it 's beautiful . 
  look at us go !, 
  one day we will get land back from russia !, 
  edit : we do n't actually want it though , it 's ruined . 
  anders chydenius was an advocate of economic liberalism ( among other `` progressive '' things ) and his pamphlet * the national gain * was published eleven years before wealth of nations . 
  apparently chydenius had a theory very similiar to invisible hand , but have n't read it myself . 
  i approve this statement . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ come ^ ^ ^ ^ join ^ ^ ^ ^ us ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ / r/finnougric , ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  * hhhnnngghn * ... so badass it hurts ...
