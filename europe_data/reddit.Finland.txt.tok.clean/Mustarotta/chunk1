genreally speaking : yes . 
  it 'd be a pleasure !, 
  it is possile that plane would be cheaper . 
  you really just have to compare what would be the cheapest way . 
   can i take a train or other transport instead of flying from germany to sweden to finland ? 
  ferries sail daily between sweden and finland,

  can anyone share the save game to remind me what the heck i was doing last time ? 
  that 's hannover . 
  no , the english are delusional . 
  as italians we are most certainly interested in any visions regarding our beautiful and rich homelands . 
  you abandoned me !, 
  well actually i might have slightly angered you by violating the treaty of tordesillas ... 
  you ca n't leave me d ;, 
  the war in congo is a necessary step on much larger plans . 
  ( i am running the hell away from europe ), 
  it is me indeed . 
  the serene republic of venice wishes luck for the brave and heretic germans fighting against the also heretic french menace . 
  we have all the paperwork for joining the empire prepared and missing just the signatures . 
  you know ... just in case . 
  yup . 
  lost a battle won the war . 
  i count that as undefeted . 
  good night as always !, 
  even though the french menace stands undefeted and the heretics slowly claim italy , venezia still stands . 
   does `` round 5 '' mean this is a new start at 1444 ? 
  if not , when does it start ? 
  is there a screenshot or savegame available to have a look at the map ? 
  5th session of the second game edit : [ map at the end of last session ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lswbaqc.png )  in singleplayer i usually play at speed 4 or 5 and then pause the game everytime i get too many popups at once . 
  this is obviously not possible in multiplayer , so how is this handled ? 
  speed 2/3 with no pausing  how many players do you expect to join / how many played last time ? 
  we began with around 50 and last time were down to something like 20-30  why teamspeak ? 
  is there an actual reason to be in teamspeak or is it just for some chitchat ? 
  easier communication , fun to hear others . 
  some people are there , some are not . 
  absolutely not necessary . 
  is the position of the governor of new sweden open ? 
  i ca n't name items or places in particular but we certainly have for example books and other items that we looted during the thirty years war and that ended up in churches and mansions around the country . 
  there 's a story about a group of finns who were on a trip in poland . 
  they enter an inn of some sort and when the innkeeper hears they are finns they quickly become the best friends . 
  after a few drinks the innkeeper announces how poland loves their finnish brothers but how those pesky swedes with their goddamn looting [ hakkapeliitta 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) could rot in hell . 
  the finns were very quiet after that . 
  well ... 
  it clearly is . 
  do n't you touch our flag !, 
  ~ ~ make catholics great again ! ~ ~ ** survive **, 
  i would say this is one of the primary reasons why ttip is bullshit . 
  finland and nazis ? 
  after soviet union told us to drive the germans out of the country as part of the peace deal . 
  finland and germany fought the lappland war during which the germans burned lappland . 
  and france and spain with their * heavy ships * still failing to defeat the glorious venetian navy . 
  [ the serene republic of venice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybevc-yztvu ) after the war for hungarian independence the republic of venice turnedr her eyes back to the sea , the source of the republic 's wealth and power . 
  trade posts were build in ragusa and the islands of crete and naxos to strenghten the republic 's grip on the trade flowing from asia . 
  the venetian navy also saw some improvements . 
  the unprecented speed the venetian arsenal can build ships means that there 's now no navy in the world that could rival the navy of the republic in the calm waters of the mediterranean sea . 
  the navy 's pride , the early carrack san vittorio , with the lion of saint mark flying on it 's mast , is respected everywhere from the the pillars of hercules to the shores of crimea and levant . 
  _ _ _ _ _ at the beginning of the year 1496 the doge enzo ermelli receives a delegation from the grand duchy of lithuania in the doge 's palace , located in the st mark 's square . 
  the grand duke kazimieras calls for the republic 's aid against the invading ottomans and muscovites . 
  shaken by the ottoman invasion to europe and worried by the expansion the muscovite principality the doge promises aid for the lithuanians and starts negotiations with the pope and duke of tirol to organize an attack against the ottomans . 
  the negotiations last for almost the a year but finally in december of 1496 the venetian army crosses from corfu into yanya . 
  but are they too late ? 
  one by one the ottoman and muscovite armies force their enemies to submission until only the italians in the balkans and ethiopia far in the south remain . 
  with the enemy armies now marching to deal with the italian invasion the troops start to lose their hope against such an overwhelming enemy . 
  the armies finally clash in the battle of kirkklise where the 68 000 soldiers of the italian alliance were attacked by the 80 000 ottoman and muscovite troops . 
  with great losses to both sides the italians manage to get an edge over their enemies and drive them over the bosphorus . 
  with the european side of the ottomans now under italian control and the ottoman and muscovite troops stuck in anatolia the italians begin to approach the ottomans with offers of peace . 
  how will this war change the borders of europe ... 
  i think my beatiful venice is actually 5th . 
  honorary member of the italy cool kids club . 
   also , italy being relevant . 
  i read that as irrelevant and was ready to get really mad . 
  in the defence of castille , they did pay subsidies to the venetian republic at the start of the war . 
  [ and the map of the world on 1st of january 1500 . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjmynt9.png ) not pictured : the entire european side of the ottomans is under the occupation of the italian alliance . 
  [ ** the serene republic of venice ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybevc-yztvu ) for the last quarter of the century the doges of venice have tried to establish their dominance in the trade of the eastern mediterranean . 
  the conquest of ragusa and the partition of the kingdom of naples between the republic and the papal state secured the adriatic sea under the control of the republic . 
  while the alliance with the italian states has required venice to participate in the messy affairs of the continent , it has also secured the venetian rear from the empire . 
  now the source of fear in the government of republic comes from the east , where the rising ottoman empire possesses a threat to the venetian possessions around the aegean sea . 
  while the turks have so far not tried to attack the republic they do greatly disturb the venetian trade in constantinople . 
  when the italians attack savoy and her french and spanish allies the republic was forced to stay out . 
  insted the venetians marched their armies into the heartland of the austrian archduchy to support the hungarian efforts for independence . 
  while their aim sounds noble the doge bertucci valieri hopes to secure one of the last remaining ports in the adriatic that potentially threaten the city of venice . 
  with the lands of austria under occupation of the republic and her allies the republic now turns her eyes into her navy , which shall now be her focus . 
  long live the republic !, 
  or this map ridiculous . 
  awesome night guys , see you next week !, 
  long live italy !, 
  i could join as venice . 
  most of people do n't really put too much thought into these kind of things . 
    when in reality , of course , the kremlin 's opinions are less than irrelevant to finland  unfortunately our politicians have ~ ~ usually ~ ~ ** always ** been a bunch of spineless worms . 
  for example our president mauno koivisto was too scared to support the independence of baltic states, 
  it really has absolutely no logic whatsoever . 
  can we add finland having a crisis wondering if he 's a thing ? 
  could be just about any coat of arms . 
  yup . 
  / r/eu4 hates this just as much, 
  somebody dust the germans . 
  looks like we might need them .
