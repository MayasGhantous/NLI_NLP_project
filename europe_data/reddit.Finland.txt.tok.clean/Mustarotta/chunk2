  in the end the same thing . 
  the finnish polar bear cavalry is coming for you . 
   unless something really odd happens and finland takes over the whole world who told you ? 
  / r/europeanfederalists / ? 
   the temperature in southern finland might rise to +2 ... +5 degrees next week noooo !, 
  i absolutely love snowfall no matter what direction it is falling from or how nice and fluffy it is . 
  i get some weird looks from people when saying that though . 
  snow just makes me so unreasonably happy . 
  would just like to point out that in finland all saints ' day , * pyh\u00e4np\u00e4iv\u00e4 * , is `` celebrated '' on a saturday between 31.10-6 .11 , this year on the 5th of november . 
   do finn kids get to do homeworks during the summer break ? 
  no homework for summer break nor any other break during the year . 
  finlandization . 
  as a gmt +2 resident i am more than happy to let russians host it again . 
  where do you live ? 
  i see them all the time in greater helsinki area . 
   thracian greeks to the turkish sultan !, 
    o sultan , turkish devil and damned devil 's kith and kin , secretary to lucifer himself . 
  what the devil kind of knight are you , that ca n't slay a hedgehog with your naked arse ? 
  the devil excretes , and your army eats . 
  you will not , you son of a bitch , make subjects of christian sons ; we 've no fear of your army , by land and by sea we will battle with thee , fuck your mother . 
    you babylonian scullion , macedonian wheelwright , brewer of jerusalem , goat-fucker of alexandria , swineherd of greater and lesser egypt , pig of armenia , podolian thief , catamite of tartary , hangman of kamyanets , and fool of all the world and underworld , an idiot before god , grandson of the serpent , and the crick in our dick . 
  pig 's snout , mare 's arse , slaughterhouse cur , unchristened brow , screw your own mother !, 
    so the thracians declare , you lowlife . 
  you wo n't even be herding pigs for the christians . 
  now we 'll conclude , for we do n't know the date and do n't own a calendar ; the moon 's in the sky , the year with the lord , the day 's the same over here as it is over there ; for this kiss our arse !, 
  i am with you . 
  using these symbols for political purposes can be banned but otherwise they should absolutely be allowed . 
  some oil would do just fine to sadden us less . 
  could we borrow carl philip ? 
  but it has a map in it . 
  seriously no maps in flags . 
  it 's not that hard . 
  i could give you the whole country but as my fellow countrymen probably wo n't agree , how about \u00c5land for tornedalen ? 
  if you get the islands you surely no longer need ruija ? 
  you are going to need a king from the swedish house of vasa ... ... which is extinct . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
   a nordic federation on the krona thanks but no thanks . 
  as a minister of ours put it in regards to the council : `` could n't fucking care less '' . 
  welcome to western democracy . 
  t\u0161ekki in finnish . 
  hands off of our pensioner home . 
  with the castle as a the ceremonial hq ? 
  sounds good to me . 
  how about helsinki ? 
  nice and close to the only potential front . 
  have us back please ? 
  from the article :  the country 's defence minister , jussi niinist\u00f6 , said he hoped the deal -- incorporating joint military training , information sharing and research -- would be signed before the us presidential election in november . 
    ...   the deal would provide a framework for increased cooperation between the armed forces of the two nations but would not involve any binding commitment for either country to come to the defence of the other . 
  booze pipe ? 
  unless someone has specifically something against it , i shall pick up the torch of the revolution and lead the commonwealth either into glory and freedom or partitioning and destruction . 
  you are not european country if you do n't have any african land . 
  the duchy of karelia will be there to bring glory to the oppressed karelians and talk crap about every other nation on earth . 
  or get crushed by the revolution . 
  we shall see . 
  karelia shall not be removed . 
  i am thinking either that or lorraine . 
  a century one way or another , nothing that enough men sacrified ca n't fix . 
  you are not doing that badly , are you ? 
  do you have the save download somewhere ? 
  i might join as some little worthless piece of crap if i can make it back home in time . 
  the thing is , there is no one nato budget that handles the entire defence , in which case it would make sense , but every nato country spends money on their own defence . 
  each come up with different solutions on how to ensure their defence . 
  some choose to rely on volunteers , some use conscription . 
  a simple percentage of gdp is not a good metric , as the same amount of many provides different amount of results depending on the country . 
  armies do n't function on money alone either . 
  they need soldiers as well and less and less people seem to be interested in military service . 
  what good does throwing money at military get if you have nothing to man it with ? 
  germany spends just shy of 40 billion dollars on her military . 
  to fulfill the nato 2 % goal they would have to almost double that . 
  does n't seem reasonable to me . 
  am i the only one here who thinks the 2 % goal is stupid ? 
  yup , they are emblems . 
  rightfully so . 
  how about karl xii ? 
  live here is hard . 
  very very very really accurate . 
  compensation for having to redraw our maps because of the territory changes and because our dear eastern neighbour loves to change her name . 
  there 's a button to become a spectator in the lobby . 
  i am a strong independent nation with 15 ** ,24 ** points , thank you !, 
  claiming the ** archbishopric of riga ** . 
  his excellency will serve his holiness the pope and guide the faitfuls of the baltic and nordic regions . 
  now we just need a pope ... 
  volunteers ? 
  as we have a thread talking about capitalization in different languages , i need to point out that banaani is not a name and therefore not capitalized . 
  it 's shit , but it 's our shit . 
  i am really sorry but because of the combination of the release of stellaris and the eurovion i wo n't be able to join . 
  i would like aragon . 
  i would n't mind at all . 
   which ever party has the most votes in helsinki , will have its mayor candidate nominated . 
  will ** most likely ** have its mayor candidate nominated . 
  just came back from voting for the first time . 
  a reasonable amount of young people seemed to be on the move , so i am hoping that the turnout will be high . 
  how long has the time period been called stormaktstiden ? 
  would n't stormakt kind of mean empire ? 
   also finland was not a very interesting nor important part of sweden , so i guess that 's another reason . 
  um ... \u00c5bo used to be the second largest city in all of sweden . 
  both of these languages sound familiar but make no sense whatsoever . 
  make finland \u00d6sterland again . 
  correct . 
  it occupies the same role , but it absolutely is not a coat of arms .
