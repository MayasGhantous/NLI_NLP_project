  it is an emblem . 
  exactly in heraldry . 
  nine different lions would look ridiculous . 
  consistency is good . 
  i am not quite convinced that bigger number is better in this case . 
  which makes sense considering russian 's viking roots . 
  as someone who is strongly against conscription , i would be okay with this . 
  is it ? 
  interesting . 
  i guess we should adopt it in finnish , makes much more sense than maaliskuu . 
  the karelian `` kev\u00e4tkuu '' means `` spring month '' in finnish , and i would guess the same in karelian . 
  k\u00f6ttbullar from ikea is the best thing money can buy . 
  it 's called cross-country skiing and it happens to be the only real form of skiing . 
  i would n't except you southeners to know about it . 
  sweden is just trying to make sure that the damn norwegians ca n't get in . 
  too soon . 
  why is the finnish city named after the swedish dynasty ? 
  whereabouts in finland would this be ? 
  i have never heard this word in the south . 
  how about kalmar union ? 
  i mostly agree with you but monarchy is n't really in any way a problem for democracy . 
  it is a dashed line . 
  meaning that according to google crimea is a contested territory . 
  let 's leave the mustaches but the uniforms are nice . 
  that 's a very nice dam you have there . 
  it would be shame if something were to happen to it ... 
  we have absolutely nothing even remotely similiar to this . 
  even tallinn has walls ... all we got is moose . 
  we should just start dumping land in there to show the norwegians who has the mountains . 
  because it actually tells you how the words are pronounced . 
  fair enough . 
  is this sarcastic or am i just dumb ? 
  time to assemble the hakkapeliittas then . 
  and i was hoping you would be an example for our government ... 
  there 's no martys without muderers . 
  why do n't they love us :(, 
  could we please wait until december ... 
  yes . 
  we have a difficult relationship with independence . 
  make germany great again !, 
  as an avid / r/eu4 player i can say that he knew exactly what he was doing . 
  if helsinki is excluded the rest of the capital region has very neutral accent . 
  the only normal accent is in \u00d6sterland . 
  24th of december vs december 24th, 
  where abouts ? 
  i am assuming you are referring to [ the throne of alexander i during the diet of porvoo in the national museum ] ( http://viovio.puheenvuoro.uusisuomi.fi/sites/default/files/domain-1854/kuvat/valtaistuin-p.jpg ) and to [ the replica of the planned crown built in the 90s ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/king_of_finland%27s_crown2.jpg ) . 
  you know they will at least try . 
  but it is legal in most of europe ... ? 
  according to a story some swedish ship was sailing in the baltic and their fish had gone bad . 
  they sold it to finns residing in the turku archipelago . 
  next year when the ship returned the finns asked for more . 
  the swedes got curious and decided to taste some . 
  and thus surstr\u00f6mming was born . 
  almost perfect !, 
  who would voluntarily try to learn this language ? 
   you are slowed down estonian , and estonian you are slowed down latvian . 
  you are as honorary member latvians . 
  a word about finland : if an eu army was created finland would join in an hearthbeat . 
  we are dead afraid of being left out . 
  and swedish in finland . 
  this is the most accurate one so far . 
  i am assuming you just forgot about the balears . 
  [ my suggestion ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xdj5i7d.png ), 
  we do desperately need a fixit , regardless of who leaves and who stays . 
   what benefits do you get from being a member of the church , kek ? 
  perhaps all the stuff the church does for it 's members ? 
  iirc one of the most important reasons why people decide to remain members of the church despite not being religious is so that the will get a church funeral when the time comes . 
  no , church tax is collected only from members of said church . 
  do n't want to pay ? 
  resign from the church . 
  want to get the benefits of being member of the church ? 
  pay your taxes . 
  coat of arms of poland-lithuania up there . 
  that might be the symbol of the french republic , but it is not a coat of arms . 
  it is an emblem . 
  definitely him . 
  for the home of the holy, 
   teach children that religion/islam is bullshit in school most of what you listed is very reasonable , but this stands out . 
  there is no need to call religions bullshit , and certainly no reason to teach that to children . 
  what is needed is comprehensive and neutral religious education which covers the basics of the child 's own religion , it 's beliefs and history , and which helps the children understand other religions . 
  religions are not going anywhere and children need to be prepared to face people with different beliefs to theirs and know how to act in such situations . 
   the russian era interrupted the complete adaptation of finland to the swedish realm . 
  i am going to have to disagree with this particular line . 
  in 1809 , and even centuries earlier , finland was a fully integrated part of the swedish empire . 
  what russia annex was as much sweden as uppland and sm\u00e5land . 
  russia took and started integrating an important and integral part of sweden proper . 
  since when is anything in this country done according to the will of the people ? 
  why is finland not in nato ? 
  because our politicians have no guts . 
  `` may need '' ? 
  it most definitely does . 
  i am not sure if the nordics want to have anything to do with the uk considering the direction it is going . 
  too warm ca n't sleep . 
  we know , we know ... 
  what utter bullcrap . 
  i doubt norway will even think about it as long as they have their oil . 
  it 's the most beautiful thing i have ever seen . 
  there is absolutely no need for anyone who does not hunt to own any kind of gun anywhere in finland .

  okay i am not making myself clear enough : i am trying to joke that believing in a god has nothing to do with the church membership .
