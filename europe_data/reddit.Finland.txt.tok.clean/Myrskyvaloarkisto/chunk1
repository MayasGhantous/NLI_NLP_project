how ? 
  i know you 're joking , but this makes no sense . 
  how is finnish cuisine any more barbaric than other european cuisines ? 
  jokes usually have at least some basis in reality , but you just pulled this one out of thin air . 
  we actually got the ` kerta ' part in yksin-kerta-inen from a baltic language . 
  it was ` kerd\u0101 ' in proto-baltic and it evolved to ` k\u0101rta ' in modern latvian . 
  apparently we do : https://www.urbaanisanakirja.com/word/enkkeli/, 
  that 's a compound noun , it means `` living pictures theater '' . 
  elokuva is a shortening of ` el\u00e4v\u00e4t kuvat ' ( living pictures ) just like the english ` movie ' is a shortening of ` moving pictures ' . 
  so it 's like ` movie theater ' , but written without a space in between : movietheater .

  no , - tta is rarely used with nouns and never with pronouns . 
  it 's mainly used with verbs , e.g. 
  juoksematta = without running . 
  kaa and kanssa mean the same thing , they 're postpositions . 
  kaa is cognate with estonian - ga , and comes from ` kanssa ' . 
  though it is probable that the finnish kaa will become a full case in the future . 
  it 's not a true case yet , it 's in developement . 
  it 's currently closer to a postposition than a case , except in some eastern finnish dialects where it already agrees with vowel harmony . 
  kaa is not used in standard finnish , but it is very common among dialects . 
  we do have another ( archaic ) comitative case , but it can only be used in the plural : ` yst\u00e4vineen ' . 
  well , we do n't say `` bussinkaa '' because that would mean `` in the company of a bus '' . 
  you ca n't be in the company of a bus because busses are n't living things . 
  `` bussilla '' does n't mean `` on a bus '' but rather `` using a bus '' because the - lla case in finnish is also an instrumental case . 
  similiarly , we do n't say `` helsinginkaa '' because you ca n't be in company of helsinki . 
  it 's a city . 
  we can say `` yst\u00e4v\u00e4nkaa '' , though , because you can be in the company of a friend . 
  most cases correspond to prepositions in english , though . 
  they 're not complicated or special at all . 
  11 of the cases match to * in ; from ; into ; at , on ; from on top of ; onto ; as ; into ; with ; without ; together * in english and the rest 3 are just nominative , genitive/accusative and partitive . 
   school that 's your problem . 
  my father , who is in his 50s , never takes coffee to go . 
  before he goes anywhere he has to prepare his coffee , drink it for 5 minutes and only then can he leave . 
  kahvitauko , he calls it . 
  this kind of coffee culture is very common among more traditional or older finns . 
  the author of the article likely does n't hang out with young adults in their 20s or late teens . 
  it probably was n't that exiting , finns likely did n't have too many clashes with the vikings . 
  but we do know that : a new kind of burial metod called * polttokentt\u00e4kalmisto * had started to spread in finland in which the dead were cremated . 
  it was slowly starting to replace the traditional burial method , * ry\u00f6kki\u00f6hauta * , of crafting a grave made out of rocks and earth . 
  christian symbols in jewellry and other objects are also starting to appear around this time in the pagan finland . 
  these were not made in finland , so it is unclear what meaning they had to the finns , if any . 
  they might not even have known that they were carrying christian symbols . 
  scandinavian ring-hilt swords dating back to this time period have as well been found in western finland . 
  swords of this type were likely given as gifts among the elite rather than sold as merchandise , which suggests that the local elite forged alliances and fought alongside scandinavian kings . 
  most likely with the swedes , but possibly also with the danes . 
  cats !, 
  their bones start appearing in graves around this time . 
  cats becoming more common probably had to do with rats also coming more common . 
  cats were used keep rats and other rodents out of the grain reserve . 
  horses start showing up in the archaeological record around 550-800 , but they likely exited in finland hundreds of years prior to that . 
  the horse was mainly used for riding , but it was likely harnessed to pull a sleigh , also . 
  there is no evidence of wheeled vechiles during this time period , and they probably would n't have been suited for finnish roads anyway . 
  intrestingly , the `` do n't say things you do n't mean '' thing does n't apply in sweden , at least according to mark levengood who is a finland-swedish sweden-finn . 
  i wonder how or if the rest of the article applies to sweden . 
  compound nouns are common in english too . 
  the only difference is that they 're often spelled separately ( ham sandwich vs. hamsandwich ) . 
  finnish grammar is not by any means impossible . 
  indeed , what is impossible about using a suffix instead of a preposition ? 
  in english you 'd say ' ** on ** a table ' , while in finnish it 's ` p\u00f6yd\u00e4 ** ll\u00e4 ** ' . 
  how are suffixes so much more impossible than pepositions ? 
  now , what is actually impossibly crazy is grammatical gender , which finnish does n't have . 
  italian does , though . 
  so since finns were n't literal slaves that made them equal ? 
  i doubt it . 
  and what comes to the representatives , would n't they have realistically almost always been a swede who lived in finland ? 
  i doubt you could have been a representative unless you spoke swedish and were relatively powerful . 
  finnish-speaking peasants did n't speak swedish , so it 's highly unlikely that they would have had the same rights as swedish-speaking peasants . 
  by the way , you are looking at irrelevant latin etymologies . 
  the word for finn in swedish evolved from old norse [ finnr ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/finnr#old_norse ) , and it 's not like they could have forgotten the word for 600 years and suddenly started to use it once finland separated from sweden . 
  finn was likely used as a demonym for finnish-speakers throughout the country 's history , because why would they have used the same word for a finno-ugric people that they were n't linguistically or ethnically related to that they used for themselves ? 
  that 's not an apt comparison since everyone here already knows what circumcision entails . 
   expand your vocabulary please , this is cringe inducing . 
  do you have zero self-awareness ? 
  why are you getting so triggered by everyone who disagrees with you on this thread ? 
  frankly , trying to insult someone 's intelligence by picking apart their grammar just comes off as really insecure and petty . 
  why does the written language matter ? 
   secondly , the people living in what later would become finland had exactly the same rights as the rest of the population in the swedish kingdom . 
  source ? 
   heck , they were n't even called finns source ? 
  the word * ` finn ' * predates the whole kingdom of sweden . 
   the swedish language may be much older , going back to old norse but there were never any institutions before in finland nor a written language . 
  agricola created the language from scratch . 
  holy mother of / r/badlinguistics . 
  swedish is not `` an older language '' , nor has it been longer in finland . 
  that 's just demonstrably false . 
  and agricola did n't create anything from cratch ; do you know what expression `` from scratch '' means ? 
  written finnish was based on existing finnish dialects that were there as a result of thousands of years of linguistic evolution . 
  how would it have any negative effect whatsoever ? 
  students would still have to choose a language they want to study , they 'd just be more motivated because they could choose the language they themselves are interested in . 
  there 's literally no downside to letting students choose what language they want to study . 
  making everyone study one language against their will is asinine and detrimental to their progress in language learning . 
  if someone feels swedish is a big part of their culture or identity they can still study swedish if it 's made voluntary . 
  you ca n't dictate what is or is n't part of someone 's identity . 
  people who feel culturally connected to swedish could still study it , and people who do n't could choose another language that they 're interested in . 
  according to a study by folktinget titled `` v\u00e5rt land , v\u00e5rt spr\u00e5k '' , 75 % percent of finnish-speaking finns consider swedish just one language among many others . 
  you can not dictate other people 's identity . 
  time spent studying swedish could be spent studying a language you actually want to learn . 
  pretty sure that 's south korea, 
  -15 \u00b0 c is n't really cold for winter .
