  i guess tolkien borrowed her name . 
  geographically norway , sweden and a part of northern finland are in the skandinavian peninsula , but culturally scandinavian countries are norway , sweden and denmark . 
  and this is the reason for it : [ skandinavism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavism ) and swedish was the only official language of finland , but 80 % of the people did n't speak or understand it even then . 
  only in perkunas ( perkele ) . 
  it 's also possible that the finnish god ukko is the same god as perkele , as ukko means `` old man '' or `` guy '' . 
  maybe ukko was used when the people were too afraid to say the real name perkele aloud . 
  or maybe perkunas just replaced ukko . 
  perkele was a god , but the church did n't like these pagan gods and turned the word to mean the devil . 
  and then it become a curse word . 
  originally perkele was a baltic god of thunder called perk\u016bnas . 
  it 's over -30 \u00b0 on wednesday and thursday , but only -25 \u00b0 on friday !, 
  the german said so and i just answered to that . 
  i do n't know , plenty of finnish users , plenty of opinions . 
  and people are pissed of , recession has lasted already seven years and this will not help , probably only makes things worse . 
  more than 12 , or so . 
  the article is from october 2 , 2015 . 
  1050 , do you really think finland got only 1050 asylum seekers ... 
  even the eu quota for finland is bigger ( 3000 ) . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-finland-iduskcn0rw10n20151002 at first they estimated 50 000 people , but by the end of the year they found out it 's only 35 000 . 
  here are now 35 000 people who walked here , and then some people from the eu quota . 
  35 000 last year . 
  edit . 
  after checking the exact amount is : 32 478 . 
  i do n't think `` vaino '' and vanya ( vanja ) have anything to do with each other . 
  it 's just a russian nickname for people who are called ivan , just like vladimirs are called vova by them etc. 
  when i was a kid i thought minnesota was a really scary sounding place ( minne = where , sota = war ) . 
  vajna and vojna etc. 
  look a lot like vainaja ( deceased ) , but apparently vainaja is a germanic loanword . 
  finnish santa is from finland , danish santa is from greenland , most santas are from the north pole etc. 
  those finns who want to heave greece out also want to heave finland out . 
  just midsummer magic : if you collect seven flowers/herbs on the midsummer night , and go over seven fences , and sleep the flowers/herbs under your pillow , you will see your future husband/wife in your dream . 
  there are other magic tricks too , and most of them demand that you are naked when you do them . 
  they show [ `` the snowman '' ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/lumiukko_%28elokuva%29 ) animation here every christmas . 
  and [ `` from all of us to all of you '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/from_all_of_us_to_all_of_you ) . 
  stockmann is going to sell their russian stores completely . 
  it was in the news some days ago . 
  i guess they have been in under the impression that someone will get them a job , house , residence permit etc. 
  when they arrive here . 
  i have no idea what the smugglers have told to them . 
  even one refugee said that some of the `` refugees '' have come here only to party and play with snow . 
  there are some people who thought they would get a job , but now they are just killing time in reception centers without nothing to do . 
  in 1890 45,6 % spoke finnish , and 45,6 % spoke swedish , at least if you believe this [ site ] ( http://www2.kirjastot.fi/kysy/arkistohaku/kysymys/?id=27a1a9cd-2b65-438c-9059-82a1db1106d7 ) . 
  it 's also estimated that in 1891 there were already more finnish speakers . 
  hm , not us . 
  hungarian far-right denies that hungarian is related to finnish . 
  finno-ugric languages are a conspiracy of imperialists of vienna and moscow , and its purpose is to humiliate hungarians . 
  they are rather related to egyptians , mesopotamians , philippines etc. 
  there was a big article about it some years ago . 
  it 's now about [ 1,3 ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1448067878679.html ), 
  northern norway ( and sweden , finland and russia ) [ sami ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_people ) , and the right of finland [ karelians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_karelia ) . 
  but i 'm not sure does neither group have separatist movements ... 
  there 's been food aid lines since the 90s . 
  some people really need them ( small pensions etc. 
  ) , and then there are people like one relative of mine who takes his food from there only because it 's free ... 
  reindeer and elk are the same ? 
  in finnish poro is a reindeer . 
  `` the new rules would n't affect quota refugees or asylum seekers granted refugee status , but would affect the asylum seekers who get residence permits based on secondary protection . '', 
  i thought they do n't have compulsory finnish classes in \u00c5land anymore ? 
  kuusi = six and spruce . 
  kuu = moon , but if you add `` si '' to the end it can also mean `` your moon '' ( e.g auto = car , autosi = your car , talo = house , talosi = your house ) . 
  palaa = burns , returns . 
  to those who have seen that kuusi palaa thing ... 
  no , russian is a slavic and indo-european language . 
  at least wikipedia says their number is 5,3 % . 
  but swedish is a mandatory language in schools for finnish speaking finns , so at least some people learn it quite well . 
  if i remember right . 
  i ca n't remember did he got it back . 
  edit : i found out it did sank to the sea , and v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen tried to search for it but in vain . 
  he made a new one from birch . 
  v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen wo n't borrow his kantele to anyone , it sank to the sea . 
  the only thing i can think of is [ kantele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kantele ) . 
  similar instruments can be found from the vicinity of the baltic sea , and the instument family is known as baltic psalteries . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsearuiytss ) . 
  i think the practice during peace time is this : warn them that they are approaching the finnish air space , if they do n't listen we send our hornet fighter jets to identify the intruder . 
  if the intruder still does n't take the hint , then they are given a warning that they will be shoot down next . 
  but i guess it 's different with turkey as it announced a long time ago they will shoot every intruder down . 
  `` we 'll close centres that are judged to be in the wrong places from the standpoint of security -- for instance , too far away in terms of police operations , says the interior minister . '', 
  i think this was agreed in the emergency meeting . 
  i once read his interview from the 90s where he was really angry with us because we were giving copiers to the baltic states and not to russia . 
  he said they can never give us anything in return , except cheese . 
  and of course he also wanted the russian empire back . 
  i have no idea did we really give copiers to them . 
  and why cheese . 
  and there is also this : `` during the 1960s karjala beer was already a fading brand until the soviet union 's ambassador to finland , andrei e. kovalev , stated in 1968 publicly that the label of karjala beer evoked wrong perceptions from the war times . 
  karjala beer 's label has the coat of arms of karelia which features an arm wielding straight western ( swedish ) sword thrusting a russian sabre wielded by another arm . 
  the press noted the event with an article spanning 14 broadsheet pages and karjala-beer gained new steam as a brand . '', 
  at least [ mtv news ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/sipila-kutsui-koolle-kriisikokouksen-kempeleen-raiskaustapauksen-johdosta/5575508 ) says now , that sipil\u00e4 did n't call the crisis meeting because of this special case . 
  they had agreed to have this meeting already earlier . 
  sweden and united states have also violated our borders , we did n't shoot them down either ... 
  hm , i do n't know , but somalis were our first big immigrant group , and they arrived during the early 90s from the soviet union . 
  finland was also in recession at the time . 
  so we are n't that used to immigrants yet ... 
  but the passengers were just innocent tourist , they had n't shot down anyone . 
  `` i was unable to find data for some countries . 
  if you know a source for a country that is not yet included in the map , i would be grateful if you let me know . '', 
  they probably just could n't find data about portugal . 
  ... we have beaches , but lakeside street would probably be a better translation . 
  is it paavo v\u00e4yrynen again ? 
  belongs to the same series with `` finnish schools do n't assign homework . '', 
  edit : i did n't know norway and russia give their oil to us ...
