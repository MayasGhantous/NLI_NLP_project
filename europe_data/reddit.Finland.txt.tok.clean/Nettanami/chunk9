  so he did n't even believe finland and sweden would have been able to defend them , it would have only brought false feeling of security . 
  they always sound and act like that when they do n't like something and want someone to give up on their plans ... but are you serious ? 
  fearing for your life ... ? 
  so it 's translated correctly . 
  i thought there could be a mistake . 
  `` according to the reporter of the rbk-channel , after the speech enthusiastic audience shouted `` very seriously '' the slogan `` ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 , crimea is ours , give us poland and finland . '', 
  or something ... 
  this was suggested in finland already a year ago . 
  big companies use english anyway , so what difference it would make ? 
  `` nowadays none of the finnish politicians can say anything about defence , sanctions , ukraine , finnish and russian relations , or nato without it being reported in the russian media . 
  and it often happens that the statements are n't published as they were said , but the way they serve the interest of russia the best . '', 
  ( from `` ven\u00e4j\u00e4n verkossa '' , a page that publishes official things said about finland . ), 
  for some reason russia does n't like military cooperation between finland and sweden either . 
  it was judged as a `` military alliance against russia '' and `` northern nato '' . 
  eastern `` finland '' was russian a bit longer time than western `` finland '' , and the border changed from time to time until sweden got the most of `` finland '' ( and , well , even after that ) . 
  and during the great northern war finland was occupied completely and was under the russian rule for some horrible years ( also known as `` the greater wrath '' , was returned to sweden , but lost the karelian isthmus ) . 
  and during the hats ' war finland was occupied again and was under the russian rule for some time ( also known as `` the lesser wrath '' , was eventually returned to sweden , but lost even bigger piece of land ) . 
  and in 1809 sweden lost finland completely . 
  i guess you meant this by `` bounced '' . 
  finland was n't housing 250 000 wehrmacht troops when they took it . 
  but anyway , this is just a military exercise . 
  finland is going to have one too in the north during the summer with multiple countries ... 
  ... he 's dead ... 
  i do n't really know ... 
  i guess i just hope they can overcome the crisis . 
  finnish word for mother '' \u00e4iti '' , is a loanword from gothic `` ai\u00feei '' . 
  the original finnish word was probably `` emo '' or `` em\u00e4 '' ( mother in estonian is still `` ema '' ) , but nowadays `` emo '' means only animal mothers in finnish . 
  but none of those resembles mama ... 
  `` there is a lighthouse on the finnish side of the current border , which has been unmanned and automated since 1979 . 
  when it was built by the russians and finns in 1885 , the island was considered a no man 's land , so it was simply built on the highest point on the island . 
  however , this meant it was built on the swedish part of the island . 
  as a result , the border was adjusted in 1985 so that the lighthouse is now located on finnish territory . 
  the adjustment was carried out such that no net transfer of territory occurred , and the ownership of the coastline was unchanged so as not to interfere with each country 's fishing rights . '', 
  in western finland `` en kehtaa '' means `` i 'm too ashamed of '' , they will never understand you meant i ca n't be bothered . 
  there it 's `` en viitsi '' , just like in estonia . 
  well ... that 's not very cute anymore . 
  maybe it would look a little bit better if the picture was n't black and white . 
  the place looks small and cute to me . 
  dandelions are called butter flowers in finnish too . 
  and it used to be `` miukumauku '' too ( miaow-meow ) . 
  the svir river in russia is called syv\u00e4ri in finnish . 
  i wonder have they something to do with each other . 
  i think these were voted as the ugliest surnames : n\u00e4nnim\u00e4inen - like a nipple suoyrj\u00f6 - swamp vomit . 
  it might be a plant , but it sounds like a vomit . 
  `` ai t\u00e4h '' is more like `` huh , wha ? '' . 
  the real `` what '' is `` mit\u00e4 '' . 
  but i wonder why our `` thanks '' is `` kiitos '' and estonian is `` ait\u00e4h '' or `` t\u00e4nan '' . 
  so different . 
  you can say `` auta minua '' if you want . 
  but most finns would probably shorten it to `` auta mua '' or just `` auta '' . 
  this happened in 2013 . 
  the same as the swedish keyboard . 
  b\u00e4ckman started to support the new party already on 25 january . 
  the weird thing is that apparently v\u00e4yrynen announced the new party ten days later . 
  so how did he know about it in advance ? 
  i thought the brick-soap is butter . 
  me too =( . 
  and i even used to draw a lot . 
  we know , the claim caused some annoyance here . 
  but it was german klaus kinkel who started to solve various disagreements between the finns and pangalos . 
  apperently it took about 40 hours . 
  here are some , but they are in finnish . 
  greece had the presidency , that 's true . 
  greece had an important but also a really harsh role . 
  at the last moment especially german pressure made the greek negotiators to accept the finnish membership . 
  theodore pangalos thought the finns will ruin the union with their horrible economy , told them to shut up , and the finns also `` negotiated like the russians '' according to him , and therefore were n't very good candidates . 
  the finnish negotiators almost left from the room after that . 
  hm , we have agreed to take our quota from greece and italy , actually we are among the few who have already taken some refugees from them . 
  but it 's not the solution for this because they get more and more people every day . 
  and we were the scapegoat in the 90s . 
  france and greece would have loved to deny our membership because our economy was a disaster . 
  germany helped us to make a really devastating austerity program and i guess it helped , but we are still paying the price ( and we are in recession again now . ), 
  hm , our awful nuclear bomb song is from 1982 , and luckily nuclear war did n't start in 1983 even if it apparently was close . 
  we had a song about nuclear war where europe turned into a nuclear poo ... it got 0 points . 
  but it was in finnish so nobody probably understood it . 
  nope : `` finns differed clearly from central europeans . 
  within finland , the genetic difference between eastern and western finns was striking , higher than between the germans and british . 
  the population in southern sweden was relatively homogeneous and genetically close to the germans and british , while the northern subpopulations differed from the south and also from each other . 
  swedes and finns who live near each other in the north , are n't very close genetically , but surprisingly , the north swedes have a quite close genetic link with the south-western finns . '', 
  it was the same here . 
  not necessary , if i remember correct , the finnish word for teeth ( hampaat ) is a loan word . 
  that does n't mean the finno-ugric people did n't have teeth . 
  the original word has been forgotten a long time ago . 
  or maybe a forest was just `` a lot of trees '' or something . 
  the sami word `` vuovdi '' looks very much like the finnish word `` vuori '' ( mountain ) . 
  and the proto-indo-european `` aut ( i ) o '' looks very much like the finnish word `` autio '' , which means deserted even today . 
  not at all , really . 
  every month except the summer months were warmer than usually . 
  only the summer months were colder than usually . 
  a `` month '' in finnish is actually `` kuukausi '' ( kuu + kausi , moon + phase ) , but in the month names only `` kuu '' is used . 
  kuu means `` moon '' or `` month '' in this case . 
  and we love all of our vowels . 
  * tammikuu - nowadays it sounds like `` oak month '' but originally it meant something like the `` heart of the winter month '' . 
  * helmikuu - pearl month * maaliskuu - earthly month * huhtikuu - slash-and-burn month ( an agricultural technique ) * toukokuu - sowing/ploughing/harrowing month * kes\u00e4kuu - summer month . 
  originally it meant `` kesanto month '' ( some of the arable land is left uncultivated years or more ) . 
  original name used to be winter month . 
  most of them are loan words from swedish , not sure about `` keskiviikko '' ( wednesday ) which means `` middle week '' . 
  pula means shortage in finnish . 
  puola means [ a bobbin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bobbin ) or a spoke in finnish if you write it with a small letter . 
  in kalevala , the spirit of air ilmatar created the world ( well , in reality a duck did it , but she helped ) .
