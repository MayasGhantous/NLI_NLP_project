  it 's also worth mentioning that if usa had lost the cold war , you could have written that `` it 's incredible that americans thought that finland was a liberal democracy just because you could buy coke '' . 
  the whole policy was designed to make both blocks feel like they were more symphatised by the elite . 
  tl ; dr : saying that any country with representative democracy is `` liberal '' is wrong . 
  the tectonic border goes trough the middle of the island . 
  so it 's both europe and americas . 
   put to rest their support of north korea i understand that kim jong un is losing chinese support due to his shenanigans , so this might be closer than you think . 
  south korea might well promise neutrality , retreating from nato ( or something else like that , i do n't really understand korean politics ) over getting a mid - to long-term integration plan under way ( straight-out unification would be a disaster for south korea ) . 
   let go of taiwan china and taiwan signed a trade-pact last year ( it 's not really popular with taiwanese citizenry , though ) . 
  as long as both governments keep on insisting that there is only one china ( with them as the top ) this is as good as it gets . 
   bury the hatchet with japan over ww2 and their disputed territories . 
  turkey and greece have huge armies because both are sure that the other one will invade one day . 
  being allied with west and being buddies with all players of the `` western block '' are not the same thing , 
  too soon . 
  at least for me : /, 
   my parents and grandparents were all paid to go to university . 
  so , they were paid on top of student benefits ? 
  you should maybe kick him out . 
  then this would n't reflect badly on you , you know :p, 
   but i ca n't imagine displaying the hammer and sickle . . 
  most countries have communist ( or socialist ) parties that still use this symbol . 
  so using this would generally mean the same as having the republican elephant-logo on the stage in usa ... ok , does n't sound so impressive , but you get the point . 
   . . or a swastika because i decided it felt `` rock and roll . '', 
  [ this group is special only in the sense that somebody called them out . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/kishidan-nazi-uniforms-japan-aplogy ), 
   film censorship boards ... ( i think it disappeared after the 70s ) in the liberal finland we withstood till 2001 !, 
   liberal attitude towards alcohol ( compared to the us ) i fully endorse the swedish system , but calling systembolaget `` liberal '' is just plain lying . 
   this just makes me so mad . 
  i 'm not exactly happy myself . 
  even more so because the government rushed through a steep cut in the company taxation last year ( 24 %  20 % ) with the idea that when the companies are taxed less , they pay more . 
  surprisingly the income fell down . . about two thirds of the sum `` saved '' here from students . 
  as additional fun fact , the right-wingers online have been calling for students to live on loans after they have exhausted their allowance-months , apparently missing the fact that you can only get student loans on top of the allowance . 
  and after allowance is gone , so is the chance for student loans . 
  the end-result is that students will get more depressed and less likely to get medical help with those problems . 
  i have a horrible hunch that we will be paying for these cuts many times over in the following years . 
   that last `` light news '' was unnecessary . 
  which is why i marked it as light news . 
  i had been thinking on the subject for some time and when this came out i cobbled it up with great enthusiasm . 
  i found it very interesting how the piece showed both racism ( perhaps we need this law for muslims and immigrants ) , cultural exceptionism ( naturally this would n't apply for jews ) and then completely absurd escalation ( this thing is important enough that we will all leave the country ) and name-calling ( anti-semitism ) . 
  i thought that this would be something / r/europe might enjoy . 
  but perhaps this was n't the right place . 
   makes you look like a `` persu '' ( basic finn - party member ) . 
  the official translation of the party name is `` the finns '' ( which portrays the other parties as not-finnish ) or if you want a 1:1 translation , `` the true finns '' ( as in , they are the silent majority ) . 
  i do n't really care what people think of me based on one sole message . 
  i wrote the above mainly for the cabinet-news ( as i considered that to be something that somebody should write , and i did n't see anybody else jumping forward ) , but then thought that perhaps i should collect some more interesting tidbits as well . 
   we have much , much more serious problems ahead than that . 
  yeah , like shuffling of the deck of ministers . 
  to which i devoted most of my time . 
   like the russian nuclear power plant . 
  should we take it ? 
  should have added that . 
  alas , i did n't come across it when i skimmed through the weekly news . 
  did n't really help that i skipped this news item in finnish as the whole discussion is pretty much for or against , never mind the facts , so have n't really followed the latest development . 
   oh , and that `` muslim women police '' - thing was also almost a april joke , `` wtf-who cares '' kinda story . 
  i found the criteria for the police entrance exams to be shocking . 
  it shows that `` neutral policeperson '' means the same as `` native finn '' , which is n't really something you would expect from an organisation that 's supposed to be neutral and uphold the peace in multicultural communities . 
  also , published 3rd of april . 
   young people do n't give a fuck about that kinda shit , nor the `` spring-hymn '' news . 
  what 's this about `` young people '' ? 
  and i think that while `` spring hymn '' by itself is n't very important , it 's a flashpoint which we will someday use to judge what is religion and what 's tradition . 
  as finland 's non-lutheran population grows , this will stay on the agenda till it will one year be removed . 
  in some areas of helsinki non-lutherans are already the majority . 
  i also think it interests foreigners . 
   makes me wonder that how old a you and what 's your agenda ? 
  old enough that i ca n't use age as an excuse and young enough that i ca n't use age as an excuse , if that makes sense . 
  and my agenda was to write down the piece about cabinet which i beefed up with stuff that interests me as a person . 
  you will note that what i wrote above is very much in line with my comment history . 
  it might not be what everybody else considers as worth writing , but then , i wrote the post , you did n't . 
  by custom you were supposed to add the missing news items as it 's own post underneath mine and if necessary critique me on false or lacking information ( such as forgetting to mention the green party ) . 
  instead you attack me as an person ( i expect the `` makes you look like a true finn '' and `` how old are you '' were meant as an insults ) . 
   to make finland look like an ass ? 
  i 'm not the tourist board . 
  second , you claim that the posts i put worth are insignificant and uninteresting , then you go on to say that i 'm damaging finnish national image ? 
  if nothing else , writing about `` uninteresting '' stuff shows that things are well ( no news are good news , as they say ) . 
  third , the austerity policies are baffling ( and the biggest story of 2014 , thus far ) . 
  everything else compared to it will look insignificant and uninteresting . 
  thanks . 
  **** finland **** huge week . 
  as you may or may not know , our state cabinet consists of the right wing kokoomus-party assisted by social democrats and few hangers-on ( christian democrats , swedish people 's party , ( and until recently ) left alliance ) . 
  edit : and the green party !, 
  the past few years our public spending has been percentage-point or two on the minus-side which kokoomus has been trying to use as an excuse to dismantle the welfare state . 
  they finally succeeded in convincing that if nothing is done right now we will lose our aaa-category and then our loans will suddenly all jump to 10 % and finland will join greece . 
  left alliance left the government the other week due to disagreeing to cut child benefits . 
  so , keynes is out and austerity is in . 
  this week we find out that no new ministers are hired to replace the leaving two left alliance ministers and [ instead the minister responsible for housing will take over culture and sports ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/housing_minister_pia_viitanen_takes_on_sport_and_culture_portfolio/7171778 ) while [ the minister of local government will now also handle transport . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/henna_virkkunen_to_take_on_transport_portfolio/7167914 ) apparently this was done `` in the spirit of austerity '' . 
  it 's widely believed that the left alliance-led change for shifting money from roads to rails will be undone . 
  we also heard what is going to be cut : [ student allowances , student allowance for second degree is removed , student healthcare got more expensive , student housing support is removed ( in select cities ) ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/government_to_slash_support_for_study_towards_same-level_degrees/7175277 ) and [ child benefits are decreased . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finance_minister_child_benefit_cuts_to_stay/7175649 ) apparently tuition fees for everybody were on the table as well , but we dodged that bullet . . this time . 
  you may note that the benefits seem to be targeted to students and you may guess that the total savings coming from these are fairly small . 
  more cuts are apparently coming after the elections next year . 
  few days after that [ the prime minister katainen announced that he will not be seeking to keep the chair at kokoomus on the party elections next summer , and will instead seek something new . 
  it 's widely assumed he will try to be nominated for the president of the council of eu or failing that , as one of the commissars ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/expert_katainens_timed_ec_bid_right/7176398 ) . 
  so come june , we will have a new prime minister . 
  the usual suspects are also trying to get to the european parliament , so the position of prime minister of finland will essentially be regarded as a consolation prize . 
  around the same time social democrats are also having elections for their new chair . 
  the current chair is running but she 's widely seen as unlikely to win , meaning that our state cabinet will enter its last year staffed with understudies . 
  on other news , we had our [ yearly discussion if singing hyms at the school spring festival is religious activity or cultural one ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/summer_hymn_can_continue_to_be_sung_in_schools/7174276 ) . 
  we also had a short discussion on police uniforms . 
  [ police ca n't wear religious symbols and based on this fact they had n't allowed muslim women to police academy ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/could_finnish_policewomen_wear_headscarves/7171472 ) . 
  apparently we should follow sweden 's example .
