  but i do like that you took that instead of the us one . 
  seems more down to earth . 
  hiding your nationality . 
  or what exactly do you mean ? 
  as opposed to hiding under some eu-flag or having canadian flag , you mean ? 
  for foreigners : note how limited that network is : it only serves tampere and capital region . 
  less than fifth of finnish population is even theoretically reachable by the network . 
  the gas is n't also directly used to heat houses but burned in omnivorish central power stations ( they also run on wood , and we have a lot of wood ) . 
  even if the power stations were to be put offline , we can still ship electricity from sweden , norway and estonia to offset the 10 % we now get from gas . 
  not to mention a lot of our energy usage is frankly just convenience and can be turned off . 
  you forget prepaids . 
  we were said that `` irlanti '' is the island , but `` eire '' is the nation . 
  similarly as we were said that we were supposed to say `` yhdysvallat '' and not `` amerikka '' . 
  now that i think about it , several of my teachers made distinctions between geographical and institutional names . 
  i think the idea is to be exact so people who are included in the geographical formation but not the political areal do n't take offence ( canadians , mexicans , north irish , norwegians etc. 
   `` is the tap water drinkable ? '', 
  this is a good question . 
  healthy and `` tastes ok '' are not the same thing . 
  different purification plants use different techniques and some techniques leave part aftertaste . 
  ( even us , the country that 's every way better than sweden ^ ^ in ^ ^ ideal ^ ^ world have bad tasting water in certain locations . ), 
  well done . 
  those do n't seem very well targetted . 
  even i got pissed . 
  it 's not just irish who complain about that . 
  / r/finland is more or less frequently visited by americans who call themselves finnish while being unsure how their surname is spelled ( or what it means or if it 's actually even a real word ) . 
   because it 's only ever done by one country , and was done for political reasons . 
  is that country finland ? 
  because back in school we were several times sharpened that writing `` irlanti '' instead of `` eire '' was a good way to drop a grade . 
   i wonder how these compare to non-european countries . 
  co2 affects us globally and the rest of the world is a much bigger deal . 
  i wondered the same , [ so i went to google public data ] ( https://www.google.fi/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:usa:rus:deu:chn:fin:ind:bra&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  here are co2-emissions by per capita for few individual countries as well as for the whole world . 
  no eu , though !, 
  : / edit : [ here 's the numbers by country without taking into account population ] ( https://www.google.fi/publicdata/explore?ds=cjsdgb406s3np_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=emissions#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=emissions&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:60:65:143:185:24:36:77&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  looks far less shiny . 
  our ever-growing population made the numbers look way too pretty : /, 
  i 'd congratulate us too , if i did n't have this suspicion that this is n't due to energy efficiency but eurocrisis . 
  less need for our products ( most of which include high energy usage ) , less need for coal plants . 
  back then it was the outlier . 
  now its the rule . 
   while we 're on the subject , how viable would a track from stockholm to turku be , going through \u00c2land and the whole archipelago there ? 
  there 's a road to \u00c5land already , though about 25 kilometres of it is covered by government-funded barges . 
  about 5 kilometres of that is probably cheaper to just build bridges instead ( they 're just short island hops ) , but there 's some sort of strange budget reason why they operate barges instead . 
  the rest 20 kilometres . . 
  i do n't know . 
  i think most of the water between the smaller islands is pretty swallow , so bridges should be possible at least some of the time . 
  the 10 kilometres between \u00c5land and turku archipelago looks pretty deep , though . 
  it 's another 30 kilometres from \u00c5land to sweden and there are no isles in-between ( the main reason why \u00c5land belongs to finland ) . 
  to that part , you would have to build a tunnel . 
  ( i 'm not an engineer of any sort . 
  i 'm not even that well familiar with similar projects in the big world . ), 
  that second panel was really something . 
  i actually said exactly the same as the finlandball . 
  well done artist , well done . 
   that 's not how english language work . 
  i can not add `` all '' whereever you would like . 
  absence of closer specification means `` some '' not `` all '' . 
  the keywords were `` general '' and `` radical '' . 
  that is :   ** general ** : relating to the main or major parts of something rather than the details : not specific ( meriam-webster )   ** radical ** : having extreme political or social views that are not shared by most people ( meriam-webster ) . 
   do you understand that freiberg school [ 1 ] is not an actual school with students and teachers but so called `` school of thought '' , in other words philosophy or ideology ? 
  philosophy or ideology ca n't do anything . 
  today freiberg school is a viewpoint . 
  but it was put in existence by group of people who authored papers from certain viewpoint which was then shared by their pupils . 
  and as a group , it can be referred to as an operator . 
   that 's pretty good summation in the single sentence , if you ask me . 
  no it is n't . 
  `` general condemnation of economic liberalization policies '' means ** all ** economic liberalization policies . 
  the summary says `` negative term ** associated ** with ** radical ** economic reforms '' . 
  that 's the difference between saying that cults are dangerous and religion is dangerous . 
   you may ask how did the meaning change , but i think it 's quite obvious . 
  it has been excessively used . . you are generalizing your personal experience in your own country into applying the whole world . 
   leftists as a replacement word for capitalism to reuse old communist aguments since bashing capitalism is n't cool any more . 
  you are confusing `` leftists '' with `` communists '' . 
   yet it started with very specific meaning not empty as you wrote in your other comment . 
  you proved it yourself with that research article quote . 
  the meaning of the word dates to `` back to ( classic ) liberalism in modern times '' . 
  that 's the literal meaning of the world and you can pretty easily come up with it if you are aware of the original classic liberalism of 1860s . 
  german freiberg school did some thinking on what neoliberalism was in the 1930s , but that it was -- thinking -- before politicians started to use it in political fashion in the 1970s . 
  when today we speak of neoliberalism , we either mean the problems caused by the original liberalism in 1860s or that caused by neoliberalism in 1970s , not what freiberg school thought in between . 
  the connotation changed when instead of spin of `` neoliberalism fixing the problems of classic liberalism '' and few theories from 1930s we got actual real cases and they were n't positive . 
  it 's the same thing we got with fascism ( which was the golden boy in the 1920s , 1930s and now succesful countries that could be defined as fascist do n't want to identify so -- instead fascist just means `` bad '' ) . 
  that link does n't speak anything about `` roma mobsters showing up in black benzes to shoo him away '' . 
  instead it says that the roma looked at the `` domestic alternative '' and went somewhere else peacefully . 
  upvoted above for delivering . 
  i posted a new comment on the above quote you made to keep the topic somewhat manageable . 
  true , meaning of words shift as the world turns . 
  but there is change and there 's change . 
  there 's wrong usage springing from usage without understanding ( `` literally '' springs readily to mind ) and then there 's meaning drift as empty category has been slowly filled . 
  i admit that `` neoliberalism '' has changed over the years . 
  but this is largely because the term started as empty category with large hopes . 
  after it had gotten content ( examples of policies marked by their makers as neoliberal ) it is understandable that we can start to use it in a negative light . 
  worth noticing that ( at least in finland ) `` neoliberal '' is still in use by political parties on both sides of the isle to describe planned and executed policies . 
  left reacts to it negatively but apparently the right does n't , as its usage is continued . 
  i 'd also claim that the wikipedia quote is against the reference it sources but that 's a separate discussion , 
  i just got off the mobile and checked the wikipedia reference for the above quote . 
  the reference is [ this research article ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs12116-009-9040-5 ) which abstract says . .   we show that neoliberalism has undergone a striking transformation , from a positive label coined by the german freiberg school to denote a moderate renovation of classical liberalism , to a normatively negative term associated with radical economic reforms in pinochet 's chile . 
  this is quite different from what wikipedia says . .   `` today the term is mostly used as a general condemnation of economic liberalization policies and their advocates . '', 
  i would love to see that piece of news . 
  the term is sometimes used wrongly . 
  does n't mean there is n't a definition nor that it is n't an academic term .
