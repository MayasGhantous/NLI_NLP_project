  you 're forgetting how much centre 's voters rely on the eu agricultural policy , including production quotas . 
  to speak nothing infrastructure ( for example , matkahuolto/vr , posti ) . 
  liberal trade leads to empty countryside without services . 
   there are no real liberal parties in finland swedish people 's party comes close . 
  as does pirate party . 
  the finns ' precursor party was in the government twice in the 80s ( they renamed themselves due to taxation reasons ) . 
   it looks like there are 9 parties in the parliament , right ? 
  there 's 8 . 
  the additional one is the representative from \u00c5land isles ( due to autonomy , they have separate party structure ) . 
  but whoever wins that seat always goes into alliance with the party of swedish-speaking folk . 
  that 's a nice graph , but it was made after the questions were already answered and given conservative/liberal-leaning only after-the-fact . 
  as such , it has certain problems with balance ( as admitted by the maker of the graph himself , from whom hs bought it after it had gained visibility in social media ) . 
  but all in all , i do n't disagree with the results . 
  just a point that the coder is n't exactly a social politician and may have intreped some of the results a bid badly . 
  further [ i do n't really agree with the four-field names ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/suomi/comments/333xsr/rsuomi_puoluekannatus/cqht1i6 ) ( in finnish , sorry ) . 
  ( but i 'm honestly happy you entered this into the conversation  edit : in general , it might be hard to do a conservative/liberal split in these `` choose either or '' questions . 
  the questions themselves have a political bias and do n't take into account that somebody might answer `` yes '' for more than one reason . 
   what ? 
  did you read the rest of the sentence ? 
  i thought it was pretty self-explanatory . 
  if you live in kepuland , you do n't join sdp or coalition even if you have such inclinations : you join centre and try to advance your ideas within those parameters . 
   national coalition party is liberal , not conservative . 
  coalition is a conservative party with a liberal wing . 
  this is why the classic avatar of the party is the * kyp\u00e4r\u00e4pappi * ( military + religious authority ) . 
  katainen and stubb tried to get rid of this view but in the end failed : this is why over half of the coalition representatives voted against the gay-rights and why [ stubb had to back-pedal on being liberal ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2014122718954574_uu.shtml ) . 
   the finns is conservative . 
  the finns is an off-shoot of the centre party . 
  their raison d'etre is to be a more populist centre-party for lower-educated centre-party voters . 
  as such , much of what i said about [ nordic agrarian parties ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/334ftc/finns_vote_expected_to_oust_government/cqhtjj9 ) also includes the finns . 
  edit : and as they 're an agrarian party , they also get a lot of socialist/social democrat-voters . 
  this is the main reason ( according my politics teacher ) why traditional left is doing so badly . 
  agrarian parties are a bit like communist party in china : whatever your political views , if you live in the area ruled by an agrarian party , you join the agrarian party . 
  this means that the party includes some very leftist and some very rightist views , depending on the representative . 
  due to this , the chairperson 's personality affects a lot what the party actually is : they can weight the left or they can weight the right . 
  but whatever else , they have to keep the countryside alive compared to the metropolitan areas . 
  this means weighting small business . 
  which in turn means tring to help small companies by making enterprising easier ( due to lack of other work ) and pushing state services ( because the self-employed voters are too poor to use private health care or plan for pensions ) . 
  this garners them a lot of votes even in cities , but then we get to the part two : trying to get more industry/infrastructure to the countryside . 
  usually this includes ( but is not limited to ) building bridges to nowhere and attaching all sort of footnotes to otherwise good legislation . 
  which leads to the well-known wisdom from city-folk that `` centre always lets you down '' ( kepu pett\u00e4\u00e4 aina ) . 
  your problem is probably that uk and usa are both categorised under `` liberal regime '' . 
  nhs just happens to be one of the things that differates uk and usa . 
   suihku is finnish , though . 
  we also speak swedish here in finland . 
  and often by the same people who speak finnish . 
  probably left decades before you were born . 
   the deportation of refugees is pretty much impossible because the article 19 of the charter of fundamental rights of the eu forbids deportation if there 's a chance of torture or death . 
  true . 
  the problem comes from the fact that most of our refugees are from somalia and at least somaliland ( and probably puntland ) are considered absolutely safe these days ( we 've already sent some people back there ) . 
  the problems arise from the fact that the connections to the old country are hard to check with certainty and that the criminals often have poor connections to the old country in any case . 
  at least the one story i read from a newspaper involved a young somali who had apparently done a lot of street crime and had been deported after nothing else worked . 
  his family had come to finland claiming they were from somaliland ( while they were actually from moghadishu ) . 
  so as somaliland was safe , they sent him there ( even though he did n't have any memories of africa ) and independence-declaring somaliland government kicked him to unstable somalia-proper . 
  i do n't necessary feel a lot of sympathy for him ( as said , he got caught several times before they kicked him out ) but this is essentially burying a problem that we caused ourselves with a sloppy job on integration ( not that we had a lot of experience with that back in the day ) . 
  [ here 's a link if you read finnish or feel like adventuring a try with google translate ] ( http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/50458-lehti-suomesta-karkotettu-somali-uusissa-vaikeuksissa ) . 
  you forgot the part of the translation with quotation marks . 
  i believe a better translation of the end would be . .  exceptions would be made in only cases where banishing would `` with confidence '' break international agreements . 
  the difference is the justifiable amount of false positives , i think . 
  i was honestly pretty surprised by that myself . 
  i 've often wondered why americans always shit-talk mcdonalds . 
  true , it 's not a five-star place but it 's kilometres ahead of anything else in the same price category . 
  . . and winter war . . 
  [ he used nokia-phones before they were cool . 
  ] ( http://www.taloussanomat.fi/img.php?f=mobira2.jpg&amp;w=800 ) that 's probably how he 's best remembered in finland . 
  apart of the , you know , other thing . 
   talking about the whole human history, 
  i think it 's always a bigger shame to harm others than to harm ourselves . 
  but perhaps in this scale such demarcation is n't important any more . 
  but the other is n't an achievement either . 
  war is something that mostly affects humans ( talking about the whole human history ) , but ecosphere also includes flora and fauna . 
  i ca n't believe you actually got downvoted for the correct answer . 
  there 's a filter , so i 'd say it 's just tobacco . 
  real men roll their own etc. 
  `` miss\u00e4 broidisi on ? '', 
  `` h\u00e4n on taksikuski '' . 
  i did say `` regional '' . 
  i live in central finland and i 'm originally from metropolitan area . 
  i 've never heard anybody say `` it '' here and when somebody did say in helsinki they were looked a bit badly . 
  fun fact : they also have second person honorific in french : tu ( sin\u00e4 ) , vous ( te ) . 
  also in english : thou ( sin\u00e4 ) , you ( te ) . 
  naturally , the english started using the honorific so often that they forgot it was a honorific and now some idiots think `` thou '' is somehow more polite . 
  must be some regional thing . 
  i 'd say that 's awfully impolite . 
  edit : finnish is divided to several regional dialects . 
  you ca n't generalise if you have n't studied finnish language at university !, 
  i did n't : note `` regional '' !, 
  please do n't downvote me just because i said that the above example may not be universal . 
  on the very least it 's against finnish grammar . 
   and we do n't refer to people or animals as `` it '' like the finns often do -- how rude can they be . 
  just to be clear : he / she = h\u00e4n it = se some people call other people `` it '' . 
  that does n't make it polite or grammatically correct . 
  twist : when translating finnigan 's wake ( where sex must be apparent from pronoun ) , `` hen '' was used to mark the less muscular sex . 
  what 's your beef with napoleon ? 
  great guy . 
  europe = eu + satellites ? 
  . . leaves or polonium . . 
  yes , zizek is charismatic , but that alone does n't make you a career in academia . 
  i did n't get much past the first hundred words myself , but saying that something is bad because of * marxist viewpoint * is just ignorant . 
  it 's a valid position for social criticism . 
  \u017di\u017eek for example is both famous and respected for his marxist views .
