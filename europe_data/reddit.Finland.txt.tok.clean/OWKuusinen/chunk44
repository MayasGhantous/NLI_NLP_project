  on the other hand , people in my ( admittedly left-leaning ) circle tend to blame stubb ( the pm ) in particular and his party ( national coalition , right-wingers ) in general . 
  i tend to hear this from people who [ tend to vote/probably vote ] rightwingers as well . 
  edit : i accidentally a word . 
  well . . technically he `` gave the law '' so he was a lawgiver . 
  nobody mentioned anything about writing laws . 
  it 's a pretty necessary requirement for stable society , yes . 
  it is n't requirement for capitalism , per se , as what mafia does is still capitalism . 
  capitalism can create it 's own law and order : at least , that 's the argument of libertarism if i 'm not mistaken . 
  i know what the argument is . 
  that 's why i used it . 
  my point is that china is a planned economy . 
  on those parts that there is economic freedom it 's an illusion as the party can at moment 's notice to kill it if they so feel . 
  in other words : just because a car does n't use breaks at the moment does n't mean that it does n't have breaks or that it wo n't use them at a moment ( because the car is speeding at the desired speed ) . 
  no , the ideal is that the transactions are beneficial to both parties . 
  there are several scenarios where transactions are n't voluntary or beneficial . 
  on b2b-side these include monopolies , competitors having too long completion times etc. 
  on b2c-front such as company stores , lack of unions creating poor negotiation ground for workers etc. 
  or a situation where one party can use some resource but the other ca n't and knowingly puts the other into situation where they have to give the resource up : for example by knowing that there 's gold under the ground and the owner ca n't secure the money to dig it up , so they have to sell the land ( or the stock of the formed company ) so they only get scraps from the table if that etc. 
  well , china is quite clearly state capitalist system with planned map for the future . 
  ergo , it 's a planned economy . 
  but as it 's successful , it ca n't be a planned economy . 
  hence , true scotsman . 
  depends what rights are expected of them . 
  let me remind you of leopold ii 's congo . 
  true scotsman . 
  in state capitalism the state owns the companies . 
  central planning and political meddling disturb business . 
  in socialism the companies are owned by the workers and state exists as a separate entity that taxes the co-ops . 
  in communism there is no central government but the co-ops bargain with other co-ops for resources in a spirit of common purpose . 
   they basically do n't have law and order . 
  people do not want to invest large sums in places where some guy with good connections can just come and take your business away . 
  explain how that is n't capitalistic ? 
  meaning i have my spotify linked and never open last.fm . 
   bi-partisan does n't italian parliament have over ten parties ? 
  does bi-partisan actually mean the same as `` majority '' ? 
  because at least in finnish politics bipartisan means at best `` a large minority '' . 
  the problem was that the account talked about things that were on the table and wanted to do so so in an enthusiastic `` teen-speaking '' voice . 
  which meant that if it was being considered , it must have been really cool because why would they consider something that was n't ? 
  which really points toward a structural problem in the pr-strategy ( or even to the fact that perhaps a democratic institution should n't have a pr-strategy ) . 
  i hope it will be better than their google + - account which i never really got . 
  the posts were aimed for teenagers but who teenager reads g + ? 
  also did n't help that they kept promoting ttip for months after all the comments to the posts had turned negative . 
   finland has population of 5,5 million people , lithuania , which is the largest of the baltic states , has barely 3 million . 
  you have a border of about 230 km with russia . 
  that means 14 350 people per kilometre . 
  our border is 1340 km . 
  that 's 4100 people per kilometre . 
  assuming our population follows the same age pyramid ( and it does n't yours is younger -- ours includes a huge amount of geriatrics ) that means that to defend the whole border one finn has to handle as many russians as as four lithuanians . 
  not to mention that getting supplies from the rest of europe is that much easier due to location . 
   your gdp is also much larger than in any of the baltics i did mention this . 
   as for population density - not sure , if this matters as it is n't spread evenly all over anyway , maybe it would matter , if you wanted to defend only the largest urban centres or something , but everyone has some sparsely inhabited border regions . 
  population tells how many people you can have to support war effort and how many places you need to allocate them . 
  if you have 100 people and 20 places each needing 10 people to protect , you either abandon half the places needing defence or hope that you can protect them with only half the man-power . 
  meanwhile lithuania has 70 people and 4 places to protect ( i think -- i did n't do the math here ) . 
  the `` sparsely inhabited border region '' in case of finland means `` the area north and east from tampere and helsinki '' . 
  which i think consists of something like 90 % of the total land-area . 
  i live in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and without exaggerating , you can go about 50 to 100 kilometres to any direction and only see forest . 
  and this area is called `` central finland '' . 
  things get a lot more sparse if you go north ( about 1000 km of finland in that direction ) or east ( about 200 + km of finland before reaching the border ) . 
  what you 're advocating is basically abandoning everything but the southern coast . 
  i find this very rude . 
   baltic countries get compared as equal to a country that is almost double the size of all three countries combined you have bigger population and less area to defend . 
  we have better funding but speaking solely of people/km you are ridiculously better positioned . 
  well , apparently back at the time the alternative was either usa or sweden and finland . 
  and you could only pick one !, 
  i 'll use the opportunity to milk everything out of this newspiece : [ good guy finland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ytebgc.jpg ) . 
    retired admiral juhani kaskeala work as commander of the armed forces from 2001-2009 . 
  he has been interviewed for * iltalehti nato extra * about the timeline of the events of the past decades . 
    after the fall of the soviet union in the 1990s the nato military alliance was joined by the countries that had belonged to the soviet union or to the warsaw pact . 
  countries wanted to integrate into the west , foremost militarily and secondarily to the european union . 
    kaskeala describes that finland 's problem became aparment at the time and was first rised by british foreign secretary douglas hurd . 
    hurd asked if it was not possible for finland and sweden to take responsibility of the baltic defence . 
  at the same time he said that the baltic countries were impossible to defend . 
    nato 's eastward enlargement architect and former us assistant secretary of state ronald asmus was planning to position to denmark nato 's new [ control centre ? ], 
  ** with finland and sweden taking responsibility for the baltic defense ** . 
    according to * iltalehti * , president martti ahtisaari had said to us secretary of state warren christopher that the proposal is not realistic and the nordic countries could not guarantee the security of nato . 
  ** finland was afraid of the usa pulling away from northern europe and made evasive action . 
  staying outside helped the baltic countries ' accession to nato . 
  **   ** - the old nato countries were pushing the baltic security to us - that finland and sweden were the guarantors of security in the baltic . 
  this idea certainly contributed to the fact that finland did not want to join nato , juhani kaskeala summarized . 
  **   kaskeala is in favor of finland 's nato membership . 
  according to him , a member of finland does not automatically bear the responsibility of estonia or any other nato member states defense , but a contribution to a common defense would focus on their own area to defend , such as norway worked during the cold war . 
  ( hand-corrected google translation 's worst mistakes , bold by me ) edit : fixed more oddities . 
  economic stagnation is n't great , but the cure you 're proposing is worse than the ailment it strives to fix . 
  that 's social equality , not economic . 
  leading by example . 
  your actions are watched and emulated with regularity at least here in finland . 
  i was talking of social and economic inequality , not freedom of speech . 
  but latter tends to follow former due to having less reason to censor speakers . 
  does economy exist for country or vice versa ? 
  if economy does well but country is socially in hell , does the social contract bind -- or is there a danger of revolution ? 
  which is the point . 
  arabs + jews = semitic world . 
  islam is n't islamic republic and drawing equation marks is n't helpful to your position . 
  true , true . 
  i must admit that i entertain similar ideas about most north american cities - would like to visit , not to live at ( though i would n't know who would n't want to live at copenhagen -- it has everything going for it ! ) . 
  and it 's perfectly ok to entertain these ideas in your own head . 
  but when you air them out even after others point that they do n't think this is entirely polite . . welll . . 
  yeah . 
  my point was n't to insult you north americans in general , it 's just really annoying when these heritage-people come knocking ( `` my great-grandmother was finnish , so i 'm too !,
