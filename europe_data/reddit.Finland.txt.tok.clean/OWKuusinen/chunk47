  quite . 
   if anything the swedish name should be prioritized since it 's the name by which the city was originally founded . 
  depends . 
  for example st. michel was probably only ever used in official papers . 
  the common people ( who did n't speak swedish ) would have used mikkeli from day 1 . 
  this is n't even archaic practice . 
  my mother 's name is written in swedish form on her papers because the priest refused to write finnish names to official papers . 
  neither she nor her parents spoke swedish . 
  so the question is pretty much is the `` real name '' the one used by the lords or the one used by the people ? 
  i would remember that algeria 's petition to join was put down citing location . 
  are there any vacancies ? 
  there 's also the chance of changing a town name when it becomes a political hindrance . 
  nikolainkaupunki/nikolaistad ( the former and later vaasa/wasa ) is no longer on the map . 
  st michel is mikkeli in finnish and does n't have `` saint '' in the name . 
  the same for the other examples . 
  hitler was n't known for his prose . 
  the annotations probably explain how the chapters reflect hitler 's later policies - both implemented and those left on the drafting table . 
  when i was a kid , we called those potatoes ( which we had never seen , only heard about ) `` kinder potatoes '' , as they had a surprise inside !, 
  the exams are n't the end of your life , but it does give you some path dependency . 
  ( though admittedly people who get straight top marks - i almost wrote `` straight a 's - may not be the sort of people who go on to accomplish much in life . 
  you need certain skills to remember facts and certain skills to succeed in organisations . 
  but in general is better to do very well than very badly . ), 
  sometimes the light bulbs have been removed to discourage closing the doors . 
  in the old days when relatively few had the right to wear those hats , they were status and class symbols and were worn through the summer . 
  i see this as an alternative for a summer cottage . 
  renting it now and then is n't the same . 
  part of the charm is to make it your own . 
  maintenance is probably a bitch ( on the least you have to find a place to store it for winter ) , but i 'll be rich when this happens , so who cares !, 
   this really is n't true in this naive way . 
  firstly , stranger rape and acquaintance rape are completely different . 
  true . 
   this is something that is not explicitly distinguished in research that uses a broadly feminist model of gender relations ( at least for the studies i know ) . 
  is the difference made in raw stats ? 
  i 'm unsure . 
   secondly , we know that a majority of rapists , particularly those that have no psychopathology , do n't prefer rape to normal sex , but instead at worst are n't repulsed by rape to the extent a control population is , but often were n't cognisant of the fact that they were raping . 
  i did try to illustrate this . 
   thirdly , rape overall is vastly more prevalent between the ages of roughly 14 and 30 than any other time , for victim and perpetrator . 
  this can not be explained by the `` rape is about power '' idea you could assume that the perpetrator might respect elder people and is less likely to see them as something that need to be `` put in their place '' . 
  but i 'm not basing this on any research . 
   particularly as acquaintance rape is concerned , which is again a vast majority of cases . 
  op was talking about immigrants not having girlfriends and thus `` roaming the streets at night looking for someone to rape '' . 
  i suspect they did n't mean female friends . 
  but yes , i tried to write keeping this in mind , though i did n't want to muddle my point by dwelling on this . 
   it is primarily stranger rapists , and among those especially people with psychopathology ( serial rapists , people with mental illnesses , et cetera ) who rape for domination , and that 's the minority . 
  i was trying to get to this . 
  that 's why i specified that i will be in the money then . 
   it does if you build them railroads . 
  / s the end-result in finland being that many of the original railroads go from west-east ( to transport military from russia ) when the roads go north-south ( as the commerce works ) . 
  that and we have different gauge than the countries with whom we actually have a border union with . 
  it 's not the same : /, 
   put it this way : chinese people rape less than white people in china and in their own country . 
  if there were a million chinese people brought into europe , we could expect the rate of rape to go down . 
  you have two cases , interesting assumption and a really interesting conclusion . 
  let me break it down to you and offer an alternative explanation : ** chinese in china ** : we can assume either - you : chinese do n't rape in china ( that often ) . 
  the reason has to be something in the upbringing ( and perhaps social pressure ) . 
  - me : rapes happen by natives but they are n't recorded due to social stigma . 
  ** white people in china ** : we can assume either - you : whites rape more than they do in their home country , suggesting that they followed rules only from upbringing and social pressure - the first which they abandoned when they moved to china and the latter which they do n't feel at china . 
  - me : whites rape on the same frequency as they did back home , but that they are reported more easily . 
  as chinese probably are xenophobic , reporting rapes done by foreigners probably carries less stigma . 
  ** base assumption ** : - you : ~ ~ chinese in europe and europeans in china are fully switchable scenarios . ~ ~ * chinese would n't rape in europe * any more than in china . 
  - me : people have different upbringing and are likely to do wrong assumptions about certain societal norms . 
  it might be understandable if you move from more lax environment to more strict one that certain problems arise . 
  thus rape-numbers might rise if whites go to china or chinese go to europe , but not both . 
  ** we can hypothesise ** either - you : ~ ~ people naturally rape but our upbringing and ties to society keep us `` grounded '' . 
  thus chinese will rape in europe in droves , * far higher rape reports than the locals * . ~ ~ * i do n't actually know , because you said whites raped more in china than at europe , but the same would n't do to other direction * - me : chinese had problems in the rape records . 
  ( would be interested to see these numbers and see if the numbers vary between non-chinese asians , blacks and whites . ), 
  when they come here , they will continue raping as they did back home , but * chinese are reported competitively more often , but not on as heavy ratio as whites in china * , as the rape report does n't have as big stigma as it does in china . 
  edit : i misread the original quote . 
  edited . 
   some groups are more prone to rape than others . 
  men for example rape more than women . 
  a lot depends on stuff like how you define rape ( and how you define `` normal behaviour '' ) . 
  i grant that if person 's definition of `` normal behaviour '' and society 's definition of `` rape '' are at odds , rape numbers will increase or decrease . 
  to take the example you provided , in [ england rape means that you penetrate a vagina or an asshole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_english_law ) . 
  so woman would be incredibly hard to break this law . 
  there 's also a question between the disparity between rapes and reported rapes - do men rape more or are rapes done by females reported less ? 
  second , if a person is without a `` normal social life '' and a girlfriend ( as descripted above ) , would they be interested in raping ? 
  or consuming large amounts of porn ( or by self-improvement ) ? 
  research shows us that rape is done as a power-play , not because a man ca n't control himself . 
  if we have a person who 's interested in showcasing power , they 're more likely to be people who are attracted to power and fame in all forms : jocks , politicians , influential people . 
  that 's why danger of rape does n't directly correlate with victim 's beauty . 
  they would n't be nerds who are content in sitting home studying japanese ( as many of my friends did ) . 
  tldr : the stereotype of rapist raping from lack of alternatives does n't represent the reality . 
  rape happens because of power-play or because the rules between individuals and society does n't match and is ( to some extend ) caused by mistakes , as the assange-case illustrates . 
  acting like rapists are lonely people does a lot of harm to innocents while making us oblivious to the real predators . 
  ( bill cosby ca n't be a rapist - he could get any woman he wanted !, 
  or pay for a courtesan !, 
  go fling that mud somewhere else ! ), 
  that 's what i 'll buy when i finally make it . 
  it 's a muddy topic . 
  hawaii for example was quite clearly a colony . 
  does it stop being a colony when the population is given a voting franchise , keeping in mind that as the local population will never be more than small minority of the whole federation , they ca n't really rock the boat ? 
   how do you know anything about defines the motivations of a rapist ? 
   seriously , you 're talking out of your ass . 
  unless you 're actually a rapist , in which case ... reading psychological and sociological studies on the subject helps . 
  one has a lot of time to do that when you do n't have to take care of social life . 
  and does that justify colonisation ? 
  the definition according to cambridge dictionary is   a country or area controlled politically by a more powerful country that is often far away notice `` often '' . 
   the thing that will happen is a shit ton of immigrant `` young adults '' without a girlfriend or normal social life will be roaming the streets at night looking for someone to rape because they have no girlfriend i do n't know about you , but when i was 17 and without social life or a girlfriend , i just watched anime . 
  and i doubt it was because my flair has a nordic cross .
