  people who rape do n't do so because they do n't have a social life or a girlfriend - they rape because they like raping and the power they experience while doing so . 
  making an equivalency between lack of social skills and rape is n't serving nerds nor help in hindering rapes . 
  the erasmus students pay tuition to their home universities . 
  the exchanges are tit-for-that ; we take some of your students , you take some of ours . 
  true , but / u/forzaloven seems to be expanding on the question . 
  but maybe they themselves can clarify . 
  i remember visiting some small museum ( perhaps dedicated to some regiment ? ), 
  at glasgow with my local friend and was rather upset after seeing a picture of the allied leaders ( including stalin ) with the legend champions of democracy and liberty under it ( and on smaller font : they saved the world etc etc. ) . 
  did n't really concentrate on the tour after that . 
  dictators are a bit like natural catastrophes - the farther they are , the less important they seem . 
  hitler was on the other side of the sea , stalin was right across the border and without plans to stay there . 
  supposedly when asked about `` bigger historical bad guy '' , they are n't talking solely about ww2 but the preceding 1000 years as well . 
  i have glasses . 
  it works , but of course settling the scarf correctly takes some practice . 
  those were all built in the 70s with some really strange aesthetics . 
  i understand that the few that have been built on recent years actually look halfway decent . 
  that 's why you put a scarf over your face . 
   thanks to the allies . 
  the plan was to eliminate them all , this was n't the plan in the new world . 
  my point was that existence does n't prove that nothing happened . 
  in the case of native americans , moving times and the changes it brought to us policy post-1933 ( iirc ) meant that they exist as a groups . 
  does n't mean that if the pre-1933 policy would n't have continued that there would be . 
   of course , why would n't they ? 
  the us policy between 1887 and 1933 was to assimilate native americans into the mainstream society , essentially destroying them as a cultural , linguistic and religious group . 
  i would suppose that the past policy , as well as the forced transportations and developments of holy places would have left their marks . 
   you mean context does n't matter and we have to view things in a black and white world . 
  i meant that just because something happened does n't mean we know why it happened . 
   no , that lifestyle and culture still exists to this day . 
  and there are still jews at europe . 
  do they still speak their native language ? 
  do they visit the same ancestral sites they have visited for dozens of generations ? 
  do they pass on the worldview that they developed over generations and is something they use to reflect their surroundings ? 
  do they identify themselves as members of a certain tribe , are identified as such by others of the tribe ? 
   and many native americans worked with the us government , they were n't one homogeneous cartoon like group you have envisioned . 
  that some worked with us government does n't make it right . . nor does it necessarily mean that workers themselves judged it right , only necessary . 
  and speaking of homogenous groups , i have identified in my other messages on this topic that each tribe was their own group . 
   i apologize , you are absolutely right about the downvotes . 
  thank you for listening to me . 
    so , regarding the genocide vs. assimilation . 
  assimilation can not be considered genocide because it does not involve killings on large scale needed to exterminate a population . 
  the work itself means `` killing of the race '' so assimilation ( whilst very wrong and maybe even criminal if done in a compulsory fashion ) does not cross the threshold of a genocide . 
  just to clarify . 
  how does what you wrote above works with :  genocide is an intent to systematically eliminate an ethnic , racial , religious , national , linguistic or a cultural group . 
  if americans no longer worship manatou ( or whoever ) , is this not the end of americans as a religious group ? 
  if americans no longer speak their ancestral languages , is this not the end of americans as a linguistic group ? 
  if americans no longer identify themselves as members of tribes but exclusively as us-citizens with na-ancestry , is this not the end of an cultural group ? 
  further : if such end-results were pre-meditated , is this not genocide ? 
  i would further offer [ this definition of genocide from dictionary.com ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/genocide ) :   generally speaking , genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation , except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation . 
  ** it is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aimed at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups , with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves . 
  ** [ lemkin ] i read this as : genocide is the act of destroying an idea of a group . 
  this can be accomplished by killing the members , but also by making the members ( or those who could be members ) to disavow the group permanently . 
  i suppose our whole disagreement is upon the different definitions of the word , not on different views of history . 
  please do n't downvote me for having conversation with you . 
  i 'm spending my time talking with you in a civil manner , and you could respect that enough to leave the downvote-button alone . 
  i 'm not expecting to get get upvotes for disagreeing with you , but please do n't be rude . 
  also , i 'm in no manner expert in this topic . 
  but what i do know is that ( 1 . ), 
  americans used to have lands and culture ( 2 . ), 
  and now they have few reservations on deserts , cable subscription and apparently an alcohol problem and ( 3 . ), 
  things could have been otherwise . 
   you stated that what happened with native americans was genocide . 
  yes . 
   to consider something a genocide there has to be an intent to exterminate the whole people , which was not the plan of the us government at any point in time . 
  people ** s ** , as americans were several nations . 
  anyway , [ history today ] ( http://www.historytoday.com/andrew-boxer/native-americans-and-federal-government ) writes that :   between 1887 and 1933 , us government ** policy aimed to assimilate indians into mainstream american society ** . 
  although to modern observers this policy looks both patronising and racist , the white elite that dominated us society saw it as a civilising mission , comparable to the work of european missionaries in africa . 
  this itself is , to me , at least an attempt at genocide . 
  [victoriana.com says ] ( http://www.victoriana.com/history/nativeamericans.html ) :   at times the federal government recognized the indians as self-governing , independent political communities with varying cultural identities ; however , ** at other times the government attempted to force the native american tribes to abandon their cultural identity , give up their land and assimilate into the american culture ** . 
   genocide is an intent to systematically eliminate an ethnic , racial , religious , national , linguistic or a cultural group . 
  yes . 
  my point exactly . 
  the us government was a competitor ( representative of ) a foreign culture , religion , language etc. 
  which sought to replace what the americans had built . 
  it 's true that the americans were weak due to plagues , but many of the nations could have recovered if left alone or helped . 
  intentionally pushing americans out of the way ( geographically ) or forcing them to adapt to us-culture , a genocide happened . 
  what we today have on reservations is just lip-service ; it 's us-culture with different spices . 
   because lebensraum was a planned genocide while us expansion into the western parts of the north america was not a planned genocide . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but did n't the expansion to west destroy native american lifestyle and culture ? 
  was this , if not intentional , then at least self-evident end-result of the policies pursued ? 
  well , depends on how you see it . 
  genocide might also be the intentional destruction of a culture , which obviously happened both directly and indirectly . 
  the native land use was `` inefficient '' so naturally it had to be stopped . 
  [ then there was shit like this ] ( http://itbcbuffalo.com/node/22 ) . 
  not to mention the trail of tears . 
  ( i will skip over plague blankets and stuff like that because there 's apparently some ambiguity there . ), 
   you lucky bastarts , we had -28 last night and the worse is still to come : '' ( the worst is that it 's hard to get gloves that allow even limited dexterity while still being only chilly . 
  it 's been about -25 ... -30 for several days now . 
  other than my frustration over the gloves and it taking five minutes more to get dressed/undressed , it 's pretty much the same as summer . 
  wise person once said : the weather is always lovely ; if you do n't think so , you need better clothes . 
  thank you for stating the obvious and missing the point . 
  initial reports are written by victors , but the history is written by school teachers and playwrights who try to fit history into a nice narrative . 
   nobody really thinks manifest destiny is cool anymore , it just isnt that talked about because native americans stopped caring is a thing only evil if people complain ? 
  that is , if you kill everybody but your sycophants , whatever you did was n't objectionable ? 
  in itself , i find it strange how you can write about `` conquering the west '' and the frontier while disregarding native americans . 
  true , not everything is about the native americans , but i would think that it 's very hard to do a ww2-story without at least touching on jews , political oppression , how nazis are evil etc. 
  etc ( or a story set in the colonies that does n't touch on the inequality ) . 
  but i have seen many westerns where the conquerors are n't deciphered as evil or conflicted people . 
  the fact that you can use the frontier as a nice backdrop and just disregard indians because `` they are n't part of the yarn '' in itself shows how manifest destiny is treated differently than other carvings from the same block . 
  yeah , but when for example if i were to read history books for school , they have `` manifest destiny '' , `` imperialism '' and `` lebensraum '' only few pages apart . 
  the first one is largely-positive , the second is somewhat positive/negative depending on the author and the third is unforgivable .
