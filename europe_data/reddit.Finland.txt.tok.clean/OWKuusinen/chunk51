  why would n't they work ? 
  indonesia has five times the population as uk . 
  you have to be a lot poorer per capita than indonesia to be smaller than france or uk . 
  well , most of the world economy was china and it 's vassal kingdoms . 
  i think that counts as `` world economy leader '' . 
  and it is n't like any other country had any bigger claim to the status , perhaps excluding britain in the late 19th century and united states and ussr in the 20th . 
  you mean to imply : americans ? 
  in most european countries the ministers are beholden to the parliament and not the people . 
  the ministers do n't have to be mp 's , though it 's often the custom . 
  this might be baader-meinhof , but why do i feel like every time the arabs are beheading or lashing somebody and it gets reported , the ( foreign ) criminal/victim is always a brit ? 
   i like it how you keep changing metaphors , somehow trying to skirt around the situation . 
  my original statement was reference to the auteur theory ( the european stance that director is the creator of the film ) ; it was also a reference to the fact that i was answering to an american ( who would probably hold the view that producer is the creator ) . 
  as it was , it was snide remark . 
  if we 're really going to start talking about it , i chose to simplify it a bit . 
  anyway , metaphors are n't the views they represent . 
  even if you find a way to turn a metaphor upside down , it 's still just a metaphor , not the view itself . 
  at best with that tactic you can show that it 's a bad metaphor , not that it 's a bad view . 
   we do n't call pope julius ii the co-creator , but we do mention that he was the one who made the order for the creation of adam . . 
  i did n't say that money would be meaningless . 
  of course it is n't ; it affects scope ( and perhaps durability ) . 
  but it still is n't the same as the act of creation . 
  without money , we would still have art ( perhaps as echings on sand , but still ) ; the reverse ( without artists , we would still have art ) would n't be true . 
  the wikipedia-article about * the creation of adam * starts with the lines * the creation of adam is a fresco painting by michelangelo , which forms part of the sistine chapel 's ceiling , painted circa . . * , not `` the creation of adam is a fresco comissioned by pope . . '' , which we would do if we would think that michelangelo is just a tool wielded by the pope . 
   and it is at his `` house '' , in his estate , that it has stayed thus far . 
  whenever someone wants to see it or photograph it , they do n't have to worry about michaelangelo 's successors , but they do have to abide by the vatican 's law . 
  true . 
  also , possession has nothing to do with the main credit . 
  if i were to steal mona lisa * that would n't make me the creator of mona lisa . 
  nor does the fact that someone posed for the picture make them the creator , or the fact that the museum legally owns the piece nor the fact that somebody probably paid leonardo to do it . 
  but we 're getting pretty far from the original argument , which is : ** does funding an idea make the idea yours ** ? 
  * because i ca n't very well steal the chapel . 
  edit : made the text a bit more coherent . 
   without producer there is no money , there is no movie . 
  true , true . 
  but if everything art needs is money , artists in general would be billionaires instead of dirt-poor . 
   some studios retain the ownership of the ip and some do n't . 
   since the discovery of america started the spanish empire and lasted longer than columbus it 's fair to say the spanish retained the ip of the discovery . 
  well , depends what you celebrate . 
  if it 's exploring and finding new places , it 's columbus , no matter the funding or nationality . 
  if it 's creating empires , destroying cultures and causing holocausts , then it 's spain . 
  though i do n't really understand why you would celebrate the latter . 
  on the other hand , portuguese and spanish seem to have some strange proudness of this aspect of their history that i do n't really grap . 
  you also do n't have a film without a story ; nor is it watchable without semi-good actors , directors and sfx-specialists . 
  the producer makes it possible , but you we do n't call pope julius ii the creator or even the co-creator of * the creation of adam * . 
  and producer is the real creator of the film . 
  i 'm not sure how applicable this is to countries that are n't incorporated as federations . 
  i 'm just going to point that whether he was innocently or not in afghanistan originally , all we know is that he was caught at a war camp far from home . 
  and usa but him to jail for nigh 15 years . 
  that 's less than was given to some of the nazi-leaders after ww2 ( discounting those who were deemed to have worked within bounds of the traditions of wartime ) . 
   not to mention the whole deal with hindus and buddhists who have used it for thousands of years . 
  a bit more widespread than 1 small backwards northern nation . 
  ( / s ) some variation of swastika has been in independent use among among several cultures for thousands of years , [ including finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tursaansyd%c3%a4n ) . 
  swastika would be even better example . 
  it was ( and still is , to a degree * ) a symbol used fairly largely in many positive conjugations , but because one certain asshole , it 's fairly hard to use these days . 
  * [ the flag of the president has a swastika ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/vapaudenristin_ritarikunta#/media/file:presidential_standard_of_finland.svg ) . 
  have you tried speaking to them on your first language ? 
  the gypsies speak many languages in sweden . . as do the alcoholics . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  understand that tomatoes do n't grow here naturally . 
  well , integration happened . 
  those `` findians '' live on the reservations . 
  it 's just that the colonization of america happened faster and left this episode very much a cliffnote . 
  i 'm certainly not an authority , but i thought that integration into native american societies ( and abandoning white communities ) was very much a thing in the 19th century ? 
  i also saw a document few months ago about `` findians '' who despised the term - they were native americans with finnish genes . 
  the conversation went :     there are no examples where ** large populations enter a country ** and successfully integrate with the original population . 
     the ** new immigrants to usa ** at the beginning of 20th century ( or pretty much every wave since ) ? 
    because the us rejects multi-culturalism . 
  you come , but you 're assimilated into now , we 'll take your food and probably add a holiday if we can make it an excuse to drink , but thats about it . 
  and the us provides very little ** welfare to immigrants ** , if you 're a single male/single member household ( aka you 're a male by yourself ) its literally impossible to get welfare . 
   i would argue that the situation of black americans could be discribed as that . 
  since they pretty much are an ethnicity of their own , lacking any knowledge of their original nation of origin . 
  you answered to a comment about immigrants and said that `` black americans could be discribted as that [ immigrants ] '' . 
   there has n't been homogenization that was n't the question . 
   blacks blacks have been in the country longer than pretty much everybody expect natives and some of the wasps . 
  you ca n't call them `` immigrants '' - if anything , the lower crime rates of other ethnics tell that * they * have n't adapted to the blacks . 
  also remember that jim crow-laws were written to stop homogenization and were unofficially enforced long after they were stricken off books . 
  you can hardly call blacks immigrants when they 've been in the country longer than most other ethnicies - longer than everybody expect some of the wasps ( and the natives , of course ) . 
  also remember that they were knowingly kept from integrating till fairly recently . 
   sweden , where they do n't name facts about perpetrators to not seem racist . 
  nordic countries never publish * any * descriptions unless ( 1 . ), 
  the police wants somebody found or ( 2 . ), 
  there 's a court judgement . 
  it 's not about not being racist , it 's about protecting innocent people . 
  true , but that was n't the question :d, 
  the new immigrants to usa at the beginning of 20th century ( or pretty much every wave since ) ? 
  but you know , define `` large '' . 
   parliamentary democracy is n't very efficient ... technocratic class we have bureaucrats for things like diplomatic relations with uzbekistan . 
  but if we make them a `` class '' ( eg . 
  not controlled by democratically voted ministers backed by parliaments ) what we actually have is an aristocracy . 
  and there 's a reason why we moved away from that . 
  i think it 's a sliding scale that crosses into racism somewhere before the time when people try to burn down refugee centres * with people inside * or dressing in ku klux klan-inspired halloween-clothing . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but did n't american music have some exception that you did n't have to pay royalties when playing it on radio , unlike with music from everywhere else in the world ? 
  if the words are long and there are n't that many consonants , it 's probably finnish . 
  he also seemed to date the start of industrial revolution to around 1920 instead of late 18th century . 
  it 's not just the army or their equipment , it 's the nature too . 
  does israeli army have a lot of training in winter warfare ? 
  do you even have equipment to survive outside when weather goes below zero ? 
  and i know nothing about modern weapons , but at least in the past there was a problem that not all weapons operated in sub-zero temperatures . 
  the only thing i know about armenia is that it was one of the first christian kingdoms , as repeatedly told to me by an armenian exchange student . 
  oh , and they apparently stopped some invasion back in the day .
