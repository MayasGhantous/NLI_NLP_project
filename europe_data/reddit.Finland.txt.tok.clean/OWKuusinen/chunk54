  and after all the media attention it was n't the courts that were the problem -- it was the reputation of the paper . 
  it was just easier to let it fold and wash your hands . 
  there are plenty more where that came from . 
  the fact that the above mentioned person wants britain to stay is one of the better arguments for me wanting britain out . 
  in south korea the companies live with the sufferance of the political body . 
  for example , daewoo was bigger than samsung and it got disassembled because the company angered the wrong people . 
  my dad did development aid in africa during 1980s . 
  one experience he was keen to share was driving a road that had been built as development aid by construction workers from several countries . 
  you would drive swedish road for few kilometres , then french road , east-german road , us road etc. 
  it was interesting how the road differented depending how the roads were built in different countries : nordic roads were slightly curved so the water ran off the road faster : some were more ruler-like . . 
  some countries used asphalt , some cement blocks . 
  soviet union used building elements , with holes for doors and windows . 
  i 've seen such empty spaces in places where i 've studied , and not just in finland . 
  nevertheless , neither of us has seen danish schools . 
  i spoke of multi-purpose silent rooms that could be used for many things , not just prayer . 
  my high school and uni had/have them and i find them extremely useful - and i 'm an atheist . 
  i do n't see how they 're any more preferential than toilets . 
  what you say about moving about and outdoors makes certain sense , but is a poor justification , as it would also be used against said toilets . 
  schools tend to have rooms that are less used ( because no teacher has adopted them , because the usage of teaching has changed ) . 
  these are n't what i 'd call proper class rooms . 
  ah , this is one of those articles where `` european '' is defined as `` not nordic '' . 
  there are always rooms that are n't in active use , particularly during breaks . 
  anyway , it 's better to think prayer as meditation to improve well-being . 
  my high school had a `` silent room '' so people could sit in semi-darkness and compose themselves . 
  those places could easily be used for this as well . 
  also the islamic prayer has a short version that takes less than a minute . 
  it 's easy to do during a 15 min break .

  i 'm not a psychologist , but [ this article says that the `` optimal cut-off point for depression is 17 points on the bdi-test ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19141552 ) . 
  however , the standard cut-off [ is 14 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beck_depression_inventory ) . 
  [ this finnish-written article says that having cultural-sensitive cut-off points for autism is important ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223989968_validation_of_the_finnish_autism_spectrum_screening_questionnaire_assq_for_clinical_settings_and_total_population_screening ) but does n't mention if finnish ranking is higher or lower than some other . 
  i tried to do some googling but could n't find anything fast enough , so i left it at that . 
  you 're being funny , but afaik the criteria for autism are a bit striker for finns because the society rewards autistic behaviour - so to find the `` real autistic '' people , the test scores are rised upward . 
  ( the same goes for the tests that measure depression . ), 
  it 's $ 687 ( 520 pounds ) at finland in retail , including taxes . 
  capital 1 ends in a love letter for the northern usa of 1850s , which always seems like the most delicious contradiction between what marx wrote and what people think about him . 
  other than observational data from old books and statues ? 
  not really . 
  on the other hand , i 've seen a lot of statues and read a lot of books . 
  most recently i saw in the versailles palace a statue of an native american from the 18th century marked only as `` american '' on the base . 
  also i 'd seem to remember that engels and marx ( capital , origins of state ) also spoke of `` americans '' meaning natives and referred to `` georgians '' or `` virginians '' when talking of citizens of those places . 
  do n't forget : steal their qualifier . 
  `` american '' used to mean `` native american '' before us popular culture spread worldwide . 
  and we cut them from the map because they have problems and we want to distance ourselves from them . 
  if they ( belarus , russia ) did n't have problems the maps would extend to ural as geography dictates and they would truly be at the `` heart of europe '' . 
  further , i 'd like to point out that one of the first things sweden and finland had to fight at eu was about extending the `` maps of europe '' ( not maps of eu ) so that they would include more of our countries than just the capital regions . 
  so this is all very political . 
  if you look at geographic europe , belarus is almost excactly in the centre . 
  usually when we say `` europe '' though we actually mean `` save russia '' . 
  so a bit like washington , d.c. and puerto rico . 
  also the former territories . 
  i cook sitting down on a stool . 
  note that the article was translated to english by somebody with less than perfect command of english . 
  they may have mixed things like `` no grid '' to `` no electricity '' . 
  ( or they lied poorly . ), 
  they may also have an engine-generator , perhaps one that burns wood . 
  would be very useful during winter . 
  i think the general idea of kkk in sweden is the same as in finland : `` the guys at the southern usa who do n't like black people but do like cosplay . '', 
  perhaps something about burning crosses if they 've seen * oh brother , were art thou ? * . 
  keep in mind that we 're talking about area where the confererate flag is used as a well-known symbol for being a self-thinking individual who respects freedom and does n't like needless bureaucracy . 
  i suppose a citizen of us would probably descript the organisation/movement a bit differently . 
  white is more hygienic . 
  and the face mask is just good sense when the stations offer hot dogs etc. 
  being insulted and being offended are not the same . 
  obviously people are offended - the previous brand and design was better than the new one , so should n't you complain when a business you patron gets worse ? 
  the fact that you can also make the always-funny kkk-joke is just cr\u00e8me on the cake . 
  also people have always complained about things that affect their life . 
  why would we be different from our ancestors ? 
   helsinki has been refusing nuclear district heating from loviisa nuclear power plant and prefers to burn coal in the middle of the city ( salmisaari and hanasaari coal-burning power plants ) . 
  they could decide otherwise . 
   afaik , the plan was floated only during the past few years . 
  the loviisa reactors are near their best before-date ( loviisa 1 has 10 years remaining ; loviisa 2 13 ) , so investment in them would not be recuperated . 
  this should have been done in the 1970s or 1980s , well before greens had any real presence in the council . 
  the salmisaari/hanasaari plants are problematic , but they were built just before greens got to power . 
  none the less , hanasaari is n't apparently long in this world and salmisaari is being slowly overhauled to burn wood pellets . 
   besides , petrus pennanen , who was elected , has campaigned for pebble bed reactors . 
  sure , and the finns campaigned on stopping immigration . 
  does n't mean that either can be done on local level . 
  afaik , those pebble bed reactors do n't exist anywhere in the world save few beta-reactors . 
  that 's quite far from pennanen 's `` we 'll just order one or two in a cargo box , pluck the wires in and when it breaks ship out '' - vision . 
  it might be future some day , but it 's still going to be approved through the national level ( that is , when such designs exist on market ) . 
  the thing is , economics and sociology of work tell us that after a certain level of income has been reached , people stop being motivated by money and start being motivated by challenges etc. 
  [ here 's one link on the topic . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/why-incentives-dont-actually-make-people-do-better-work-2014-3?r=us&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t ) education does n't get you just money , it gets you more interesting tasks on a field that you find rewarding . 
  that 's why people study to be teachers , librarians , researchers etc. 
  requiring master 's degree or higher . 
  it does n't get you a lot of money ( heck , sometimes it would have been better to just tend the cash register at the local store ) but you get to set your own tasks , doing the thing you love to do , with a lot of autonomy . 
  i 'm sure that there are people who choose money over interesting tasks , figuring out that they can then party when they 're on vacation : but then you get the challenge that * to spend the money , you ca n't work * . 
  so the incentives are actually counter-intuitive . 
  they motivate you to get home as fast as possible . 
  which might be a good thing if you 're working as a contractor , but usually this is n't the case . 
  all that being said , higher education should be rewarded - - but not necessarily by money . 
  i 'm well aware that some municipalities/counties decided to invest in nuclear power through their energy companies , but they were already buying nuclear power from market to begin with . 
  in the quoted case it was the state which decided to build the reactor , the municipalities/counties just decided to invest on it when nobody else wanted to . 
   highly educated should get better salary . 
  why ? 
  ( this was a question asked for the sake of conversation , not because i want to be anal . ), 
   you do know that the green party was part of the finnish communist party .
