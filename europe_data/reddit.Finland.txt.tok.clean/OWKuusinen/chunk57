  is n't that chinese view based just on popular culture ? 
  i , too , have views on the chinese but you probably should n't listen to me as i know very little of them . 
  he committed crime as a young man . 
  that closed that gate . 
  he 's apparently bipolar and did n't have the right m\u00e9dication . 
  does n't that count for anything . 
  you can find those points all around europe depending what 's included or excluded . 
  i 'm sorry to say , but that whole post seems so very absurd . 
  works well when you steal water from neighbours . 
  the laws have changed a lot during this century , changing the way how money and favours are transferred . 
  this does n't mean that there was n't corruption earlier , it just showed differently . 
  clinton does n't probably even reach top 3 . 
  if you are n't familiar with the illegal settlements , i 'm not going to be the one who 's going to break this for you . 
  my point was that israel is quite fond of lebensraum . 
  arabs have a lot of land they are n't using efficiently . 
  so , double wrong ? 
  you were answering to person who seems to believe that schultz is not of that mind . 
  why do n't you bring that up with the op who seems to believe he did - then you would be asking to prove a positive . 
  are you asking him to prove a negative ? 
  it has been an ongoing topic since 1990s due to immigration and increase of atheism . 
  much has been done but it 's nowhere near finished . 
  also in people 's minds the distinction is nowhere as clear as it 's on paper , so legislation like this garners a lot of heated opinions . 
  keep in mind that until very recently the head of the state and the head of the church were the same person ( and a bit farther back the church administrated counties on behalf of the state ) . 
  with this background , it 's very hard to separate what 's done for religious and what for administrative reasons . 
  marriage exists in sweden / finland because the king needed better data for statistics and taxation records . 
  before that it was just a community ceremony . 
  [ you 're forgetting nokia x ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_x ), 
  that we have somehow forgot to make it illegal in marketing does n't mean we should accept it for democratic process . 
  just because estonians are rich and can afford to buy a potato , does n't mean they can waste it on an energy project such as that . 
  why do you need so many consonants anyway . 
  this just proves that the americans are lazy . 
  they could get to the finals too if they wanted . 
  we switched about ten years ago . 
  i suspect to be more nato-compatible . 
  the translations are different with different audiences in mind . 
  you can find comparisons from the net you have the mind to . 
  do you have a favourite artist/writer-team ? 
  mine was tome and janry ( and franquin as close second ) . 
  franquin died 20 years ago , aged 73 . 
  yeah , franquin ( the writer/artist ) got an environmental awakening later in life , and lagaffe reflects this by getting more interested in the environmt . 
  his `` inventions '' start to be more about being eco-friendly and less about saving money . 
  it works well on the series context , so it is n't surprising that you did n't notice . 
  [ niilo pielinen ] ( https://kauppa.acv.fi/image/cache/catalog/untitled%20folder/181116/dsc_0033-1500x1500.jpg ) in finnish . 
  ( the surname 's origin word is `` pieleen '' , to go wrong '' ), 
   shitty car but that lasts a lifetime . 
  which he abandons in favour of biking when he hears about environmental damage cars cause . 
  he went to doctor for his yearly checkup , the doctor wanted to check his heart , so goscinny got on an exercise bike and while his doctor watched , he got a heart-attack and died . 
  i considered naming lucky luke , but goscinny was not the original writer . 
  while iznogood and asterix were series he created and where he worked more or less freely , lucky luke was something morris created alone and to which goscinny just wrote scripts based on morris ' direction . 
  true , but i was mostly referring to the fact that asterix , iznogood and whatnot have continued on largely on inertia , which stops objectively better comics from rising to the fore . 
  there are two english translations : one for british and simplified for americans . 
   the original author was a pure genious . 
  too bad about that exercise bike . 
  he had so many years of writing ahead of him . 
  after he was buried , all the series he contributed to went downhill . 
  i think it 's fair to say that the french comics scene never recovered . 
   pfft ... 
  the danes have a much bigger `` city '' ( or should we say municipality ? ) . 
  the thing is , we have municipalities in finland as well , but we also have cities . 
  rovaniemi is categorised as a city and not as municipality , though legally there is ( no longer ) any difference . 
  it 's a commun , but rovaniemi is both a city and a commun . 
  there are bigger communs than rovaniemi in finland , too , but no larger cities tahn rovaniemi . 
  part of eu but not of europe . 
  the greatest attraction is probably that they sell themselves internationally as `` the official hometown of santa claus '' and have an amusement park branded [ named to that effect ] ( http://www.santapark.com/en/ ) . 
  for some reason , it gets a lot of brits there every winter-time . 
  as i said above , [ the city is built on alvar aalto 's plan ] ( http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/love/architecture/ ) who also designed many of the public buildings . 
  as such , it 's a pilgrimage destination for architectural students worldwide . 
  ( for finns , the relationship is n't as simple -- aalto 's designs are ubiquitous and have certain repeating problems . 
  however , they are perhaps the biggest - at least , the most visible - symbol of post-ww2 independent finland ) . 
  more recently , [ mr. lordi is from rovaniemi ] ( http://kaaoszine.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lordi-2016.jpg ) and the city has really embraced him as the area 's `` big son '' . 
  the city is an administrative centre for lapland and many governmental offices for the whole country are located there as well , to off-balance taxation money only going to the national capital . 
  largest factories build [ children 's playgrounds ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c19hnkcwqaaslxm.jpg ) and [ puukko-knives ] ( http://www.marttiini.fi/webroot/marttiini/shops/marttiinishop/4c8d/e0d1/6ff4/65fd/389b/0a28/1041/3057/138015-isannnan-ilves.png ) ( also : other knives ) . 
  further , rovaniemi is an university town ( the northest in europe , and perhaps in the world , though i do n't have any proof ) with everything that entitles . 
  according to my literature-oriented friend who moved there to study , it 's an absolutely fantastic place to live if you want to be close to nature for tracking , trekking ( walking , skiing , skating ) and hunting , but does n't really have much of anything else . 
  coincidentally , my friend is slowly sliding into alcoholism . 
  most of the city is designed by [ alvar aalto ] ( http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/love/architecture/ ) , who thanks to the germans did n't have to go through the effort of destroying the existing architecture as he had to in other finnish towns . 
  incidentally , the city is thrice the size of luxembourg due to finland not making a distinction between countryside and urban areas , only between counties , which due to administrative and taxation reasons tend to be rather large , particularly in the north . 
  remember that [ you are only 25 km away from rightful eu soil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_pierre_and_miquelon ) !, 
  why not trade with us ? 
  hey , remember when they thought president schwarzenegger was about as dystopian as it could get ? 
  you 're too young for both . 
  it 's far more energy efficient to grow veggies under the sun at spain and then transporting to finland than growing veggies in -20 c while trying to clean the greenhouse roof from snow every few days . 
  it 's still done , though . 
   these facts are not up for discussion . 
  i am right and you are wrong . 
  i will miss him so badly . 
  dunno , it was interesting information and i think many people appreciated it . 
  you can see that when rome started to withdrew from regions , it 's the red ones that they held the longest and fought to retake when lost . 
  [ compare to this map showing the situation 1000 and 1300 years later ] ( https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/46/64946-004-cb78e6d2.jpg ) . 
  the continent got its name from the province ( or actually , from the area that 's largely contained in the province ) . 
  it 's actually pretty common naming strategy . 
  finland is named after one of its provinces , netherlands is often called holland ( in actuality : just one of the provinces ) , britain is in actuality only a part of the united kingdom , fyromacedonia is named after a province ( most of which lies on the greek side , hence the naming dispute ) etc. 
  edit : africa used to be just the area of the coast south of greece , as marked on the map . 
  well , never heard of the meme . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't understand you . 
  pray tell me , what would have given the colonial era a * good * name ? 
   same with ww2 , germany obviously gets all the critic soviet should get half , after all , they had molotov-rippentrop and invaded poland together . 
  but because soviets and their allies won , naturally germans were the sole bad guys . 
  if the foot would have been in the other shoe , i 'm sure we would be talking how germany got scot-free with the jews .
