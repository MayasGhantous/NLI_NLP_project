this guy has gone through the finnish education system , i 'm pretty sure he 's correct . 
  wow , i 've never seen number 9 before !, 
  love the atmosphere in that painting !, 
  it instantly became one of my favorites . 
  thanks for that link . 
  i 'm dying of laughter here : dd, 
  yes it is !, 
  it was originally written in swedish though because the author tove jansson was a swedish speaking finn . 
  now that i think about it , he has n't actually admitted it ... 
  but it 's still pretty clear tho . 
  of course it is not exactly the same . 
  grrm has admitted that westeros is based on ireland , tho . 
  yeah i was in london for 3 and a half days and i saw pretty much everything there is to see . 
  hell , i even visited hampton court palace , a place many people do n't even know about ( my favorite , btw ) . 
  that 's what 's great about london . 
  my personal experience was that paris is more beautiful ( sorry ) , but london had much more interesting history . 
  as a history lover , i 'd have to say i prefer london . 
  i just love english history for some reason . 
  also , while london is big , it seems that the distances between major attractions were pretty short , and the city feels very cozy . 
  it was a slightly different situation tho , lol . 
  i personally disagree because i do n't think europe needs any more countries ... 
  but i 'm not sure if my reason makes any more sense than yours . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  uk for me , definitely . 
  i have always loved scotland , and that love now extends to the rest of the uk too . 
  if i 'm ever going to move abroad , that 's where i 'm going first . 
  what is this question ? 
  as if ours was n't , lol . 
  that has nothing to do with the city . 
  that 's just a typical finnish attitude towards everything . 
  my favorite :d, 
  whoa !, 
  that video was amazing !, 
  no one said niinist\u00f6 is going to lick putin 's ass . 
  typical finn , talking shit about his own country . 
  that underground helsinki video was very cool . 
  i did n't even know what is going on below me !, 
  that 's a very good picture of the finnish parliament house . 
  looks kinda menacing but at the same time very peaceful with all those flowers around . 
  shit , i just recently visited the place and they told me the reason ... now i 've forgotten . 
  peles castle truly had the most beautiful interior i have ever seen ( exterior is in top 5 too ) . 
  and trust me , i 've seen a lot ( 48 countries visited ) . 
  that looks really cool !, 
  i have n't really seen a design like that before !, 
  honestly the best hamburger i 've ever had ( in a major hamburger restaurant ) . 
  sweden often tries to be ahead of their time in wrong things :d, 
  that 's what my phone background looked like in 2005 . 
  triple-check !, 
  omg , did you see the part with the female presenter and the bearded woman ? 
  shit made me cringe extra hard . 
  that was so swedish . 
  check meatballs ? 
  check moose ? 
  check gay men ? 
  check self-importance ? 
  double-check !, 
  nah , in the south there are n't that much mosquitoes . 
  horrible weather ... well , the winter is too damn long , but the summer here is better than in anywhere else !, 
  helsinki is n't full of forests and wolves . 
  why does it `` barely count '' ?? 
  :d it 100 % counts . 
  although i think that 's in norway  this finnish church was built in 13th century : http://www.kolumbus.fi/kirkko.jossain/kuvat/p7152358_jomala_i.jpg, 
  well yeah ... 
  but nature can be very beautiful without any damn mountains . 
  sadly , / r/earthporn and others are glorifying mountains too much , people are losing the skill to appreciate other things too . 
  i know lol . 
  here in finland , this one place where i spent my childhood was so flat , that the one small hill there was was the biggest mountain ever for us . 
  hahaha :d finns do n't hate talking . 
  let 's just say , that we do n't want to be disturbed when we clearly want to be alone . 
  also , we do n't talk to strangers much . 
  but after we start talking and get to know the person , we like to talk alot and tell everything about everything . 
  also , finns do n't like to speak bullshit . 
  so no unnecessary small-talk , just somewhat meaningful things . 
  yeah many cities in finland have old towns too . 
  in finland they are n't made of stone tho , but wood . 
  for example , [ porvoo old town ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/porvoo_riverside.jpg ) or [ rauma old town ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/kyselyt/ihmeetvanharauma_ky.jpg ) ( unesco world heritage site ) . 
  in many places , all that is left of the really old parts of the city are a [ church ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/turun_tuomiokirkko.jpg ) and [ a castle ] ( http://www.utu.fi/en/studying/other-studies/summer-school/documents/turun%20linna.jpg ) , like in turku ( pictures ) . 
  well , i guess you could consider suomenlinna sea fortress [ the old town of helsinki . 
  ] ( http://www.suomenlinna.fi/files/189/img5434.jpg ) but yeah , viipuri was one of the oldest and biggest cities in finland . 
  it had lots of ancient stuff . 
  it was actually the only city in finland to be surrounded by walls . 
  `` mountains '' ... you sure were drunk !, 
  this was actually a part of our final history exam in finland  we had to interpret what the map meant . 
  i got 5/6 so this question went pretty well . 
  yeah , finland has a bigger army than all other nordic countries combined . 
  the tactic is obviously to survive on their own even without help . 
  swedes use eurovision to invade . 
  he 's a commie scum !, 
  he 's questioning our freedom and superior education system !!!, 
  ` inland !!, 
  i sure as hell do n't pretend !, 
  yeah but my point is that the difference is that to us here in europe , it 's a completely different event if those people die in austria , than if they died in syria . 
  of course , for the people in the truck , it makes no difference . 
  we just simply ca n't have the same attention for every single event that happens around the world . 
  our attention definitely goes to all victims of isis . 
  we just ca n't have massive headlines every day for people who die there . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  do you understand this sentence : `` there 's a difference between my friend dying and some random bloke across the street dying . '', 
  are you telling me there is no difference ? 
  are you telling me i 'm a hypocrite for caring about my friend more ?
