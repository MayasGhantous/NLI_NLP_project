what the hell does that mean ? 
  could someone eli5 how cross eu counter intelligence works and how deep the coop with it is ? 
  the us has the advance of having the tools to create a seemingly effective system but given how eu is still bunch of countries that share some things but not others is ci something that is still mainly done by each country individually ? 
  whoa , that 's a serious accusation . 
  what might be their endgame here ? 
  i view this as nothing but ukraine 's attempt at tarnish russia given their situation . 
  i believe finns do not generally enjoy being the object of jokes . 
  the only subject most finns do not seem to mind is if someone makes fun of us being drunkards . 
  i really dislike that in our culture . 
  funny , 18c is about the warmest climate i still enjoy and feel comfortable in . 
   20c means it 's starting to get so warm you can not do anything without sweating like a pig but those 18c temps are just perfect . 
  but i love that we get these ultimate lows here in the north . 
  it 's very refreshing to be outside ( but you can not stay there for long ) . 
  everything went better than expected . 
  i predict a sudden drop in spaniards after the first really cold winter day in the north . 
  ( right now in finland we have -30 c temps which probably is n't too far from what sweden has as well ),

  this is much more profound with males , [ source ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) . 
  i wonder why . . ? 
  1 , sadly . 
  i do n't believe alcohol had any part in neither . 
  he was a pal from school , got depressed by something . 
  `` good night fellas , see you in ... good morning ! '', 
  google translate , as bad as it is at working with finnish , gave remarkably good translation :  if there is a liquor and tar and tomb  help break down the dark  waning embers , ash darkens  cold to find a home as ground frost  dense ash i might translate that as : `` if booze and tar and tomb does n't help me cut the darkness waning embers , ash darkens cold finds home like frost finds ground `` often '' ( * tuhka tihe\u00e4\u00e4n * is an adverb that is a bolstered version of * often * ), 
  looking at the prices [ they do n't seem to be too expensive ] ( https://m.verkkokauppa.com/fi/catalog/6069c/kirkasvalaisimet-ja--valot ) ( warning : finnish language ), 
  they do sell those and some even buy them ( lol ) but i would n't call them very popular . 
  i have heard people claim that they do work and as a wake up alarm it 's supposed to do wonders . 
  the song is from the early 70 's . 
  we were n't very wealthy back then and irwin represents the hobo/hippie fad that was ravaging the world he was our bob dylan . 
  his nasally voice even sounds a bit like dylan . 
  today sure !, 
  and i think finns are well represented in the canary islands , along with mallorca that 's the summer holiday destination . 
  i was a bit disappointed when they did n't draw finland to play the basketball wc in las palmas a couple of years ago . 
  it 's definitely different . 
  saving money for years to afford a trip to las palmas , day dreaming about the sandy beaches , beautiful ladies and of the sea that stretches as far as they eye can see and once he gets there does n't wan na leave . 
  that 's the basic gist of it . 
  yeah the tourists feel it more strongly . 
  but they also anticipate it and might come just to experience that , we are indifferent about it , but a sunlight once a week could n't do harm . 
  to be honest this actually happens very north . 
  most of finland have only a day or two of constant sun/darkness during the solstice . 
  well no , and you 're right snow actually reflects a lot of light and if moon is visible it is actually relatively bright !, 
  but it 's still darkish and after a day or two it starts to get old . 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/nordkinnhalvoya-polar-night.jpg/800px-nordkinnhalvoya-polar-night.jpg ) is taken midday during the polar night . 
  luckily there is [ las palmas !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/s8gbovjix20 ), 
  yes !, 
  also , you would learn why we are so depressed . 
  constant darkness screws with your head . 
  but the summertime with sun always up is n't as great either . 
  messes up the sleep rhythm when your brain ca n't interpret if it 's late or not . 
  there are parts in finland where sun stays down for months . 
  then again during the summer it 's sunshine 24/7 !, 
  no one drinks more coffee than us so we have that down . 
  would that work in italy ? 
  asking for a friend ... 
   when wom\u00e4n \u00e4t home \u00e4sk \u00f6paut love , finland m\u00e4n not \u00e4nsw\u00f6r . 
  finland m\u00e4n say : tis we olredi talk on th\u00f6 altar . 
  not shou emousshi\u00f6ns . 
  that 's 100 % more than what we have . 
  you have the advantage . 
  the girls here are swept by handsome italianos by their charm . 
  us native guys get the leftovers :(, 
  yes . 
  it is efficient . 
  they ski everywhere and all suffer from asthma . 
  weather is the common one . 
  also , the only one . 
  `` cold today . '', 
  `` yes . '', 
  rolling the car over is the final baptism of all drivers here . 
  they dream of being finland . 
  nothing surprising there , it 's very common . 
  no sweden , you ca n't be finland !, 
  cultural . 
  there 's deep `` you mind your business , i mind mine '' system in place . 
  once you go and talk to a finn we open up more . 
  it 's the initial high courtesy that makes it look like we are anti social . 
  and if it were n't for us , that number would be 324 . 
  so , you 're welcome i guess . 
  in some sports the level would be amazing . 
  mainly team sports . 
  basketball team would challenge the us very well and soccer ? 
  that 's a sure thing gold . 
  i bet all the other companies * consider * that too . 
  does n't mean they 'll do it but it 's an option . 
  nah , the rolling * r * of perkele sets it apart . 
  i remember being very scared of my uncle because i knew that all the dumb shit i did was gon na end up in him yell `` perkele ! '', 
  at me . 
  ( no satan , what did you do ? ), 
  meant i did something that he did n't really like . 
  meant i had fucked something up really really well . 
  i get what you mean , the gothic design can create a powerful atmosphere . 
  but these modern brutal brick churches we have here are not bad at creating that same feel . 
  it 's all down to lightning and how you showcase the place . 
  i 've been to some of these churches . 
  they do a fine job at making a mortal man feel small . 
  but we do like to brag about how we do not like to brag . 
  and we 're the best at that . 
  `` just look how humble we are , much more humble than those guys ! '', 
  or maybe perkele .
