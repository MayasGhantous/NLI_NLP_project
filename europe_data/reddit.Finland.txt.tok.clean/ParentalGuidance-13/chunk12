  did n't watch it much but it seemed to be fairly good quality . 
  95 % shit with all the usual b-grade actors . 
  sometimes there is a surprising exception . 
  a firm handshake and then keeping 1 meter minimum of breathing room is how people are supposed to greet and interact with each other . 
  and no eye contact . 
  the distance or your own feet are two good things to look at . 
  arms either crossed or in pockets . 
  damn , that 's one reality check ... :|, 
  turnips ? 
  is that what you call us ? 
  haha , why ? 
  i think the opposition will do that for you . 
  so you get a hand shaped red marking to one of your cheeks ? 
  what if i fancy her ? 
  can i slip one actual kiss there ? 
  `` oops totally a mistake there , sorry about that '', 
  calamari union , that 's my favorite movie . 
  a gem . 
  nor sure if it translates well to a foreigner . 
  obviously the greatest military leader [ carl gustav emil mannerheim ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) he led the victorious whites in the civil war ( controversial as the opposing reds were not treated well , whites massacred many of them ) . 
  he also led finland during ww2 and managed to stop the soviet union from occupying and claiming finland as one of their satellite states . 
  he was the clear winner of a public poll about who is the greatest finn . 
  other very good alternatives are the national composer [ jean sibelius ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_sibelius ) who can be considered one of the all-time best composers of the world , the national author [ aleksis kivi ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksis_kivi ) who wrote `` seven brothers '' which is seen one of the earliest finnish language novels and was very much unlike the usual idyllic image novels of that time period tried to paint about finland and the finns . 
  third good one is and paediatrician [ arvo ylpp\u00f6 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/arvo_ylpp\u00f6 ) who is responsible for significantly decreasing the child-mortality rate during the 20th century . 
  he himself lived to be 104yo so he was a living testament for good health and long age . 
  all i know is johan b\u00e4ckman is n't among the most loved ones . 
  he is the face for russian propaganda and pro-russian ideas . 
  he goes on russian tv-shows and lies about finland and the finnish attitudes about anything russia-related . 
  we see thru his lies and dumb thoughts but unfortunately his thoughts are probably getting thru much better in russia . 
  it 's estimated that he is 5 times as visible in russia as any actual finnish politician so what he says will be pretty much seen as the finnish pov . 
  he is a very dangerous man . 
  that 's alright . 
  we feel sorry for you as well . 
  * nojatuoli * means armchair in finnish , and at least * nojatuoli-kenraali * ( armchair general ) is a used term . 
  sweden is nice . 
  the way of living matches ours really well . 
  but then again there really is n't a bad country in eu , all of them have nice people and beautiful places to visit . 
  these days they got that mobile or nfc payment . 
  really simple !, 
  it 's cute . 
  almost never happens though . 
  sure there will be plenty of plants that do not need or can invest in robotics and that do not care about lead times or transportation costs . 
  but there * is * a whole heap of ones that do , and as the automation keeps lowering the overall cost of making stuff the transportation time and costs are becoming more and more crucial factors in overall value . 
  i think as india and china have been invaded with factories we are starting to look towards africa . 
  many of the countries there are not safe for businesses but some are , and that will be the next continent to get the `` factory hug . '', 
  that has been done already . 
  in fact some companies are bringing their factories back . 
  automation , the cost of transportation and lead time are the main reasons . 
  only the labour-heaviest stuff is staying there . 
  to get people to buy european/american instead of the ones coming elsewhere . 
  it 's not that they emit more pollution , the standards are different and they are one way to limit the import of foreign vehicles . 
  getting an american spec car here is just as hard if not harder . 
  excluding the final chapter about final provisions , the last , 12th chapter in it 's entirety goes :  ** chapter 12 - national defence **, 
  but is n't harmony very lovely sounding though ? 
  we would n't wan na destroy something like that , would we ? 
  ha , we 'll start overtaking estonia once we get the hang of your language . 
  yep , thanks for the additions !, 
  quenya sounds very much like finnish , but only the words mean nothing in finnish . 
  there are the rolling r 's , double vowels and consonants and the words and sentences itself have a structure like some gibberish finnish . 
  i think all the major dialects are easily understandable but there are certain stereotypes for people that use them . 
  the most famous ones being about [ savonian dialects ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/savonian_dialects ) and how those people are a bit goofy . 
  helsinki has it 's [ own old slang ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_slang ) that is a cross between russian , swedish , german and today english with finnish grammar . 
  sounds like finnish yet most words wont make any sense for the uninitiated . 
  the slang is not very widely used but you can sometimes hear it being used when visiting the capital . 
  not turku . 
  yeah . 
  this was i believe in 2005 or 2006 , but it left a clear memory . 
  i read and our 8th grade class went to see a theatre version of * l'avare * and * le malade imaginaire * ( a `` joint '' adaptation ) . 
  i loved it !, 
  well , [ kinda . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_kalevala_translations ) as the epic is somewhat famous not to mention old there are 5 full english translations of it . 
  and , for any other lovely people that would like to read it in their language , that wikipedia-page should help you find one in your language as well !, 
  i have n't personally read it in english at all so i ca n't comment on how good they are and even in finnish i have read it only here and there . 
  what you should know is that the poems in kalevala are very distinctively finnish and any translations are only going to be almost there but not quite , if that . 
  but , i suggest you try to get your hands on the william forsell kirby 's translation as it , according to that wikipedia page , mimics the kalevala meter . 
  edit : what i am kinda sad about is how little willingness there has been in making film adaptations . 
  sure , the meter might make it hard to turn it into a movie and the story is not as straight forward story as what we have grown accustomed to with modern movies but with some clever writing there could be a movie in there . 
  [ johan ludvig runeberg ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_ludvig_runeberg ) and [ elias l\u00f6nnrot ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/elias_l\u00f6nnrot ) . 
  the first one is considered our national poet and his stories about f\u00e4nrik st\u00e5hl ( the tales of ensign st\u00e5hl ) are largely considered pieces that gave finns some of their moral identity . 
  f\u00e4nrik st\u00e5hl 's stories contain `` our land '' poem that is now more commonly used and known as our de facto national anthem . 
  l\u00f6nnrot is known for collecting old folk tales and compiling them into an epic known as [ kalevala ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevala ) , which was later named as our national epic . 
  tolkien used kalevala as one of his biggest inspirations for all of his books , and some languages he made for his stories have their base in finnish . 
  only slightly masochistic . 
  you know the dead hardened skin that builds up in your soles ? 
  we call that `` cheese '' . 
  het buddy what hap, 
  [ it 's not secure ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4dpulp/telegram_vs_whatsapp_semi_rant_after_being/ ) , even though that 's the one thing they claim they are and the sole thing they market with . 
  i do n't trust whatsapp one bit but i do trust it more than i trust telegram . 
  telegram uses their very own encryption which itself is an alarming idea , and their servers are stationed in multiple different places that they will not disclose . 
  the founder of telegram is a russian called pavel durov . 
  he 's the man behind vk , which is a russian version ( copy ) of facebook . 
  he claimed the site was taken over by the russian government . 
  now i have no particular reason to believe a random russian person or be vary of what he says or has done but if one of his services was allegedly taken over by putin it does n't really make telegram look good . 
  if they took over vk , they might very well take over telegram as well . 
  in a way am terrified of whatsapp and facebook because of security . 
  but , for a company what has been able to turn that into money any possible scandals about some nutty security privacy thing would kill them so they are not as likely to do any too crazy , just the average privacy infringement . 
  telegram on the other hand is a small random group that might do anything with all the into they gather because they very likely have n't been able to make any real money with this , and that scares me more . 
  i would love if people would switch to signal . 
  that is supposedly the least unsecure one . 
  i do n't really trust the guys behind telegram .
