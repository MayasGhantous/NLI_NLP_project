  i trust facebook less , but unfortunately all my friends are using whatsapp so i must do so as well . 
  even when you exclude the fact that captain slowly was in finland this is one of my favorite episodes . 
  h\u00e4kkinen is a hilarious fella and the whole segment on folkrace was amazing . 
  alright , french then . 
  from my three travels to france i 'd say they do n't really use english that much . 
  i 'm almost positive they understand it but they just do n't use it !, 
  i ca n't believe a guy on the desk at disneyland mcdonald 's does n't know one word of english . 
  in finland , hmmm ... 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/2bmqdnx5r1u?t=5m56s ) our track gauge is about the same as it 's in russia because that historically enabled us to do loads of business with them ( logistics ) . 
  so , our trains use a wider gauge than in europe which obviously rules out any of this . 
  `` luckily '' we are so isolated from the main parts of europe we could n't really make a track to there anyway . 
  and who wants to go to [ sweden ? 
  surstr\u00f6mming . 
  ... just kidding no one likes that . 
  pizza and kebab !, 
  any from the germanic language family will be the easiest . 
  so german or scandinavian languages . 
  domestic trips by either car or a train depending on the destination and where we are staying . 
  international by plane because finland is isolated from the rest of the europe by the baltic sea . 
  we used to take a ferry to sweden but that 's more of a young man 's game , i rather get to the destination asap and then enjoy it . 
  ferries are a drag . 
  or maybe all the buildings are special !, 
  so why exactly they still continue produce such a shoddy devices ? 
  my philips tv is maybe the worst ever . 
  and with the amounts of traffic we have ( virtually none , excluding helsinki metro area ) there really is no use for the multi-laned roudabouts . 
  but swedes , please learn to signal * outside * the roundabout when you exit . 
  a neonazi kicked a man in the chest during their rallies , the victim later died . 
  we had a huge 15k strong demonstration last saturday linking to this , and there are talks about banning far-right/left movements and giving the police better ways to tackle these types of things . 
  some have seen this demo and the talks as a way to take `` a small thing '' and using it to push thru their ( ? ), 
  agendas . 
  the demo was advertised as one `` against assaults and racism '' . 
  that 's awesome . 
  and makes perfect sense . 
  but compared to north america and europe , asian connections with france and britain and australian connections to britain , i think south america has the least . 
  i may be way off as well , maybe spain does have loads of current affairs with some latin american countries . 
  the biggest driver for deep relations is industries , south america perhaps is n't as advanced there compared to those mentioned . 
  gim me a box of m\u00e4mmi with cream and i 'm there . 
  or karelian pies . 
  or dried reindeer meat . 
  yup , same for finland, 
  south america is about as far from here as possible . 
  imo they have the least connections to europe . 
  so yeah , we do n't think about them too much . 
  only during the world cup . 
  argentina and riquelme used to be * my team * !, 
  some profanities have become like syntactic expletives , people use vittu ( ~ cunt ) so widely i sometimes forget the meaning , it 's almost like meaningless profanity . 
  finns swear a ton , but after serving my compulsary army stint i learned not to swear as much and i have tried to maintain that . 
  after all , the swears coming from a man that uses them a lot are not as powerful than from a man that swears seldom . 
  nature . 
  [ we got lakes yo . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_lakes_of_finland ), 
  multiple people waiting at the same stop ? 
  ridiculous idea . 
  if you see another already waiting at the stop you either go back gome , walk to the one after that or wait until the bus took that other person away . 
  `` h\u00f6lkyn k\u00f6lkyn '' probably comes from the german soldiers stationed in finland during the ww2 and their idiom `` zur h\u00f6lle durch k\u00f6ln ! '', 
  which rougly translates to `` to hell by cologne '' . 
  no idea how that should be understood , probably a warcry of sorts . 
  get out of here !, 
  [ sandels ] ( http://www.esaimaa.fi/f/0/06/big_19189864.jpg ) is clearly the best , no contest . 
  aki kaurism\u00e4ki has done multiple great ones , but my favorite is [ calamari union ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0087020/ ) . 
  his work is best enjoyed when you understand the language and the quirks in it he likes to use but even with english subtitles it 's great . 
  kaurism\u00e4ki himself is a big nutcase but he does make great movies . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7914479/monarchy-attracts-500-million-a-year-from-overseas-tourists.html i 'm fairly sure . 
  yes , most of the things they visit are old but in 200 years they will have some new tourist attraction about queen elisabeth . 
  kudos to / u/aameba, 
  monarchs bring loads of turism , and i kinda like how for instance sweden has such a long heritage in monarchs , and how they still are open to make the house more modern and open . 
  i 'm glad we did n't end up having a monarch ( though it was close during the independence and at the time the more favourable system ) but i 'm still a bit jealous of the swedish history . 
  `` per se '' -  perse means ass in finnish some drink cartridges have swedish instructions to shake ( = omskakas ) before opening . 
  * `` kakka '' * is poo is finnish and can be informally declined to * `` kakas '' * , * `` omassa '' * = in your own , could be written informally as * `` omas '' * . 
  tl ; dr : swedes are instructed to stir the drinks in their own poo . 
  this was hilarious to the 5yo me just starting to learn how to read . 
  yeah , apart from the obvious pickpockets . 
  and even then there are places that are not as prone to that , stockholm , copenhagen , oslo and helsinki probably are on the lower side on that . 
  kinda tough to reach on a cruise boat too so if you manage to do that you 're just asking for trouble . 
  i wonder where sister sue ellen is . . ? 
  you are in a very central position in europe and the labour is relatively cheap . 
  you also as a big country likely have loads of factories . 
  using just the last name sounds odd . 
  i think actually sounds a bit insulting . 
  if you want to be polite and correct use both first and last name but no one should mind if you use just the first name . 
  then comes the boring tidbit stuff : finnish has a general ( old ) formal way to address people : `` teitittely '' comes from using the personal pronoun `` te '' as opposed to `` sin\u00e4 '' , both meaning `` you '' but the first one is more formal . 
  someone might show respect to someone by asking first if they can divert to informal speech . 
  this is called `` sinunkauppa '' = `` you trade/transaction '' . 
  `` te '' also means `` you '' as plural , even in informal talks so by using `` te '' about a single person you kinda discuss as if there were multiple persons . 
  here is a good wikipedia article about this and it 's usage in different countries / u/mynameisadictator might wan na go thru : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/t\u2013v_distinction people today talk very informally , even to say a president . 
   people declare bankruptcy because they can not afford their treatment . 
  what does this have to do with me ? 
  i am able to afford good insurance . 
  the same argument can be applied to health insurance companies . 
  this is where we see things differently . 
  i want the fella next to me to also afford to get treatment . 
  i see that as one of the best ways to use my tax money . 
  if they can treat him and get him to be a good contributor for our society it 's absolutely worth it . 
  and if shit hits the fan and i need treatment . 
  i know he thinks like that as well for me . 
   while the state can continuously extract money with minimal risk ( taxation ) , the health insurance companies wants ... no needs healthy customers to keep paying their premiums . 
  all i 'm getting from that is that they need the healthy ones . 
  how about the sick and people that need treatment ? 
  i come back to my last question of what 's the goal , to get people healthy or to collect insurance payments ? 
  yet your people still declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses and most of your elderly are uninsured .
