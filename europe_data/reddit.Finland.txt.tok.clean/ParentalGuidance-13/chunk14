  and the fact of the matter is that we do n't trust insurance companies with our medical treatment . 
  they are there to gain money from dealing with you , their goal is n't to make you healthy but make more money . 
  if they can help it , they will pay less for your treatment . 
  state wants , no ... 
  needs to get you healthy because healthy population is better than ill one . 
  and is n't that the result you should aim at ? 
  treating people , no making money from their illnesses ? 
  finnish castles . 
  i 'm not sure how well known they are but [ we have multiple very well restored old castles ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=list_of_castles_and_fortresses_in_finland&amp;mobileaction=toggle_view_mobile ) , many dating back to the 13th century . 
  few great ones to mention are turku castle in turku , h\u00e4me castle in h\u00e4meenlinna , olaf 's castle in savonlinna and suomenlinna in helsinki . 
  the last one was more of a fortress and is new compared to the rest but it 's still great to experience . 
  i have to also mention kalle p\u00e4\u00e4talo . 
  his iijoki series is very good but also long as hell . 
  i 've read only the first two but they were excellent . 
  another fine one is veijo meri . 
  `` manillak\u00f6ysi '' is a ridiculously great book , bit of a forgotten gem in our literature history . 
   furious if either i or the other is late see that 's why i 'm not completely german . 
  i am very annoyed if someone is late except if it 's me since i obviously have a perfectly fine reason to be late . 
  ridiculous tidiness and systematicness , everyone is an engineer . 
  every third sentence has either achtung or halt . 
  strangers ? 
  we do n't interract with anyone familiar either . 
  the best discussion is the one that did n't happen . 
  and if you must say something one syllable has to suffice . 
  just think of austin powers : `` yeah baby !, 
  i do n't kiss and tell i shag and brag '' ... 
  so you change a nation full of people that you ca n't understand for nation full of people that you ca n't understand . 
  i like a healthy bit of rivalry but a fair one . 
  i do n't want to see eu purposefully try to stop us goods coming to here or vice versa . 
  but sparring each other helps to improve our world . 
  yeah wealth is highly dependable . 
  you can perhaps get better pay ( or roughly the same ) and pay less for some things but you also do n't have universal healthcare and other benefits our states provide . 
  so lose one get one type of a situation . 
  we have the most absurd world championship events . 
  events like [ wife-carrying ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/wife-carrying ) , [ mobile phone throwing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mobile_phone_throwing ) , [ former sauna championships ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_sauna_championships ) , [ air guitar playing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_guitar ) , [ swamp football ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swamp_football ) , mosquito swatting , ant nest sitting and [ many more ] ( http://www.thecrowdedplanet.com/10-weird-finnish-events/ ) . 
  i think we can all agree that finland is by and large the weirdo of the european family . 
  no , finns are finns , spaniards are spaniards . 
  we are european because we are in europe . 
  but , we also have a different background as opposed to other europeans . 
  bananas , blueberries , citrus fruits , quark . 
  throw everything in the blender and enjoy that healthy purple delicious goodness . 
  how about french . 
  a whole bunch of them know english but just wo n't use it . 
  dammit , i 'm looking at you guy from disneyland mcdonalds !, 
  there 's zero chance you got that position without knowing what i mean when i ask for a paper bag . 
  and that was n't the only instance i noticed . 
  sounds like you speak from personal experience . 
  and janne has visited a whole bunch of them as well , he keeps leaving `` janne was here '' everywhere . 
  it lasted for less than two months so not really . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_ ( 1918 ), 
  yes your highness . 
  * kneel *, 
  first of all , not your boy . 
  second , you seriously , seriously underestimate how much we have done with norway during the last century , like the shared open borders and open job market . 
  it 's nearing to disrespectful attitude really . 
  and seriously mister tell me where , when and who stated that finland is a baltic state . 
  it 's a small group than enjoy those cruises , 9/10 finns do not visit estonia ever . 
  the basic gist of that tradition is that those witches knock on your door , sing a common short poem about how if you give `` pay '' ( = treats ) they will give you that decorated branch as a good luck for the rest of the year . 
  if you do not they will cast a spell . 
  nobody has been brave enough to see what happens if you do n't pay [ them . 
  ] ( http://www.santahamina.fi/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pikkunoidat_2012-2012-04-01-09-28-54.jpg ) undoubtedly terrible things !, 
  we have been under the same rule with norway as well . 
  but sure , most of the finns do live closer to estonia than norway and more likely have visited estonia as opposed norway . 
  but , the thing with the estonian cruises is that certain population likes to do that on the regular , most do not . 
  i have n't been to estonia , i have been in norway multiple times and loads of people close to me have as well . 
  when we are talking about countries so close to one another the fact that estonia is closer to some bunch dulls out into irrelevance . 
  we had more norwegian volunteers during ww2 since we in all honesty were at war against you . 
  shared anthem means nothing . 
  the fact that there are loads of estonians here mean that * they * share stuff with estonia , not finns . 
  the last one is absolutely false and if someone has labeled finland as a baltic state they have been off the rails big time . 
  there 's around 30 thousand ethnic finns living in norway , and that history goes into the 16th century . 
  sure . 
  that discussion you linked had us being something different from both the europeans and asians , and yeah the popular volga upstream theory should whither and die . 
  but we ca n't claim to be part of the same genetic family as most european , the haplogroups i linked show that certain large part of the finnish population do have ancestry in asia . 
  that link is from tens of thousands of years ago but it is there . 
  i just told you the stuff we share with norway . 
  please , outside of a language from the same language family what are the factors that we share with estonia that we do n't with norway ? 
  do tell what these facts are . 
  edit : [ go freshen up on your history ] ( https://et.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kveenid ), 
  this is really a ridiculous argument we 're having here . 
  it 's like you are some mistress wanting us to say that we love you more than we do the other ladies we have been with for a much longer period . 
  there 's plenty of finland for all of you :3 i 'm telling you , we share more with norway than with estonia . 
  not by much since we share a lot with you as well , but if i had to choose ... 
  with norway , absolutely . 
  denmark might be up for debate . 
  we are as a whole as close to friends you can be without actually being one nation . 
  for instance , we have had open borders and open shared job markets with each other since the early 50 's . 
  my father was able to go to work in sweden during the early 80 's without having to apply for a work visa . 
  he could have done so with any other nordic country as well . 
  that was unheard of in the rest of the world . 
  culturally , historically and politically we share very similar systems , a high tax level and relatively large public sector . 
  so while we have deep and great relations with estonia and we keep improving them and we have loads to learn from you guys the connection we share with the nordic nations is more evolved because of history and similar povs of this world . 
  it 's a moot point really trying to put close friends into order , choosing your favourite among all the great neighbors we have is nearly impossible . 
  but if i had to look for friends in need the nordic countries are the ones we naturally look for . 
  and i believe this connection is mutual with them towards us as well . 
  i think you underestimate how deep the relations among the nordics are . 
  we have hundreds of years of history between each other , heck we used to be one big nation a few hundred years ago . 
  it 's a friendly banter among the nordics . 
  they make dumb jokes about us as well . 
  we say [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/pw3e64soseg ) , they reply with [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/nal9oygyxog ) .
