  swedish speaking areas are on the western south-west and south areas , and there are towns where there 's almost a 100 % swedish speaking population and the town next to them might have only finnish speaking population . 
  there is no gradual change . 
  makes you look bigger and lets be honest , shopping from the children 's section is a bit strange . 
  i know some people that claim their apparent big structure by shopping only large or bigger clothing . 
  yeah , we would have had our own mythology with loads of gods . 
  most of these people are a bit of tools , some just tag along thinking these nutjobs are somehow fighting for righteousness . 
  our country with it 's relatively homogeneous population might be the reason for this . 
  we just do n't have experience with people with vastly different backgrounds . 
  * turku-natives are the only foreigners we see in these parts of the woods * ( joke ) . 
  the deepest , most loud , most racist nationalist populistic lunatics . 
  you can comment on the current policies regarding asylum seekers , you can be against them if you wish . 
  but these nutcases group up , [ wear black hooded clothing ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/5637768/landscape16_9/1024/576/5009889499a6b4f8a8e8d567568bc468/ug/31407624.jpg ) and [ patrol in a tight bunch in various city centers ] ( https://imgur.com/a/kx2tq ) , claiming that them being there is making the area safer . 
  as if ... edit : meanwhile , a whole bunch of the leaders of this movement have criminal records such as battery against foreigners and battery against women . 
  these guys are looking for a chance to assault someone and the asylum seekers are the prime target . 
  this obviously works only if you are a member of an unemployment fund while you had the job and qualify to receive their payments ( have worked long enough while being a member ) . 
  there are independent unemployment funds but most people are part of one thru labor unions . 
  the state would give you the bare minimum if you do n't have a job , the fund will for a short period give you more than that . 
  yeah , all they can reach is sweden , tops . 
  * united in diversity * . 
  how could anything be better than that ? 
  no no , when i think of a swede swearing it has to be `` fy fan '' . 
  do n't forget `` fy fan '' , the least powerful profanity there is . 
  one more step towards perfect finnish !, 
  ass, 
  good . 
  good . 
  perkele indeed , that 's my favorite one though i do n't use it a lot . 
  perse is the primary weapon of choise for me . 
  learn the profanities and you 're halfway there . 
  i 'd like for everyone to just respect others and get along with each other . 
  that includes europeans and those that are not european . 
  and i wish people saw others mainly as individuals , not as part of some group that defines them completely . 
  harsh times are the perfect cooking chamber for nationalist populistic ideologies , peope are easily wooed by those and they do n't need to deliver anything other than complain about everything that can be used to their advantage . 
  loads of talk , very little good deeds . 
  home identity is important to define a person but everyone should also see and respect others and their identities , and collaborate with one another . 
  that way we can become better as nations , as europeans and non-europeans and as individuals . 
  good times !, 
  correct answer : frankfurt, 
  that 's exactly it . 
  / u/stalemeat mentioned sami-people and how they were treated and that might be the only thing . 
  yeah . 
  and the swedish army had lot of finnish soldiers . 
  we just call you `` tsekki '' or `` tsekit '' ( plural for some reason ) . 
  i get why you would change it . 
  [ mrw reading this comment ] ( https://i.imgur.com/moovpfa.jpg ), 
  you know , i really am not ashamed of any historical stuff finland has done . 
  or at least ca n't think of any particular thing . 
  wwii was a necessary `` evil '' in order to stay as a sovereign nation and not become a soviet state . 
  the civil war was a taboo for until all the people that took part in it had died , so even if it might be seen as the darkest timeline in our history there are good points with both sides . 
  someone might figure out a good one to be ashamed of but i ca n't think one . 
  not trying to be `` that dude '' , i just ca n't think of one i should be ashamed of . 
  if you veer off the biggest touristy places the northern europe has plenty of `` relaxed '' service personnel . 
  a question like that can only be answered by a video : https://youtu.be/wkyd-cdd_gs, 
  yeah it 's gon na take a while before i get used to that name . 
  offtopic : do you like it ? 
  how 's the general feeling about that ? 
  meat testacles ? 
  that ca n't be right ... 
  healthcare being one of the biggest factors here . 
  american pays huge amounts for stuff we can `` get cheaper '' due to healthcare being state funded . 
  yep . 
  it was a necessary step to ensure safety against ussr . 
  we had been close to germany before the war and many of our high ranking officers had served in the german empire 's army during the wwi , so that alliance came very naturally . 
  the first battle ( winter war ) between the ussr and finland was fought entirely by those two nations . 
  germany took part in the second conflict , continuation war . 
  we consider us as the main opponent of russia on that conflict as well . 
  those wars , though lost , are seen as victories against an overwhelming enemy . 
  holocaust i believe is taught just like it is taught in every other western country . 
  just because we were allies of germany does n't mean we took part in that . 
  same goes with hitler . 
  hitler visited finland once , and an [ unofficial taping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hitler_and_mannerheim_recording ) of the meeting between mannerheim ( our president and commander-in-chief ) and hitler was recorded which is believed to be the only recording where hitler is speaking with his regular tone . 
  is n't that a bit embarrassing to sweden as well ? 
  a rogue sub got very deep into your territorial waters and only 10km away from one of the navy bases . 
  or were the fishermen part of your coastal guard ? 
  / s  very interesting incident . 
  finland got it 's independence from russia in 1917 in the middle of russia 's revolution . 
  initially it was decided that the new found state should become [ a monarch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_\\ ( 1918 \\ ) ) , and a german prince [ frederick charles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_frederick_charles_of_hesse ) was chosen as the king . 
  germany was seen as a great potential partner in the fear of russia and selecting a german prince was thought to deepen the relationships of finland and the german empire . 
  germany wanted to establish better role in the east and finland thanks to the location served as a good potential ally for potential war against russia . 
  when germany lost the wwi this connection was seen troublesome and the prince wisely renounced the throne . 
  1919 the state regent mannerheim ( later served as the command-in-chief during wwii and the sixth president ) ruled finland 's form of government as a republic . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/king_of_finland%27s_crown.jpg ) is the copy of the crown designed for the new king . 
  the original was never made , but this version was later made on the old schemes . 
  on top is the finnish lion , each county 's coat of arms are on the side . 
  i love these types of things . 
  absolutely brilliant . 
  in the old you had to tape certain parts of the headlights if you had a right-side driven car and went to uk to drive in the ~ ~ wrong ~ ~ ^ ^ ^ cough !, 
  left-side traffic . 
  not sure how that works with modern xenon/led lights ... 
  russians did not fair particularly well during the ww2 . 
  [ against finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) they had almost 1 million troops , against 300k finns . 
  they ended up with  300k casualties , finns around 70k . 
  they were superior in almost every possible measure . 
  i skimmed thru that webstore , and found a nice [ salmiakki bundle ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/product_info.php?cpath=232&amp;products_id=2763 ) with a good variety of the most popular salmiakki products . 
  in addition of those , [ fazer blue chocolate ( fazerin sininen ) ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/index.php?cpath=24_38_191_418 ) is a must order if you get these . 
  top tier chocolate . 
  there are different flavours but the basic one is the real deal . 
  if you have kids of your own or someone else close to you has some , moomin products are fun and a bit exotic gifts . 
  and [ arabia-made moomin porcelain mugs ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/index.php?cpath=56_167&amp;sort=2a&amp;page=2 ) are often pretty sought-after , people collect them and some can reach values north of 200 $ . 
  hope you find good stuff there !,
