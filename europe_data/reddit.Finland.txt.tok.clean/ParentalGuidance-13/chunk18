  :p ' suddenly hungry . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/index.php?cpath=24_36 ) webstore ships all kinds of finnish stuff abroad . 
  tyrkisk peber bags are a bit more advanced , tread carefully with those . 
  sisu is another popular one , clears your throat nicely , sisu horna ( `` inferno '' ) is the spiciest of them , i have a bag on me at all times . 
  salmiakki is stuff that takes an acquired taste . 
  i hated it as a kid , but after a while i started to `` get '' the fuss and now i love it . 
  guys guys guys ... 
  get your heads straight . 
  hey you got plenty to be proud of that we do n't have !, 
  cleanliness and social security . 
  cheap education , high living standards , nature . 
  and not a lot of wild animals that are actively trying to kill you . 
  sauna culture . 
  freedom and safety . 
  oulu , but i was born in helsinki . 
  even after being in oulu for +15 years some people asked where i was from because i did n't speak the part . 
  you make a fair point . 
  i have heard i do n't really carry any particular dialect in my speech . 
  i 've lived in a city that has very clear distinct dialect for almost 20 years ( pre-teens to young adult ) but somehow it never really rubbed on me . 
  that 's gon na have serious immediate affects on european-american relationships , and not any positive ones . 
  yep . 
  they adore strong leader because that 's what they 're used to . 
  they do n't understand how * they * could have some say in how the country is ran . 
  but as it stands dropping democracy bomb on them might not work well . 
  estonia took years to get to this point , and that 's a fairly small nation . 
  i think they still suffer from some old relics from the ussr era . 
  maybe some estonian could give their insight on that . 
   saw a golden cross on the blue sky as he landed in finland i can [ picture ] ( http://i.giphy.com/vem7vdkdaciyg.gif ) how lovely that cross must have been . 
  in the nordic nations dannebrog is obviously the one every other flag copies so i guess your backstory is . . our backstory as well ? 
  and i kinda like that , creates nice unity here . 
  [ the finnish blue cross flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/flag_of_finland_%281918-1920%29.svg/200px-flag_of_finland_%281918-1920%29.svg.png ) was first used in the mid 19th century ( so before finland was independent ) by some yacht clubs . 
  the dimensions differed a bit but the basic idea was the same : blue cross against a white background . 
  other color schemes were also proposed during the late 19th century , red and yellow scheme as a one notable alternative . 
  but , russia did n't grant finland the right to use it 's own merchant flag so we then had to stick with the russian tricolored one . 
  the blue crossed flag and other alternatives were seen as tokens of resistance and liberty movements and thus illegal . 
  some alternative designs surfaced during the last years before the independence ( 1917 ) . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/striped_flag_of_finland_%28unofficial%29.svg/200px-striped_flag_of_finland_%28unofficial%29.svg.png ) and [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/blue-white_striped_flag_of_finland_%28unofficial%29.svg/200px-blue-white_striped_flag_of_finland_%28unofficial%29.svg.png ) for instance . 
  once the independence was gained the first initial flag was a simple flag with white and blue vertical bars , one each . 
  at the start of 1918 the senate ruled [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/flag_of_finland_1918_%28merchant%29.svg/200px-flag_of_finland_1918_%28merchant%29.svg.png ) as the temporary merchant flag and [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/flag_of_finland_1918_%28state%29.svg/500px-flag_of_finland_1918_%28state%29.svg.png ) served as the national flag until may 1918 . 
  our civil war ( ending on may 15th 1918 ) was fought between what were commonly known as * `` whites '' * and * `` reds '' * , `` reds '' being proletarianistic side and `` whites '' the right-wing people . 
  as the `` whites '' won the war , having red color in the flag was seen as a bad idea so the original [ blue cross flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/flag_of_finland_%281918-1920%29.svg/200px-flag_of_finland_%281918-1920%29.svg.png ) was chosen . 
  so someone who got their nationality last spring should in your view be allowed to run for the president ? 
  in some distant future this will become outdated but seeing how the world stands right now it 's good to have some stability like this . 
  presidency is very much a seremonial job here these days , they should represent the majority of the people and guide them towards a smart common goal . 
  yes , there can be exceptions to every rule . 
  but the likelihood that they feel more passionate about our country is higher when they have been there their entire lives . 
  in the job , sure . 
  they can be just as good . 
  but the original purpose of that was to not let power slip to another nation ( somewhere directly from east i would presume ) . 
  i think when they have stronger ties to finland they will likely feel more passionate about our country 's affairs and it 's interests . 
  but as i said , mp 's are the ones with real power , government and prime minister being the ones in control of the day-to-day politics . 
  nationalized people can get into the parliament , and i think we should have more of those people there ( not sure if there is any really or if there ever has been ) . 
  [ guys , see what i mean . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uirmmop.gif ) there are some really odd fellas in / r/suomi but do n't pay attention , they will lose interest soon . 
  dinner . 
  edit : i need to eat every 3-4 hours , so if i eat at 6:30 am , lunch will have to happen before 11am , small snack in work and dinner at 4-5pm . 
  supper is at 8pm at my house . 
  i think finns mostly use this type of schedule with their eating . 
  but the actual case i made , and the time i eat has nothing to do with it , was that closing in the middle of the day seems odd . 
  what if someone wants to go to a restaurant at 5pm ? 
  cheese first , ham on top insist otherwise and and the gloves will drop the beauty of ham is such a delight those that think different , your head is not right, 
  yes . 
  the finnish president is also very much a seremonial task , he/she has some actual political responsibilities but all the real stuff is done by the government . 
  one place where the president is highly influential is foreign relationships . 
  but prime minister is the one doing the heavy lifting and being responsible for the daily political stuff . 
  the power they have is mainly in taking part in public debate . 
  i do n't think any european monarch has actual political de jure power . 
  [ `` after-oven rye bread '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/j%c3%a4lkiuunileip%c3%a4 ) , smear some butter or other spread goodness , slap emmental cheese on that bad boy , finish with a nice cut of smoked ham and perhaps some tiny bit of cucumber or other veggies . 
  ** i ca n't stress enough the importance of putting the cheese first and then ham second on top of that . 
  midsummer 's eve , i recommend it to every foreigner who thinks about visiting finland . 
  or the polar opposite , winter solstice . 
  nature is the big seller in finland , santa claus in rovaniemi or our capital . 
  rented cottages are very common as well . 
  it makes . 
  yeah we do n't have that . 
  8 hours is the usual working time but you can stay longer , you also likely will get overtime bonus because of it if you contract states so . 
  i think shifts are common in medim to large places , but if it 's a small family owned joint they will likely work longer hours . 
  owning a restaurant in finland is not the best way to make money , these people usually get enough to get by and even the fine dining places are often financially iffy . 
  welcome to finland then , the land of 11am-23pm / 4am restaurant hours . 
  we have restaurants open at those hours . . we do n't have downtime in the middle of day . 
  this is not a wrong thing to do , it 's just strange to me . 
  to be fair going for dinner at a restaurant is n't very common here . 
  people rather make their own food . 
  we do have caf\u00e9s and small places like that . 
  it 's just weird how a restaurant closes up in the middle of what to me seems like the prime moment to serve food . 
  it 's a cultural thing , and my one week stay in bilbao was not ruined by this . 
  lovely place . 
  yes absolutely . 
  but you can go have a dinner at that time too . 
  many restaurants are open in helsinki at those hours as well . 
  there is no downtime in the middle of the day . 
  snacks are what is eaten between meals . 
  the true point here is that there are people with multiple different timetables , someone wants to eat at 3pm , someone at 5pm and someone at 8pm . 
  in spain only the last one gets to eat . 
  yeah i figured something like that . 
  :d we have people who want to have a meal at any given moment of the day , restaurants are open the entire day . 
  yes , but i wan na eat at 1700 when i get off from work . 
  i 'm a man with set timetable on my daily routine . 
  wake up at 6am , eat a big breakfast . 
  at work by 7am , do work ( reddit ) .
