so finland is annexing land from the baltic ~ ~ s ~ ~ ? 
  unrelated to international politics , yes . 
  the ban is for internal russian basketball federation squabbling , rbf is seen as having insufficient control over the game in the country as a result, 
  unfinished houses are a way of tax evasion available for anyone who owns said unfinished house . 
  property taxes are n't assesed on houses still under construction , so houses are intentionally left 95 % finished so you do n't have to pay taxes on them . 
  you do realize , that when you include someones username in your post , it pops up in their inbox just like replies to their own posts , do n't you ? 
  there 's sauna , and ... more sauna ? 
  i think ` breading ' is the word you 're looking for . 
  it 's when you toss in eggs and then bread crumbs , so both ` breading ' and ` crumbing ' would be logical , but english is rarely logical . 
  google definitely finds more results for breaded , but i 'm not if ` crumbed ' is a variation in technique or just a different name for it . 
  in stores , button mushrooms is the only common alternative , although chanterelles turn up in the summer even in smaller stores , and bigger supermarkets will have shiitake , cepes and such . 
  mushroom picking is a part of going to the summer cottage for people i know , depending on the land surrounding it . 
  ( the last statistic i remember seeing was that more than half of all finns will spend at least a weekend at a cottage in any given year , but i ca n't really say how many people go picking ) . 
  personally i look for chanterelles , [ funnel chanterelles , aka yellowfoots ( yellowfeet ? 
  ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craterellus_tubaeformis ) and [ black trumpets , aka horns of plenty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craterellus_cornucopioides ) . 
  they all make killer cream sauces or creamy soups . 
  svt would be the swedish analogy here , i think . 
  the majority of that is n't france though . 
  financial reports might have this broken down by country , but i 'm too lazy to find those , so i 'll do some ballpark math : i found some report stating about 40 % of revenue is from europe , i 'm guessing by comparing french gdp to eu totals at most 20 % of that is from france , so 8 % of global revenue , or around 100 million . 
  i think it 's just a translation issue . 
  most of my friends who have kids call having sole control of the kids and house what i would translate as babysitting, 
  yes . 
  they 're suing eca ( which runs euroleague and eurocup ) alleging misuse of a monopoly and discriminatory practices . 
  and then said any national federation that allows teams they govern to take part in eca competitions is banned from senior national team competitions . 
  reading between the lines , it seems like eca said any teams in their competitions are n't allowed to participate in fibas own planned european club competition ( whether any of them would have wanted to is unclear ) , and fiba responded in kind with the only leverage they have , banning the senior national teams . 
  a hissy fit of the highest order , but who knows about the underlying legal case . 
  he sounds like a lovely slav . 
  overstay rate and visa rejection rate are 2 different things , both of which need to be under 3 % for e few year for the visa waiver programme, 
  it was probably a model of one of the helsinki-stockholm or turku-stockholm ferries/cruisers , those are a lot nicer ( because it 's an overnight trip usually ), 
  to be fair , yrj\u00f6 is a traditional first name , the translation of george , in fact . 
  so it might be george of the swamp ( like george of the jungle ) . 
  as an aside , king george was king vomit in finnish , saint george was saint vomit , and so on . 
  how is it strange to you that you are liable for damages and injuries you cause with your actions ? 
  and that you can take out out insurance to cover your ass ? 
  he 's talking about the cost of other means of production falling , meaning they can charge a lower price and still have the same profit , meaning solar producers also have to lower prices , or people will just buy from other producers . 
  whether that actually would have happened is another matter entirely , but the argument that it could happen is sound enough . 
  the title is extremely misleading . 
  if you read the study , they conclude that * 22 % * of overall lowering of pisa scores is attributable to increased immigration . 
  the 85 % figure is talking about those who fail to qualify for * gymnasieskola * ( equivalent of high school ) . 
  85 % of the increase in people who failed to qualify can be attributed to increased number of children immigrating after the age they would have started school in sweden . 
  i think you 're misreading that yourself . 
  they 're talking about people who immigrated as older than first-graders ( that is , they 're talking about the overall start to schooling , not the start in whatever year the test was performed ) , so they missed out on some years of swedish education . 
  i see what you did there, 
  my guess would be bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur = mountain-wolf ( bjerg + ulfr ) , but i do n't speak icelandic . 
  that 's my guess based on norwegian and swedish . 
  could be borg = castle or bj\u00f6rk = birch . 
  or bj\u00f6rk = bizarro singer , i suppose . 
  by this logic firebombing a synagogue in europe is n't terrorism , as it 's only an attack on a clear subset of society , not the whole society, 
  time to genetically engineer some white-leaved trees , you mean . 
  that 's what they 're called here in east sweden as well . 
  the article talks about the current theory being an improvised firecracker of some sort . 
  kids not realizing how dangerous firecrackers can be in sufficient quantity is hardly new . 
  that was the fictional capital of the also fictional eastern european nation sokovia . 
  do n't think it was filmed in tallinn either . 
  solution : sauna on the moon . 
  good grief with the clickbait . 
  `` not seen since almost an entire year ago !! 1 ! '', 
  did these levels last february mean something drastic , i 'd say no . 
  does n't seem like anything more than normal fluctuation at this point . 
  kids movies are generally dubbed , but you can find english versions with subs in smaller theaters usually . 
  yeah , marked difference here in helsinki . 
  went from significantly over average temps all december to significantly below for most of january so far . 
  some stats pictures : [ daily lowest temperature , helsinki ] ( http://imgur.com/kz11bih ) [ daily highest temperature , helsinki ] ( http://imgur.com/hwk69uh ) the shaded areas are 25 % and 75 % intervals around the mean . 
   think of russia 's new neighbors . 
  romania , poland , finland , norway , uk , germany , ... not exactly the most friendly set . 
  they alredy border norway , finland and poland though . 
  because it needs to match `` det '' den \u00e4r sann ( `` it 's true '' , but this does n't really make sense without any context about what it alludes to , like maybe `` i do n't believe your story . 
  - but it 's true ! '' ), 
  det \u00e4r sant ( a general `` that is true '' . 
  typically general statements are with `` det '' , specific ones will be either den or det depending on the word it alludes to ), 
  taxes are also forced labour . 
  you 're literally forced to give a substantial fraction of the fruits of your labour to the state , just like someone conscripted is forced to give a fraction of their time to the state . 
  this is of course assuming you can refuse armed service , as you can in the conscription countries i 'm familiar with . 
  conscription is simply something the government has decided is an efficient way of providing for the defense of the country . 
  do n't like it ? 
  vote in someone who will change it . 
  you 're also forced to go to school from ages 7-16 , do you feel that is also an affront to modern society ? 
  vaccines are n't 100 % , so vaccinating as many as possible becomes important as it strongly decreases the chance that someone for whom the vaccine did n't work comes into contact with a carrier of the disease . 
  it 's called herd immunity if you want to look it up . 
  well , mean monthly income for sweden that i found was 31k sek , so 25k starting salary does n't seem strange at all to me . 
  that 's easy enough , lottery winnings are n't taxable income . 
  so you 'd just need to invest it in something that does n't produce any income ( non-dividend paying stocks , speculativevreal estate , whatever ), 
  i mean , you could run the blood through dna sequencing and store that . 
  not sure if that would be as binding as actual blood, 
  it 's actually about 94 % finns ( this includes those that speak swedish , very few actual swedes live here ) , 3 % other europeans ( mostly estonians and russians ) , 3 % non-europeans . 
  if you 're going to be racist , at least get your facts straight . 
  helsinki is also only about 85 % finns , in this meaning . 
  [ here 's years 1-9 ] ( http://www.minedu.fi/export/sites/default/opm/koulutus/yleissivistaevae_koulutus/liitetiedostoja/distribution_of_lesson_hours_in_basic_educ.pdf ) if you have trouble reading that table , it for example means that in years 6-9 , you have 14 hours per week of mother language/literature studies . 
  how it 's spread out is left to the school , probably two years of 4 hours per week , and two years of 3 hours per week . 
  it looks like about an hour a week on average of religion/ethics , 2 hours sports ( physical education ) . 
  [ years 10-12 ] ( https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/finland:teaching_and_learning_in_general_upper_secondary_education ) these numbers are slightly different , but it 's roughly the same : 1 means 1 hour per week , on average . 
  spread over three years . 
  so here it 's 1 hour per week of religion , a 2/3 hour per week sports . 
  ( these are the compulsory courses . 
  about 1/3 of your course load is what you choose , so you could do more of these if you wanted ) computer science will fall under the ` optional ' title , it 's up to the school to decide when ( or if ) that 's offered . 
  i ca n't say i have any first-hand knowledge of how it is these days . 
  as for languages , the compulsory ones are finnish , swedish and ( usually ) english . 
  you can start picking an extra language in 5th grade ( might be 7th , again , it 's been a while since i was there ) . 
  french , german , russian were the ` normal ' ones available in most schools when i was in , spanish and latin were offered in some places . 
  i 've only ever seen rosolli served around christmas here .
