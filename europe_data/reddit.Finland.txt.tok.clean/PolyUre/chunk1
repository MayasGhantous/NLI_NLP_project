as someone who really dislikes the cold , you just get used to it . 
  it 's like some annoying task that has to be dealt with , only that it lasts several months . 
  the thought of summer helps . 
  no wonder why online banking got so popular so fast in finland . 
  i had the impression , that the station would be only for intercity trains , and there would be probably be only routes to p\u00e4rnu , tartu and st. petersburg . 
   \\ - - as racist as suggesting blacks really enjoy chicken and watermelon - - it 's not racist to suggest that blacks enjoy chicken and watermelon ( [ c'mon , who does n't ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeq0zm-njyq ) ) , it 's racist to suggest they enjoy them because they are black . 
   sweden were in a bad position though . 
  either they could 've helped finland and indirectly the nazis which would 've pissed off denmark , norway and all of the allies . 
  finland and germany had no alliance whatsoever during the winter war . 
  germany did n't even send supplies because of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  not to mention that operation weser\u00fcbung started only after the winter war . 
  similarly to the support finland received during the winter war ? 
  neighbouring countries found it quite amusing that only submarine captured or sunk during ub\u00e5tsjakter was the one that crashed on its own on the back yard of a naval base .

  it should be noted that subtitles also increase reading proficiency on one 's own language , since even one half hour episode has surprisingly many lines . 
  that does n't necessarily make it a funnier show . 
  he even got nicknamed as murha-kustaa ( murder gustaf ) among the left . 
   because most cops in england and wales do n't carry guns . 
  carrying a sidearm does n't necessarily lead to fatal shootings . 
  finnish police carry weapons , but latest fatal shooting was five years ago , and even that was after a siege . 
  finnish has quite a few expressions for extreme drunkenness . 
  here are some others : - olla tuubassa , literally * be in a tuba * - olla naamat , literally * be faces * - olla ( umpi ) tunnelissa , literally * be in a ( dead end ) tunnel * - olla seip\u00e4\u00e4ss\u00e4 , literally * be in a pole *, 
  the gdp per capita you used is adjusted with purchasing power parity , and places the eu in 41st place . 
  nominal gdp per capita has eu at 30th . 
  you also used gdp ppp for gdp , when the nominal one is $ 16.95 trillion .

  [ minttu ] ( http://www.alko.fi/en/products/003002// ) and [ salmiakkikoskenkorva ] ( http://www.alko.fi/en/products/131246/ ) are some quite finnish spirits . 
  usually the former is a foreigner favourite , the latter not so much . 
  next the trams ? 
   or you could ... abolish the forced labor . 
  yes , i 'm very much in favor of getting rid of conscription , and as such do n't see women 's conscription as a good thing . 
   are you going to argue that the u.s. should n't have stopped slavery , because it made life worse for the whites benifiting off slavery well , it is a valid argument , if you accept the premise that there is n't a problem with slavery , and slaves are property , not people . 
  problem with your slavery argument is following : - expanding the conscription to women doubles the `` slave '' population , and does n't increase men 's position , as they still have to serve . 
  - abolishing slavery removes slave population , and so increases slaves ' position . 
  these two are not clearly analogious . 
   for example people like you -- my honest first reaction was laughter . 
  i oppose conscription , so it 's only logical that i also oppose women 's conscription . 
  it should be noted `` were in favour of maintaining some form of compulsory military service in the country . '', 
  includes things like possibility of conscription in the event of war , which is quite common even in the states with all voluntary military . 
  [ the finnish version of the news ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/skn_kysely_puolet_suomalaisista_kannattaa_nykyista_asevelvollisuutta/6864721 ) states that half of the respondents think that changeover in the system is needed . 
  male only conscription is n't equal , i thought that was well established , and there was n't argument there . 
  i argued against forcing women to serve too , since it does n't add any value _ and _ forwarding equality with worsening overall conditions seems quite backwards logic . 
  equality does n't mean that everybody is equally miserable . 
   they 're probably never going to get rid of the conscription here who are they ? 
  yeah , but why ? 
  just because men have to too ? 
  it makes no sense to worsen conditions for one side to create equality . 
  civilian service is n't there because it 's profitable , but because an alternative for military service is usually needed . 
  usually the train of thought is following : - we do not want to force people into army , because it goes against the values of the nation and leads easily to bigger problems . 
  - so now we have people who wo n't go to army , but need to be doing something , or else we are setting a precedent , that you can skip the whole ordeal by just declining to serve in the army . 
  - doing at least something productive while living on your own is much cheaper than jail , so civilian service is a logical choice . 
  in my experience people move , and it 's expected of them , so nobody is offended , because they would do the exactly same thing . 
   this is a bit counter-intuitive . 
  i always thought of sweden as very socially involved - to a point where lost child can bother random pedestrian and ask them to be walked home . 
  yeah , if you 're in a need of an assistance , you 'll get help , because now there 's a reason for communication , but do n't expect small talk . 
  well , _ often _ might be an exaggeration , but [ here 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/god_gene ) something about the concept . 
  could you expand a little bit ? 
  i was addressing this biological phenomen . 
  it 's often argued that humans without prior knowledge of religion will become religious on their own , as if it 's something that is hard coded in what being a human is . 
  this right here hints otherwise , but is n't obviously infallible truth . 
  it shows that people without religious tradition do n't usually grow religious , as opposed to religiousness being the natural state for humans . 
   when you quoted me you carefully cut of the part where i said that i was n't trying to argue that point . 
  i am aware of these statistics . 
  i just wanted to use your post to bring the statistics up , as they might mitigate the fears , nothing to do directly with your point , which is true . 
  i understand that people react with emotion , but we must base our decision on facts . 
   planes are statistically speaking safer , but that does n't really enter into people 's perception of the risks . 
  this is the reason of bringing the numbers up . 
  repetition on valid information will eventually lead to more informed decisions . 
   yes , it is a good thing that incompetence , corruption and cutting corners will never happen anywhere else . 
  according to who , chernobyl 's disaster 's casualties are about 0.5 % of annual casualties caused by the coal plants . 
  so if we 'd have 200 similar accidents _ every year _ we 'd be at same death rate . 
  those are chances i 'm willing to take any day . 
  i thought we were discussing the matter of being the monarch , not just part of the royal family , in which case the regicide would n't help , as i 'm not part of the succession . 
  ah , but there are few caveats . 
  a ) i would n't have any place in the succession anyhow , my offsprings maybe , but i would n't . 
  b ) i 'm not a member of the anglican church , nor any kind of protestant , and that automatically disqualifies me from the succession . 
  i 'm available for the job .

  i 'll let you in on a secret : it 's never good , you just smoke or drink too much . 
  in finland people usually eat at franchise run burger joints ( mcd , bk , and local hesburger ) , immigrant run pizza & kebab places or at sn\u00e4g\u00e4ri ( a slang word from english snack bar , also known as nakkikioski - [ knackwurst ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knackwurst ) kiosk , or grill kiosk ) from [ sn\u00e4g\u00e4ri ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/grillikioski_helsinki.jpg ) you can order [ lihapiirakka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lihapiirakka ) - meat pie , [ makkaraperunat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/makkaraperunat2.jpg ) - sausage potatoes ( sausages , fries , relish , ketchup , mustard etc. 
  ) , [ porilainen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porilainen ) , hamburgers and hot dogs . 
  lihapiirakka , makkaraperunat and porilainen being more finnish choices . 
   i like your kebab pizza though , fucking hell , i 've never seen those outside of sweden . 
  finland has it also . 
  our pizza culture is quite similar to the swedish one , except we do n't have those peach-banana-jam monstrosities .
