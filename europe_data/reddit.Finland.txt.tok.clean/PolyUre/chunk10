  alko and vinmonopolet do the same thing , but the results are n't nearly as prominent as in sweden . 
  main difference that comes to my mind is the abv of the beer in the markets , but are there others ? 
  is the reason for sweden 's high ranking that all the over 3,5 % beers are already in systemet so if you go there , why not grab some wine also/instead ?

   each country , before it joins , specifies which language it wants to have used as an official language for eu purposes . 
  not every language that has official status domestically is put forward for official eu status .

   from wiki :   this led to virtually every household making and selling alcohol . 
  at the beginning of the 1800s , the swedish people were drinking a lot of alcohol , from 175,000 distillers ( most of them for household-production only ) , using tremendous amounts of grain and potatoes that otherwise would have been consumed as food , and it was later said that most men in sweden abused alcohol . 
  i could n't find any numbers on the consumption on the earliest stages , might you have them ? 
  ( swedish is fine ) the thing i do know is that the problem government had with distilling was that taxes were paid in grain , and government wanted their taxes , and they wanted them in full . 
  studies also show that the village society controlled drinking efficiently , and problems arose when the pietism led attitudes made being drunk in public a crime . 
   tldr is that there was a huge alcohol problem in sweden and to solve that the first strict laws on selling alcohol was introduced care to elaborate this huge alcohol problem ? 
  it 's an excuse to drink beer . 
  nokia made two billion dollars profit last year .

  yet not in the eu , which was my point . 
  you can not say anything about the workings of the border just by the non-eu status . 
   just like any land boarder between eu - and non-eu-countries . 
  there is n't one such thing . 
  finland 's border with norway is quite different from the border with russia .

  the parliament passed an emergency law to extend his presidency by four years .

  like , what 's up with those separate hot and cold taps . 
  rome always had legions , they became standing legions in 107 bc as a result of marian reforms . 
  this is part of my ire on the video . 
  it states that the legionaries had to supply their own equipment ( this is true only pre marian reforms ) , but then states that the centuriae formed cohortes ( this is true only post marian reforms , before that they formed manipulus ), 
  quite nicely presented info , but could have been a bit more detailed . 
  was this structure in use for all roman history ? 
  if not , what did it replace / what replaced it ? 
  when was it in use ?

  there 's also a ingenious way to prevent drowning .

  * seurusteluviini * is the code lingo for a wine you want to get drunk on , instead of drinking it with food . 
   we vikings are n't that good at it anymore , we 've been weakened by the state monopoly and insanely high taxes on alcohol . 
  that only should bring out your a-game , as in bringing loads of alcohol from southern neighbours , preferring hard liquor over beer since you can carry more , and quantity over quality . 
  it works for finns . 
  similar principle applies for finnish rally drivers : expensive gasoline and shitty roads make a driver .

  have been to sompasauna ? 
  nobody would look you twice if you 'd had beer in the sauna . 
  ( kiuasmakkara , btw , is delicious ), 
  sure , for example swimming hall saunas are usually quite strict about all beverages , but that does n't mean that public saunas altogether are against them .
