  in finland there 's no hard limit where you lose your licence , but usually you have to get at least 22 day fines ( about 36 to 38 km/h over in 50km/h zone ) , not 26 over as the graph suggests . 
  if you check the stats from their own site you 'll also note that they have 100km/h as a common limit outside urban areas , but in finland this is actually 80km/h , so i 'd take their data with a grain of salt . 
  there is n't anything worth annexing ?

   alcohol causes damage up to 158 billion euros per year in the eu , it probably does cause harm in the czech republic as well . 
  with that kind of cost you 'd think it would be beneficial to ban the whole thing altogether , no ? 
   everyone ( almost ) know it 's bad , but it 's hard coded into our culture , hence we still need to have something to control our behaviour , systembolaget . 
  you do n't think that the forbidden fruit aspect is one of the main points why the current drinking culture is so focused on binge drinking ? 
  in finland the prohibition changed the drinking landscape from beer dominated to drinking spirits since they were smaller in size ( and thus easier to hide and sell ) and encouraged to drink everything you had , so there were no damning evidence to be found . 
  you can make your own by mixing red vermouth and gin so it ends up at about 20 % abv .

  my friend 's opinion is that * noniin * is not the most important phrase , but * no vittu * is , which translates as `` well fuck '' , but otherwise functions identically to * noniin * .

  oh , i misunderstood . 
  i thought you meant that on every pair of seats there 's only one person , meaning that `` there are other spaces '' than just a place next to hot girl . 
  what do you mean , why would n't you sit next to an attractive girl if you have a perfectly acceptable reason to sit next to a one ?

  in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm494xyj104 ) m\u00e4kki sings `` aito m\u00e4kki ei oo rantaryss\u00e4 , vaan aito oikee virolainen '' which is something like * aito m\u00e4kki is not a tibla , but a real estonian * , but on the text has been translated `` aito m\u00e4kki pole sibul ega tibla , tegu on t\u00e4itsa ehtsa eestlasega .

  reminds me about the uk , where the doors of bathroom stalls open inwards , which makes it more difficult to get in and close the door . 
  when this was questioned the locals provided an explanation : if the lock is broken you can hold the door with your hand so others ca n't enter . 
  whereas in finland the doors open outwards and if the lock is broken somebody will fix it .

  jatkosodan pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen makes a good case for how finns and germans planned the attack together and how the finnish government told the germans that it would attack , but it had to look like a defensive war . 
  ajopuuteoria , which you are advocating , has been discredited . 
  finnish government was in communication with the germans with the idea of `` we 'll attack with you as soon as we are bombed first '' , and had the bombings not come , finland would 've attacked still .

  i 'd say that mulkku is milder than kyrp\u00e4 , but cock is a bit more crude than dick or prick .
