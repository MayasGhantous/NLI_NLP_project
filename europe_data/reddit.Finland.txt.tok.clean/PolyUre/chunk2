  we also sometimes ( especially during some sporting events ) call swedes as the gladstone ganders , which tells something about our relationship with the swedes .

  i present to you , [ house of lords !,

   i kinda view it like a part of our national identity . 
  our queen has a direct and unbroken line all the way back to when our nation was formed , ~ 1100 years ago ... 
  her great great great ( and so on ) father conquered and united our kingdom in around ~ 950 ad . 
  the fact that she 's still here and about just feels right to me  [ descendant of ancient english tyrants to wed ] ( http://boingboing.net/ttdb/20110426/comic.jpg/1035cbcomic%20news%20-%20descendant.jpg ),

  you can basically walk in to some of the faculties . 
  yup . 
  you have to buy them yourself :(, 
  well , completely legal is n't really relevant . 
  schwarzgebrannter is n't legal , but you would n't question if someone said that spirits are legal in germany .

  productivity might remain the same or even rise when people idle less during the day , and at the same time they are happier because of more free time . 
  of all the surstr\u00f6mming videos , [ madcook 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovayky9lfrw ) version is the most entertaining . 
   well to be fair , it 's the press that came up with the true finns name . 
  they got it from the website of perussuomalaiset . 
  / how can you govern a country which has two hundred and forty-six varieties of cheese ? 
  / within ten years , we shall have the means to kill 80 million russians . 
  i truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80 million russians , even if one can kill 800 million french , that is if there were 800 million french . 
  their opening hours are quite bad and during holidays they are often closed altogether , which leads to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/whzfzjk.jpg ) kind of situations . 
  after a long binge of drinking with the booze posse , there rises an argument about what somebody has said or done and in the end someone gets stabbed . 
  the average joe has a next to none chance of getting killed in such a way . 
   people still speak awful swedish if even that . 
  yup , but we speak fairly good english , and it 's not even mandatory !, 
  if a celebrity speeds in such a manner , it 's news .

   every single time he did something ( no matter how minor ) it would be big news , and there would be calls for his abdication or the abolishment of the monarchy .

   either way , your comment is rather unnecessary , on top of being smug and irritating . 
  [ it 's not smug if it 's true . 
   americans are patriotic as fuck , and everybody is fine with that . 
  american patriotism with its pledges of allegiance , support our troops mantras and endless seas of star-spangled banners everywhere the eye sees and quite frowned upon . 
  even the first division hockey gets more attendance than highest tier football . 
  currently the finnish law prohibits trading of nuclear waste .

  similar to the [ birthday skeleton ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l30hs.jpg ) ? 
  well , it 's relevant information . 
  on the similar note : http://finnishproblems.tumblr.com/, 
   finland is supposedly the least corrupt nation in the world alongside us our corruption is n't brown envelopes and get free from jail cards , but effective old boy networks and nice ceo spot in a government run organization . 
  much more difficult to trace . 
   the initial impression might be a bit weird because of the disconnect of what the characters are speaking vs. what they should be speaking , but that goes away quickly and then you only perceive meaning not language . 
  with dubbing one misses almost all plays on words and original intonation . 
   and the monarch of vatican city is the pope . 
  title pope is a clerical title , not in direct relation with the sovereignty of vatican city . 
  this leads to following conclusion : pope is n't a title to describe secular rulers , pope ( as a person ) is also a monarch , but is n't called prince , grand duke , emperor or etc. 
  so it 's only logical to use the default naming for a male monarch : king . 
   i wonder where cgpgrey got this idea that the pope is `` king '' of the vatican . 
  well his official title is sovereign of the state of the vatican city . 
  vatican city is a monarchy and king is a word used to describe male monarchs .

  akasa just summarizes british foreign policy , also brought up in yes minister :  sir humphrey appleby : minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last 500 years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
   james hacker : that 's all ancient history , surely . 
   sir humphrey appleby : yes , and current policy . 
  we had to break the whole thing up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
   james hacker : surely we 're all committed to the european ideal . 
   sir humphrey appleby : really , minister . 
  [ laughs ]  james hacker : if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
   sir humphrey appleby : well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact . 
  the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up . 
  the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
   james hacker : what appalling cynicism . 
   sir humphrey appleby : yes . 
  we call it diplomacy , minister .

   they have threatened with moving their hq to another country if they did n't get their way in certain cases , for example when the government has toyed with changing taxation laws in a way that would not be beneficial for maersk .

   sweden democrats -- unlike true finns -- bears the burden of formerly having people affiliated with neo-nazism in its high ranks . 
  true finns -- on the other hand -- have always drawn a strong distinction from nazism , and enjoy a much wider popular support . 
  true finns do n't have problems with right wing symphatizing , unless media picks it up . 
  this lack of media interference is probably one of the reasons why they enjoy quite high support . 
  here are some cases about their flirting with far right : * the most recent one : true finns mp [ james hirvisaari ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_hirvisaari ) brought a right wing activist [ seppo lehto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seppo_lehto ) to parliament . 
  in parliament lehto made a nazi salute , which hirvisaari photographed . 
  after media uproar hirvisaari was kicked out of the party . 
  until recently hirvisaari also was a member of a right wing group [ suomen sisu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_sisu ) . 
  * also this autumn : true finns member of kangasala city council , jari viinikainen , made a nazi salute with group of neo nazis while having a ** hitler mask on his head ** during a hetero pride event in helsinki . 
  first he claimed that it was photoshopped , but when evidence became overwhelming he said that `` it was a joke '' , `` it was n't even a real nazi salute '' and `` i made it on purpose with wrong hand , because hey , i 'm not a nazi ! '', 
  on regard of the hitler mask , he told that he bought it from thailand for a jazz event in asikkala , where ** hirvisaari ** invited him . 
  he also claimed that media was n't fair in their treatment of him because of his true finns membership . 
  he was later kicked from the party . 
  * [ juho eerola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juho_eerola ) , one true finns ' chairmen was also a member of suomen sisu . 
  he resigned in 2012 , not because of group 's agenda , but * because media was using it against him and true finns . 
  * in 2011 it was revealed that his aide had applied for membership in a neo-nazi group [ finnish resistance movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_resistance_movement ) * more on hirvisaari : in 2011 he was found guilty of incitement and fined , and in 2012 his aide helena eronen alledgely satirically wrote two blog posts , where she suggested that foreigners and sexual minorities should wear armbands . 
  hirvisaari was expelled for five months when he claimed that eronen had done nothing wrong .
