  * olli immonen , a true finns mp , is the current chairman of the suomen sisu group . 
  * in 2012 , a true finns mp [ jussi halla-aho ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jussi_halla-aho ) , was found guilty of both disturbing religious worship and ethnic agitation , because of his writing where he compared islam to paedophilia . 
  after the supreme court verdict he claimed that [ he being guilty ] `` was just an opinion of few individuals '' after his comment caused huge amounts of comments in media , he resigned from the administration committee 's chairman 's post . 
  these are just some cases , there are more examples both in national ( [ teuvo hakkarainen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teuvo_hakkarainen ) and pentti oinonen ) and municipal level . 
   `` war on drugs '' is a failure and essentially a useless tying up of resources and money , and creates funding for crime syndicates , now let 's do the same with tobacco !, 
  tobacco has been handled quite opposite ways in regards of war on drugs . 
  it 's still available for purchase , but increased * dispassionate * education on health effects and overall mentality on uncoolness of smoking has made it possible to institute effective bans on usage .

   it 's something we always can get behind , since there is no political ideolgy involved . 
  i 'd wager that being able to get elected as head of the state is considered as a political ideology .

  they sound a lot like our [ finns party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns_party ) . 
  `` the party combines left-wing economic policies with conservative social values , socio-cultural authoritarianism , and ethnic nationalism . 
  several researchers have described the party as fiscally centre-left , socially conservative , a `` centre-based populist party '' or the `` most left-wing of the non-socialist parties '' , whereas other scholars have described them as radically right-wing populist . '', 
  i do n't really watch american tv that much , but i see why you could think that . 
  i consider liberals as people who try to maximize personal liberties ( sometimes being called social liberals as opposed to economic liberals aka . 
  right wingers ) , and conservatives as people who try to keep to status quo . 
  almost always these goals conflict . 
  this labeling does not bother with state 's involvement to economics , since that 's easily taken care of with left-right axis . 
  this labeling draws quite a lot from political compass ' [ test ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/analysis ) and analysis . 
   progress party ( frp ) is liberal-conservative . 
  ok , you really need to clarify something to me . 
  are n't liberals and conservatives opposite ends of one political axis ? 
  usually they are quite bland .

  it 's the [ \u00d8resundsbron . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98resund_bridge ), 
  it should be noted that the costs would probably go up during construction period . 
  the metro extension is a good example of this , original cost approximations were 400 million euros . 
  ferries will probably still be a lot cheaper for bringing booze . 
  gustav vasa established helsinki as a trading competitor for tallinn , in 1550 .

   well , that is why there is the title `` regent '' . 
  the uk has n't had one for 250 years or so , but i guess the concept still stands . 
  yup , harry would be named the regent . 
  the silly part was that the throne is baby 's ** birthright ** , so the argument does n't really change even if there should n't be a need for a regency . 
   still do n't know what he meant by `` what does this mean about europe ? '', 
  probably he 's just putting all europe together and asking why there is this ancient relic called monarchy . 
  i think he 's trying to point out how outdated and absurd it 's that the baby would be the monarch , if something fatal were to happen to those in front of him in the line to throne . 
  but in my opinion , it 's more reasonable way to get the throne [ than how some other have done it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dootka0agi0 ) . 
  or how it 's in english :  within ten years , we shall have the means to kill 80 million russians . 
  i truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80 million russians , even if one can kill 800 million french , that is if there were 800 million french . 
  i did n't say it 's a fair choice . 
  you did n't btw answer my question regarding edward , should he decided to not abdicate . 
   leopold iii for example could either abdicate or see the entire government resign . 
  the resulting elections would see a pro-republican coalition and a constitutional rewrite . 
  there was already a huge and violent general strike in large parts of the country to force his abdication , with 4 fatalities so far . 
  this just shows that governing power just ultimately derives from the mandate of the masses , even if it 's a oppressive hereditary position . 
  it does n't mean leopold did n't make the decision himself . 
  ( for examples on opposite case , see : ludvig xvi ), 
  on both cases the abdication was their own choice in the end . 
  if edward would have wanted to both be the king and marry simpson , what lawful choices would the parliament had about it ? 
   having said that though maybe that just prevents more radical religious types from exerting an influence like they do in the usa which has true `` religious freedom '' . 
  unlikely , european republics tend to be quite unreligious . 
  and if they happen to be complete fuck-ups they still get the position .

  one could argue that hugo vickers might be biased on the subject .

   conscripts are expensive , but i \u00b4 d argue that they make you a better , more mature person once you are done .

  he would n't be able to pursuit his entrepreneurial interests if he would be a member of royal family hence he does n't have the need for swedish citizenship .
