   people use words that are a bit old-fashioned and formal , and 1980 's , swedish pop somehow never went out of style there . 
  they also have a habit of mixing swedish and finnish when they speak . 
  as an example of this i have heard a story when writing his swedish essay a guy asks his swedish-speaking friend for help for the word * chauffeur * and gets told that it 's * en kusk * , which is derived from finnish * kuski * . 
  teacher had written with big bold red letters ** chauff\u00f6r !, 
  ** next to it . 
  as for the swedish pop , it never went out of fashion in the finnish-speaking circles either . 
  swedish-speaking finns . 
  just like finnish-speaking finns , but on average a bit happier , richer , more stylish and social . 
  it 's said that they are tied with american jews as the most successful minority in the world . 
   sweden is n't going to blanket give him a promise to never extradite him to the us , that 's an impossible promise given the treaties it breaks . 
  most countries refuse to extradite suspects of political crimes . 
  it 's just a question of political will , which sweden clearly lacks here . 
  could you also explain how assange 's alledged rape ties to extraditing him to us ? 
  he 's suspected on a crime committed in sweden against the swedish law . 
  extraditing him on the basis of whistleblowing is completely different matter , and against that he has asked guarantees . 
   they cant promise people anything regarding outcomes in trials , no matter what . 
  how does an alledged rape and trial for that in sweden got anything to do with extraditing him ? 
  i 'd say that one bottle is closer to five glasses than four . 
  [ or sometimes there are two choices . 
  a heroic struggle where we turned back hordes after hordes of russians with the help of no one at all . 
  people really do n't reminiscent the alliance with the germans or the initiating of a full blown offensive war , the continuation war . 
  they are part of the nord pool , so they do n't rely only on their own production . 
  being part of the financial energy market ensures that consumers are n't left without electricity , but it shows as [ higher prices ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/electricity-prices-europe.jpg ) if there 's lot of demand . 
  this post is mostly about the natural effects on the grid , such as heavy wind , snow , and fallen trees . 
  other points are the energy company 's readiness to fix the grid in case of these natural disaster and the state of urbanisation . 
  considering the nature of current conflicts even fdf has shifted their scope to strategical strikes and preventing them . 
  russia would strike with missiles to central infrastructure points , such as few select transformer stations and repeat their demands , which most likely would n't include annexation of the country . 
  fdf has already limited the war time strength to 230 000 men from the 700 000 during the cold war . 
  there is n't a need for the current system , but as the status quo , it 's easy to keep . 
  i do n't see the relevance when you also said `` half of the initial 250,000 ** are dead ** . '', 
  but sure , we can also talk about the injured . 
  continuation war lasted over three years , which is plenty of time to train more troops to the front if large part of original troops were to perish . 
  transferring that to current day also requires the conflict to be long winded one with established fronts , which is something of a rarity nowadays , but hey , this is your scenario . 
  winter war : 26 000 dead , continuation war : 63 000 dead . 
   ah but we earn more because we 're men - - i 'm not going to step on the subject of `` is the wage gap result of biology , sociological landscape or a mixture of those ? '', 
  but that does n't still have anything to do with the taxation . 
  taxation does n't care of the gender , anything written in the tax law does n't mention gender . 
  not to mention , if people want to pay less taxes , they can by their own choices earn less . 
  similar is n't possible with the conscription . 
   what happens once half of the initial 250,000 are dead - - peace talks . 
  probably a lot sooner than after the onslaught of over hundred thousand people . 
   taxation varies hugely by gender and by a multitude of factors . 
  multitude of factors * within the power of the taxed * , such as the amount of money earned . 
  men pay more taxes than women because they , on average , earn more , not because they are men . 
  otherwise i do n't know of taxes directed to one gender only ? 
   presumably because the fdf realise that to stand a hope of defending the country from invasion you 'd need everyone to be part of the war effort , not just those who 'd felt like going to conscription for a year . 
  being part of the war effort and being part of the army are not the same thing . 
  our constitution currently says that all citizens have a duty to defend the country , which during the crisis translates to forced labour , military service , and civil defense among others . 
  just a while ago reservists received letters telling their position during an armed conflict . 
  out of 900 000 sent letters , only some 250 000 had a position assigned . 
  those 650 000 will do the same things that civilians would do during conflict . 
  there 's no need for all of them to serve . 
   it 's not a request , it 's a demand . 
  that 's mainly semantics , but agreed . 
   it 's not really any morally worse than taxation tbh sure it is , taxation does n't differentiate between genders or other things not in one 's decision-making power . 
  not to mention that fdf always parrots that finns are by and large willing to defend finland , why not give those less willing a pass , since over two thirds of the current reserve is already without meaningful duties . 
  or maybe the mystical will to defend finland is just a charade that everybody must keep repeating or it disappears ? 
  you could even sweeten the deal for those who decide to serve and agree to regular refreshment training by giving tax benefits . 
  then there would be no need to train the worst lot , as you could pick and choose from all the willing . 
  i 'd decline other morally questionable requests from the state as well . 
  giving a shitty alternative for an even more shitty choice is n't `` being reasonable . '', 
  as a human being , i want me and myself only to decide if i have to go to war . 
  it 's all about brand management . 
  your stats are really old . 
  [ 36 % of finns ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/yha_useampi_nuori_aikuinen_kayttaa_kannabista/5417805 ) have at least tried , and that number is from * 2011 * . 
  if he does politics by presenting himself as `` a leading ethics crusader '' and then snorts coke off of hooker 's tits , there might be reason to bring it to public knowledge . 
   ( read : entrapment ) entrapment is related only to law enforcement officers . 
  well , nuuti hyttinen , the originator of the idea , is also a board member of suomen sisu , in addition to ps and ps-nuoret, 
  almost all my favourites have been already mentioned , but not all . 
  here 's [ hell march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=096hnkdw5tc ) with appropriate imagery . 
   here 's some meta [ 1 ] to help show the differences . 
  [ this ] ( http://d5lx5634mkgoi.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/vennvenn2.png ) is the original , where joke actually works . 
   i 'm in finland and the english language gets me nowhere here . 
  i 've heard that even the english have problems with scottish accents . 
  when combined with food , for example in [ sittning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sittning ) , jaloviina is commonly ` avec ' coffee ( other ` avec ' choice being punsch ) , while during the starters and main course koskenkorva is the spirit of choice . 
  [ this picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/venn_and_euler_diagram_of_3-ary_boolean_relations.svg ) will help to demonstrate the differences . 
  it 's \u00f6sterbottniska swedish . 
  similar jpop in finnish [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmjzhgbjgmk ), 
  that 's not even close to real finnish rally english . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4wwqhodtyk ) of the traditional finnish accent . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovayky9lfrw ) a version with fairly good english subtitles . 
  that would be the reasonable approach , but how do they differentiate ? 
  your consumption statistics are buffed by all the finns buying their booze from tallinn . 
  i have understood that heikki refers specifically to hundred grams , usually in relation to illegal substances . 
  no , no , from their point of view the filter is working wonders . 
  those still remembering the whole filter are tinfoily nerds , and filter just keeps filtering some sites that nobody is allowed to know . 
   on the other hand , no debate is ever going to happen on child porn filters , no one 's ever going to defend people who watch child porn . 
  finland implemented child porn filter in 2008 , and it has been [ far from success . 
  ] ( http://lapsiporno.info/english-2008-02-15.html ) for those not reading the link : - less than 1 % of blocked sites are child porn . 
  - the police chooses without any other control what goes to the list and what does n't . 
  - getting your site off the list is nearly impossible . 
  - police have blocked access to the linked site which is critique of the filter . 
  i 'm not equating the two , i 'm just making a point about arguments you keep using !, 
   people do chose to watch explicit content . 
  so you feel that the people do n't have the right to not end on a list without resorting to vpns and such . 
  why did n't you say it in the first place , we could 've just avoided the whole argument about the right on privacy on their own internet connection . 
   to compare a porn filter that can be switched on or off to racial segregation is incredibly distasteful and shows a lack of respect and quite frankly , ignorance . 
  what on earth ? 
  racial segregation was immensely more dreadful than any porn filter .
