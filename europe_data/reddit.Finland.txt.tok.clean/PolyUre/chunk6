  see what i did there ? 
  compared the two , ** again . 
  **  black people could n't simply choose to sit at the front of the bus . 
  and people willing to watch blocked content ca n't choose * not to be on a list * of people who want the possibility to view `` extreme pornography . '', 
   this is something that is already standard on mobile phones but nobody is complaining about `` muh rights '' there . 
  the blocking on mobiles is just as problematic , but is mainly seen as lost battle , since it 's already implemented . 
  you can not dismiss controversial issues just by saying that they are n't , even if many people just do n't care . 
  similar to `` just sit on the back of the bus '' was n't an answer to racial segregation . 
   that 's not even a comparable case . 
  the paedos have n't been passing laws or influencing government in a way that allows their friends to fuck children . 
  the mp 's power is n't only legislative one , they have used their influence to halt or misdirect ongoing police investigations . 
   pretty much the entire rest of the government is insistent that the cps investigates and stamps out the paedo network . 
  well imagine what kind of reaction there would be , if they would n't ? 
  situation has progressed beyond their control , they are now in damage control mode . 
  they have accepted that their friends ' heads might roll and try to make best by calling investigation . 
  it 's not like they could n't have called for investigation earlier , as the abuses have gone on only for few centuries . 
  would you be comfortable on the thought that over two and a half percent of all mps took bribes from foreign governments ? 
  the public outcry is n't so much about the pure numbers , it 's the covering up . 
  on a principle we are n't in a disagreement . 
  as we have seen , labeling all mps as paedophiles just gets people unnecessarily defensive whereas i think everybody is in agreement that child abuse is bad and should be stopped . 
  the number of abusers as such is irrelevant , the main point of outrage is the covering up , which has been effective and continous . 
  these people have held positions of civic trust and abused that trust . 
  now that they have lost that trust ( as a group , since the people responsible have n't been ousted ) , it 's easy to see why there is a feeling that they are not fit to make a ruling on controversial subject such as the porn filter . 
  it would take a special kind of stupid politician not to call them now that the cat is out of the bag , no ? 
  and those who have abused children ** and ** voted for porn filter , they are n't hypocrites , they are just bad people . 
  as per your earlier message , you asked for `` those currently in power '' and `` any sources '' , both of which my message answers ? 
  current mps are n't named , but it 's quite alarming if [ up to 40 mps or peers ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10947561/more-than-10-politicians-on-list-held-by-police-investigating-westminster-paedophile-ring.html ) at least knew about it . 
  of course they could , but why would they , if the people accept it the other way ? 
   the slight issues with it are that it 's on by default . 
  some other slight issues might be a ) isps not telling what they are blocking and b ) overblocking of content that 's not even pornographic . 
  not to mention the ease of taking the blocking further when the infrastructure is already in place . 
  pope falls in to the category `` or similar '' . 
  the other card is from my parents , who are n't part of this boob-postcard-group . 
  it 's a postcard from a mate . 
  we have these unwritten rules that if you ca n't find a postcard with boobs , then you must send one with local royal family or similar . 
  i do n't collect magnets from different countries , but from old hard drives . 
  [ here 's my fridge . 
  i thought \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 would be in the list . 
  how common is it ? 
  are you honestly suggesting rekorderlig or kopparberg over strongbow ? 
  i 'm not saying strongbow is near the best there is , but rekorderlig and kopparberg are at least in finland overtly sweet juices made for teenagers . 
  what do you mean , `` if true '' ? 
  there are some explaining factors such that criminal gangs come over to burglarize or steal cars , and due to ease of access can often get back with the goods before police can start to do anything . 
  that also explains why russians are under-represented : they must go through much stricter control to get back . 
  somalis on the other hand often do different kind of crimes . 
  estonian in this context means estonian citizen . 
  finnish authorities do not make any assumptions on any ethnicities . 
  i made you table for comparing ten biggest foreign populations and their share of the foreign prison population . 
  nationality | percentage of foreign population | percentage of foreign prison population : -- | : -- | : -- estonia | 22,0 | 25,7 russia | 13,9 | 9,3 sweden | 3,8 | 2,1 china | 3,4 | 0 somalia | 3,4 | 3,9 thailand | 3,1 | 0,4 iraq | 3,1 | 3,3 india | 2,2 | 0,2 turkey | 2,1 | 0,4 great britain | 2,0 | 1,0, 
  foreign prisoners are prisoners who are not finnish citizens . 
  as for the per capita numbers , estonians are a bit overrepresented in our foreign prison population , as they account for 22 % of all foreign nationals . 
  [ statistics of the criminal sanctions agency 2014 ] ( http://www.rikosseuraamus.fi/material/attachments/rise/julkaisut-tilastollinenvuosikirja/bcnzcz22h/statistical_yearbook_2014_of_the_criminal_sanctions_agency.pdf ) , page 32 table 20 . 
  125 of the 486 foreign prisoners are estonian , that 's 25,7 % . 
  well , over a quarter of the finnish foreign prison population is from estonia . 
  well , she `` has a right and a duty to express her views on government matters '' , and the meetings are strictly confidential , so we 'll never know !, 
  \\  apolitical \\  meets weekly with the pm . 
  no , he was talking about conscription , which includes civilian service . 
   there is no `` work '' included . 
  you do n't consider civilian service work ? 
  well , we did n't have any problems with the police in warsaw while drinking in the parks , but i do n't know whether this was due the paper bag or not . 
  locals adviced us to just bring a paper bag . 
  av is for single-seat constituencies , stv for multi-seat . 
  why mmp instead of , say , stv ? 
   like invade a neighbouring country and annex some of its territory ? 
  well that did n't do the trick during 2008 georgian war . 
   spanking or smacking is legal , but it must not leave a mark on the body beat them on the soles of the feet , does n't leave any marks , but hurts like hell !, 
  finland sent in addition to h\u00e4meenmaa three watercat m18 amcs . 
  securing an access to kaliningrad and making sure that the gulf of finland can not be closed with sea mines in cooperation with estonia . 
  seeing that estonia is in the nato , finland seems the likelier target for an invasion , albeit not highly likely still . 
   in finnish white bread is vehn\u00e4leip\u00e4 ( wheat bread ) . 
  now now , vaalea leip\u00e4 ( light/blond bread ) can be made from barley too . 
  no \u00e4 or \u00f6 . 
  they are , and have been , a real band on their own , so i do n't see the executive meddling . 
  to people not digging pkn 's performance : do you otherwise like punk and this is just a bad punk song , or do n't you like it just because it 's punk ? 
  kuka on pasi nurmi ? 
  i 'd add benjamin britten on that list . 
   i attest a superior understanding of how letters are actually pronounced . 
  quick , how to pronounce d in bad ? 
  if they 'd pay for it themselves , but now cities pay disproportionate amounts to offer them services . 
  i 'd say it 's a four way tie with the marseillaise , non je ne regrette rien , moi ... lolita and amelie theme . 
  behind them tu es foutu . 
  truly the [ best part ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/4360569513.png ) of dorm life . 
  everything north from [ uusimaa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uusimaa ) can be given to sweden . 
  well , you are defending the current practice , and i did n't want to read too much into it , but i guess i have to acknowledge that economics is n't your forte . 
   that `` those budgets '' give people a job designing , repairing , developing , producing and maintainting ships , vehicles , aircrafts and other things . 
  that soldiers and officers are paid an income they sustain a family with - - are you suggesting that those people would n't do something more economically productive in case there would n't be a need for massive military investments ? 
   there 's only so much power you can give to an unelected house . 
  like , none ? 
  finland too , surely ? 
   is `` quite a lot '' about 90-95 % of the school ? 
  no , of course not , our immigrants are n't concentrated in same areas in such numbers . 
  i 'd also wager that a school that has 90 % of its students from immigrant background is n't about integrating . 
  of course immigrants will be by themselves if there is hardly anyone else !, 
  i went to primary school on a city district with the biggest ratio of immigrants . 
  we had quite a lot of kurds , somalis , vietnamese , and other ethnicities , which all spoke finnish , and interacted with the ethnic finns too . 
   are you going to send them / sending them to `` poorly performing '' schools so the students there can see how normal swedes act and study ? 
  we do n't have a custom of sending kids to any school . 
  most likely they go to the closest one . 
  that shooting range behaviour gave me cancer . 
  interesting to note that finland and germany , who were not allies , give more credit to the soviets than others .
