   it comes in a variety of ` stars ' defining how much brandy is in it . 
  the one star as shown above is the best because you do n't notice the revolting taste of the ghastly brandy they use so much . 
  one star is good booze , three stars is bad cognac . 
  well , everybody knows breakfast is the most important beer of the day . 
   what you 're advocating is basically abandoning everything but the southern coast . 
  i find this very rude . 
  well it 's the de facto course of action during military conflict . 
  did n't sarkozy have an affair with anne fulda ? 
  i think in some countries it 's even a requirement . 
  for example in france i think de gaulle was the last president without a mistress . 
  first thing that got to mind was retuper\u00e4n wbks version of [ vivaldi 's spring ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh-nhve1x40 ) .

  i do n't think the sense of superiority has to be based on the reality . 
  it only needs to be managed by the nordic sense of superiority . 
  motto could be something along the lines `` our way is better . '', 
  no wonder the word came to mind . 
  maybe magnetic could work ? 
  [ there you go . 
  probably something modern like radio . 
  i thought that suolakurkku is a gherkin and maustekurkku is a pickle ? 
  come on , you guys are giving the impression that * lagom * is something quintessentially swedish !, 
  you are also stuck with the house if the value drops suddenly and you are not willing / able to take the loss . 
  is * that * your vision of a b\u00e4ttre folk name ? 
  [ almost , but not quite . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pes%c3%a4pallo ), 
  true . 
  hockey , football , floorball , volleyball , pes\u00e4pallo , basketball , rink bandy , and futsal are all more popular than bandy . 
  not to mention that finnish numbers include police killing wounded animals .

   you realize that people with master in physics needs a preeetty good understanding of maths right ? 
  pfft . 
  mathematics for a physicist is a lot like eyebrows . 
  not any actual use , but if you take them away , it 'll look quite odd . 
  mainly in the 60s and the 70s . 
  some are a bit younger though . 
  none taken , those are hideous . 
  on the other hand finns use a term * piruntorjuntabunkkeri * ( anti devil bunker ) for churches , and it sure is fitting . 
  it 's [ lauritsala church . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lauritsala_church ) some say that the basis of the design is an equilateral triangle symbolising the holy trinity , but in reality it 's modelled after a half pipe .

  there was a newer plant closer to the hardest hit part of the japanese coast which did n't have problems with the tsunami . 
  reluctance to invest in the new plants is the direct reason why older , and hence unsafer , are still used . 
  nokia had touch screen technology in 2004 , over three years before iphone , but middle management deemed it `` not useful '' and `` not fluent to use '' and shot it down instead of improving it .

  estonians in tallinn used to watch finnish television when under soviet rule . 
  these people in addition to very tallinn based travel give the impression that estonians understand finnish quite well . 
   they did n't even do that to spies in the cold war foreign spies were used to exchange own captured spies , however some [ american citizens spying for soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julius_and_ethel_rosenberg ) were executed when charged with federal crimes . 
   it\u00e4valta ( austria ) = east power it 's quite literal translation from \u00d6sterreich . 
   every single day , she would cross the bike lane and stand exactly where the bus doors would land . 
  it was crazy . 
  first i thought it was just pure luck , but then i started to notice she would n't be standing at the same place every time , yet the bus doors would come to her as she knew , and i was so confused how she could know , but she did . 
  with these easy steps you can make the bus stop where you want : - wave clearly to the driver and try to make more effort than the other people waiting for the bus . 
  still , be careful not to go full-on nazi salute mode . 
  - this is important : make an eye contact with the driver . 
  stare into his soul and assert dominance , you are the most important person to hop on on this stop . 
  make him know it . 
  - if there are several buses present , use your situational awareness and approximate which bus goes where , then stand in that slot . 
  congratulations , 99 % of the time , the driver will stop next to you . 
  using 2d objects for imaging is altogether a bad idea , since humans are naturally quite bad on comparing areas . 
  tartu has loads of university students and great bars . 
  p\u00e4rnu has spa-going pensioners . 
  well , they asked for offensive !, 
  a finn , a swede and a norwegian went to an island . 
  norwegian shot everyone . 
  jam is the generic term in british english and translates roughly to ` hillo ' , whereas marmalade is marmeladi . 
  american english uses jelly instead of jam . 
   \\ - - has too much marmelade . 
  jam . 
  one does not put marmalade on joulutorttus . 
  i 'd wager that the euros equal percents and the other numbers are expected number of mps . 
   do parents not hit children at all for disciplinary reasons ? 
  some do , but it 's illegal and is mainly scorned upon . 
  mainly the argument is ' i was beat as a kid and i turned all right ! ', 
  i could talk to you about consent and all that jazz , but it might be too difficult of a consept to you . 
  luckily i live in a country where hitting people , children or not , is illegal . 
  top tip to all british : slap them on the soles of their feet . 
  hurts quite a lot , but does n't leave a mark . 
  if russia wants to keep the control of kaliningrad when push comes to shove , it needs to acquire land connection via baltics or secure access to baltic sea by seizing finnish coast , \u00c5land , gotland , and maybe bornholm . 
  well that 's our bible belt . 
  and practically arctic .
