  no no , belgium 's score is always ( netherlands ' score + france 's score ) / 2, 
  ha ha !, 
  suck it , sweden . 
  vappu 's popularity depends a bit on your studies ( and whether you still study or not ) , but on general i agree with your list . 
  is n't agriculture maanviljely and ( animal ) husbandry karjatalous ? 
   either some less well off people are going to lose out , or you 're going to need to raise taxes , that 's a fact . 
  if the tax raise is smaller or equal to the 800 $ per month , where 's the problem ? 
  meanwhile those in the weakest position get better and more surefire benefits that do n't disallow them from taking part on the job market . 
  it 's quite difficult to sing . 
  i 'd rather not see an arena full of hockey fans trying to sing it during the world championships . 
  i thought that estonians called finns ` poro ' ? 
  most likely will be implemented with negative income tax , which artificially increases the revenue . 
  the revenue does n't have anything to do whether if it 's affordable or not .

   so the fact that `` kuusi palaa '' has what 9 different meanings does n't inherently make the language more difficult to learn ? 
  homophones are n't really something unique to finnish . 
  finland 's poorest municipality is [ kivij\u00e4rvi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kivij%c3%a4rvi ) , home to 1200 people with median income of 18 500 $ . 
  it 's mainly full of lakes and forests . 
  during summers its population triples due to people getting to their summer cottages . 
  poorest municipality that also has a city designation is [ nurmes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nurmes ) , home to some 8000 people with median income of 20 000 $ .

  this is what my russian teacher told too . 
  during the finnish civil war in 1918 both sides [ committed acts of terror .

  yes , and norja means flexible . 
  also norja ( norway ) , saksa ( germany ) , nevalainen ( after river neva ) and lappalainen ( lappish ) . 
  in finland ein fall f\u00fcr zwei and der alte have been popular for ages . 
  also marienhof !, 
  in addition to that , \u00e4 and \u00f6 are independent letters in finnish , not a and o with trema . 
  yellow face is implied , we are talking about finns after all . 
  i thought that academic quarter was quite common . 
  but cum tempore gives hint that you are talking about germany ? 
  copious amounts of alcohol . 
  well , in finland 's case the saying has at least in some point of history been close to truth . 
   you 've heard of that thing where japanese tourists get ill from how beautiful paris is ? 
  [ they get ill for quite the opposite reasons ] ( https://youtu.be/ukhgi_-tcmu ), 
  it says that the graphic considers greater helsinki region as helsinki , so it might be something else . 
  otherwise i would have guessed grani . 
  [ in more detail . 
  what would the swedes get from such a pact ? 
  it 's not like finland is gon na pack its bags and leave sweden open for an attack . 
  the same tactic has been used [ for ages .

  the estonian anthem has a really nice melody . 
  on a more serious note : la marseillaise . 
   as it stands , russia does n't have any strategic reasons to invade finland . 
  let 's go with your scenario . 
  russia has to secure its access to kaliningrad and to make sure that gulf of finland can not be closed with sea mines . 
  you do n't see invasion as a reasonable threat in this scenario ? 
   there are fewer yellow and red cards called in the mls . 
  this does not mean that there is less embellishment , but i 'd still like to see numbers . 
   we do n't get as much non sense embellishment in the mls than other leagues dude ... 
  okay , at first i thought br\u00e4nnboll was what you call sp\u00f6kboll , since it 's polttopallo ( burnball ) in finnish . 
   what party afterwards is called ? 
  reception . 
  yeah , only finns can insult our shitty `` national '' `` sport '' !, 
  oh they actually play pes\u00e4pallo . 
  i thought they just agreed on the scoreline and went home . 
   that 's laponia for you .

  [ 2008 winner ] ( http://www.vuodenluontokuva.fi/vlk/2008 ) is my favourite . 
  it captures the finnish autumn perfectly . 
  but which is bigger , islam or an xbox ? 
  of course you ca n't , it 's haram . 
   the proof is that the amount is too large for any single person to consume before the alcohol expires . 
  then it expires . 
  that 's still not illegal . 
  [ it 's not about who wins , but who loses . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbvbqpq4lxk ), 
  sure . 
  or could just write 3600 l = 3 600 000 ml , no need for multiplication . 
   3,600 l * 1000 ml = 3,600,000 ml of vodka now now , 3600 l * 1 l = 3600 l ^ 2, 
  i 'd like to see the government relax their attitude on alcohol as a whole so people would n't have the need for hoarding the cheap booze and paying taxes to estonia instead of finland . 
  the current system promotes arbitraryness and grants customs powers it 's not supposed to have . 
  i see where you are coming from , but i disagree . 
  it can indicate such things , but i 'd rather see customs present some hard evidence on the matter . 
  nothing is forbidding him from buying more than he can consume . 
  yup . 
  finnish customs and courts make the defendant prove that the alcohol is for personal use instead of them providing proof that there is an intent to sell . 
  why that amount has to be consumed during one year ? 
  your finland proper url is n't working . 
  needs an additional closing parethesis and \\ as an escape character . 
  like this : \\ [ finland-proper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_proper_ ( historical_province \\ ) ), 
  so send them to those institutions that can handle them ? 
  or are you suggesting sending criminally insane to normal prisons just because the us does n't have appropriate facilities for their treatment ? 
  you know , mental institutions ? 
  why on earth would you send criminally insane felons to prison ? 
  kind of , we have [ national defence training association ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_defence_training_association_of_finland ) and [ local defence troops . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/local_defence_troops_ ( finland \\ ) ), 
  they make smashing whisky . 
  yeah . 
  understood that you meant that no monarch since charles i claimed ruling by divine right . 
  the point is exactly that the gulf of finland is quite easy to close with mines and patrols . 
  compared to the situation that russia has taken control of finland and can fire anti-ship missiles from \u00c5land , it 's a lot easier to keep kaliningrad supplied with ships .
