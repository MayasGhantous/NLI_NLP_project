  or even stockholm or tallinn . 
  helsinki is a lovely town if you just take it for what it is , if you sit in in the parks , enjoying never-ending evenings , drinking a few cold ones and just soaking it in . 
  taking your time walking around , relaxing and avoiding any ` activities ' . 
  maybe see if you can head out to a summer cottage . 
  but as a touristy destination where you have things to see and do , i could see finland as extremely underwhelming . 
  perhaps the reindeer safaris of lapland might be exotic enough to entice some people ? 
  i do n't know if you read the article , but no . 
  finland has plenty of people with nationality-based last names , such as * suomalainen , virolainen , ruotsalainen , ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen * . 
  that 's why you dig a [ huge tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository ) . 
  not so much liars , just massively incompetent . 
  when most of your party is made of village idiots , it 's no surprise they are n't very good lawmakers . 
  also , they have faced the eternal problem of populist opposition parties : once you get some actual political power , you quickly realize you need to do a lot of compromises . 
  it 's easier to promise big changes when you have no responsibilities . 
  population level happiness and suicide rates do n't necessarily correlate . 
  also , the scoring counts in many factors , not just a survey of `` how happy are you today ? '', 
  finland might not be the chirpiest nation on earth , but it has done a decent job of reducing outright misery . 
  at least in finland , about one fifth of houses of houses are heated with electricity . 
  more or less half are connected to district heating network and the rest get their warmth from burning something . 
  to a certain degree , perhaps . 
  the biggest punishment is the lost freedom , but prison sentences are n't supposed to be some revenge by society . 
  the idea is to take harmful individuals off the streets and try to rehabilitate them . 
  it should be unpleasant to the point that you do n't prefer prison life to freedom , but beyond that , there 's no sense in degrading the inmates . 
  the goal is to make them productive citizens once again . 
  for all you dank memers out there : this pic was taken pretty much from where [ darude is sitting ] ( http://www.oystermag.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/article-image-650x580/images/sandstorm.jpg ) . 
  about russia , the site claims :  it is illegal to drive a dirty car ; keep licence plates free of mud otherwise you could be subject to a fine ranging from r. 800 to r. 2,000 . 
  i wonder how big chunck of the gdp those fines are , as i 'm not sure i 've ever seen a clean russian car . 
  i have a licence to operate a bmp-2 in lakes . 
  i wonder if it 's valid abroad . 
  it 's not really that big of an army . 
  if the countries in the middle east really wanted to bury them , it should n't be a problem . 
  i think it was bill maher who asked why the west should send anyone to fight isis , when the surrounding states have over five millions soldiers in their armies . 
  then again , i guess many regimes do n't really mind isis causing chaos as long as they are contained in their current dwellings . 
  yeah , that sounds [ perfectly normal ] ( https://youtu.be/ntjyt-6hjqw ) . 
   plenty of countries have extreme right parties with candidates running for public office regularly . 
  but fringe parties tend to stay on the fringe . 
  parties who openly flirt with nazism rarely get that wide of a support . 
  8 % means that they are a legitimate minority party , not just some rambling idiot and his 13 followers . 
  are they nazis celebrating the victory over nazism ? 
  are they mourning ? 
  what 's happening ? 
  never been attacked . 
  here in finland , the canadian geese spend all their waking hours covering every last square metre of park lawns with their crap . 
  the summer is short , there 's no time to attack . 
  i feel bad for the [ bagged geese ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mari5-1200.jpg ) . 
  it 's a [ small chapel ] ( http://hs13.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/1920/1305580670763?ts=314 ) . 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( https://monnakaijomaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_20150320_154104.jpg ), 
  and so forth . 
  of course it was . 
  paying high wages like that led to billions in cost overruns . 
  that 's preposterous . 
  at least the polish lads building nuclear power plant in finland got paid two euros per hour . 
  well , in many languages , * hummer * means * lobster * . 
  i think they just want to get back to water . 
  finland has the troops to throw into the meat grinder , but sweden could provide a lot of material help . 
  they 've got a superior air force and navy . 
  also tanks and missiles . 
  those are tall ferns we buy from russia . 
  i remember hearing a story about how the finnish navy flagship * [ pohjanmaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_minelayer_pohjanmaa ) * participated in some big navy gathering and people mistook it for an escort ship , asking when the flagship would arrive . 
  do n't know if it 's a true story , but the finnish navy is n't exactly one to rule the oceans . 
  [ bus stop in finland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/bus_stop_shelter.wind-_mill.jalasjarvi.20070703.ojp.jpg ) . 
  i think the first signs of agriculture in finland are from around 4000 years ago , so it 's not a new fad . 
  but hunting and gathering definitely supplemented farming . 
  and the sami have never been big farmers . 
  but since the soil is so poor , slash-and-burn agriculture was the preferred way of growing food . 
  that required farmers to move around every few years , really limiting any big permanent population centers . 
  ultimately , it leads to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bctpud5.jpg ) . 
  are we to understand that the polar night has rendered the word ` light ' unnecessary for the sami ? 
  edit . 
  apparently it 's ' \u010duovga ' in northern sami . 
  some austrian is not going to like this . 
  i quite like [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/uvfo4i2p1m8 ) as it has random 5 seconds of slalom . 
  it 's not really a choice . 
  since , you know , conscription . 
  well , it has n't been * that * long ago when you had to do your own taxes in finland . 
  i think the current model was adopted in the late 90 's . 
  in finland , they send you a letter with your taxes done and you only need to respond if you want something changed . 
  hey now , croatia is n't the only one with [ beautiful waterfronts ] ( http://trombit.net/testi_2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/heikkoj%c3%a4%c3%a41.jpg ) . 
  croatia : cheap , warm , mediterrannean . 
  finland : dark , expensive , [ kouvola ] ( http://www.seuraavanakouvola.fi/wp-content/gallery/loytis/kouvola2_panorama1p.jpg ) . 
  it really is a tough choice . 
  that seems a bit suspicious . 
  like , i wonder what sort of infrastructure projects did strasbourg do in order to move from unranked to fourth in two short years ? 
  it 's a * notable * improvement . 
  do not despair , it 's still legal in finland !, 
  i know very little about andorra and liechtenstein . 
  hilti tools come from liechtenstein , that 's about it . 
  and i 'm not an expert on malta either . 
  i know it 's a nice little island that sends fat ladies to eurovision to sing grandiose ballads . 
  and those ladies had a real advantage as they were allowed to sing in english . 
  i know the name of their capital city and that they are eager to host your shady severs , but beyond that ... 
  nice to see . 
  it took decades to [ expand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a4nsimetro ) the tiny helsinki metro with even a few additional stops . 
  and the residents of espoo ( where the metro will now go ) protested all the way . 
  they fear that the unwashed masses of eastern helsinki will now reach their precious garden villages . 
  the stations are something else : http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/oct/31/moscows-metro-stations-in-pictures, 
  finland probably had no need for the word before the swedish rule . 
  and since it 's a title , it 's quite natural to borrow it . 
  no i agree , ovechkin seems like a nice guy . 
  but he has a history of quite fervent patriotism .
