  like [ posting on instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/sptmi8bola/?modal=true ) a clear support for russian actions in ukraine , * `` save children from fascism '' * . 
  that 's really nothing new . 
  russian athletes seem to be very patriotic and supportive of putin . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c578jci.jpg ) ovechkin in his putin shirt ( superme commander ? ), 
  and [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1drq1z1.jpg ) well-known wife-batterer varlamov declaring crimea to be a part of russia . 
  no , [ this ] ( http://moro.aamulehti.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/20150116_132821_resized.jpg ) is winter in finland . 
  thanks , that was amazing !, 
  also , i really hope that boat was called montana . 
  how can finland be below average ? 
  * we eat nothing but potatoes !, 
  * is it because we make our booze from grains ? 
  quite remarkable [ eyebrows ] ( http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_06/1413651/x_lon_studart_160211_c477d2fe26fa9bc900ce8a5c6af65d60.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg ) . 
  i think it comes from pitbull . 
  i do n't know how much metal rods ` leak ' . 
  and anyways , it 's over 400 meters deep , far below any soil . 
  i wonder why the new cement is so vital . 
  finland is already digging its [ repository ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository ) and there does n't seem to be any need for ` revolutionary cement ' . 
  just bury the rods deep in the bedrock and fill up the tunnel . 
  in the picture , poland 's biggest export , * puolapuut * . 
   what 's not to like ? 
  i guess human rights and freedom of speech ? 
  well , the report seems to show uk being the second and third worst when it comes to metrics of economic inequality . 
  i 'd assume most people are angry about those and are n't as concerned about * digital access * . 
  in your face norway !, 
  with your plentiful natural resources , beautiful fjords and fit people . 
  and horrible gender equality . 
  finland has a lot of middle-aged alcoholics stabbing each other after petty arguments . 
  in other demographics , our homicide rate is comparable to western europe . 
  russia produces some truly exciting hockey players . 
  a * panarin-kuznetsov-tarasenko * line , holy shit !, 
   those f-16s are more advanced and reliable than any other russian jet that exists right now . 
  there are no grounds to make such a claim . 
  and the huge difference in numbers alone suggests that your original claim that turkish airforce would overpower their russian counterpart does n't seem to have any evidence behind it . 
  turkey has couple hundred f-16 's , a jet from the 70 's . 
  i do n't know why only planes built after the fall of soviet union count for russia . 
  russia has hundreds of comparable or superior aircraft ( 250 mig-29 's , 130 mig-31 's , 320 su-27 's , 40 su-35 's ) . 
  also , several f-16 's were shot down in gulf war with russian-built missiles and fighter jets , so they are not exactly immune . 
  as are guardian and reuters ? 
   5 of these russian jets were shot down in the war against tiny georgia . 
  against turkish f-16d they will be sitting ducks . 
  you do n't know much about airplanes , do you ? 
  russia would not be sending su-25 's to fight turkish f-16 , rather some real fighter jets . 
  www.globalresearch.ca/is-turkey-collaborating-with-the-islamic-state-isis/5491516 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/turkey-cut-islamic-state-supply-lines-erdogan-isis http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-arms-iduskbn0o61l220150521, 
  turkey can both give weapons to isis and protect its own borders if they come too close . 
  hot news from 2011 . 
  and russian hardware is mainly rotting in some warehouse . 
  sure , they 've got all these fancy new tanks and planes on display , but the army does n't have money to purchase more than handful of them . 
   how do we know a bunch of finnish conscripts would be good for anything but presenting a target-rich environment for russian drone pilots ? 
  a million armed men making loud bangs is infinitely better than a token force of 30 000 professional soldiers . 
  and the russians are conscripts too . 
  i do n't know why you have this notion that the finnish army is a bunch of untrained idiots while all the russians are part fo the spetsnaz . 
  i wonder what all the chechen rebels feel like when their leader is moscow 's no. 1 cheerleader . 
  i 'd like to point out that wikipedia has a pic of [ kadyrov ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/ramzan_kadyrov_portrait.png ) and his [ dad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/akhmad_kadyrov.jpg ) . 
  an american woman living in finland wrote about her [ sauna experiences ] ( http://suddenlyseekingsuomi.com/2015/09/28/saunanjalkeinen-post-sauna/ ) :  i need to say something here about being naked in public . 
  in the u.s. , i have visited many public baths ( as i mentioned at the beginning of this post ) , and all of them are clothing optional , which means that people do n't wear anything . 
  but there is something about the finnish sauna culture that speaks to my earlier comment about the difference between appreciating a ritual and having intrinsic knowledge of that ritual . 
  i now realize that in the u.s. , people being naked -- even when everyone is naked and that 's the expected protocol -- still has that sort of `` we 're all naked and we know it and we do n't care but we 're still aware that we 're all naked '' thing going on . 
  people being naked here in finland , however , just is . 
  and not only is there an obvious comfort , there 's a pride in it , i mean , in the way that people carry themselves . 
  or maybe it 's just so awesome to be surrounded by women of all ages giving zero v *** ut about what anyone might think of them -- because no one is thinking , everyone is just being . 
  i have never sensed such an absolute lack of self-consciousness in a room full of naked women as i have in these finnish saunas . 
  you have to pay it yourself . 
  and since the state is n't setting the prices , the colleges can demand more and more . 
  what are the kids going to do , not get an education ? 
   tupac kill 6 million alban pigeons no scope making gold, 
  yes we do . 
  but that particular commentator also seems to like the czech and slovak teams . 
  as a supposed ` neutral ' , [ him doing a slovakia-canada game ] ( https://youtu.be/vtdu8en6wag ) , where he 's pretty openly disappointed every time canada scores . 
  well , [ here you go ] ( http://hs13.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/960/1434514764301?ts=25 ) . 
  but it 's embarrasing to touch each other 's balls when there are women around . 
  [ the finnish girl ] ( http://1.standaardcdn.be/assets/images_upload/2016/01/29/fraude1.jpg ) does n't seem to fit in with the rest of the lot . 
  russia is also habitually concerned by the human rights in finland . 
  especially when they learn about how finnish authorities are instructed to take babies away from russian mothers . 
  or some such thing . 
  it tends to vary . 
  what about the danish classic , [ gayniggers from outer space ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gayniggers_from_outer_space ) ? 
  lions were very popular in european heraldry in the middle ages . 
  it comes from there . 
  we can [ do the alps too ] ( https://youtu.be/pkztrwqs6zw?t=1m33s ) !, 
  depressed potato in the middle . 
  i like it !, 
  you trying to [ out-weird us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhreqkrvone ) ? 
  not sure if that is real or just an elf village from some tolkien movie . 
  i 'm sure * all * french film critics would agree that l\u00e9on is the best film france has ever produced . 
  also , the intouchables has the same imdb score . 
  i mean , i 'm happy to concede to russians and moldovans ( well done chaps ) , but grenada ? 
  we 're losing to grenada ? 
  yay , we are number two !, 
  we 're slowly recovering from that time our then prime minister received a stack of wooden planks , maybe illegally . 
  i assume the corrupt norwegians would suggest this index is corrupted . 
  well , there are the usual driving lessons ( 18 hours according to wikipedia ) , the theoretical exam and the drivering exam . 
  but there 's also the [ slippery driving course ] ( http://www.porvoonrata.fi/images/dsc00240.jpg ) where you learn about difficult circumstances , emergency braking , dodging obstacles and such . 
  and then there 's a separate driving lesson done during darkness , how to handle your lights and such . 
  i do n't know if anything is banned in finland , apart from drugs , but tobacco and alcohol are highly taxed . 
  there is also a tax on certain sugary products , such as ice cream , sweets and sodas . 
  light sodas are cheaper than regular sugared versions . 
  because of eu pressure , that tax will expire in 2017 , except for sodas . 
  but the claim that * ` russia can do nothing ' * to solve this situation is dishonest at best . 
   there is currently nothing russia or rebels can do . 
  nothing ?
