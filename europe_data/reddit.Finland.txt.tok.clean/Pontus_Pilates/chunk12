  really ? 
  what if : 1 ) russia withdraws from ukraine ( including crimea ) 2 ) the rebels lay down their guns and aknowledge the kiev government as the legitimate central power of ukraine that would solve most of the problems . 
  yeah , most of the stuff described does n't seem too foreign in finland , apart from the voting . 
  and we also have to go through banks to tell the government it 's really us . 
  but i guess it 's just more streamlined and overall a good story . 
   each id-card has a chip that has two `` keys '' -- one allows you to sign documents , and the other -- to login to the governmental websites . 
  to do this , a citizen should insert the card into a special reader and connect it to their computers . 
  with the proliferation of smartphones and mobile internet , cards are now integrated into the sim-card . 
  can you buy sim cards without such identifications ? 
  i 'm just asking for when i 'll move to estonia and become a amphetamine dealer . 
  that 's often what happens when the opposition gets into power . 
  it 's easy to demand radical solutions when you do n't have to make decisions yourself . 
  when you get elected , you come into contact with existing power structures and political realities and realize that your ideas might be pretty impossible to implement . 
  happened in finland as well . 
  we have a euroskeptic party called * perussuomalaiset * , consisting of their charismatic leader timo soini and a bunch of village idiots . 
  soini spent years ridiculing the government and the people loved him . 
  well , last year his party got the second most seats and went on to form a coalition government . 
  turns out , it 's not as fun when you have resposibilities . 
  and soini , he became the minister of foreign affairs and has to work with other european ministers . 
  he ca n't really bash eu at every turn anymore . 
  i 'm sure tsirpas was sincere about his political ideas , but found out pretty quickly that the greek economy ca n't survive if he just flips his middle finger to the international banking institutions . 
  as for the finnnish village idiots , surprisingly , they are not very good lawmakers . 
  cannabis has no real history in finland . 
  finns are drinkers . 
  and the drug of choise is amphetamine . 
  i do n't know how much it is inspired by the german supply of pervitin , or methamphetamine , during wwii . 
  it has become more popular or the last decade , especially the national team . 
  but it does n't necessarily translate to much bigger audiences for the domestic league . 
  it 's still far behind hockey in terms attendance and media attention . 
  in finland , it 's mostly popular with the swedish speaking community . 
  not very big among the general public and ca n't compete with basketball , volleyball or * pes\u00e4pallo * , not to mention hockey or football . 
  the most notable thing about finnish handball are the occasional matches between [ cocks and dicken ] ( http://cdn02.nyheter24.se/6c0b67da0702021d01000000000f020101/2014/05/09/953185/sk%c3%a4rmavbild%202014-05-09%20kl.%2010.58.35.png ) . 
  even the national broadcaster is in the joke : [ cocks pysyi kovana finaalissa ] ( http://yle.fi/urheilu/cocks_pysyi_kovana_cupin_finaalissa__dicken_taipui/6432382 ) , * cocks stayed hard in the final * . 
  that 's not a very scientific way to rank countries . 
  it 's a survey , not based on real metrics . 
  one factor in the best country ranking is :  adventure ( 3.24 percent ) : friendly , fun , pleasant climate , scenic , sexy, 
  the mannerheim cases were n't necessarily satire . 
  and they were very much allowed . 
  tabloids just went looking for people who were upset and wrote how the people are * angry * . 
  that 's the comedian from the often posted video where three muslim girls try to shame him for making fun of religion . 
  is he a big name in netherlands ? 
  thanks , great pictures . 
  that does look pretty run down , but also , if the trash was collected , potholes filled and everything was n't so muddy , most of those places could be fairly nice . 
  i did have some favorites , such as the `` my life my rules '' car , the random limousine and the trunk filled with some unidentified animals . 
  the [ kouvola colouring book ] ( http://doge.naurunappula.com/screen/57/8c/578c0616468fd7be/0/1205536.jpg ) . 
  sure , but why ? 
  are the so many other finlands ( or ffindirs ) in the welsh language that they need to denote this as * the * finland . 
  dr. alban is misspelled . 
  also , why does finland have a random y in fron of it ? 
   that does n't make flying spaghetti monster any less real than allah . 
  yeah , and that is some high school level atheism . 
  but i assume you can recognize the difference between a religion with a billion followers and an internet joke . 
  religion as a phenomenon is n't limited to the question ` is god real ' . 
  there are plenty of jews who do n't believe in god , yet find value in their religious traditions . 
  if you yourself find pastafarianism to be a valuable force in your life , be my guest . 
  i guess these are the secret hidden gems of europe if you 've only ever heard of paris . 
  well , people actually believe in allah and the teachings of koran . 
  nobody believes the flying spaghetti monster is real . 
  finland has been slipping ever since our prime minister received a stack of wood planks he did n't pay for . 
  i just ca n't muster much anger if a certain religious groups can wear a hat in a photograph . 
  well , i do n't actually care . 
  i thought it was fairly amusing when the austrian guy did this strainer thing years ago , but i can equally appreciate the russian response . 
  tapio , the god of forests . 
   what defines a genuine religion ? 
  i guess there is n't a hard definition . 
  a good first step might be if somebody was serious in their belief . 
  i fully support this . 
  if you want to bother the authorities with your fake religion , it 's only right the authorities will expect you to stand by your convictions . 
  which dialect suits best for making lewd comments towards young girls while revving your vespa ? 
  next , russia will launch an investigation into american meddling in eu . 
   in finland gypsies seem to love romance , slavic and english-language names . 
  and all have swedish last names . 
  what 's interesting about the finnish names is that sweden 's name * ruotsi * comes from the [ rus people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus'_people ) . 
  in several other european languages , they instead lend their name to russia . 
  but when it 's against sweden ? 
  [ oh boy ] ( https://youtu.be/fbqachnl1ls ) . 
  off-topic really , but there 's a fairly nice cemetery for fallen german soldiers in rovaniemi : [ pic 1 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nczzvn4m4ja/ulgxgrqyipi/aaaaaaaaaso/emzfl-ovkwe/s1600/187.jpg ) , [ pic 2 ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4101/4901954778_30b25638ed_b.jpg ) , [ pic 3 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zvwbtdct9me/ulgznbjc3hi/aaaaaaaaatq/lrqeehmzvak/s1600/dscn7383.jpg ) . 
  it has been faily cold in helsinki this week , hovering below -20 c. 
  now it 's warmer ( -8 c ) and snowing quite a lot . 
  it does look pretty . 
  998 to go ? 
  i 'm pretty happy winter finally [ arrived in finland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cb4xogv.jpg ) . 
   there are plenty of contractors in the world , uber drivers are not special . 
  except that contractors tend to have * a contract * . 
  and they can negotiate the terms . 
  and if they become ill , they wo n't have any income . 
  if their car breaks down , they 'll have no income . 
  it 's like being a small business owner with none of the benefits of owning your own company . 
  sure , but it will probably require a more robust company behind the service , raising prices and making uber very similar to conventional taxi companies . 
  but you need to see things in context . 
  portugal has no real military threats because of its location ( spain is not going to invade ) , so there 's no need for a large force . 
  if portugal was located next to the increasingly erratic russia , the sentiment might be different . 
  but those investors also have some capital commited to the service . 
  by their investment , they ensure a certain quality of cars and drivers . 
  they are a company that is fully responsible for their actions . 
  the uber dream is a model where the workers themselves provide all the needed investments and the distant billionaire receives a fraction of every paid ride , while having next to no commitments or responsibilities . 
  but the goal is the capitalistic dream of all workers being expendable . 
  when the employer is an app , the worker does n't receive any benefits , no vacations , no sick days , no pensions . 
  and what conventional taxi services can guarantee with their prices is certain assured quality of professional drivers , safe cars and service around the clock . 
   since mandatory service was only abolished in 2009 but has n't it been only a tiny percentage serving in the military for decades ?
