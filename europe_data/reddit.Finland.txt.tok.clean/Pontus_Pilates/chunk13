  was it mandatory for only some people ? 
  i do n't know if there 's really any stifling of innovation going on with uber failing . 
  it 's just a part of a bigger wave coming from silicon valley billionaires where the plan is to erode worker 's rights while making sure a tiny percentage of every transaction goes to one rich guy . 
  no need for any standards or safety regulations as you can give ratings with an app . 
  right ? 
   not really . 
  it \u00b4 s wind i know it 's wind . 
  but i still think there 's a diffrence between 87 and 30 . 
   overall , wind farms in the country produced 86.5 gwh on monday , which is equal to 65 % of demand for that day . 
  this was followed by a wind output decline to 29.6 gwh on tuesday . 
  that 's ... quite a difference . 
  he 's like 50 cm taller than stalin . 
  that 's too bad . 
  americans get caught all the time and their doping programs are extensive , yet nobody would dream of shutting them out . 
  kenyan doping is rampart as their own testing is a joke , but their runners are definitely welcome . 
  jamaica has a lot of shady stuff going on , but you have to have usain bolt in rio . 
  and who even knows about china . 
  there is some in helsinki . 
  thanks !, 
  does the asterisk before the root word mean something ? 
  because not all of them have it . 
  yes i know . 
  but i thought finns were above such silliness . 
  what is this ` feels like ' temperature ? 
  in finland we give the actual temperature and try not to make it sound colder than it actually is . 
  yes , unless you are a swedish-speakng finn . 
  living nextdoor exposes you to the constant dick moves coming out of russia . 
  if you live in the us , putin is this cartoon boogeyman somewhere far away . 
  in finland , he 's right over the border and there 's always some shenanigans going on . 
  also , putin 's ukraine adventure and subsequent sanctions have cost finland a lot of money . 
  of course you do n't hug him . 
  but if he brings lego 's , you can let him [ pretty close ] ( http://www.santaclausphoto.fi/userassets/03-dsc03573.jpg ) . 
  is it only a finnish thing that santa himself comes to visit on christmas eve and hands out gifts ? 
  per energy produced , nuclear [ tends to be the safest option ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ ) . 
  why ca n't [ star-man ] ( https://youtu.be/trcpa7fzebw ) bring me any gifts ? 
  i do n't think [ bibi ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2015/2/23/1424714172116/binyamin-netanyahu-009.jpg ) is too concerned about the american reputation . 
  because obama is willing to negotiate with iran and not just bomb them . 
  finland is fully on board and so am i. 
  the problem being , we have this [ fancy new reactor the french are building ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3 ) and it 's ridiculously over budget and a decade late . 
  i guess the next reactor is supposed to be russian , maybe they have more know-how . 
  why is it dangerous in germany if it 's the safest option everywhere else ? 
  i 'd prefer whichever is the cheapest . 
  every jet is capable enough and it 's not like russia is going to attack . 
  i think you can do your independence day flyover with a slightly cheaper plane very well . 
  so , gripen it is . 
  i guess it 's offensive to everybody involved , but there was a finnish humorist who once quipped : * a finn is a mixture between a russian and a human . 
  to be noted , the foreign minister is a long-time euroskeptic and a populist . 
  this does n't reflect the views of the finnish government as a whole . 
  the answer is obviously ham , but it seems like most of europe got mighty confused at the supermarket . 
  it 's as warm as midusmmer in helsinki . 
  the 50 % probability is actually 0 % . 
  i wonder if it will get flooded . 
  yeah , finland is quite flat . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/katximatxis5.png ) is basically our most majestic mountain/fell . 
   you just gobble up anything the eu puts on your plate , do n't you ? 
  this has nothing to do with eu , i just do n't see too much use for civilian firearms . 
  sure , some people love killing animals , but generally , i think guns cause more problems than they solve . 
  well , why would they need those ? 
   pistols are commonly used to kill trapped animals and for sport shooting . 
  and neither activity is what one could call essential to society . 
  i understand that there are people who like making holes in cardboard , but if public safety is better without pistols , i think we can live without them . 
  police officers can kill any suffering animals . 
   but i recently came across an article where it was said that around 90 % of all violent gun crimes are committed with illegal guns . 
  if you care enough you can search it up and potentially prove me wrong , but i feel like this statistic does make sense . 
  well , according to [ yle ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/luvallinenkin_ase_tappaa__lahes_joka_toinen_henkirikoksissa_kaytetty_ase_on_laillinen/6717048 ) , about half of gun homicide is done with illegal guns . 
   almost all guns used in terrorist attacks or shootings are obtained illegally . 
  i think in finnish school shootings , the guns have been legal . 
  and since then , laws have become stricter . 
  which makes sense , civilians do n't really need pistols . 
   instead of banning legal guns , the eu should take measures to fight the illegal gun trade . 
  are you saying eu is n't doing that right now ? 
  are these things mutually exclusive ? 
  you either pursue gun control or you track illegal guns , but you ca n't do both ? 
  is everbody in greece a small business owner ? 
  finnish christmas songs need to be sad . 
  the premier example being [ ` varpunen jouluaamuna ' ] ( https://youtu.be/9bmoafn_ngo ) - * a sparrow on christmas morning * . 
  it 's a story of a cold christmas morning and a little girl feeding seeds to a sparrow . 
  but then the sparrow tells the girl : * `` hey , i 'm not a bird of this earth . 
  i 'm your little brother , i came from heaven . 
  for some reason , the french roundel always looks like it 's red , white and green . 
  at least in finland , the male conscription just is n't an issue . 
  there 's no real demand to end it . 
  the traditional justification is that men serve in military and women have to bear children . 
  hmm . . where 's our group ? 
  why not link to the [ source ] ( https://www.treated.com/dr-wayne-osborne/which-countrys-christmas-dinner-packs-the-most-calories-find-out-with-our-heat-map-of-europe ) , where the map is actually readable ? 
  it 's a roadway , only used when it 's quite cold . 
  * this just in : the bible has some horrible passages !, 
  * both books are clearly texts of their time and can justify the most horrific things . 
  the real questions are in intrepretation and implementation . 
  i do n't really care if people believe in yahweh or allah , but what they justify with that belief is a different thing . 
  i 'd assume it 's quite difficult to fix things when it 's impossible to win elections , so shit-stirring is the best alternative . 
  mmm ... [ kebabpizza ] ( http://www.orebroguiden.com/wp-content/files_flutter/1325064647kebabpizza.jpg ) . 
  with those filters on vocals , it 's debatable if that counts as finnish . 
  the top three would be : - christmas , * joulu * - midsummer , * juhannus * - 1st of may , * vappu * after those , it 's probably a mixture of new year 's eve , easter and independece day . 
  that might be one of the reasons i did n't list it as the only possible reason . 
   i do n't believe that shorter days contribute to finland 's suicide rate . 
  when you live in northern finland and the sun has not risen in three weeks , the long days of summer do n't really improve your mood . 
  sure , but it 's not a direct correlation . 
  italy and greece have only one third of finland 's suicide rate , but it does n't necessarily mean their mental healthcare is three times better . 
  many of the factors are cultural .
