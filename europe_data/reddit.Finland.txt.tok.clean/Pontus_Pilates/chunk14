  i think life expectancy is a pretty bad way to mesure efficiency . 
  say , if we finns drank less and committed fewer suicides , we 'd have a more effective healhcare according to this . 
  or if our traffic was as safe as sweden 's . 
  or if we had different cuisine . 
  estonia and iceland are the cutest . 
  [ iceland 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/exptq2v.png ) looks like a classroom where they had to bring in extra tables . 
  [ estonia 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/afx4tmo.png ) looks like they taped off the walls to paint the doorways .

  i do n't think this would be much different . 
  it 's not like finland is going to send a ground force or one of our five hornets . 
  would n't be happening on european soil , but i 've always wondered why there are n't any awesome movies about vikings meeting native americans . 
  make it somewhat fictional if you must , but vikikings vs. indians would be pretty great . 
  i 'm disappointed there is n't a lamb colony in iceland , tired of the reykjavik oppression and wanting their own land . 
  i prefer [ this version of finlandia ] ( https://youtu.be/6yv0rghhgn4 ) .

  someone well-known in finland , but probably not abroad would be [ arvo ylpp\u00f6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arvo_ylpp%c3%b6 ) , a paediatrician who significantly decreased infant mortality nationwide and set up the current children 's healthcare network in finland . 
  he also lived 104 years . 
  i think the [ sami drum ] ( http://qii.valmiskauppa.fi/images/kuvat/rumpu2504etu.jpg ) deserves a mention . 
  it 's made of reindeer hide , has distinct look and is mainly associated with shamans . 
  i thought we got this out our system last year when every tabloid and their mother was hawking their `` glorious winter war 75 years simo h\u00c4yh\u00c4 ruis leip\u00c4 kollaa kest\u00c4\u00c4 '' special issues . 
  these are usually tricky issues : the public does n't like when politicians get paid a lot , but usually the private sector pays even more and it 's difficult to get the most qualified people to run for office . 
  then again , you do n't necessarily want to turn your parliament into an elititst institution of highly-paid technocrats . 
  and what makes it worse is the facts that the politicians are the ones giving themselves a raise , not the public . 
  it does n't look good if you say : * ` yeah , we decided to take a little more of your tax money . 
  can you conquer us once more ?

  and did turkey assume russia was suddenly attacking them ? 
  or are they just upset that russia 's actions might make isis 's mission of slaughtering kurds a bit harder ? 
  do n't forget glorious [ vesikko ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/vesikko_20090919_01.jpg ) !, 
  a little grease here and there and i 'm sure it 's ready to go . 
  here 's a more urban one : https://youtu.be/tswcl1dsz8s, 
  with quick googlin , it 's bit hard to find any real backing to my claims , but there is stuff like this :  many delaware studies emphasize how the settlers from sweden got along better than other europeans with the indians . 
  this seems to have been the case , for the number of new sweden settlers killed by indians was under ten and the indians never carried out the kinds of raids against new sweden as they did in areas to the north and east as well as in the delaware river region . 
   the good relations between the swedes and indians can be explained from a number of standpoints . 
  researchers point to the mandate from the swedish crown to the settlers to maintain friendly relations with the indians , who , after all , were their trading partners . 
  in addition , the indians at this time were at war with both the dutch and the english . 
  one of the more unusual explanations points out how the new sweden settlers were finns , who were accustomed in the old country to dealing with aborigines , namely , the lapps . 
  http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article152e.htm but you migth be correct nonetheless . 
  just this week , i read an article about the finns in the swedish colony and how they got along with the natives much better than other europeans . 
  apparently simple forest folks who like them some sauna were okay by the indians . 
  when finland gained its independence , there were plans to make [ ovamboland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ovamboland ) ( in present day namibia ) the african colony of finland . 
  finland had been sending missionaries there while still under russia , but unsurprisingly , the colonization never happened . 
  decades later martti ahtisaari , the future president of finland , oversaw namibia 's independence process from south africa . 
  i guess to this day , of all the african countries , namibia has a special status in finland .

  they are used in some foreign names , such as ovet\u0161kin , azerbaid\u017ean or t\u0161ekki ( czech republic ) . 
  but you also see it written as tshekki . 
  outside of names , there are some loanwords , but you rarely see them . 
  the word for a marker pen * tussikyn\u00e4 * , but it used to be spelled * tu\u0161\u0161ikyn\u00e4 * . 
  i think it 's still acceptable , but you do n't see it used in modern context . 
  usually it can be replaced with s or sh . 
  in some native words ? 
  i 've seen it in names and i think it appears in some french loanwords . 
  i assume it only demostrates how old this whole thing is . 
  they forgot [ a few ] ( http://i.imgur.com/okixtc0.png ) . 
  by the way , how come it 's cheaper to fly to paris than to helsinki ? 
  [ checks out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tea_consumption_per_capita ) . 
  also , from what i 've experienced , turkish tea comes in tiny cups , so the amount of cups per day must be impressive .

  that does look nice . 
  in helsinki , even the pet cemetary was filled with candles . 
  one thing all these dashcam nations do really well : capture stuff falling from the skies .

  if internet is right , they already produce their electricity from renevable sources .

  i found out that the finnish term is [ kyl\u00e4keinu ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyl%c3%a4keinu ) . 
  however , [ this image also came up ] ( http://shl.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kukkolan-keinu.jpg ) and looks extremely cool . 
  oh , summer and all those little bloodsuckers . 
  the pillar is pretty r\u00e5d . 
  here are the guidelines of finnish customs : http://www.tulli.fi/en/persons/travel_relocation/alcohol_and_tobacco/index.jsp, 
  as a background , alcohol is cheaper in estonia and you are allowed to bring quite a lot it for personal use . 
  not for resale though , so everybody always claims it 's for your own consumption . 
  but apparently 11 000 liters does n't seem * that * plausible , and a man was found guilty of tax fraud . 
  the court ruled that maybe one third could have been for personal use . 
  well , it is easier to sell cheap pizza if your workers are paid off-the-books , 5 $ per hour . 
  as much as this is about tax avoidance , it can also be seen as protection of workers . 
  it 's not unusual to see worker abuse in foreign-owned restaurants , especially if the workers are in the country illegally . 
  for a foreigner , finding work in finland is hard enough , it 's not like they are going to contact the authorities if their employer does n't give them the mandated coffee breaks . 
  for full quality , you need to save them on your computer , which is quite bad design .

  well , first you offer low taxes . 
  you wo n't have that many domestic companies or citizens anyway , so a few wealthy foreign ones can really benefit your small economy .
