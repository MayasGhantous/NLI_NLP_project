  also , they have very little government spending . 
  no big infrastructure like railways or ports , no army , no agricultural subsidies . 
  it 's very much from helsinki . 
  the waterfront in the video is somewhere around [ here ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.1668587,24.9076377,3a,75y,344.18h,83.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxl_f-i_p50dzbuh7ie2neq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) . 
  yeah , maybe . 
  but just because it 's got elon musk associated with it , does n't mean it 's somehow magical . 
  the battery technology goes forward rather slowly and no clever branding will make it suddenly * the answer * . 
  they are just batteries , nothing special about them . 
  running a steel mill or a server farm from some homeowner 's back-up battery will be , let 's just say * a challenge * . 
   what happens in winter - how long will it stay dark ? 
  a crappy picture i snapped today , but the squirrels are really [ starting to turn grey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1tswf7x.jpg ) . 
  the problem is , you still need to have back-up capacity to power the entire network . 
  when the sun goes down and the winds settle , you ca n't just turn off the electricity . 
  and you ca n't just have a couple of conventional power plants as a back-up , you need to be able to meet the peak demand if needed . 
  or you 'll have blackouts . 
   he has a big mouth , but is there anything but hot air ? 
  of course not . 
  yeah , might very well be , i 'm not really that interested in his * actual * positions . 
  rather , my point was trump 's seeming willingness to show his middle finger to the republican consensus , which just does n't seem happen . 
  whenever a republican accidentally supports something bordering sane , their base will cry foul and the candidate will backtrack and take the first turn right . 
  i mean , he 's an idiot . 
  from what i 've seen , the only redeeming quality is his willingness to go against the party line . 
  it seems like all the other republican candidates are terrified and do n't dare to have own opinions . 
  on a handful of issues , like taxation or abortion , trump sounds like the most level-headed of the bunch . 
  which is terrifying . 
   and there is the risk of being stabbed apparently lithuanian teachers are willing to kill , so it should make for interesting school days . 
  well , if they are serious about starting a ruckus syria , it makes sense they 'd need equipment to do so . 
  i doubt that georgia and turkey are very willing to give them a permission to drive through . 
  i do n't know , i find the norwegians to be a shady bunch . 
  what 's with all that skiing ? 
  icelanders do n't dare to upset their elves . 
   the peace index has little to nothing to do with whatever happens domestically inside the country , such as crime and law enforcement . 
  so when the article states that france dropped because of the charlie hebdo attacks , it 's lying ? 
  i 'm quite happy it 's much harder to get one here in finland . 
  we have enough people poking holes in each other with kitchen knives , no need to give them anything that makes a loud bang . 
  also , depressed teens . 
  there 's a difference between being in reserves and participating in reservist activities . 
  sort of like adult boy scouts . 
   which means if sweden gets invaded or feel war is imminent , everyone between ages 19-47 can be drafted to fight , even those who have not done any prior military training are there numbers about how many swedes in total have gone through military training ? 
  a couple of points about finland : - the number of reserves only counts those who have a designated role , should a conflict start . 
  this year , the army contacted all men in reserves and the number was around 900 000 , so a larger force could be deployed . 
  - the number of planes is too high , or at least misleading . 
  the finnish air force has about 60 f-18 's and that 's about it . 
  the rest are bae hawk trainer jets that can be armed , but are n't all that imposing . 
  and maybe there are some old mig 's or drakens in a secret hangar somewhere , but really , the finnish airforce is no more than 60 jets . 
  be careful dave , the muslims do n't share your fondness for swine !, 
  ukraine already had that sort of peace for most of the 20th century . 
  and i do n't think they want to return to it . 
  why do you have a netherlands flair ? 
  not only crimea , the whole ukraine situation just got worse . 
  trump had paul manafort run his campaign , who in turn was deep in ukraine 's pro-russia side . 
  this might give putin even more room to operate in ukraine . 
  it 's beautiful outside , but biking home from work in a blizzard is a bit taxing . 
  how 's life in prison anyway ? 
  he 's so young he has n't had time to grow out a full wig . 
  for finland , it 's probably important to remember that most of that renewable energy comes from burning wood and peat . 
  the share of solar and wind energy is more or less non-existent and there is n't that much hydropower either . 
  i think foreigners fail to grasp just how uninteresting this data is . 
  sure , there 's a day or two of tabloid voyerism , but in everyday life , nobody cares . 
  once it 's no longer a secret , it 's very mundane . 
  why would i check someone 's income ? 
  there 's also a service where you can find a car 's owner by texting the plate to a certain number . 
  i could find out who owns some new bentley i see on the street , but i really ca n't be bothered . 
  i wonder how far it will last . 
  finnish people voted in our own far right populists some years ago and once they got into government , they were exposed as the ineffective village idiots most people suspected they were . 
  i feel like this sort of populism best works in opposition when you have no resposibilities and you can just blame those in power . 
  once you get elected and * actually * have to do something , it 's rather impossible to hold on to your principles . 
  which inevitably leads to a disappointment in voters . 
  maybe there are a few hundred slovaks in czech prisons which makes their number so large . 
  i do n't know , i 'm just guessing . 
   divide them by the sum amount of citizens . 
  ( that 's what the article did ), 
  i quite like that * citium * is the only word the spell check has a problem with . 
  in the 90 's there was the grandiose sounding [ great nordic biker war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_nordic_biker_war ), 
  well , it was * `` european countries with the longest coastlines '' * , not longest coastlines in europe . 
  also , russia would make the list , even if you took their coastline this side of ural . 
  the kola peninsula and novaya zemlya for example are massive . 
  * cough * russia * cough *, 
  happens to everybody : you get chapped lips and accidentally buy the only lip balm with anabolic steroids in it . 
  and even though you are sports doctor , you miss the massive ** doping ** text on the box . 
  it 's not hard to have a clear stance on the matter : you should n't be fined for your livejournal musings . 
  she went ahead and [ played it ] ( https://www.varusteleka.fi/pictures/14669.jpg ) . 
  you should see a finnish dairy isle . 
  there 's every sort of milk , both with and without lactose . 
  the dairy companies have all sorts of patented fancy ways of removing lactose while maintaining the taste . 
  better than the [ finnish one ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xm4zqq67xhi/uk1glcyqb6i/aaaaaaaadto/xznghcujnji/s1600/marraskuun+harmaa+sa%cc%88a%cc%88.jpg ) . 
  in the 90 's , there was a finnish commercial for a teleoperator where a man calls someone in finland , exchanges a few pleasantries and then goes : `` actually , i did have something i needed to ask . 
  how would you put the following in chinese : * when i entered this room , it was already broken ? 
  * '' https://youtu.be/rw3ls4o1ojq, 
  wheh ... my football-watching is legal ? 
   i 'm paying for the show , and so are you . 
  yeah , in other countries armies are free and do n't need any taxes . 
  [ leroy ] ( http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i/?img=/photo/2016/1231/r40350_1296x729_16-9.jpg&amp;w=1500&amp;h=1500&amp;scale=crop&amp;site=espnfc ) is always your friend . 
  perhaps the cream of the society has other plans and does n't end up in military . 
  i wonder how jutta rabe is doing . 
  is n't russia part of the second world ? 
  well , i personally endorse john cleese . 
  does it hurt that much less when you are a toddler ? 
  finland already had [ freedom to roam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam ) . 
  well , mixing blue and yellow creates green .
