  now that libya has changed its flag , sweden is the obvious winner . 
  ( also , good on zambia for beating denmark . 
  i wonder what their [ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/flag_of_zambia.svg/1024px-flag_of_zambia.svg.png ) looks like ... ), 
  and lottery , sports betting , all that sort of stuff . 
   the report finds that russia is the only state in sweden 's neighborhood that , in the foreseeable future , could conceivable engage in military aggression against its neighbors . 
  good . 
  they do n't suspect anything ... 
  people wrap fish and wipe asses with ipad . 
  i remember when the first iphone launched in finland , there were more reporters than customers at the store . 
  well , being fat would be a sign of immense wealth then ? 
  the sign in [ this pic ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/413988/landscape16_9/555/313/3ee903d7176f4eb12fb6820f1b6c0447/zr/1029179.jpg ) does n't look like seven different buses stop there . 
  that sounds like an explanation , but is n't the correct one . 
  this same sight can be observed at bus stops and buses only have one entrance . 
  these pics get posted every now and then and what i 'm most proud of is that everybody knows the exact , proper distance . 
  what are the little fenced-off squares in the first pic ? 
  are they supposed to house trees ? 
  chickens ? 
  children ? 
  suicide rates and overall happiness do n't seem to have very much in common . 
  this is once again one of those maps . 
  why color the whole country if we are comparing cities ? 
  also , why are the people of vilnius so fucking happy ? 
  i 'd like to think that we are just practical people who get stuff done . 
  when it comes time to kill oneself , we do n't fool around . 
   probably occupying \u00c5land or something they already kind of did : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bomarsund, 
  i have a friend who moved to new zealand and his problem was that the locals did n't know how to have booze without fun . 
  as in ` viidakkoveitsi ' and ` k\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6veitsi ' . 
  that would never happen in good bentheim . 
  you are forgetting incorrectly waxed skis which either slip all the time or collect a 5 cm layer of snow on the bottom . 
  that endless row of hotels looks like the tasteful tourist destinations i build in tropico . 
  is steen christensen out of prison already ? 
  the finnish santa definitely does n't say ho ho ho . 
  one aim of this trial is to see how it encourages people to seek at least some employment . 
  at the moment , there are limits to how much you can earn while still earning full benefits . 
  this discourages a certain part of the population from taking low-paying jobs . 
  why work if you make more just sitting home ? 
  with basic income , you can work as much as you like and not lose the benefits . 
  also , it is supposed to reduce bureaucracy . 
  you do n't need to prove your dire straits , you just get a lump sum of money , no matter what . 
  i think the number is a bit low actually . 
  turkish people are not refugees or eu citizens , so those who got residence permits in finland had jobs lined up . 
  that helps a lot with their overall image . 
  but i guess we are naturally suspicious of anyone with curly hair and a bit of fur on their arms . 
  on the shoulder patch , why is the text in english ? 
  and the patch so poorly sewn ? 
  the finnish justice system will find a way . 
  one woman got a more lenient sentence from homicide as she was a first-time offender , only it happened twice . 
  she also failed to return to an open prison from her gardening duties and the police did n't bother to start a search . 
  to be fair , i do n't really have a problem with our justice system and despite the occasional outrage , it seems to be working just fine on a societal level . 
  crime is fairly low and so is recidivism . 
  i wonder if these people can be returned to iraq for a trial since it 's peaceful enough to return asylum seekers ? 
  or will he serve his 18-month suspended sentence in finland . 
  but the headline claims that it 's about the eu . 
  there are these hills in helsinki central park where men would do their business in the cover of thick forest , in secret . 
  you can still see men walking the paths among the woods , but obviously it is n't quite the spot anymore . 
  i guess some dudes still like the excitement of going to town while middle-aged ladies are walking their dogs just 20 metres away . 
  and is a frequent topic of conversation : * what would yugoslavian national team look like today ? 
  and zils too . 
  yeah , the periphery is rarely celebrated in europe . 
  now * that 's * a challenge . 
  we are pretty good at driving and drinking . 
  i believe in our boys . 
   drunk citizens per capita by the lake finns usually celebrate in the lake . 
  i guess to honor john the baptist ? 
  after every midsummer , the papers tell how many people drowned this year . 
  finland has a pretty sweet [ uaz fleet ] ( http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/2253681946_7fec9a30b9.jpg ) . 
  are you maybe interested in those ? 
  we only received about 100 [ vehicles ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/20136260_uu.jpg ) from the netherlands . 
  rather strange then that [ he ] ( https://perennialunderachievers.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/promopicture.jpg ) would base his [ football club ] ( http://edgecast.sdr-files.buscafs.com/uploads/news/photos/news_photo_32355_1356319554.jpg ) in finland . 
  i 've never quite understood why the [ temppeliaukio church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/temppeliaukio-helsinki-by-ralfr-1.jpg ) is supposed to be so wonderful . 
  sure , it was carved into a rock , but beyond that , i do n't really see the charm . 
  i feel bad for the asian tourists who have paid thousands of euros to make their long-awaited trip to europe and they are taken to a rocky church , a [ runner statue by a garbage bin ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oebvxq2fp4m/u8udzuvcadi/aaaaaaaadm4/eo_zykxztno/s1600/p1040909.jpg ) and to gawk at some [ steel pipes welded together ] ( https://itislukio.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_6564.jpg ) . 
  i want to go tell them : * `` i 'm so sorry you are not in prague . 
  i assume the place is run over by jack & jones douches . 
  it is quite interesting . 
  i would like it more with a date for each picture and one map with the continental ice shelf from the last maximum . 
  normalisation means that britain is willing to admit that russia has a right to invade its neighbours . 
  russia has done nothing to change its behaviour , so this can only signal that britain has decided that the behaviour was n't so bad in the first place . 
  or the second mongolian state . 
  well , the economy is n't so hot what with the euro crisis , the fall of nokia and the vanishing russian exports due to sanctions . 
  not too easy to find positive economic news . 
  i wonder where finland would fall . 
  we do spend a fair amount of energy , but we also insulate like hell . 
  my triple-glazed windows are 20 cm deep and definitely do n't let any draft in . 
   that incident was n't controversial . 
  maybe i was n't being entirely serious ? 
  sure . 
  there 's a tremendous amount of transparency when practically every male has been a part of that organization and people have a very good grasp of what 's going on in there . 
  it 's not some collection of cold-blooded mercenaries , rather it 's a bunch of regular assholes like me . 
  i imagine that it all went down the toilet after [ police shot and killed a man in 2013 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/iceland-armed-police-shoot-man-dead-first-time ) . 
  of course everybody was really sorry about the incident , but i 'd guess it will take decades to build back that trust . 
  4 ) your experiences do n't reflect the society at large . 
  few personal anecdotes are n't necessarily very good data . 
  well , that was n't the entire red army . 
  they had over six million soldiers fighting germany , but less than million invading finland . 
  had those six million marched towards helsinki ... 
   my own insecurities ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
  you state that sweden slips on the list because of ` skewed rape statistics ' when no such thing happens . 
  i 'm suggesting that you look at the data and not go for the first excuse .
