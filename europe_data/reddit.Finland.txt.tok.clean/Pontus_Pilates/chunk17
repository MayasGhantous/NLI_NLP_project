  well , if you look at the [ actual stats ] ( http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#page/indexes/global-peace-index/2016/swe/over ) instead of projecting your own insecurities , sweden mostly loses points because of its massive arms export business . 
  complaining about these sorts of indexes is childish , but i do want to point out that finland ( along norway and australia ) gets docked points for importing weapons . 
  we 'd be a more peaceful country if we had more local arms producers , like they do in russia or the us ? 
   for instance , germany would almost certainly rank higher , but under the current system they are not because they are a significant arms exporter . 
  sooo ... you are not actually speaking about sweden here ? 
  that 's because their ancestors came up north and thought to themselves , * ` hmm , let 's not settle right next to russia . 
  how about this coastal spot with all the fish and the oil ? 
  ' * [ us finns ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/1920/aafa87e07e6c462f8d52df221514acc1.jpg ) , not so much . 
   thinking they are better than us ... 
  they probably are . 
  there 's the concept of * maiden of finland * . 
  our [ old map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/finland_1920.png ) was seen as a woman in a skirt , with arms raised . 
  the part thrusting between sweden and norway is still known as the ` arm ' . 
  if i 'm pulling a hypothesis out of my ass , i would think that this is a combination of stagnant wages and emptying countryside . 
  if i wanted to live in some dying small town , i could probaly afford multiple apartments . 
  when god promised real estate to abraham , it was mainly lands in the canaan . 
  the arctic has never been that popular among the chosen people . 
  who eats turkey at christmas ? 
  that 's barbaric . 
  it 's not really that complicated either : there 's value liberalism and economic liberalism . 
  it 's not one dimesional spectrum , it 's a two-axis chart ( something like [ this ] ( https://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pic_201105_68.gif ) ) . 
  and since we never qualify to the world cup or the euros , we had to host our own tournament : https://youtube.com/watch?v=it9kbjw_nqs, 
  to add : the city of [ yakutsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yakutsk ) has average january temperature of \u2212 38.6 \u00b0 c. 
  that is fairly cold . 
  it 's okay guys , it seems to host the [ culturally significant mcdonald 's ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/14/063/org/mv5418d4_141558_4235101.jpg ) . 
  ( also , it 's not an ugly building , just does n't fit in there . ), 
  well , in the same vein , there 's the [ kannelm\u00e4ki ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/99050024.jpg ) and [ lauritsala ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3sckuksni68/vuou4xtfnfi/aaaaaaaaali/-ffjti7ur5w/s1600/lappeenranta,%2blauritsalan%2bkirkko,%2b%2b%e2%80%9dtaivaan%2bvalo%e2%80%9d,%2b1969,%2btoivo%2bkorhonen%2bja%2bjaakko%2blaapotti.jpg ) churches , but i figured they had too much style to them . 
  i mean , why would n't it be ? 
  seems like the most logical option to me . 
  of course the article is marred by some douche talking about * ` creative energies ' * . 
   what else they should practice for ? 
  well , many smaller european countries have reduced their militaries to a handful of units . 
  and those units tend to prepare for smaller internal conflicts , maybe for some foreign ventures with nato . 
  some fast moving special units , that sort of thing . 
  not all armies are like the finnish one , always preparing for a full-on ground invasion from the yellow state . 
  well no , the asylum-seekers have n't become citizens . 
  this new decree does n't concern those who have already been granted recidence permits , like the somali refugees from the 90 's . 
  this is about a more recent batch of asylum-seekers , those milling around in reception centers , hoping to get a permanent recidence in finland . 
  in order to get unemployment benefits , they 'd need a residence permit . 
  if they are not asylum-seekers any more , they will have hard time getting any such permit . 
  social services and education are not offered to just anyone who merely shows up . 
  but this decision at least changes their status so they are no longer asylum-seekers . 
  that will most likely end government payments to them . 
  and living in finland with no government assistance , no papers and no language skills certainly is n't easy . 
  not too many jobs available for undocumented people who only speak pashto . 
  while i share some of your frustrations , it 's also important to remember that the finnish sentencing structure is there to serve society at large , not to satisfy some lynch mobs . 
  there does n't seem to be any evidence that harsher sentences deter crime or make societies safer in any way . 
  the long term goal of the finnish prison system is to make the inmates into contributing citizens , and by things such as recidivism rates , it 's doing a much better job than the american system you so admire . 
  as to how much the victim would be helped if the perpetrator was locked up for longer , i ca n't know . 
   for all its virtues , finland is n't a very good place to be a rape victim out of sheer curiosity , what are your top destinations to get raped in ? 
  it 's like one of those german board games : it does n't take too long , the rules are simple enough and while skill is important , there 's enough luck involved to make it unpredictable . 
  that 's partly because of the sanctions . 
  [ 2013 situation ] ( https://rajatontatiedekasvatusta.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/tal761.png ) . 
  russia 's portion is shrinking , but i do n't know if it 's being replaced at the same rate . 
   finland will outlast them at this pace . 
  see , to me it 's not about outlasting . 
  i do n't want russia to be destroyed , its people poor and the country in chaos . 
  i 'd much rather live next door to a stable and prosperous russia so we can trade with them . 
  a broke and hurting russia is much more unpredictable . 
  yeah , that 's how it goes . 
  everything we sell to russia just magically goes to western countries . 
  i 'm sure americans are dying to import finnish cheese . 
  the eu sanctions have already hurt the finnish economy very hard and no western nation has suddenly appeared to replace russia as one of our biggest trading partners . 
  do you know why ? 
  because countries have different needs and different relationships . 
  i 'd rather have good relationships with our neighbours . 
  and our economy would also tank , since russia would put in place unreasonalbe sanctions . 
  our two countries also have a lot of cross-border travel and co-operation . 
  those would become really difficult too . 
  it 's different to look at these things when you are actually sharing a border and have to deal with the day-to-day interactions . 
  it 's much easier to draw dramatic conclusions when you are far away and are just happy to rattle some sabers . 
  well , i feel perfectly safe outside of nato . 
  russia has no reason to attack finland , they ca n't wage ukraine-style hybrid warfare here and our army is strong enough to make any outright invasion a costly mess . 
  better to keep up good diplomatic and trade relationships . 
  well , finland for starters . 
  joining nato would be an excellent way to tank our economy even further . 
  russia would make any trade with them impossible . 
  the * ` probable human carcinogen ' * label in itself is n't necessarily that damning . 
  the [ list ] ( http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/generalinformationaboutcarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens ) includes things such as :  hairdresser or barber ( workplace exposure as )  very hot beverages ( above 65oc ) from what i undestand , glyphosate is very effective in what it does and it 's not like we have a bunch of superior alternatives just waiting their turn . 
   viking line ferries oh , you mean the hagert line ? 
  the problem is n't with the video , it 's with the title . 
  the video is very well done , but when you present it as * ` around europe ' * , europeans expect it to mean more than london and paris . 
  as the report says :  there is relatively little common ancestry shared between the italian peninsula and other locations , and what there is seems to derive mostly from longer ago than 2,500 ya . 
  [ easy now ] ( https://d1vxw9s9d8pjrr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/24104922/easynow_itmightbewhisky_familylife.jpg ), 
   it seems to me that if na lobster were going to thrive in europe they will have had cross contamination opportunities for hundreds of years already . 
  by crawling along the bottom of the atlantic ocean to the murky waters of the baltic ? 
  luckily we live in a connected world . 
  in centuries past , a weather like this could spoil much of the harvest and you 'd be eating tree bark for the following year . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  i do n't really get it . 
  i do n't think maine gains anything if their lobsters conquer our seas . 
  it 's not like europe profits from all the invasive species we 've spread over the centuries . 
  well , it 's certainly not an ocean , but there can be waves :  the biggest basin of the baltic sea , the baltic proper , has the most severe wave climate in the baltic sea . 
  during storm rafael on 22 december 2004 , the significant wave height in northern baltic proper reached 8.2 metres and the highest individual wave height was 14 metres . 
  they are obviously trying to manipulate the public opinion . 
  by orchestrating this excercise , they 'll get the predictable reaction out of russia and hope to sway people towards nato . 
  * `` look , russia is scary , we really should join . 
  of course one can train with other countries , but the government very well knows what sort of a reaction it will draw from russia and is eager to use that reaction to push their nato agenda . 
  if their goal was to lower the tensions in the baltic region , they would obviously not invite american forces to finland .
