  but now they can act surprised and claim that we * need * nato because of these new , heightened tensions . 
  have such a desire to sit in the big kids ' table that it 's getting embarrasing . 
  this is going beautifully according to the plan from our pro-nato government . 
  they know that the finnish people do n't want anything to do with nato , so they come up with some bullshit reason of * `` we need to co-operate with our allies '' * and invite the us military to our soil . 
  and they know very well what sort of reaction it will provoke out of russia . 
  now they can point to it as some sort of proof that finland * needs * to be in nato . 
  well , that 's still ten times the finnish numbers . 
  it 's cheaper and probably more energy efficient to burn all the various household plastics for energy than trying to sort through and cleanse them . 
  unless of course it 's something like recycling plastic bottles , where the incoming material is consistent . 
  at least they are trying too hard . 
  i 'm sure they taste awful . 
  well , it [ is n't 100 ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/5378785264.png ) . 
  but [ pohjanmaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrobothnia_%28historical_province%29 ) is much furhter north . 
  apart from the obvious nordic jokes , that 's a beautiful livery . 
  finland was supposed to get a [ 100 mbps connection available to everybody by 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/10461048 ) . 
  i wonder how that 's going ? 
  i guess most people are living in areas where that could be theoretically possible with 4g . 
  that 's a fine-looking bridge . 
  well done . 
  oh no , the man 's saddled with gevalia . 
   they 're a sensationalist tabloid , through and through . 
  they are a tabloid , but generally quite reliable . 
  they are n't doing too much * hard * reporting , but they also are n't in the business of making up stories . 
  there 's even a possibility to pre-order your booze and it awaits you on the ship , [ nicely packed ] ( http://oi60.tinypic.com/2cyjvdc.jpg ) . 
  in finland , berries are usually sold by the litre . 
  [ outdoor markets ] ( http://hs12.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/700/1404792292679?ts=13 ) tend to charger about 4-6 $ per litre . 
  a general mixture of lack of any tan and a hair that is the color of a dirt road . 
  finnish men can be identified by their gray complexion , bad haircuts and by the fact that every last one of them is wearing some variation of [ this shirt ] ( http://oldnavy.gap.com/asset_archive/onweb/assets/product/582/582221/main/on582221-00p01v01.jpg?01ad=3hkyclw0npi5i7jvtjralr5estek0cdvqnob017luzdhz_p1n5n04bw&amp;01ri=44bf7bad725dfc4&amp;01na=&amp;redirect=true ) . 
  my swedish clearly fails me . 
  i would have pronounced it closer to * griipen * , not * grippen * like this fella . 
  is spain okay ? 
  how come the germans and the swedes drink more wine than them ? 
  the germans spend their days drinking beer and still manage to consume more wine that the people of spain .

  i 'm happy that finlandia is n't our anthem . 
  it 's such a beautiful song that you would n't want a bunch of drunks in their skoda helmets belting it out . 
  reserve it for the occasion . 
  we won canada 4-0 , how did your game against them go ? 
  it 's the same music even : https://youtu.be/stxlxqen6ho, 
  as seen on [ reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3bbpcb/greatest_finnish_word_ever/ ) . 
  there 's also * pussikalja * ( lit .

  it 's one of those commemorative coins , but i quite like the finnish [ united nations 60 years coin ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/shared/img/comm_2005_fi_800.jpg ) . 
  i always find it somewhat surprising how far south the large canadian cities are . 
  even a frozen hellhole like winnipeg is further south than frankfurt . 
  it 's also from a fan-edited wiki , not from an official ea document . 
  they are protected , but not endangered . 
  the size of the population is being watched , but also licences to hunt are granted ( for [ ~ 500 lynxes in 2015 ] ( http://riista.fi/ilveksen-kannanhoidollinen-metsastys-alkaa/ ) ) . 
  the question was : how do norway and finland know their lynx populations so precisely ? 
  and the offered answer was that they are endagered , which just is n't true . 
  but the lynx is n't endangered . 
  same goes for [ finland ] ( https://faneille.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1.jpg ) . 
  eesti went all out . 
  the ` narrative ' is that those are private matters . 
  the press can have some basic human decency . 
  i do n't know why the press should revel in brutality just so some racists can have something to jerk off on . 
  we call swedes what other europeans call russians . 
  [ the rus ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus%27_people ) . 
  even stranger , the germans usually like to add an extra 'n' to finnland . 
  maybe the more southern parts do n't freeze over every winter ? 
  i do n't know . 
  [ * `` silvio berlusconi , the man who puts ` dick ' into ` predictable ' , the ` prick ' into ` what a prick ' and the ` cock ' into absolutely anything that moves and probably a few fair things that do n't move as well .

  what happened was the worst scenario for the populitsts : they got into government and had to make actual decisions . 
  also , it 's a one-man-party and he 's resigning , so the party is rather rudderless . 
  [ here 's a non-tiny version ] ( http://www.bilder.beofnf.de/karten%20histor%20material/skandinavien01.jpg ) . 
  also , i 've read somewhere that finland is the only country in the world where the whole coastline freezes regularly . 
  well , the man was n't a refugee , rather a construction worker from uzbekistan . 
  then again , all european contries have plnety of people who have overstayed their welcome . 
  the police simply do n't have resources to go around searching for all of them in order to deport those people . 
  they 'll be picked up if they come across the authortities . 
  so because they are investing so heavily , the fare does n't cover the cost of the ride ? 
  those things do n't seem connected . 
   uber are private hire vehicles here rather than taxis , so they change that dynamic . 
  the other way to ` change the dynamic ' is to take massive losses . 
   after a discombobulated 2016 , in which uber burned through more than $ 2 billion , amid findings that rider fares only cover roughly 40 percent of a ride , with the remainder subsidized by venture capitalists http://jalopnik.com/uber-is-doomed-1792634203, 
  also , shame for it being so ugly . 
  the site is nice and the building could be great ... if it did n't look quite so hideous . 
  still one of my favorite colbert bits : http://krankr.com/clip/videos.php/photo/50947/stephen_colbert_on_fresco_christ_restoration/ ( sorry about the sketchy video host , that 's all i could find . 
  comedy central was geoblocked . ), 
  to be fair , the people in the pic i posted do n't look finnish . 
  i do wonder if he , by some miracle , got elected , how much he could actually do ? 
  how much time would it take to get anything moving when the whole government is based on corruption . 
  why is the srpski telegraf in latin alphabet ? 
  is it for croatians or something ? 
  * `` removed '' * ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  is it considered immigration if the border moves and you stay put ? 
   is n't that fourth piece illegal in and of itself ? 
  like selling snus ? 
   from speaking with finns , i understand there 's another important difference , while systembolaget is a genuinely great retailer with excellent service and a wide range of products in all shops , the same ca n't be said about alko . 
  well , it depends on the specific alko store , but they generally do have a pretty good selection and decent prices . 
  i mean , alcohol is not cheap in finland and vodka will cost several times more than in some other european countries , but alko is such a big buyer that they can sell some of the more rare stuff at a reasonable price . 
  then again , i do n't know what finnish products people would buy . 
  apart from [ scissors ] ( http://www.thesewingdirectory.co.uk/tinyimages/89/fiskarsscissors.jpg ) . 
  my guess would be that there is correlation , but no causation . 
  construction increases during an economic boom . 
  the inevitable downturn that follows is n't caused by the skyscrapers , but does happen after their construction . 
  then again , we have to live in a real world .
