  yeah , i watched the video . 
  so apparently [ they are a symbol of corruption now ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vc9zrs7.jpg ) ? 
  there was a photo on navalny today with him holding a pair of sneakers . 
  apparently they hold symbolism too ? 
  medvedev reportedly owns a house for the purpose of raising ducks . 
  the guardian wrote an article about [ kensington palace gardens ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/07/londons-most-expensive-street-kensington-palace-gardens ) . 
  the only one to invite them in ? 
  the finnish ambassador . 
  how to make the perfect finnish coffee : - take out your [ cup ] ( https://esales.hartman.fi/images/thumbnails/400x300/items/tuotekuva_gr63_490.png ) - grab the pot - fill your cup to the brim optional : - pour excess coffee to the sink ( while burning your fingers ) to make room for milk - add milk, 
  the presidential handball jacket . 
  we achieved our renewables goals by just burning our forests and swamps . 
  happens in helsinki too , maybe not quite to this extent . 
  but people on a tram stop will leave a good 3-5m between each other . 
  i wonder if they are [ pescara fans ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/7/72/pescarastemma.png ) . 
  the meltdown over at [ the_d ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5zjs9t/the_netherlands_is_seeing_a_turnout_like_theyve/?sort=new ) is a fun read . 
  tatu vanhanen , the co-author of that book , is the father of former finnish prime minister matti vanhanen . 
  while in office , he had to renounce his dad 's racist ideas . 
  and on some level , finland might have benefitted from its war reparations to soviet union . 
  while initially a heavy burden for a struggling economy , the reparations helped introduce finnish products to the soviet market . 
  when the reparations were completed , finland had its industry going and an eager trading partner ready to buy . 
   under the plan , 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) of new metro tracks and 68 stations will be added to the capital 's transport network . 
  helsinki has been struggling to construct one tenth of that for almost a decade now . 
  also :  as an add-on to the `` grand paris '' plan , the french parliament also voted to spend 1.7 billion euros to develop a new train connecting paris to the main international charles de gaulle airport in 20 minutes , or half the time it now takes on a heavily-used commuter line . 
  this should help attract tourists , according to valerie pecresse , the head of the ile-de-france region . 
  are n't there quite enough tourists in paris already ? 
   switzerland is balkan , it 's confirmed . 
  i think it 's been know [ for some time ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q_lvpebq2vc/v08aikjcjui/aaaaaaaaaf4/tyfuk7cnqqeq13fnxxjareh2hukipffjwclcb/s1600/swiss_team_0.jpg ) . 
  the bright side seems to be that it 's hard to pour a lot of legal money into european elections . 
  donating 100 000 $ seems miniscule compared to the hundreds of millions americans donate to their own parties . 
  on the plus side , we got some [ pretty sweet tanks ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/20136260_uu.jpg ) for a great price . 
  m\u00e4ki ( hill ) and oja ( ditch ) are both finnish words . 
  and soini is basically the whole party . 
  with him stepping down , it 's a collection of bland politicians with varying levels of racism . 
  it 's going to get worse . 
  i had to find [ a picture of the stairway ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nmkaqoy1r_y/vy1s2v2rh4i/aaaaaaaarck/kv9b1huv7ne/s1600/dscn0672.jpg ) . 
  and it still starts with :  * me aleksander kolmas , jumalan armosta , koko ven\u00e4j\u00e4nmaan keisari ja itsevaltias , puolanmaan tsaari , suomen suuriruhtinas , y. m. , y. m. , y. m. * or  * we alexander iii , by the grace of god , the emperor and ruler of all of russia , the tsar of poland , the grand duke of finland , etc , etc , etc *, 
  would commute be considered ` leisure time ' ? 
   do we have to find a new storage place every 100 years and where w8ill those be and who 's paying to find one . 
  people do n't want potential risks for 10.000 years in their neighborhood . 
  has n't been a problem in finland . 
  we are [ boring through bedrock as we speak ] ( https://phys.org/news/2016-06-finns-nuclear-world-costliest-tomb.html ) and the residents could n't be happier with all the wealth a huge project like that is creating for their community . 
  but where 's the ketchup ? 
   e.g. 
  a `` cult '' is really just a religion that did n't make it ( yet ) . 
  that 's not correct either . 
  a cult ca n't be strictly defined , but not every small religion is a cult . 
  some of the usual features are efforts to control members ' lives and to insulate them from non-members . 
  and some bigger religions show clear signs of cultism , like mormonism . 
  a finnish made icebreaker maybe ? 
  the text seems cyrillic . 
  i like my finnish icebreakers to [ blend into the background ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/icebreaker-voima.jpg ) . 
  maybe he 's the swedish [ johan b\u00e4ckman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b%c3%a4ckman ) , a finnish `` human rights activist '' who 's always available to bad-mouth finland on russian tv . 
  the british rabble-rouser [ david myatt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_myatt ) went through a similar transition . 
  he also had his satanic phase . 
  i would n't call [ makkara ] ( http://verkkouutisetfi.s3.amazonaws.com/9c146c921bdb11475caa736d3e82bf652273b7e9a26c942186a4e3fb59d3b6db ) a sandwich . 
  ** we passed the dutch by 0,3 % !, 
  and dam you netherlands . 
  or rather he sees the writing on the wall , he 'll be in the big office by june and needs to keep the relationships going . 
  i prefer the german fox over the spanish douches . 
  the us wins most golds in olympics so they are the fittest people ? 
   but i think we should be proud that we 're ones of the very few that reduced their emmissions in the last 25years . 
  because we have outsourced all our manufacturing to other countries ? 
  it 's easy to cut your emissions when you move your pollution abroad . 
  china manages to put out less co2 per capita than eu , even when we have outsourced all out manufacturing to them . 
  i guess it 's good for the globe that not all western comforts are available to everybody in china . 
   that story also illustrates why some countries grind their teeth yet build nuclear power plants with rosatom . 
  including finland . 
  the planned next reactor comes from russia . 
  is agent 47 in the bell tower ? 
   is there any european phone manufacturers left out there anymore [ hmd ] ( http://www.hmdglobal.com/ ) ? 
  well , it still employs over 50 000 people , so it did n't quite vanish . 
  but sure , a lot of * it * vanished . 
  with all the money , norway could n't hire a better trump ?

  land of the free !, 
  question : do i need to buy a big truck now ? 
  what was the official reason given by the government ? 
  it ca n't be the ` crowded prisons ' , now can it ? 
  i do n't know how unusual that is . 
  i see stickers like that all the time . 
  yeah , in finland it 's very straightforward . 
  as the old military saying goes : * `` if the enemy does n't come from the east , it 's flanking . 
  all finns know to avoid thin ice because of [ this traumatic horror show ] ( https://youtu.be/rw_etnfujeo ) . 
   analcunt that 's a [ fine band ] ( https://youtu.be/dukfbgp4p-4 ) , not to be confused with nigel farage . 
  i wonder [ why it doesn ' work ] ( https://twitter.com/vsaksi/status/819505235085459456 ) . 
  but which one of them more insufferable ? 
  [ sure ] ( http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ ) . 
  one of [ these ] ( http://www.viinarannasta.ee/images-shop/1324970953-saaremaa80_10x50clpet_uus.jpg ) is quite enough . 
  well , finland does have a huge artillery , the biggest one in europe . 
  sometimes it has been mocked as a relic of days gone by and i have no idea whether it has any place in a modern war . 
  but the contrast is quite huge , with finland having hunderds of cannons while sweden has something like a dozen . 
  what , you pay $ 120 per month for your phone ? 
  i would have to get two new phones and two unlimited plans to reach that . 
  ( just checked my carrier 's site : a two-year plan with unlimited everything and a samsung galaxy s7 would cost 52 $ ), 
  i 'm not quite sure how you decide which one is ` first ' . 
  for example in finland , they are already building a test network in oulu . 
  also , sonera and nokia announced that they are going to launch a commercial 5g network in helsinki in 2018 [ ( in finnish ) ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9324136 ) . 
  but maybe they do n't qualify for this ` geographical ' rollout .
