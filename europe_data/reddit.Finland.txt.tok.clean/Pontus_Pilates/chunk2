  good thing russians do n't allow any alcohol : that 's why there are no drunk drivers in russia . 
  or among the russian truck drivers barreling down finnish highways . 
  finland is certainly no denmark , but cycling is quite popular here . 
  not necessarily in the sort of ` look at me , i 've got a pair of moustache and a fixie ' way , but more utilitarian . 
  people bike to work and school . 
  in helsinki , public transportation works so well that winter biking is n't quite as popular , but in other parts of the country , it 's pertty much [ the norm ] ( http://bikelanes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/granniesonbikes.jpg ) . 
  are you sure there 's a bail system in denmark ? 
  i guess they do . 
  they even sold russian cheese with [ the finnish flag ] ( http://is13.snstatic.fi/img/468/1433640561137.jpg ) on it to lure customers . 
  i mean , manufacturing fake finnish cheese is pretty hardcore . 
  i know the [ buyer ] ( http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54e652f6e4b021b682b6d4d1/t/54f10de8e4b079e94c234872/1425083881022/asterixswitzerland ) . 
  we are already alcoholics , our casinos are owned by the government ( aka . 
  the people ) . 
  how could a few thousand libyans make it better ? 
  [ i mean ] ( http://www.thebrandingjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/thursday_packaging_creative_design_chewing_gum_12.jpg ) . 
  [ chewing gum in finland ] ( http://www.kauppahalli24.fi/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/3/1368.jpg ), 
  apart from the obvious wwii invasion , there are several unpleasant russian periods in finnish history . 
  maybe the most famous is known in finland as ' [ the great wrath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_during_the_great_northern_war ) ' in 1700 's , where roaming cossacks would rape and pillage and generally terrorize the civilian population . 
  thousands were killed and thousands sold to slavery , several towns burned to ground . 
  suck it you small englishmen !, 
  hmm . 
  maybe they use a different definition for forests ? 
  i do n't know . 
  but just because it 's on wikipedia , does ' t mean it 's * the * definitive answer . 
  if we have to choose between finnish memes , i guess spurdo sp\u00e4rde is better than [ him ] ( http://meemi.info/images/6/6e/rumahuoraenpanis.jpg ) . 
  source : [ world bank 2012 data ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ag.lnd.frst.zs/countries/all?display=default ), 
  nice snare drum artillery they 've got in ukraine . 
  i would n't want to bike if i could n't see the ground . 
  then again , falling down would n't hurt nearly as much . 
  do nordic countries need to annex tallinn in order to protect its scandinavian population ? 
  i find the lithuanian way of pronouncing names fascinating/endearing . 
  just recently , finland was playing lithuania in basketball and carl lindbom became carlos . 
  it 's like modern swedish , but instead of all the english , they infuse theirs with finnish . 
   well call it `` miukumauku '' or did in 1998 , back when people still said the * http : / / * when reciting a web adress . 
  today it 's * \u00e4t * . 
   most of them were actually made in italy , not us oddly enough as far as i know , no donald duck cartoon is published in the us and the production mostly happens in europe . 
   you know it may sound childish , but my first contact with kalevala was through don rosa scrooge mc duck adventure . 
  not childish at all . 
  don rosa is super popular in finland ; whenever he shows up at a bookstore [ to sign autographs ] ( http://crop.kaleva.fi/8s13s1j3yaji03vee940vcagrlm=/894x0/smart/http%3a//kuvat.kaleva.fi/default/2035a1ac-2a2c-11e1-89c7-12314303c108/xlarge-20100922-100922don_rosa.jpg ) , there are hundreds of people lining up . 
  here 's [ akseli gallen-kallela ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/gallen-kallela_the_defence_of_the_sampo.png ) , here 's [ don rosa ] ( https://mantichore.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/sammon01.jpg ) and here 's the beloved finnish cartoonist [ mauri kunnas ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xviaem2wz7g/u_dyhwz8hci/aaaaaaaaahc/l6vu0svlzxs/s1600/img_5303.jpg ) . 
  well , we 've got the whole [ kalevala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevala ) thing . 
  plenty of stuff in there , starting from the creation of world . 
  there 's the [ old horndog ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/gallen_kallela_the_aino_triptych.jpg ) and the girl who would rather drown herself than marry him . 
  there 's the [ blacksmith ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/gallen_kallela_the_forging_of_the_sampo.jpg ) who 's unlucky in love and willing to do anything to get a fair maiden , even crafting one from gold . 
  or the young hero who wants to kill [ the black swan of the underworld ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/gallen_kallela_lemminkainens_mother.jpg ) , only for his mother having to come find him , piece him together and ask for the gods to bring him back to life . 
  and also the [ boy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/gallen_kallela_kullervos_curse.jpg ) who thinks his family is dead , only to unknowingly sleep with his sister who proceeds to kill herself . 
  mainly happy stuff . 
  while i agree that * tiitisen lista * is very much in the wheelhouse , there does n't seem to be any actual consiracy theory , just guesswork as who might have co-operated with stasi . 
   his only problem would be a revolution at home . 
  this isnt going to happen . 
      so while russia might go to shit soon , why should putin even be worried ? 
  because his power is based on his seeming omnipotence . 
  it 's pretty clear that there are n't that many clubs in his bag anymore and sooner or later it 's going to end . 
  he might control the media , but russians are not idiots . 
  if things do n't improve , either the people revolt or some of his political allies will turn on him . 
  the bodies have not been lifted out of the wreck , so it is designated as a gravesite and disturbing it is illegal . 
  so yeah , it 's illegal for civilians to make diving trips to estonia . 
  not illegal for authorities to investigate it , should a need arise . 
  just like police can open up a grave if they have to , but it is illegal for you to start digging up a cemetery . 
  but what about the [ helsinki syndrome ] ( https://youtu.be/x7vhiz1v7fs?t=54s ) ? 
  one of the more visible ones around the baltic is the sinking of ms estonia . 
  the accident created some real old-school [ conspiracy theories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia#conspiracy_theories ) . 
   the underlying issue is much worse of course it 's not . 
  i agree that funding terrorism is wrong . 
  however , we are talking about a handful of individuals who receive social security benefits . 
  it 's not like isis is depending on kela funds . 
  if we want to do something about the problem , then maybe pass a law where the benefits are cut if we find out somebody has joined a terrorist organization . 
  not some cyberpunk dystopia that stasi only dreamed about . 
  maybe this will be enough for you ? 
  a few things i gleaned through google transate : the 45 second number is n't mentioned in the article . 
  it merely tells us that on average , a rape is reported every 40 minutes . 
  and that usually , only one in ten rapes is reported . 
  also , the article does n't state that the number of rapes is going up , only the number of reports . 
  it could reflect increase in number of rapes or changing culture in repoting them . 
  oh , it 's a member of the lovely * the finns * party . 
  who could have guessed ? 
  also , he 's not a member of parliament , just some regular loonie in local governance . 
  if they ca n't handle kurds , a people with no resources , just a will to fight , i 'm * sure * they 'll defeat the billion people of india . 
  or nato . 
  or iran . 
  in finland , 100 % of the population knows the most important words in russian : * ruki vverh !, 
  i do n't about sweden , but here in finland the choise of true warrior is * [ kilju ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilju ) * . 
  all you need is a bucket , some water , a pack of sugar and some yeast . 
  give it some time and the [ appetizing drink is ready for consumption ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dmkigfitm2c/ul8ihs04t3i/aaaaaaaaafo/hj4hpaxwhom/s1600/03122012427.jpg ) . 
  how about non-alcoholic beers ? 
  my friend visited spain and told that the san miguel 0,0 was all the rage . 
  in finnish , there 's also the term ` kalja ' , which does n't seem to have any obvious relative on this map . 
  and what a theme song . 
  i do n't know , i feel like culturally finland is closer to sweden . 
  half a millennium of being part of sweden would do that . 
  well , they offer you protection and support . 
  and if nobody 's a part of the union , there 's no collective negotiating power . 
  and in case on unemployment , the union usually pays you better benefits than you 'd otherwise get . 
  and yes , you need to pay dues . 
  you can , although most employers will abide by the union minimums , even if you are not a member . 
  they do n't even attempt to give any source . 
  also , the definition of cartoon is very loose . 
  sure , tintin is a cartoon , but pinocchio and pippi l\u00e5ngstrump characters from children 's novels . 
  wallace and gromit are clay . 
  groke is n't even the most popular moomin character .
