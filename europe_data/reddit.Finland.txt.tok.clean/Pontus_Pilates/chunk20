  * people do n't like the same things i do n't like so they are wrong !, 
  or parents with working car batteries . 
  i do n't think the kids get to decide . 
  by the way , there are n't ` snow days ' in finland , but the weather * can * affect schools . 
  there 's a news clip from 1999 when the record cold for finland ( -51,5 c ) was measured . 
  the narrator tells us that the town of inari is quieter than usual , and only one third of pupils showed up at the elementary school . 
  only -18 in helsinki , but still rather cold biking home from work , especially crossing a bridge where the wind blew from the baltic . 
  that is quite a lot . 
  i though train tickets in finland were quite expensive , but i did a comparison search and a ticket from helsinki to oulu ( 600 km ) would cost me 56 euros , or 30 euros if i bought two weeks in advance . 
  he believes he 's merely a * gear * in a big divine machine . 
  the main market square of poland, 
  the savages misspelled [ perkele ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ykzkg2b.png ) . 
  the ` link ' is rather weak . 
  people tend to mellow out with age . 
  if 80-year-olds were just as dangerous as 40-year-olds , would n't we seem them commit murders at a similar rate as younger men ? 
  society does n't get anything out of revenge . 
  for society at large , the best punishment is as short as possible while still achieving some degree of rehabilitation . 
  finland has very short sentences and it might not be popular among victims , but on population level , it actually works quite well . 
  money is not spent to keep people locked in and some of those released might actually contribute by paying taxes . 
  [ another one ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/978/7ad92bc19bd94d7c994dff06e318037e.jpg ) . 
  i remember reading that suicide statistics in catholic countries might not be that reliable as it is such a taboo . 
  if possible , those deaths are marked up as accidents . 
  but i do n't know , might be bullshit . 
  to commemorate st. lucia 's italian origins , she 's holding a massive pile of spaghetti . 
   when the could be learning something useful is n't right . 
  not having hiv or unwanted kids can be rather useful in later life . 
  i disagree completely . 
  better make sure the kids know the very basics about sex , regardless of their parents . 
  and i think it 's valuable to know about religions , whether you believe in a deity or not . 
  too bad he 's a [ coca-cola santa ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/punf3eerkjg/maxresdefault.jpg ) like the rest of them these days . 
  well , at least he actually pops in to give the gifts and to talk to kids instead of just leaving them in the middle of the night . 
  the thing is , some years ago we did lower the alcohol tax to combat estonian imports . 
  and were immediately rewarded by ugly health statistics . 
  to some extent , high taxation is keeping us alive . 
  it 's friday night , your mate calls you asks you to come over , he has sauna heating up . 
  and you answer , `` sure , i 'll be right over , i 'll just swing by tallinn to grab a few beers . '', 
  can any romanians give context to this : is he really a big name ? 
  an influential figure ? 
  the taste of vana tallinn should make anyone put down the bottle for a few months . 
  why does n't sauli carry a jatimatic ? 
   calling all of those parties far right which the chart did n't do . 
  [ jutta urpilainen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jutta_urpilainen ) used to be the finance minister of finland . 
  for whatever reason , someone got [ this tattoo of her ] ( https://mesikammen.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ssjutta.jpg ) . 
  sure . 
  and how does that make the graph invalid ? 
   the far left of denmark is a lot more scary and threatens my personal freedom than the supposed far right . 
  and what does this have to do with the nyt graph ? 
  you oppose the labeling of right-wing parties because you do n't like the left ? 
  * leave the racists alone , the left is bad too !, 
  just because there are n't strictly defined criteria for political ideologies does n't mean that you ca n't evaluate parties and put them in some sort of categories . 
  there is n't a well-defined height where a person is considered tall , but that does n't mean that there are n't tall and short people . 
  i find it hard to believe that we would be slimmer than our neighbours . 
  is n't it because you can only drive 40 km/h on your highways ? 
  did you have some actual criticism or did you find factual errors ? 
  or do those things even matter these days ? 
  as long as you avoid the anomalies . 
  interestingly , the finnish word for sweden , * ruotsi * , comes from the same root - [ the rus ' people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus%27_people ) , or people who row . 
  well , you did beat us in actual prosperity . 
  but we both beat sweden , high five !, 
  can any latvian give the basics ? 
  do we just add ` as ' at the end of our names we are set to go ? 
  they still have the nk sign up . 
  that 's straight from the old testament ( deuteronomy 22:28 -29 ) :  if a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered , he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver . 
  he must marry the young woman , for he has violated her . 
  he can never divorce her as long as he lives . 
  i believe it used to be quite a bit higher in finland . 
  now it 's just a bunch of assholes like me who only speak english and some bad swedish . 
  it 's not so much the age , it 's that the girls have no choice and no way to pursue their own life . 
   are we obliged to judge them and say what is right and what is wrong ? 
  yes . 
  those girls should be able to decide for themselves . 
  we , as europeans , should n't support forced marriages and child brides . 
   imho every culture can and should make their own customs in their own territories , and noone should judge them . 
  cultural relativism should only be engaged with great care . 
  he must be fun at parties . 
   16 belgium -- as well as being as the headquarters of the eu and nato , belgium is ranked as one of the best-governed countries on earth . 
  it functions under a federal political system , whereby regions have significant powers . 
  was n't belgian government supposed to be some grand shitshow ? 
  eastern finland used to lead these charts , but then a [ 27-year-old doctor was sent there to fix diets ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/finlands-radical-heart-health-transformation/389766/ ) . 
  and quite miraculously , succeeded . 
  maybe you should do like the finns and start collecting [ the mugs ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hpw7ekuo7hw/uwqtbszj0ci/aaaaaaaaasc/ransutmlb4s/s1600/dscn3236.jpg ) . 
  it really is a pretty place . 
  of course , there are the usual downsides of a tourist destiantion : a lot of people milling around and every other storefront selling plush moose and ` viking ' helmets . 
  * ** mainly concerns items found in british museums . 
  the sanctions also led to russian producers [ slapping finnish flags and other finland-branding ] ( https://images.kauppalehti.fi/1024x/http://content.kauppalehti.fi/news-images/2015/12/2015124335339.jpg ) on their products . 
  i guess the finnish cheese brand is quite strong . 
  finland has a taller bar , finland wins ? 
  so sorry , reval . 
  my bad . 
  helsinki-tallin high five !, 
  [ as long as there 's beer ... ] ( https://media.riemurasia.net/albumit/mmedia/g1/sb8/edg/176995/942211614.gif ), 
   are they really a stable presence though ? 
  yes . 
  they are a sovereign country with borders , an economy , a regime you can talk to . 
  the americans hawks ( and maybe you ) are itching to bomb the place , tear it apart like they did with iraq . 
  compared to that sort of chaos , iran is remarkably stable and stabilizing force in the middle east . 
  so , piraeus has two ports that combined would be no . 
  but for some reason they are counted separately . 
  because iran is a stable presence in the middle east showing timid signs of moderation and liberation ? 
  the last thing we need is for the us and israel start bombing iran , tearing it apart and creating a bigger syria .
