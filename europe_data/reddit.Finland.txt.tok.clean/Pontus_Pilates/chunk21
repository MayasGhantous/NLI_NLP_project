  i automatically started whistling the [ scorpions ] ( https://youtu.be/n4rjjkxsamq ) . 
  skins for foreskins . 
  [ makkaraperunat ] ( http://www.turkulainen.fi/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/2801makkpekkhalistupa1.jpg?itok=qabhrlkf ) all the way . 
  yeah , you are making my point . 
  that link clearly states that organic foods do not appear to be any healthier than conventionally farmed products . 
  thanks , i guess . 
   okay , but what 's wrong with industrial nitrogen ? 
  literally nothing . 
  but labelling things ` natural ' let 's you charge more for them . 
  fast food has nothing to do with farming techniques . 
  you can make an organic bun and a conventional bun . 
  they have the exact same nutritional content . 
  the other one just takes 30 % land to produce . 
  [ the baltic right now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j8qj6uw.jpg ) . 
  so , do you think that organic crops magically grow without nitrogen or phosphorous ? 
  the plants need those to grow and they need to be delivered in some way . 
  no matter the source of nitrogen , it still ends up in the soil , and if not careful , to waterways . 
  and glyphosate have been studied a * lot * and has not been shown to be harmful to humans . 
  sure , i 'd rather we not use any chemicals , but at some point we need to actually feed the people . 
  i 'm sure there are several definitions , certifications etc. 
  but the most basic aspect is that they get their nitrogen from natural sources ( cow dung ) and that the pesticides are also derived from nature . 
   sure but it is often in conjunction with local markets and responsible farming . 
  most organic food distributions try to source locally and often bring more money to the farmers . 
  are there some sources for this claim ? 
  i would assume that by volume , most organic farming goes towards the organic foodstuff you can buy from supermarkets . 
  and that 's done by the same big farmers and companies who also do conventional farming . 
  i have nothing against local and sustainable food production , but there 's no reason that has to be organic . 
  remember people , organic farming is n't inherently good . 
  it takes up much more land for same amount of food than conventional farming , offers no health benefits and is n't necessarily better for nature . 
  when pesticides and fertilizers have to be ` natural ' , it mainly means that they are less effective and need to be used more . 
  if we are going to feed the whole globe , organic farming is the last thing we should be doing . 
  on the other side , companies can charge more for their tomatoes . 
   the bigger issue for russian economy is oil and gas prices the biggest issues are endemic corruption and lack of diversity . 
  as great of accomplisment as russians have done in the fields of technology and science over the decades , it has all been thrown away . 
  russia does n't really sell anything besides fossil fuels and weapons . 
  and with sanctions in place , it 's even harder to sell anything or get investments . 
  if only the trillion dollars stolen from the russian economy by the oligarchy had been invested in education and infrastructure . 
  well , i of course do n't personally know the situation that well , but listening to foreign policy experts , lifting the sanctions and getting rid of the magnitsky act is the no . 
  1 goal of russia 's us relationships . 
  that 's what the infamous trump jr. meeting was about , that 's what the trump-putin g20 meeting was about . 
  the other sanctions might be tough too , but the magnitsky act makes it personal . 
  why steal hundreds of millions if you ca n't move the money around and travel freely ? 
  the oligarchs do n't want to park their money in russia -- what if people overthrew them ? 
  no , they want to keep it abroad and us meddling is making it increasingly difficult . 
  from what i understand , the sanctions do indeed hurt the elite and that 's why they are so desperate to get rid of them . 
  that was the central tenant in helping trump get elected : russian thought he might lift the sanctions . 
  or be more understanding in the `` adoption issue '' . 
  if an oligarch ca n't open a bank account outside of russia or travel to the us , it does n't hurt the ordinary people . 
  i 'm just trying to get the order of events right : the article speaks that finland attacked russia with the support from the warmongerers . 
  while britain and france did support finland to some extent , it was only after soviet union had already invaded . 
  so i do n't know how they were supposed to be these warmongerers * before * the war . 
  do you really see life that way ? 
  that it 's okay to do horrible things as long as you do some good every once in a while ? 
  i 'm not saying you should personally apologise for what the british empire did to people in asia , africa , america - well , everywhere - but claiming that if those people want any sympathy , they should first thank * you * for isaac newton and beatles sounds a bit weird . 
   this calls for a diplomatic response on finland 's part , in my opinion . 
  this can not go without correction . 
  yeah , perhaps . 
  then they 'll say it was a mistake , maybe change a few sentences . 
  but what difference does any of this make for us finns ? 
  ` quite a bit ' as in [ growing by less than 1 % ] ( http://marketrealist.com/2017/05/russias-gdp-is-back-to-positive-territory/ ) after [ losing half of its gdp in three years ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd?locations=ru ) . 
  russia has [ these ] ( https://youtu.be/iyryaiam2-c ) nowadays . 
  i 'm not necessarily bothered or insulted if russians want to lie to each other . 
  i guess the people writing this and plenty of their readers know that this is n't true , but are willing to go along for the sake of russia . 
  i 'm mainly sad about the current state of russia and how the oligarchy 's struggle to keep absolute power is hurting the regular people . 
  we had such hopes for the post-soviet russia , singing some scoprions and thinking it would all get better . 
  and for a while it really did look like russia would get prosperous and free . 
  the oil money is disappearing , the economy is crashing and the only thing seemingly holding it together is blatant lying . 
  yeah , it 's the problem with the brits : they 've done quite a lot of stuff . 
  but they ca n't really issue a formal apology for any of it , as they would be saying ` sorry ' until the sun goes out . 
  yeah , but not pre-war . 
  i guess the three for finland is technically correct , but really , it 's only halonen . 
  j\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki won the election and was thrown out right away , kiviniemi only served for a bit after vanhanen went after that private sector money . 
  she 's gone on holiday with ian mckellen ? 
  the elite and their celebrity friends . 
   i 'd die before i even reach the border . 
  i mean , you would n't need to bike from russia to finland . 
  just put your bike on a train to helsinki . 
  take your bike . 
  the little islands with ferry service in between makes for a popular cycling destination . 
  i saw him a good decade ago in helsinki , riding in the back of a bmw . 
  i wonder when he 'll switch to an audi . 
  the new one has some decent interiors too : [ 1 ] ( https://synblogi.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/somerpuro-elo-2012-25.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.libraries.fi/sites/default/files/buildings/kaisa-017.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://karusellissa.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/0809-100912-pokkari-003.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://blogs.helsinki.fi/wdc-2012/files/2012/05/kaisa4_veikkosomerpuro.jpg ) . 
  but have you heard of [ finnish food ] ( https://www.kotikokki.net/media/cache/large/recipeimage/large/52d6deffd074a9ec0e09cdb1/original.jpg?1297683082 ) ? 
  i can tell you , living in a country where it 's possible to look up someone 's income , i have no interest to do that . 
  once it 's open and accessible , it loses all of the mystique and you just do n't care . 
  it 's like taking up smoking after you 've turned 18 ; sure , you can now do it easily and openly , but what 's the point ? 
  i 've never done it and i do n't know if anybody does . 
  and there we arrive at the secret of finland 's dominance : lactose free products . 
  15-20 % of finns ca n't handle lactose , so our dairy companies have developed lactose free products that taste basically the same as the real thing . 
  and stores are [ full of that ` laktoositon ' stuff ] ( http://verkkouutisetfi.s3.amazonaws.com/ab8ca387343df7342e1ad7463b2cd4c10c58424672a8598f7088e577622b9cf5 ) . 
  it 's the same bus except for the front panel and hubcaps . 
  from what i understand , finland is one of the rare countries where it 's common for adults to drink milk with their meals . 
  the thing is , finns do n't thank each other for their service . 
  we have universal male conscription and about 80 % of male population has been in the army . 
  as a result , everybody has been there and there 's no point in supporting the troops etc. 
  i quite like to think what would happen if soldiers were [ trotted out in random sporting events ] ( https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/283626706/1024x576/cut.jpg ) in finland . 
  probably a lot of jeering and reminding the lads of all the mornings they have left . 
  [ tank you netherlands !, 
  coliseum represent a better sight . 
  a better place to take pictures .
