  the forum might be more interesting , but it 's not a single thing . 
  a friend of mine visited a shooting range in texas , mentioned that he had been in the finnish army and the texans thanked him for his service .

  yeah , but you found it insightful enough to post it . 
   making it illegal for unidentified military groups to cross the border and conduct activities in finland how was this not illegal already ? 
  does anyone have an idea if these people decide : * `` let 's be evil !, 
  '' * or do they genuinely think that they are helping someone and improving their country ?

  i will never understand how denmark produced michael rasmussen . 
  i do n't think there are logical reasons to oppose polygamy in principle . 
  * if * a collection of people want to spend their time together in a relationship , that 's fine by me . 
  if three men and and two women * willingly * want to form some kind of supermarriage , why not ? 
  the legal status might be complicated , should one member die or divorce . 
  however , there 's very little push for polygamy in europe . 
  mainly because people do n't seem to want to enter such relationships willingly . 
  as for incest , there 's even smaller push for that kind of thing , but it also produces children with such severe conditions that it 's not fair for the offspring .

  when estonia joined the eu in 2004 , finland lowered alcohol taxation by about 30 % to combat alcohol tourism . 
  it led to a sharp spike in alcohol-related deaths and illnesses . 
  saw chinese tourists today in helsinki and i felt bad for them . 
  the city is empty and everything is closed due to midsummer and the temperatures barely crack double digits . 
  stay on the coast and you 'll be just fine . 
  havent 's seen a single mosquito in helsinki this year . 
  the temperature record for finland is 37 \u00b0 c , so anything beyond 30 is unusual . 
  i have a windows phone ( as one does ) it sometimes lowers the volume by itself and shows a warning message on the screen .

  the bugle had some absolute classics , but then again , he had andy zaltzman to run the show . 
  and it was more joyful anf juvenile satire and quite british , not just ideological pandering to a very specific american audience .

  so are you one of those people who is a right-winger , but consider yourself to be a sensible centrist and see everything left of kokoomus as a bunch of leninists ?

  oh , so you are one of * those * people rooting for a more ` objective ' media when the facts or the majority opinion does n't align with yours .

  yeah , i think your bitterness towards the media does n't alter the fact that halla-aho is deeply unlikable and creepy . 
  there certainly are people who support his racial theories and are free to do so , but that does n't mean halla-aho has any hope of gathering wider support . 
  no matter what the media does or does n't do . 
  if only one could lead a party solely through facebook postings . 
  great for finland . 
  he has no charisma and wo n't draw in regular voters like soini did . 
  persut can now become a full-time racist party with tiny support .

  that 's a good story , but not entirely true :  honda uses the nameplate `` jazz '' in europe , oceania , the middle east , africa , and most parts of asia . 
  it used the name `` fit '' in japan , china , and the americas . 
  or maybe one could use the money to invest in something more viable ? 
  there are other possiblities besides just jerking off to elon musk and not doing anything . 
   as a proof of concept there are pneumatic systems to carry banknotes capsules in many supermarkets here .

  then again , there 's very little concern about the comfort and safety of aspirin . 
  and it does n't have to travel at the speed of sound . 
  i do n't know if it scales in such a straightforward way . 
   but the cost per mile of a modern highspeed railway is also extremely high . 
  sure , but the rails are relatively maintenance-free once laid down . 
  a 1000 km long vacuum tube that needs to have very high tolerances is a whole another matter . 
  not only does it need to be very straight , it also needs to stay sealed and requires a lot of energy to maintain a vacuum so huge .
