  also , i assume the tickets are going to cost an arm and a leg . 
  a train can transport 400 people at a time . 
  a hyperloop capsule maybe 20 , perhaps 40 ? 
  how many of those capsules can simultaneusly be in one tube ? 
  i read [ the article ] ( http://time.com/4793913/finding-home-estonia-where-the-heart-is/ ) and nowhere did it describe estonia as anything else than generous and welcoming . 
  it 's not really estonia 's fault that their climate and culture do n't please people from the middle east . 
  and in this case people who have been sold an impossible dream of europe . 
  i will remain sceptical of this whole concept . 
  i guess people smarter than me are convinced that it might work , but to me it seems very impractical . 
  well , at least the dutch have a 30 metre low-speed version of it . 
  well , in finland , lidl seems to be disproportionately popular among the immigrant population . 
  finnish people would rather buy finnish products - lidl has even made some self-deprecating ads about the finnish aversion to a german grocery store - but immigrants do n't have a desire to pay premium for finnish cookies . 
  the first lady is making slovenia great again . 
  \u010covfefe . 
  years ago , when there was a cold spell in finland , i was a visiting a friend when his father came barging in , declaring : * `` well now it 's cold outside !, 
  i went to lidl and not a single negro there . 
  grocery stores can sell the swedish folk\u00f6l , but it 's a rather weak beer . 
  some years ago , the centre party in finland proposed a similar policy , moving down from the current 4,7 % drinks available in stores to something starting with a three . 
  then they realized that voters would revolt and did a 180 , starting a push for even stronger drinks . 
  now that seems to be fizzling out , as the government ca n't seem to agree on anything . 
  kazakhstan only like big dicks !, 
  other countries are run by little girls . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonians ) , over twice as many estonians live in finland than in russia . 
  so as / u/giveme50dollars said , they are probably ethnic russians . 
  looks like he 's wiping sweat off jesus 's holy forehead . 
   but it ca n't possibly be that one . 
  well , obviously not . 
  florida is on level with north africa . 
  how 's the heating bill ? 
  so , we spend more than the dutch and make far less . 
  i 'm not sure who wins this round , but i suspect it is n't us . 
  yeah , it 's in [ florida ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._petersburg,_florida ), 
  i really only know the board game alhambra . 
  a decent game that one . 
  the yellow state . 
  always knew the germans were lazy . 
  as with any scientific discovery about to change our entire understanding of a subject , i 'd pump the breaks and see what other people in the field have to say . 
  the [ skull fragments have apparently been found during wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graecopithecus ) , so it 's definitely not a new discovery . 
  it might turn out to be true , but i 'd use healthy scepticism with news like this . 
  is [ the tattoo ] ( https://k3.okccdn.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/150x150/558x800/170x166/703x699/0/10768486282844512369.jpeg?v=1 ) satire ? 
  yeah , it 's sort of true . 
  they were in poland . 
  i would n't call paris a german city . 
  if scotland gained independence , would they then use the british pound ? 
  a scottish pound ? 
  yeah , countries with death sentence always have lower crime rates . 
  you 're right . 
  url ending in ) causes problems with formatting . 
  too bad it is n't he older missile with nato name ` satan ' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r-36_ ( missile ) . 
  i feel this is the wrong venue to try to make the * `` this is for de people who makes a real music !, 
  '' * argument . 
  come on , it 's a festival for cheesy pop . 
  be happy that you won , but do n't try to put yourself above the other performers . 
  at least spain has zero . 
  this is actually pretty cool . 
  if only they sang in ukrainian . 
  oh god , i hate this . 
  spain , this is why your economy is tanking . 
  the finnish announcer called him the ` epic sex guy ' . 
  is n't germany usually providing some middle-aged comedy moment ? 
  that 's a nice statue , i 'll give it : & # 9733 ; & # 9733 ; & # 9733 ; & # 9734 ; & # 9734 ;, 
  should n't we use a 24h clock over at r/europe ? 
  no , you would have just found the joy of department store catalgoues . 
  that 's an excellent place to spy on your neighbours . 
  on the plus side , the anti-eu party in finland is in a death-spiral . 
  so it 's not all bad . 
  in hockey , we win often enough that i do n't really care if we lose to smaller nations . 
  i kind of root for them . 
  losing to sweden or canada , well that 's a whole another matter . 
  one turning point for europe might have been the reaction to the stolen documents and the amused dismissal of the russian effort . 
  if we can only brush off the gru meddling with such ease in the future , we 'll much better off . 
   teeme \u00c4ra ( `` let 's do it '' ) follows the estonian tradition of talgud , a common effort to get a major task done . 
  the term is difficult to translate no it 's not . 
  the translation is * talkoot * . 
   whatever the process by which the documents were acquired , they need to be examined and considered by the public , granted that they are legitimate and not forged . 
  that 's not right . 
  people have a right to privacy . 
  if someone were to gain access to my very boring gmail account , there is no public need to examine its contents . 
  just because information is available does n't mean it needs to be distributed publicly . 
  if you find someone 's diary , you do n't have a moral obligation to read it aloud and tell strangers about its contents . 
  the same goes with politicians : their correspondence is private and should be left that way . 
  if there 's a suspicion of real wrongdoing , then the authorities can find a way to legally access such information and decide which parts are relevant for the public . 
  i was expecting france to have a bigger agricultural sector . 
  do n't worry steve , [ kyrgyzstan still loves you ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bsvj8ci.jpg ) . 
  looking at the legend , i was first confused as to why the lithuanian word came from old irish . 
  this one of those things that you get used to , desensitized . 
  but when you stop to think about it , it 's completely insane .

  it would be cooler if kiss was n't literally the lamest thing on this earth . 
  pretty fierce terrorism in finland . 
  according to the source , one person was injured in a mugging . 
  other countries might have wind , solar or hydro power , but we have a * commitment !, 
  i do n't know if they are bad . 
  but offering free studies might be a good way to lure smart and motivated people to your country . 
  getting them to stay after the studies is another matter . 
  maybe so . 
  but they seem to support a worldview from the middle age . 
  so even if they are peaceful , they are still in direct conflict with european values .
