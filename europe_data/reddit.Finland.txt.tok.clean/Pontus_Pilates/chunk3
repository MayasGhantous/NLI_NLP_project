  never read those comics , although they look extremely familiar as libraries were filled with them . 
  along with corto maltese . 
   in samara on tuesday the first batch of products that fell under the import embargo are being destroyed . 
  those pork products have been detained since april . 
  a highly controversial decision to destroy three-month-old pork products . 
  if you could opt out of the service with no consequences , the current model would collapse . 
  then again , the 420 people and conspiracy theorists will tell you that the * real corruption * is higher up and the whole police force is rotten . 
  of course there 's no evidence for such a claim , but that never stopped anybody . 
   biggest is still ahead of us the biggest and the most pretentious . 
  13 $ organic beers , hitlerjugend haircuts and ironic sweaters . 
  there 's apparently no quality of life found in this barren wasteland . 
  time to build another [ golf course ] ( http://hitsharenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/a99205_borders-sweden-finland.jpg ) . 
  living in switzerland has its drawbacks , but the flag is a big plus . 
  yeah , it 's fine . 
  i would personally just delete the post and move on . 
  how does one even post something like this ? 
  it 's not even close to being true . 
  we could change to our [ presidential flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/presidential_standard_of_finland_%281920-1944_1946-1978%29.svg/1024px-presidential_standard_of_finland_%281920-1944_1946-1978%29.svg.png ) and cause all kinds of controversy and boycotts . 
  * `` why do you have a swastika on your flag ? 
  what 's the one in ukraine ? 
  that is quite neat . 
  i like how they did n't apparently know the coastlines that accurately and just made them squiggly . 
  or maybe it was just the style used in that peroid . 
  [ time lapse : the difference between summer and winter in finland ] ( https://youtu.be/ntjyt-6hjqw ), 
  what the hell sweden ? 
  thanks to climate change , finland is turning into iceland : +7 year-round , light rain . 
  how come finland is that low ? 
  are we running our vocational schools for nothing ? 
  well , sipil\u00e4 is wealthy , but does n't seem too flashy either . 
  although , he does have [ this car ] ( http://jalopnik.com/5792023/this-el-camino-runs-on-burning-wood ) . 
  he seems like a relatively low-key guy . 
  at least norway tried . 
  well , there is plenty of tunnels under helsinki . 
  according to [ wikipeda ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsingin_tunneliverkosto ) , over 200 km . 
  that should offer some space to hunt mutants . 
  there 's even a tunnel to suomenlinna . 
  of course we do , we are not savages . 
  by the way , today is the name day of aadolf , aatto and aatu . 
  happy name day to all adolfs !,

  :d hey now !, 
  independence day in finnish is the entirely reasonable and logical * itsen\u00e4isyysp\u00e4iv\u00e4 * . 
  that , right there , is a made-up word . 
  i think the shape is kind of neat , but the design is boring at best . 
  i 've bought frozen pizza from that very girl . 
  good thing i paid for my purchase . 
  yeah , i share the sentiment . 
  here in finland there 's plenty of branding and advertisement that is unnecessarily in english . 
  products that are clearly meant for the finnish market , yet they are given english names or even slogans . 
  i guess advertisers find it cool , i find it stupid . 
   what 's the definition of a startup ? 
  according to the source , they are tech companies founded after 2000 . 
  eurovision , uefa ... european enough . 
   some kind of non belligerent treaty do you think providing weapons is part of this same deal ? 
  is turkey supporting isis because they both hate the kurds ? 
  thanks . 
  i understand your sentiment , but let 's say the russian army makes a landing in denmark . 
  do you advocate becoming a part of russia ? 
  or maybe emptying denmark of danes ? 
  apparently there was a strong german culture in america ( newspapers , schools ) , but germans were heavily persecuted during the first world war . 
  as a consequence , most of that activity ceased , names were anglicized and the distinc german american culture more or less disappeared . 
  when they become radicalized , they are called tie fighters . 
  let 's not get carried away with the headlines , quartz . 
  the wi-fi is not citywide , rather there are hotspots in certain buildings , like libraries . 
  and it 's not that fast . 
  you may very well be better off using your 4g connection . 
   i mean , us moving to the us is pretty well known , but sweden ? 
  to be fair , people of german descent tend to keep a pretty low profile in the us too . 
  they are something like the largest ethnic group of us , yet you never hear of them the same way you hear about italian americans , irish americans or even polish americans . 
  i 've always thought that our simple plates ( three letters , three numbers ) are pretty cool . 
  they were even better [ before the eu tag ] ( http://koti.mbnet.fi/svc/kuvia/xantia/dsc01095.jpg ), 
  are the finns also to blame for the budget overrun ? 
   the original cost estimate for olkiluoto 3 was just over $ 3 billion . 
  areva said in late 2012 that the overall cost for olkiluoto 3 could end up closer to $ 8.5 billion . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/areva-offers-new-timeline-for-much-delayed-finnish-nuclear-reactor-project-1409534893 ), 
  okay . 
  that is achievement gap between genders . 
  i was talking more about equality between different wealth classes . 
  not saying it is not a problem , but a very different problem . 
   as i said , independence can be lost in myriad ways . 
  nato would prevent many such scenarios can you provide some examples ? 
  also , i 'm not sure i follow your logic . 
  you are saying that our government ordered a nuclear reactor from russia because they are in the pocket of moscow . 
  yet the very same government is eager to join nato , something moscow absolutely objects . 
  oh , my mistake . 
  i thought we were talking about nuclear reactors , not aircraft carriers . 
   do we prioritize trade with russia or our independence ? 
  again , there are no signs that russia would invade finland . 
  do you want to wreck the finnish economy just you can sit at the big boys ' table ? 
  okay . 
  is there any source for this ? 
   for example , why did the finnish government suddenly agree to buy a nuclear plant from russia , knowing all we know about russia ? 
  or was it because they can actually build a reactor , unlike the french ? 
  in this economic situation , do you support buiyng more of that amazing and affordable areva tech ? 
  i guess there are manufacturers in korea able to sell similar reactors , but i do n't have the competence to evaluate which option was the best . 
  and further , how does joining nato prevent russia from doing dick moves towards finland ? 
  as long as russia does n't outright invade , nato can do very little to help finland when it comes to russia . 
  if russia is mad about finland joining nato and decides to stop buying paper or machinery from finland , does stubb call washington and order an airstrike ? 
  russia has an endless bag of dick moves . 
  one of their favorite clubs is the trade bullshit : they can suddenly decide that finnish products do n't meet their standards and effectively stop all trade , shirinking the finnish economy even further .
