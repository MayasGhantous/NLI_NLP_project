  if a child can play with a tablet , yet does n't have a phone or a tv , does it really matter ? 
  i did n't have a cell phone or even internet connection growing up and i do n't think kids these days are any happier . 
  i 'm confused by the polish flag and the chicago restaurant . 
  is it in the illinois of poland ? 
  we even make fun of [ norwegian metal ] ( https://youtu.be/xoibixl3dlo ) . 
  also , there 's [ children 's metal ] ( https://youtu.be/vxhhlydysqq ) . 
  well , you ca n't always [ win ] ( http://www.worldoftomoffinland.com/tomsblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/76-21.jpg ) . 
  the [ vatican 2009 ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/shared/img/comm_2009_va_800.jpg ) is pretty cool . 
  as is the [ austrian 2005 ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/shared/img/comm_2005_at_800.jpg ) coin . 
  how is public transport and walkability in saudi cities ? 
  i quite like the finnish commemorative coin with the [ dove of peace in a puzzle ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/shared/img/comm_2005_fi_800.jpg ) . 
   is the heat unbearable ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  +25 is considered hot and it basically never goes over +30 . 
  heineken is not any better than finnish lagers . 
  it might even be worse than something like lapin kulta or sandels . 
  i do have pretty extensive knowledge on how to kill mutants in there . 
  if you are a chinese or an american tourist viewing ` europe ' as a big outdoor museum , full of ` history ' , i 'd avoid finland . 
  our sights are pretty shitty . 
  go to rome or prague . 
  otherwise , it 's quite lovely . 
  especially in summertime . 
  there are also [ these ] ( http://kaaoszine.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/postimerkit-2015.jpg ) rock stamps coming out . 
  sure , we were part of russia , but at least we still had karelia . 
  except warhammer only uses six-sided dice ... 
  this gives a nice overview of our mosquito factories . 
  seems to me it 's all about submarines . 
  ctrl + f * `` finland '' * , zero hits . 
  i wanted to see some tanks , but wikipedia tells me estonia does n't have mtb 's . 
  i want to see croatian tanks rolling in . 
  however many they can fit . 
  oh crap , estonia is overtaking us any day now . 
  oh well , it was a good run . 
  i 'm surprised finalnd is doing even that well . 
  it seems like nobody wants kids until they are 35 and then maybe just one . 
  it 's not so much population growth , rather the ability to maintain current economy while the big post-war generations retire . 
  is that $ 80 million given by the manufacturer ? 
  do american pay more than norwegians ? 
  here 's an article : [ how much does an f-35 actually cost ? 
  ] ( https://medium.com/war-is-boring/how-much-does-an-f-35-actually-cost-21f95d239398 )  a single air force f-35a costs a whopping $ 148 million . 
  one marine corps f-35b costs an unbelievable $ 251 million . 
  a lone navy f-35c costs a mind-boggling $ 337 million . 
  average the three models together , and a `` generic '' f-35 costs $ 178 million . 
    it gets worse . 
  these are just the production costs . 
  additional expenses for research , development , test and evaluation are not included . 
  the dollars are 2015 dollars . 
  this data was just released by the senate appropriations committee in its report for the pentagon 's 2015 appropriations bill . 
   russian gdp according to world bank is bigger than german . 
  $ 3,623 bln vs $ 3,539 bln . 
  those numbers are adjusted to purchasing power . 
  things are cheaper in russia . 
  if you look at raw gdp , germany 's is $ 3.7 trillon and russia 's $ 2.1 trillion . 
  norway is also buying the most expensive plane available . 
  i do n't know if there ever was much of the old stuff . 
  finland has been a poor and rural country through history . 
  because of our poor quality soil , much of the farming was done through [ slash-and-burn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slash-and-burn ) , a technique that is not very conducive to urbanization . 
  compared to rest of europe , finns moved to cities very late . 
  damn you sweden !, 
  everything in finland is so new that we really can not compete . 
  but a town like [ porvoo ] ( http://www.traveltop.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/moody-old-fish-barns-in-porvoo-finland.jpg ) can be quite charming . 
  [ even in winter ] ( http://www.visitporvoo.fi/easydata/customers/porvoonmatkailu2/files/taustakuvat/jokiranta_talvi1500x1001.jpg ) . 
  raivo means ` rage ' in finnish . 
  it is also the first name of raivo roosna , an estonian who gained some notoriety in finland after robbing a jewellery store back in the 80 's . 
   california is the most populous state and has 55 votes . 
  texas , another populous state has 38 . 
  iowa which is mostly rural and unpopulated has 6 . 
  yet the candidates spend all their time in iowa , ohio and new hampshire as they are the most important states . 
  new jersey has three times the population of iowa , yet chris christie [ wo n't sign a massively popular piece of legistlation as it might offend pig farmers in iowa ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/03/christie-vetoed-n-j-pigs-bill-to-charm-iowa-ahead-of-2016-critics-say/ ) . 
  does n't make much sense . 
  so you are claiming that one of america 's greatest strenghts is the fact that the presidential election is decided in a handful of small states and a big state like california is basically irrelevant ? 
  so ukip and greens got over 5 million votes and two mp 's , cameron and his chaps got 11.3 million votes and 331 seats . 
  yeah , does n't seem fair . 
  i 'm also wondering why the city of [ mikkeli ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/mikkelin_keskusta_naisvuorelta.jpg ) is n't represented . 
  i think it would be hilarious to see the uk passively-aggressively shouting over the channel : * never mind us , we are not part of your silly club . 
  can you hear us ? 
  we do n't want any part of you !, 
  not interested in the least . 
  yeah , we had the * true finns * party surge to an unprecedented number of seats a few years ago and the popularity of their admittedly charismatic leader was able to drag all sorts of village idiots to the parliament . 
  to be fair , they will be in the same government with national coalition , a party that would dissolve the finnish constitution if it meant closer ties with eu . 
  i do n't think this will affect finland 's approach to eu in any significat way . 
  what 's the most remarkable thing about that video is how quiet the tank seems to be . 
  or maybe it 's just far away and the microphone does n't pick up the ruckus . 
  come visit !, 
  it can be [ quite pretty ] ( https://youtu.be/46pm5v00mv4 ) . 
  yeah , that 's last year 's ranking . 
  the filthy norwegians slipped past us this year . 
  well , at least sweden is the weakest nordic country , as everybody knew all along . 
  in high scool , i remember reading * hurskas kurjuus * ( * meek heritage * in english ) by f.e. 
  sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 , our only nobel winner in literature . 
  it tells a story of a poor farmer born in the 19th century . 
  all of his life is some sort of suffering and the only moment of relief he experiences is when his children die . 
  in the end , the man is executed in the civil war . 
  [ happy finland ( pharrell williams & aki kaurism\u00e4ki ) ] ( https://youtu.be/hmbcjmo1rgk ), 
  mcdonald 's has been in finland since 1984 and made losses almost every year . 
  one would think that it does n't make any sense to stay 30 years in a hopeless market . 
  unless the parent company charges massive licensing fees that forces the subsidiary to channel its revenue abroad and by sheer accident avoid taxation .
