  otherwise it will all spill out when you do the trick . 
  the way i read it , the school choice paired with lax regulation leads to a situation where privately run schools try to attract students with non-educational features . 
  if you need to attract students to get funding , it might be more important to be a cool school than a good school . 
  if students have less choice , maybe the schools can concentrate more on education . 
  so , looking through wikipedia , the strenght of the irish army is given as 7500 men and the size of reserves just over 4000 . 
  is that really all ? 
  i mean , it 's not like anybody 's going to attack ireland , but still . 
  woke up in a tiny tent , went outside to pee and realized it sounded like the stream was hitting something . 
  i looked down in the darkness and i was pissing in someone 's helmet . 
  finished up , went back into the tent and kept my mouth shut . 
  a beer at a hockey game in finland will usually set you back something like 7 or 8 euros . 
  the article mentions prices of 3 euros in ostrava . 
  this picture was part of an article telling how cheap beer is at the games . 
  they interviewed a finnish tourist who claimed it is so cheap that you actually save money drinking it . 
  * `` the more you drink , the more you save . 
  well , if you want to form your own opinion , here 's the sort of ramblings the man gives : https://www.facebook.com/peter.iiskola/posts/547443648701742 he starts out with a real bang , saying he wants to abandon his finnish citizenship . 
  also :  both us and eu clearly breached the international law by instigating and participating in the violent destruction of the sovereignty and statehood of ukraine . 
  the * peter iiskola * they quote is the one accusing the minister of defense of being a traitor . 
  the rape guy , * jon helleving * , has since been edited out of the article . 
  as for anything provocative , iiskola calls sending out a letter a ` pre-mobilization ' move , suggesting that finland is gearing up for a war against russia . 
  he also says that it 's cynical ploy to get more funding for the military . 
  that very article created some hubbub in finland , as the two experts quoted were very pro-russian : one of them has called our minister of defense a traitor , the other one called our prime minister a ` nazi whore ' . 
  also , he threatened to rape a finnish opera singer . 
  but otherwise , they offer great impartial insight . 
  and rafale is supposed to be a more affordable modern fighter . 
  so , the wikipedia article specifies that a portuguese man was wielding a ` puukko ' knife . 
  i wonder if it was a marttiini , iisakki j\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 or a good old mora . 
  must suck to own a car in dr congo : [ one the poorest countries in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) , yet petrol prices are equal to northern europe . 
  however , i do n't believe it 's relevant here . 
  i see plenty of russian men sporting said haircut here in helsinki . 
  they do share an affinity for leather jackets , * armani jeans * shirts and questionable jeans , but most of them do n't seem to be balding . 
  [ pictured : the ufo-shaped object found at the bottom of the baltic sea ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2160297/pictured-the-ufo-shaped-object-the-baltic-sea--covered-soot-little-fireplaces-lying-end-1-000ft-runway.html ), 
   they also greatly raised the prices on cigarettes how big is the black market for cigarettes ? 
  russian cigarettes do make it over the border to finland as they are still much cheaper . 
  but so do counterfit cigarettes and they are really cheap . 
  apparently the quality is what it is , but some smokers do n't seem to care . 
  plenty of pretty girls there . 
  i wonder if i could become a millionaire by introducing barber services to russian males . 
  maybe reveal that you can comb your hair in several ways , not just down your forehead . 
  [ finland , no. 1 !, 
  ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vz-qal8mx1a/suap5a54rii/aaaaaaaak8i/aojxnfamkyk/w1221-h814-no/dsc_1576.jpg ), 
  they are pretty fat ? 
  he 's more concerned about his twitter account than politics . 
  he goes around the world saying stupid things somehow forgetting that he 's not speaking for himself , rather he represents the government of finland and to some extent the finnish people . 
  also , he seems pretty imcompetent . 
  but it 's also disingenuous . 
  their whole tactic is : * `` we were n't in the govermnet last time and did n't get us in this mess . 
  '' * it feels less like people support keskusta 's actual ideas ( which have not been clearly stated anyway ) , rather they get votes because they are not kokoomus . 
  the choice is between our worst prime minister in ages and a guy who does n't have an opinion . 
  well , if you insist , here 's some finns who wish they were americans : [ puita uuniin ] ( https://youtu.be/8gshnaeafa8 ) . 
  went to a bar on friday , the bartender was some talkative foreigner . 
  i hoped he would just shut up and give me my beer . 
  i guess this would be pretty finnish ( i.e. 
  not some fellow trying desperately to be american ) : [ elokuu - saatilla ] ( https://youtu.be/jb8nbckva48 ) . 
  [ kullii ] ( https://youtu.be/uwhpqxcep-0?t=2m25s ), 
  well , jolla 's hardware is nothing to write home about and their os , sailfish , is pretty much open source , if i understand correctly . 
  so nokia could just make their own phones with the os . 
  the os is based on nokia 's meego anyway , so it would seem silly to buy it back . 
  okay , it 's an imperfect headline . 
  good ? 
  also , it 's pretty clear nokia will license out its brand to make phones starting next year . 
  they already did it with [ tablets ] ( http://n1.nokia.com/en ) . 
  if they are borrowed from latin , they are obviously loan words . 
  they do n't magically stop being loan words after a certain period of time . 
  but these maps show what sounds correspond to certain letters , not the other way around . 
  just because the same sound is represented in the greek alphabet , does n't mean letters ` g ' or ` r ' are actually part of said alphabet . 
  yeah . 
  but in some ways it 's accurate . 
  a letter like ` g ' of ` r ' is not part of the greek language , so a correct pronunciation does n't exist . 
  similarly , the finnish language does n't have a proper pronunciation for the letter ' \u03b2 ' , beyond just calling it ` beeta ' . 
  and it is n't a full list anyway , it does n't include all consonants , like 's ' or ` b ' . 
  shhh . 
  these maps seem to only show languages with latin alphabet . 
  but are there any dutch words with a ` q ' that are n't loan words ? 
  the map adresses that , giving two pronounciations for swedish [ g/j ] . 
  \u00fe e. wikipedia just told me that letter is called * \u00feorn * . 
  like a 50 kilometer highway for nine billion dollars . 
  well , talking about rally , [ here 's the real classic ] ( https://youtu.be/tagbrm-mmrk ) . 
  enough with the water . 
  send a few rolls of snus and assure us that sweden is * very afraid * to play finland at the hockey worlds and this all goes away . 
  so the belt is discarded ? 
  * in the deserts of germany ... *, 
  good for them . 
  well , our minister of defense is [ this guy ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article7116027.ece/alternates/w960/2+lks+carl+haglund.jpg ) . 
   they are not the only one responsible for the mess the country is in . 
  of course it is responsible . 
  more or less solely . 
  it has been destabilising ukraine for two or three years , supporting the rebels and offering them material assistance . 
  also annexing crimea . 
  stop apologizing for putin . 
  middle east is not in the heart of europe . 
  it 's only natural that eu is more concerned about the stability and integrity of europe than those of middle east or africa . 
  also , the russian talk of de-escalation would be more credible if they withdrew their troops and stopped feeding the crisis . 
   lastly , tsipras is , most likely , not even talking about the sanctions or the invasion . 
  [ alexis tsipras in moscow asks europe to end sanctions against russia ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/08/alexis-tsipras-in-moscow-asks-europe-to-end-sanctions-against-russia ), 
  it 's part of russian invasion to ukraine . 
  there 's an actual invasion of a sovereign european nation going on and the greek prime minister wants to lift the sanctions , normalise the eu relationship with russia . 
  that is basically saying that there 's nothing wrong in attacking other nations . 
  yeah , i know . 
  the russian army accidentally tripped over the border and their buk just went off when they fell down .
