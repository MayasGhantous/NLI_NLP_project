  yeah , the dutch people should forget downing of their countrymen , it was ages ago . 
  and i assume people in ukraine can barely even remember the ongoing russian invasion . 
  yeah , in the sort of battle for your last scraps of humanity under russian rule , not in the fight to keeping your borders untouched . 
  * - we will attack first thing in the morning . 
  * * - but wait , they have pistols !, 
  * * - pistols , you say ? 
  * * - yes . 
  and even some rifles . 
  * * - bloody hell . 
  pack it up and send the troops home . 
  if you are fighting a disorganized guerilla warface against the russian army , your army is in tatters and your nation 's soveirgnity is gone . 
  i guess in that situation more guns is better , but i fail to see how a rich gun culture makes russia a lesser threat . 
  are there countries russia would otherwise attack , but the fear of guerilla warfare is holding them back ? 
  no , i 'm saying that if russia really wants to come and see who 's who , a rich gun culture wo n't help . 
  a shotgun stashed in the attic wo n't stop a tank armada or cruise missiles . 
  would n't mind qualifying for a major football tournament . 
  even once . 
  ( they even expanded the euros , but we can beat bloody northern ireland . ), 
  so you are saying that the [ brown hue of baltic ] ( http://venelehti.fi/wp-content/uploads/vene/uutiskuvat/i/it%c3%a4meri-kuva-pohjant%c3%a4hti-elokuva-oy.jpg ) is not beautiful ? 
  finland has plenty of guns . 
  quite useless if russia nukes helsinki . 
  i do n't think the time of bobrikov was nearly as bad as the [ russian occupation of early 18th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_during_the_great_northern_war ) , or * the great wrath * . 
  then again , the guy in charge at the time , mikhail golitsyn , is n't as big of name in finland as bobrikov . 
  it certainly is possible that russia will have an army of supertanks roaming the taiga . 
  or maybe the systems do n't work quite as advertised and the numbers have to be cut for budgeting reasons . 
  this was posted here just recently : [ russia 's stealth fighter is in serious trouble ] ( https://medium.com/war-is-boring/russia-s-stealth-fighter-is-in-serious-trouble-24ac3ef85227 ) . 
  all these things look awesome on paper . 
  however , i 'm intrigued to see what it really looks like and how it performs . 
  just as long as they stay on the right side of the border . 
  i kept clicking on the wrong yugoslavian states . 
   no , russian drivers licences are n't recognized in belgium ( and the eu ) as far as i know . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  plenty of russians drive in the eu , at least here in finland . 
  [ it has to be this classic , right ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2qjohv/what_did_your_parents_show_you_to_do_that_you/cn6pn30?context=3 ), 
  fixed . 
  but the swedish prime minister has [ this sweet boat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ilpywlx.jpg ) . 
  then again , it 's not like the runner-up had any older [ significant other ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/1188710/landscape16_9/1024/576/78a90eec096c1f4f7eb6abc46643b5e3/tm/1236097.jpg ) . 
  the unsuitably young first lady . 
  my only problem is labeling rome and naples as ` new europe ' . 
  the way i see it , those are property of the finnish state , used to host important political functions . 
  a government needs to have some estates so the president does n't have to rent out a ballroom from a hotel if the president of france happens to visit . 
  the buildings were built over two centuries , so it 's not like the finnish state budget is blown to please the sitting president . 
  by the way , the former president 's residence looked like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/tamminiemenhuvilavillaekudden.jpg ) but now functions as a museum . 
  every finn should have a home , a workplace and a summer cottage . 
  the president has those , although with a little more gilding . 
  thanks !, 
  ( we peaked in the 90 's when we developed a human called jari litmanen . 
  it 's been downhill ever since . ), 
  it 's not all positive though . 
  because of their weird time zone , the [ spaniards sleep 53 minutes less per night than the average european ] ( http://fortune.com/2013/10/04/spains-sluggishness-its-a-time-zone-thing/ ) . 
  you can be active long into night , but you still need to wake up early . 
  and i do n't know if an afternoon nap can make up for it . 
  the map explains why the spaniards are such night people . 
  in the westernmost spain , noon comes at around 14:40 and the evenings are pretty long . 
  my warmest memory of military food was a breakfast on a -20 c february morning , having first skied to where they were serving the meal . 
  we were out camping , but someone brought us breakfast from the base and apparently did n't think things through . 
  so we got a handful of corn flakes and a carton of milk . 
  only the milk was frozen . 
  as i was kneeling there in the dark forest , i put the first spoonful of dry corn flakes into my mouth and the spoon got stuck to my tongue , being so cold . 
  a phony guide , did n't mention superalko . 
  * congratulations estonia , welcome to the club !, 
  with this membeship card , you are allowed to argue about the definition of scandinavia online . 
  * next level : * no , we were not actually vikings . 
  [ the cudgel war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cudgel_war ) . 
  it 's always worth trying . 
  i think we 'll just take a division or two , pack them into cruise ships and sail over . 
  it 's nice to have a decent buffet dinner , restock on snus and listen to a bulgarian cover band play boney m before starting a war . 
  come next morning , we 'll pop out of mariella or symphony , take control of the stockholm city center and declare it the people 's republic of western finland . 
  give us a few years . 
  how will the joint army work when we want to fight each other ? 
  that 's a nice place to skate . 
  are they protecting a statue or what 's the deal with the giant sinking man at the center ? 
  you are right . 
  but the whole ` free tibet ' movement tells us a story of this amazing and peaceful society ( and their own bono , dalai lama ) that is now being opressed by the chinese . 
  in truth , the ordinary tibetan is most likely better off since the chinese took over . 
  and i do n't think tibet even wants to be truly independent , since they benefit from the chinese economy and security . 
  they just want to be like hong kong or taiwan , a special region within china . 
  i believe he was an uruguayan footballer back in the 60 's . 
  yeah , but it 's not like tibet was some sort of utopia before the chinese came . 
  slavery and serfdom was very much the name of the game . 
  dalai lama was a dictator . 
  it 's merely our beautiful central park . 
  having studied swedish for something like 12 years , i 'm surprisingly bad at it . 
  would n't call myself fluent . 
  but i can manage to order a cup of coffee . 
  pop a hot potato in my mouth and i 'm sure i can get my coffee in copenhagen too . 
  apart from that , i do speak a finnish word here and there , plus pretty serviceable rally english . 
  with my fellow finns , i 'd hop on the silja line , arrive at the center of stockholm with a large toblerone bar and few cases of tax-free beer , wondering if the burger king at t-centralen is open . 
  after that , we 'd quietly disperse around sweden . 
  so let 's take the city of [ vyborg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vyborg ) , formerly a major finnish city , since lost to russia . 
  would you consider it asian ? 
  oh , apparently i was quite blind . 
  thanks . 
  very much part of europe . 
  anything west of ural mountains is considered europe and most of russians live there anyway . 
  depends on the type of waste . 
  recycling something like plastics ( a large percetage of waste ) requires a lot of work and energy and it 's usually just cheaper to manufacture new . 
  collecting plastic bottles is n't that hard , but recycling all kinds of food containers , plastic bags and just general junk is difficult . 
  there are so many kinds of plastics that just sorting the waste is laborious .
