  then you have to clean it up maybe drive it around and finally re-use . 
  but things like aluminium or paper is pretty easy to collect and re-use . 
  and that 's why they are collected . 
  i wish the data was per person and not total . 
  however , it is a bit weird that denmark produced 4.2 billion kilograms of waste and finland 2.7 billion , as both have similar populations . 
  i 'm not saying we are better than the danes , i 'm just wondering what is the cause . 
  or maybe russia ... ? 
  back in my day , we had to lie down on the ground , align ourselves with the tracks of a t-72 and roll under the tank just as it was about to crush us . 
  it moved very slowly and was n't very dangerous , but i bet it 's not a pleasant sensation for a claustrophobic . 
  lpt : if a tank is going to run you over , just dive under its belly . 
  tanks for those !, 
  he 's actually icelandic . 
  the asshole hat-trick !, 
  i do n't think this should be news at all . 
  the european champions should defeat [ this team ] ( http://www.worldcupteams.republika.pl/fototeams1994/team_usa.jpg ) . 
  i 'll admit that i once uttered a quiet ` hmmm ' while sitting by the window as my stop was coming up . 
  then again , this only resulted from the earlier code violation of someone sitting down next to me . 
  a mobile phone used to indicate you are wealthy . 
  nowadays the drug addicts have five of them . 
  and a lot of paranoia . 
  the finnish minister of trade was asked about potential risks concerning the ttip . 
  she was really baffled , could n't initially give any answer and and finally started babbling on about how the real risk is being left out of such an agreement . 
  it 's nice that our politicians have thought this one through . 
  well , if he 's american , he probably does n't have the eye to tell us apart . 
  i probably would n't be any better if i 'd had to spot the differences between people living in southeast asia . 
  by the way , a good swede has [ certain roundness to his features ] ( http://www.realtid.se/articlepages/200512/23/20051223082333_realtid544/persson_prbhenrikmontg_w.jpg ) . 
  does n't deter the finns . 
  as long as there 's [ something to drink ] ( http://www.viikonloppu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fiilismies.gif ) . 
  no , but there 's [ jaloviina ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dhcpx2iojhq/uruowcjqdbi/aaaaaaaae3m/h-j8n_bystw/s1600/2012_10_jaloveena03medb2bl.jpg ) . 
  translation : putin wants the former soviet union to adopt the ruble . 
  also , not challenging the euro . 
  yes it is . 
  finland bought a batch of used leopards from the dutch army after they decided to get rid of their mbt 's . 
  finland also has older 2a4 's , bougth from germany , used as well . 
  finland bought some pretty sweet 2a6 's from the dutch army . 
  but if the us president fell ill , i 'm sure it would be communicated pretty clearly , especially if it became a story like this . 
  i do n't see the white house providing the press pictures of old meetings and selling them as recent photos to prove that the president is still kicking . 
  well , there are plenty of cheaper alternatives . 
  some of them you can even fly in bad weather . 
  good thing italy has all that cash lying around . 
  now they can buy this super-expensive and deeply flawed aircraft to protect themselves from ... malta ? 
  switzerland ? 
  and irnbru means * national beverage * in scottish . 
  yeah , i know it includes burning wood . 
  but i 'm wondering how much . 
  the finnish number ( 36,8 % ) sounds quite high . 
  i wonder how much of it is just burning wood . 
  also , uk better hurry if they are going to triple their renewable energy production if five years . 
  it has a nice camo paint for the beaches of j\u016brmala . 
  the first reaction is the usual : * `` yeah , what a surprise , russia . 
  '' * but i guess it 's not really about the penalty , it 's about the enforcement . 
  the size of the fine does n't matter if nobody 's prosecuted . 
  and furthermore , corruption is very much a cultural thing . 
  if it 's generally accepted , it 's not like potential fines are going to stop anybody . 
  [ russia equal !,

  cv90 is goddamned luxury vehicle . 
  after driving a bmp-2 for six months , sitting down in a cv90 cockpit was a borderline religious experience . 
  never drove one though , but i assume it 's pretty nice on the road too . 
  i thought they were supposed to stop selling gas to eu ? 
  i guess they still like money then . 
  my favorite expression in finnish is when you tell someone to get lost : * suksi vittuun !, 
  * - ski into a cunt, 
  i think this has been happening for a while . 
  at least i 've heard that the mcdonald 's of finland never makes any profits , as they have to pay large licencing fees to mcdonald 's . 
  not that i really care , but the [ world bank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs ) claims it 's actually 1.25 % and the [ cia ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2034rank.html ) puts the number at 1.47 % . 
  but do n't worry , we are not joining . 
  and that fool is out of office in just a couple of months . 
  sure , but those were also songs that people might have listened outside the context . 
  well , i would n't call it an exception . 
  but you are right , the beard took the victory to austria . 
  still , it was an thoroughly competent eurovision tune . 
  hungary should have definitely gone with areva of france . 
  their [ current reactor project in finland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3 ) is only six years behind the schedule and 5 billion euros over the original 3 billion budget . 
  such a great value for money . 
  i 'm a bit torn of this subject . 
  on one hand , it 's a very nice story . 
  on the other hand , we are , at least in theory , talking about a music competition . 
  however crappy and campy the eurovision is , i 'd still prefer it to be about the songs . 
  nobody 's voting for these guys because of their music , but because it 's a human interest story . 
  is malta going to counter by sending a legless singer ? 
  [ yay !,

  from what i can find , you lose your licence by going 36 km/h over the limit in town , or 39 km/h on higway . 
  but apparently you can also lose your licence if you are caught speeding three times in one year or four times in two years . 
  i like that the site uses mikko koivu as illustration in the [ suggested article about finland and nato . 
  i think * my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 * , feeling embarrased for someone else , should be easy enought for english-speakers to pronounce . 
  the fallen germans do have couple of nice cemeteries in finland . 
  the one in rovaniemi looks like this : [ 1 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nczzvn4m4ja/ulgxgrqyipi/aaaaaaaaaso/emzfl-ovkwe/s1600/187.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bia0ukcktho/ubnpvma3wni/aaaaaaaar-w/ld4e1xyxedg/s1600/norvaj%c3%a4rvi+german+soldiers+cemetery+rovaniemi.--7.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xptlyihhu4u/ubnsmcax2ei/aaaaaaaar_a/i7xxe7briaa/s800/norvaj%c3%a4rvi+german+soldiers+cemetery,+rovaniemi.-.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/51/ba/e4/german-soldier-s-cemetery.jpg ) . 
  we got something approcaching snow here in helsinki last june . 
  * see !, 
  * finns are of european origin , not mongolians . 
  we 've made it !, 
  that seems to mean nothing . 
  quickly glancing through couple of other countries , it gives a similar assesment to countries such as portugal and slovakia , a bit lower to iceland and japan , a bit higher to italy and sweden . 
  of course there * could * be terrorism , but i think it 's quite self-evident in this day and age . 
  do we invade or just go over there to cause general mayhem ? 
  instructions are unclear . 
  but what about the independence and diversity of mainstream media ? 
  is it all controlled by berlusconi et al ?
