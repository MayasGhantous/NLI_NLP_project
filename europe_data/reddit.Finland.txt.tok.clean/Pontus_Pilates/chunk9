  mcdonald 's has been in finland for 30 years , yet they 've reported profits in only five of them . 
  either the hq is mighty patient with their expansion plans or the profits conveniently disappear when the finnish branch has to pay large licencing fees to luxembourg . 
  in 1918 , finland had an awful three month civil war right after gaining independence . 
  it was fought between socialists ` reds ' and conservative ` whites ' and it was a big mess . 
  it was n't a war of grand battles , rather an ugly affair where most of the almost 40 000 victims died in prison camps and executions . 
  the war ended in white victory but left a deep simmering resentment in the finnish people . 
  it was really only the soviet invasion of 1939 that moved the nation past the civil war , with big external threat unifying people . 
  if he wants danger , shitty apartments and no tourists , the world is full of cities for him . 
  well , not me . 
  i think my time in military has adequately prepared me to die a painful death in any potential war . 
  well , there are some problems involved . 
  such as : conventional power plants are still very much needed for nighttime and as a back-up , but their profitability has gone down dramatically . 
  they are still an integral part of the network , but companies might not want to run them anymore . 
  it 's the diplomatic immunity . 
  they know they can get away with obnoxious behaviour like this . 
   when you compare the costs and where the fighter jets would be bought , the most favorable ones would be either the eurofighter typhoon or the jas-39 gripen . 
  the eurofigher is actually quite expensive . 
  i would think finland will either buy gripens or super hornets . 
  but you never know . 
  if the government continues its endless desire to sit in the same table with the big boys , maybe they 'll order f-35 's . 
  finns are fairly good at taking a [ run-of-the mill meatpie ] ( http://www.turuneines.fi/upl/website/piirakankuori/jttilihapiirakka10.jpg ) and stuffing it full of everything and anything : [ 1 ] ( http://www.palokangrilli.fi/kuvat/mehtalainen.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dlp_fqefdmy/vzqg_dqgwwi/aaaaaaaaafk/x-3wr2svzo0/s1600/file%2b6.7.2015%2b16.46.50.jpeg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/lappeenranta/article8011888.ece/alternates/w960/lihis%20vety%20lihapiirakka%20lappeenranta%20.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.ess.fi/incoming/2015/07/28/lihis.jpg/alternates/w980/lihis.jpg ) . 
  i guess there 's enough to keep track as it is . 
  there is a boatload of commemorative coins throughout eurozone : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_gold_and_silver_commemorative_coins might be difficult for businesses if they had to know hundreds of different coins and whether a weird-looking 20 $ coin was actually legal currency . 
  how have the street partols been lately ? 
  and why odin instead of a finnish god , like ukko or tapio ? 
  what are they supposed to do ? 
  the benefits for families are already fairly generous , it 's just that people do n't want that many kids . 
  he looks like a finnish dude who 's been studying computer science for 8 years and never quite seems to graduate . 
  also plays dungeons & dragons . 
  the way i remember it , the americans did n't take it too well when russia sent arms to its ally , cuba . 
  the link does n't work . 
   it creates unnecessary tension and russia would argue that american military vessels on the baltic create unnecessary tension . 
  i know there has been some reforms , but how does the british blue color relate to their notorious libel laws ? 
  is it some sort of criminal vs. civil law thing ? 
  the puppies are [ fierce hunters ] ( http://www.kennelliitto.fi/sites/default/files/2010_04_01_054.jpg ) . 
  oh , that 's interesting . 
  is there a reason why ? 
  also , i bet the swedes thought that way too , the way the keep talking about finns and their knives . 
  some fine [ finnish puukko 's and leuku 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/krn8vgr.jpg ) in there too . 
  my friend went to lithuania and claimed that compared to finnish girls , lithuanians were +10 cm , -10 kg . 
  either i 've been lied to , or maybe lithuanians [ are like russians ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/agvbwo6_700b.jpg ) . 
  did n't know wales was actually in the caribbeans . 
   plus you have a speed limit that is ... a bit low . 
  on highways , you can really let loose , all the way to 70 km/h . 
  i 'm not sure finland acutally has higher purhasing power than sweden , considering sweden 's higher gdp and lower cost of living . 
  so , the [ forest finns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_finns ) are dying out ? 
  i do n't see it that way necessarily . 
  the stamps bring up prevalent topics , but i do n't think they make value judgements . 
  they are all in form of a punctuation mark and the nuclear power symbol just fits very nicely in a circle . 
  i only had one of those very tiny lego viking lines . 
  for some reason , i ca n't seem to find a picture of one . 
  the article states :  more to the point , the imf officials say that a threat of an imminent financial catastrophe as the guardian puts it , is needed to force other players into accepting its measures such as cutting greek pensions and working conditions , or as bloomberg puts it , `` considering a plan to cause a credit event in greece and destabilize europe . '', 
   according to the leaked conversation , the imf - which has been pushing for a debt haircut for greece ever since last august 's 3rd greek bailout - believes a credit event as only thing that could trigger a greek deal ; the `` event '' is hinted as taking place some time around the june 23 brexit referendum . 
  apparently they are not happy with greece and think that a real disaster could push in the reforms they want to see . 
   i mean his party has been accused of cronyism but this level of corruption is off the fucking scale . 
  do n't tell me it 's the free towels party . 
  please . 
  [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/h%c3%a4n ) gives the following etymology :  from proto-finnic * h\u00e4n , from proto-finno-ugric * se . 
  cognate to hungarian \u0151 . 
  false cognate with swedish han . 
  finland has solved this problem a long time ago . 
  even though we only have a gender-neutral pronoun , ` h\u00e4n ' , we 've gone one step further and refer to people as ` se ' , or * it * . 
  * it * should n't offend anybody . 
  even if you feel like you are a mid-sized washing machine trapped in a man 's body , * it * will not label you in any way . 
   no , why ? 
  because you do n't seem to care if the drugs actually help as long as they cause no harm . 
  homeopathy is perfect for that : magic water that does nothing . 
   taxes are a bit too high as in taxes are lost due to high amount of importing from other countries but on the other hand , how much of the lost taxes are saved in healthcare costs ? 
  last time the taxes were lowered to combat estonian imports , alcohol-related deaths and illnesses went up . 
  as much as we all like to think that our drinking is under control , finland has a lot of problems with alcoholism and most of the legislation tries to curb those . 
  maybe beer could be cheaper if we did n't all pass out at the end of friday evening . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  pain is neurological phenomenon and it can be treated to some extent . 
  if you want to sell painkillers , you need to demostrate that they relieve pain more than placebos . 
  i guess you are advocating homeopathy here , if the only requirement for painkillers is that they do n't do anything . 
  but even painkillers need to go through trials to end up on the market . 
  the effect is subjective , but that 's why they use placebos and control groups . 
  it is n't enough to just say : * `` these pills right here are fairly popular in the philippines . 
  let 's sell them at the pharmacy . 
   some of it is mainstream medicine in china and japan . 
  does n't mean it works . 
  the efficacy of medicine is determined in clinical trials , not in polls . 
  it varies . 
  i think with the recent tensions in europe and finland , the police wants to get ahead of things and just announce that it was a finnish idiot . 
  last time a notable church arson happened in finland it was the [ 15th century church of porvoo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/church.20060530_pm.porvoo_of_finland.ojp.jpg ) . 
  the young man convicted of the crime had expressed ` reservations ' towards christianity . 
  he was also drunk . 
  this is in ylivieska , in the ostrobothnia region . 
  police have apprehended a suspect who has admitted to setting the fire . 
  ( to prevent any speculation , the suspect is descibed as ethnically finnish . ),

  i 'm sure they 'll be happy to do some pretend work for their pretend currency . 
  either the drug is visible for a very long time or there has been some serious miscommunication in russian sports . 
  otherwise this many athletes would n't continue using stuff that is banned . 
  or maybe there 's a chinese restaurant nearby ? 
  asian tourists tend to eat with their compatriots and travel agencies have deals in place with local restaurants . 
  i feel a bit vexed about finland : i see groups of asian tourists roaming the few ` sights ' of helsinki and feel really bad . 
  they are forced to photograph a small statue of a runner right by a garbage bin or a collection of welded-together steel pipes . 
  and while helsinki is a nice city , they 've spent enormous amounts of money to fly to europe and now they are here instead of rome , prague or paris .
