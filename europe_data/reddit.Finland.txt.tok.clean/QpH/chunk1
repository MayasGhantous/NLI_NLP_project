to my understanding it 's made with finnish barley as well . 
  i doubt they 'll move the production , that might alter the taste too much . 
  seconded . 
  define finnish . 
  it 's still made in finland ( until at least 2025 ) , but yes , the owner is a north american company . 
  i bet this is how koreans feel when the western world accuses them of eating dogs . 
  but hellas/grekenland is a country , not a city . 
  what about other countries ? 
  i doubt you use suomi instead of finland etc. 
  [ and here 's mine . 
   plus a whole bunch of other problems . 
  like slavery , which is how those roads were probably built . 
  so , do they have roads made of pure gold in dubai ? 
  too late . 
  [ we need to talk , germany . 
  william itself is an english version of the german wilhelm : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_ ( name ), 
  i wonder why finland 's been split into two ? 
  anyway , the `` southern '' names on the map seem correct , according to [ statistics ] ( http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=279 ) . 
   i 'll just swap from vodafone . 
  yeah , do that . 
  what poor customer service , you should n't need to go through all this hassle . 
  but do * tell them * you 're swapping . 
  that might miraculously solve your problems in no time !, 
  and norrbotten is true north-western finland . 
  ^  some \u00c5landers support [ independence ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c5lands_framtid ) nowadays . 
  i wonder if that could become a reality , might work out well . 
  the folks at / r/unresolvedmysteries have some [ doubts about this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unresolvedmysteries/comments/2fo9we/jack_the_ripper_unmasked_by_new_dna_evidence/ ) . 
  that thing that does n't [ oblige any member state to actually send military aid ] ( http://www.verfassungsblog.de/en/all-for-one-eus-toothless-mutual-defence-clause/ ) ? 
  i 'm sure they would , but they 're not bound by the agreement to do so . 
  i would n't say that really takes the eu closer to being a militaristic union . 
  we do n't have strong military co-operation etc. 
  edit : my point was , in a nutshell , that the eu , a political , financial and economical union does n't really compare to a strictly military alliance like nato . 
   they 're already eu members , they 're not politically neutral . 
  the eu is in no way a militaristic union . 
  comparing the membership duties of the eu to those of nato is just silly . 
  but god dammit . 
  as i re-checked the site after what you said , i noticed the * reporter is finnish * . 
  or at least of finnish heritage . 
  at least that explains the understanding of the nordic/scandinavia thing ... 
  dear bloomberg news site , you * ca n't * replace a finnish \u00d6 with oe , like you can a german \u00d6 . 
  [ it does n't work the same way . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d6#letter_.c3.96_in_other_languages ) you see , the german \u00d6 is actually an o , but with an umlaut . 
  finnish \u00d6 is a separate letter . 
  use niinisto , if you ca n't produce an \u00f6 . 
  thank you . 
  edit : the reporter * is finnish * , yet does n't know this . 
  i do n't even ... 
  just an interesting note to add here : there are exactly seven [ unesco world heritage sites ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/fi/ ) in finland . 
  i doubt that 's an actual , or official , english translation of the place . 
  it goes by suomenlinna in all english-written articles about it . 
  * can confirm * . 
  that 's an electrical box ... ? 
  i thought it was a tent !, 
  you 're sort of right !, 
  * l\u00f6yly * is what we finns call the steam in a sauna . 
  a good sauna experience is often called * hyv\u00e4t l\u00f6ylyt * ( good * l\u00f6yly * s ) . 
  bloodbath , what the man is looking for , is called * veril\u00f6yly * in finnish . 
  blood-l\u00f6yly . 
  yeah , but it 's different . 
  you guys refer to yourselves as being from the us , usa etc. 
  you 'll not hear a citizen of the eu say they 're `` from the eu '' . 
  eu is not seen as a country , like the us is . 
  shared identity , if any , is often shared with whole of europe , not just the union . 
  saying you 're `` visiting eu '' sounds a bit weird , like you 'd be visiting the eu parliament or something . 
  eu is a political , not a geographical term . 
  just go with europe , or rather just use the names of the countries in question . 
   who the hell thinks that ?!, 
  i 'm gon na take a wild guess here and say * ` muricans * . 
  not americans , but ` muricans . 
  or * h\u00e4l\u00e4ri * , * h\u00e4ly * for short . 
   aland ( sweden ) \u00c5land is an autonomous part of finland . 
  it 's sweden that they [ originally wanted to join ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85land#history ) . 
  nowadays it 's that or independence . 
  ... how significant those desires are , however , is something only an \u00c5lander could answer . 
  all i know is that the separatist party , [ \u00c5lands framtid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85lands_framtid ) , has just 3 representatives in the 30-member parliament of \u00c5land . 
   1000 black people to a country with 1000 white people and where is this country , that 's taking in as much immigrants as they already have people ? 
  that would be the stupidest idea ever , and not because of your creepy racial viewpoints . 
  i ca n't help with windows , but on a mac , shift + alt + 0 ( or x ) is \u2260 . 
  \u00b0 is shift + alt + q windows should have similar shortcuts , if it does n't already . 
  on some programming languages , perhaps , but that 's due to limited characters . 
  yes , it 's widely used on the internet , but surely we 've evolved since the 90s , eh ? 
  here , take this : \u2260, 
  oh man , i need to disappoint you . 
  most finns have long since forgotten * hiisi * s , and other heathen ways . 
  they 're much stronger in eesti , with your maausk and everything . 
  ^ edit : ^ grammar . 
  are you being serious ? 
  cause i hope that 's just pathetic trolling . 
  yet no song about the finnish cavalry , the hakkapeliitat , on that album . 
  i was a bit disappointed , as they 've previously made songs like talvisota and white death . 
  i got these : * english dialect : * 1 .

  okay .
