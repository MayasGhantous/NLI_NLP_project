  well , like i said , if they 're indeed guilty , then they should punished , imprisoned . 
  i do n't see any officers making arrests , however . 
  but you sound like a frightened individual . 
  i 'm not afraid , cause i believe in our ways , and in justice . 
  i stand behind our values , i do not trample on them . 
  how could i stand behind these values if i broke them , out of fear , in order to protect them ? 
  it would all be in vain . 
   just as in every other civilized nation in the world , the imprisonment and expulsion of terrorist cells yeah , the americans handled that pretty ... 
  [ poorly . 
  ] ( http://www.hrw.org/features/guantanamo ) i do n't want europe going down that road . 
  are they guilty of terrorism ? 
  if they 're suspected of crimes , they should be investigated , tried and if found guilty , punished . 
  but until then , they have a right to speak their minds , no matter how anyone * feels * about them . 
  and we ca n't just start kicking out people for expressing an opinion . 
  who knows where that 'll lead us ? 
  will we start deporting political opponents next ? 
  people with other kinds of `` wrong ideals '' ? 
  once you go down that road , it 's an neverending spiral . 
  you might find yourself on a plane or in a camp , if you let the europe we know become that . 
  we have to defend * our * way , and our way ( the last i checked ) is not oppression , but democracy , free speech and alike . 
  just because someone * wants * to , does n't mean they 'll be able to . 
  and just because someone * wants * to , does n't mean they should be kicked out . 
  just as you 're not , and should not be , kicked out for disagreeing with me . 
  so is that how a democracy works ? 
  facial recognition via surveillance ? 
  kicking people out for disagreeing with you ? 
  sounds like an oppressive system to me , not a free democracy .

  oh man , times were different back then . 
  no subtitles , no dubbing . 
  just hours and hours of cartoons in english language . 
  you * had * to learn it . 
  he was n't talking about us , but * scandinavian states * . 
  '' ... and no men allowed in the thinking process ! '', 
  seriously . 
  there 's a historical feminist union in finland , * naisasialiitto unioni * , that claims on [ their website ] ( http://www.naisunioni.fi/ ) that they 're ( a free translation ) : `` a politically nonaligned , feminist non-governmental organization , whose goal is the improvement of women 's position [ in society ] and the removal of gender discrimination . '', 
  against gender discrimination !, 
  sounds great !, 
  let 's say i 'm a man , who wants to join in . 
  let 's check out their page for [ membership ] ( http://www.naisunioni.fi/jaseneksi ) : * yhdistys hyv\u00e4ksyy j\u00e4senikseen kaikki naiset , itsem\u00e4\u00e4rittely\u00e4 kunnioittaen . 
  say again ? 
  `` the organization accepts as members * all women , respecting self-definition * . '', 
  so ... no men allowed . 
  unless you 've changed your gender , in which case you 're no longer a man . 
  gender discrimination -- does n't apply to feminists , apparently . 
  that 's why it 's called * world * war ii , after all .

   between brands traditional food should n't be bought , it should be home-made . 
  shame on me , i do n't make it either , but my mom once told me home-made m\u00e4mmi is so much better , her mother always made it .

   displaying the hammer and sickle or a swastika the hammer and sickle are n't really considered offensive , actually . 
  someone [ already posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22dmvc/pictures_of_sweden_and_its_people_inspired_by_the/cgm56j1 ) a bar using it casually on their logo , i think that tells a lot . 
  things might be different in eastern europe , though . 
  and as for the swastika , it 's not always a nazi symbol , the [ finnish air force still uses it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:suomen_ilmavoimien_esikunta.svg ) -- and was using long before the nazis . 
  edit : in fact , [ a lot of people were . 
  ] ( http://reclaimtheswastika.com/history/ ) edit 2 : i think what i 'm trying to say , is that it 's not ignorance nor indifference . 
  it 's just having different views on it , different connotations . 
  we ca n't tell people to stop using symbols because someone else might take offense . 
  in fact , i think the ones who take offense might themselves be showing ignorance . 
   uneducated people do n't know what it means and use it as a symbol for coolness . 
  or just people who * do n't care * , even if they know . 
  and why should they , as the flag does n't have the same connotations here . 
  for them it 's a symbol for rebellion , rock 'n' roll attitude and all that . 
  a lot of rockabillys use it , here and abroad . 
  meow * ing * , rather . 
  the meowing of a cat , kissan miuku . 
   well on a serious note if russia were ever to join the eu , having a flag with the double-headed eagle would go some way to appease nationalists on a serious sidenote , that would anger all non-russian nationalists in the eu . 
  the flag should remain unaltered . 
  it 's not obama 's decision to make .

  i 'd let you in , seriously . 
  and we already have the [ nb8 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nb8 ) !, 
  you 're missing the context , big time . 
  and provided none for your examples . 
  if you see an extremist muslim blow a building up , or flies straight into it , it 's pretty okay to vent your anger and curse out loud `` those fucking muslims '' . 
  it does n't mean you hate every single muslim in the world , but the ones who commited the act . 
  if someone sees a muslim person minding his own business , doing no harm to one and curse `` that fucking muslim '' , now that 's wrong and derogatory . 
   `` fucking israelis , fucking jews '' at the gym while watching a report of farmers being killed by israeli bombs in gaza . 
  that 's not really anti-semitism or racism , that 's just a momentary expression of anger .
