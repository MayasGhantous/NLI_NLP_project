  not that different from `` fucking germans '' during the blitz , eh ? 
  it 's not really the germans the hate is directed to , but the politics that make it happen . 
  ^ perhaps ^ not ^ the ^ best ^ allegory , ^ but ... 
  it 's not about hating the jews , but the far-right israeli politics that unleash the bombs on civilian targets . 
  i bet they do this as a burnt offering to odin , in remembrance of the original , heathen yuletide . 
  ^ fin * n * . 
   the swede or just * swedish * , * a swede * in general . 
  [ yes , we were !, 
  ] ( http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/swedishempire.png ), 
   estonia and finland used to be very connected before ww2/ussr , personally i just see it as a natural re-emerging process of those old ties rather than something new . 
  seconded . 
  unfortunately a lot of people have forgotten this . 
  the russian one is n't exactly small either . 
   can you imagine living in a world where all newspapers printed the same things from the same angle ? 
  a world where not just the critical reader , but * everyone * are left to do their own thinking , judging and opinion-forming ? 
  a world where people * learn * to do that , because no one tells them how to think ? 
  yes , please . 
  i 'd like that . 
  i 'd like to see a map of how * biased * the media is in different countries . 
  neutral , non-sensationalist information for me , thanks . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/venalaisia_voi_olla_suomessa_yhta_paljon_kuin_ruotsinkielisia_vuonna_2050/6638771 ) , russian might be as common as swedish in 40 years . 
  i actually have no idea if they were both male by coincidence . 
  i think some storm was named female a couple years ago . 
  i find it mildly infuriating that russia is on the left , and eu on the right . 
  it should be the other way around , because west -- east . 
   what was the storm called in your countries ? 
  the one before that , a few weeks back , was called eino . 
  both male names , finland names storms according to name days . 
  but accurate . 
  misleading titles on reddit are infuriating . 
  instead they should be as accurately descriptive as possible . 
   basically it states that all swedes are pussies and that finns are superior , period . 
  i did n't understand anything , but i watched it to the end . 
  and was smiling all the way through !, 
  what i see is a very inaccurate title . 
  i was expecting portraits of the average life in said countries . 
   yup , the looks of their male population . 
  here it 's more about the stereotypical swedish accent . 
  it sounds girly to finnish ears . 
  our manliness ? 
  i thought we were all [ drunken , puukko-wielding melancholics . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nal9oygyxog ), 
  finns mostly joke about how gay you swedish ( men ) are . 
  no offence to gay people !, 
  ^ i ^ would n't ^ want ^ to ^ be ^ compared ^ to ^ a ^ swede ^ either . 
  it 's not that simple , though sometimes it can be in singular form . 
  there 's a subtle difference between the two , when i think about it :  * kuusi kuuta palaa * , would suggest that only six moons out of x number of moons return . 
   * kuusi kuuta palaavat * , as in all six moons return . 
  here 's something about this , [ in finnish though . 
  pelaavat means * are playing *  it 's alright to use it in spoken language , as long as the context is clear . 
  but book language is more strict , so i would n't use * palaa * instead of * palaavat * , as * palaa * ( also ) means * to burn * . 
   kuusi kuuta palaa = six moons are burning  kuusi kuuta palaavat = six moons are returning ** but ** . 
  when talking about * playing * , it works either way , as * pelaa * means nothing else . 
  yet again , i 'd rather use the latter in writing , as the first one is clearly a spoken form :  kuusi kuuta pelaa = six moons are playing  kuusi kuuta pelaavat = six moons are playing ^ oh ^ man , ^ i 'm ^ almost ^ confusing ^ myself ^ here .

   shit just hit the fan * paska osui juuri tuulettimeen . 
  * yep , it sure did !, 
  nah , we were just discussing whether or not there were grammatical errors . 
  easier to do that in one 's own language . 
  there are just different ways of saying that , but there are a couple of grammatical errors there . 
  you ca n't say `` palaa '' ( return ) when talking about a plural form , you should say `` palaavat '' . 
  then again , dialects do come into play as well . 
  i understand how you feel , but this is about * terminally ill children * . 
  ones who just do n't have a chance . 
  [ and cds is sometimes used as a slow form of euthanasia .

  it 's just a matter of letting go now or later . 
   one day the whole world can enjoy something like this . 
  the world ? 
  let 's take it [ even further ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tiwytcwp2i ) . 
  i 'm not sure about the karelian flag there . 
  they [ have this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelians ) as well . 
  we had something similar , but a lot earlier . 
  in 1918 -- 19 , after our independence from russia , there were some attempts to establish the kingdom of finland . 
  there was an even earlier one in 1742 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_ ( 1918 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_ ( 1742 ), 
  `` finnish language '' is indeed translated into * suomen kieli * , but just `` finnish '' is , just , * suomi * . 
  http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=209 ( in finnish ), 
  random fact time : in finnish , the word for irish ( as in someone or something from ireland ) is * irlantilainen * . 
  derivative from * irlanti * , ireland . 
  but the word for the irish language is * iiri * . 
  ( the letter ` i ' in finnish is pronounced like ` e ' in the english word `` me '' ) . 
  edit : just popped into mind , cause usually languages are named after the country . 
  even finnish is * suomi * , from * suomi * , finland . 
  languages are always lower-case to differentiate them from the country names . 
  or rather just because we have different rules for lower - and upper-cases , but still . 
   european dream no , no , no . 
  do n't bring these semireligious american patriotism thingies to europa . 
   the article failed to mention what language or accent this girl spoke with . 
  while some people have already mentioned that a 4-year old would have forgotten her own language or accent , and i 'm not denying this , i want to share something here : we begin learing our language * and * accent while in the [ womb of our mother ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/11/091105-babies-cry-accents.html ) . 
  babies cry with `` an accent '' , these studies show . 
  it 's not like the geographical region now known as switzerland [ has * never * been under a monarch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_history_of_switzerland ) . 
  the map is weird , as it only takes into account modern borders . 
  now , like i said , the * area now known as switzerland * , has n't always been what it is . 
  neither have various other regions . 
  for example , finland was part of sweden for hundreds of years , and under a monarch . 
  then a hundred years under the emperor of russia . 
  but the rebublic of finland , of whose modern borders are in the map , has ... * never been under a monarch * . 
  so where do we draw the line ? 
  700 years ? 
  you do n't drink the beer * in * the sauna , but afterwards .
