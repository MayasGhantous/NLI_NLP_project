  at least , you should . 
  the beer gets warm very fast , so it is n't even a nice experience . 
  much more refreshing to sip a cool beer while your skin is steaming in the cold , northern winter evening , on the porch of the sauna . 
  the heat is n't anything like , say , a hot day is . 
  it 's very , very moist and steamy in there . 
  i feel ill if it 's over 30c \u00b0 outside , but sauna is a different business . 
  i feel cold if it is n't hot enough . 
  really hard to explain , but that 's just how it goes . 
   in finland , both men and women bathe in the sauna , but never together except within the family . 
  what ? 
  i 've always bathed with my friends , regardless of their gender . 
  friends , their friends , their friends friends ... 
  strangers , practically . 
  edit : and yes , * nude * , before someone asks . 
  it 's not an erotic place , at least for me . 
  it ca n't be , i do n't find a hot , 80c \u00b0 steamy room a place to get horny . 
  still , we were not a union . 
  [ here , read this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden%e2%80%93finland ), 
   union * all power * was in stockholm , we had no king of our own . 
  i would hardly call that an union . 
  this is perhaps partly why were seen as part of the * rike * . 
  so even historians are wrong , calling it '' * ruotsin vallan aika * '' , '' * era of swedish rule * '' ? 
  yes , were seen part of the * rike * , but that does n't mean we were seen as equals all the way . 
   finnish language was supressed and so on though . 
  swedish was obviously the language of politics etc. , but finnish was n't really supressed . 
  it was n't until 1800s and the ideas of nationalism that any empire or ruler began systematically supressing other languages . 
  but alas , we were already part of russia then . 
  and they began suppressing finnish language , which only strengthened our desire for independence . 
  hard to say what sweden would have done , were we had still been part of them . 
   we 've been a country togheter with finland this is n't the first time i 've heard this . 
  do swedes really see it that way ? 
  most finns tend to see us being * under your rule for 700 years * . 
  not really as part of you , or a country together . 
  you do realize finland is n't part of scandinavia ? 
  so a united scandinavia would be missing it 's balls . 
  oh , i 'm * so * surprised . 
  when we look at history , it 's hard to find a time when anyone claiming to be defending christian europe is * not * wielding a sword . 
  sometimes they were * literally * wielding one . 
  surely you mean huvila arctic circle ale , which by no means is a * stout * . 
  and it does n't really have the feel of sahti , imo . 
  sure , it has junipery notes to it , rather strong ones too if i recall correctly . 
  but sahti-like ? 
  nope . 
  just a strong ale with a juniper twig ... 
  i mean twist . 
   michael jackson speaking of the late beerhunter , he had only good things to say about [ finnish sahti ] ( http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000861.html ) . 
  [ siperia imperial stout ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/plevnan-siperia-imperial-stout/53188/ ) is pretty damn good . 
  and rated # 1 of finnish beers at ratebeer.com . 
  you can customize the ratebeer 's top-50 lists by country ( or by style ) [ here ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/top-50/ ) . 
  however , being finnish i have to say a good , fresh * [ sahti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahti ) * is the best we have . 
  it 's unique to the region , and one of the oldest ( if not * the * oldest ) beer styles still made . 
  and someone still [ makes it the traditional way ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/hollolan-hirvi-kivisahti/34201/ ) , by adding hot rocks to the mash . 
  this is something one * has * to try if they have the chance . 
  the most popular ones ? 
  shitty , tasteless , watered-down lagers that all have alc . 
  content of around 4,7 % . 
  do n't bother with them . 
   europe is a country we also speak french !, 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cey35bbwxls ) watch that , you wo n't be disappointed . 
  [ here 's an article about the name ] ( http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1972/is-turkey-the-bird-named-after-turkey-the-country-or-vice-versa ) ( and it 's relation to the bird * turkey * ... ) , but it also says that :  the country was already called `` turki '' or `` turkeye '' in english by 1275, 
  i believe the word is of scandinavian origin . 
  the swedes call grain liquor [ br\u00e4nnvin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a4nnvin ) , literally * burn-wine * . 
  we finns call it * viina * , short for * paloviina * . 
  ( not that different from the finnish word for wine : * viini * . ), 
  the latter being a rather straight-forward translation of br\u00e4nnvin . 
  i can only assume that the estonian * viin * has the same etymological base . 
  [ livonians have their own version too !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1smdxmwvbh4 ) ps . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqshi-a0ycm ) is absolutely beautiful . 
  well then . 
  literally it means something like `` oh , huh ? '', 
  but the meaning does n't quite come through with that . 
  or perhaps it does , actually . 
  edit : while am at it , i got ta bring out something i find * hilarious * . 
  `` it 's a little wrinkled '' , [ she says ] ( http://fi9.eu.apcdn.com/full/56849.jpg ) in the picture . 
  but the estonian `` pisut kortsus '' has a different meaning in finnish : ( there is ) * pee in a condom * . 
  [ i kid ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pisu#finnish ) you [ not ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kortsu ) . 
  i 'm sure there are finnish words and/or expressions that do n't translate correctly to estonian , and i 'd love to hear them !, 
   happy and bubbly and stuff ai t\u00e4h ? 
  ^ ( just to clarify to other people : there 's a play with words here . 
  `` ait\u00e4h '' means * thanks * in estonian , but `` ai t\u00e4h ? '', 
  is finnish , equivalent to `` say what ? '' ), 
  try the basic form , * sulosointuinen * . 
  you might like [ estonian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--i3pwggabe ) as well . 
  thanks !, 
   at the end of the day these `` stereotypes '' are nonsense very true . 
  i bet all nations have more in common than differences . 
   it 's not meant as an insult . 
  oh , i know you silly swede . 
  [ ca n't even make insults , can you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg ) ? 
   finns are basically seen as swedes try saying that in finland . 
   finland is basically still sweden come here and say that again , perkele . 
  yeah . 
  and even if a genetic link was there , so bleeping what ? 
  there 's some weird racist attitude to this joke . 
  i would n't care , as i do n't see other ethnicities being lower than others . 
  `` temporarily out of stock '' oh , wow . 
  awesome .
