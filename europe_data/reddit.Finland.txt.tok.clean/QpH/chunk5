   some parts of finland accept swedish as second official language swedish is finland 's second official ( or as we call them , * national * ) language . 
  swedish is still mandatory in schools . 
   estonia and latvia have had pretty much the same historic path hi , a finn here . 
  it 's kinda like finland has a historic path with sweden . 
  time separated us , the finns and estonians , but in some weird way we have a similar path in the sense that neither one of us ethnically belong to where we 're tied to . 
  if that makes any sense . 
  and hey , i 'm all for [ nordic-baltic co-operation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nb8 ) !, 
  hey , count us finns in on that !, 
  stockholm seems to really [ hate us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtw-drv-ps ) . 
   best nordic drinking buddy :d yeeees , bring on the mikkeller beers . 
  there 's an ongoing internet meme that finns are actually of mongol blood . 
  it 's true that the finnish roots are from the east , the ural mountains . 
  but that 's a looong time ago , and not really mongolia . 
  but hey , it 's the internet . 
  i think it 's also partly due to claims that ( eastern ) finns have similar facial features to asians . 
  specifically in the eyes . 
  [ here 's a slightly racist , but a humorous approach to it by someone . 
  ] ( http://static.naamapalmu.com/files/0f/big/gznhyx0snnqw03q8yfwi.jpg ) on the right you can see [ laura lepist\u00f6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laura_lepist%c3%b6 ) , a former figure skater . 
   i understand that , but was it also so for finlandssvenskarna ? 
  let 's not forget the sverigefinnar !, 
  but yeah , obviously not . 
  but then again , like i said , these are post-nationalistic thoughts . 
  modern ideas of nationality did n't exist back then , there was n't a sense of national belonging before the 1800s . 
  not all ancestors of modern finns got along that well hundreds of years ago , and i bet the same goes for the forefathers of the swedish as well . 
  things were very , very different back then and should n't be looked at with modern views . 
  and i do believe the g\u00f6ta - , norr - and swealanders still have their differences ? 
   same goes for our `` tribes '' , like the tavastians , savonians , karelians etc etc. 
   finland was seen as a part of sweden , not something we invaded ( perhaps a tad arrgant , but the truth ) yes , quite true , but erhm . 
  there might be a tad different view about that here in the \u00d6sterland . 
  while not invaded , we were under foreign rule . 
  and the swedish did bring christianity here , which replaced our ancient beliefs . 
  lalli is still a great legend amongst us . 
  the peasant who slaughtered a ( english ? ), 
  bishop who came here with the swedish crusaders to spread christianity . 
  in fact , if i 'm not mistaken , the written history of finland begins with this event . 
  the legend of lalli might certainly be fiction , and the swedish crusades are disputed amongst some historians . 
  but what 's for a fact is that christianity in finland gained foot around the same time sweden took control , no matter how it happened . 
  and christianity does n't have a reputation of being kind to pagans . 
  so one might say some finns see the whole ordeal as an invasion towards our culture , our way of life . 
  these obviously are modern , post-nationalism era thoughts , as no one knows for sure what our ancestors thought about these things .

   on dvd language menus , suomi , as mysterious and enticing as it is , is in fact finnish . 
  also , soumi , as mysterious and misspelled as it is , is in fact also finnish . 
  why do they seem to get it wrong so often ? 
  does soumi somehow make more sense as a word than suomi ? 
  epic heroes , imho , are ( often ordinary ) people who go above and beyond the call of duty , who perform extraordinary feats . 
  like one sniper in the winter war , [ simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ) , nicknamed * the white death * by the red army . 
  to this very day , he has the highest kill count in any major war , 505 . 
  and that 's just with the sniper rifle , the full count is at least 705 . 
  all in 100 days . 
  oh , did i mention he used iron sights rather than telescopic ? 
  and that he got shot in the head . 
  with an explosive bullet . 
  * survived * . 
  when asked in 1998 how he had become such a good shooter , he answered `` practice . '', 
  it should be holding * both * the eu and israeli , and imho , even the palestinian flags . 
  now it looks really stupid , as if the subreddit is promoting israel . 
  well , the chairman of the education and culture committee , raija vahasalo , commented on the matter . 
  she said that the petition is unlikely to cause any changes . 
  she also was ever so pleasant to tell the news she * did n't even read it * . 
  what 's good , however , is that even she does n't believe the parliament is just going to reject it . 
  `` oh , we 'll show those barbarian natives what * real * civilization is like !, 
  they 'll be so much happier . '', 
  usually nations wage war and conquer areas to exploit and colonise them , not to improve them . 
  here 's what she said , and my translation of it . 
  any corrections are welcome . 
  `` all of us have encountered situations , in which we have to ponder , if we dare to act against the public opinion or norm , peer pressure or even the law , if these are against the word of god . '', 
  i need to add something here . 
  * perkele * has a much more interesting etymology than simply being another word for the devil . 
  from [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/perkele ) : `` derives from the name of the baltic deity of thunder , compare lithuanian perk\u016bnas and slavic perun . 
  the meaning was changed to devil by priests after the introduction of christianity . '', 
  also , in my opinion , it 's a much * stronger * word than saatana . 
  it has more potent due to how people often excessively roll the ** r ** - sound , `` pe ** rr ** kele ! '' . 
  quite vulgar really , but used * a lot * . 
  it 's a cultural thing . 
  you do realize that when people say `` you '' or `` you people '' they mean the country of united states and/or their foreign policy ? 
  they 're not blaming * you * as an individual . 
  i do n't want to generalize , but this seems to be the attitude of many americans . 
  many of you seem to take it * very , very personally * when someone criticizes your government and/or country , uncabable of understanding that you as an individual , as a person is not what 's being criticized . 
  please , stop that . 
  there 's no reason the get personal over political issues . 
  ** edit : ** [ here 's a nice article about * generic you * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generic_you ) . 
   change the anthem to jean sibelius ' `` finlandia '' , but i do n't know if that 's still a plan , maybe a finn could chip in about the current situation ... 
  the only place i hear any talk about that anymore , are the rare instances when someone brings it up on the internet . 
  any official talk seems to be over . 
  personally , i think it 's awesome we share the anthem . 
  * bros and sis ' * . 
  very true !, 
  but i would date the beginning farther back , all the way to mid-1700s . 
  how new is the american identity anyway ? 
  i mean , and correct me if i 'm wrong , during your war for independence most people still identified themselves as british , did they not ? 
  when did the american identity come into being , and was there perhaps a stage where people identified themselves with their homestate ? 
  this is pretty interesting , cause it 's so different from how our national identity was born . 
  we spoke our own and different language than our neighbours . 
  i think through-out europe language has been the first and foremost reason for a national identity . 
  that 's not really the case with the anglosphere at all . 
  the one * with * the holes . 
  yummy , butter-filled holes , mmm ... 
  * meanwhile in [ lapland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapland_%28region%29 ) * would be more accurate with that map . 
  oh , and i was expecting it to mean something entirely different .
