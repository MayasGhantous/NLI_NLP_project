  nice to see someone liking our words !, 
  well . 
  nauru , the island , means * laughter * in finnish . 
  it 's not impossible at all for thing like this to happen . 
  just out of curiosity i must ask , what does your username mean ? 
  in finnish , * haaveilla * means * to dream * , * r\u00eavasser * ( online dictionary , hope i got that right ... ), 
  ah , so that explains why the wolf population seems to follow the northern border of finland and russia so closely . 
  i was wondering about it , thanks . 
  well , that is true . 
  have an upvote . 
  do note that brain4breakfast was comparing the states to north korea , and using that reference in a very unnecessary fashion . 
  there 's a huge difference in abandoning a gesture that would later become associated with evil , and * blaming a country for using the nazi salute * . 
  hear , hear , neighbour . 
  personally i 'm not a fan of nato , as it 's too big and basically a tool for u.s. politics . 
  i would rather see a nordic defence union , [ nordefco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordefco ) taken to another level . 
  thoughts ? 
   and americans used to salute their flags in the same way that we 'd recognise as a nazi salute today . 
  you have valid points , mate , but that 's just pointless . 
  the salute was long known as the roman salute . 
  you just played the [ nazi card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_hitlerum ) . 
  shame on you . 
  let 's take it even further . 
  we 're all `` related '' to the sun , moon and the stars in the sky -- and everything else in the universe . 
  ... i love doctor who . 
  i find it funny for a person from a nordic country asking why people * in need * get something for free . 
  [ upper left corner of the pic we 're talking about ... ] ( http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/eu27_populationcartogram.jpg ), 
  `` united we stand '' ? 
  what the serious ... 
  please , do n't place mottos of * the united states of america * to things like these . 
  the motto of the eu is * in varietate concordia * . 
  edit : so , i 've been corrected . 
  * united we stand * is not a motto of the united states of america . 
  but it 's not of the eu either . 
  thanks to everyone who called out this mistake . 
  not when it 's actually relevant . 
  finnish and estonian have roots there , they 're * originated * from the urals , they 've evolved from them . 
  by your logic , we could dismiss every european language , because they * all have roots outside europe * , if we look back enough . 
  `` as the product was not in line with the information on the package , we ca n't do anything else besides throw them away . 
  you ca n't give them away , '' henrik nyberg , nordic production director at findus , told svd . 
  yes you can . 
  to the homeless , to the poor , the ones in need . 
  you god damn * can * , if you just decide to . 
  wasting perfectly edible food is a disgrace . 
  probably because of * scandinavianism * . 
  while we 're a nordic country as well , we 're not quite the same -- ethnically that is . 
  they 're scandinavian , we 're fennic . 
  we should be looking towards estonia in this sense . 
  if you ask me , estonia is a forgotten nordic country . 
  they share history with the scandic region as well . 
  then again , if history would 've gone differently , we might have seen the rise of independent karelia , and ingria . 
  with them , the baltic-finns could have formed their own union . 
  and i 'm not talking about finnicization or suur-suomi , but of an equal brotherhood . 
  but these , these are just the echoes of [ lost times and wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heimosodat ) . 
  well , that 's what we 're good at , a shield against the east . 
  blame the geography . 
  take us ? 
  wait , what ? 
  we 're on the * [ same side ] ( http://www.nordefco.org/facts-about-nordefco/ ) * !, 
  are you being serious or just joking ? 
  probably , but as you said : * if * . 
  i must add that i 'm not taking any sides in this matter , just saying how things are now . 
  what you said was that \u00c5land would like to join sweden . 
  i said that is n't the case anymore . 
  behind the link : from `` a swedish province in finnish possession '' to `` an autonomous part of finland '' . 
  that used to be the case , indeed . 
  then [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85land_crisis#autonomy_of_.c3.85land_islands ) happened . 
   most sami/part sami people ( i 'm 1/4 ) does n't really identify or relate to sami culture at all quite sad , when you look at * why * it is so . 
  the sami were forcefully assimilated into the main culture in all nordic countries , forced to speak a language not their own etc. 
  a shameful part of nordic history , i must say . 
  i do n't know if karelia would use that flag . 
  most baltic finnic tribes tend to use a nordic cross on their flags , and even karelia once had [ one ] ( http://heninen.net/flags/english.htm ) . 
   most sami gathered in a city i believe the situation is similar here in finland as well -- most of them tend to live outside the traditional sami area . 
  also , the amount of sami in sweden seems to be [ second highest ] ( http://www.norway.org.uk/aboutnorway/society/people/population/sami/ ) . 
  there 's info in english behind the link for anyone who does n't speak swedish . 
  then there 's * sakemanni * for germans . 
  probably just derived from * saksalainen * , * ( a ) german * . 
  any love for us sisters as well ? 
  [ someone already did . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lof5y/the_netherlands_vs_france/cv8ekjc ) and you remembered incorrectly . 
  the alternating thing was a joke by david mitchell . 
   yet for some reason we call a breastfeeder rintaruokkija here . 
  it 's literally breast-feeder . 
  i think it 's loaned from english ? 
  what should we call them then ? 
  sounds really silly . 
  and illogical , unlike * rintaruokkija * . 
  finding people a roof to live under is easier than coming up with jobs , is it not ? 
  you know , it would be nice for being homeless to actually be illegal . 
  not in the way you think , though . 
  but in the way that the state should * have * to find housing for people living in the streets , and help them get things back together . 
  you know , proper social security . 
  that was n't the end of the war . 
  it continued in northern sweden until the following year ( do remember that finland was part of sweden , so effectively still at war as well ) . 
  the final peace agreement happened on september 17th , 1809 . 
  seems like you do n't remember things either ... it was * 1809 * . 
  ^ ( i do n't think that he missed the context . ), 
  due to a geographical misunderstanding as a child , i still sometimes think of germany when i see a map of europe and glance at where france is . 
  alt + shift +1 seems to do it on fruit computers . 
  do n't know about windowed ones . 
   even if you specifically know the name of the liquor , you 'll get zero hits on their stately owned outlet ( alko.fi ) not true anymore .
