  that used to be so , but it changed due to some new laws . 
  i think a year back ? 
  not sure . 
  a positive change in that regard , but our alcohol laws are still stupid as a whole . 
  yes , they will be . 
  * all three * baltic states are observer members in the nordic council , have been since 1991 . 
  it 's only a matter of * time * . 
   hey , back in the day maybe once per week was even extremely frequent , who knows ? 
  [ you 're pretty much spot on ] ( http://www.danishnet.com/vikings/cleanliness-did-vikings-take-baths/ ) :  we also know from the accounts of the anglo-saxons that the vikings who settled in england were considered to be ` clean-freaks ' , because they would bath once a week . 
  this was at a time when an anglo-saxon would only bath once or twice a year . 
  in fact the original meaning of scandinavian words for saturday ( laurdag / l\u00f8rdag / l\u00f6rdag ) was ` washing day ' . 
  did you not read the article ? 
  the units * are not in ukraine * . 
  the soldiers fled their units , training in southern russia , so they would n't have to go to ukraine , as they 're pressured to do . 
  dammit , it 's in the title as well : `` fearing ukraine deployment '' , as in deployment * to * ukraine . 
   synchronized you mean * dubbed * . 
  what if the implication was intentional ? 
  unity in europe -- * under one queen * . 
   but they soon adapted to the standard finnish system . 
  i think their 2l bottles are still not accepted in other places , but generally everything is really smooth . 
  are we living in the same finland ? 
  cause * none * of the proprietary lidl bottles are accepted elsewhere . 
  that 's nothing . 
  here are the [ ** 2253 ** word-forms of the finnish noun `` kauppa '' ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) . 
  all other nouns have a similar number of forms . 
  you ~ ~ can ~ ~ should still recycle the cans -- the reverse vending machines ^ * accept them , but obviously do n't give you any deposit back . 
  ^ ( * what google translate suggested . ), 
   the occasional u with an umlaut . 
  jokes aside , we do n't have umlauts in finnish ( \u00c4 and \u00d6 are separate letters of their own , thus the dots are not umlauts ) , and we do n't use \u00dc 's . 
  3 : ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ idea ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ talking ^ ^ ^ about . 
  that and * [ perkele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perkele#origins ) * as well . 
  i feel like there 's a part of history somewhere that has been forgotten . 
  ^ edit : oh , and * suomija * could be considered a finnish word . 
  the verb * suomia * means * to lash into * , * gibe * , * reproach * [ on/at someone ] . 
  * suomija * would be someone who does just that , a * lasher * , a * giber * . 
  and no , the finnish word suomi does not mean lashing or gibing in itself , only the verb * suomia * does . 
  weird , i know . 
  besides , it 's a very old-fashioned word , not really used much . 
   suomija oh wow , you actually derive that from our native name , unlike most of the world . 
  and more loosely , the flag of europe as a whole . 
  i believe this was the original intention , but eu sort of adopted it . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
   `` kyrp\u00e4 '' ( no other meaning than penis ) not anymore , but it [ used to mean a lone , tall tree ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulli ) . 
  perkele is indeed probably a loan word . 
  from the baltic god of thunder , * perk\u016bnas * . 
  that 's what perkele was as well , a deity of the sky/thunder ( as far as i know ) . 
  then the christians came and made it a name for the devil himself . 
  it 's ruotsi , and they do n't sound ^ too ^ much alike , do n't worry . 
  ^  the etymology , as i just googled , is from the germanic * frouwa * . 
  the swedish word * fru * is actually related to it , as are the estonian * proua * and the northern saami * rovva * . 
   it 's the same as saying `` sir '' . 
  no it is n't . 
  `` herra '' ( sir ) and `` rouva '' ( ma'am ) are . 
   you guys will need another simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ... we have 5,439 million of them . 
   finland will be completely occupied in under a week . 
  that 's what they said the last time . 
  you 're really missing the point of what * de facto * means . 
  it 's pretty much right there with official , no one 's just bothered to make it official . 
  besides , norway 's anthem is n't official either . 
  it 's just as much of a custom , a * de facto * anthem . 
  why have norway on the map ? 
   yours is not , why not get over it ? 
  since it 's not an * official * anthem to begin with , who defines they 're not part of it ? 
  there is no law about it , just a custom . 
  it 's the * de facto * anthem of finland and based on a poem of eleven verses -- of which only two are sung . 
  the eleven verses of maamme are part of it , it just got shortened . 
  you 're nitpicking about how these things are phrased on wikipedia . 
  i do n't see the difference between that and any of the other non-sung lyrics . 
  any non-sung lyrics are not really part of the anthem , are they ? 
  so why are there other non-sung lyrics included in the map ? 
  the version used as the anthem of the european union ** does not have lyrics/vocals ** . 
  quite understandable . 
   the more complex process involves annulment of your sacraments ( communion , baptism , etc ) and that needs to be done by the official church process by their rules . 
  now i wonder , why would an atheist care of such obviously religious traditions ? 
  sounds bothersome indeed . 
  we have a [ website ] ( https://eroakirkosta.fi/dynamic/index.php/ ) in finland that you can use to leave the church . 
  all you have to do is fill out a few forms and they 'll do the rest for you . 
   i for one am technically catholic because the process of becoming an atheist is just so bothersome . 
  technically , the process of becoming an atheist is this simple : -- do n't believe in god ( s ) . 
  you probably meant leaving the church . 
  how bothersome can that be ? 
  here you just have to inform them . 
  our word for queen is also derived from kuningas : * kuningatar * . 
  it 's basically just kuningas , but with the tar-suffix , indicating a female form of the word . 
  ( the s gets dropped because grammar . ), 
  so , technically , we 've been calling queens * kings * for ages , where as the ~ ~ germanic languages have ~ ~ english language has been calling them just * [ women ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/queen#etymology ) * :  queen  etymology  from middle english queen , quene , cwen , from old english cw\u0113n , cw\u01e3n ( `` woman ; wife , consort ; queen , empress , royal princess '' ) , from proto-germanic * kw\u0113niz ( `` woman '' ) , from proto-indo-european * g\u02b7\u1e17n ( `` woman '' ) . 
  talk about equality . 
  and yes , thank you , i have been noted several germanic languages do this as well . 
  english does n't , let 's all point fingers at them . 
   that stole karelia part of karelia . 
  we , in return , tried to steal it back -- along with parts of karelia that were n't ours to begin with . 
  iceland was also the [ first western european country to recognize palestine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iceland%e2%80%93palestine_relations ) . 
  it looks like some kind of an estonian devil has enslaved the latvians and lithuanians , eradicated finland and sweden , engulfed the rest of europe in flames , and established nearly 300 outposts in norway . 
  * [ eesti stronk ] ( http://static3.fjcdn.com/comments/but+eesti+can+eesti+_8778dd6b56b5117f43b5c1a0bb72427b.png ) * !, 
  that 's simple logic . 
  you could as well say the finno-ugric people stem from a place * filled * with forests -- so much forest that you would n't need a word for it . 
  in short : that 's not how it works , silly . 
  oh , so there are . 
  did n't realize . 
  and * shopping centre * means both kinds , mind you .
