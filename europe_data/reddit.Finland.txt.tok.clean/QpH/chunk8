  your pictures are of * strip malls * , where as itis is more specifically a * shopping mall * . 
  but hey , we have the largest fully enclosed shopping centre in the nordic region , [ itis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/itis_shopping_centre ) . 
  that 's not bad at all , aesthetically or otherwise . 
  [ nope ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ven%c3%a4j%c3%a4#etymology ) , it 's a coincidence . 
  but still one country away from germany !, 
   and horrible difficult if it would come as a puzzle of 1000 pieces . 
  not sure how many pieces this has , but [ here you go ] ( http://two.flash-gear.com/npuz/puz.php?c=v&amp;id=3285327&amp;k=1265026 ) . 
   but did anyone stop to ask women how they actually feel ? 
  the women who were attacked , or women who were n't even there ? 
   `` we decided to have a fun day in cologne , even though we heard about what happened , '' a young student from the german city of munster told dw ah . 
  women who * were n't even there * . 
  but she has a point :  `` we heard about the attacks , but what can you do ? 
  you can not stop your life after every incident , otherwise you simply wo n't have a life at all , '' the swedish tourist added . 
  `` you have to live your life normally . '', 
  exactly . 
  and people should be * able to live their life normally * , not having to fear hundreds of men groping them . 
  at the same time . 
  at the same square . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  someone who knows a thing or two about heraldry here , hello . 
  first of all , finland is n't in that . 
  that 's the arms of the [ house of bjelbo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_bjelbo ) , part of the greater coat of arms of sweden [ to this day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_sweden#greater_version ) . 
  other than that , the countries are right . 
  the thing surrounding the arms is an * [ ecclesiastical hat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecclesiastical_heraldry#ecclesiastical_hat ) * , used in clerics ' coat of arms ' . 
  i was n't able to find those particular arms online , but i did come across [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_vasa#kings_of_poland_and_grand_dukes_of_lithuania ) , apparently used in the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth during the reign of house vasa , 1587 -- 1668 . 
  variants during other reigns can be [ found here ] ( http://wappenwiki.org/index.php/the_kingdom_of_poland_and_the_grand_duchy_of_lithuania ) , if you 're interested . 
  an interesting coat of arms indeed , op . 
  where is it from ? 
  well that 's a stupid attitude . 
  having separate drinks for women and men . 
  everyone can enjoy whatever the fuck they want . 
  the porridge was for the * jultomten * , obviously !, 
   or * joulutonttu * in finnish . 
  ^ edit : we did n't do that , as we lived in an apartment building . 
  ~ ~ i 've heard that the porridge was supposed to be left outside , near the barn . 
  i guess that 's where the gnomes lived ? ~ ~ just asked my mother about this !, 
  they left the porridge outside , under the window , on the tall snow banks . 
  the bowl had mysteriously emptied during the night . 
  my mom lived in northern carelia as a child . 
  ( i think this tradition is pre-christian , by the way . ), 
  our christmas traditions are very alike . 
  not surprising , taken our common history together . 
  i do n't think bringing presents was the main duty of the goat at all . 
  they went from house to house , asking for leftovers . 
  in the pre-christian , pagan times it was a shamanitic thing . 
  nuuttipukki was thought to have transformed into a goat . 
  if anything , he came to scare the kids . 
  it 's funny we kept the name , despite the modern * joulupukki * being clearly santa claus . 
  i think the original comment was about the whole war , including all the atrocities , being a terrible event . 
  not just what the germans did . 
  no westerner has been accepted this , or last year , according to [ yle news ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/mita_ihmetta_yhdysvaltalaisia_hakee_turvapaikkaa_suomesta/8470677 ) [ in finnish ] . 
   it seems like they know that an attack is unavoidable , so they 're doing everything they can to minimise the number of casualties . 
  your logic is faulty . 
  if there 's a threat , of course they 'll encourage people to stay indoors . 
  what else should they tell them ? 
  it does n't mean the attack is unavoidable . 
  if it was , they 'd * order people to stay indoors * , instead of recommending it . 
   if i get drunk in finland at this point you have already begun the communication process of the finns . 
  you 'll do fine , friend , just fine . 
   what i meant was a religion that is not native to the area . 
  like christendom ? 
   religion , especially `` pagan '' religions i 'd like to point out that * pagan * , as a term , [ does n't include followers of islam ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pagan ) . 
  is he a very [ spirited ] ( https://translate.google.com/?source=osdd#fi/en/vilkas ) character ? 
  * someone 's on to us * ... ** abort , abort !, 
  i sure hope you 're not referring to finns with `` eastern swedes '' ... 
  surely refusing to join a coalition is not being responsible for war ? 
  the molotov -- ribbentrop pact had a secret protocol to * divide parts of europe * , between the ussr and germany . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious that the soviets were n't unresponsible , as they moved to try and make those plans come true . 
  they basically planned war with germany . 
  as someone already mentioned , the molotov -- ribbentrop pact was signed before the hostilities . 
  you do realize that responsibilities carry further than just hostile actions taken ? 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  that ussr could n't have responsibility because they took offensive action 17 days later ? 
  well , no , but are you implying they got their facts wrong in this case ? 
  i do , it 's built in there with rails , so it can be easily pulled out . 
  but do you have your drying rack [ built into the closet above the sink ] ( http://assets.dornob.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dish-hanging-hidden-rack.jpg ) ? 
  cause that 's what we finns have in every home . 
  right , because no military ever re-swore allegiance to a new master . 
  easy . 
  iceland just declares him a citizen , makes him a diplomat and * voila * , he has diplomatic immunity . 
  sahti itself comes from the germanic languages , including the swedish * saft * , meaning * juice * . 
  not `` home-brew '' , as the map suggests . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sahti * kalja * actually refers to a specific type of beer , * kotikalja * . 
  nowadays people do use it as a synonym for all beer , however . 
  it has a similar etymology to * olut * . 
   `` unitedstatesians '' does n't sound any better to be fair !, 
  it 's [ united statians ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/united_statian ) , not unitedstatesians . 
  no , [ findians . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/findians__the_story_of_finns_distant_cousins/9087943 ), 
  estonia is obviously a finnic country , that 's just a fact . 
  how could anyone argue against that ? 
  but finnic is n't a geographical term , really . 
  baltic however can be . 
  it refers to either the whole baltic region ; the traditonal three baltic states ; or the baltic peoples , aka the balts . 
  estonians are not a baltic people in the latter sense , like the latvians and lithuanians , but your country just happens to be situated there with them . 
  i think it 's a bit like when people say finland is part of scandinavia , yet we 're really not , neither geographically or ethnically . 
  i guess that 's why someone came up with the term * nordic * . 
  ( only to cause more confusion , really . ), 
  and talking of that , by all means , welcome to the nordics . 
   all three baltic states are already observer members of the nordic council .
