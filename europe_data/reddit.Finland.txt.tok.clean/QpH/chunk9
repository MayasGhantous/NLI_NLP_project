  scotland is n't , yet they sometimes want in too !, 
   no direct translation in finnish at all / u/h2ppyme already told you , but are you serious ? 
  you 've * never * heard the term * it\u00e4merensuomalaiset * ? 
  wait , does sweden let the people elect her prime minister ? 
  cause here in finland , the prime minister is elected by the parliament . 
  or is that you were talking about ? 
  you 're also a bit mistaken . 
  you 're looking for `` folktales '' . 
  folklore is more comprehensive : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folklore, 
  they 're obviously norwego-swedo-finno-russian languages , * duh * . 
  no , they do n't , really . 
  but i want to add * turkki * , turkey , just because turkki also means * fur * in finnish . 
  and to make it even funnier , * ankara * means * harsh * in finnish . 
  [ insert joke about how furry and harsh turks are ], 
  who says * kalsarik\u00e4nnit * ca n't involve saunas and/or knives ? 
  you do n't drink the beer in the sauna , but only after . 
  much more refreshing that way . 
  some people obviously drink beer in the sauna at home , but i doubt any pub allows you to carry glassware or glass bottles into the sauna . 
  they 're a safety hazard in sweaty , wet and drunken hands . 
  edit : apparently people ca n't into context . 
  `` you do n't drink beer in the sauna '' was obviously an answer to ... what i answered to :  how do you keep your beer cold in the sauna ? 
  people apparently ca n't read what i wrote after that , either , so i quote myself :  some people obviously drink beer in the sauna at home and it might come as a surpise to some finns , but not everyone likes to drink warm beer in the sauna , but cold beer afterwards . 
  it 's the younger folk that gets wasted in the sauna , instead of enjoying the l\u00f6yly the long route ( staying in there for more than 10 minutes ) and just relaxing after , with a beverage . 
  the ship was build in france , and is not used by a finnish company : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_harmony_of_the_seas so ... what are you talking about ? 
  i knew you guys wanted it !, 
   but she was swedish . 
  east-swedish . 
   i 'll go hide now ... you better hide , you little hurri . 
  we 'll come over , take your land and divide it amongst us , the norwegians and the danes . 
  we 'll even give a little piece to estonia , they need a a new island . 
  the other food , besides porridge , is pretty much the same we serve at schools . 
  * we literally feed our kids with it . 
  * that 's why it feels so fucking offensive . 
  it might be bland , but it 's nutritional and filling , and the seasoning jars are right next to it . 
  and if you 've really come from a war-torn place , why do you complain about * free fucking food * ? 
  i 'm insulted and angered at these people . 
  not only are they acting like little babies , they 're doing all kinds of harm to the * actual fucking refugees * . 
  there are people in need of help . 
  urgent help . 
  how are we supposed to help them when these freeloading fucks basically steal their spot in the line ? 
   lactose free milk is more expensive then almond or soya milk . 
  that depends on where you live . 
  here , in finland , lactose-free milk is cheaper than plant-based `` milks '' . 
  all kinds of milk-based , yet lactose-free products are widely available here . 
   literally taking the lactose sugars out of the milk there are two ways of producing lactose-free milk : the one you mentioned , and the use of * lactase * , a natural enzyme ( found in in the small intestine of lactose-tolerant humans and other mammals ) that 's used to break it down . 
  well ... three ways , actually . 
  the third one is fermentation . 
  for example , matured , hard cheese is naturally low in lactose ( or free of it ) , as the bacteria consumes the lactose while the produce matures . 
  does the other friend have a similar set of drinks , or what ? 
   britain  a nation choose one . 
  clearly , britain is a * country * with ( at least ) four * nations * within . 
  yes , yes , nitpicking . 
  i know . 
  ** what really happened : ** the man was * not trying to stab the pm * . 
  instead , after the pm asked the man what he could do for him , he kneeled in front of the pm , offering him the knife and telling him ( depending on the source ) '' ( to ) [ end his suffering ] ( http://www.savonsanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/il-veitsimiehelta-hyytava-vastaus-paaministeri-kataiselle/1262938 ) '' , or that '' [ i 'm here only pretending to kill you ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/veitsimies_sanoi_kataiselle_mina_tulin_leikisti_tappamaan_sinut/6345419 ) '' . 
  clearly it was an act of protest against his politics . 
  the whole thing was obviously misunderstood . 
  ask yourselves , does [ this really look that threatening ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article6345463.ece/alternates/w580/jyrki+katainen+puukko.jpg ) ? 
  edit : yes , the sources are in finnish . 
  ca n't help with that , as long as the foreign media keeps portraying this the way they do . 
  actually , it * should * contain the swastika . 
  we should n't allow some nazi bastards to defame this * [ ancient symbol ] ( http://reclaimtheswastika.com/history/ ) * . 
  you do n't seem to understand that the money is n't all gone when they cross the border . 
  it is * still being made after they do * . 
  it is * no longer made in france * after that point . 
  and of course i would not work for a vulture . 
  the problem here is that they 're allowed to take the 90 % in the first place !, 
  i say * no * to huge taxes , and * yes * to fair pay !, 
  they ca n't scrape the cream if they 're not allowed to be vultures in the first place . 
  we have minimum wages , how about ** maximum wages ** ? 
  i * am * on your side , i 'm posting * different ways of handling this * . 
  i 'm not spreading anyone 's propaganda , but saying how things unfortunately are . 
  i 'm on your side !, 
  the problem is they still * have the money * , no matter who makes it for them . 
  and if too much is taken from them , they go abroad and find * new workers * to reap the cream from , leaving the ones in france unemployed . 
  they wo n't be , if they leave and * move the companies with them * . 
  this has happened even before taxations . 
  ever seen stuff with `` made in china '' on it ? 
  they can take * themselves * out of france . 
  and it is * they * who make the money -- even after leaving france . 
  just let them ? 
  * just let them * ? 
  you think france does n't need their money ? 
  why are you being downvoted ? 
  i 'm afraid you 're right . 
  let 's hope that does n't happen . 
  i hope the french wo n't take this kind of `` justice '' lightly . 
  time to protest , patrie ? 
  exactly . 
  there 's a lot of * hate * and * hatecrime * in the ( muslim ) communities , but talking about is labeled racism and hatespeech !, 
  now we must admit there is a lot of that too , just blatant racist bastards using any excuse they can to attack the immigrants , but it makes me angry that ( partly because of the racists ) no one can speak out loud what they 're thinking . 
  the source is in finnish , but here you go : http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/maahanmuuttajat_yliedustettuina_helsingin/ and i would gladly deport the canadian and irishman aswell , if they were to rape someone or commit some other serious offence . 
  this is n't about just cultural differences , but being able to integrate on a personal level . 
  our cultural behaviour , however , is quite strong in us all and affects our personal behaviour a lot . 
  it is . 
  but hey , you have my upvote !, 
   well culture is learnt and can be changed  you want to know who 's really to blame ? 
  it 's the people that say `` these bloody immigrants just do n't integrate '' i totally agree with you !, 
  i 'm not one of those people , i 'm one of those who says * it has to be done properly * . 
  does n't look like it at the moment , but not talking about these issues is n't going to help either .
