except that `` puola '' and `` pula '' are different words . 
  vowels actually matter in finnish . 
  puola means wheelspoke , pula means shortage . 
  the immediate post-war period is commonly known as pula-aika . 
  there 's kind of an analogue with soviet citizenship . 
  the soviet union forcibly transferred people to ethnic states , and those people had children . 
  when it collapsed , you could end up in a foreign country without moving anywhere . 
  many brits live in the eu and would have never expected their own government to throw them under the bus like this . 
  -30 \u00b0 c does happen but -20 \u00b0 c already would be considered exceptionally cold in the south . 
  normal unexceptional winter weather would be -15 to 0 \u00b0 c , -10 to -5 \u00b0 c is best because it 's dry cold but still relatively easy to protect yourself against . 
  this is now talking about southern finland . 
  you 're probably just mispronouncing it . 
  english has usually penultimate stress , finnish has always initial stress . 
  also ` ee ' does n't exist in english , especially unstressed ( ` ei ' does ) . 
  400 or 500 ml .

  yesterday i saw `` gay '' written on the snow on the back window of a car . 
  could n't this be solved much simpler like this : brits living on the small island off the coast of france could simply move into [ other british islands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/united_kingdom_%28%2boverseas_territories_and_crown_dependencies%29_in_the_world_%28single_zoom%29.svg/1280px-united_kingdom_%28%2boverseas_territories_and_crown_dependencies%29_in_the_world_%28single_zoom%29.svg.png ) , and the territory would return to its rightful owner , france . 
  but does n't that convert everyone into a brit abroad ? 
  you have to have an official copy . 
  pdf or even reprinted copies do n't count . 
  in principle , any copy can have errors . 
  ceta was actually a canadian-finnish-swedish conspiracy . 
  think of all the pulp and paper needed . 
  no but you can make one : lainakalsarik\u00e4nnit `` borrowed underwear drunkenness '' . 
  i liked the finnish teekkarikyl\u00e4 term * vaimoke * . 
  vaimo = wife , but * - ke * is a derivative suffix for things utilized for the stated purpose ( e.g. 
  * hy\u00f6ty * `` benefit '' , * hy\u00f6dyke * '' ( economic ) good '' ) . 
  so a * vaimoke * is any female partner that effectively functions as a wife , regardless of the formal or legal status . 
  * - ke * is also usually used for small inanimate but necessary things , e.g. 
  * kirjake * '' [ sort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sort_\\ ( typesetting \\ ) ) '' , so it 's kind of hacker humor . 
  unfortunately , it does n't have a male equivalent , though , because there 's really no direct equivalent to the english word `` husband '' in finnish . 
  well , you have * aviomies * but that 's the precise legal term , people usually just use the word * mies * ( `` man '' ) . 
  well the pig 's head is at least on a table with a tablecloth on it . 
  that 's progress . 
  they used to be sold right from the back of a van in the wild 90s . 
  ( / s. . . but i was on a student trip to russia and the first thing we did when entering russia was illegal ( ? ), 
  currency exchange from the back of a van . ), 
  totally hypothetical question because of the american nuclear umbrella . 
  but it 's a good question , western ground forces are n't what they used to be . 
  if the eu worked like a country , then approximate parity in numbers could be achieved . 
  likely it would be extremely costly and would n't benefit either side in any way . 
  what i mean is that while u.s. interests can certainly use ( and do use ) the eu apparatus to further their own interest , it 's not something they can do with impunity ; you have thousands of other stakeholders , including european industry , european interest groups , european political groups like greens and consumer rights advocates , and various other groups that try to affect the process `` extrademocratically '' , and then the democratic process itself . 
  well not directly , but there is kaliningrad , suursaari , whatever they have in moldova , and of course , crimea . 
  also , leningrad military district is pretty heavily armed , and the alliance with belarus means they can get pretty close to eu territory . 
  this does have a destabilizing effect on eu and nato unity , and they know it . 
  besides , the us does support the eu . 
  it 's a multilateral trade treaty that removes a lot of technical barriers to trade from us companies . 
  ttip is n't the first or last time when american interests try to push something through the eu . 
  similar things happened with software patents earlier . 
  the `` problem '' is that the eu is n't completely undemocratic , though , and can do things the us does not like ( reach being a case in point ) . 
  this is what i thought too . 
  in finland , everyone is * supposed * to learn swedish , but the actual success rate is 41 % . 
  language learning is actually pretty bad in finland , because most people just learn english , force themselves through the swedish tests ( which mainly concentrate on minutiae of grammar and not actually knowing how to speak the language ) and leave it at that . 
  it 's a shame that finns do n't learn german , french , russian or other useful languages . 
  i see , i usually have noscript on and did n't see it has a comment section . 
  but anyway , other than the couple of `` it 's a jewish conspiracy '' and `` hang them all ! '', 
  expectable for an unmoderated forum , i do n't see that much of it . 
  i expected it to be 100 % bile and tinfoil . 
  the main reason was that france wanted to put eu funds into north africa , but you ca n't do that without the eu , thus , create another organization including the eu and the target countries . 
  could define this `` hate '' and provide examples instead of throwing accusations ? 
   these people have not even done anything wrong no , it was quite clear from the article that the family entered denmark illegally . 
  if you try to avoid or circumvent legal immigration protocols , it 's a wrongdoing and you 're a criminal . 
  the sentence for aiding was pretty dumb - if we read just the information provided by guardian , which only includes the point of view of the accused . 
  it 's equally possible that she was doing this on purpose or as a deliberate provocation . 
   that 's sure to help with integration criminals need no integration , they need deportation . 
   treating them not even as citizens , well because they are n't , duh . 
   but as intruders even before you 've even judged their actual asylum application . 
  this is where it gets hairy . 
  it looks these were cut-and-dry dublin cases from the outset . 
  if laws and treaties were followed , they were supposed to be returned to their point of origin . 
  yet danish police allowed them to walk to sweden , which is a dublin violation and patently illegal . 
  sweden accepted them which is also a dublin violation and patently illegal . 
  both effectively assisted human traffickers , yet only one participant in the case was punished . 
  nobody gets a clean report from this case . 
  also , i do not have to judge their asylum application . 
  that is the job of the government of the country that processes their asylum application . 
  this showcases how the eu asylum system is critically broken and needs immediate fixing . 
  leftists supporting open borders and letting people in indiscriminately are in effect pushing people to vote for anti-european populists , which endangers the integrity and stability of the eu . 
  do we really need another '' [ br ] exit '' ? 
  do i have to personally crash a car before i have the permission to start wearing seatbelts ? 
  it 's called preventive action . 
  by the way , i 've had some experiences with attempted home intrusions , although the culprits were natives . 
  but there are enough drug addicts and others that can support themselves only through crime , there is no good reason to protect a population that can not earn any money legitimately . 
  everyone is not aiding illegal immigration , though . 
  we 're not looking at benign people here ; whatever the case with this , generally the criminals that arrange illegal immigration are hardened , organized criminals that exploit the hell out of their victims , the trafficked persons . 
  create an exception for old ladies with cookies and you 're inadvertently creating an exception for them , too . 
  the term `` illegal immigrant '' is loaded in the first place . 
  that assumes they have the right to immigrate but incidentally their act appears to be illegal . 
  completely ass-backwards way of defining a rather serious crime directed at the sovereignity of the country . 
  what if other crimes were downplayed like this ? 
  it undermines the legitimacy of the rules and regulations in place to ensure that no dangerous people can enter , and that immigration does not militate against the national interest . 
  an `` illegal immigrant '' should be called something like `` intruder '' instead . 
  they 're not just `` people '' , they 're * threats * . 
  i suspect expediency . 
  there was really no religious freedom in the modern sense , a large orthodox population gained by conquest was just something they had to bear . 
  i 'm feeling nitpicky . 
  war * does * change . 
  we have n't had a proper nuclear war yet ( both sides nuclear-armed ) and nobody has been willing to try . 
  that * is * change .
