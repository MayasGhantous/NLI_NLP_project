  it is at least accurate with respect to sweden in this map . 
  politics is why this is so . 
  the centre party in finland gives a lot of money to remote regions , so that they remain inhabited . 
  unfortunately , this means people do n't move with labor demand . 
  in contrast , capitalism has been left run unchecked in sweden and russia , which have been strongly urbanized . 
  the thing has an actual use , too . 
  the soxhlet extractor is one connected to a condenser . 
  it 's used to remove waxes , pitch and other soluble compounds ( extractives ) from wood or other biomass samples for analysis or science . 
  the sample is put into a paper `` sock '' , which is put into the cup . 
  solvent ( acetone for example ) is vaporized from a bulb into the condenser , from where it drips into the cup . 
  eventually the cup is filled , and it drains back into the bulb . 
  now , the same solvent can be reused : it again evaporates , is condensed in the condenser , fills the cup and so on . 
  because the extraction is repeated even sparingly soluble compounds are removed . 
  extractives are n't necessarily interesting on their own right , but they can interfere with analysis of polymers in the sample . 
  no , yule goats were young people that used to walk from house to house in costumes with goat horns and a mask . 
  they 'd rather ask for presents instead of giving them and were ribald rather than kid-friendly . 
  today the coca cola guy ( the modern santa claus ) gives presents but he 's still called * joulupukki * `` yule goat '' . 
  the swedish goat may be related , but it 's not the same tradition . 
  where exactly ? 
  although it 's called christmas in english , it 's older than christianity . 
  in the nordic countries it 's still called yule . 
  and the santa is not called a saint but literally yule goat in finland . 
  in finland , christmas is big . 
  24-26th are holidays and many take 23th and 27-31th off with movable vacation days if they have them . 
  most celebrations on the 24th , and it 's usually very strictly with ( immediate ) family . 
  on 24th , there 's christmas sauna which is unusually in the day , not the night . 
  after that there 's christmas dinner and gift-giving . 
  dinner has ham and a very specific set of foods nobody eats otherwise : swede , carrot and potato casserole , beetroot salad ( rosolli ) and herring . 
  edit : and how did i forget liver casserole , gravlax , small beer and bread ( * joululimppu * , a swedish-style dark , syrup-sweetened loaf . ) . 
  ( i am not a fan but many think it 's important to maintai tradition . ), 
  for gift-giving , santa visits the house personally ; it 's either a relative in disguise ( i 've been one once even ) or a hired professional santa ( seen that too ) . 
  church is then on 25th , otherwise there 's little programming for that day , but you do n't leave your house . 
  arguably the only sabbath actually observed . 
  on 26th , visiting other houses is traditional . 
  west coast finns have a tradition of the end of the summer cottage season party ( * huvilakauden p\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4j\u00e4iset * ) at the last weekend in august , celebrated by fireworks . 
  no special notice to the police/fire department is required for the fireworks - but only in those regions with this tradition ( green ) . 
  in other parts ( red ) it 's a regular day and a permission from the authorities is required . 
  i moved from a green region into a red region and noticed something missing . 
  i knew the carpathian basin was flat but wow . 
  matters that are important enough for foreign governments to comment on are obviously reported more in international news . 
  nordic countries all have lions because the folkunga royal family had that in their coat of arms . 
  there 's an [ even longer list ] ( http://www.sci.fi/~alphabet/paikka.html ) , and there are several . 
  you forgot the persevuori/perselampi/perselahti system ( arse mountain , arse pond and arse bay ) for instance . 
  also , to nitpick , the word `` siitin '' is anachronistic if translated as `` penis '' . 
  it refers to a siida , a sami village . 
  the medical neologism `` siitin '' ( siitt\u00e4\u00e4 = to sire , - in = implement , i suspect this might be 19th or even 20th century ) is new compared to the place names themselves . 
  as for `` vitunvihelt\u00e4m\u00e4aapa '' ( `` aapa mire whistled by a cunt '' ) and the like , this is a characteristically northern/lapland pattern . 
  a lot of these places are little ponds nobody particularly cares about , but there 's lemu ( `` stink '' ) , which was an actual municipality . 
  also , the village of myrkky ( `` poison '' ) near tiukka ( `` tight '' ) , and the lake iso-melanen ( `` the one with a big penis '' ) . 
  it 's actually [ kildin sami ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kildin_sami_language ) to be precise . 
  kildin sami is spoken in russia , and the word came to english through russian . 
  it makes sense in finnish/estonian too : tundar - fjell/open country , tundra - of the fjell ( should be an abbreviation through something like `` tundaran '' - `` tundran '' - `` tundra '' , in a similar pattern as in the estonian genitive ) . 
  russian loaned the word as is out of context and carried it forward as is , which is why it 's not `` tundar '' in english . 
   finland  salad somebody has n't been doing their homework ... 
  plain concrete is fine in a hot climate where it rarely rains . 
  but it 's goes nasty-ass dirty in a decade in a wet climate like we have here in the nordics . 
  [ this delight ] ( http://vaasanyt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_1705.jpg ) , for example , is a church . 
  notice the leaching of iron/other metal ions and the red stains it causes . 
  hilarious , it 's like fingerpori 's [ combined fitness center and solarium ] ( http://www.hs.fi/webkuva/taysi/1920/1349774753984?ts=239 ) . 
  i saw a similar weird arrangement in a u.s. hotel . 
  fine , there was a bathroom that was apparently moisture-sealed , but it did n't have a sink . 
  the sink was in a separate `` beauty room '' that had no sealing whatsoever , a wall-to-wall carpet , and it was actually open to the rest of the apartment , no doors or anything . 
  so you apparently never ever spill anything when washing with a sink , and it 's ok for everyone to see . 
  there was a door between the bathroom and the `` beauty room '' . 
  no way that doorhandle is going to be clean ... 
  there 's something funny about the map . 
  for example , the gulf of bothnia in the baltic sea has a very gently sloping east coast , so it would sink quite a lot - but there 's nothing about that on the map . 
  [ this ] ( http://s.ngm.com/2013/09/rising-seas/gatefold/rs_web_eu_8m_v3.jpg ) gives a better idea . 
  * right-sizing * tax payments . 
  has happened in finland too . 
  punk band klamydia 's song * metanol man * is inspired by a true story of a man who mixed methanol ( which is cheaper ) into the ethanol he was selling as illegal booze . 
  it tastes like butter and not much else . 
  for a genuine no-taste cheese , try cheap finnish imitation edam . 
  well there was this adolf guy who put some effort into that . 
  do n't forget the arabs allied against the turks !, 
  there have been no actual rescues from the top of mt. 
  everest as of yet . 
  ergo , it was not possible in 1970 either . 
  indeed . 
  when someone dies at an altitude higher than 8000 m , you do n't need any other explanation . 
  it 's known by the friendly name `` death zone '' . 
  because , if you stop , you die . 
  helicopters ca n't get enough lift to fly this high , and other people have enough work lifting themselves up . 
  alone , in a snowstorm , without equipment , you could carry another person maybe a few meters if any . 
  in the documentary series * everest * , when a mountaineer was found dying up there , they had to abandon him because the expedition leader estimated that you 'd need 20 sherpas to carry him back down . 
  also known as the `` artist '' ? 
  democracy does n't produce the right decisions , it produces the decisions the people deserve . 
  or , a bit easier , use vector drawing software such as inkscape or illustrator by placing the image as a pattern in a drawing object in the shape of the country .

  not just west in general but / u/7leagueboots could visit the archipelago . 
  it 's essentially always windy and cool , even on hot days . 
  for example kvarken archipelago or turku / saaristomeri archipelago . 
  i bet you are really popular with your toxic comments . 
  in sanskrit the corresponding word is `` priya '' , which shows how it can end up as `` perja '' in finnish . 
  but lauka/laua is not the finnish word for washing , it appears meaningless . 
  ( in english there 's the word `` lavage '' , in contrast . ), 
  wash is `` pesu '' and bath is `` kylpy '' . 
  sadly , the same has happened to a lot of uralic languages as well .
