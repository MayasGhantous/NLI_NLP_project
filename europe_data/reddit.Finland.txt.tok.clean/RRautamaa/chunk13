  the total welfare budget is the residual difference : total welfare budget = total spending - total net salaries . 
  remember that proper income-earning people wo n't get to keep any of it because it will be taxed away . 
  for the sake of argument assume 90 % full-time and 10 % unemployed . 
  then , each * unemployed * person would receive # 1000 / 10 % = # 10000 a year * net * . 
  the benefit of ubi is that it meshes very well with taxation : the marginal income ( i.e. 
  derivative of net income per income earned ) from working is always positive . 
  the current system creates traps where the marginal income is zero or even negative . 
  you 're leaping to conclusions even before you 've read the premise ... 
  fact is , in the countries involved , it 's usually practically possible to get some sort of benefits . 
  but they 're highly bureaucratic , inconsistent , ad hoc and create welfare traps . 
  ubi is n't really some completely new ufo thing , it 's a method to replace current ineffective , expensive and unfair policy . 
  well the eu rejected morocco once ... 
  but really , you 're just making shit up with claims like `` eu lets anyone to join '' . 
  it is a political project and new memberships are always a very politically sensitive issue . 
  if eu let `` anyone '' to join , why are n't turkey and turkish-occupied parts of cyprus already members ? 
  as for border policy , eu did n't immediately lead to opening borders , schengen is a separate animal . 
  the criterion for freely allowing in nationals from a certain country is that their stay is generally for legal reasons and if there was a visa process , there would be very few rejected visas . 
  this is not an ideological battle , it 's a practical concern . 
  somehow the private insurance death panel is at least 4000 % better ... 
  in finland , i 've already seen the word `` paperittomat '' ( undocumented ) being regularly used by the government channel yle . 
  it 's obviously a word taken straight from international green/left anti-border activist vocabulary , and it 's troubling to see a supposedly neutral channel to use it . 
  even the word `` laiton maahanmuuttaja '' , which is a 1:1 calque of `` illegal immigrant '' , is highly misleading . 
  the term assumes that immigration is an unavoidable fact and that the * person * is somehow `` illegal '' . 
  but a foreigner ( `` ulkomaalainen '' , the only term known in finnish law ) does n't have a general right to stay in the country absent an exception specifically enumerated in law . 
  they 're neither illegal ( `` laiton '' would be nonsensical as applied to a person ) nor immigrants ( `` maahanmuuttaja '' , literally person moving into the country ) . 
  the precise and neutral legal term is `` maassa laittomasti oleskeleva ulkomaalainen '' ( a foreign person illegally staying in the country ) . 
  in fact , the law does n't even ( obviously ) use the term `` laiton '' ( illegal ) but speaks only about `` foreign persons staying in the country without a required travel document , visa or permanent residence card '' ( see [ ulkomaalaislaki ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20040301 ) 185 \u00a7 , also see 148 \u00a7 and 149 \u00a7 for denial of entry and deportation ) . 
  breaking the law is a misdemeanor , you do n't become an outlaw , but you can be subjected to administrative action to remove you from the country involuntarily . 
  the difference is important because if it was a crime , in principle you could sit through your sentence and then apply again a free man . 
  the law instead gives authorization for administrative actions , which can be applied at any time , for an unlimited time , at the discretion of the officer in charge . 
  bah , that 's practically vegetarian with all the pizza dough and tomato . 
  make a proper cordon bleu ( wrap cheese and ham in steak pounded thin , bread and fry ) . 
  reform seems to mean eu reform , in the sense that the eu is dismantled as far as possible . 
  funny though what happened to soini of finns party . 
  up to that point , allying with tories was a high point in his career , a culmination of all power fantasies he had . 
  now tories will leave the parliament , and halla-aho or terho will become the new party leader , so they 'll probably have to ally with [ efdd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_freedom_and_direct_democracy ) again ( i.e. 
  the ukip , sverigedemokraterna etc. 
  crowd ) . 
  nykysuomen etymologinen sanakirja defines er\u00e4maa as a `` separate and distant land '' in original meaning . 
  er\u00e4 does n't mean hunting , it is a fenno-saamic word that means `` separate '' , `` portion '' , ref . 
  same . 
  so your theory there is false . 
  er\u00e4stys is by the looks of it a 20th century neologism . 
  specifically , a moist-ground , moss-floored ( intermediate between a bog and a forest ) spruce forest , known for its darkness and desolateness . 
  it 's quite natural for the standard for desolateness to be set by a type of forest in finnish , because there are no dry deserts in finland . 
  treelessness is caused by coldness , not dryness : alpine tundra in fell country ( tunturi ) is the only type of open `` desert '' . 
  er\u00e4maa is another word for desolation . 
  but funnily it literally means `` portion-land '' , because in land partitions for a village , the surrounding uncultivated land was also divided into portions , where the owners could hunt , collect wood and otherwise make use of the land . 
  er\u00e4maa was divided separately so it was not connected to the titular plot ; it could be miles away in the forest . 
  this in part explains how finns hunt and own so much forest privately , even a pulp and paper company ( mets\u00e4 group ) . 
  the urheimat of slavic languages is an area just south or southeast of lithuania , about the same size . 
  slavs expanded to their current area relatively recently . 
  russia for example was inhabited by finnic peoples , now driven into a minority , russified or extinct ; it 's still continuing today . 
  but the cyrillic alphabet is from bulgaria , so maybe the oldest historical slavic state is bulgaria . 
  so etymologically it 's in the germanic/scandinavian camp : proto-germanic `` authas '' becomes `` autio '' meaning `` desolate '' . 
  `` maa '' means `` land '' . 
  see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logos ) . 
  things that are awkward and difficult to say in one language can be quick and natural in another . 
  for example , greek has the word * logos * that ( in biblical contexts ) many authors just do n't translate . 
  in finnish you might say `` oon ** k\u00e4ynnistelem\u00e4ss\u00e4 ** t\u00e4t\u00e4 '' without blinking while you might have to translate that into `` i am ** slowly and discontinuously attempting to try to start up ** this '' to get a complete translation - but you would n't say the same in the same context in english . 
  although , this list here contains about a third obviously artificially made-to-be-difficult words like `` k\u00e4yt\u00e4nn\u00f6llistelem\u00e4ll\u00e4\u00e4nkink\u00f6 '' . 
  the ones on the lower right are mostly these . 
  also , finnish has a construct where you can replace a subsidiary clause completely with one word if its actors can be referred to with personal forms only . 
  for example , `` k\u00e4ynnistelless\u00e4ni '' means `` when i was starting up , i ... '' . 
  these might seem complicated but forming them is n't much more difficult than regular agglutination for case and person ( - ssa `` in '' , - ni `` mine '' ) . 
  english is very analytic meaning you have to break it down into six words , but that 's just a convention . 
  the original form is * k\u00e4y * , not * k\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4 * , which is derived . 
  the archaic meaning of `` k\u00e4yd\u00e4 '' is `` to walk '' , but the form * k\u00e4vell\u00e4 * is nowadays used for literal walking and `` k\u00e4yd\u00e4 '' for being adequate , accepted or allowed ( e.g. 
  visa k\u00e4y `` visa accepted '' ) , visiting a place ( k\u00e4yn viem\u00e4ss\u00e4 roskat `` i 'll take out the trash '' ) , or for motors , running ( moottori k\u00e4y ) . 
  multiple meanings is normal : it 's kind of like the english word `` run '' : run 100 m , run for office , run the country , run the ad , run guns , run an engine , running river , run a red light , run a test , run a wire , running nose , running river etc. 
  does n't it have dual meaning ? 
  the literal translation would be `` check '' or `` audit '' , its original meaning , from latin * [ contrarotulum ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contr%c3%b4le#french ) * `` counter-roll ( for verifying accounts ) '' . 
  it 's used in this meaning in the english phrase `` controlled variable '' , also there ' the related term '' [ comptroller ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comptroller ) '' . 
  it 's odd though as his royal lineage is french and not even of royal extraction originally . 
  no viking helmets involved . 
  in many european countries , there are lay judges , sometimes as a majority in courts of first instance . 
  the professional judge functions as the chairman . 
  so it 's not as different as it appears . 
  that is only assuming that the russian landmass is removed from existence in a blip , without replacing it with water or dumping it somewhere . 
  but if you dig it up and dump it into the arctic sea , the quantity of water would n't change and so the sea level would stay constant . 
  it 's kind of odd to blame finland for it , since the allies were behind leaving finland to the soviet sphere of influence . 
  especially the british made sure that finland was sufficiently punished for ww2 . 
  even so , president kekkonen worked hard to get finland join the eec ; it did n't go through in full but as a bilateral treaty , although with essentially similar effect as fully joining . 
  prosperity came from export trade , and it would 've been odd to join the economically backward soviet bloc . 
  in finland , alko is closed for easter too so no strong drinks for sale at all . 
  funny that the sale of beer is also prohibited between 21-9 , so stores have metal articulated riot doors to close up the beer shelves at 9 pm , even when the store itself stays open . 
  one thing that 's easily ignored by foreigners praising the `` liberalism '' in northern europe is that there are some things where they are still extremely conservative . 
  for example , in finland , back in the 1990s everything was closed for easter . 
  even today you ca n't get strong alcohol on easter because alko , the governmental alcohol retail monopoly store , is closed . 
  this regulation has a history in a strong temperance movement that even got a prohibition through for a decade ( 1919-1932 ) . 
  in finland the washing machine ( and its water outlets ) are always in the bathroom . 
  when you handle soiled clothes and large amounts of water , particularly dirty water , it 's better to do it in a room with a waterproof floor and a floor drain . 
  putting it into the kitchen is a british oddity . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4d1mr7g1kbe/vql-wtyncsi/aaaaaaaae5e/nl355nhev8k/s1600/2578880-nuke%252bit.jpg ) ? 
  no but there are two types of people in the world : those who do n't recognize when they 're being trolled . 
  we should just promote global warming . 
  rising sea levels would submerge the area between finland and russia , submerging also st. petersburg in the process . 
  a channel would form between the gulf of finland and the white sea , which would allow clean oceanic water to enter , solving a lot of environmental problems . 
  oh shit a map without ingria , karelia and petsamo .
