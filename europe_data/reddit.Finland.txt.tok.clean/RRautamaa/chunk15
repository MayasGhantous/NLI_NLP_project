  technically , the finnish government is fully sovereign in \u00c5land and could do whatever it wants , but in practice , \u00c5land 's special status is respected , and governors are always swedish-speaking . 
  the finnish vat is not levied on \u00c5land , so between finland and \u00c5land there can be tax-free trade . 
  the demilitarized status means that \u00c5land citizens are exempt from conscription . 
  they would n't let even finnish naval vessels to land when assisting in rescue operations . 
  peacetime border guarding can be pain because the native force has been sometimes apparently deliberately slow with assisting the military . 
  in practice , in case of war , finland will immediately occupy \u00c5land , as this has happened in every war in the past . 
  this is why sometimes pleasure boats manned by a rather homogeneous bunch of men with short hair and fit build , `` on vacation '' , can be seen , showing rather naval flag signals . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/sienet/11.html ) , 40 % of finns did it in 2002 , or more than 50 % in eastern regions . 
  it 's also a `` smart people 's hobby '' , because higher-educated people are more likely to do it . 
  a lot of chanterelles , [ boletus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus ) and [ deadmen 's trumpets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craterellus_cornucopioides ) for example . 
  it is true . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_genetic_structure_\\ ( based_on_snps \\ ) _ pc_analysis . png ) europeans are compared to chinese ( chb ) , japanese ( jpt ) and yoruba ( yri ) . 
  finns fit well within the european subpool . 
  there was a pretty good thread about this in / r/europe : / r/europe/comments / 4yecwq/according _ to_a_recent_genetic_variation_analysis / and really , i 'm not talking about genetics as is , but that the [ ural-altaic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural%e2%80%93altaic_languages ) / [ turanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turanid_race ) theory fails to die , particularly on the internet . 
  19th century thinking was that language and genetics were the same , but today it 's understood there no 1:1 correspondence between them : both europeans and asians speak uralic languages , just as both europeans and asians speak indo-european languages . 
  also , strict scientific requirements for what constitutes a language family were invented , and enforced , only much later . 
  * finns are all alcoholics who drink a lot all the time . ^ 1 * finns are genetically `` mongolian '' . ^ 2 * finland was somehow part of the soviet union ( there are variations of this ) . ^ 3 * finland is arctic tundra . ^ 4 then the more quacky ones like polar bears in finland , but i do n't think anybody discussed these seriously . 
  1 ) the average alcohol consumption rate is rather similar to the eu average . 
  constant drinking on weekdays or drinking on the job is frowned upon in finnish culture . 
  2 ) the `` ural-altaic '' or `` turanian '' connection is an 19th century theory now considered pseudoscientific . 
  modern genetic research shows finns are clearly a part of the european population . 
  3 ) i think the soviet connection comes from general ignorance . 
  4 ) only some very northermost parts have alpine tundra , meaning that it 's the altitude that makes it tundra . 
  lapland is sub-arctic and altitude permitting , covered in boreal forest . 
  to get true arctic tundra , you have to go to russia . 
  finland [ gets the peak of halti ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/norway-finland-move-mountain-halti-halditsohkka-highest-peak ) from norway if all goes well . 
  besides that , there might be some [ j\u00e4niskoski-niskakoski ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4niskosken%e2%80%93niskakosken_alue#/media/file:petsamo.png ) type land sale with russia , but i doubt that amounts to anything . 
  russia is very inflexible with borders , and i doubt it will weakened enough even in 100 years that they could be changed with war . 
  as for what points could be of interest , enso was put pretty arbitrarily on the russian side and given the angry-sounding name '' [ svetogorsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svetogorsk ) '' . 
  neither , really . 
  many in the older generation see only soviet people , and since we 're not talking about very rational prejudices in the first place , that 's unlikely to change . 
  also , gangsters in the early 90s did n't help . 
  yet , there 's also pan-finnic national kinship . 
  finns have been much more willing to help estonians than say , russians , in post-soviet hardships . 
  finns would like to see estonia succeed . 
  finns have been curious about and willing to travel to estonia in large numbers , so there is plenty of direct contact . 
  also , attitudes towards estonian immigrants are much better compared to other immigrants . 
  finns have a work ethic and see that estonians are here to work . 
  with respect to language , estonian sounds `` elated '' thanks to its tonal accent . 
  [ this commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ngiluxnqps ) is deliberately exploiting this . 
  also , many words are similar but have different meanings . 
  among finnish dialects , the [ turku dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_tvp-buh4m ) or [ rauma dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi3mynhyh34 ) is the closest to estonian . 
  only 1-2 % do not trust them at all . 
  from what i 've seen , it 's only career criminals and people associated with them who develop a hate for the police . 
  this is supported by the previous source , which shows that more than 50 % ( 56 % ) people who have more than 4 negative contacts with the police start to mistrust them . 
  ( and think about it - who will have more than 4 contacts with the police ? ), 
  different types of negative experiences are reported in 11-20 % contacts . 
  this is not necessarily simply because the police in finland is the best . 
  looking at the source , there is a suggestion of a negative correlation between the trust in police and resources spent on police per gdp . 
  that is , in finland , police spending per gdp is very low and the trust is high , while in countries with higher police spending , trust is lower . 
  what does this mean ? 
  if basic security is better , and the welfare state is willing to spend money to reduce the causes of crime , the society is safer and less police funding is needed . 
  that being said , levels of police corruption * are * extremely low . 
  if it was an explicit question , likely it would be even higher . 
  murderers who killed children and/or paedophiles are such that for example there have been attacks on the street on people mistaken for [ jammu-set\u00e4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jammu_siltavuori ) , and jammu himself was attacked in prison . 
  quite recently , a man who murdered his family was killed in prison by fellow inmates . 
  a man who torture-murdered his daughter was also threatened by many after the sentence was announced , and many complain about the mild punishment that the finnish state can give ( [ see here ] ( http://keskustelu.suomi24.fi/t/11957145/touko-tarkki ) ) . 
  i do n't think any other crime would generate this unique sort of blind hate . 
  people are generally content with the processing of other criminals , although the mild punishments that finland has have little support . 
  i can talk only about the scientific career , but there are some important differences : * a basic student ( this undergraduate/graduate thing does n't exist in here , you 're a basic student until you have a master 's ) is treated much more patronizingly ; more as a kid and not an adult . 
  you could n't have a thing like `` campus police '' in here . 
  * doctoral students and to a degree postdocs are treated very poorly . 
  anyone in their right mind would n't go there . 
  sorry , thanks for the offer , no deal . 
  here they get an employment contract and actual pay . 
  not very high pay , but regular pay . 
  * the american postdoctoral/midcareer system is * extremely * workaholic . 
  anyone moving there must be there for some serious upgrading of their cv , otherwise this does n't make much sense . 
  * americans take their field and topic very seriously . 
  they 're hyper-nerds . 
  this is both a good and a bad thing . 
  good because it leads to excellency in professional development . 
  bad because all work and no play makes a johnny a dull boy . 
  that means that all that work may not be as effective as it could be . 
  generally , the overview is that there must be some crucial benefit gained from working there . 
  moving there completely just because it 's america used to be a thing , but it is n't anymore . 
  what has vinegar to do with it ? 
  iodine is an essential element , and it 's not a given that a particular diet contains enough of it . 
  europeans do n't eat seaweed like the japanese , because it removes the problem completely . 
  fish and shellfish , milk and potatoes are usually enough , but not necessarily , if the diet is low in them . 
  adding iodine to salt is an easy way to make sure there enough of it . 
  mind you , danes are legendary for oversalting everything . 
  but the part about sweetness is true . 
  once i was in an american restaurant and they had a buffet with meatballs and sauce . 
  i was thinking , this is going to be great . 
  and the sauce was sweet . 
  and so were the very moist , crumbly , big meatballs . 
  most disgusting combination you could think of . 
  could n't eat it . 
  anyway , about american cuisine you think about similarly to asian cuisine . 
  it 's nice to eat it once a week , but it gets old if you eat it every day . 
  when i was at a conference in the u.s. , the only place i could find a tolerable breakfast for example was the hyper-healthy hippie dingd\u00e4ng in starbucks . 
  other options being a very expensive continental hotel breakfast or some diner stuff that was n't up to it . 
  holy shit , it 's real , not a joke or a comedy skit done by someone else . 
  this a very technical point , i think . 
  you can be patriotic towards a non-nationalist state - consider soviet patriotism , the country was multiethnic and multinational and explicitly anti-nationalist . 
  but in europe , in many countries nationbuilding has been nationalist , sometimes very explicitly , so being a patriotic is the same thing as being a nationalist . 
  in principle , someone could be able to campaign for a referendum in finland . 
  currently , it has collected [ 24,548 signatures ] ( https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/aloite/2058 ) out of the 50,000 required , which is a respectable result : at the current rate , they 'll reach the goal within a week and a day . 
  with 50,000 signatures , the parliament must discuss it .
