  [ fine too . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sipil%c3%a4_cabinet ) i think the only actually impossible combination stated by the parties involved is true finns and greens . 
  it 's because no party is able to get a majority for themselves , and even two parties is usually impossible and even if so , not a good idea because even a small break in party discipline could undo orderly government policymaking . 
  governments aim at a representation of ca . 
  this is accomplished by writing a `` government platform '' , a list of things the parties are supposed to vote on together under party discipline . 
  some things like nuclear power and gay rights are left out and are not debated exclusively on government-opposition lines . 
  too injured to survive . 
  reindeer are n't kept indoors in well-controlled conditions , they mostly survive on their own . 
  this is a proxy conflict between serbia and croatia also . 
  serbia is using one side for its interests , just like russia is using transdnistria . 
  blocking entrance to parliamentaries from a supposedly friendly country is * not * bringing it up ? 
  what * is * bringing it up then ? 
  condoning , contrafactually denying or downplaying abuse is an invitation for more of the same . 
  this is why it 'd be a huge deal if for example a holocaust denialist was elected german chancellor . 
  but have the same thing in turkey and alarmingly , very little of practical consequence happens . 
  this `` land by the river '' trick may sound like nothing but a little chuckle , until you consider how it actually worked for transdnistria . 
  why is turkey still an eu candidate ?!? 
  the first rule of the eu is that you do n't bring up the world wars and any revanche you might want . 
  the directive makes little sense for several reasons : * this is unambiguously a member state matter , because it 's in the competence of security , enforcement and national defense . 
  the eu does not have , and should not have , competence in this policy area , only excluding voluntary participation ( e.g. 
  if you want to generate more anti-eu sentiment , sure , try to overstep these boundaries . 
  * the directive seems to be another against `` scary looking guns '' . 
  for example , in finland , it is common to train army reservists who have their own rifles . 
  since the rk 62 or rk 95 are not for civilian sale , they usually buy an ar-15 or similar , modified to semiautomatic . 
  * this will have no effect on its intended target . 
  the guns used in the paris attacks were stolen / `` obtained '' post-soviet guns , with little connection to legal european gun ownership . 
  to solve this problem , why do n't you go and un-collapse the soviet union ... 
  why ? 
  well this is the thing . 
  with some real world data , it 's not just talk , talk , talk . 
  medieval finland looked quite different from today . 
  the area around helsinki was sparsely inhabited until the 13th century . 
  main population centers were turku , porvoo and viipuri , and even they were rather small cities . 
  the growth of helsinki started somewhere in the 16th century , and it took until the 19th century and a russian decree to grow it beyond turku . 
  it was turku and other cities with [ staple rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/staple_right ) that could do extensive foreign trade . 
  so , it was n't as if there were no connections , it was because there were very few people to connect to . 
   perhaps it 's just historical trade connections with random mixing between the two populations ? 
  pretty much this . 
  earlier there were theories about a massive migration , but those are considered discredited today . 
  the thing to remember is that in the olden days , land travel was much more difficult than sea travel . 
  there were no roads , and it was mostly walking how you got somewhere . 
  so , the connection over sea brought the coasts closer than today . 
  the hansa trade empire is a good example . 
  that applies to a normal person . 
  a professional alcoholic can have lots of practice . 
  for example , a truck driver was stopped by finnish police with a bac of 6.7 \u2030 - [ the test was double-checked ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000286955.html ) . 
  having done some data mining , that sounds like a noble idea that is , to put it mildly , * extremely * difficult to implement so that you get meaningful results . 
  if we have actual feeds from millions of secret microphones around the country , and that 's going to give you an accurate idea of the political future , we 're not talking about supercomputers , we 're talking about scifi-level ai that has n't been invented yet . 
  instead , i see here the bizarre fascination the soviets had with cybernetics , or automatic control . 
  i see your point , but 99 % of the problems with energy today are because energy is so cheap . 
  it is an extremely thin profit margin you have to accept . 
  the idea that there 's no solution to nuclear waste , and that * there ca n't be * , is disingenous . 
  we have technology to place it 1/2 + km underground , it 's not going to anybody 's back yard from there . 
  likely , we 'll dig it up back again and reprocess it in somewhere not very far future . 
   something that usually gets answered in a radical manner . 
  like getting deported after failing to obey the law ? 
  it 's not like we have to tolerate these people . 
  seriously , of the muslim friends i have , none of them insist on idiotic stuff like this . 
  those that do deserve all bits of `` intervention '' they are subject to , so to speak . 
  call me racist all you want , but i do n't have any more sympathies to the ( lily-white ) pedophiles in the laestadian ( christian ) conservative movement either . 
  justifying violence with religion gets exactly what is ordered , albeit in the opposite direction . 
  there have always been extremist cult movements , and all of them were essentially covers for systematic violence . 
  eventually , they met their end because you ca n't continue doing illegal stuff forever in a civilized country . 
  if you know finnish ( haha ) , i recommend the series * pime\u00e4n puolella * ( `` on the dark side '' ) , which features many christian extremist cults . 
  most of the problems in developing new energy sources are because of the extreme cheapness of oil . 
  it 's like you try to sell cakes and the next cake stand has a ( finite ) pile of cakes that are doled out nearly for free . 
  once cheap oil runs out , the spectrum of energy sources must , and will diversify . 
  sounds like sensationalizing . 
  rule # 1 of interpreting numbers used in political contexts is that they 're very likely bullshit , because they 're spun to support a certain argument . 
  radioactive waste is usually classified into low-level , medium-level and high-level waste . 
  low-active waste is stuff like people 's shoe protectors they use visiting the power plant . 
  90 % of radioactive waste is low-level waste . 
  it 's stored for 100 years and that 's it . 
  the global cumulative high-level waste inventory originating from the nuclear fuel cycle - all high-level nuclear waste ever generated - has [ a volume of 34,000 m ^ 3 ] ( http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/te_1591_web.pdf# ) , which would fit in 13 [ olympic swimming pools ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/swimmingpool.jpg ) . 
  that 's not a small amount , but not really beyond a technical solution either . 
  and it 's not a choice ; a technical solution must be found , stopping nuclear now wo n't make the existing waste disappear . 
  merkel might be a quantum chemist , but that does n't qualify you as an engineer or nuclear physicist ; but apparently , it qualifies you to be an opportunist :p . 
  let 's just say that you had me laughing like an idiot for 10 minutes straight . 
  best part , i understood [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/4ocq1abfs_q?t=104 ) . 
  the other way around , finns are the most genetically diverse people you have in europe . 
  the genetic distance between kuusamo ( northeast ) and southwest finland is the same as the distance between russia and italy , or latvia and france . 
  look at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_genetic_structure_\\ ( based_on_snps \\ ) _ pc_analysis . png ) . 
  well not really , the sami are even more of an outlier than the finns . 
  there 's an old folk story in lapland , that the old reindeer-herders and other wilderness-rangers do n't die and go to heaven , they turn into reindeer . 
  ( this story was retold by the famous n\u00e4tti-jussi and put into print by kalle p\u00e4\u00e4talo in * [ viimeinen savotta ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/viimeinen_savotta_\\ ( kirja \\ ) ) * ) . 
  not really , finns are best understood [ as a subgroup of the european population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_genetic_structure_\\ ( based_on_snps \\ ) _ pc_analysis . png ) . 
  besides , in biology , this sort of thing is completely normal . 
  consider the lizards and the mammals . 
  you have a neat group like mammals , and you can fit all into one group . 
  except , that it does n't quite work , some of them have a placenta and some are marsupials . 
  fine , let 's have an odd offshoot , it 's still mammals with funny marsupials to the side , and the world is in order and nothing 's strange . 
  and then there 's the platypus . 
  the platypus . 
  a thing with lizard legs , a bird 's beak , the hair and warm-bloodedness of a mammal and which lays eggs from a cloaca like a bird . 
  bye bye your neat classification . 
  inflation of author lists is completely normal . 
  it 's actually even a good thing , because it shows extensive expertise was consulted , it 's not just someone 's mom 's basement project . 
  this is historically accurate , since it 's known from e.g. 
  linguistic evidence that the southwest was largely settled by what we 'd identify as estonians today ( modern national-ethnic finns and estonians did n't exist then ) . 
  pretty much .
