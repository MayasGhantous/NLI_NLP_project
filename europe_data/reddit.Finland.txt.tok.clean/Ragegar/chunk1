nope , just little too fast and looks weird . 
  what did you do to upset th\u00f3r ? 
  registeration wall, 
  only for customers of a single isp , hardly national crisis . 
  there is a bit more into democracy that just voting the president . 
  there is no chill on video games , its serious business !, 
  turku / finland . 
  every politician would be evenly annoyed to travel there giving a balanced position for everyone to discuss . 
  possibly . 
  no , it was about you spotting a jewish or two who are doing well and making assumption that every jew anywhere is doing awesome and must be doing it by cheating the system and stealing from you . 
   some might simply be that they were held apart , but then , nobody really cares about the amish in the us . 
  not comparable in any way tbh . 
  jews did not build a small community somewhere to be unseen . 
  they lived in the cities or suburbs with small areas with jewish majority . 
  during times like depression it can be small things that can grow to big feelings of hatred . 
  maybe you and many of your friends lose your jobs . 
  you look at the jewish suburb and see the front of their houses and think `` they seem to be doing well '' even if they are in same position as you are . 
  then some jewish business owner extends his business and after a while business of your friend 's goes under . 
  you start to wonder how could the jew extend his business when your friend barely brought bread to table and then went under , did the bank give him a loan , why would they refuse your friend ? 
  then you realize that the head of the local bank is a jewish himself , he must have given the other jew an undertable deal !, 
  then from there even though you have no proof of anything you just start blaming the jews for your misfortune , when you have no proof of anything and the jews themselves are in same position as everyone else , losing jobs and business . 
  as i was reading i was wondering if its really that big of a problem , harrasment in 76 % of countries , that sounds really bad and worrying . 
  and then comes the part about norway with their cartoon and good part of the credibility of the article just vanished . 
  what the hell are you on about ? 
  huge part of both ea and activision game development happens in europe , they just own the companies that do the development for them . 
  europe is huge on video game industry , just that the big owners with money and interest happened to be in us early on so ownership has gathered there as they buy any and all development companies they can sink their teeth in . 
  people should realize that nachtingall was indeed not an ss batallion . 
  they fought against soviet union under nazi germany , but were not ss . 
   robert kagan predicted the russians would be involved in a conflict in ukraine , specifically citing crimea back in 2009 . 
  tbh , while people say that what happened was complete suprise , it was n't really a ** complete ** suprise . 
  it was well known by many that there is a possible conflict in the future over crimea . 
  just that like with many things , while you know that `` one of these years '' , methods used or speed of events still suprise you . 
  eurovision has been always about politics and agendas . 
  quite rarely are there any sort of exeptional music experiences to be had from there . 
  only problem here is that their performance did n't suck and it was pretty much only one that was interesting or had any sort of message and content . 
  rest of them were just generic shit . 
  even if you hated it , majority of finland did n't , and that was the point of this contest . 
  i must say all the tears you folk shead over this have been so so tasty . 
  i like how you made up a complete lie in your headline . 
  where exactly is the officer blamed for anything ? 
  according to the article , it is completely normal that a investigation is started if officer discharges their weapon and they are moved to another district until the investigation is over . 
  you are going to have to try harder if you want to make up shit . 
  you call 123 years a temporary occupation ? 
  poland did not exist as a sovereign nation before or during world war 1 . 
  sweden , [ could you not ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pwdridg.jpg ) . 
  you meant fortunately . 
  / r/europe needs to reflect the indecisiveness of actual europe . 
  ye , was aware of this , was just wondering if you meant something different . 
  does n't answer the question . 
  break how , as in what needs to be broken . 
  brute force , on what ? 
  by break what do you mean ? 
  all the while sweden makes crossing border to finland by train easier for paperless people . 
  yeah , well . 
  `` do you want this new law that would require you to buy new expensive automobile in the future ? '', 
  what a suprise nobody liked the idea . 
  the law change had short term annoyances and people usually just look at those and go * nope * . 
  you monster . 
  budgets for welfare systems come from somewhere and are finite , so some welfare programs can take a hit . 
  i have no idea what the situation is in germany , but in finland some unemployment programs have run out of their yearly budget already . 
  oh that , pff , they just do n't know better . 
  what outrage ? 
  when russians do that shit everyone but tabloits are `` meh '' . 
  i think its hilarious how you take superior position against all other cultures of the world . 
  and after we pass `` few million '' ? 
   it seems my opinion is not shared here , hatred !, 
  well , its the * final solution * if you catch my drift . 
  did you honestly think i suggested that is the first thing they should try ? 
  coming to europe is so risk free and easy right now that there is very little reason to not try to come over , whatever we do its going to have to be something that makes coming over illegally not worth trying , which again has to be something quite nasty , because people wo n't stop coming if you just say `` you are so naughty '' as they cross the border . 
  [ hahahaha , not funny ] ( http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ll5iu47xoq1qc08ab.gif ), 
  [ i 've seen this guy somewhere ] ( http://www.hcl.hr/images/recenzije/super-mario-bros-film/super-mario-bros-5.jpg ), 
   the problem is that italy and greece send all their migrants and refugees north . 
  the volume were gettign its not italys and greeces problem , either we start paying attention and do something about it or they let them trough as they fucking should at this point as this shit is ridiculous . 
  oh yeah , tell me more . 
  i 've talked to quite a few immigrants , how did you think that will change my mind ? 
  i do n't have problem with immigrants , i have problem with the incredible volume we have them coming right now . 
  grow up , its not first grade anymore where all adults tell you world is full of sunshine and unicorns . 
  very good argument there mate , you changed my mind totally . 
  now i am no longer at all concerned about sudden spike in uneducated population without ability to speak local language . 
  oh , so now i am extremist when i warn that its going to happen unless we actually take action about this ? 
  honestly mate , did you plan on housing the +3 billion people of the world living in extreme poverty and danger into europe ? 
  cause that is what you have to do unless you find ways to stop this . 
  yeah , excuse me that i am somewhat worried about group of people that is +10 % of my cultures population from foreign culture with foreing ideas of living moving around . 
  they should have been stopped before they got into area where schengen is in effect , that is the point . 
  if it fails at the edge , why the fuck keep it in the middle . 
  they show that we are not responding to crisises . 
  this shit is getting ridiculous and as the unpleasant decision were not made , were at point were making these decisions is getting harder and harder . 
  honestly , as much as i want to do good , at somepoint you have to be selfish and do the terrible act for our own and common good . 
  we shall see at what point we start sinking the boats because nothing was done to make coming over so easy/pleasant .

  [ 4-1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8tvtxknhae ), 
  you know considering there are grenades exploding every couple weeks , i wonder how small the chance is that some small suburb actually goes batshit insane and arms itself if sd gets into power and starts cracking down on that bullshit . 
  i do n't think it would be completely impossible idea that some suburb barricades the roads and shoots any and all officials in the area , how would sweden respond ? 
  go in with the military or just wait and hope the silly people stop doing what they are doing .

  you 're not supposed to tell them . 
  hey !, 
  nazis do n't have ownership of everything awesome . 
  stop it .
