also an alley of though worth exploring . 
  that they 've just become more organised and more careful . 
  or maybe they 've just got better at not getting caught ? 
  the issue is that spain has artificially created huge queues just to make it complicated as hell . 
  i wish the uk did that to spanish passport holders entering the uk while the other eu citizens just walk through quickly showing their passport . 
   i do n't ** have ** jews i 've never even met one !, 
  i just do n't like the government of israel oh i see you 're so kind not to have your own jew in a cage . 
  well that 's nice of you . 
   i just do n't like the government of israel so you think that it 's evil or what ? 
  you seriously asking this question ? 
   `` negro party '' . 
  now that 's one party with a theme ... wonder what the discussion was that lead up to this . 
  jesus you are completely nuts . 
  why else would they make it such a living hell for people to get in and out from gibraltar , people who are mainly spaniards working in gibraltar as your government fucked up the economy of spain so badly that they 'd otherwise sit at home starving . 
  a whole ** 98 % ** voted to stay british as late as in 2002 !, 
  these nuts saying that britain should give up gibraltar to spain are anti democratic hillbillies . 
  really ? 
   in a referendum held in 2002 , gibraltarians rejected by an overwhelming majority ( ** 98 % ** ) a proposal of shared sovereignty on which spain and britain were said to have reached `` broad agreement '' . 
  the british government has committed itself to respecting the gibraltarians ' wishes . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar yeah , 98 % sure is the same as :  the people in gibraltar do n't even given a fuck about spain or the uk . 
  haha talk about not knowing what you talk about . 
  not if the people of the territory want to stay british or french . 
  why would you do that ? 
  go against the people ? 
  spain just took what is the basque country and catalonia . 
  with the reasoning given here by the spaniard , that britain just took gibraltar and needs to give it back , the spanish government needs to give independence to the basque country and catalonia right away . 
  but guess if that 's going to happen . 
  the uk very much has all reasons to not cede gibraltar . 
  britain in modern times has shown that it is willing to allow people to decide their own faith , as with scotland and their referendum . 
  if the people of gibraltar have decided that they wish to stay british then spain has nothing to complain about . 
  sweden is the muslim extremists paradise . 
  not many countries that have as many people going to fight `` holy '' wars in the middle east as sweden has . 
  yet they 're allowed to come and go as they please while living of the swedish taxpayer . 
   that 's not the same thing at all and that 's a huge strawman argument . 
  it 's as ridiculous as you saying that it 's a bad argument as the british government represents the people . 
  so you 're an anti-semite as well . 
  there 's so many of you . 
  well that 's like saying that no irish person knows how to handle money . 
  your government represents you so all of you suck at managing spending . 
  ah so now it 's wrong to accuse someone from being an anti-semite when it goes against your beliefs . 
  but for you lot its ok to say that people are racist , xenophobic etc. 
  whenever it suits you . 
  you 're an anti-semite as well . 
  the politicians whore , hunt and do all kinds of shit with your money as well . 
  look at the expenses of meps . 
  it 's no damn difference . 
  corrupt politicians to investigate corrupt corporations . 
  i ca n't see this go wrong . 
  reading books , getting paid , retire at 55 and not do anything sounds like an awesome job though . 
  spain does n't like to let spaniards work in gibraltar they want everyone to be miserable . 
  thanks . 
  one would think that they would follow it closely as it is a small region that the spanish want to forcefully get their hands on . 
  do n't understand how people honestly think it will be any better with a president . 
  it wo n't . 
  i 'd rather have a monarch that a president owned by corporations who has executive powers . 
  ah thanks for the info . 
  did n't the newly elected president say something about taking back crimea ? 
  how does he aim to do that ? 
  only anti-semites will oppose our support for israel . 
  you hate jews because they are n't cuddly with your beloved middle eastern countries . 
  because it 's purchased with public funds ? 
  dublin is full of empty office space . 
  or just go out to sandyford or any other business park and there 's even more . 
  whole buildings just empty . 
  dublin 1 , 2 and 4 are mainly old georgian houses but even there , in around grand canal square where facebook is located there 's a lot of space free . 
  if not for some magic reason it all got occupants in the last two months which i doubt . 
  this is as obvious as saying that you will burn your finger on a hot stove . 
  like an illegal immigrant ? 
  we should support israel as the only nation that does n't bow down to the islamist extremists . 
  but i guess all the anti-semites here will be of a different opinion . 
  where does he get the funding to do this from ? 
  many here would like to throw all the right wingers in jail as well . 
  but i do agree with you , no one should be put in prison for political opinions or for any opinion they have expressed . 
   turkey is not in europe . 
  well that i can agree on . 
  but no one should be thrown into jail for their political beliefs not even commies even if i can not understand people who believe in it . 
  who cares ? 
  yes . 
  because even if he did right or wrong he still made the world a better place . 
  well you are the dicks here . 
  gibraltar is n't yours and the people of gibraltar do n't want to be a part of spain so in all ways possible the spanish government is the dick here . 
  and you are what ? 
  a hippie-leftist basket case ? 
  dude you need to study up a bit . 
  does n't mean they need to cleanse anyone, 
  gustaf ii adolf . 
  oh yes i do . 
  does n't make it any less of a quasi leftist project . 
  nah i stand behind my opinions . 
  no need to have another account . 
  find it funny when someone comes along and tries to make me sound fanatic . 
  i 'm not fanatic but i 'm conservative and that makes some here thing i 'm fanatic . 
  good . 
  do they need a helping hand ? 
  in the ocean . 
  i live 3 mins from the beach . 
  or then the lake at my summerhouse . 
  anyone from ukraine that can answer why the ukrainian government has n't sent the army to retake crimea ? 
  obviously there are risks but is this the only reason or are there other reasons ? 
  tell that to all the leftist nuts supporting the eu .
