  i myself am not very fond of this current economic model . 
  but as long as we 're doing things this way government spending will generate growth . 
  if it is sustainable is a different question . 
  belongs ? 
  wtf kind of attitude is that . 
  maybe her past has come back to screw with her mind : http://imgur.com/hepjlbk, 
  but you see , it 's still escapes me why you had to make religion a part of this discussion . 
  you feel inferior or something ? 
  is that the only thing you can hide behind ? 
  that is the big question here . 
  oh yeah ... that 's one source to take seriously . 
  the commies have never , ever been wrong before . 
  this story was brought to you by monsanto ... bringing gmos to a field near you . 
  ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ forget ^ ^ to ^ ^ ask ^ ^ us ^ ^ about ^ ^ our ^ ^ assortment ^ ^ of ^ ^ agent ^ ^ orange .

   agreeing with a typical muslim ? 
  why did you bring religion into this ? 
  you racist bastard . 
   of course you do n't agree with me thus consider my arguments flawed well let me tell you a secret . 
  considering someones arguments flawed is linked with not agreeing with them . 
  what do you expect . 
  people to agree with your flawed arguments ? 
  haha :d that 's almost like a scene from a comedy . 
  now this is the reason i said what i said in my criticised comment about shooting at the boats . 
  if we do n't deter them from trying more people will die . 
  but all these hippies are too self centred to understand that sometimes the most humane thing hurts a bit . 
   downvote then tells me to fuck off to asia you deserved it . 
  because your arguments are and were flawed as usual . 
  fucking hippies do n't they have better things to do . 
  like look for jobs ? 
  nuclear . 
  now remind me of what the eu should be focusing on . 
   you are downvoting a fact . 
  nothing new under the sun . 
  just the way it is around here . 
  this is the number one reason the eu parliament is n't a parliament and hence undemocratic . 
  ah ... national interests . 
  the think eu was n't all about . 
  well here we go . 
  putin is going crazy at a very fast phase . 
  now it 's going to be interesting to follow who does what in the coming years . 
  i 'm fairly sure that putin wants the old ussr back in some form or another . 
  seriously if the western governments would have wanted they could have removed him from power in the 90s . 
  hippies, 
  precisely . 
  precisely  but at least they seem to admit the problems : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceg6nqkhd70, 
   magdalene laundries i was amazed when i heard about these the first time . 
  i mean terrible and the fact that this was done in the name of `` god '' just makes me furious . 
  my girlfriend is irish and one of her relatives ( do n't want to go into details as it 's non of my business to tell ) had a really bad experience as a child from people of the church that should have been there to protect them . 
  i mean how many countless innocent children have suffered in the hands of the church and they can not even bring themselves to properly investigate , admit their wrong doing and apologise . 
  not all people in the church are bad , but as long as the catholic church does not take proper measures in dealing with its past and the rot within its organisation i just can not take them seriously . 
  they as an organisation bring shame to everyone that wants to practice their religion in peace . 
  i 'm not religious myself but i respect people who find happiness in it . 
  so for me its not a question of being against religion but it 's about justice . 
   google caches a lot of information even if it is removed from websites . 
  ah , very true . 
  did n't even think about that . 
  thanks for pointing it out . 
  i knew it but did n't even cross my mind . 
  no i do n't think we should work more , but definitely not less . 
  and work efficiency is very important . 
  i think in northern europe we work shorter days but we work during those hours more efficiently . 
  we really ca n't if we 're to be part of the global economy . 
  if you want to do that , then we 'd need to increase regulation and tariffs on imports from outside the eu . 
   the ecb insists it sees no threat of deflation really . 
  well i 'd bet the opposite to be honest . 
  the problem is that the ecb , fed , bank of england and hell almost every central bank let the markets go bananas with artificially low interest rates for years . 
  now they ca n't go any lower . 
  had the central bankers increased interest rates to match the economic boom and let it cool off like we 've done before in history a disaster like this could have been avoided and they 'd actually be able to significantly stimulate growth by lowering interest rates . 
  it 's time for europe to walk its own path and not follow the us path of destruction . 
  we need more regulation and not less regulation of the financial markets . 
  no more bailouts of any private entity , ever . 
  the whole sub prime scam was built through little or no regulation what so ever . 
  if countries were even half as good at regulating the casino that are the international financial institutions as they are at banning normal ambling and hunting down smokers with pitchforks we 'd be much better off . 
  the whole ecb is a temple of morons not to forget the fed who is like the god of gods when it comest to greed . 
  just imagine the nightmare google as a company is faced with after this ruling . 
  my first reaction to this was `` good '' . 
  but once i think about it more , it just feels so wrong . 
  sure , we have the right to be forgotten but that should not be the job of google but for the site hosting the information . 
  in a way google can be seen as the good guy here , brining forth what is out there regarding to your person . 
  if it 's not on google it wo n't be found and you 'd never know if it is there or not . 
  if i 's find some information on me via google that i do n't want up anymore i 'd contact the host of the information and not the search engine . 
  once you hear and read what has happened in those so called orphanages in ireland that were ran by the church you 'd not be surprised if these deaths were n't caused by them in some form or another . 
  i 'm not saying that it is the case , merely pointing out that this has something very dark hidden in it and time will tell if that is true or not . 
   so let 's not bash every priest or every catholic did n't do such a thing . 
  just pointed out that its no wonder people are n't particularly fond of the catholic church in ireland . 
  i mean i used to live there , and the sentiment is quite out in the open among a big chunk of the irish society . 
  the church shot itself in the foot for decades and now it is paying a very heavy price for it . 
  what bugs me is that they are so poor at admitting their fault . 
  this comes to mind on how bad they are in admitting their fault : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jhqndf9kx4&amp;app=desktop, 
   for me , in belgium , i have n't heard of anyone who would be against giving resonsibilities to the eu , if the results are better than when it would be handeled nationally not to sound like a dick but that ca n't be a hard thing to succeed with . 
  how the belgian government has ever managed to work is beyond my understanding . 
  well nothing new under the sun then , 
  thank god ... , 
  lol just to remind everyone . 
  we 're talking about the party that did [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6418456/labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-uk-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html ) . 
  who 's ever going to take them seriously ever again on this issue . 
  fascist ? 
  looks like a ukrainian woman pissing off pro-russian demonstrators .
