  at the completion of the service , the conscripts receive a reserve military rank of private , lance corporal , corporal , sergeant or second lieutenant depending on their training and accomplishments . 
   lol . 
  it 's 2014 that 's what the ones usually say when they end up wondering what just happened . 
  minimum is 6 months but depending on what `` training '' etc. 
  your assigned to or get into it 's longer . 
  special troops such as paratroopers have longer service as do the ones that are taken out to `` officer school '' . 
  do n't know all the terms in english to be honest . 
  so a little hard to explain . 
  but something like that  there 's been a debate , but most people support the system as it is . 
  mostly left leaning youngsters or \u00fcber liberals that have issues with it . 
  i am a supporter of it . 
  sure i was n't happy when i had to go but once you 're in it becomes what you make of it . 
  i 'd not change that experience for anything . 
  russia is n't really seen as a threat but something we need to be ready for . 
  it 's like a bipolar neighbour , you never know what they 'll do . 
   our military service is still in place but it is suspended for the time being . 
  with russia behaving as it does , soon you 'll all be called back in to do your service . 
  slackers gon na hate it :d, 
  yes . 
  it was great . 
  no but seriously it was n't all fun , but it is what you make it to be . 
  i had a lot of fun and a lot of memories that i 'd never get anywhere else . 
  where else would you live that closely with so many different people from different backgrounds and do so much weird shit for that long ( a year for me ) . 
  it also weeds away the whiner from people and they learn to not just do what the fuck they want all the time , and that their actions have consequences for others . 
  most people hate the fact that they have to do it before they 've done it . 
  very few people i meet that actually hate it once they 've done it . 
  then you have a few of these ( many on reddit ) pacifist that will complain . 
   just because someone opposed your idea of shooting at refugees does n't mean they support massive muslim immigration . 
  oh yeah almost forgot about that brilliant idea . 
  i do n't own a tv . 
  so who will decide what to produce ? 
  how much are we to produce of what and at what cost ? 
  what substitute products are we to have ? 
  where does the revenue go ? 
  who makes the decision how to invest the revenue ? 
  who organises the allocation and investment of the revenue ? 
  how well has that worked before ? 
  well they should not have gone there in the first place . 
  should they now ? 
  greece might be bonkers but i sure like their style from time to time . 
   ... indefinite detention until repatriation . 
  now there 's a project the eu should help to fund . 
  so social equality can only be gained through the far left ? 
  what about right to property etc ? 
  not good things ? 
  yep . 
  i 've has that particular discussion on reddit a few times . 
  what really get 's them going is when you say that stalin killed more people than hitler and god then they go all out crazy and few comments down the road someone come along and calls you a nazi . 
  works like a charm , never fails , 
  did i say they bring anything good to the table ? 
  what i asked was what possible good the left brings to the table as / u/superspacesloth seems to think it is good . 
  i was going to ask you the exact same question . 
  what possible good can the left bring to the table ? 
  you serious ? 
  well link to that reply then . 
  shhhhhh you ca n't say that in / r/europe . 
  i 've tried soon there will be an angry mob of commies hating you here . 
  indeed , it never fails . 
  yet i find it funny how many people seem to defend massive muslim immigration to europe from mena . 
   `` mr mehdi nemmouche , a french national who is believed to be from the northern town of roubaix , is also suspected of having been with islamists militants in syria last year . '', 
  anyone surprised ? 
  now where are you all that went on blaming the right wing for this ? 
   other europeans mostly seem to want the eu to either be a federalised superpower or at least a much more politically united confederation . 
  the feeling i get is that it 's more continental europe that wants this . 
  i think both uk and the nordic countries ( except denmark ) who have n't been geographically tied to the continent do n't find the same sentiment towards this `` common '' europe . 
   ( because his points are all really shit ) see here well that is so informative of you . 
  just reference to a whole discussion while making a sweeping statement that someones points are shit . 
  congratulations you 've finally outdone yourself . 
   i used `` finds '' , not `` shows '' . 
  my apologies . 
   but that could apply to all studies in economics where mathematic modelling is involved because the modelling makes unreasonable assumptions . 
  yes and no . 
  depends on the research question . 
  sometimes a quantitative study is the best option . 
  but when it comes to whether or not sovereign debt is harmful for economic growth or not a quantitative study on its own is not sufficient . 
  i 'd also argue that the research question sounds a bit too broad to be answered by a quantitative or a qualitative study . 
  but to be honest i did not look at the limitations they set for their study . 
   if an entire field is not as much of a hard science as most people assume , maybe it is right to always title claims made within that field in a weaker way in order to not mislead anyone into thinking it 's an open and shut case exactly . 
  i object the tendency from especial media , politicians and laymen to make simplified statements based on very narrow research findings . 
  but this also is a broader debate within economic research and ironically almost takes us back to the age old debate of keynesian and austrian economics . 
  now note that i 'm not taking any side there , merely pointing out that this debate on how economy should be studied or explained is an age old debate . 
  i am myself a strong believer in that economic phenomenon are very much need to be analysed through both quantitative as well as qualitative studies in a much broader sense then it is done today . 
  economics is a weird science and why there is n't more cross science research done combining the fields of economics , sociology and psychology is beyond me . 
  i mean they all can bring in much to explain many economic phenomenon . 
   i do n't see you applying the same standards you 're applying to me to almost every single submission like this . 
  it 's mainly because most submissions are n't related to science . 
  yes it 's included in the price . 
  which i think is fair as that is what you end up paying at the cashier . 
   but like in all science , just because a study has some limitations does not mean that the results are not what they are . 
  i never said that . 
  i said that your claim that this study ** quote ** `` study finds that sovereign debt is not harmful for growth '' is wrong . 
  if you 'd said `` study ** suggests ** that sovereign debt ** may not be ** harmful for growth '' i would agree . 
  you claim to be so well informed on academic research and yet you fail utterly in the claim you make . 
  as there is an enormous difference between stating that it ** shows ** or ** suggests ** . 
   but you 're being needlessly pedantic about the title because i guess you do n't like the conclusion . 
  no i 'm just pointing out that your title is miss leading . 
  i also question the applicability of these results in explaining an economic phenomenon which is a broader discussion on how economics should be studied and which by the way also is an ongoing debate within the study of economics . 
  i also do n't have anything against the conclusion of the study . 
  i only have issues with people taking a study and claiming it to state anything that it does n't prove . 
   you presented a qualitative story of how high debt interacts with growth .
