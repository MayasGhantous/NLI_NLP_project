  if you think my opinions are racist i believe that you are fully available to come to that conclusion yourself and it is your right to do so . 
  so you make up your mind and i 'll support whatever you decide to label me as . 
  that is what an open and honest society is all about . 
  it is almost like you believe that i am offended by you calling me a racist . 
  i 'm not . 
  i do n't care , honestly do n't . 
  thank you so much for taking the time to explain this . 
  i found an interesting short documentary on this after a little research yesterday that i found interesting : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laadbp9nytg, 
   and blacks have lower iq because of their genes , am i right ? 
  did i say that ? 
   they commit those crimes because of their genetic material , right ? 
  did i say that ? 
  seriously if you can not say anything but invent shit do n't say it at all . 
   and what would that `` human progress '' be ? 
  apartheid ? 
  concentrantion camps for those with the ` wrong ' genes ? 
  man you really have a dark and dangerous mind . 
  just pointing out that what you are saying is completely pointless as usual . 
  mumble without any coherent opinions except running around calling people racist . 
   ship houses ? 
  how would that work ? 
  you order it . 
  it 's done all over the place . 
  here 's a swedish company that does exactly that ( unfortunately only in swedish ) : http://www.alvsbyhus.se/ it 's shipped in elements and erected on site . 
  anyhow i do n't think you and we will find common ground . 
   i see . 
  i do n't even know why i bother . 
  nope , not a libertarian . 
  actually conservative but i think that either we have free trade without no government intervention in the eu or we do n't have it . 
  but do n't come calling it free movement of goods if there are limits upon limits to do this . 
  oh so i see we should be less acceptable as a society ? 
  great . . 
   we do n't have a functional single market because you go to great lengths to defraud your government of excise taxes ? 
  that 's a hilarious argument . 
  you serious ? 
  in a free market i should be allowed to order a house from spain and have it shipped to finland and pay the taxes to the country i buy the house from . 
  either you do n't understand the concept of a free market or you 're just trying to be stupid . 
  in a functioning free market within the eu i can order a truck full of alcohol from italy online and have it shipped to me at home and pay the taxes in italy as i made the purchase there . 
  if i buy a car in germany i shall pay the taxes for that purchase in germany and only pay a car tax calculated from the value i bought the car for in germany and not through some elaborate formula that uses say finnish prices to estimate how much i need to pay in `` taking in use '' taxes to be able to drive my car that i bought . 
  as long as we have a million and one exception or individual government agencies in each nation coming up with new ways to fuck us over we can not call it a ** functioning ** free market . 
  i sad : we do n't have a single ** functional ** market . 
  functional means that it is n't working as it should . 
  did i mention regulation as being the sole fault of the eu ? 
  no i did n't . 
   the eu ** banned ** snus in 1992 precisely my point . 
   alcohol ( obviously ) is n't limited it very much is limited . 
  for the sake of it , google how many cases have been in court in sweden and finland where the government has seized imports of alcohol which were ordered online from another eu state . 
   i 'm an accountant with a specialization in inter-european trade , and i wrote my thesis on exactly this topic . 
  well obviously you did n't do your homework . 
  if i am forced to personally go onboard a ship to tallinn and personally ** carry ** the alcohol i buy , and personally ** sit ** in the vehicle once it crosses the border to be able to not get my alcohol seized then we do not have a functioning single market no matter what you say . 
  new rules from the finnish customs as of this year ( translated google translate ) :  new instructions , the spirits importer will have to actually sit in the same car in which the spirits travels . 
   cusoms officials have put in force new guidelines that aim to limit import of alcohol from other eu countries , namely estonia ... http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288675175970.html you call that a functioning free market ? 
  well a lot of things are defined by race in this world . 
  such as some races being more likely to get illness a or b. 
  [ say blacks are twice as likely to get diabetes ] ( http://www.heart.org/heartorg/conditions/more/myheartandstrokenews/african-americans-and-heart-disease_ucm_444863_article.jsp ) , [ whites are more likely to have problems with their heart rythm ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131009162722.htm ) . 
  just two small examples that there are difference in us that we have to accept without just screaming racism as soon as someone points something out . 
  [ the finnish gypsies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_kale ) represent 0.2 % of the population and commit 18 % of the solved street crime . 
  these are just facts . 
  either you acknowledge that different groups of people have different traits or are more represented in some areas than other groups the quicker you can start calling yourself the antiracist . 
  because as long as you stick your head in the sand and refuse to accept differences you 're being ignorant and not willing to comprehend that if we understood more about each other the more likely we could get a long better . 
  people like you who always want to drag the discussion to oh you 're hitler are the ones that stand in the way of human progress . 
  like it or not , we are different and instead of pretending we 're all the same we should embrace that we are different and work from these differences rather than trying to lump everyone into one big fluffy group of people that are expected to live with each other without conflict . 
  biggest reason for conflicts is the fact that we do n't understand each other and people on some fictional moral high horse like you who think we are better of as a species not talking about it . 
  cars are regulated through taxes differing from state to state . 
  tobacco iss n't free look at the sale of snus which the eu has banned outside of sweden . 
  alcohol is limited so that you can not just order it as you like from any other eu state and the list goes on . 
  you go and research it . 
  oh there you are . 
  been wondering where the hippie that follows me is . 
  sorry forgot to pm you when i had something to say about gypsies . 
  so you 're saying the most acceptable society as we accept all forms of opinions . 
  sweet . 
  part of this ... well it 's just / r/europe . 
  does n't make much sense at times . 
  no i do n't hate them . 
  i just feel that they are a problem . 
  two very different thing . 
  taking into consideration that you are replying to yourself , in other word talking to yourself the question that begs to be asked is : did you take your meds ? 
  your reading comprehension is n't really good is it . 
  my mention of gypsies in this particular comment you 're replied to are a direct answer to a statement made by someone else . 
  he 's a communist in disguise . 
  he 's tax policies are enough proof of that . 
  in time it will become clear to you too . 
   the east has higher economic growth than the west . 
  well it 's not hard grow when you are at rock bottom . 
   you 're just hiding your shit prejudices and latent racism around `` the east '' . 
  nothing against the east . 
  but it was the death nail to the eu . 
   and remember that nokia was sent into irrelevance by a man with middle eastern heritage . 
  haha what ? 
  and what has this to do with anything . 
   soyuz ca n't fly now that would sting , 
  yes that 's the home of the brave  it ai n't home if it does n't smell piss in the stairwell .

   while others are hopelessly puttering about yelling racism or xenophobic at anything that moves while maintaining their blissful , naive neoliberal notion of a humanitarian , equal , fair , caring or whatever the fuck of europe . 
  where have you been hiding . 
  i could not have said it any better . 
  this sentence describes this subreddit in so many ways . 
  it 's rigged . 
  you ask questions that no matter what you answer it can be seen as either a or b.
