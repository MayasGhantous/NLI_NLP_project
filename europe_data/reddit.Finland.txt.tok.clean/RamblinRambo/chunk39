   gdp is n't everything . 
  it 's a good measure for if a nation should be in the eu or not . 
   your premise is that romania is shit because it 's poorer than western europe . 
  it is n't developed enough to be in the eu . 
   i suggest you come and visit and you might even like it . 
  very much think i 'd like it . 
  i do n't have anything against the country or the people . 
  just do n't think it is ready for the eu . 
  as i 've constantly said . 
  thanks . 
  what should i tag you as ? 
  any wishes ? 
  never said it was somalia . 
  said that it is underdeveloped compared to most other eu countries . 
  have to say you failed  i think it is funny as hell that you 're so easily provoked . 
  well good luck with that . 
  shall i pm you the next time i have something to say about muslims so that you can come and repeat yourself ? 
  as it seems to be a thing you like to do ... http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/264bgf/farright_fever_for_a_europe_tied_to_russia/chnt4f6 http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/264100/serious_what_is_the_best_part_of_your_job/chnj6ny http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chndk04 http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chnd13o http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chnbzm2 http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chnbyid you know you 're making a very good case of a leftist nut job . 
  honestly think it 's more about showing a big middle finger towards eu than actually wanting putin as some master . 
  seems you 've lost the capability to say anything else . 
  but yes , arabs should be stopped from coming to europe . 
  that i do n't know . 
  i do n't think it matters as for many people the multinationals are the issue . 
  also europe used to have a much stronger unions before , protected by trade barriers among other things . 
  they 've lost a lot of their power and especially the blue collar 's have fallen prey for the more international trade . 
  so for them they just want something to happen . 
  you would . 
  in a way i can . 
  now do n't misinterpreted this . 
  i 'm not a big fan of russia , hell i think i 'd be waking up to a lynch mob outside my window if i was . 
  anyhow , here 's my analysis . 
  russia has become a new big actor in the northern hemisphere . 
  for long it was just the us and then eu as it 's little lap dog . 
  russia balances this in good and bad . 
  the `` new totalitarianism '' i 'd say many people see as the banks and the financial sector , businesses and politicians in their pocket . 
  so this kind of semi-don ` t-bow-down-for-corporations-attitude putin is displaying is seen as something good among many people even if they do n't agree with russian policies on a broader base . 
  so some people grasp for this `` hope '' and `` idea '' that europe once again took a step back from globalisation and put more effort in securing their jobs and their welfare . 
   i have never understood how nationalists of different countries could ever get together being nationalistic does n't mean that you 're not for trade , diplomatic ties etc. 
  most people who vote for what some call the far-right are completely for free trade , free movement ( if you have a job ) etc. 
  they just want to keep the control of the country within the country and not transfer any powers to say brussels . 
  now this was beyond the scope of the article and i meant in general . 
  what come to the article i think that some of these parties just want to support anything that is against the eu and russia suits the bill . 
  is n't the eu just a beautiful thing . 
  itt : a lot of angry romanians , 
  so your saying the gdp numbers are wrong ? 
  because those are the only numbers i 've given . 
  interesting . 
  how full of shit are you ? 
  did you try to restart your compute ? 
  do n't you ruskies come poking around here or we 'll smack you silly . 
  speak for yourself :d, 
  true for finland and ireland as well , 
  it 's strong all over / r/europe . 
  i mean it is fascinating how things do get named and the stories and tales behind it . 
  sometimes when you drive to a place and you see a sign you wonder ... where did that name come from . 
  what used to be here ? 
  it wakes up the history buff in me . 
   it was a mess of a plan sounds like any plan by the un . 
  every day is a day to learn something new , 
  ok . what 's this annan plan deal ? 
  christ ... you just brought back my memories of writing my thesis . 
  i feel relieved that it 's over but at the same time it brought back all the memories of spss and late nights in a computer lab . 
  since then i have a genuine love hate relationship towards statistics . 
  do n't burst their bubble dude . 
  what is the general sentiment of reuniting cyprus among cypriotes ? 
  are there any polls done ? 
  unfortunately . 
  curious . 
  what is the reason behind the name montenegro ? 
  sorry if i sound stupid , but is there a significant mountain there named montenegro ( black mountain ) ? 
  or where does it originate from ? 
  edit : and yes , congratulations  edit 2 : found it . 
  for anyone interested : crna gora , sometimes transliterated as tsrna gora ( `` black mountain '' ) , is used to denote a larger part of montenegro in the 15th century . 
  it had in the late 14th century only referred to a small strip of land of the pastrovici , but eventually came to be used for a wider mountainous region after the crnojevi\u0107 family in upper zeta . 
  the aforementioned region became known as old montenegro ( \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / stara crna gora ) by the 19th century to distinguish it from the newly acquired territory of brda ( the highlands ) . 
  montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century as the result of wars against the ottomans , which saw the annexation of old herzegovina and parts of metohija and southern rashka . 
  the nation has changed little since that time , though it lost metohija and gained the bay of kotor . 
  the country 's name in most western european languages reflects an adaptation of the italian-venetian calque monte negro ( modern italian would be monte nero ) , meaning `` black mountain '' , which probably dates back to the era of venetian hegemony over the area in the middle ages . 
  other languages , particularly nearby ones , use their own direct translation of the term `` black mountain '' . 
  so now we can not trust gdp numbers anymore . 
  well we 're really living in interesting times . 
   only allah knows for certain . 
  i see . 
  well go ask him when you can marry a 9 yo . 
  what shit , they are fact based numbers . 
  are you denying the truth of them ? 
  yeah . 
  i do n't mind paying as long as i get what i want . 
  but i do n't want to pay for stuff i do not want . 
   you ca n't make a baby in one month by impregnating nine women lol that is very much true . 
  but i do believe that more available funding would lead to improved possibilities to run tests . 
  for an example make test facilities more widely available and the possibility to research a variety of different standing theories . 
  best thing would be to research a viable system transport geothermal power from iceland . 
  it 's basically an unlimited supply of power . 
  italy also has huge geothermal resources for energy production . 
  at this time italy only 1.5 % of its energy from geothermal sources and if i 'm not mistaken this could greatly be increased . 
  i 'd also like to know how much or little money is actually being spent on research of fusion power . 
  is there any government that is taking this research as a high priority . 
  the us could take the amount is spent on iraq in 12 months and invest it in this instead . 
  the eu could take all money generated from green taxes in one year in all member states and put it to use in research of fusion power .
