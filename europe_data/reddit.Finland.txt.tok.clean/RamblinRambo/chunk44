  you and i both know that it is n't rocket science to get a pass if you know the right people . 
  once you get dublin bus working we might think about it , 
  his medical reason was allergies for nettles . 
  i mean it 's a trumped up damn excuse and he could have joined the navy . 
  i can promise you there 's no nettles on the ships . 
  he weaselled himself out of his duty and now he represents that duty . 
  that is fucked up beyond any logic . 
  i did n't mind serving . 
  it is something expected of us and that 's it . 
  we have mandatory conscription in finland and that means we all are meant to do it . 
  if you have medical reasons , sure . 
  but do n't expect me to take you seriously as a defence minister when you could n't do your job because of allergies to nettles when there are many other options out there . 
  carl haglund is as fake as bad politicians come and his only interest is his personal gain . 
  nothing else but what is good for him matters . 
  well women do n't have mandatory service do they ? 
  for all i care they should as well . 
  but a man being a defence minister that did n't even have the character to do his share speaks lazy ass all the way . 
  both wallin and haglund are incompetent . 
  for those who do n't do military service they should n't be defence ministers . 
  show character and do your part of you intend to have such a position on society . 
  thanks for explaining   but people really like to divide things over here . 
  in a way understandable after such a mess as the breaking up of yugoslavia was . 
  carl haglund is popular in / r/europe anyone saying anything bad about him gets downvoted . 
  female is ok . 
  but a guy who did n't do military service is a no no . 
  the diplomacy is handled by the president , prime minister and foreign minister . 
  besides , his medical reasons we 're no medical reasons . 
  as someone with no clue about those languages . 
  are they very close to each other ? 
  ah you can understand finnish too . 
  - ** fluently ** : finnish , swedish and english - ** understand ** : danish , norwegian and estonian - ** basics ** : spanish , italian and russian a few sentences in irish  i wish i 'd learnt german when i was younger . 
  now there 's really no time to take up any language . 
  but i 'd love to know german . 
  one of these articles that are there to be used when one wants to do something that one should not do . 
  kind of like the patriot act in the us . 
  - sir . 
  why did you shove a cheeseburger up mrs flinkers ass ? 
  - because of national security . 
  as long as you leave your 5249 different councils and governments to belgium . 
  the pacifist here do n't get it . 
  but for us in a country where every man has to do military service a defence minister who cheated the system to get away with not doing it as a defence minister is a fucking joke . 
   you can not be a friend of russia . 
  you can obey russia , but dont count on russia to considerate you if you have trouble , on the contrary , count on them to backstab you . 
  but you can sell warships to them . 
  you know you ca n't be reluctant towards nato or the eu in / r/europe i do agree with you though . 
  calle haglund is n't much of a politician to take seriously . 
  he 'll change opinion to whatever seems on top of the agenda any given day . 
  he represents a minor party who will do anything to be important . 
  their party basically expects everyone like me who is a swedish speaking finn to vote for them . 
  that jackass has n't even done military service like 99.9 % of all men in finland and should not be the defence minister . 
  each time i see his stupid toy-boy face it honestly pisses me off . 
  then we 'll take the netherlands with us to a north european union and send pics of our assholes to brussels . 
   that sort of car tax is a bit much , i think . 
  all taxes are a bitch . 
  one thing people around the world can agree upon , 
   one of the most important centers in germany if one has to underline the importance of once work it probably is n't important . 
  the way you seem to want to validate yourself and what you do , and how hard you work seems to be a question of insecurity rather than people actually thinking your lazy . 
  anyhow this thread is n't about laziness but about euro scepticism . 
  having lived in the us . 
  what you save in cars and gas you spend on healthcare and shitty internet . 
  denmark is a small country in land mass , well developed public transport and short distances to anything . 
  also distance is important . 
  in especially finland , norway and sweden we have huge distances to anything up in the northern parts . 
  in the southern parts of both countries the distances are normal between cities etc. 
  but imagine , some parts of sodankyl\u00e4 up north in finland you 're 0.75 people per km2 . 
  worst case your a 30 minute drive from your nearest neighbour . 
  living without a car up there is just impossible in todays world . 
   for i am usually the last who leave the office . 
  having worked with a lot of spanish and other southern european people this just does n't say anything . 
  to be honest , for me , the one who stays in the office the latest is the slowest in doing their job . 
  even if it is n't true this coming in early and leaving late is very much a cultural thing . 
  i come in and leave exactly when my time to come in and leave is . 
  during that time i do all my work so that i have time to spend doing what i like and not just working . 
  i can with confidence say , from having worked with almost every nationality there is , that some cultures work slower than others . 
  in other countries you go in , do your stuff and go home . 
  in others there is more importance placed in `` being there '' even if you 're not doing anything . 
  in others it is important to stay late , very late or until your boss goes home ( japan is one of them ) . 
  so your point of being first in and last out really does n't tell anything . 
  it 's no secret that some cultures are n't very effective . 
  some work to much ( us ) and some do n't get anything done . 
   you are not really hearth and soul of eu i completely agree . 
  this is also one more reason why i do not , myself , see any reason for us to be in the eu . 
   you say it like we do n't waste time on democratic ways we just act . 
  never said that . 
  i said that we are pragmatic in general . 
  look at finnish foreign policy since the war , it has been very practical . 
  at many times a balancing act , but instead of getting too deep into a hole where we can not get out of we opted for the most logical solution . 
  the whole issue if finland wanted to be bailing out euro countries in need , was actually a very pragmatic discussion . 
  we had to think about the practical implications rather than just jump on the bandwagon to save the euro . 
  an example of lack of practical thinking is exactly what you say here :  well when communism fell it was ` promised to '' countries of eastern expansion '' that they would join eu . 
  if they were n't promised that i doubt communism would have failed or that they would distant themselves from russia . 
  it was a very emotionally based decision to just promise anything . 
  if the countries would have really wanted to progress they 'd opt out of communism anyhow . 
  so if there is/was a genuine want to move forward and into the future then no promises would have ever been needed . 
  nothing is perfect nowhere , but i argue that the nordics would be much better off without the eu . 
  it 's my opinion and i do n't expect everyone to agree with it . 
  india is something i 'd never want to become . 
  one language is the key there . 
  not as populous and less cultural and historical luggage . 
  having a passport with you is really a non issue .
