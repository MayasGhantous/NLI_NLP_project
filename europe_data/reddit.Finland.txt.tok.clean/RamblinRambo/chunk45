  except for some eastern countries there has been passport free travel among other european nations for a long time . 
  we in the nordics had passport free travel before the eu even existed . 
  exchange program 's have also existed long before the eu without tuition fees . 
  many of these benefits have existed long before the eu . 
  the countries that see the as benefits are in much countries that did n't have much going for them before the eu . 
  [ max martin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dhuugaxwk ), 
  oh yes , let us not discuss the issue . 
  stick our heads in the sand and pretend nothing happened . 
  that 's a sure way to success . 
   eu is and always will be western this is exactly it . 
  the nordics are western , but we 're also nordic . 
  we 've always been different . 
  especially finland with it 's insanely long border with russia . 
  we 've had to go at it from our own perspective . 
  we 're western but as big countries ( land mass ) with few people we 've simply not had time or energy to be involved in what many of us consider superficial politics . 
  good example is the whole brussels/strasbourg debate . 
  we traditionally do n't have time to mess about pointless things like this . 
  i mean the only reason this exists is french pride . 
  it is a simple example but still exemplifies the whole issue . 
  the continent is so full of old historical bs that just slows progress down . 
  then we have the east . 
  we can not be kidding ourselves and say that there is no difference between the east and the west . 
  there are major differences . 
  the east has a completely different set of issues ( mainly old ussr fallout ) than the west . 
  so even imagining some federation at this point will never work . 
  the leaders of such a federation would mainly come from the western parts of the union . 
  people with no understanding of eastern or nordic politics , society and issues . 
  i say , no wonder the whole idea of a federation does n't get much support up north and in some parts of the east . 
  we just can not see it working . 
  finally a tread that aims towards a deeper discussion . 
  here is my story . 
  i used to be pro-eu and there was a time i considered that a federation would even make sense . 
  the eastern expansion took all that away . 
  it was the move where eu lost a lot of internal support in many key states . 
  once that happens , even the smallest things will spur on the negative feelings . 
  beggars on the street is one thing that hits you in the face each morning you go to work . 
  now we are also more entangled with former ussr politics which is something that takes energy and focus away from the eu becoming stronger and more politically powerful on the international stage . 
  we have more corruption and eu funding is going to the pockets of leaders mainly in the east . 
  organised crime has woken up to the eu scam way of getting its hand on cash and the list goes on . 
  as i said in some previous thread . 
  sure we had issues with corruption and organised crime before the expansion , but that was limited mainly to greece and southern parts of italy . 
  it was manageable , now its out of control . 
  i do n't know what the truth is , but with the eastern expansion it feels like we also got more countries dependant on russian gas . 
  i might be wrong but anyhow . 
  what it has done , is that even if continental europe was dependant on russian gas before , now we have to balance a good relation with russia while having nations in the union that have tense relations to russia all while securing our energy supply . 
  i support free trade and cooperation within the union but it has evolved out of that . 
  i myself do n't see eu as it is today working longterm and i think it is time for us ( at least in the nordics ) to think of alternatives . 
  for us in the north we have everything to win from exiting the eu and going ahead with a nordic union . 
  we 'd be less bound by policies formed in brussels , our economies could develop much faster with regards to the key competences and the natural resources we have at our disposal . 
  we 'd also be able to develop our trading relations with russia and boost our economies . 
  we 're not dependent on russian gas or oil , we 'd be on a level playing field with them where trade and development would be of mutual interest rather than being involved in some post ussr political game . 
  russia is back as a key player in the world and it 's time we recognise this . 
  the eu expansion to the east took away our strategic advantages and made the union much more of a russian lap dog . 
  anyhow . 
  i 'm in a bit of a hurry , but wanted to comment before i forgot about this thread as it is an interesting question . 
  so if something is unclear i 'm more than happy to clarify  in conclusion i could say : no i 'm not against european cooperation . 
  i am agains the new eu . 
  i was supporting of the eu before the eastern expansion . 
  now we just need to find a new way to move forward and for me that means a separation from the eu for the nordic countries at least . 
  the other solution would be that the eu excluded some members which will never happen , so the only thing left to do , it to go at it on our own . 
  the key to much of the nordic success has always been that we 've been fast to adapt . 
  we 're very pragmatic countries , if we see an issue we adapt to it as quickly as possible instead of wasting time in a political debate , wishing for dreams to come through . 
  i feel that the eu has become a dream instead of being a viable option and that is why it is time to move on . 
  i honestly do n't see it working . 
  i do n't even want it to work anymore . 
  not even the mafia dares to touch putins cash . 
  yes , an emphasis on the ** pls ** . 
  about time we got science going again . 
  i 'm nordic and do n't wa n't to be in the eu so for all i care i 'm happy to not be european . 
  ajax , remember them back in the 90s with litmanen . 
  have n't watch many games since his day with ajax but anyhow  litmanen is a damn tank , that guy is old and he still plays . 
  i bet they 'll have to buy him a wheelchair soon to play in . 
  ** ice hockey ** : hifk ( helsingin ifk , finland ) , fr\u00f6lunda indians ( sweden ) , new jersey devils ( nhl ) ** football ** : ifk g\u00f6teborg ( sweden ) , arsenal ( england ) , football in finland suck so i do n't have a team here . 
  big part of my life i lived in gothenburg so that 's why i 've got the swedish teams as well . 
  new jersey devils also from living in nj . 
  good thing was that i was a devils fan already before moving to nj . 
  as i used to live in ireland i of course need to have a gaa team : ** gaa ** : dublin of course  gaa is one weird circus , especially the hurling guys are damn near insane all of them . 
  how there 's not ten dead players after each game is beyond my understanding . 
  really exiting sport . 
  coolest thing about the gaa is that the players do n't get paid much at all , so it 's about the sport and not about the money which has ruined quite many sports . 
  so it is , but that cost of administration could be cut by a few hundred ( estimated 200 ) million if we just stopped going to strasbourg all the damn time . 
  i am fairly certain the 200 million would do much more good at esa than in having people commute between two places for no actual reason except french pride . 
  true believe ? 
  wtf if that is the basis upon which we are to grade facts or fiction we 're doomed . 
  italian economy is n't the biggest issue in the euro zone and those saying it is , are wrong to some degree but also right . 
  the italian economy has n't performed as well as it did before the euro but it does n't make italy suck . 
  but having '' not true believers '' as an argument to dismiss claims made by someone is just wrong on so many levels . 
  regarding italian economy since the euro the bbc had a good article about it : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26266118, 
  now i do n't want a french heart !, 
  german brain yes , but french hear , oh no no . 
  ireland left the pigs in the dust  or at least the good ` ol republic is starting to get its engine going again . 
  slowly but surely . 
  i think it had more to do with the national debt in relation to gdp . 
  i myself do n't consider italy a weak economy . 
  it has regional issues , but northern italy definitely is n't in bad shape . 
  in a way i can understand i can understand some aspects of lega nord 's ideas . 
  now i 'm not at all knowledgeable in italian economics or politics , but i do n't think it takes a rocket scientist to understand that the north of italy would be much better of without the south . 
  this is why i think there are quite a few that support the idea . 
  i might be wrong but anyhow . 
  the south of italy is like a limp dick in a whore house and seems to stop italy from prospering as much as it could .
