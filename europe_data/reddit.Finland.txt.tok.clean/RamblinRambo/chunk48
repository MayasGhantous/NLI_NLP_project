  if we have money to send to corrupt governments we sure enough have money to spend on science . 
  [ now have you ever shot one of these ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-p6dys8q78 ) i do n't suggest that this would be the solution , but you get the point ... it 's not like it is unstoppable . 
  exactly . 
  well that is one hell of a blue eyed way to look at the world . 
  what user are you quoting and why are you quoting him/her/it / to me ? 
  for fuck 's sake ... you said :  to be honest , ** your ** direct implication that if you do n't shoot at rafts people will eventually kick you out of your bed and make you live in cardbox makes this question a bit hard to answer . 
  `` you do n't think we should shoot at immigrants ? 
  you must be one of those people who politely leave when somebody tries to expell them from their home . '', 
  you ca n't ask people to answer rhetorical questions when there 's such an obvious gap between two positions . 
  quoting someone else as if you were replying to me . 
  what is sad is that of all the shit the eu spends money on , they do n't even spend a billion on esa . 
  we could start with not moving the whole damn eu parliament between two cities and put that money into esa instead . 
  debate is good . 
  do n't understand why some people insist on thinking that a debate is bad . 
  or far-left lunatics . 
  it 's important to vote . 
  but this video is shit , with a opportunistic dick who loves the attention and is in it for the money made by ssu the most corrupt political youth organisation in sweden . 
  this h\u00f6ss , one day he wants to forget his past , the other day he is selling nazi stuff online , then he used to be in a neo-nazis organisation etc. 
  and now suddenly he 's a victim again . 
  give me a break . 
   what if someone non-threatening decided to live in your bedroom and they wo n't leave when asked kindly ? 
  who are you quoting ? 
   what , how are personal bedrooms and `` lives-somewhere-in-the-country-or-in-another-country-in-europe '' the same thing ? 
  it 's just not comparable . 
  who are you quoting ? 
   anyway , what should the police do then if they do n't listen to kind words ? 
  just go away ? 
  nice job ignoring my question . 
  who are you quoting ? 
  no it was n't they tried to make the point that if you do n't vote all hell will break loose . 
  in fact voting is no guarantee for any particular outcome . 
   but overall comparisons with 1930s germany are completely over the top . 
  precisely . 
  i mean this is just a little too much . 
  also , it 's from sweden where everything is considered racist or right wing , so instead of motivating at least me it just pisses me off . 
  and it is ssu who are notoriously moronic and corrupt . 
  they falsified documents and got almost 500 000 sek wrongfully paid to them by the swedish tax payer and they also wrongfully claimed 1.2 million sek at another incident . 
  so having them pretending to be on some moral high horse makes me sick . 
  never forget to vote . 
  well hate to break it too you , the nazis got elected into power . 
  scaremongering is what this is , nothing else . 
  coming from sweden it makes it even more disgusting as sweden is completely up the walls crazy when it comes to right-wing-scare . 
  i mean if you eat a cookie that is the wrong colour you 'll be called a right-wing extremist . 
  the guy in the video is also a damn opportunistic worm : http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4070115,00.html, 
  hah ... you really showed the ruskies this time . 
  who are you quoting ? 
   and once more you fail to see my point and try to twist it against me . 
  well either you can not write or you do n't know what your saying yourself . 
   how about we put in a comprehensive system that allows immigrants to find work and a home , same as any national . 
  sweden does that well , even if people claim ** it discriminates against swedish nationals ** . 
  tell me what that does mean if it does n't mean that you take jobs from others to give to immigrants . 
  furthermore i said , `` so if i understand you correctly . '', 
  that means that i asked you if i understood you correctly . 
  i mean just this part of your post shows that you 're completely lost and arguing with you is pointless . 
   oh , have you ? 
  why did n't you tell me this earlier ? 
  because you did n't ask . 
   name me the countries you lived in , then . 
  if you believe yourself superior to me in this way , put it on the table . 
  i never said i was superior i said i `` most likely have lived in countries than you '' . 
  most likely means that i am unsure . 
  you seem to lack skills in reading comprehension . 
  where i 've lived . 
  well if you need to know i suggest you go through some of my post in other threads , it is n't a secret . 
  i can give you a hint , it 's four countries . 
  what i 've done in these countries is to work and live and the rest of that is non of your damn business . 
  a conflict zone you say . 
  we can start with kosovo . 
  now you tell me where you 've been . 
  cos i 've got a few more on my list of conflicts where i 've seeing human suffering and learning that we can do more good there than here . 
  i guess i should not keep my hopes up as your most likely a pacifist computer warrior saving the world with no hand on experience from the ugly reality of our world . 
  edit : in fact do n't bother to answer , i do n't care . 
  there is no such thing as fairness in the broader perspective of the world . 
  we have limited resources and we 're simply too many to make it work . 
  the biggest source of terrorism in the world is the religion of islam and a religious conviction you can not take away from a person . 
  criminals will be criminals no matter where they are . 
  economically impossible to make the world equal . 
  for every million people removed from poverty a year a further five million is born into poverty a year . 
  human rights does not mean that we need to put our selves into poverty . 
  i ca n't vote in turkey so do n't worry . 
   how about we put in a comprehensive system that allows immigrants to find work and a home , same as any national . 
  sweden does that well , even if people claim it discriminates against swedish nationals . 
  helping them integrate is better than throwing them to the wolves , like you 'd advocate . 
  so if i understand you correctly . 
  it is better to ensure that the immigrants have jobs than the domestic people ? 
  this would mean that we make other loose their livelihood to the benefit of someone else from another country ? 
  how will you find work and a home to everyone coming into the eu illegally and how do you suggest we pay for this ? 
   aswell as the norwegians do , they must work to gain social welfare . 
  what work do you suggest we give them . 
  we got just hit by the news that 4 million in spain are without a job . 
  should we not try to find them jobs within the eu before giving it to others ? 
   you advocate shooting refugee rafts well if you shoot at them they 'll stop . 
  if they stop they 'll survive . 
  if they drive into the shots fired they decided to ... well kill themselves . 
  if someone shoots a warning shot , would you keep on heading towards the same direction or turn around ? 
   they go there , open up a cafe or so , but only to find the cultures there do n't have the same . 
  they end up stuck in a purgatory . 
  well then they can go back ca n't they . 
  just take ones two legs and start putting one in front of the other .
