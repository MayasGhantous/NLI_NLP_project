  what because they do n't like the turks ? 
   hey can not beat 13 million civilian deaths in 4 years . 
  do you realise how many millions were killed in gulags alone by stalin ? 
  and not to forget everyone else he had killed . 
  just look at this :  [ medevedev 's grim bookkeeping included the following tragic episodes : 1 million imprisoned or exiled between 1927 to 1929 ; 9 to 11 million peasants forced off their lands and another 2 to 3 million peasants arrested or exiled in the mass collectivization program ; 6 to 7 million killed by an artificial famine in 1932-1934 ; 1 million exiled from moscow and leningrad in 1935 ; 1 million executed during the '' great terror '' of 1937-1938 ; 4 to 6 million dispatched to forced labor camps ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 ), 
  it just shows that the danish have humour . 
  i love it and i respect the danish parliament for doing this . 
  it 's awesome !, 
  swedish media should just die . 
  this is why i love denmark !, 
  just think of the scandal if the us congress released this :d, 
  as i said :  but even if it changes to the worse it can change back to the better if we let opinions and beliefs be free . 
  so yes i am actually of the opinion that no opinion should be banned . 
  maybe i 'm weird like that but i genuinely believe in freedom of expression , speech , opinion or whatever we might call it .

  ~ ~ british ~ ~ irish food is bad . 
  for your heart . 
   gypsies , while only 3 ~ 5 % of our population is rroma it 's cos the other 25 % are begging on our streets  it 's a joke !, 
  summer in dublin goes like this . 
  when the irish kids write their leaving certs it 's sunny . 
  once they 're done it starts raining until the next time it is leaving cert time . 
  so when i heard kids talk about leaving certs coming up i 'd dig out my shorts , sunglasses and flipflops . 
  snails are good , really good when served in this garlic butter sauce . 
  hot damn i wa n't snails now . 
  they serve them in many restaurants in sweden and finland as well . 
  last time i had then was two weeks ago in stockholm . 
  frog actually is tasty . 
  i was surprised how tasty it was . 
  i 've seen frog on the menu bot not in france but in louisiana , us . 
  damn you just ruined my daydreams :(, 
  thanks for informing me . 
  i appreciate it . 
   see here 's the problem , because there is a lack of basic infrastructure , there are barely any schools . 
  no schools means lack of education . 
  lack of education means a lack of awareness amongst the population to know what needs to be done to turn the country into a thriving economy . 
  ca n't you see the fundamental issue here ? 
  actually i need to let you in on a secret , my second masters is in economic geography so these issues are n't exactly new to me . 
  this is why i am a little opposed to the whole idea of western intervention in africa and wanted to play a little of a devils advocate with you . 
  the lack of schools and infrastructure is actually more of a political issue than an purely economical one . 
  the issue comes from the fact that corruption is widely spread in the whole of africa . 
  money from natural resources and western aid has basically all the time gone down the pocket of the political leaders in africa and not to the improvement of their people . 
  in many cases we could argue that western monetary aid helps these corrupt officials to stay in power prolonging the development in africa . 
  the one big blame i open handedly am willing to place on the colonial powers is the division of africa . 
  what once were hundreds and thousands of different tribes and societies who had boarders and `` own '' areas of land became either divided by a line drawn with a ruler or lumped into a country with a hundred more cultures that were completely different . 
  as if we 'd take greece and lump in in with turkey and expect them to get along without issues . 
  this is still a huge issue and reason for conflicts in many african nations . 
  one thing that would be interesting is if the different countries in africa which are huge land masses were allowed to separate into smaller countries . 
  but that would go against the political elite in the respective countries and reduce their power . 
  something they are n't willing to do . 
   internal corruption caused , as i noted , by us trying to force political model and culture that is simply incompatible with the unique cultural landscape of africa . 
  the problem is that whatever the west does or does n't its always a problem . 
  the unique cultural `` landscape '' and `` trying to force political model and culture that is simply incompatible '' ? 
  should we say that go back to living in clay huts and rape children to cure yourself from aids as it 's part of your unique culture or try to guide them towards a sustainable society ? 
  unique cultural landscape ... well sure it 's unique but that can not be said to be the reason why they can not adapt to the rest of the world politically or do you suggest that they should have their own little way of doing things ? 
  the basic infrastructure can be erected by the people of africa deciding that they want to do so . 
  it will need social change and stopping the in fighting and not a single african nation can be said to have succeeded at it in long term no matter how much we leave them alone . 
  look at zimbabwe , it used to be the bread basket of africa and now its a corrupt hell hole and we can not blame anyone else for that than the people of zimbabwe themselves . 
  because if we are completely honest and look at history zimbabwe went to shit right after they were given the power to run themselves . 
  i understand what you are saying and i am being provocative just to illustrate a point that just blaming it on cultural uniqueness and the west is n't really a valid holistic argument . 
  and liberia , is a complete and utter hell on earth with cannibalism and their very own [ general butt naked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_butt_naked ) . 
  it 's economic development can not be seen as any success story either . 
  ethiopia i 'm not knowledgeable enough to say anything about . 
   the tyranny of a ( manipulated ? ), 
  majority has to be prevented at any price !, 
  who decides what is a manipulated majority ? 
  i mean this whole political correctness phase the world is going through could also be seen as a manipulated majority . 
  what i 'm getting at is , that it is hard to be objective and claim that one opinion is worse than another just because you yourself think so or the majority or minority thinks so . 
  times change , opinions change and what is the norm and acceptable also changes . 
  back in the day slavery was completely ok , so was pedophilia ( way back in the day ) , not to forget that it was completely ok that women were n't allowed to vote . 
  back then someone opposing this would have easily been called a manipulated majority . 
  fact is that most humans just align themselves to whatever is the most mainstream opinion . 
  i 'd bet my left ball that more than half of the people screaming racist on reddit today would call people liberal idiots 20 years from now if being against immigration or racial equality would become the norm . 
  the faster we accept that most people do n't really have an opinion the better , and then we can let the world take its course and hope for the best . 
  there is no such thing as a perfect world as even the opinion of what would be a perfect world changes from time to time . 
  this is why allowing all opinions to be free is important . 
  without it nothing would ever change for the better or the worse . 
  but even if it changes to the worse it can change back to the better if we let opinions and beliefs be free . 
   problem is you ca n't just fuck over an entire continent for over a century and then just say `` fuck it , not our problem . '', 
  of course you can . 
  just do it . 
   it has left them stripped for resources africa is still the most resource rich continent on the planet and the only thing holding them back the last 20 years has been their own internal corruption . 
  if we are to take care of africa which i do not think we should it should be the former colonial powers that do so and not the ones that were not involved in the first place . 
  it 's not misleading , its very much a fact . 
  finland as of 2013 only has 63 000 twitter accounts registered . 
  sweden has a larger population and still only has 475 000 users . 
  according to twittercensus.se and twittercensus.fi . 
  of the top ten twitter user countries three are from europe . 
  uk which represents 17 % of the users , france that represents 1.76 % of the users and ireland 0.85 % of the users . 
  more here : http://www.beevolve.com/twitter-statistics/, 
  it is . 
  how well it can be applied to politics is another issue , 
  this is what i mean , we can only speculate now . 
  allowing the regions to go on themselves for x amount of years would give a more reliable answer . 
  i 'm a strong supporter of letting africa develop by their own . 
  western money is just helping the status quo and nothing will change if we keep on going as we 've done until now . 
  this whole colonial hungover is however something that needs to be left behind . 
  it 's not doing anyone good if we live in the precent rather than for the future . 
  just go through the arms stock of european countries and you 'll see that many of them still have ussr made weapon systems .
