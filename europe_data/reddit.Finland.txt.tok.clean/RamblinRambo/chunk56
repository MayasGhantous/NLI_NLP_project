  i thought the smileys would be a hint , 
  oh i think you might be onto something !, 
  does n't happen in other countries . 
  think it would be an issue the first time , then it would become ** meh ** . 
  sweet !, 
  hold on ... so the next time i call the french assholes i actually have a source for it :d thanks !, 
  thanks for explaining . 
  is n't it very anti democratic to have to pay a deposit to run for public office ? 
  i mean the public decides who is n't serious by not voting them in so there 's no need to make it monetary . 
  i guess you 're right . 
   you never left the village you were born in , did you ? 
  i 've lived in four different countries . 
   good luck getting a pension 40 years from now . 
  you do know that whatever you pay to the state 's pension fund is used right now and not being saved somewhere for you to spend later , right ? 
  the world economy is already too efficient . 
  and instead of filling up the eu with immigrants that we can not provide jobs for it 's better to recruit them here when we actually need them . 
   funny , i have n't seen them risking their lives in shady construction jobs or providing humiliating care to the ever increasing number of old farts . 
  construction is dead in the eu at the moment . 
  care workers need education and communication skills in the language of the people they are caring for . 
  a sub saharan illiterate person will not be able to fill that position . 
  you 're just full of shit . 
  england is very much high-context , the worst of the lot of the british isles . 
  nowhere are you expected to read as much between the lines as in england . 
   in irish culture you 're free to say what you want , but it depends on the way you say it this is so true . 
  i still can not get my head around this mess . 
   i feel like i create unnecessary drama on a regular basis :d you just explained my two years in ireland . 
  i managed to piss people off all the time as they would get stuck on one word i said instead of looking at what was said holistically . 
  low , very much low . 
  when i lived in ireland i almost went nuts over people thinking i could read between the lines all the time . 
  i 'm used to people saying what they want as they want it and not expect me to know if a yes is a yes , maybe , kid-off , no or absolutely not . 
  the service of pixmania sucks balls though . 
   has europe tried to merge too many countries and people , with different living standards , languages and cultures , too quickly ? 
  yes . 
  yeah let us not have freedom of speech and opinion . 
  that worked out so well previously in history . 
   guess where the new work force that keeps the economy afloat comes from ... not form countries where people ca n't read or write . 
  this we need workers is such leftist hippie bs that it makes me sick . 
  we have millions of unemployed youth within the eu !, 
  closing the borders of the eu has to happen now and not tomorrow . 
  democracy is just a banner of what most countries are pretending to be . 
  i mean look at sweden , the whole country is on full blown censorship on some issues , their parliamentary parties get harassed by left wing protestors who even tried to physically attack the party leader . 
  just because they have the wrong opinion . 
  the only democracy in europe is switzerland . 
  deposit ? 
  what pisses me off is that non of the `` normal '' parties take on these issues . 
  so then we get a bunch of one question idiots voted in because people feel strongly about an issue . 
  there are many parties out there that traditionally would have shown us copyrighters the finger and said that they do not have anything to say about our laws . 
  suddenly they 're all lap dogs . 
  do n't know about that , but many in eu are n't crazy over turkey as a member . 
  austria for an example . 
  also think that finnish politicians would have a very hard time explaining to their people why they 'd let turkey in . 
  turkey will never join the eu . 
  ever . 
  even the corrupt eu politicians know that if turkey joins others will leave and the ones leaving will not be the `` bad apples '' . 
  i think a turkish entry into the eu would be the finals straw for many ordinary people . 
  i 'd say it 's more the parisians , the whole city is over taken by dicks . 
  my french colleague almost refuses to go to paris on business trips . 
  quoting him `` people in paris wake up , shove a lemon up their ass and go about being arrogant all day . '' . 
  usually when you see someone french on tv it 's someone from paris , at least abroad and the same when you meet french people the parisians are dicks and the people from other parts of the country are nice and friendly . 
  personally i 've only received looks and arrogance for speaking english in paris . 
  in smaller towns etc. 
  they 'll try their best to communicate with you even if they do n't know a word of english , especially older people . 
  they should make paris an own state and exclude them from europe . 
  it 's so gay . 
  just looking at the 20 largest states in eu vs. 
  california 38,332,521 , germany 81,840,000 2 . 
  texas 26,448,193 , united kingdom 64,231,000 3 . 
  new york 19,651,127 , france 63,702,000 4 . 
  florida 19,552,860 , italy 61,789,000 5 . 
  illinois 12,882,135 , spain 46,958,000 6 . 
  pennsylvania 12,773,801 , poland 38,548,000 7 . 
  ohio 11,570,808 , romania 19,858,000 8 . 
  georgia 9,992,167 , the netherlands 16,795,000 9 . 
  michigan 9,895,622 , belgium 11,162,000 10 . 
  north carolina 9,848,060 , greece 10,758,000 11 . 
  new jersey 8,899,339 , portugal 10,609,000 12 . 
  virginia 8,260,405 , czech republic 10,519,000 13 . 
  washington 6,971,406 , hungary 9,894,000 14 . 
  massachusetts 6,692,824 , sweden 9,595,000 15 . 
  arizona 6,626,624 , austria 8,477,000 16 . 
  indiana 6,570,902 , bulgaria 7,261,000 17 . 
  tennessee 6,495,978 , denmark 5,612,000 18 . 
  missouri 6,044,171 , finland 5,436,000 19 . 
  wisconsin , 5,742,713 , ireland 4,662,000 i mean germany has double the population of the most populous state in the us , california . 
  uk is two times more populous than the second most populous state in the us , texas . 
  nothing in his reasoning makes sense in this video . 
  hmmm ... 
  i bet you were drawing `` kirkkoveneit\u00e4 '' instead of looking at the pictures in the book . 
  eesti one is pretty bad ass as well . 
  lapuanliike , it 's though in history class in school as well . 
  dude were you sleeping again ? 
  romania wtf is that ? 
  :d :d :d, 
  damn romanians ca n't even count !, 
  : ddd edit : apparently some do n't get a joke . 
  large ... well that has distance to do with anything . 
  we have areas here in the north where you have to drive an hour to your nearest neighbour . 
  we still have free healthcare . 
  so big does n't cut it as an argument nor does population as we have 500 million here which i about 200 million more than the us . 
  has to be that then .
