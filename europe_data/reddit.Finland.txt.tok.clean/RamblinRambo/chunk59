  do n't care if it is double the population of finland the rest of the country is n't in europe . 
  damn that is some confusing information and the video is in spanish . 
  indian mangos are the best !, 
  fucking hell , do n't ban my mangos i love mangos :( :( :( :( and the way they serve them in india it 's like candy . 
  when it comes to armed forces it has n't arrived anywhere yet in full force . 
  why do we keep on getting turkey related posts in r/europe . 
  they are n't in europe except for a minute bit of useless land . 
  i 'm fairly sure that it is just a matter of time before one or two member states exit the eu . 
  my money is on the uk followed by one of the nordic countries or austria . 
  if eu in 10 years go an buy a three course dinner to a gypsy at restaurant of his choice . 
  the fact that this does n't exist so far down the road of eu just shows that it is n't working . 
  we only differ on immigration and there i 'd say that there is change happening in sweden . 
  in a recent study 49 % of swedes and 50 % of finns would be prepared to leave the eu and join a nordic union . 
  unfortunately i only find an article about it in swedish now . 
  a previous study in denmark showed that 47 % of danes are ready to do the same . 
   the opinion poll conducted by tns gallup in late march the following question to 1051 swedes and finns in 1013 :  suppose there could be established a nordic federation consisting of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden , with common policies in a wide range of areas , such as environmental policy , justice and foreign affairs , and trade agreements with the eu and other countries . 
  if you had to choose between that sweden would be included in this nordic covenant or be a member of the eu . 
  what would you have chosen ? 
   \u2022 a nordic association \u2022 swedish eu membership \u2022 do not know / no  of swedish respondents chose 28 % continued membership of the eu , 23 % said do not know / no and 49 % chose to be part of a nordic federation . 
   of those surveyed finns chose 31 % continued membership of the eu , 19 % do not know / no and 50 % chose to be part of a nordic federation . 
  in finland , the support for a nordic federal greatest among social democratic voters ( 73 % ) and lowest among coalition party voters ( 29 % ) . 
   iceland has already earlier this year withdrew its eu application and for norway 's eu membership is not current . 
   the survey results show that there is a great openness for a nordic alternative to eu membership among finns and swedes . 
  the previous danish findings indicate the same for danes ' part . 
  the issue of a nordic federation should be taken seriously in the nordic policies and discussed without reservation in and between the nordic countries . 
  the results from the opinion poll in whole , also unfortunately not in english : http://www.yggdrasil.fi/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/resultat-opinionsunders%c3%b6kningarna-finland-och-sverige.pdf, 
  well i bet you got this thread off to a good start . 
  i just see the word anal in that . 
  sounds horrible . 
  how on earth would the greek and the turks ever be in the `` same state '' . 
  it would be civil war in that state right away . 
   we actually agree on something precisely what i was thinking about your above comment in this topic . 
  i agree that it would not become more than a shittier version of the us . 
  however i do n't want any more integration though i 'd like the nordic countries to leave and establish a nordic union instead . 
  sure , but you also need to control the region and not just blow shit up . 
  this is where men on the ground become important and when you need own men on the ground it limits some parts of the weaponry you can use . 
  never thought this day would come , but for once i agree with you . 
  gypsy federation . 
  you are scary , seriously scary . 
  freedom of speech should not under any circumstances be limited . 
  if you remove the arms from the people it is just a question of time before you become the states bitch . 
  distribution of wealth is just a communist wet dream that i do not think most people want to be part of . 
  i 'd fight to the death to stop a unites states of europe from ever happening . 
  edit : just read this while checking my email and got five friends over who are not at all nationalistic in the sense of \u00fcber patriotic and i asked them what they though . 
  each one said that they 'd rather die fighting than becoming a part of anything like this . 
  i mean this is a group of highly educated people who work in an international environment . 
  i can just imagine how well this would be received by the wider population . 
  thank god this can never become a reality . 
  edit 2 : and russia !, 
  good luck convincing finland , estonia , lithuania , latvia , poland , romania , czech republic , slovakia etc. 
  to be in a union with russia . 
  hot damn we have a shit ton of artillery pieces , second most in the eu . 
   if they even have any worth deploying this is actually an interesting question . 
  if we look at the amount of troops that can be mobilised ( active/reserve ) per eu nation . 
  we can argue that if there is a threat that would call for real measures even reserves can be called in . 
  ** total ( active/reserve ) ** * austria : 52,963 * belgium 40,492 * bulgaria 51,550 * croatia 42,600 * cyprus 60,800 * czech rep. 28,920 * denmark 80,092 * estonia 87,258 * finland 388,700 * france 413,469 * germany 326,927 * greece 461,600 * hungary 85,450 * ireland 25,335 * italy 347,667 * latvia 16,611 * lithuania 30,150 * luxembourg 1,512 * malta 2,121 * the netherlands 67,641 * poland 663,000 * portugal 301,930 * romania 198,250 * slovakia 16,531 * slovenia 15,500 * spain 219,510 * sweden 50,200 * uk 387,570 ** five biggest active : ** * france 222,215 * uk 205,850 * germany 182,927 * italy 180,270 * greece 177,600 ** five biggest total ( active/reserve ) ** * greece 461,600 * france 413,469 * finland 388,700 * uk 387,570 * italy 347,667 source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel, 
  what makes it impossible is what we see here in r/europe every day . 
  people who are super pro eu or any other matter will go ape shit when someone tells a story that they do n't like . 
  if humanity accepted the truth about issues instead of just what they want to hear the wold would be a much better place . 
  russia may not have death penalty on paper , but we all know it very much exists . 
  especially if you 're a journalist . 
  they 're all shit , always . 
  the whole contest is just stupid and pointless and just a waste of time and brain cells . 
   our government is doing everything they can to destroy small businesses this seems to be a problem for the whole of eu . 
  well that was depressing ... ** ten ** countries with unemployment over 11 % . 
  i knew it before but seeing it on a map makes it so more tangible . 
  weird reading the comments it seems most nordic people got germany/austria . 
  hmmm maybe it is a first move towards a north european union , 
  same here . 
  germany for me !, 
  under a rock . 
  well russia forcefully moved people to prison camps , took territory from countries etc. 
  do you expect people to have any love for you . 
  the russians in estonia are like cockroaches , criminal and whining little bitches . 
  if they want respect they should pick up their shit and move across the border back to russia . 
  so you 're saying that the data showing that prices of basic goods have increased with a faster rate than the national inflation average since the euro was introduced can not be tied to the euro ? 
  well that makes sense ... 
  believe what you want but the data is there , feel free to find data that shows the opposite . 
  i 'd be more than happy if the increase in prise on basic goods would not have increased . 
  on the part of coffee sure , but eggs and meat are very much domestic if you look at the amount of meat sold and where it originated from . 
  i mean are we just going to brush off the fact that the people in the euro zone almost overwhelmingly feel that their purchasing power has reduced since their countries adopted the euro ? 
  as long as the inflation basket is a selection of very random products we 'll never get proper answers even if we use weighted averages . 
  the basket used to measure price inflation in finland is notoriously ridiculous and anyone who studies economics in finland knows this . 
  i mean in general it is hilarious how this subreddit continues to argue against facts as long as they are n't pro-eu . 
  i mean people here do n't seem to have damn clue about what inflation even is , yet they keep on talking about it . 
  the german finance minister admitted already in 2002 that the introduction of the euro caused prices to increase : http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/may/13/theeuro.europeanunion in finland the prices on basic goods in the last ten years have been way above the compounded inflation of finland for that same period which is approx . 
  * eggs +101 % * potatoes +148 % * coffee +88 % * minced meat +60 % * onions +48 % * milk +46 % * apples +36 % * toothpaste +33 % * butter +26 % * washing detergent +200 % the list goes on . 
  except for a few basic household products the cost of buying basic necessities in finland has increased . 
  a few of the ones that have seen a decrease in price for the same period : * bananas -1 % * cauliflower -24 % * lettuce -39 % * cucumber -14 % source if you want to calculate yourself : http://193.166.171.75/database/statfin/hin/khi/khi_fi.asp what people here do n't seem to understand is that official institutions that calculate inflation in each country select the basket of good used to the measurement . 
  the content of this basket is usually not known by people that are n't interested enough or curious enough to investigate . 
  once you look at the baskets you quickly realise how flawed they are . 
  i 've been to lasso baar ... :d many many many times . 
  estonia is n't in my opinion . 
  they just got grouped into the baltics after the fall of the ussr . 
  but culturally they 're in my opinion different from the rest of the baltics and more close to the nordics . 
  these kind of maps never make any sense . 
  instead they should be drawn after cultural similarities . 
  i mean croatian culture is more similar to italian culture than it will ever be polish culture . 
  if we grouped similar cultures together i think it would lead to more efficient management and co-operation within the blocks . 
  well yes and no .
