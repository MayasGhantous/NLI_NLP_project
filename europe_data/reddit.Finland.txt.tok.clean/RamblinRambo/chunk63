  even if people want to pretend that religion does n't matter it does . 
  easter , christmas and all other holidays to start with show how christian our traditions still are . 
  trying to manage a union with a muslim country is bound to end up going wrong . 
  on top of that it is n't really the beacon of democracy . 
  why would we ever allow a country that silences its people to be part of the eu ? 
  besides the majority of the country is n't even in europe . 
  i also have a hard time seeing enough countries supporting it for it to ever happen . 
  if it happened i am fairly sure we 'll start to see member states dropping out from the eu . 
  if i 'd to bet money on it , the first one to leave if turkey joins is austria followed by either denmark , finland or the uk . 
  all countries that the eu simply can not afford to loose . 
   ... bunch of brainless thugs . 
  now i 'd watch myself calling others brainless thugs when you ask people to go kill themselves . 
  you 're golden dawn fanatic, 
  russian is sexy when women speak it , i agree . 
  british . 
  italy do n't want you guys . 
  no one wa n't you , you 're like a deceased person and having you in the same house as anyone else is n't something anyone wants . 
  oh so now we see how intelligent you are . 
  especially when you have to take the comments to that level . 
  of course they 're going to ask you to pay interest every country has to . 
  what do you expect , that we treat you even more like a special needs kid and pay it all ? 
  it 's called a bailout because that is exactly what it is . 
  if you did n't get bailed our and receive subsidised loans you 'd be in an even worse crisis than you are now . 
  so yes , it is charity and a bailout . 
  besides no one gave you any cash because you 're their `` friend '' , they gave it as if they did n't you poor management of your economy would drag the whole euro to hell . 
  so unfortunately we end up paying for your stupidity as a nation . 
  just follows the temper and opinions/feelings of the people of europe . 
  if everything was calm we 'd have more positive threads . 
  well you call us nazis and you take our money and what do we get for that , jack shit besides whining and more whining followed by more begging so is it a surprise people are tired of you victimising yourselves . 
   i wo n't go into detail ... you do n't need to as we all know what that is . 
  it was charity . 
  and you 'll get my support any day for a greek exit from the union . 
  christ on a bike you are impossible , i give up . 
  you have clearly no clue about economics and there is no point in me arguing with you . 
  lol well unfortunately i ca n't vote for farage but i guess i will have to pick something similar . 
  i do n't agree with everything ukip seems to say , but i 'd love to see that man as the president of the commission . 
  he has a golden way of putting it straight out there . 
  empathy ? 
  exactly what should i have empathy for ? 
  the fact that greece is in the situation it itself created ? 
  no i do n't have any empathy for that . 
  it 's your creation and now you need to take the consequences of your bad decision like everyone else . 
  the loans you are given have interest rates lower than you could ever get without other countries bailing you out . 
  in each case you would pay interest . 
  but because you managed your economy like retards you have to pay a premium . 
  money is n't free , never has been and never will for any nation . 
  the interests are n't profits per se , they are cost of risk and that is just how the world works . 
  or are you saying that greece should be made the only country in the world that does n't have to pay interest on its debt ? 
  the reason greece was hit hard by austerity programs is because ** you did n't take care of your economy ** . 
  how in the actual fuck is that supposed to be anyone else 's fault ? 
  did someone tie a bomb around your balls and force you to take the loans before you were in so much debt that you could n't handle it ? 
  no , no one force you . 
  you elected your officials , more than a 100 000 people took out pensions illegally and people have been avoiding taxes for years . 
  so yeah f `` uck you i guess '' as you yourself nicely put it . 
  oh so greece is the only country in the emu that has had to deal with wars and payments to other nations . 
  finland paid enormous sums to the ussr after the war and are we crying over it and spending all our cash on pensioners that died 30 years ago and borrow more money we can afford to pay . 
  once again greek martyrdom nothing more . 
  get a backbone and start whining and do something about your monetary problems . 
  look at estonia it was occupied and sucked dry by the ussr as was poland and the rest of the baltic nations . 
  are they crying and whining ? 
  no they 're not , they decided to do something about it and especially estonia and poland have done a hell of a good job getting back into shape once the ussr fell . 
   it 's like you think they can come out of thin air or something that is exactly the case . 
  fractional reserve banking by it 's design involves money creation . 
  it is a fact and nothing but a fact . 
  here , study and learn : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/money_creation, 
  to be honest i do n't care about the greek , it does n't really matter what the greeks do or do n't as long as they do n't rely on everyone else to bail them out . 
  i 'm just fed up with this constant whining and no willingness to solve their own problems . 
  if that makes me hate the greek as a people in your eyes , well so be it . 
  well whatever . 
  when i see greece stop asking for more money i 'll believe it . 
  as it is now it 's just like a junkie kid who asks for more and more money from their parents while not getting its act together . 
  greek guarantees have very little trust attached to them . 
  greece has defaulted ** five ** times in modern times and that is just insane . 
   the combined length of period under which greece was in default during the modern era totaled 90 years , or approximately 50 % of the total period that the country has been independent . 
   - [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2011/09/28/debt-defaults-have-greek-history/ ) so someone telling me it will never happen again is ... well just not really something i care to believe in . 
  i do n't see an issue . 
  if it is a topic that interests people it will rise and if it is n't interesting it will be downvoted away . 
  burritos mmmmm jummy . 
  itt : a lot of angry greek `` victims '' . 
  seriously , talking to you is like talking to a brick wall . 
  as a serious recommendation to you , go and take some classes in economics . 
  you just do not seem to understand what you are talking about . 
  civil war ? 
  nah everyone else is just laughing at the greeks incompetence at this point . 
  sadly our leaders are pouring money into that black hole instead of cutting it off . 
  the worst that can happen is that a few angry feta cheese makers start stealing each-others goats and if it escalates it will be an internal greek thing . 
  well he is talking the truth regarding the current crisis . 
  nothing changes , the only constant is the greek government asking for more money . 
  look at ireland they 've left the bail out program while you guys are still occupying tv-stations . 
   the muslims appear exceptional anti intellectual well they are ... to be honest . 
  at least in the modern world it seems . 
  cry me a river . 
  it still does n't justify that your country did n't give a fuck about its finances and that is why you are where you are now . 
  blaming anyone else for it than yourselves is idiotic . 
  if your mentality is the mentality of the majority in greece you 'll end up becoming third world country . 
  basically every country in europe was part of the war and no one else whines over it anymore . 
  it 's time for the greek government and people to bite the bullet and pay for their negligence of their country . 
  ever heard of internal trade . 
  you know if you in spain go and buy a tomato grown in spain the value creation happens within the country . 
  furthermore as we have fractional reserve banking banks create money out of thin air so each state in the eu creates money through its financial institutions .
