  our power and heat production is basically completely independent from gas . 
  gas is only used as a substitute and we can live without it from the perspective of energy and heating . 
  i 'd recommend that you got your facts straight . 
   in 2010 the share of gas in tpes was about ** 10 % ** . 
  finland was 100 % dependent on a single supplier in gas , namely russia , and there is no gas storage capacity . 
  however , in finland , ** gas is essentially never used in direct heating of homes ** , which are heated by direct electric heating , oil or district heating . 
  75 % of gas is used for production of electricity or combined heat and power and in industry , with domestic use being rare . 
  in total , 93 % of the gas is sold to large installations directly rather than by retail . 
  in helsinki , however , there are 30,000 network-connected domestic gas users and 300 restaurants . 
  ** there is an alternative fuel obligation , so that in the event of a gas supply disturbance , other fuels can be immediately substituted ** . 
  the gas distribution network reaches only the southeastern coast , with the northernmost point at ikaalinen . 
  so you 're saying it is n't true that eu is regulating or that my stand on the eu should not regulate is n't true ? 
  what is dangerous is that we even call it separatism as the eu was never meant to be a country or a federation as it is looking to be now . 
  each member of the eu is a sovereign nation and thinking like you do is a very slippery slope to use your words . 
  so if you know this much and have live here for so long how come you 're so ill informed on the fact that the eu regulations and its policies have effects on other thing than logistics . 
  if you knew something about standardisation you 'd know that there 's no need for eu regulations on this . 
  but you do n't . 
  maybe that 's what putin is up to . 
  he does n't want to loose his deer . 
  jokes aside , as a hunter i find this very interesting . 
  muslims we 're dicks then as now . 
  it is like me trying to give advise on aboriginal issues without actually knowing less than half the story and it is clearly obvious you do n't know what the issues are on a broader basis . 
  the downvote button is for comments that do n't contribute to the discussion and you do n't so that 's why . 
  as i said supply chain efficiency is handled by the market and not by regulation . 
  standards are managed outside government much more efficiently and this has been done for years . 
  i work within logistics , i have a degree in supply chain management , i 've studied the issue , written a thesis on it , so i very much know what we do need and do n't from regulators regarding efficient logistics . 
  you clearly do n't . 
  the number of bureaucrats spending time regulating or standardising something on the behalf of the eu costs millions and it is not needed as it is already taken care of . 
  so drop the damn fruit and vegetable example as it was just an example . 
  an example of eu inefficiency . 
  you clearly do n't have anything smart to say so i 'll leave this discussion . 
  so an australian is telling me about how the eu works . 
  seriously you have no fucking clue . 
  these eu regulations are complete and utter nonsense and nothing more . 
  besides it was just a random example . 
  eu building regulations on energy saving are having direct consequences on our economy and not because our buildings are n't up to par but because they are well above the continent on energy efficiency . 
  this is just one little thing among hundreds . 
  regarding the `` easily packaged '' ... 
  i 've got a masters in supply chain management and i can promise you that the bend on a banana does not need government regulation as the market , suppliers and buyers take care of the efficiency of shipment themselves . 
  furthermore we have different industrial standards on international levels that manufacturers etc. 
  adhere to so there is no need for further complications . 
  energy is one example . 
  we 're not like the continent dependent on russian gas . 
  we have wast natural resources and the percentage of gas used for energy production is so small that there is already steps taken to eliminate this . 
  we do n't use gas for heating either . 
  we live in a cold climate and we 've always have to build our houses energy efficiently . 
  on energy efficiency we 've been ahead of most countries in the world for ages , and now when the eu slams some regulations on saving x % in each country it strikes us very hard as we were already on low figures . 
  we have long distances between populated areas in our northern parts and this gives a completely different set of challenges than the continent . 
  our wilderness possesses a threat and an opportunity on different levels that urban politicians on the continent can not understand and eu regulations often go against what we have to do . 
  example kill off wolves so that they do n't kill kids . 
  economically we 're all doing well and taken care of our budgets . 
  now the burden of helping states that did n't follow the rules is hitting us hard . 
  eu policies on russia are n't really in line with us either . 
  russia is the biggest importer of finnish products as an example , and we 're not dependent on their gas , so any conflict relating to that hurts our business . 
  these are just a few examples of a very long list . 
   do you think a complete union of the 5 nordic states into one federal state is workable , or do you just mean closer ties ? 
  very much so . 
  we had the [ nordic council ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council ) long before the eu . 
  we have had freedom of movement long before eu etc. 
  actually between the nordic countries eu has n't given us anything new when it comes to trade , movement , healthcare in a neighbouring country etc. 
  we are as you say low in population but we 're all huge countries ( except denmark ) in landmass . 
  wast wilderness , natural resources and different challenges than the continents . 
  i mean sweden is bigger by landmass than germany and finland and norway just about the same size as germany with only a few million people in each . 
  so when eu bureaucrats decide that we can not hunt wolves , it has a direct effect on families living in remote areas where their kids play outside and where these animals possess a threat . 
  just one example . 
  in a bit of a hurry here . 
  would love to go more into detail but i think you get the idea . 
  i am sure that we 'd work better as a union and even as a federal state than with the eu . 
  there 's nothing efficient with regulations on how bent a banana can be and what is the size a strawberry has to be . 
  the eu has become a bureaucratic monster out of control . 
  our nordic interests are n't represented there and we 're better off without the eu . 
  do n't mind trade but the rest of eu i 'm more than happy to part with . 
  eu may work on the continent but here up north i see that we 're too far removed from continental politics and just looking at our values , society and opinions in general we 're not really fond of the continental mind set of what is good and not . 
  nordic union is what we need . 
  this is the one i 've seen outside the city council . 
  saw it yesterday , but you 're right not really a flag its a pennant : http://www.cartinafinland.fi/fi/imagebank/image/17/17802/helsingin+kaupungin+viiri+17802.jpg, 
  these two videos explain this complicated system . 
  [ part 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrobz_hzzuc ) [ part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ropikze-c ), 
  it is very true . 
  finnish defence strategy does n't build on being able to keep the russians out . 
  it builds on making it very hard and as close as impossible to control . 
  if you can not control the region and or its people it becomes a major pain in the ass to keep it . 
  basically the foundation of finnish strategy lies in the use of our natural environment . 
  finland is covered by forest which allows us to move our troops there and launch disruptive attacks to the offender . 
  bridges , roads and other important infrastructure is still today built with this in mind . 
  if there was an invasion all major supply routes would be sabotaged internally and the gulf of finland mined . 
  then it would be a waiting game . 
  but in no way would it be a walk in the park and nothing says we 'd ever win . 
  but our best defence is in making it as much of a pain in the ass to not even want to try . 
  guess they 're wanting to win over some good publicity in the uk after how they 've done there lately . 
  i support this law . 
   is this a major concern for many europeans ? 
  depends on where you live . 
  i 'm in finland with the second longest border with russia after ukraine in europe and i 'm not worried at all . 
  some russian media has tried to make it sound like we are , but seriously have n't seen anyone yet that is worried here . 
  i personally do n't see any reason for russia to do anything to finland . 
  we 're too integrated with the west as we 've been since the second world war and we 're a huge exporter of western goods to russia which the russian economy needs . 
  a majority of their commodities from the west goes into russia on road from finland as shipping companies do n't trust russian harbour officials etc. 
  even during the cold war finland played an important political role in among others us-soviet relations as neutral ground for discussions . 
  we 've fairly well kept our hands away from russian politics and been a good neighbour in the sense that we 've left them alone if they left us alone .
