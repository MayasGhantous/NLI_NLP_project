  so if you 're a 4th generation somali in finland and want to snip parts of your kid off you can not do it here . 
  you calling it racism is just ridiculous . 
  what it is , is that it 's about giving people the option to make a decision when they 're mature enough to do so . 
  it 's not racist , it 's not discriminatory , it 's just common sense . 
  on a personal level , if you ask me , i 'm very against religion being forced upon people before they can make a conscious choice . 
  and i wo n't lie either i 'm very much against islam in particular as it for me represents violence , extremism and warmongering . 
  so now that 's out in the open too . 
  it does n't make me racist , fascist or anything else , i 'm just a person who does not tolerate that children are put under some religious idea just because someone else wants to . 
  well having opinions about circumcision is not fascist . 
  i suggest you go look up fascism . 
  here i 'll even help you , click [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism ) you clearly do n't understand what people are saying hence you 've got some issues with understanding the written word . 
  you know what , i know exactly the type of person you are . 
  only people going in to a discussion screaming racism and fascism are leftist nut jobs or muslims immigrants . 
  i guess you fall into both categories as it angered you so much . 
  and if me stating that makes me a racist/fascist/nazi in your eyes , so be it . 
   however , nuclear energy could only replace natural gas in the production of electricity . 
  it is not possible to heat millions of homes with the `` waste heat '' of few dozen power plants . 
  this is why the issue should be addressed on a country by country level if to be answered completely . 
  for continental europe russian gas is a necessity . 
  for the nordics it is n't . 
  i 'm no engineer but a big part of german heating could probably be replaced by the same kind of heating used in the nordics utilising heat waste from power and waste process plants . 
  even if you could only provide heating for 10 million people using that technology it 's still 10 million fewer dependant on russian gas . 
  the eu is really run by hippies . 
  i mean the shit they try to impose on the nordics on environmental stuff is just insane when we 're already 2 light years ahead with building/energy efficiency . 
  now they want to force us to get these levels down with an over all percentage . 
  well when we 've been freezing our asses off for the last 500 years we 've understood the importance of building well so expecting us to cut from already low waste from buildings at the same amount as the rest of europe is just stupid . 
  what the nordics needs is to leave this eu circus and create a nordic union . 
  we 're already excelling in education , heath care , economy and so on . 
  by uniting the nordics we 'd be the tenth largest economy in the world with about 25 million people . 
  our internal and external politics would be aligned to what nordics value and not what france , germany or the uk thinks . 
  beyond that we 'd have the natural resources to be self sufficient on many levels . 
  oil and gas form norway , minerals and forrest from sweden and finland just to mention a few . 
  why our nordic politicians do n't talk more about a nordic union than eu is beyond me . 
  we already have similar social welfare systems , our politics is almost identical , we 've had passport freedom and re-location freedom for i do n't know how many years . 
  the fact is that we 're basically a union already making it a federation would just remove the last bits of bs . 
  i 'd not complain if i could look at the eu form the rear view mirror . 
  we can still trade with the eu , we can still join forces in issues we agree upon . 
  or if we want to keep an eu it should be one with denmark , finland , sweden , norway , estonia , germany , the netherlands . 
  all countries that have fairly similar view on what they want and where they want to be . 
  why germany does n't push for a north and south eu is also a mystery , that would make a lot of sense in my world . 
  we still do n't use natural gas for heating . 
  i do n't know any building/municipality in at least finland and sweden that uses natural gas for heating . 
  it 's all based on hot water being pumped through the city . 
  this water is heated with waste energy from power plants and waste facilities . 
  nowadays waste energy from big server halls are being planned to be used as boosters for the heat instead of just letting it go to waste . 
   what sub am i in ?? 
  / r/whiterights your lack of reading comprehension is astonishing as well as sad . 
  religious practices do not have any place in our nordic health care system what so damn ever . 
  that is the issue here and nothing else . 
  if they wa n't someone to do this they have to pay for it themselves or go to their home countries to get it done as simple as that . 
  seriously get a grip . 
  well what about barseb\u00e4ck ? 
  i mean there was an election on it : http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/folkomr%c3%b6stningen_om_k%c3%a4rnkraften_i_sverige it also seems like they 've been following that model since the election . 
  really they should have a new election to see what people today think . 
  question is how well statistical records were kept back then . 
  well then i have to say that he was right on that issue . 
  sweden is a total mess when it comes to immigration . 
  not only that , the level of political correctness that has paralysed a whole generation is even scarier . 
  a nation where you can not have discussions in a civilised way on some issues is bound to get internal problems . 
  it 's just a matter of time . 
  what you get then is an extremist solution to the problem . 
  the fact that the swedish democrats are treated with no respect even if the public has elected them to represent their views is undermining the very fundamentals of democracy . 
  you might not agree with the views of everyone , but trying to force them to be quiet is the complete wrong way to go about it . 
  well at least he is honest and open with his opinions compared to 99.9 % of all other politicians . 
  so i 'll give him that . 
  you know what you get if you vote for him . 
  each time we have elections it 's like playing roulette with if they actually will stand for the ideas they had when i voted for them . 
  say they 'll support lower taxes and the first time the get to vote on it it 's the total opposite . 
  ** a ** n ** u ** s, 
  i have to say that i do n't know the economy of catalonia that well , so i have to ask ... how do they expect to survive economically ? 
  i mean does the region have enough industry etc. 
  to support itself if independent ? 
  truth is that the eu was dividing europe long before russia started to mess around in ukraine . 
  he has a point but the issue in ukraine is just the icing on the cake . 
  internally the opinion agains the eu among the citizens of its member states has n't been this low in ages . 
  possibly the lowest its ever been . 
  economy is in the shitter , countries who took care of their economy are bailing out the ones that did n't give a damn , taxes are increasing in all eu countries , prices on commodities are on the rice and unemployment is through the roof . 
  industry is crawling a dead crawl while all the eu does is to legislate on what the angle of a damn banana should be . 
  so blaming russia for dividing europe is just a sad excuse . 
  this is damn awesome . 
  haha, 
  i do n't think alcohol is the main reason at all . 
  honestly people drank more back in the day around europe and we 've never seen this many young people being as mentally ill as today . 
  problem is society in genera , demands from everyone that you should be successful and one does not have time to do what one gets pleasure from at all . 
  the speed of society has increased with technology . 
  we 're all connected to the level of crazy and we 're expected to do more than ever before . 
  sure we as humans worked harder back in the day , but we also had more time for ourselves , family and friends . 
  i honestly think it 's the biggest reason for the problem . 
  this is such a shame . 
  unfortunately i think that the current economic situation around the world is pushing this to increase for adults as well . 
  for teens i 'm not surprised that it seems to be more common as never before has teens been bombarded by as many demands from society as today topped up with media making everyone not a millionaire at the age of 12 a failure . 
  that 's how it should be . 
  this tradition has no place in the nordics . 
  ok it is obvious that you 're completely unaware of the nordic energy production and integration so i 'll just leave this conversation here . 
  read the alternatives to natural gas explained in this thread and you 'll get your answer . 
  and no i 'm not a nuclear power `` warrior '' i 'm just realistic and understand that it is the best long term energy source combined with renewables we have with todays technology . 
  gas and any other fossil fuel is a waste or time and makes you dependent on other nations and then you can have russia fucking you in the butt whenever they like to . 
  do n't know about the limits but we 're building more nuclear in finland as we speak . 
  i mean we 're only a country of 5.9 million so we 're quite well off with in regards to any limits . 
  edit : never mind understood you wrong there ,
