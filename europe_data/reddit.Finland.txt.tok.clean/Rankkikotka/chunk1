that would be [ lesbos ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesbos ) . 
  because it 's safe , simple and very fast . 
  * i am a patriot . 
  i love russian air and russian soil . 
  * * but we will reach the ganges river , * * and we will die in fights , * * to make our motherland shine * * from japan to england *, 
  by de facto forsakening international revolution , stalin created soviet union that acted like any other imperial power . 
  it was strange mix of chauvinistic russian expansionism and fake internationalism . 
  the `` nation '' in question was ussr , and it 's inhabitants were soviet citizens . 
  it 's called [ socialism in one country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism_in_one_country ) . 
  to make a mean cuba libre ? 
  also to assasinate enemy of the peoples revolution . 
  nobody forced me to learn english . 
  actually , i did go to english classes , but those were voluntary . 
  did not learn single language in school ( learnt english playing monkey island and fate of atlantis ) . 
   `` the sudeten situation and crimean situations are way too similar to just brush them off . '', 
   i told you the only similarity between those . 
  there is nothing more . 
  ...  russia has the same problem as germany in 1914 and 1939 : they feel surrounded and paranoid ( i can understand that when i look at the map ) . 
  and since ukraine came closer and closer to eu/nato , russia had to react . 
  it 's that simple . 
  they are just defending their national interests like everyone else . 
  so apparently there is more similarities to this . 
  you admitted it yourself right after you denied it . 
  that 's what i allways say , but then the mosquitoes arrive . 
  there 's allways something wrong in paradise . 
  dude , no . 
  just , no . 
  the sentence is the punishment . 
  there 's no reason to punish people while they 're in * prison * . 
  no matter what you do , prisoners are being educated ( in good and bad ) . 
  correctional institute must not be a con college ; it must be a place where people learn to be citizens once again . 
  there has been significant evolution of the that particular clause from 1948 ( ? ), 
  onwards , reaching it 's current form in lisbon accord in 2007 . 
  it 's an evolutionary process . 
  in addition most member states really heavily on nato for defence . 
  and eu is not meant to be an economic union ( alltough its core is exactly that ) , it 's a project that is meant to marry great powers in continental europe so thoroughly that war between them is unthinkable and self defeating . 
  as eu is a economical union at its core , blocking prospective member states from joining based on perceived military reason is kind of self defeating . 
  now , it 's certainly true that eu as a whole does lack capability to project power anywhere near the scale that usa is capable of . 
  it however has the economic and political capability to quite rapidly change the equation at least locally . 
  finland : people know that there 's a country called poland across the ocean . 
  that 's about it . 
  i read an article few days ago that claimed that there 's polish joke in every country - not in finland though !, 
  here 's an conversion i overheard at the store yesterday :  m : ` kay , we 've got everything , except m\u00e4mmi . 
   w : i 'm not going to eat it . 
   d : me neither . 
   m : well , i 'm going to eat it . 
  for sure this time . 
   w : that 's what you say every f * cking year . 
  you never do . 
  i 'm not one to eavesdrop , but it was quite loud and everyone heard it . 
  did not buy either . 
  they will be fingerprinted when registered . 
  neither does taking a gouda shower . 
  yeah , but right after that his cardboard hat will probably catch fire . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  i did a quick calculation , and russia has ~ 8.6 people/km ^ 2 to canada 's ~ 3.5 people/km ^ 2 . 
  it should be * easier * for russia to build infrastructure . 
  it 's common knowledge that aristotle stole that quote from albert einstein . 
  what 's with syrian doctors ? 
  one becomes a dictator , another one a people smuggler . 
  at which point they practice medicine ? 
  til, 
  according to google france is a big tuna . 
  i do n't know what to think about that . 
  you just did not call france fat ? 
  to be honest , the rates photoshop artist charge for rotating something 90 degrees are astounding . 
  that would certainly explain the price difference . 
  no matter how much i adore concorde from engineering point of view , it 's utterly useless piece of carbage from commercial standpoint . 
  [ they do n't understand it either .

  plot twist 7 : denmark can see dead people and the refugees are really ghosts . 
  now try ctrl + shift + t. 
  i would welcome close defense cooperation with sweden . 
  it 's true that you have let your army to decay somewhat , but sweden has * very * formidable arms industry . 
  those gripens and the subs you build are just cherry on top . 
  context accepted . 
  it 's just that every time i see the words guided and missile together , the first thing that pops in my head is an icbm . 
  ah yes , i see your confusion . 
  those are * unguided * missile systems . 
  it has effective firing range from 75 to 2500 m , while maximum being 4750 m ( from wikipedia ) . 
  it 's a * short * range guided missile . 
  is n't that the same thing that what i want ?

  i wonder how much of a shock the winter will be for those coming to north right now . 
  very soon it will be wet 24/7 with constant cloud cover , 16 hours of darkness per day , and if you 're lucky , you might see one hour of sunshine in * a month * . 
  i hope someone will remember to tell them to take enough vitamin d. 
  nah , we have properly insulated houses . 
  it 's warm all the time . 
  oooooh , you did not just go after their cooking . 
  hey , look everyone , / u/teamkiller91 just went after french cuisine . 
  * pops a bag of chips and takes comfortable position *, 
  by trying to invocate * their moral backbone * ? 
  good luck . 
  put them in trains , but seal the windows while they 're travelling trough eastern germany . 
  that 's how they did it last time . 
  edit . 
  to clarify , not talking about * those * trains , but these : [ jubilant east germans cross to west in sealed trains ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/06/world/jubilant-east-germans-cross-to-west-in-sealed-trains.html ) . 
  if i understand you correctly , it will be another 20 years until the joke is funny again ? 
  so , it should be online about 20 years from now ? 
  that sound about right ?
