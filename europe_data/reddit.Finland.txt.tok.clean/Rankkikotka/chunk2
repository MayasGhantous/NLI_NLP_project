  i should definitely invest in eastern poland . 
  you sure talk a lot without anything to say . 
  with friends like these , what do we need isis for ? 
  what , you mean something like a phone ? 
  damn it , just as i was about to perfect my hot air engine . 
  the searching detectives searched the searcing detective . 
  quiet , radene !, 
  we are n't even to speak of that sword !, 
  tovarishch please . 
  but , but ... what about our [ architecture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/guzulhb.jpg ) ? 
  if those wo n't do anything for you , there 's always the world famous [ mika h\u00e4kkinen square ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dlf1n88.jpg ) . 
  i 'm aware of these systems . 
  my problem is with the bank acting as middle man there . 
  i just do n't trust them not to take advantage of this . 
  fleamarkets run on cash . 
  fuck me if i ca n't receive money without bank aproval for that 20 eurocent wossname i just sold . 
  til . 
  i have sweet memories of those flowers , as they grew everywhere around my childhood home . 
  finland was allied with the nazi germany . 
  it was aware and participated in operation [ barbarossa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) . 
  finnish officers we 're present in the camps they operated . 
  it 's obvious you have very sugarcoated opinion of finnish history . 
  i 'd study the subject even a little bit more before you embarrass yourself more on the internet . 
  [ and now for something completely different ] ( https://youtu.be/fbwkkxgmfri ), 
  ` space corps super-chimps performing acts of indecency in zero-gravity will lose all banana privileges . ', 
  ah yes , the good old atlantic wall . 
  what coud go wrong ? 
  i 'm pretty sure * never * is spelled just like that . 
  it 's easy as long as you remember to conjugate * kumarreksituteskenteleentuvaisehkollaismaisekkuudellisenneskenteluttelemattomammuuksissansakkaankopahan * correctly . 
  after that it 's like walk in the park . 
  not with that attitude . 
  that 's ignorant . 
  slaves should be whipped in the front yard for all to see . 
  how else you can keep them in check ? 
  it is [ rather nifty hat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y0awrfh.jpg ) , so i do n't blame him . 
  my favorite is [ finnish lapphund ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_lapphund ) . 
  it 's very old working dog breed ( used to herd reindeer ) , which was standardized in 1945 . 
  they are smart as fuck ( the young one that came to us few month back has learned to open safety locks all by herself . 
  it learns thing with very little repetition ) and long lived . 
  you just want the beaches for hairy greek chests only . 
  how about a fez ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_waffen_mountain_division_of_the_ss_handschar_ ( 1st_croatian ), 
  it 's like they just put in phobia there to spin the news . 
  that is unfortunately true . 
  most people can be bough if the price is right , no matter who is doing the buying . 
  i 'd sell my grandmother for about tree fiddy . 
  ooh , i 'd hate to see what happens when weather is bad . 
  well worth it . 
  such value for money . 
  just whoo , hoo , hoot you mean ? 
  after the first bite is owl you can eat . 
  you ca n't kill an idea , and not certainly by military action . 
  prosecuting ( in a court of law , not quantanamo ) those individuals responsible for planning the attacks would have gone a long way making it less attractive though . 
  waging military campaign and nation building only served to make the idea stronger and was great recruiting material for terrorist organisations . 
  they made bin laden a martyr instead of sentenced criminal . 
  you ca n't buy that kind of publicity . 
  now the mid-east is in flames , and it 's partially because of the heavy handed , undirected and naive approach of the bush administration . 
  they should have gone after al qaeda stronger . 
  they were on the verge of major victory at tora bora but bin laden escaped . 
  then came iraq and effort and concentration lapsed in afghanistan . 
  what should have been forceful `` police operation '' that should have ended with prosecution of those responsible with 9/11 became silly nation building effort instead . 
  not for long . 
  of course , and i 'm pretty sure most germans sneak a peak as well . 
  that 's right !, 
  it 's like we cant . . krh . . we ca n't . . rgghk . . sorry , there 's something stuck in my throath ... rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz . 
  ah , now it 's better . 
  what were you saying again ? 
  you 're the fifth person today asking for the new cordless drill , but i keep telling you lot , that there 's simply no markets for them !, 
  this hand drill has always been a good seller though ... 
  for all the useless crap you can buy from skymall , this is actually pretty cool . 
  depending where in russia you 're flying to , this might even come handy . 
  either that 's a very small aircraft or one huge luggage . 
  that 's right , just imagine the contributions people like / u/executivemonkey can make towards raising the standard and popularity of tennis in asia . 
  swedish , no doubt about it . 
  when you 've learned swedish , * all * the other languages are very easy to learn because they 're so similar . 
  which one ? 
  was it sunnuntaikalsarik\u00e4nnittelisink\u00f6h\u00e4n ( i wonder , should i get drunk wearing only long johns on a sunday ) or sunnuntaikalsarik\u00e4nnittelemisiimme ( until next time we get drunk wearing only long johns on a sunday ) ? 
  you know brit too ? 
  she makes * awesome * cupcakes , and she said that rudolphs nose is not really red , but just painted that way . 
  did you paint rudolph ? 
  i think that 's mean , and santa ca n't be mean . 
  and i know north pole is not really in * north pole * , that would be silly . 
  so anyway , i 'll see you next christmas . 
  mary says she would really like it , if you could bring mom and dad back . 
  dear santa i have been a very good boy , no matter what mary says . 
  for christmas i want the playstation and the virtual glasses . 
  then i want a new bike , a skateboard , some marmalade but not the bad kind . 
  and i want a computer and an iphone and an android and my sister does not need anything . 
  naturally . 
  miscommunications are rife though , because we are so extremely drunk all the time . 
  [ i want to believe . 
  i 'm just imaging an swedish emergency meeting . 
  the flood is rising , house is in fire and the locust are swarming . 
  que a nondescript conference room where a group of people are having a coffee and a bun before they really start to * diskutera * . 
  - * but first , we must let kalle from warehouse to tell his opinion . 
  [ here , i fix for you . 
  yet the end result is kind of similar . 
  everything i 've learned about restoring old towers i learned watching time team . 
  it seems that often the reinforcing is done simply by adding rebar and scaffolding . 
  i quite like [ this approach ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/artefactporn/comments/34xdlz/an_outline_overlay_reconstructs_the_damaged/ ) .
