  i do n't however think they did bad job on that castle . 
  this way the original material is very easy to distinguish from modern , and you can really see the shape of the building . 
  it acts pretty much as a scaffolding , and is a very interesting approach to restauration . 
  base, 
  from the point of view of whoever does the bashing certainly . 
  because it 's easier to do that way . 
  i also wanted to use them in a sentence . 
  you have to start from somewhere . 
  some retarded scheme where you ban * all * `` bad '' words at the same time would be quite idiotic indeed . 
  they really pippi l\u00e5ngstrumped it this time . 
  / r/russiadenies, 
  in ~ ~ america ~ ~ europe , you break law . 
  in ~ ~ soviet russia ~ ~ moderate islam , law breaks you !, 
  i hate when that happens . 
  good you like it . 
  here 's why i do n't . 
  when they decided to take one of the most powerful dc characters and then proceeded to defang , and then insert him into a police procedual they could have called it anything else but this . 
  where are the stunning visuals or the philosophical bent ? 
  by now we should have seen how he ignited the first stars or created whole new universe free from that meddlesome old fool . 
  instead we get this tv-mentalist whose highhest achievment is seducing his * therapist * . 
  whining about television , at badly adapted shows even , is waste of time and effort . 
  original is original and adaptation is adaptation . 
  just why they had to make his hair dark , when the dude should be peroxide blonde ? 
  moose are cops in russia ? 
  that explains why my sister was bitten when she visited moscow . 
  i do n't usually whine about shitty adaptations , but what in the hell ( as it sure enough was not lucifer ) made them do it as a buddy cop show ? 
  it has the stink of meddling producer all over . 
  syrian ceasefire does not extend to libya . 
  i really have to try that armed robbery then . 
  do you just walk up on people and take their money , or should one specialize ? 
  i 'd have guessed that one would get into some mission impossible level of stuff with hacking skills , but i guess that 's just hollywood for you . 
  those damn abba fans are a nuisance . 
  also forced to hide his taliban brothers loyalties from the already suspicious and nosy neighbor jeff , who just so happens to be a semi retired cia spook . 
  hijinks ensue . 
  i agree , let 's get it together people . 
  and in getting it together i will off course help , because it 's me , bill . 
  * bill smith * from haight-ashbury , new york . 
  i 've been right here , impersonating a finnish person exposing communists , but really i 'm american trough and trough . 
  now that we got that covered out , would anyone know anything about the * nuclear vessels * ? 
  or the army base located at 37 \u00b0 14 \u2032 06 \u2033 n , 115 \u00b0 48 \u2032 40 \u2033 w ? 
  i 'm only asking because of the stinking communists of course . 
  found the commie mole , no american flag can be oversized . 
  ah-ha , got you there !, 
  i 'll just use the shadow as a sundial !, 
  it 's secret . 
  but then again ( * and we have been talking about this * , do n't deny it ) , we really do need a new drummer . 
  denmark just ca n't keep the rhytm . 
  there , i said it . 
  we do n't have to kick denmark out , just make him a back up singer !, 
  or a * kick ass dancer * , how about that ? 
  every band needs a dancer , and that way he does not have to be heard at all !, 
  that 's right , you have to know the secret handshake as well !, 
  you know , i was n't going to post this , [ but then again ... ] ( https://youtu.be/pw3e64soseg ), 
   `` i have nothing against you , '' he said , `` but where i 'm from , this is handled by men . '', 
  and what a wonderful job they do '' * handling it * '' . 
  * levottomat 3 * is spot on . 
  it 's just ... * so * . 
  not the kind of shitty that 's the good kind - not even close . 
  the first one is massive * meh * , and this is ^ 3 . 
  there are no words . 
  damn that thing is fast off the pad . 
  what 's the twr ? 
  they 'd be looking at you , because let 's be honest , you 're the only one there . 
  i for one would like to suggest , that there is an immediate and pressing need to ban my genitalia . 
  yeah , it 's basically version of baseball without the boredom . 
  [ wife-carrying ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wife-carrying ) and [ swamp soccer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swamp_football ) . 
  also [ world sauna championships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_sauna_championships ) , but we stopped doing that because it 's too deadly . 
  all right . 
  have i answered all your customer concerns in a timely , polite manner ? 
  anyone who calls someone * my friend * , is anything but friendly person . 
  how much there is room to raise the pension age though ? 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retirement_age#retirement_age_by_country ) retirement age is 60 for men , 55 for women , whereas [ life expectancy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia#life_expectancy ) is 65,1 years for men and 76,5 years for women . 
  [ screams inside . 
  you have to lift with your legs , not your back . 
  take a solid stance with a low center of gravity and * push * . 
  it 's rather simple if you remember to use the power of the tank against itself . 
  that 's right , just reverse polarity on that sucker , and you 're good to go . 
  smokes , let 's go . 
  that pretty much what i think as well . 
  i do n't believe i have painted a black and white picture of it either . 
  after international revolution failed in other countries , ussr pretty much became a russian-centric project . 
  i think the tipping point was somewhere between lenin signing on for finnish independence ( and hoping that sdp would seize the power ) , and him taking a very different stance on ukrainian independence . 
  50/50 split of power balance between russia and other states is not a realistic number in my opinion . 
  russia was very much the hard core of soviet union . 
  what was international revolution soon became communism in one state . 
  communist russia , or more precisely the communist party , acted much like an empire , which it indeed was . 
  it conquered nations by either armed forces or subversion , and either annexed them or installed puppet governments to rule them . 
  there were exceptions to this like yugoslavia or china . 
  dont ' t get me wrong though , i 'm not really disagreeing with much of what you 've said . 
  ussr was much more complex entity than just russia , however the former could have never happened without the later . 
  there 's no doubt however that russia had the most weight and influence by far in the union . 
  russian federation of today is the successor state of soviet union . 
  stalin is the greatest russian ever when it 's about the achievments . 
  when talkin about his crimes he suddenly becomes that dirty georgian dude , no way russian people had anything to do with his crimes . 
  ah , so it 's a communist dictatorship then . 
  1986 renault is anything but reliable , i 've owned one . 
  soyz on the other hand is * the best * rocket to get around ( shenzou might come close , but as it lacks the track record of soyuz i would categorize it as the second best ) . 
  still very reliable . 
  i would n't call soyuz ancient equipment . 
  it 's been incrementally improved from the get go , and is pretty different system than the one first launched in -66 .
