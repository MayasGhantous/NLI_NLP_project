  it 's extremely reliable workhorse with amazing prestige . 
  some just have to do their doodling in the [ voting booth though ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/2015042019552201_eb.shtml ) . 
  right in the article , one chapter from the top ( sigh ) :  according to french daily le figaro , the knife-wielding assailant was drunk and could be heard shouting anti-semitic slurs at the time of the assault . 
   according to the report , the assailant is mentally unstable and is known to local police . 
  he was arrested near the scene shortly after the attack . 
   police say they believe shao and the women had been conspiring to commit threatening behaviour ; all three reject this claim . 
  what the fuck is this bullshit united kingdom ? 
  i thought you were cool . 
  so a very , very late abortion then ? 
  no , it 's pretty much like he said . 
  eliminate germany ? 
  still on reddit ? 
  just grab your rifle already and * go * . 
  people like you are the reason for moose wrecks on the road . 
  not if we build a tunnel to tallinn first !, 
  but seriously , let 's build a tunnel . 
   german chancellor angela merkel harshly criticized eastern european governments for not having learned from their own history in their responses to the migration crisis . 
  someone could say , that the last time eastern europe had migration crisis it was called lebensraum . 
  that someone would certainly not be me . 
  i actually feel quite bad making that joke , and not only because it 's so old . 
  when i started drinking beer , i could make a choise between crappy lager , crappy lager and crappy lager . 
  there 's something very positive to be said about craft beer boom that largely originated from states . 
  now i can walk to the store , and even badly stocked one has real variety . 
  there 's ipas , apas , dark lagers , dark stouts , filtered beers , unfiltered beers , beers with character or beers that are fucking close to water . 
  this is the last fucking time i mock american beer , unless it 's really , really funny . 
  fucking close to water ? 
  does n't mean university here either . 
  the vocational school is separate from college though , so that 's the source of my confusion . 
  there 's no way that you pass without knowing your stuff ( i 've acquired my competence by taking that exam . 
  studied for a year before the test ) . 
  the finnish electrical code is a brick as well , and you really need few weeks of guidance just to learn to read it . 
  that being said , anyone can just waltz to the exam , and if they pass , they 're considered qualified . 
  uk requires college education from electricians ? 
  somehow i find that rather hard to believe . 
  at least in finland it 's possible to demonstrate your competence by completing [ competence based qualifications ] ( http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/competence_based_qualifications_for_adults ) . 
  if one 's good at what he/she does , it will take about days time . 
  heir today , gone tomorrow . 
  that 's nobody 's business but the turks . 
  it 's like they could dough no wrong . 
  they also had more tanks than germans . 
  i see parallels in attitude with gawker , and we know how that turned out . 
  about 7 pints . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.discogs.com/various-teenage-wasteland-16-early-fave-raves-of-the-president-toomas-hendrik-ilves/release/7889206 ) . 
  the way it works , is that you 'll get awarded those kind of figures for quite modest speeding , but need to earn millions to qualify . 
  i once got fined few grands for speeding 18 km/h , but that was a year i sold my house . 
  got that reasoned to ~ 1.5 k $ in court though . 
  yes i am , but also [ finnish ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/ ) . 
  those are thousands of euros , right ?

  i trust a swede to be a swede though . 
  if the weather conditions are just right , you can see [ mirage of tallinn ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/hwjhq ) ( and i suppose vice versa ) from helsinki . 
  i do n't drink to live . 
  i live to drink . 
  i have definitely heard it in helsinki this year . 
  godfather i+ii+iii , marathon session of the sopranos and goodfellas . 
  except the swedes of course . 
  even old new york was once new amsterdam . 
  i was lonely , sad man contemplating suicide . 
  the i invested in eastern poland , and everything changed . 
  now supermodels wo n't leave me alone and i jet around globe in my private plane dining on the finest cuisine world has to offer . 
  thanks eastern poland !, 
  not that there is much to work with , but that haircut looks shitty . 
  china or soviet union led by full war time german cabinet ? 
  rather unusual fancy , but i 'm certain there is a mod for it . 
  yeah , fuck those scumbacks !, 
  they 're just bunch of lawyers anyway ... 
  he curbed his enthusiasm to leave ? 
  i thought you guys made that illegal ? 
  so the finnish stereotype of swedes being really , * really * gay might actually become reality . 
  we need to figure something else to make really stupid jokes , and rather sooner than later too . 
  my friends brother lives in sweden . 
  visited there once and we had a picnic . 
  never again you fucking weirdos . 
  so just regular top gear then . 
  do n't give kremlin any water after midnight or there will be trouble . 
  any [ old 2 euro coin ] ( https://m.imgur.com/w2dih3m?r ) . 
  we had balls back then . 
  you see , words are like bullets . 
  modern english , or ye olde english ?

  yeah , it 's a bummer . 
  we have had to adapt , and now we lob vodka bottles filled with methanol at them . 
  no , no . 
  we must warm their cool heads with a * hot * island song . 
  something about `` only bastards allowed '' . 
  you know , i tried to visit sweden once , but they turned me away from the border after they found out my parents were married . 
  no , the one before that . 
  the one with the 7 samurai . 
  what a complete bastards , with no regards to their neighbors or safety . 
  on the other hand , we 've had few serious butane explosions , when people have dabbled in butane extractions and what not * indoors * . 
  fucking muppets they are . 
  if they 're the best , why they deal that shit quality hashish then ? 
  come to think of it , that low quality brick was propably * the * reason homegrown reigns supreme these days . 
  did you know that ankara in finnish means * harsh * ? 
  so * ankara talvi ankarassa * translates as * harsh winter in ankara * . 
  ** edit . 
  ** a letter . 
  but sweden * is * a batshit insane country . 
  i 've visited many times , and base my opinions on the things i experienced there . 
  first of all , we were minding our own business at the park , and some workmates of our host came to greet us .
