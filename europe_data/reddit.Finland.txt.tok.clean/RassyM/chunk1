automation is not a new concept . 
  it has more or less already been on the agenda for several decades , centuries if you will . 
  you could apply the same concept we talk about today of `` automation '' to the industrial revolution . 
  not many decades ago every business had a room full of people calculating whatever middle-management told them all day long . 
  the same job is today done by one person with office excel . 
  when my grandfather was little it took the whole family and neighbors to harvest a field of cereals . 
  today the same job is done by one person in a specialized tractor . 
  did the unemployment rate go up vastly from then until now ? 
  did the balance of sectors important for the economy change ? 
  yes . 
  automation is going to get rid of the unskilled lower level jobs usually consisting of mundane tasks . 
  sure , you may not be able to become a cashier in 50 years , but are people complaining about not being able to become log drivers , lamplighters , chimney sweepers or coal hurriers today ? 
  history tells us that when jobs disappear there will be other jobs to replace those . 
  these tend to be more advanced and less mundane than the previous ones . 
  so in reality society tends to change for the better . 
  using the argument about automation as a counterargument against education does n't make any sense whatsoever . 
  in fact , future jobs will require more knowledge than before . 
  i mean , the new tech and machines are n't going to engineer themselves . 
  my grandfather grew up in a family of workers . 
  he went to school for only 4 years . 
  he started working at 13 and that was standard for working class people back then . 
  how well do you think that would fare in todays world ? 
   studying solves nothing . 
  that 's the wrong attitude . 
  studying is rarely a short-term solution , nor should it be seen as one . 
  if you do n't find work you should study . 
  simply because that 's the best you can do . 
  even if you ca n't do anything with the knowledge in the short term it will definitely better your prospects when the job market turns for the better . 
  it adds competitiveness and means you wo n't have to start from zero again when that happens . 
  think about it . 
  you now have a situation with a lot of unemployed young people . 
  some are studying whereas others are riding it out on the couch at home . 
  but when the money machine gets going again , who do you think will be employed first ? 
  it 's there to keep you from hurting yourself during extreme turbulence . 
  having spoken to a stewardess such turbulence happens once every few weeks , and it happens that people get hurt from time to time . 
  so yeah , airplane seatbelts really do have a use , stastistically even more frequently than seatbelts in cars . 
   people say its free trade with the us which is n't much of a plus since tariffs are so low with the us and most us corps have local subsidiaries in the eu anyway . 
  this is entirely true . 
  from this perspective we have only minor advantages to win from a free-trade agreement . 
  there is however one major drawback currently in existence that the ttip aims to eliminate , and that 's the bureaucracy . 
  which definitely is the bigger devil than the tariffs in itself . 
  currently we have double regulation in trade between the us and eu , i.e both parties have their own regulation-sheets that for the most part consists of the same measures . 
  currently there 's little transparency between these which means that everything has to pass through two separate systems that essentially do the same thing . 
  not only is this a waste of time but it also makes up external tariffs . 
  the ttip proposes means to overlap the regulation which would essentially mean that something investigated in eu could essentially be a turn-key product on the us market as well , and vice versa . 
  this would be highly helpful for industries like pharmaceuticals , agriculture and finance . 
  for a lot of bigger production companies the ttip may mean little since they already have existing systems in play for both markets . 
  however , this has a potential to aid fast growth industries as well as small business which are not big enough to have such measures in play yet . 
  this is where there exists potential for boosting efficiency of innovation which in return means job creation . 
  the biggest factor against the ttip is obviously that we may stand to lose a part of those economies of scale which we already have , i.e higher food standards and consumer rights . 
  there 's also a lot of controversy in mostly from minor propositions within the agreement concerning digital rights , environment , market regulation and some have even said it infringes on sovereignty . 
  as a whole i think the agreement is more good than bad . 
  but it 's important to point out is that we ca n't really know with certainty how the free-trade would play out yet since this is the first time in human history when we propose free-trade between what is essentially half the global economy . 
  you 're not the first one to say that . 
  somewhat . 
  combining helsinki and tallinn could create a bigger player to counter what is now the `` greater st. petersburg region of influence '' . 
   and i do n't think , based on historical facts , that corporations ' lust for profit benefits society in any way . 
  what you 're basically saying is that you do n't believe that striving for higher gdp benefits a country , because it is the businesses , with their incentive of profit that makes up a countrys competitiveness . 
  furthermore , this lust for profit is what creates jobs . 
  why the hell should people start businesses , grow existing businesses ( and this all creates jobs ) if profit is forbidden or frowned upon ? 
  in finland , if you acquire your driver 's licence during the interim training period & training part of advanced stage in an automatic car you 'll not be allowed to drive cars with manual transmission in the future . 
  so yes , we have that in some sense , although its more meant for people with disabilities . 
  for `` normal people '' it 's pretty much a no-brainer that everyone takes their licence in a manual car . 
  i do n't think many take the automatic route , i 've personally never heard of anyone doing that . 
  after all , all driving schools go with manual cars exclusively . 
  there are some stages before getting the final license in which you can drive an automatic car and still get a `` real '' driver 's license ; the `` self learning '' training period when you have a temporary driving license and some mandatory training-stages in the advanced stage ( after self training phase right before getting the permanent license ) like dark time driving and the slippery driving course training . 
  you do n't need the ussr or communism to have all of those . 
  most of europe has all of those . 
  what russia needs is to get that corruption of yours in check . 
  this is deeply rooted from the ussr where bribery was a common occurrence for anyone seeking to invest . 
  the ussr had more white-collar financial crime than any western `` capitalist '' state in the 80s , ironic is n't it ? 
  why do you think little estonia has better life standards for its people than big russia only 2 decades after the fall of ussr ? 
  russia is home to one of the largest natural resource reserves in the world , so logically that should be the other way around ... 
  i 'll let that settle in for a second . 
  alexander stubb is seen as a `` dark horse '' for many finns . 
  it 's not that people do n't like him , they certainly do , it 's more that stubb has had very little to do with interior policy , and that he 's almost unconditionally known for his international affairs . 
  the biggest obvious change is that stubb is openly pro-nato membership . 
  katainen was pro-nato as well , but he never took it further than personal statements . 
  i do n't think we 'll see much of a change in policy . 
  stubb will most probably take over from where katainen left and continue such policy that will boost their chances of victory in parliamentary elections next spring . 
   race is the real factor , islam is not a white ( indo-european ) religion , but arabic ( semitic ) . 
  these are two more pointless generalisation you make ... you imply that most muslims are arabic in both region and racial similarity . 
  both those statements are ** false ** . 
  what if i told you only \u2248 20 % of muslims live in the middle east ? 
  the biggest region of muslims is in fact south asia ( think bangladesh , india , pakistan etc. 
  ) , not the arabic countries . 
  these countries are all ethnically diverse , historically much more so than europe . 
  different ethnicities and religions have more or less learned to live side by side for ages already . 
  so saying that islam can not live side by side with different cultures is completely horseshit because islam itself is a religion consisting of hundreds of completely different ethnic peoples all with their own cultures . 
   never smoked in my life , but the government has no job dictating the bloody packaging ( aside from obvious sanitation issues ) of private products . 
  neither have i : my uncle just turned 67 and has chain-smoked for his entire life . 
  thankfully he still is in great shape . 
  however , according to statistics ** half ** of all smoking males ** will be dead by 67 ** . 
  so according to statistics half of his smoking peers should be dead by now . 
  67 is just a few years after retirement . 
  that also means we can assume that a large part of all smoking men will have an early heart attack , stroke or cancer while still in appropriate `` working age '' due to his smoking habit . 
  ** who pays the resulting bill for the care , or at least a large part of it ? 
  ** - i do , and so do you . 
  other factors like missed taxable years due to sickness or forced early retirement is also a factor that is negative to the economy . 
  you can not go back to work for quite some time , if ever , after a major stroke in your later years .
