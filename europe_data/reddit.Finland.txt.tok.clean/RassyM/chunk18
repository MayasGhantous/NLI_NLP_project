  relative poverty measures social inclusion . 
  either by measuring income disparity or equality of opportunity . 
  poverty is very often a side effect of a high income disparity or bad opportunities , but it does n't have to be . 
  as an example , relative poverty can also be measured in different ways and one way is by gini-coefficient . 
  if you assume you can demonstrate poverty using gini you would get a wrong result , since a nice part of a city would still yield relative poverty even though those identified in the poorest group are actually middle class . 
  the problem here is that uninformed people might use relative poverty metrics synonymous with poverty . 
  this would lead to other types of fallacies such as confirmation bias , reporting bias and experimenter 's bias . 
  finnish defense is based on the notion of making war so expensive for an invader that they would never choose that option . 
  finnish defense is 100 % defensive warfare only . 
  we actually have a defense that meets this goal quite successfully even without nato help . 
  the goal in a situation of war is to protect , and make advances by the enemy problematic , wasteful and expensive in order to drive our leaders to sit down at the treaty table instead . 
  however , this does n't mean we do n't see the good sides in joining alliances . 
  a lot of people here in finland have started to favor a nato membership after recent intimidation from east . 
  the reason why we have n't so far is the perception by many that smaller nato members end up fighting in wars started by representatives of the bigger members , e.g. 
  bush triggering article 5 after 9/11 , or how erdogan was thinking of triggering it in 2012 are often used in nato-membership debating in finland . 
  the esta has to filled out even if your end destination is n't within the us . 
  flying to toronto with a connecting flight in jfk ? 
  - fill out an esta please . 
  in their defence though , the esta is valid for some time and you only have to fill it out every couple of years . 
  you 're voting for national policy in council elections ? 
  hate to break it to you , but the finnish immigration policy is not outlined by hankasalmi municipal council . 
  council elections are about questions close to you ; a new sport-field etc. 
  the true finns are losing voters because populism , surprise surprise , is n't very good at governing and the party is completely disorganised . 
  in my city , the true finns candidate that got the most votes in 2012 attended only a single council meeting . 
   eia identified a shipment of 1,278 pieces of teak costing 174,750 euros ( us$ 186,000 ) being used aboard the yacht . 
  this is interesting , because that 's not a lot of teak for a yacht that big at market price . 
  teak decking can easily cost $ 15-20k for 40-50 foot sailing boats , and this superyacht has hundreds of times larger deck surface compared to one of those . 
  so this yacht either only has minor details done in teak , or the teak was acquired x10 below market price . 
  if it 's the latter , they are completely right in raising suspicion .

  aww thanks netherlands !, 
  please inform hr that i 'll gladly take that job of yours !, 
  only because mobile plans in germany are a joke . 
  why would you otherwise need wlan in a city ? 
  you can just connect your computer to your smartphone . 
  that 's a much superior technology that has been around for too many years to not be standard . 
  in helsinki $ 26 buys me unlimited 4g with speeds ranging between around 30-50m . 
  the equivalent plan on telekom de costs $ 199,95 per month . 
  wtf !, 
  the thing is that norway has invested their oil profits for society . 
  despite only having 5 million citizens norway holds the wealthiest sovereign wealth fund in the world . 
  norway 's fund is more than 10 times bigger than russia 's , despite russia having x28 the population . 
  norway is on a state level invested in companies outside it 's own territory , and average yearly return alone is bigger than some european countries total budget , 2016 data shows $ 48bn profit which is roughly $ 9600 per norwegian . 
  yes , tickets starts at $ 5 with [ luxexpress ] ( https://luxexpress.eu/fi/tallinna-riika-1 ) , bus goes 11 times a day tallinn - riga . 
  it 's whether you believe a government should act parent for the people or not . 
  in fact you can explain a lot of them with alcohol , but it 's not the only factor and the finnish murders it 's more about location . 
  most of these murders are male middle-aged friends drinking in one of their friends houses . 
  then a dispute arises that gradually grows the tensions for hours and ends with someone stabbing another at 5am . 
  in comparison , the british go to pubs and bars to drink with friends , meaning there are at least a few staffers that control the environment . 
  that 's not the case when you drink at home . 
  there 's nobody sober to give you the lights of throw your sorry ass out if you misbehave . 
  but then again , what right do i have to tell another adult how they can spend their free time ? 
  of course . 
  every bank holds different currencies , but this is for the sake of risk management , not speculation . 
  they alter their holdings based on this risk exposure you speak off . 
  this is n't speculation . 
  these levels are adjusted every day as the risk changes . 
  what i am saying is that under the new regulation commercial banks are n't allowed to trade in pursuit of profit . 
  speculation is n't bad per se , speculation is an important factor in keeping markets liquid . 
  but the reasons banks are now banned from speculating is that it does n't make sense for commercial banks to bear this type of risk whatsoever . 
  this is because the funds they use are from actors with a very high risk aversion , i.e. 
  people and businesses who deposit money on a bank to make sure they can meet short term capital requirements . 
  this is why the banking and trading books have been separated with regulation . 
  it makes much more sense that institutions managing funds raised by actors who prefer a high level of risk in hope of a higher reward should bear this risk instead , i.e. 
  hedge funds . 
  that 's highly unlikely . 
  the rulebook for banks has more or less tripled since the crisis . 
  banks ca n't really hold speculative positions anymore since amendments to the basel ii ( .5 ) regulation right after the crisis and basel iii regulations which is currently being implemented up to 2019 . 
  banks nowadays have to hold quite a bit of capital as safeguard for all the risk they take . 
  banks have to keep their banking and trading books completely separate from each other , so banks ca n't hide speculative positions between these books anymore . 
  it also does n't make any sense that a bank who has recently been undergoing problems and thus in the spotlight would have any chance of hiding a big net speculative position in a currency . 
  in what world is this hypocritical ? 
   ukraine is ignoring the same law for dozens of thousands of its own citizens who enter and leave the country through eastern occupied areas . 
  samoyleva is russia , not ukrainian , they are thus not even under the same laws to begin with . 
  countries enforce different rules for their own because their nationals are their responsibility under international law whether they are harmless tourists or isis terrorists . 
  entering countries is not a matter of equality . 
  i can enter egypt much easier than an eqyptian can enter finland . 
  entering other countries is a privilege , especially if you know they are in conflict , not to mention conflict with your own country . 
  if you take the first flight to teheran today , you 'll have a harder time passing through borders of other countries due to the iranian stamp in your passport . 
  whether you agree with this policy is irrelevant . 
   but suddenly it must be implemented for the russian eurovision contestant . 
  it was already implemented . 
  we 're talking about enforcement . 
  you do n't ignore laws to appear in a different light . 
  you can choose not to pass a law in the first place , but after you 've passed it you can either enforce it or abolish it . 
  not to mention that ignoring this law , or abolishing it , would be very unfair to the thousands who have lost their innocent loved ones in the resulting conflict that is still going on today . 
  ebu inquired in december for ukraine to make special arrangements . 
  ukraine said they would n't . 
  this was well ahead of choosing samoyleva , it was a known risk . 
  i even remember reading this . 
  edit : source to the december inquiry from ebu regarding the ukrainian law : http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7625198/ukraine-eurovision-ban-russian-artists-blacklist . 
  play stupid games , win stupid prices . 
  i do n't buy that he has gone insane . 
  unlike other `` strongman leaders '' , erdogan has never been good at playing in the shadows . 
  erdogans moves are generally perfectly predictable , even if the means can be very surprising . 
  despite erdogan , turkey has n't become worse off . 
  the metrics that matter to the average mustafa have gone up , that 's a fact . 
  turkey has since 2011 had an exceptionally high gdp growth of 7 % / year on average . 
  that 's why people like erdogan . 
  but this exceptional growth trend has quite significantly gone down during 2016 .
