  this means he has known for some time that he wo n't be able to sell the same rate of progress as earlier . 
  how do you sell this change to the people ? 
  - he needs a causal reason to remain in power . 
  the vote erdogan is holding is text-book populism you can read in any history book , i.e. 
  when you have nothing to lose you start grab powers you were unsure whether you could control before . 
  but this needs to be sold to the people , and this is where the causal reason comes in as he will have to justify this . 
  this is why merkels strategy is the best . 
  it 's better to passively lay back and call him out when he says something stupid . 
  showing solidarity with the dutch by silently voting with the wallet is probably the most effective thing anybody can do . 
  what about [ n\u00e4sinneula ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%a4sinneula#/media/file:s%c3%a4rk%c3%a4nniemi_20150804_cropped_n%c3%a4sinneula.jpg ) ? 
  168 metres at the spike and the restaurant is at 135 metres . 
  yes , why not outsource our road patrol too ? 
  the physical mail industry is shrinking so would it not be the perfect opportunity to start gradually shifting away from postal services into policing ? 
  best part : they could use actual post-horns to signal cars to the side of the road .

  not sure if it 's obvious to non-finns : observe the tactical move by the two pricks sitting on the back row . 
  they knew fully well you 'd pick the middle-seat if they both sat at the window seat while you 're getting on the bus so they prepared by squeezing in a seat . 
  then once you 've chosen a seat elsewhere they move back to their respective window seats . 
  i think you 've read the same thing i 've read . 
  that the initial funds allocated to countering the oil crisis will have been used fully in the middle of this year . 
  so if nothing changes from now this means the government will have to allocate more funding , which they still have a lot of . 
  but all funds have a purpose so they 'd have to cut down on something . 
  most notably if they use the sovereign wealth fund , which are usually regarded as reserve funds . 
  but these funds are supposed to be used for securing pensions . 
  the other option is to privatise state owned companies . 
  maybe it 's time to privatise rosneft ? 
  british petroleum already has a 20 % stake in it so there may be interested buyers . 
  russians may not like it , but probably better than cutting pensions . 
  a privatised rosneft would open doors for more competition . 
  i ca n't be only one thinking it does n't make sense that an energy-dependent country like russia does n't invest enough in future sources of energy . 
  china just pledged [ $ 350bn to investments in renewable sources of energy ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-renewables-iduskbn14p06p ) . 
  that 's twice the amount of their defence budget , this will probably up their competitive advantage quite a bit in coming years increasing pressure on everyone else . 
  / r/fingols, 
  unarmed and not a drone but otherwise it has already been done : [ mathias rust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathias_rust ), 
  this is currently the case in some other eu countries too , but all except poland have made plans to eradicate the preferential treament . 
  [ retirement ages ] ( http://www.etk.fi/en/the-pension-system-2/the-pension-system/international-comparison/retirement-ages/ ) . 
  in most eu countries women will not retire earlier than their male counterparts unless they are projected to retire within the next decade or so . 
  since most countries are raising their retirement ages to late 60s , early-70s you 'd think poland would have to follow suit at some point . 
  i think it 's unreasonable to assume anyone born after 1980 will get full-benefits retirement before 70 in the end . 
   democracy does n't work by waiting until it 's 51 % against the status quo so it can be changed mate , this is the point of democracy ... what it should n't be is waiting to pass something with * simple majority * . 
   especially on things that ca n't be changed back . 
  this i think most can agree with . 
  this is easily solved by requiring a special majority instead of simple majority . 
  special majorities can be defined as 2/3rd of the vote where at least 50 % show up , or a simple majority with mandatory voting meaning everyone shows up . 
  this is how the brexit-vote should have been in the first place . 
  simple majority is not a very democratic way to execute a 2-option polls . 
  it makes minority opinion holders more likely to vote giving them more power than their proportion of the population . 
  this is why nobody recognised the crimea referendum since only minority opinion people turned up and the regular people and especially opposition given no incentive to even show up . 
  this is why compulsory voting systems like australia are arguably much better democracies . 
  relevant username . 
   the eu also exists to bring an ever closer political union which some countries did not sign on for . 
  and it 's fine to hold that opinion . 
  but also realise that exiting the union is a tradeoff that means less say in international politics . 
  many people are very fed up with uk politicians lying to their voters and blaming a lot of self-inflicted problems on the eu . 
  take eu immigration . 
  an eu country has the right to kick out a leeching eu immigrant . 
  * the uk never adopted this policy . 
  * take uk influence in eu politics . 
  the uk has always had a more than average say than other countries and up until it started blaming things on the eu it was a example to follow within the eu . 
  why do you think i have a 2 year warranty on my computer ? 
  because the uk had the best consumer rights policies that it got the eu to adopt . 
  take the example mentioned above . 
  the eu has a whole website dedicated to explaining fallacies in eu governance that media has exaggerating . 
  for some strange reason , a country with 15 % of the eu citizens accounts for the majority of these ? 
  british media even went so far as to blame uk alcohol tax on the eu despite how much cheaper beer is in most mainland countries . 
   the agenda of making friends and reaching out a friendly hand , oh yeah that 's terrible , you do n't seem to realize that childish fools are turning away the hand of friendship and cooperation here * the flaw in this `` agenda '' is assuming this has n't been done already . 
  * the eu is the tool to make cooperation easier with countries not on our level of advancement , or differences in legal interpretation . 
  all cooperation is not favourable . 
  here 's why : countries like china and india are hesitant to permanent deals with the west in the same way we did n't like `` lawsuit-gate '' in negotiating ttip with the us . 
  the eu and the us has negotiated extensively , * and failed * , with the same countries `` brexiteers '' say will come running to the uk as soon as it exits the union . 
  in the past these agreements have failed because of the same reason ; so far , as soon as we have mentioned `` copyright '' , `` net neutrality '' or `` consumer rights '' countries like china and india leave the negotiating table right away . 
  it 's true that any country could strike a deal with china and india , but only as long as the three principles `` copyright '' , `` net neutrality '' and `` consumer rights '' * are n't * included . 
  if you sign the fta without these principles an indian company can start marketing an identical software in the uk as a uk company already provides . 
  the difference being that the indian company is subject to indian restrictions which are more lenient . 
  the indian company would instantly have an advantage . 
  why the fuck would you want that ? 
  * the eu exists to give western countries a better position to make sure we can strike a deal in which they adopt our rules . 
  a deal without `` copyright '' , `` net neutrality '' and `` consumer rights '' is simply worse than no deal at all . 
  * so the problem with this `` brexit agenda '' you mention is the assumption that the uk would magically be in a better position at the negotiating table than both the us or eu . 
  india is bigger in all aspects than the uk , except economy where they are pretty similar . 
  why should they bend over for a country less relevant than them ? 
  they did n't even bend over for the us , * the biggest economy on the planet * . 
  the idea that india would agree to taking on uk rules rather than the other way around not just arrogant , it 's stupid . 
  and do you think the uk will be in a better position in negotiating an fta with the us that does n't include `` lawsuit-gate '' that the eu-us fta fell on ? 
  i 'm sorry , but you 'll have to bend over for that one . 
  australia is still a step ahead of them both . 
  canada and mexico have yet to start the second step of the ascension process : becoming a contestant in the eurovision song contest . 
  they wo n't . 
  they have n't stopped other taxes like car taxation , which are illegal in eu-law . 
  finland pays a multi-million `` fine '' every year to the eu for our car tax . 
  it used to be called `` viapori '' in finnish which is a pretty lame translation . 
  the finnish language likes to translate when possible , and often it results in pretty odd naming . 
  your king is * kaarle xvi kustaa * in finnish . 
  the fortress was renamed after we gained our independence . 
  sveaborg is still the correct swedish name for it in finland too . 
   swedish mythology it was finished just 250 years old . 
  it 's a little too recent history to be called `` mythology '' do n't you think ? 
  but i get what you 're saying . 
  they really are . 
  their instincts make them hunt and kill anything that is smaller than themselves regardless of whether they are hungry or not .
