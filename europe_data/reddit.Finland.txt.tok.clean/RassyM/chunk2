  who pays for that mans upkeep ? 
  - again : i do , and so do you . 
  see what i 'm getting here . 
  i think it 's exactly the governments job to find some kind of solution for things that impact us all in the end . 
   the eu has a lot to gain from dragging the us and canada into a cold war with russia this is the most ignorant thing i 've read in a while in this sub ... ** eu is not a federal entity ** , we 're a collection of countries with ** vastly different economical interests ** . 
  heck , russia is the biggest trade parter of my country . 
  it 's quite safe to say that a russian recession means bad business here . 
  it was n't that easy . 
  the mining firm , lone pine resources , had before that spent a ridiculous amount of money on different types of mining permits from the authorities . 
  nafta article 1105 , the article under which they sued the state with , requires a state to grant : `` treatment in accordance with international law , ** including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security ** '' . 
  now , the bill that quebec passed did not meet these standards . 
  it simply revoked all mining licences out of thin air without any kind of compensation agreements towards the firms affected by the decision . 
  you do n't have to be a lawyer to understand who really handled this case wrong . 
  how is it different to this ? 
  let 's say a university tells you that you 've been accepted . 
  you move to the town , settle in and pay all your pre-semester fees . 
  2 days before lectures kicks off you get an email telling you that you 've been expelled because they have , out of thin air , removed the program you 've been accepted to . 
  the university also refuses to hold any talks of how you 'll even get the money you 've already spent back . 
  you now see the problem here ? 
  she was just horrified at the chance that you would strike up a conversation so she would have to use her broken english , 
  have you been living under a rock ? 
  that has n't stopped people from trying ... with varying results : /, 
   but a man being a defence minister that did n't even have the character to do his share speaks lazy ass all the way and you do n't count medical reasons ? 
  why should someone with apparent problems have to stay in the habitat ? 
  because of honor ? 
  people are different , we 're not all rambo ... and because of this fact the person should suffer consequences for the rest of his life ? 
  you should be the person to remind them why they pay taxes ... 
  sounds to me that someone 's just a bit butthurt for having been forced to serve 360 . 
  well , that 's a double standard . 
  if you say you 're okay with having some people who have n't done the service as defence ministers then why should n't others be allowed to ? 
  why the heck should simply having a dick matter here ? 
  haglund is miles better than wallin . 
  but according to you , you 'd still give wallin more credibility simply because he has completed the service , not based on what either of these have done ? 
  wake up , every fourth finnish man does n't complete the service nowadays !, 
  jesus christ ... what 's you opinion on female defence ministers then ? 
  this is about being defence minister , not a fucking lord commander . 
  having done your military service , community service or simply having been sent away for medical reasons should n't matter . 
  what 's important is that this role is held by a civilian . 
  defence ministers elected through meritocracy have a tendency to be highly biased towards the army . 
  they overspend , give unnecessary permissions and cut connection with other ministries . 
  remember , finnish defence relies on 99 % diplomacy , 1 % military . 
  this does n't necessarily mean they would n't pass or that people should avoid them . 
  `` lie '' is an exaggeration . 
  it seems like it 's more like a trick to save money . 
   the euro ncap ( new car assessment programme ) safety tests are funded by various european governments and motoring bodies . 
  funny enough it costs quite a bit to get cars tested and car makes have to sponsor it all . 
  most of those are based on other cars that have passed . 
  it 's not audi uk that does the testing so it 's probably a mistake after all . 
  this statement makes it look like the testings are state-funded . 
  the a5 mentioned in the article is just a sportier version of an a4 which does score 5-stars euro-ncap . 
  the little difference in upper exterior design and having firmer suspension does n't affect it 's body rigidity by much , if at all . 
  both cars have the same safety features as standard . 
  same goes for the a7 , which is based on the a6 ( 5 stars euro-ncap ) and shares the whole platform . 
  it 's a sportier and more luxurios version of the a6 and comes with more safety features as standard . 
  it would definitely pass the 5-star mark . 
  the a8 is the flagship model , if it does n't pass it would be a catastrophe . 
  it comes as standard with far more safety features than any of the models that have been tested . 
  the r8 is a super car based on the lamborghini gallardo platform . 
  it 's probably got the best body rigidity of the the whole lot . 
  that said , super cars are usually not tested as standard cars because they lack a lot of features in order to boost performance . 
   but there is no legal requirement for cars to be euro ncap tested . 
  but safety-tests are required in the usa , and with a lot stricter standards as well . 
  all of these models have passed with great scores . 
   illiterate immigration from third world countries as we have now . 
  we do n't have that . 
   but i do not want any more non eu immigration or immigration that is n't explicitly recruited to a job . 
  then you 'll be glad to find out that we do n't have that either . 
  unless you already can show that you have been accepted to a position/education you simply can not get residency in finland . 
  being american or rwandan makes no difference , your request for residency will be denied . 
  we only accept refugees from the most crisis-ridden countries and regions , and even for this we have very strict policy . 
  this is a reason why we have so many from somalia , currently ranked the worst country to live in . 
  all those allowed to stay have gone through a long process to determine the severity of their situation . 
  there 's no way to simply slip through the system . 
   as we have enough unemployed our selves . 
  but not unemployed with the skills or mindset required . 
  finland actually needs more people to share the burden of paying for a country as big as ours . 
  this has been stated multiple times since the 90s . 
  immigrants do n't `` take '' anyones jobs as they are the most entrepreneurial demographic there is in our country . 
  2.5 % of all businesses in finland are owned by immigrants . 
  that 's a large number compared to them making up about 3 % of our population !, 
  those pizzerias near you probably employ 4-5 people each minimum . 
  same goes for your local department store cleaning contractor and small-time franchises . 
  when was the last time you saw an all - `` finnish '' firm do any of those ? 
  finns have a tendency to not do these types of jobs that require some business-minded effort from your own part . 
  it 's funny because those areas are almost stupendously profitable if you do it right . 
  computer components : http://www.alternate.de/html/index.html pretty much everything is cheaper . 
  can someone post a full list of the banks affected ? 
   in the southern parts both swedes and finns go to germany/poland/estonia instead . 
  finns contribute to [ more than a third ] ( http://www.finlandtimes.fi/business/2014/04/23/6361/finns-buy-one-third-of-estonian-alcohol ) of estonian alcohol sales . 
  it 's inevitable that the unemployment number will rise a bit due to less jobs being available . 
  a large part of unemployment in switzerland is from the market for unskilled labour . 
  in this market the supply of jobs is almost perfectly correlated to the cost of labour . 
  so going by the statement of `` well-being of the weakest members '' can be debated . 
  i would n't say minimum-wagers are a part of the weakest in switzerland , or any other state with a thorough welfare model in place . 
  this because having employment gives you access to a whole bunch of taxation & pension perks and a solid safety net if you were to lose your job . 
  it 's the people who for one reason or another has fallen outside of the system that are the weakest . 
  these are people few want to employ even at current minimum wage . 
  logically a higher minimum wage would further decrease their chances of obtaining employment . 
  if anything you could view this is a way to better the position of the lower middle-class at the cost of the weakest . 
  this is what i think / u/yaovinho implied .
