  you want a ** court ** to be democratically electable ? 
  that 's the stupidest thing i 've heard this week !, 
  judges do not wield any more power than the book in front of them gives them . 
  the task of a justice system is enforcement and that must absolutely not be influenced by politics and elections are just that , choice based in ideology . 
   markets are fundamentally irrational . 
  money markets is the closest you can get to a working efficient markets hypothesis . 
  illiquid markets can be prone to irrational behavior like over - or underreaction . 
  but world currencies , like the gbp , are among the most liquid assets you can trade so it 's extremely unlikely this is the case . 
  markets reflect information about future performance , historic performance is mostly irrelevant in asset pricing . 
  `` brexit business fallout '' is one market risk reflected in the price , `` uncertainty '' is another . 
  in the case of the first one a big chunk of the risk has already been reflected in the price for months . 
  if we can learn anything from today it is that markets seemed to value the added certainty positively higher than it valued the brexit risk that still remained uncertain negatively . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  he was 13 and like other jewish kids he could n't attend school and had to report to the judenrat . 
  this authority sometimes used the kids to deliver deportation slips to other jews . 
  how is that being a nazi collaborator ? 
  what could he have done differently ? 
  what do you think would have happened to his family if he had put up resistance ? 
  ( hint : half a million hungarian jews were executed . ), 
  please , go read a history book !, 
  but snow is mostly dry . 
  at least we can use our phones outside without 10bar water resistance . 
  you mention dairy and industry but the fact is all industry sanctions that can hurt regular people have been were put in place by russia as countersanctions . 
  eu has n't sanctioned any business aside from banking and financing , russian firms seeking finansing in europe as well as sanctions against select influential people in russia . 
  the average ivan not being able to buy european product x is all thanks to his own government . 
  well * chicken kebab * too . 
  those are both funny ways to say * pork d\u00f6ner kebab *  edit : i guess an '' / s '' would have been appropriate . 
  exactly . 
  kinda shows how important the gulf stream is for northern europe . 
  i spent a winter in montreal , and i have to say that i preferred winter there since the sun was up longer . 
  upstate new york is actually the same latitude as the french riviera . 
  you 're right , that alternative might have sailed . 
  but it 's important to make the costs as high as possible now so that russia does n't destabilise other european countries . 
  but there are still occupied areas in ukraine that could be resolved by russia ending its support allowing ukraine to seize them back and restore order . 
   this hinders employment as some citizens would prefer to never work , as they 're guaranteed a certain amount of money . 
  this is what we 're trying to fix with `` basic income '' . 
  there 's currently no incentive for unemployed finns to seek part-time employment because the pay increase over taking benefit is n't high enough . 
  sometimes you even get less for working . 
  the trial would entitle them to money while also taking on lower paid part-time jobs . 
  the basic income you 're implying is something we 've already had for decades . 
   those who refuse to work , do n't deserve to eat . 
  this is something finland and most of the western world has evolved past . 
  having a job is n't about eating , having a roof over your head , or buying healthcare , because ** those are already guaranteed for everyone ** in finland since several decades ago . 
  if you 're dirt poor in finland you can also seek financing for a phone or laptop . 
  having a job in finland is about being able to enjoy the activities and luxuries one wants , e.g. 
  size of house/garden , quality of food products , summer villa , cars , road bike etc. 
   it just makes them look petty and obsessive . 
  not really because it works . 
  it got you the toy in kindergarten , it made you popular in school , it advanced your career . 
  it 's a shitty human trait , but it does work . 
  you 're right but this is a traditional map , i.e. 
  before coca-cola santa . 
  many of those areas in uusimaa were majority swedish-speaking even during big parts of the last century and many remain strongly bilingual today , like porvoo , sipoo , hanko , inkoo , kirkkonummi , kauniainen , loviisa . 
  then you have majority swedish speaking like raasepori . 
  so it 's not really wrong to color them like this , because these areas were swedish speaking before the coca-cola santa . 
  that said , the bilingual phenomena is exclusive to the coast nowadays . 
  take raasepori for an example which is 66 % swedish speaking , and drive 15-20km into the country and depending on where you started and which road you took you 'll arrive in salo or lohja which are 95-99 % finnish speaking . 
  and then in varsinais-suomi drive from turku into the archipelago and you 'll arrive in majority swedish-speaking municipalities ; parainen , kemi\u00f6nsaari . 
  a lot of fenno-swedishness in the southern regions stems from the archipelago and coastal living and that is kind of a sub-culture to the general culture of these regions in a historical sense , even helsinki , espoo and turku which % - wise are n't very swedish-speaking today . 
  like in `` leverl\u00e5da '' if you 've ever tasted , but with just potatoes . 
  we usually eat these `` laatikko '' - type casseroles in finland around christmas time . 
  we also have carrot-casserole , liver-casserole , swede-casserole ( as in rutabaga ) , sweetpotato casserole . 
  they all end with - l\u00e5da in finnish swedish , but really they are like swedish '' - pudding '' . 
  people simply like to talk shit . 
  they get the best outcome if they bully the outsider behind his back instead of someone from their own audience . 
  it 's considered '' fun banter '' until the outsider happens to hear it . 
  i do n't think this is something that 's exclusive to this subreddit , it 's just how human beings operate . 
  are you sure this is n't just a culture difference ? 
  in big parts of europe you can criticize other countries policies without offending people . 
  we kinda take pride in insulting politicians and policies , even if we voted for them ourselves . 
  however , when traveling to the us and canada , we 're explicitly told to not do this , because it 's not viewed as good manners kind of in the same way you would n't insult your dinner host 's furniture . 
  and i think this goes both ways , i do n't think 6th_samurai would have been downvoted if he had a european flag to his name . 
  kinda `` when in rome , do as the romans '' attitude . 
  i do n't know if i 'm explaining this any good , i do n't think this is any different to how americans have banter between individual states . 
  we 're just not taking precautions here on / r/europe when we 're not expecting to be in the company of someone who might get offended . 
  it 's kinda why you 'd find more criticism of us policies here than elsewhere on reddit . 
  i say just ignore it , few are actually trying to be mean , most people probably just try to be funny . 
  about 40 % of redditors are american , so it 's kind of a given . 
  i think it 's a good thing that we connect despite the distance . 
  foreigners visiting this sub also keeps the circlejerk in check . 
  british economy was not in the shit before brexit . 
  gdp growth had been above expectation for the last 4 years . 
  unemployment was going down too . 
  but yeah , why would they care about what the experts have to say ? 
  but not traditionally pro-russian . 
  to be traditionally pro-russian means to be for increasing economic development in trade with russia . 
  lots of politicians are pro-russian in this regard . 
  the belief that better ties would spur economical development in russia which in return would drive them away from the aggressive politics . 
  this is n't controversial at all . 
  finland has tried to be `` pro-russian '' in this regard . 
  however , fillon has even openly justified the invasion of ukrainian sovereign territory by rebels and russian forces . 
  that 's controversial and radical no matter your political leanings . 
  it 's [ ppp ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cxcfy570jdk/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  shit 's expensive , yo . 
  but latency will obviously show up as a little higher than a network cable , but i have n't noticed it showing up as worse than maybe 10ms more . 
  i 'm over 50gb for this month . 
  in addition to using it as data on my phone i use it as a wifi-dongle for my laptop . 
  my lte plan is kind of my main internet . 
  it 's kinda the reason why i got lte in the first place . 
  it 's not choppy at all and latency is fine , when plugged into the computer it does n't have a noticeably worse connection even when doing some gaming versus a regular wlan connection .
