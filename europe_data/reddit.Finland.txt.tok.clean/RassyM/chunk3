   as ukraine stares into the abyss , where is europe 's leadership ? 
  busy trying to stabilize the situation . 
  not trying so hard to be loud is probably the most effective way forward right now . 
  whether you see the current leadership in kyiv as legitimate or not , new elections for no doubt legitimate leadership are set for roughly 1 month from now , it 's time to start focusing on that . 
  additional note : 80 % of russian crude oil goes to eurasia , the eu countries being the most prominent importers . 
  that 's \u2248 35 % of the russian gdp coming straight from europe . 
  yes , but banks are all international in one way or another . 
  you can not sanction a russian bank and expect only russian victims . 
  historically foreign sanctions against regular people rarely ends well . 
  `` we 're imposing sanctions on `` bank abc '' because our fellow citizen `` def '' has assets and shares in said bank . '', 
  or `` we 're imposing sanctions in `` bank abc '' because we speculate that fishy trades have taken place . '', 
  try explaining that to the populace who have their life-savings in that bank . 
  a sanctioning move against a billionaire would have very little effect compared to all collateral damage it would result in . 
  no billionaire has their assets in only one basket . 
  all banks are like this , if we impose sanctions because of the clients and trade that happen in these banks , then dutch and english banks should have to go as well . 
  regular people would be the real victims here . 
  timchenko holds finnish citizenship , as do the rotenbergs . 
  eu can not sanction one of it 's own citizens . 
  last conscription in ukraine was set for autumn 2013 , so it was about to be abolished . 
  here 's one : http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/15/ivan-kashinsky-photography-roma-buzescu this is n't the one i originally read , and is much shorter , but it supports my statement . 
  the projects were approved . 
  the roma who acted as demolitioners were n't given the factories or the land , they were simply given the job to tear down the factories because nobody else would . 
  they made a good chunk of money shipping the scrap elsewhere . 
  that 's still how the industry works , however today you 're usually paid to do the job at a price . 
  but back then there were no resources to do so . 
  the cofferts were empty so giving the scrap was the only way to get someone to do it . 
  again . 
  the metal was n't stolen , the tear-downs were given away by the state because someone had to do it . 
  letting factories just rust and fall is bad for the environment and would have made the lots unusable in the future . 
  the state did n't have the resources to coordinate the project so it was given away . 
  the landlot still belonged to the state . 
  do n't always assume the worst ... 
   the tear-downs were given away . 
  do you understand that sentence ? 
  they did n't steal anything . 
  the tear-down of the factories were literally given away/sold cheap because the state did n't have resources to do anything productive with it . 
  and how many russian oligarchs today did n't do the same ? 
  the fall of the soviet union was a golden opportunity . 
  the factories were long abandoned , rusting and useless . 
  the tear-downs were given away because there was no power in place that would do it otherwise . 
  it 's debatable in reflection , but legal at the time . 
  for those saying this is money from organized crime : i 've read this story several years in a row now , it seems to pop up every couple of months even here on reddit . 
  i recall that the rich roma of buzescu , along with many other roma clans , ** got rich completely legitimately ** selling scrap metal from abandoned factories after the fall of the soviet union , netting several billions in todays worth combined . 
  people need to realize that roma are n't one group of people , they are a collection of hundreds of clans across europe all having their own culture traits . 
  the majority are n't beggars or traffickers !, 
   but the snow is n't left on the roads for the winter in cities snow goes away if it has n't snowed in a while , but even then the road is too icy enough for the majority of those who bike to abstain . 
  however , bicycle lanes , even in helsinki , are covered with snow all through december-march , depending on weather obviously . 
  it 's even worse in smaller towns . 
   they also continue so through the year . 
  some , the grand majority switches to public transport or car . 
  that is true but it still does n't add up , remember that we 're talking about bicycling as a primary form of transport , not people who occasionally take the bike to work or the store . 
  even in helsinki bicycle lanes are poorly coordinated compared to having lived in the netherlands . 
  unless your office happens to be situated on the right side of helsinki , or in the centre , you would be suicidal if you took your bike , cars will simply not give you room . 
  not to mention that there is n't a public parking system , you 're lucky if a building has a parking rack for more than 5 bikes . 
  again , i 'm not doubting that they have reached this conclusion , i 'm just saying that there 's something legitimately fishy here i.e. 
  they have forgotten to take all factors into consideration . 
  i need to dispute the relevance of this poll . 
  there 's absolutely ** no chance ** in reality that finland scores this high being the sparsest country in the eu , not to mention the 4 months of snow . 
  this could hold true if they had only asked people living here in the capital region , which they probably did ... 
  the problem is not that we simply do n't have the resources to create a common stance on things . 
  the european way is to go to the un before doing anything , as opposed of the us taking an aggressive stance from the beginning . 
  the last thing we need is to develop a bad relationship , or even a frontier , between the eu and russia . 
  russia is a significant trade partner with the eu . 
  namecalling is counter-productive if you hope for any diplomatic talks to succeed . 
  most toyota supra mk4 : s in europe are japanese imports , so they are rhd anyways . 
  lhd supras can cost up to 2-3x more due to rarity . 
  i calculated that it would be cheaper to commute from a family sized apartment in central tallinn to helsinki with a small personal helicopter ( robinson r22 ) than to buy a similar family sized apartment in central helsinki . 
  helsinki is in a housing bubble . 
  the french rate is 15.5 % social security and 19 % `` real '' capital gains tax for a total of 34.5 % , so it 's already . 
  previously as a non-resident you only had to pay the 19 % but hollande changed that . 
  you do n't circumvent taxes , you circumvent income tax . 
  income tax is progressive and is determined based on the amount you earn . 
  capital gains is flat whether you earn $ 1000 or $ 10m . 
  in france capital gains is 34.5 % . 
  in france investment income capital gains can be taxed at source at the rate of only 24 % . 
  this only applies to executives who exceed $ 1m in money earned from a `` salary '' or a `` wage '' . 
  these are not the `` rich guys '' that will bring in a lot of tax revenue . 
  the real rich guys earn their money from capital gains , which is n't covered by this tax . 
  and when talking about executives , companies can just start paying them in stock and financial securities/derivatives and the executives too will be exempt . 
  i also thought it sounded good at first . 
  however , there 's usually a `` but '' to fast-track `` solutions '' like these . 
  let me explain why this is a solution on the expenditure of how much we value citizenship , essentially an instant depreciation of your freedom as well : citizenship is not only a mere passport that gives you rights to travel the lands as a citizen , it 's also means the country has an obligation in the eyes of other countries to take full responsibility for you . 
  by revoking citizenship a country does n't just renounce said persons right to citizenship , the country also forces another country to take responsibility for these people . 
  this is why we have statements of temporary vs permanent ** recidency ** in the first place . 
  the whole deal with these is that they are statements you can revoke because they are n't a foreign contact , it 's strictly a domestic agreement . 
  when people start revoking the higher standard you actually downgrade/deprecate the value of citizenship to `` residency '' status . 
  so what should be done ? 
  do not take on people , aka responsibility , you can not handle in the first place . 
  do n't accepct people you have doubts about or at least stand up for the responsibility you accepted . 
  if it was as easy as just deporting all criminals over the english channel then it would already have been implemented . 
  is it a possibility that they will ban reddit ? 
  because there sure is content even i would call disturbing on here . 
  i think we can agree that those are valid points . 
  however , we are talking about children . 
  can a child take a decision like this ? 
  because the last problems we want a terminal ill child to experience are those adding more mental stress and pressure with a matter they can not fully comprehend yet . 
  e.g how do you tell a child that this is a possibility ? 
  because many sure wo n't even know that the term `` euthanasia '' really exists , let alone that it is an option for them . 
  children are labeled children because they are n't rational people , yet . 
  a child is not going to consider all his/her options independently like you and i do , a child asks for input from other people .
