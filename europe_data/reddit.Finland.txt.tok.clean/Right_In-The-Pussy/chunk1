id really still like to be a relativist in this case , but someone in russia has made it really hard for me . 
  yea well now you are just to conclusions like schoolyard bully as well . 
  winter just started , afaik many people unaware of this get drunk , slip and fall this time of year , of course that is just one possibility out of 1000 but hey * it must be puttler because evil * the media has made people into their own personal hate mob these says between the vilification of all muslims and soon all russians too by the looks of it, 
  wow , for once i can say good guy turkey . 
  thanks for inadvertently looking out for out interests of the eu people when out governments do n't listen or involve us in their trade deals, 
  sometimes i wonder do people in this sub even realize the monsters they have become where one person ca n't factually point out how people here tend to automatically jump to conclusions of foul play without being labeled as a traitor/shill/pos over it . 
  this is how nazis become nazis . 
  no no , they did n't say those things , it was `` an impersonator '', 
  yes, 
   it was strictly because of eu dealing with ukraine . 
  yes i have noticed the eu is getting a bit expansionist as well lately and frankly i do n't agree , ukraine is either a slave to rusisa or a slave to the imf `` the west '' either way i 'd rather if both sides left them alone, 
  yes i condemn any interventionist foreign policy . 
  i live in europe and the fact the `` west '' has been chest beating this whole thing that should be left between russia and ukraine to figure out themselves pisses me off . 
  too many idiots reading tabloid newspapers like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yqwizj6.png ) are now also being manipulated into supporting an `` us vs them '' mentality as regards russia while i just want us to keep our heads down and not take any sides in the matter . 
  why ca n't you just respect m opinion instead of resorting to ad hominems and calling me a `` shill '' you read way too into it and frankly seem a little bit obsessed with me, 
  no i 'm speaking as someone who does n't necessarily agree with the idea of states and borders . 
  the fact you keep thinking a few pixel image means my perspective might be somehow different is just a bonus . 
  would you support fifa if they were to stop recognizing palestine as part of israel ? 
  it 's pretty much the same thing, 
  no they should not . 
  sport is sport and should not be mixed with politics . 
  plus it can work both ways  coming to berlin and adolf hitler viewed it as a golden opportunity to showcase his country and prove to the rest of the world that his aryan race was superior . 
  not so fast , adolf . 
   twenty-two-year-old american jesse owens did n't care much for hitler 's politics -- or any politics for that matter . 
  he just wanted to show off his immense skills and represent his country to the best of his abilities . 
  just over a year earlier , on may 25 , 1935 , owens recorded one of the more mind-boggling performances in track and field history . 
  he broke three world records and tied another at the big ten track and field championships in michigan -- in just 45 minutes !, 
   hitler viewed african-americans as inferior and chastised the united states for stooping to use these `` non-humans . '', 
  despite the endless racial epithets and the constant presence of the red and black swastika , owens made hitler eat his words with four gold medals . 
  what are you the flair police . 
  look crimea is a part of russia now therefore not showing it as part of russia would be the political statement . 
  how do you know where my ip us at this point in time , not that it 's a requirement for a specific flair anyway ? 
  politics should not into football . 
  they are right to do this, 
  i mean euthanasia in that old people should be allowed to end their lives when they see fit and not killing them just because ...  the key word is ` impending ' . 
  it 's coming , but it 's not here yet , i still think it 's pretty disingenuous and a slap in the face to the young europeans who are unemployed that this generation who are in power keep importing more immigrants when they ca n't provide jobs for their own kids, 
   not necessarily bad , but in our cases it is . 
  someone should have told them baby boomers to have more kids then !, 
  i mean they say we need immigration for some impending age crisis while all the time youth unemployment is like 25 % such hypocrites , we should bring in euthanasia instead of immigrants and see how they like that, 
   however , you have to learn to separate fact from fiction . 
  on an issue like this , they will use statistics out of context and sensationalise . 
  when you say stuff like that you should really back it up with evidence . 
  i 've watched it and ca n't see where it 's sensationalist, 
  so are you saying the bbc is misleading us with this documentary or the facts presented are somehow misleading ? 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nqcbm please do explain because i always thought they were good trustworthy media, 
  documentary : [ britain 's hidden hungry ( full episode ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iskvboyfou ) educate yourself, 
   i am specifically avoiding a mortgage right now due to housing deflation here ( a mess of factors , but monetary policy is a big one ) . 
  same here but i read 0 % rates and current monetary policy as well ... desperate to say the least . 
  if banks need to try that hard to get me buying something is fundamentally wrong imo, 
  i totally agree with what you say but what i said was in reference to you saying  inflation ** helps ** those with debt nobody should need help with their debt and it is certainly not within the mandate of a central bank to interfere in that way . 
  if someone or an institution have taken on too many debts that 's their fault and not the place for central banks to interfere . 
  * couch cough . . 2008 crisis *  a smart society should allow for caluclated risks , and particularly home ownership as it allows many more people to have significant assets in the long term . 
  again i totally agree and i think debt is also great for helping price discovery since nobody will borrow money to buy something if they do n't think it 's good value . 
  but here is the problem ... how can you have true price discovery with zero percent interest rates , it totally distorted markets and this is totally evident now in the us stock market bubble , banks are borrowing money at zero percent and straight up pumping it into things they think will go higher . 
  if i borrow the money at 0 % interest it takes away too much of the risk, 
   inflation helps those with debt . 
  those with cash savings are hurt by inflation , but by investing those savings it can come out ahead . 
  i try to a responsible citizen , not get myself into too much debt and i try to save and make my money work , why am i being punished for being a responsible investor and not getting myself into a situation where i need help with debt . 
  the whole system is screwed if it 's tilted to help gamblers who bought property years ago for an inflated price, 
  i think you know that 's not true because the more wealthy you are the more you make your money work for you . 
  the less money you have the more inflation affects you . 
  if you need proof of this just look at the fact the 1 % has gotten richer . 
  does n't stop retards down-voting me because i 'm not a fan of modern neo liberalism and the rich getting richer for some reason though . 
  yea on a broad scale of things i agree . 
  everything has a habit of finding equilibrium , i just get bugged out about banks re-inflating a property bubble to erase their previous betting losses . 
  sweden looks like a textbook example of an overheated property market right now and i 'm just not a fan of cheap interest rates to keep the party going . 
  if there is going to be a correction you have to let it happen otherwise first time buyers like me will keep renting until they get it anyway . 
   have a look at table 24 . 
  swedish workers have been enjoying rising wages . 
  i believe the same is true for germany , e.g. 
  the train conductors union striked multiple times to enforce a 5 % increase in wages that data seems to be 10 years old but luckily the recent data does reinforce your point http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/wages germany and sweden i think may be one of the few exceptions in the euro-zone i think you will admit ? 
  ok , i also did n't have the figures for the rest of the year . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/inflation-cpi if i add it up it 's -1.6 % on the year to date which would mean a $ 558.54 on the same purchase . 
  if there was a magic number i would say it 's 2 % so perhaps this was needed, 
   a ) it enables government spending on loan so basically inflating their debts away then ? 
  hint : bondholders and lenders tend to not like when country 's do that and charge higher interest rates as a result . 
   you can offset the increase in peoples salary , making them feel better about their job at zero cost so are wages in sweden rising with inflation , i do n't live there but as regards the eurozone i know the answer is a flat no meaning people are being robbed of their wealth via inflation, 
   but would you buy a car if you knew you could get it 5 % cheaper next year ? 
  why say 5 % and deliberately move the goalposts ? 
  afaik , 0.25 % was the deflation rate in sweden up until now so now let me ask you this question , knowing europe 's most popular car the vw golf is $ 34,900 new in germany would you wait one year to save $ 87.25 assuming current deflation of 0.25 % persists and at max $ 174.50 should it double in the near term ? 
  i 'm willing to bet you would not , but please do give me your opinion . 
  anyway the reason most people forget about saving the $ 87.25 is because they want the shiny new car now before everyone else has one . 
  i agree deflation rates of 5 % are bad but this is not a problem right now and should not be looked at as a problem . 
  you are also forgetting the fact car prices typically fall anyway as a particular model gets nearer to being replaced by a new one . 
   are you going to buy real estate when you know that you can get a much better deal if you wait a bit ? 
  no but that 's how markets are , they go up and they go down but price alone should not the biggest factor in making that decision . 
  if you ca n't weather a 10 % drop in property prices you should not be buying a house in the first place anyway by your logic everyone should buy houses now as the price can never be allowed to fall due to how bad deflation will be ? 
  there is also the fact more people rent in sweden than are home owners so this would benefit more people than disadvantage . 
  and if you my personal opinion sweden is in the middle of a property bubble which has only been further fueled by cheap credit . 
  if i was a thinking about buying a house in sweden lower prices as a result of natural market forces is exactly what i would be waiting for . 
  * y u need to manipulate property prices even more with cheap rates central bank *, 
  consumers may opt to postpone demand if they expect prices to fall further in the future . 
  if they do , they might find prices are ** 5 or 10 % cheaper in 6 months ** . 
  i think deflation has a long way to go before we get to * bad * levels, 
  i agree with your basic premise but that only becomes true with a decent deflation rate . 
  like i said , any normal person wo n't wait a year to buy something 0.5 % cheaper and this is proven by the technology market , i bought an ssd drive for my computer last year knowing i could get much more for my money now but fact is i wanted it then and not in a years time . 
  this is a phony argument which i 've heard before and pretty much debunk in my other reply in this thread but even if what yo say is true it does n't even work that way in practice right now . 
  if what you say is true why would anyone ever buy a led tv when they know the price will be lower next month/year . 
  fact is people buy things when they want them  what you really want is an increase in the general wage rate yes and any government that tries to push inflation without at least an equal overall rise in wages is doing a disservice to their countrymen . 
   because people spending less as prices will be lower in the future i do n't know about you but when i go to buy a liter of milk for $ 1 i 'm not thinking `` maybe i 'll wait for two years for when it might be $ 0.99 thanks to this sweet 0.5 % deflation rate .
