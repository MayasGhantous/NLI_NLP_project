  fuck it , i 'm going to get the popcorn . 
  op how do you feel about this ? 
  [ it 's your vote !, 
  use it !, 
  ] ( http://www.downsyndrome.ie/campaigns-and-projects/my-opinion-my-vote/its-your-vote-use-it/ )  all people aged 18 years and over have the right to vote including people with down syndrome !, 
  if you are going to ask such a controversial question i think you should have to at least define how you describe `` basic knowledge of politics '' otherwise you are just applying heat to popcorn material . 
  also you are making a bit of a precedent that could go further , many more might then argue pensioners should not be allowed to vote as like children many are dependents of the state and it 's well known mental capacity decreases somewhat as we age . 
  just so it 's known i disagree with the entire idea becasue it would just become another form of gerrymandering . 
   they would have given it back oh another person who has n't read the article i see . 
  if you had you would know it was bought by a wealthy russian businessman on the open market in order to be returned to tsipras try having the fact 's next time you try and act the smart-ass, 
  i mean this game of denying obvious nazi symbolism . 
  i can take the argument `` there really is n't as many as russian media makes out '' but to say . 
  that 's just some old symbol with nothing at all to do with fascism is just nuts, 
  good question  in theory i 'm against the banning of any symbolism or speech since in my opinion it only fetishize 's said banned symbols and so i guess i 'm not in favor of it . 
  i 'm more curious to see how selectively it will be enforced though and thats where my real issue will no doubt lie . 
  i sure will hope so or it will be the height of hypocrisy and i will have created precedent that they ca n't then ban my snazzy new logo either , 
  true that but there is no reason a large bureaucracy is any more democratic than 70 's / 80 's soviet union . 
  both run the economy in a command and control fashion , just look at the selective bailing out of the baking industry , qe , rejection of the south stream pipeline and all these other major policys that have nothing to do with democracy of capitalism but decided by an elite that `` this is whats best '', 
   wolfsangel-typish thingy ? 
  oh ffs , are you really going to play this game ? 
   run by the extremist patriot of ukraine organisation , which considers jews and other minorities `` sub-human '' and calls for a white , christian crusade against them , it sports three nazi symbols on its insignia : a modified wolf 's hook , a black sun ( or `` hakensonne '' ) and the title black corps , which was used by the waffen ss . 
  [ does this not look familiar to you ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uv3xfu6.png ) or then am i free to just invert a hammer and sickle image , call it a `` cutting-ma-jigger '' and say it has nothing to do with soviet union but at the same time we agree with most everything they did and stood for ? 
  edit : check out my new and totally not communist symbol , lets seem them try and ban the [ `` cutting-ma-jigger '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qrkhd1d.png ), 
   it bans all symbols and propaganda representing `` the totalitarian communist and nazi regimes '' so i assume [ if i see any of these ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/azov_batallion_shoulder_patch.png ) on peoples clothing i should call the police then ? 
   it bans all symbols and propaganda representing '' ** the totalitarian ** communist and nazi regimes '' then to define * actual * communism  ** communism ** ( from latin communis -- common , universal ) is a socioeconomic system structured upon the ** common ownership ** of the means of production and ** characterized by the absence of social classes , money , and the state ** ; as well as a social , political and economic ideology and movement that aims to establish this social order . 
  so i assume all information , discussion and organizations relating to real communism is fine then ? 
   the reason is quite obvious : centralization of power leads to a dictatorship . 
  yet here we are saying the eu is the best thing ever if you believe most people on this sub, 
  just out of curiosity can you tell me a party that is n't partly responsible either for the mess or doing nothing about it for the past seven years but same old , same old ? 
  discounting the finns and pirateparty  nearly everyone has had a go at this stage have they not and the financial crisis and recession is/was not isolated to finland . 
  i will probably vote keskusta as i 'm getting a bit sick of how left alliance is turning too much into the sjw party instead of proper socialist policy and keskusta seem to care more about putting the country first without being radical anti eu . 
  wo n't this mean an unexpected payday for the russian sovereign wealth fund as all those rubles they bought when it was 70 to the dollar are now worth more ? 
  also lol at the downvotes, 
  if i recall correctly greece was not included in the qe program so while ireland , spain , portugal and co have seen their bond rates intentionally suppressed to 1 % - 2 % levels they have no benefited from the project at all . 
  thanks for the sources , that 's genuinely interesting info which in the context of todays politics comes across quite toxic but not altogether unsurprising given the geopolitical situation at the time . 
  lets not forget world powers fund politics in neighboring countries all the time , to this day you have the national endowment for democracy , an us state funded ngo giving money to political groups and opposition in countries where they wish to expand their influence all the time . 
  i 'll never get sick of debating with people who give out about the policy of `` finlandization '' with flimsy moral arguments when the soviet union was at the height of it 's power at that time and there was absolutely no way they could accept a 100 % pro western govnerment right alongside one of their longest borders . 
  you are free to be bitter about it 's legacy but in terms of realpolitk there was no other option unless you wanted to see finland become the ukraine of those times . 
  playing both sides provided tremendous economic benefit at that time , the alternative was to become a fronter country with the soviet union playing economic and military hardball instead of political softball or is there really a better and more credible alternative thesis . 
  like i said specific examples about them accepting favors . . wikipedia is neither accurate nor specific not that it paints him and the center party in a bad light either . 
   although controversial , his policy of neutrality allowed trade with both the communist and western blocs . 
  the bilateral trade policy with the soviet union was lucrative for many finnish businesses . 
  his term saw a period of extremely high sustained economic growth and increasing integration with the west . 
  he negotiated entrance into efta and thus was an early beginner for finnish participation in european integration , which later culminated in full membership in the eu and the euro . 
  he remained highly popular during his term , even though such a profile approached that of a personality cult towards the end of his term . 
  he is still popular among many of his contemporaries , particularly in his own centre party . 
  much controversy surrounds the interpretation of his policy . 
  seriously cutting trade when a country is on the verge of recession is one of the stupidest things ever . 
  thanks stub , if only that could become a thing, 
   i 'm not surprised . 
  keskusta ( center party ) has a reputation for bowing to russia for favors . 
  i translate that as `` they are realistic about our geographic situation and who our biggest single import export partners are '' or can you give me an example of such favors and i 'll gladly change my words . 
  it 's not that i do n't think kids have to pull their weight but they do seem to to a lot more spoiled and pampered or maybe i 'm just getting old . 
  thing is different cultures always have different reasons to have kids . 
  perhaps if we just got rid of state pensions in the first place and had more of an asian culture where kids are expected to look after their parents thus having kids is essential to retirement it might encourage a lot more couples to have them, 
  when you print money and give it to banks with the sole intention of covering up the holes in their balance sheets and maintain their rent seeking lifestyle it tends to not trickle down into the real economy , except when they pay someone to wash their new porsche but that 's about it . 
  having kids these days just seems like a huge financial burden . 
  it 's not considered acceptable to do what nearly every society on earth has always done and use kids as extra sources of labour anymore . 
  when my parents had me it was kind of expected i could be put to use on our farm and parenting meant washing my dirty clothes , feeding me and making sure i came home before dark . 
  we were n't anyways poor but when i was n't at school i worked at home all summer to earn money for something like a nes or in the promise we would have a good holiday . 
  i still have a hate of weeding and digging potatoes but i can totally understand my parents logic and i guess it made having me in the first place worthwhile . 
  if i could have a kid keep the house clean , walk the dog , maybe even do some simple data input jobs on freelancer.com it would totally make the idea of having kids more palatable but somehow i do n't think that 's cool anymore . 
  thank god someone said that so i do n't have to . 
  haha this always makes me laugh , goldman sachs cook the books and it 's only greece 's fault . 
  then ceo of goldman sachs mario draghi gets promoted to head of the ecb on the basis of his record while greece gets to become a debt colony, 
  i think we ai n't going to agree here so maybe best to just leave it , for example . 
   basic income creates an illusion that an individual has earned the money , he and she has n't , it was earned and then paid by others , so i will call it as automatic social benefit i would say unemployment benefit as it stands gives an individual the impression they are simply a net drain on society and until they are working again they are worthless . 
  people in my view should be allowed to do charity work and engage in the community when unemployed but currently you are not allowed becasue it constitutes not `` being available for work '' forcing people to sit at home and take a handouts for it is n't good for the soul medium or long term either . 
  it 's pretty hard to argue the mental illness side of things since you are correct in saying it was n't diagnosed like it is today but at the same time even though i am only a youngster i can see people have become much less social , maintain much less real connections and overall shut themselves out more . 
  i try to quit the whole social media thing but then that makes me the outsider as society has decided that 's what they do now . 
  to me facebook is a recipe for depression and mental illness , all you have is people posting polaroid and idealized versions of their own lives that usually do n't match reality . 
  i have a gf who is borderline baby mad now becasue of all the cute pictures girls of her age group are posting yet at the same time she has n't gone to see any of them or change any shitty nappies in person . 
  that 's just an anecdotal example but i think it 's pretty commonplace too . 
  anyway i just hope something will change in the next year or two that solidifys society as a whole as the last govnerment that did nothing but trudge along was pretty representative of where finland is right now as a society and that needs to change and hopefully for the better, 
  mass invasion of peoples privacy has nothing to do with any `` security vs freedom '' argument, 
   they had many chances that 's your problem right there , nice `` us vs them '' attitude you have let the media foster inside of you . 
  ironic that you just posted : `` what about the poles , baltic people , ukrainians ? '', 
  right above that statement, 
   nope most woman are taller than me . 
  but do they really discriminate ? , as someone 180cm who loves tall women maybe i should move . 
   for many years , the u.s. population was the tallest in the world . 
  in the 18th century , american men were 5 to 8 centimeters taller than those in the netherlands . 
  today , americans are the fattest ah haha , it seems gravity has finally taken it 's merciless toll on mericans or will they blame the mexicans ? 
   whats that whiff in the air i detect ? 
  our friends from savushkina 55 maybe ? 
  is reddit already that important ? 
   paranoia perhaps ? 
  i will always upvote common sense and countries looking out for their peoples best interests , no matter who the partner greece is a ` natural ' natural gas hub for both russia and moreso the mid east connections . 
  ignoring that is just outright bad economics . 
  of course it will be very had to make any of what i just said happen if we ca n't tackle tax avoidance at an eu level . 
  what i ca n't understand still is why there is so little will to do anything about it . 
  i 'm not a ps voter of course but i sure do understand why they exist and those votes are the protest votes of the working poor people who are struggling and want change . 
  my wasted piraattipuolue vote will fall into the same category but on the left sphere of things . 
  damm thats an amazingly well informed site . 
  i knew there was something way to in depth about that business insider article as well . 
  i wonder did they buy it or steal it now . 
  it was late last night when i thought that through and you are 100 % correct . 
  the rich are paying most of the taxes in finland right now but the super rich are not and that 's where states are hemorrhaging money worldwide . 
  since we are now open to globalisation and the good and bad that comes with it this problem needs to be brought to the forefront of every g20 , davos , world economic forum and such conferences  the political dialog is dead .
