  the fact people accept crying `` whataboutism '' as a valid retort just goes to show how far american cultural propaganda has permeated . 
  any time i see someone write that i know it 's becasue they have no valid argument to present or they would have used it . 
  yes it does , it represents the dumbest and fastest breeding segment of your population which is what makes it all the more dangerous . 
  except for the fact american dominance of europe is the one thing that rustles the jimmies of other countries , all they want is confrontation on other countries soil, 
  it sure makes the german/banker argument easy to understand . 
  however understanding one side is not the same as understanding the current situation . 
  more cynical people might even call it propaganda, 
   how is iceland doing this well in the first place ? 
  to be honest i put it down to good old fashioned nordic solidarity among a homogeneous people . 
  this is why i always say society is the most important resource a country has . 
  cheap for helsinki or anywhere in finland for that matter , $ 5 would be more common in city centre . 
  apparently it 's at least common . 
  i could n't believe it either until my gf brought it up as a threat to be more careful . 
  haha yea , i guess that 's what you could call it, 
  wtf , you pee sitting down and now this sweden you just got better in my book, 
  holy shit that reminds me of my old place in helsinki but over twice the price and no windows ( assuming no good real estate agent would take the picture at night ) small apartments can be cool and looking back it was probably one of my favorites but it should be a crime to charge that much and not have a bunk bead with sofa and tv underneath . 
  mine also came with the view of a `` massage parlor '' and $ 2.50 beers downstairs in the bohemian part of the city so got to have friends round to pre-drink and play `` guess the creepy dude who goes inside '', 
  my rent is entirely reasonable compared to london $ 800/mo for 80m2 shared between two, 
  i was talking about european qe and do n't worry american qe will be back as soon as they think up a suitable excuse . 
  they literally ca n't raise interest rate or wall street will explode . 
  i 'm going to go with `` the dollar is too strong and it 's harming the economy '' as the excuse this time, 
  european banks do n't like to give people dollar accounts ever since bnp paribas got fined million for allowing some clients move money to iran and therefore going around sanctions . 
  apparently if you use uncle sams currency you need to no nsa level surveillance on your customers first , well you do n't have to but by being total dicks that 's the message the us sent to the banking system here . 
   unlike the u.s. , the euro people have to import almost everything especially their energy and their economies are heavily reliant on exports while that is true one thing the eurozone has going for it in comparison to the us is we actually have a positive balance of trade so in theory we should be exporting even more now since they just got more competitive . 
  no matter how bad things get we ca n't really have a balance of payment crisis , ( our main imports are energy and raw materials but we export even more machinery and vehicles ) the us on the other hand is just a consumer economy that needs to import far more than it produces . 
  dat recovery , `` any day now '' since 2008 . 
  oh an do n't underestimate the inflation , the * stated * point of this whole adventure in qe is to cause inflation , raise prices and so make the economy look like its growing but in reality they are just trying to inflate away debt . 
   a man who is tired of london is tired of life or claustrophobic and does n't like to live in a shoebox if not earning seven figures, 
  eh next to nothing is manufactured in the us , one of your top exports is scrap metal ... to china ... for * them * to make stuff with it . 
  go check your balance of trade figures , you only import stuff . 
  yea but the economy did n't get better it simply got * cheaper * while anyone with savings are assets in eur just took the hit . 
  economics like you describe it is a zero sum game , by devaluing the currency somebody else 's currency just increased vs the euro . 
  now if some european company just perfected a revolutionary new robotic manufacturing technique or we all started working more productively you could say the economy got * better *, 
   following news that they had passed the fed 's tests , several large us banks announced share buybacks - signalling long-anticipated paydays for investors . 
  this makes me sick , banks using qe money to buy their own shares just to pump the prices so they can give themselves a payday . 
  congratulations guys we 're literally just giving them our money and people think this is ok ? 
  so the question nobody can answer , what happens when interest rates inevitably rise and it 's no longer feasible for banks and corporations to loan money to inflate their own stock price and the wider stock market ? 
  this is the reason why the s&p , djis and german stock markets are making record highs and not the phony economic recovery the news talk about . 
  [ finnish people are easy to spot too ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yvq2ncc.jpg ), 
  give it time , right now their economy is a black hole with no end in sight . 
  put it this way , would you invest your money there ? 
  fist time i 've been impressed with a european policy initiative in a while , naturally it would have to be just one guy and not the eu making sense . 
   if it goes for revival of economy in turn everyone wins since storng neighbourood economy means stronger your economy i agree but try and make this argument towards greece and watch the downvotes flow . 
  as bad as greece may be , it 's nowhere near as corrupt as ukraine . 
   the game of monopoly was originally designed to demonstrate the dangers of capitalism . 
  [ 1 ] that 's what i was trying to say , capitalism = monopoly, 
  i just hope they demand some form of collateral like we did with the greek loans because rhetoric aside i would n't be happy with my state making such poor investment decisions . 
  capitalism without a rigid system of wealth transfers like inheritance tax , capital gains tax and corporation tax will always end up like a game of monopoly as the person with the most will accumulate more and at a faster rate . 
  the conservative government in britain just decided the public can have all the chance cards while banking and cooperations gets the community chest . 
   the sooner you realise that anti-sjw is a re-branding of the far-right the better . 
  i do n't agree , i am a socialist but i see unchecked immigration a threat to community bonds and something that can only be done with the approval of everyone in the community . 
  right now it 's being forced on a european population who do n't seem to want it and it 's backfiring for the same reason . 
  so yea i 'm a active socialist with cautious views toward multiculturalism , the same goes with some gender equality , some `` feminazis '' are no more than adult adolescents , i do n't care if it makes me a male chauvinist pig , i will still tell my female friends i think it 's not safe for them to walk in certain areas late at night as a woman and some of them will continue to disagree as if becoming a martyr themselves will somehow stop the fact women get raped more than men . 
  sure as a guy you might be more likely to just get beaten up but that does n't come with so many mental scars . 
  anyway sjw 's i often see as idealists with no idea how to make society move to where they want so therefore their views are n't really worth much . 
  you make a good point as regards the center party , it 's not always an issue but i 've always weighed up their specific european stance when thinking about my support for them . 
   yes , the eu is less democratic , because the eu is based on intergovernmental agreements , and is an intergovernmental cooperation , meaning the member governments have a say on it 's structures . 
  one reason for this is because many governments are skeptical of deeper european integration , which means they want to hold on to governmental representation and power on the eu and not give power to eu institutions ( namely the parliament ) independent of national government . 
  also true but then how does this adapt to an eu that is increasing it 's power and influence in future , i have n't seem much initiative to make the eu more democratic . 
  many would say having control over monetary policy is the biggest power and institution can have but yet the average european has little to no say in how that is shaped . 
  i guess the thing that bugs me is if we were to elect a european council of ministers more directly it would be certainly be more varied cabinet than the one appointed by national governments since the dominant national party would n't have the final say , rather it would be the public, 
   well everything they are showing and saing in this video is actually 100 % ** glorious true ukraine facts ** . 
  there is no propaganda like in most russian videos . 
  ** / s ** ** ftfy **, 
  where did you get those figures as the imf figures as presented by wikipedia disagree . 
  poland = $ 23,650 russia = $ 24,110 http://i.imgur.com/etaaqbe.png sauce : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
   did you not follow the finnish national elections in 2011 ? 
  the euro crisis was one of the main topics of the elections . 
  it was the big issue everywhere at the time but in general national elections are not really won or lost on european issues , just look at the focus of the elections now , it 's mainly debt , spending cuts , reform and unemployment , parties view on the eu wo n't be deciding votes i think . 
   at this moment the parties & ministers representing finland in the council of ministers are from the coalition party , social democrats , christian democrats and swedish party , because those parties are in the finnish government as a result of the finnish parliament elections . 
  yes thats how it works in finland but in countries where you do n't have such big multi party coalitions winner takes all when it comes to the council of ministers . 
  the annoying thing is i would like to vote directly for who controls europe and not the parliament that observes and votes on what they decide , no matter what way it 's framed the eu is less democratic than the nation states it supersedes and that 's a fact . 
  i would n't be happy if someone told me whoever wins in local elections will appoint ministers to the national govnerment but you can still elect a parliament to vote on their decisions so why should i be happy with the same policy at european level . 
   by voting for a party member in the national government you say that he represents you . 
  so he also represents you when he appoints a minister in the council . 
  it 's the abstraction of power thats the problem , who i voted for in national elections does n't represent me but who i voted for in eu elections does . 
  you might say that 's just the luck of the draw but people do n't vote for national politicians based on their european politics or ideology so it 's not democratic when them same representatives nominate a european commission that holds all the power in the eu . 
  national elections are not fought on eu issues so why should the winning party get to decide what direction the eu takes ? 
  the ttip debate reflects this perfectly , it was made by an unelected council of ministers and not supported only recently by a majority of the european parliament . 
  it 's anecdotal but it supports my point that the commission is made up of unelected bureaucrats that do n't have popular support or mandate of the european people . 
   council of ministers , elected by national governments for that to be democratic you have to assume national governments act in the interest of all their voters , by and large i do n't believe they do anymore . 
  th appointments i have observed by and large serve the political party appointing them and the majority of people do n't care enough about some eu position to get worked up about it . 
  maybe you can call it `` tyranny by apathy '' or something but i do n't call it democratic . 
  as undemocratic as ever i see ... but good graph, 
  to me this has all the hallmarks of a [ vladislav surkov operation . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/wcy8uljrhpm?t=24s ) nobody really knows whats going on , opposition politicians are scared regardless as various seeds of doubt and conspiracy run through the halls of the kremlin . 
  when people are confused or unsure what to believe when faced with many equally plausible truths they will side with stability and control , i.e putin . 
  dan knows his shit , wish more people in ukraine knew english and listened to sensible voices like his, 
  you keep saying that but what have you to back it up ? 
  now if i was to call you a ukrainian shill ( which i do n't stoop so low as to do ) i at least have proof you posted fake pictures and claimed them as you own . . unless you want to tell me how that 's not true . 
  you must be 16 right as i ca n't figure out how you can be so childish and , well , just plain wrong while spending all say acting as a propagandist yourself . 
  at least if my country was being invaded by russia i would fight instead of posting propaganda on reddit all day but i guess you are just some kid so i will give you a break and hope you grow up one day . 
   ok , first , this was not today . 
  thanks for appearing in this thread captain logical , i thought everyone has lost their minds and falling for / u/walt _ ua typical brand of propaganda posting . 
  i have already called this guy on his bs once ( as i have archived here / r/rocketgate ) and got my message and everything related deleted by the moderators here who are only too happy to let his propaganda be ... . well , propagated . 
  i ca n't be bothered to go down that road again right now as these idiots seem to have endless time on their hands to spam this crap , just look at the guys post history , ( anti russia , pro ukraine , all day every day . . guess the guy has no job or life or military to join thank you for showing me not everyone is incapable of thinking critically as i 'm truly losing hope for the world if people can be tricked into believing ukrainian propaganda so easily and i 'll bet the same people who fell for this will think they are so far above `` falling for russian propaganda '' well sorry but you just got duped . 
  just pointing out since this guy has taken claim for pictures that were not his own in the past, 
  i feel sorry for you , you insist on saying that yet you are the one who is a total liar and proven propagandist and you can not even back up a single claim of your own / r/rocketgate so tell me oh so glorious and correct walt , why have you not answered my few simple questions so i can eat my hat . 
  you are letting all of reddit down with your tardiness, 
  that is actually not from today and featured in this article on sunday http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11444036/more-than-6000-killed-in-merciless-devastation-in-ukraine-says-un.html,
