   the most ironic thing about rising inequality is how completely unnecessary and self-defeating it is . 
  if we do something about it , if we adjust our policies in the way that , say , franklin d. roosevelt did during the great depression -- so that we help the 99 percent and preempt the revolutionaries and crazies , the ones with the pitchforks -- that will be the best thing possible for us rich folks , too . 
  it 's not just that we 'll escape with our lives ; it 's that we 'll most certainly get even richer .

  give me a break and maybe even educate yourself a little, 
   conspiracy driven crap explain what is conspiracy driven crap ? 
  as far as i have read this trade deal and ttip both allow private companies the ability to sue governments and also prevents states taking back controlling stakes in companies that been privatized . 
  good to see i 'm not the only one picking up on this guy who thinks he knows better than everyone else http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gaokk/europeancanadian_free_trade_agreement_ceta_leaked/ckhwkyb, 
   there 's not much point asking the public , most of them are uneducated morons that do n't have much of relevance to say . 
  i always had a feeling you were a pompous elitist so and so but now i know . 
  you go on here as an australian talking about democracy and european values but you are no better than that neo con * cu * t * you put in power there who does n't believe in serving the electorate who put there there in the first place . 
  sadly out eu representatives are on the lobbyist gravy train too and do n't give a shit about the people who put there there, 
  yea i just note how you seem to not consider any alternative result possible . 
  ** ideal ** ditch the euro and split europe into north and south eu trade and immigration zones and let everyone work out problems their own way . 
  ** realistically ** anything but the status quo would be fine , preferably with no ttip, 
  well he 's exactly a peoples pm but rather a rich orange faced swede . 
  i ca n't stand him just by the look of him, 
  8 days '' / u/specofdust is a bit too confident of a no vote in scotland so will come back to rub it in '', 
  number of paid holidays ? 
  / maternity leave ? 
  i 've not lived in the usa because i 'm more of a work to live than a live to work type of guy . 
  i have no doubt as a guy in my late 20 's with a msc in computer science i could get a pretty ok job without much experience do you think ? 
  downfall of living in the states you can do pretty well when you are in your 20 's and can take the chance on not having healthcare/pension plans due to the fact you are young but i would not give up my irish passport for anything, 
  so you are educated on it but why do you really think it 's right when trade unions/activists and practically everyone but negotiators and governments have come out against the deal ? 
  look at what the biggest trade union in the uk and ireland has to say about it ... http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/referendum-campaign-must-wake-up-to-nhs-trade-deal-threat/ one question and something i 'm admittedly unsure about , every member state of the eu must ratify it in their own parliaments if the european parliament approves it but do you know will country 's like ireland and the nederlands need to vote in a referendum as they have in many key eu decisions because i can thankfully never see this passing a popular vote . 
  so i guess you consider yourself part of the enlightened 1 % who understands this treaty and who 's views are more important to impose on the masses because they are just and righteous . 
  nice to hear you have such a high opinion of yourself . 
  when considering this treaty i only had once main question among many , will this treaty enhance or degrade state sovereignty in the face of what i now see an on over-burdensome eu ? 
  the answer for all accounts appears to be a clear no with enhanced powers to private corporations the intended result so do n't agree . 
  do i `` know what they 're talking about with respect to the ttip '' or is it just my humble opinion does n't matter to the 1 % who actually `` understand '' this ? 
  hows that labour market participation rate ? 
  jut because people gave up looking for work does n't mean they are not unemployed . 
  the quality of `` jobs '' in the usa , ( where three seems to be the average required to run an average household these days ) is not exactly the best either . 
  thanks but no thanks, 
  that 's not it either . 
  unless you 're a conspiracy theorist , that is . 
  i ca n't take anyone who uses that excuse seriously , explain why one would have to be a `` conspiracy theorist '' to think ttip was never to benefit citizens ? 
  from what i gather it 's a commonly held belief , are you saying a large section of the population are what you refer to as a `` conspiracy theorist '' ... inferring a negative connotation from what i gather, 
  and just look at it now ... no thanks, 
  so you think acta/sopa/pipa were bad legislation then ? 
  finally some truths , or trew 's as russell brand would say, 
  and worst thing is they are actively recruiting much more kids right now on the banner of patriotism, 
  i 'm proposing a commonwealth of scotland and ireland . 
  and by that i mean all the best whiskeys now belong to us . 
  let 's see england bargain with those chips against old bro 's united, 
  you sound butthurt already which as an irish person makes me very happy considering how we had to struggle with your `` democracy '' for 800 years, 
  and without including the piss poor eastern eu members ? 
  i would like to see the same thing with say just the 12 state eu, 
  good link and interesting but a bit of a poor showing on the obvious genocide question since ireland was a net exporter of food during the famine  there was a belief that the potato blight , which caused the irish potato famine , was an opportunity to reform and change irish agriculture . 
  they also felt that by clearing away surplus population , a smaller , more prosperous class of farmers could be securely employed in the agricultural industry . 
  with this viewpoint , the british government felt that too much relief would only draw out the inevitable for all concerned . 
  well if that 's the only critique you have of what i wrote i 'll take it as a good thing . 
  now that i think about it you might be right , we would probably have eugenics in no time, 
  i think corruption in elected rep 's is worse though . 
  have you heard the term liquid democracy ? 
  it 's a huge area but to put it in a few sentences i can * choose * to give my say/vote to someone else ( lets say someone who does it full time , like a moderator here ) but importantly i can also take it back at any time . 
  it 's not much different to the tyranny of the masses we have now ( or at least allude to having ) but rather power that can be withdrawn at anytime . 
  if you do the right thing more people will back you in the long term . 
  you have to admit election cycles create pressure for short term plans . 
  if i was in the uk right now i would straight away give my vote to richard dawkins or stephen fry ( or in turn whoever they have assigned his vote to ) in the world we live in it 's much easier to judge their character than a guy who turns up on your doorstep once every 6 years and pretty much lies and says everything he can to make you believe they are better than the other guy you do n't know because i know these people represent the same beliefs as me and i trust them therefore i ca n't complain when they screw up . 
  edit : the swiss pretty much have a good model going which most importantly keeps everyone happy because they feel like they are heard at a very local level, 
  or you know we could just try something new using modern technology to get rid of elected representitives who can be corrupted and go with direct democracy, 
   but seriously saving becomes incredibly stupid in this environment . 
  keeping money in hard assets and commoditys is always a safe place to store saving . 
  i do n't see how spreading savings across a basket of commoditys such as goil/oil/wheat futures could ever be a bad thing since if the economy turns down gold will rise and oil will fall and opposite is true in a boom . 
  in any case they are not making more of these things but money can be printed non stop . 
  i 'm a saver ( and gold buyer ) as i think these low rates are untimately going to fuck up the whole global economy . 
  so conversely , low rates are encourageing me to save and not spend and i 'm sure many more are in the same bracket after 2008,

  good one, 
  what do you define as `` liberalism '' the french chicks i slept with in the past i would describe as very liberal . 
  please be a revolution , please be a revolution , please let there be a revolution, 
  my comment was nothing to do with nothern ireland and more about the fact ireland and scotland have a shared gaelic heritage and shared history of resentment toward the english . 
  ireland won their freedom and now i hope scotland can too, 
  i totally agree , it all depends on how stubborn they want to be about it now . 
  todays vice dispatch really showed the ukrainian troops as down and out with no morale and no heavy weapons left . 
  so then why all the fuss and sanctions if they clearly want to be part of russia ? 
  well it 's easy for that dude to talk tough all the way from britain, 
  because the west would rather you did n't think russia has any claim to crimea, 
  come on scotland , do it for ireland, 
  no , you must be confusing me with / u/right _ in_the_pussy, 
  sorry but the eu does not `` owe '' anything to ukraine since remember the eu and usa had nothing to do with the revolution right ? 
   are you saying that us should not help ~ ~ when ~ ~ ** if ** russia attacks finland ? 
  ftfy, 
  ok so you ignore all the inevitable failures of the western system i pointed out and focus on the one chinese one . 
  what makes you think china wont offer euthanasia for elderly people who do n't want to be a burden on their children . 
  now i hoped i would n't have to ask you to address my points about the fact the western system is built like a ponzi where more people are always required at the population base to keep it going but yet we cant have infinite people in the world but would be nice if you did n't ignore this time, 
  sounds like a loaded question but i 'll bite . 
  countries who do not keep to the rules regarding defect spending and national debts would be a prime target so there 's greece and perhaps spain/portugal as well . 
  i would also include some of the less developed countries like romania/bulgaria who are a net drag on the finances of the eu at a time where there is n't the money to support them . 
  oh and add uk to the list as well as they only seem to be in the eu for trolling value and to make sure they do n't do anything too much against their interests, 
  about minus 50 % in my opinion, 
  contributing to your allies implies supporting their military endeavors . 
  as someone who is anti war i 'm glad ireland is neutral and hope it remains that way . 
  on the topic of russo/eire relations i will give some credit to the russians regarding ireland . 
   on 21 january 1919 , sinn f\u00e9in mps ( who became known as teachta d\u00e1la , tds ) refusing to sit in the british house of commons at westminster , assembled in dublin and formed a single chamber irish parliament called d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ( assembly of ireland ) . 
  it affirmed the creation of an irish republic and passed a declaration of independence , calling itself saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann in irish . 
  although it was accepted by the overwhelming majority of irish people , ** only soviet russia recognised the irish republic internationally ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_free_state, 
  i have my own different but equally unpopular opinion that i 'll post again here but all in all i do n't see the risk/reward in this for europe either . 
  it seems like russia will be happy to keep us fixing this mess for another decade instead of actually recovering from the 2008 crash like we could be  on the macro scale of things the usa and europe are now supporting the new ukranian government through direct loans , non leathal aid and the imf ( yes the imf is basically majority backed by anglosphere countrys i hope we do n't need to debate this ) so that satisfies my deination of imperialism in that they are taking them into the fold and ukraine must follow the terms of the imf .
