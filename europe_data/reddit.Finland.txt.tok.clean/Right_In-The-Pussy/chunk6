   now about russian imperialism , i do n't want or endorse it but i also do not want to live in a world where there is only one dominent force as that means everyone is free to be taken advantage of by those at the top of the food chain since there is no alternative or competing system of governance . 
   i believe a multipolar world is important because when you look at history the common worker had a much better standard of living in the 70 's 80 's when the world was split between communism and capatilism because at that time the west was aftaid of the spread of communist ideals and so the lower classes were better looked after in society and real money was spent building a great society rather than hoarding it at the top . 
  ( after ww2 just look at how europe was rebuilt and made great again because otherwise it would be russia right now )  since the fall of the soviet union , western wealth has been moving faster and faster into the hands of the 1 % and western workers have seen their relative standard of living decline . 
   i have no doubt if and when there emerges a proper threat to western dominance more wealth will have to trickle down to keep everyone happy or else there will be revolution either of which i would be happy with . 
   i have no desire to ever live in or under russia and do n't think it 's a great country or anything but my own selfish interests of wanting to see greater wealth distrubution in the west say russia stiring things up in ukraine means the likelyhood of a new occupy movement or similar springing up in the west is all the more likely and therefore it suits my interests . 
   yea i know it 's selfish but as someone who thinks europe/usa badly needs it 's own midan protest war in ukraine suits just fine . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  ireland already defends itself by being a good guy of history and not invading or starting wars with anyone and making good alcohol . 
  plus the whole being an island between the us and usa means your pretty much safe anyway unless full blown ww3 happens, 
   it seems like it 's a move aimed at politically aligning themselves with nato in a manner that does n't get the public upset . 
  because respecting the will of the public is the most important thing right ? 
  right now the public in these countrys does not want nato membership so that 's the matter in a nutshell and it wont change hopefully until real opinion changes, 
   i know some people have argued that they 're not neutral , but rather are nonaligned , but let 's not kid ourselves : sweden and finland are western countries and have their fates tied to the us/eu/nato . 
  please do n't be so american telling other countrys what they are and what they 're not . 
  fact is most finns and swedes do n't want membership of nato and their is their governments enforcing their will as much as possible against the will of the majority, 
  ok so you seriously think we can keep this population pyramid where there is one old person on the top and three young people below ? 
  a one child policy keeps a very good population balance which is what humans need if we hope to survive another century . 
  your idea works up until that point where there is too many people on this planet and we are already very near that point now so * it * is the model that is unsustainable . 
  sure it must suck to have to look after a parent and a child but in most cultures granparents are a free childminder when the adult works or at least that 's how i was raised, 
  yea but my point is china thinks about the problem that is too many people in one place , sure immigration solves americas problem for now but what about when all the population base cant be widened anymore which is a certainty at some point . 
  china 's solution is n't without it 's problems but its sustainable and i 'm sure you have a lot more healthy babies born since if a kid has a detectable illness like downs syndrome they will be more likely to abort and try again . 
  ok so it 's just fine for them to act above the law and threaten the few people who do have oversight on them is it ? 
   the top manager in iraq of the notorious private security firm blackwater threatened to kill a us state department investigator for probing the company 's performance , the new york times reported monday . 
   the lead state department investigator , jean richter , warned in the memo dated august 31 , 2007 , that little oversight of the company , which had a $ 1 billion contract to protect us diplomats , had created `` an environment full of liability and negligence . '', 
   blackwater guards `` saw themselves as above the law , '' richter wrote . 
  damm you auto-correct !!!!, 
  china : we have a population problem : 1 child each please . 
  western democracy : lets keep importing people to keep 3 % gdp growth and keep the dream everyone can have a pension alive as long as possible even though we know it 's a huge ponzi and no such thing as infinite new people forever . 
  sorry but i 'm sick of politicians appealing to the lowest common detonator ( old people who vote ) let the top scientists rule the direction of the country and be done with it, 
  funny thing is china is currently showing where democracy fails in many aspect and that 's in taking decisive action . 
  they are making the change to nuclear and solar at record pace while the west is being bogged by one think tank funded study saying another is crap over and over so nothing get done in the end . 
  of course i would hate to have my freedoms taken away but in a perfect world we would all just join the state that matches closest with our personal ideology and contribute toward their common goals than be left stuck in states we do n't agree with . 
  if they are breaking eu rules than sure those rule violations should be addressed but all the rest of the article is just democracy good , strong leader bad crap . 
  there is no benefit to joining so why join . 
  if anything russia has more economic growth potential than the eu markets so why burn it all over something that is more provocative than anything else, 
  i do n't see the problem , sounds more like the eu saying `` do it our way or no way '' even socrates said a good king is better than an average democracy, 
   i 've read the theories on what works and what does n't , and i 've been trying to educate people on / r/europe [ 1 ] for months about why it 's the best option , to little success . 
  so i can pretty much say you are acting as a pro-ttip lobbyist . 
  i would n't be surprized if you applied for that propaganda money the us embassy in germany was offering to people who will promote the treaty . 
  anyway judging by the amount of comments in this thread you seem to know a lot about a deal ( you admit yourself ) is not released yet . 
  i was always told when there is money backing one side , it 's probably the side that favors big money and that 's all i need to know about thid treaty and the sooner we stick it back up the usa 's genetically modified asshole the better, 
   why do people think academi/blackwater is so nefarious and powerful ? 
  well they are on record for saying if they want they can kill the us president so i think that makes them pretty powerful, 
  wow , the american red threat propaganda sure has got to you if you think every person who does n't support the west on the internet is somehow paid to post their opinion . 
  it must be such to be brought up to believe america is the best place ever and then find out not everyone agrees . 
  funny thing is my comment about riding the missile shirtless was as clear a joke as you can get and you just go off on some rant about me . 
  the days of american glut and riding the money train or free are over and me merica bashing until the day i die ,, 
  no , no we do n't, 
  wow you could n't even be more wrong if you tried, 
  yea we voted no to niece and lisbon but each time the government pretty much said `` you uninformed people did n't really now what you were voting for , lets do it again but with more pr money on the yes campaign this time '' ' if there is to be any eu fiscal union that will need another vote and i know/hope it will be a firm no although the government is hoping it wont be needed . 
  time will tell but the vote is at least one thing we still have in ireland at least, 
   i actually have no problem with ireland 's policy on neutrality , but you guys joined a union that has a mutual aid clause . 
  no the economic union we joined grew up to have a mutual aid clause and ireland was told it 's neutrality would not be disputed . 
  on your second point i totally agree , the eu has become something it was n't meant to be, 
  yea the uk sure is like little america in the warmongering department , cough , iraq , cough, 
  damm right ireland should not be doing anything , our policy suffering at the hands of the eu once again, 
   putin shot down a planefull of eu citizens yea i heard he personally rode the missile to be sure it stayed on target up until 10k feet and rode back to russia in a wingsuit ... all while holding his breath ... shirtless give me a break and go learn some realpolitk, 
  because libya was straight up neo-colonialism and in way ukraine is too . 
  and only two right sector in that one ... 
   yep . 
  complete and utterly despicable capitulation and lack of leadership from germany . 
  pathetic . 
  they 're the premier economy and de facto leader of the eu . 
  fucking act like it . 
  what an oxymoron , by not starting fights with your neighbors is how you get to be no 1 . 
  germany ( eu ) / russia partnership would offer way more prosperity to the eu than this botched usa thing and they corporate ttip crap . 
  i want our day of state ownership and no privatization back, 
  haha ha , one reporters opinion piece now counts as european opinion . 
  when back in the real world germany is panic buying imports and exports to russia are down . 
  http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-25/russian-sanctions-costs-german-exports-russia-collapse-risk-50000-jobs funny thing is germany would be much better off dumping the usa and become closer to russia since russia can offer mineral and cheap gas which usa can not . 
  anyway i wont get in the way of your shilling of / r/europe, 
  crony capitalism : not even once !, 
  assuming i am `` trying something '' you should get out more , not everyone on the internet has an agenda that goes against you, 
  pr for starters since i see your jimmies clearly rustled, 
  oh please, 
  yes lets all get our news from glorious ukraine today . 
  thank poroshenko for this wonderful news source that will tell us russian nazi only lie and shoot themselves with own madpad all day . 
  no civilian die from ukraine ever, 
  lol so being realistic about their actual immigration statistics and where that leads them if they keep the current numbers makes me a fascist now ? 
  to be a fascist would imply i actually give a toss and if really was a fascist i 'd probably be happy with what sweden is doing as it will soon become an example of why taking in millions of uneducated emigrants from war torn country 's is not a good idea . 
   not that ecuador literally is american territory , just that it could be in a matter of hours . 
  well it took them over two years and they sill cant get through one embassy in london, 
  well duh , , palestine . 
  i think israeli 's was the word you were looking for there rather than just blanket `` jews '', 
   because ~ ~ we now ~ ~ ** some fuckers called shell ** have gas , a lot of gas for sale ** which we benefit zero from ** ftfy, 
  quite the opposite really , european have no appetite to take further hits in the pocket after nearly a decade of austerity and declining standards . 
  on the other hand russian people have the real hardship from the 90 's fresh in mind and in comparison have seen things improve over the last decade and will take a small decline on the chin . 
  we can already see this considering russian sanctions have been much easier than european ones but yet it 's putin who has the popularity . 
  in the long run it 's even worse for europe as country 's like greece will give the finger to sanctions and start to consider their own best interest , europe is too divided to ever make sanctions work, 
  does that include the cuban prison refugees who kept piling into florida and sent the crime stats rocketing, 
  it 's only because you are always spamming threads here defending sweden 's self genocide immigration policy . 
  do n't worry i did n't actually read whatever excuse you had for it this time, 
  totally the best kind of people you could ever accept / s, 
  yea it 's great but the usual thing for people i know is they work in helsinki because they have to , either because they work in some expert area and the jobs are there or they are born there an just fine it too expensive now, 
  not really , i live in the second biggest city in finland and get twice as much space in a city center apartment for the same price . 
  not nice at all is an overstatement but you get half the amount of property there for your money compared to the rest of finland and in general it ' a very expensive place to live if you do n't earn near or over 2 per month . 
  when you are the type of person the economist appeals to and money does n't matter than yea it 's not a bad place to be . 
  for the normal person it 's not nice at all anymore, 
  so on mondays you trash russia and on tuesdays you defend the police all day . 
  i 'm even more convinced you 're a shill now .
