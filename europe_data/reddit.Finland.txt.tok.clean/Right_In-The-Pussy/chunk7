  it 's pretty easy to train a bot to remove copy/paste comments once you build them into a database but hey that 's not my job . 
  you would make a good point had i actually discussed the russia situation once in the past week or two . 
   waiting a week to post a comment or two before getting banned so we are banning people who show any support for the russian argument now are we or is it just people who only post about one issue ? 
  where do you draw the line ,, 
  did n't think you would have the balls to respond to me after being unable or unwilling to answer any of my concerns about your own post history and it 's motives detailed [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/rocketgate/comments/2wacdn/i_will_eat_a_hat/ ) but yea , if any of your trolling comrades from the ukrainian troll factory ( http://i-army.org/ ) want social media coaching my going rate for groups and seminars is $ 75/hr, 
  / r/rocketgate i suggest you ask the mods why they deleted by post concerning it and refuse to answer any questions as to why i 'm being shut up, 
   i 'm sorry but there 's really no reason to allow new users to post here seeing how the accounts are abused for essentially propaganda . 
  what good will make people wait a week do though ? 
  people will just setup a spare account to use in a weeks time or just make them in advance , my point being the only people you are inconveniencing ore the casual users , a person with an agenda will jump through as many hoops as you ask ,, 
  then you are just banning new users and anyway the whole new account/shill thing is just testament to how amateur their attempts to spam ( if they is what they are doing ) are professionals buy a few thousand accounts in bulk from a social media sweatshop in india ( yea these places exist ) and let them age like a fine wine , ) so if anything you will just make them improve their methods . 
  also with the way moderators hand out bans for nothing here i 'm not surprised there are many new arrivals, 
  ca n't say but like someone else said on the physical side dilates the blood vessels ( hence the red eyes and glaucoma relief ) , decreases overall blood pressure but increases blood flow throughout the body while if i recall correctly caffeine increases blood pressure . 
  so in a way they kinda may actually cancel each other out on the physical side but depending on what type of weed you just smoked you may still be mentally buzzed . 
  tbh i do n't know as getting hepped up on energy drinks sounds like a waste of good weed which is supposed t relax one in my view . 
   you said the treaty would be irrevocable and as an example you are using the uk threatening to , well , revoke its participation in the eu ? 
  yes revoking their participation in the eu so as to get out of a treaty . 
  pretty extreme and a bit more difficult than just passing a law do n't you think ? 
  that 's the nature of these things once a government signs up to them in theory they ca n't go back on them , the only way out would be to leave the eu altogether and i do n't really think that 's a good move either . 
  or is this just a game of semantics we are playing because if you want to learn what a traty is i suggest you just go to the wikipedia page for example and learn about these things there, 
  that 's not how `` treaties '' work hence the whole confuffle about the uk wanting to get out of the treaties it committed to in the eu about free movement but the other nations say no so they say they will leave instead . 
  basically breaking a treaty is just as frowned upon as credit default, 
  same shit different sandwitch though is it not ? 
  tpp is what bloodsnezes article was referring to as well, 
  [ this is me ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/297/9unwm.jpg ) you might be interested to know k market dropped the eurosaver brand , maybe they still have the energy drinks thugh, 
   wait , is n't battery finnish ? 
  yep , such is the finnish way . 
  when estonian beer is in fact nicer i do n't get why people buy the finnish stuff but yea going to estonia to buy finnish products is our thing so just let us have it please, 
  http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/27/corporations-paid-us-senators-fast-track-tpp i guess someone got a better bribe , this was five days ago, 
   why is it irrevocable ? 
  ca n't be changed or rolled back once passed . 
   well , they ( stubb ) are a right wing party . . 
  so are most party 's here but only that stand for the sort of right wing economic policy 's of trade liberalization and privitization  i heard that they were going for a basic income experiment , was i wrong ? 
  there will be a trial i believe , the new pm was the original proponent of it so i wo n't rule it out . 
  really , i thought they pushed a second vote in the congress there for approve the fast track past and so now it 's only going to be a yes/no vote which will of course be phrased like you hate the economy if you do n't pass it . 
  i can see how the us might be trade treaty weary after nafta though, 
  from what i seen splifs mainly although vaping is becoming very popular and even trendy . 
  i 've been pleasantly surprised to find those huge volcano vapes with the bag being brought out and passed around at many house parties in recent years . 
  depends on the circles you hang in but for sure with the prices here pure joints , not even once, 
  headaches and irritability yes , some people also say it 's hard to focus . 
  for sure most people are better off without it and will sleep better with more uniform energy levels throughout the day with less peaks and troughs but i just like my morning coffee too much although i started a no caffeine after 18:00 rule to help my sleep . 
  i think ttip as it stands is the biggest threat to national sovereignty of our generation , maybe you think i 'm being dramatic but i really do n't . 
   my problem is the impact a basic income could have on keeping a society competitive and , at the same time , in harmony . 
  many people are n't that enthousiastic about providing for people they do n't feel very connected with . 
  i do n't know how it is in the netherlands but here there is kind of a universal acceptance that some people with long term behavioral , mental or addiction issues will never find work and keeping them on benefits is a much better alternative than having them commit crimes and generally be a further nuisance in that way . 
  i guess you could call the growing acceptance and support for basic income a kind of a `` calling a spade a spade '' it sure is a split in policy from countries like the uk that are now talking about forcing people into community work projects and so on . 
  it 's my personal view that if it will work anywhere it will work here , in this other report i linked today about youth opinion and culture there is still the strong belief among young people that life is about finding work and your role in society above all else and i do think people here have a good work ethic and mentality that just because we have our base needs covered we should lay back and take it easy  `` young people 's values are still as conservative as before , '' says researcher of youth attitudes sami myllyniemi . 
  data from the annual youth barometer survey shows that the majority of 19-year-olds still think that work , home and making a living are the most important things in life , especially students in vocational college . 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/survey_-_finnish_teens_ditch_beer_and_smoking_in_favour_of_energy_drinks_and_cannabis/8021722 if it cuts down on bureaucracy and does n't add any more to the social spending budget for sure i can see it being a good thing especially when one of the core ideas of the social state here is to never leave someone with nothing so in a way it exists already in the form of the basic unemployment payment . 
  caffeine withdrawal is an understated bitch, 
  it is but now it will probably be implemented in some other backwater town with all the findings showing that it does n't work . 
  i do n't mean to be a negative nancy about it but basic income just does n't fit the world view of kokoomus and if they control the purse it will be setup to fail . 
  i believe in basic income but i also believe it take a basic level of educated and motivated people to make it work which to be blunt has probably left many smaller municipality 's . 
  with kokoomus in finance it 's dead imo , that was the only thing i thought maybe just maybe we could try out and lead the world in doing something new but i have no hope now . 
  mixed opinion here regarding the cuts and economic reforms but i just ca n't believe they managed to expressly state they will ratify ttip in their 12 point plan they came out with a while back and nobody has really said anything or expressed much opinion about it . 
  the lack of debate and media coverage regarding an irrevocable treaty that the public is n't even being engaged on is borderline depressing in my view and now these guys will just pass it saying `` we told you we were doing this '' added to that the fact keskusta chose ncp over sdp to join the coalition and then gave the key finance position to the same neo conservative hit man stubb just reinforced the fact this government does n't even want to try and fight the right wing economics that have taken over europe and instead they will just roll with it . 
  sure the cuts are n't the worst but the ideological direction that man wants to go in just does n't work for me , less workers rights and zero hours contracts for all within five years instead of the prospect of maybe even cutting bureaucracy and some hope of even a basic income direction . 
  yea i 'd say weed and energy drinks is a good way to bring on an anxiety attack for the inexperienced . 
  that said those rockstar + juice drinks are are a great way to kill cotton mouth and avoid the lethargy of smoking at the same time . 
  damm maybe i should be moving this to / r/trees now, 
  i for one approve this message . 
  are you satisfied that they have expressly stated ratifying ttip is one of their goals in government ? 
  that is the end of debate on the matter as far as we the citizens are concerned , just waiting for the `` we told you we were doing this in our mandate , why did n't anyone disagree '' line to appear when people do get angry . 
   the guys english is ... horrible . 
  i beg to disagree , it 's better than most and in no ways a hindrance to getting his point across [ bbc hardtalk - timo soini - leader , the finns party - 20.2.2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyj5ojkmukc ) the only think i do hate is that we have a neo-con running the economy and they have expressly put `` we will ratify ttip '' in their plan for government . 
  spoken like a true disinformation agent , 
  ordinary russians still see close to nothing of those revenues , as they settle in pockets of putin 's kleptocratic gang . 
  yet living standards , disposable and every other metric have increased exponentially under putins rule but lets just ignore the facts and figures  no , he has not . 
  he is capitalizing on processes started in nineties actually the privatizations and much more were rolled back , oligarchs cane under watch of the state and not the other way around . 
   so , barbarian king he is , is n't he ? 
  again stupid emotional argument ignoring popular support . 
  like i said i do n't support most of the guys policys but it does n't mean i 'm ignorant enough that i fail to see why he is still popular . 
  we are clearly done here , you want to move this debate into ideology while i want to focus on the facts , it 's not going to work, 
  i do n't know what you have been reading but if putin had not took back control of resources from the oligarchs russia would be in the same place as ukraine is , much lower gdp/standard of living . 
  there is the oil argument but you would not have state owned behemoths like gasproim and rosatom steering the economy , you can continue to argue on many levels about putins assholeness which i would agree with but please do n't tell me he 's not improved the country remarkably . 
  a cut on western oil companies extracting the resources like they did in the 90 's is nothing compared to the revenues the state owned companies generate . 
  it seems to me you can only see `` whats good '' through the eyes of your own belief systems which i think is very selfish and unfortunately the sort of hubris that 's all too common in many folk , i could go on and on about why putins totalitarian rules is seen as a accepted nuisance and sacrifice by most russians in exchange for stability and growth but it 's mostly to do from the handover and clusterfuck that was the 90 's . 
  we see the worlds in different ways , i 'll be you think humanity , dignity , human rights , equal opportunity 's come above all else but unfortunately maslow 's hierarchy of needs which is an accepted psychological principle say safety and security come first , putin provides that currently so therefore he leads . 
   i consider russia of nineties to be a true democracy if by true democracy you mean plutocracy/kleptocracy  though young , revolutionary and in transition to the stable condition . 
  living standards in continual decline , absolute poverty widespread and continuing social , drug and alcohol problems that come with that  they made a lot of mistakes , but they were sincere and they were trying . 
  you were right about the first part but the only thing they were trying was to consolidate oligarch rule over all aspects of society , be it media , resources , agriculture et cetera . 
  the best russia would be if that continued would be a similar contrition ukraine is in today where a few people lord over everything in the country, 
   but they were sincere and they were ~ ~ tr ~ ~ ** d ** ying . 
  i think you missed a letter there , as for the rest of your comment i do n't know where to begin to tell you how wrong it is . 
  op do n't you know editorializing titles is frowned upon here, 
  so you agree or disagree with euronews and radio liberty 's definition of lviv as a nationalist stronghold , yes or no ? 
  i just do n't want to waste any more of each others time here and those two or three letters are all i 'm interested to hear form you now . 
  well we have to take another poll and ask 1000 ukrainians `` what is the most nationalist city in ukraine ? '', 
  i 'm willing to bet the answer will be undoubtedly lyiv or hey better still since you probably think i 'm admittedly partisan over ukraine what western media has to say about the place and area . 
  [ heartland of ukrainian nationalism , lviv speaks russian , for a day , to ease east-west divide ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-lviv-speaks-russian/25278317.html )  n the wake of pro-russian president viktor yanukovych 's ouster , residents ** in the western city of lviv -- a bastion of ukrainian nationalism ** -- have unexpectedly come out in support of ukraine 's russian-speakers [ ukraine : show of solidarity as nationalist stronghold lviv speaks russian for a day ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/27/ukraine-show-of-solidarity-as-nationalist-stronghold-lviv-speaks-russian-for-a-/ ) get over yourself , lviv is the most nationalist city in ukraine , i 'm not going to wast my time arguing the semantics of it while you continue shouting ` where are the proofs ', 
  well colour me plesently surprised . 
  pressure works , still think it would be easier if they involved us the public in the actual process then we would n't need to get so outraged and waste their valuable time and our tax money negotiating all of it , 
   til singing national anthem means a city is ` hyper nationalist ' . 
  when you gather around to do it nearly every weekend ( which seems top be the case ) it kinda is . 
  their complete faith in government media compared to the rest of the country only emphasizes this and the data backs me on this one . 
  i do n't know why you are so confrontational about it , sure i make it publicly know i do n't have much hopes for ukraine and their european path and i think they are a very corrupt country that will remain that way until they change their own culture by themselves and stop blaming russians under the bed for all their problems but you just constantly spend your time bashing russia and ideologically getting behind a side you know little about in reality i 'm guessing . 
  russia is a corrupt place but i 'm not an idiot either and know how important that country is to the economy of my own , you live ideological in la la land and would probably love to shut the border for good . 
  do n't make me laugh , we have out own `` citizens initiative '' they ignore every time for that sort of thing http://yle.fi/uutiset/all_six_citizens_initiatives_have_failed__activists_accuse_parliament_of_intentionally_slowing_the_process/7525779 people are not stupid , they see this shit being pulled over their eyes . 
  if there is anything good about the lack of democracy over ttip it 's how this may be the first thing that united europeans in continent wide protest for a long time and that is a sort of democracy i look forward to welcoming and it will come . 
  i do n't know what else you would call it , unlike a lot of people i have international friends in university in lyiv now who is constantly updating with pictures and videos of the solidarity marches they have there . 
  names removed for obvious reasons but this was just last weekend http://i.imgur.com/lxcq3b7.png i 'd happily rip and re-upload the video elsewhere if you somehow think i 'm making this up,
