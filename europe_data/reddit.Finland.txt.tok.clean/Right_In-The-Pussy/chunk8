  i agree and that 's why my mind which only thinks in terms of geopolitics and power relations does n't see much for ukraine . 
  at best they will remain destabilized and poor but in a multipolar less globalized world where we cant rely on china to build everything they will be a good source of cheap labour and production right on europes doorstep along with many the other ex balkan states not now in the eu . 
  i 'm so jaded about politics i do n't believe there is any `` good guys '' as long as ukraine hates russia that will do fine for the eu , in fact as long as russia is providing the stick the eu needs to buy them less carrots . 
  the eu as it stands needs to close the doors so it can focus on integrating all the other new countries instead of welcoming a new orphan to the dinner table ever week making things ackward for the rest of the family , to use a euphemism , and there you have your two their eu , core members who share a structural union and associated members of the free trade area . 
  nobody is going to be asked , that 's the problem . 
  at least in finland our dear politicians have already decided they think ttip is best for us despite not one of them making it a topic of discussion in elections . 
  so `` ratification of ttip '' is now there in text in the program for government and that 's all the democracy they plan over it , a few words basically saying `` we told you '' you seriously ca n't be surprised people are getting mobilized for action over this . 
  i totally disagree . 
  who 's the say doing it all in the open ca n't yield rewards too , leverage public outcry over certain aspects to win concessions from the other party . 
  oh wait , that would be transparent and honest leadership for the good of people and involving them in the process , ca n't have any of that now . 
  nobody should have the power to trade off entire sections of industry to gain concessions for others in the first place either . 
  people do n't want that sort of info , they are skeptical of the `` spin '' that can be put on the actual deal . 
  would you sign a contract with your employer without seeing it and then when you ask to see it they give you a summary in their own words ? 
  i doubt it . 
  in fact i 'd be very suspicious . 
  in that context this article is very relevant . 
  http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-22/eu-s-cynical-plan-to-use-eastern-europe weird to see bloomberg writing about the eu abandoning it 's plans and sort of ditching the eastern states it made promises to . 
  for example gerogia is very much swinging back to russia lately http://in.rbth.com/news/2015/05/19/georgia_to_keep_mending_ties_with_russia_says_premier_43189.html  georgia seeks to continue the process of mending relations with russia , prime minister irakly garibashvili said on tuesday . 
  the most telling or at least interesting one was the difference in approval of national media between the west and the east . 
  despite the fact ukraine has cut off all russian tv and has it 's own ministry of information thing going on the divide between trust and do n't trust is very obvious between east and west with 65 % of people in odessa not trusting national media for example . 
  http://i.imgur.com/tgyug68.png in contrast the hyper nationalist cities like lviv are totally in love with their national media with 77 % approving . 
  i do n't think any other question had such a variance and obvious east/west divide . 
  any ukrainians want to give some insight as this one really interests me ? 
  sorry , that 's my mistake , i tried to upload all the screenshots in numerical order , i guess that important one slipped by, 
  dude there 're called the 1 % for a reason , either that or the guy probably thought they were offering , [ `` corruption , yes ... no problem at all sir '' ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/9bqtoiy7dprsw/giphy.gif ), 
  yes i skipped the external politics stuff , i assumed the pro-eu/pro nato was a given at this point, 
   the bacteria xylella fastidiosa , ** believed to have originally come from the united states ** , has torn through southern italy since it first appeared in late 2013 . 
  ugh , of course it did \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  source and further questions : http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf, 
  then we agree , that sort of behavior is what you expect in the school yard with the cool girls saying xyz shoes ( you happen to be wearing ) are so ugly . 
  rogozin 's dick measuring is wrong too but not newsworthy the difference and annoyance to me is how people perceive the two very differently even though they are much the same thing . 
   imagine how german people would react if merkel 's number 2 would say something like that in context of entering russia . 
  on a primetime tv chatshow ... as an obvious joke , i 'd say i 'd take back some of the things i 've said about a lack of german humor . 
   wtf ? 
  where do you see ukrainian media ? 
  where do you see eu threatening to use military force against hungary even jokingly ? 
  what kind of a mess is in your head ? 
  i knew you a bit special , but you still are being able to amaze me . 
  i 'm replying to a ukrainian , this is how ukrainian media are phrasing it : [ russia 's deputy prime minister rogozin publicly threatened eu : `` tanks do not need visas '' ] ( http://en.censor.net.ua/news/337443/russias_deputy_prime_minister_rogozin_publicly_threatened_eu_tanks_do_not_need_visas ) i 'm highlighting their need to sensationalize every single misdirected fart that comes from russia 's general direction . 
   where do you see eu threatening to use military force against hungary even jokingly ? 
  calling someone who has been accused of cutting down on personal liberty 's and generally seen as a right wing nutjob by most the eu a dictator in a professional setting ( even jokingly ) is a diplomatic insult no matter how funny or how much you agree/disagree with the reasoning and politics behind it . 
  i mean sure maybe the rogozin guy is a bit of an idiot as well to talk like that publicly but here 's the thing it 's sure as fuck not newsworthy unless you have propaganda headlines to write . 
  i guess , i mean at the highest level it seems you can be a president of the eu and still slap other heads of state around so why not invasion jokes . 
  goods * but thanks , i hope you wont be supporting ttip either, 
  the statement was made in context of a joke , my god you guys like to play up everything as if ww3 is coming tomorrow . 
  i do n't understand russian but i trust the translation i read elsewhere ( or feel free to correct me if you understand ) video in question : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8sxbr7b5lg rogozin on a talk show literally says : ' i like to joke that tanks do n't need visas ' . 
  more of it , the host immediately replied that some countries may cut the citation and pretend that rogozin was threatening and would you look what we have here  is ukrainian media also writing how the president of the eu literally assaulted the pm of hungary last week as well ? 
  that 's just how reddit deals with vote brigading , thatsthejoke.jepg http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_vote_cheating_and_vote_manipulation.3f, 
   i would ask all of then to go out and vote to remain in the eu . 
  i always wondered how a shadowban works irl, 
  if the people of your country grow their own then they are not wrong . 
  every year out and stick a few carrots and potatoes in pile of dirt and shit in the tiny thing i call a garden and i 'm still amazed at how good they taste . 
  that said if you think the eu stuff is bad , us is just one step lower and not the way i want to be progressing , remembering the taste of the milk alone gives me a shiver . 
  have you ever tasted american food ? 
  if so you would n't know as it tastes of nothingness , i was going to come out with a more scientific well thought out reply but they have been covered in this thread and that sums up my thoughts on where this will take us . 
  unfortunately its easier for most to move on and sow your seeds elsewhere . 
  i 'm a contrarian however so i thrive on it, 
  yea i get what you 're saying , where does moral hazard begin and end ? 
  now i 'm paying for my house while you are being discounted on yours , et cetera . 
  shower thought but i always wondered if a leasing compromise could work here where someones home is n't flat out repossessed but instead they move it to the rental market with an option to return and in the interim live within their means elsewhere . 
  because it 's not like repossessions work for banks either as all they can do is then sell the place for the smaller value or rent it and in the end either the personal debt is forgiven of the bank is recapitalized at a later stage by the ecb for their losses . 
  either way i do n't believe in people turning on other less fortunate people but i ca n't change everyone else . 
   back in his office , he argued that offensive information strategies are required . 
  lithuania , he said , must create and disseminate its own narratives in order to boost patriotism worrying : /, 
  came here to say this , it 's hilarious to see what this sub has become . 
  i 'm no longer protesting it , moreso laughing at it, 
   her and her organization 's supporters are proud of what they consider nonviolent resistance . 
  as they should be , nonviolent resistance should be praised by all sides of the political spectrum but you are correct most right wing press has decided most non violent protesters either have an `` agenda '' now or are social parasites anyway and therefore should be ignored, 
  something very snide about the tone of the title/some of your comments here , what 's the message meant to convey op ? 
  not knowing what the significance of her protest was i can only say congrats on her election, 
  when conflict and active fighting die down so do peoples enthusiasm for war . 
  hence why you do n't want popular peoples revolutionary 's in your ranks :(, 
  the comments in here are worryingly uninformed but not entirely unsurprising , for those who do n't know/assume he was just another bad guy , mozgovoi was one of the more sane heads in the rebel ranks who had [ on many occasion called for peace and unity between both sides ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rft6_kvd_ro ) and was basically saying their war ( both the ukrainians and the novorussians ) should be with the oligarchs and not with each other . 
  it would seem the guy was an idealist and genuinely believed in a revolution and if anything that 's why i 'm not happy for his death as it consolidates the other form of top down command in the area and further destroys the `` peoples facade '' moving this more toward a true frozen conflict . 
  he actually wanted an end to conflict and that brought about his own end imo . 
  all this says now is [ do n't try and talk peace with ukrainian generals over skype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4k_aokca4c ) , get in line and obey . 
  edit : [ [ eng subs ] alexei mozgovoi 's call to mass media ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9n2tr93xxw&amp;list=ply96rnvqgjm8gmw_cbecbwsf91vmdemzu&amp;index=10 ) seems there is no time for deep thinkers on the novorussian side anymore : / just to add balance to my own comment , i 'm well aware the guy was a bit of a patriarchal religious zealot as well but given where he was and the world that existed around him i find it hard not to admire him in some respects considering his convictions and [ given the fact this was n't the first attempted assassination either . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv6uvdzxjb0 ) anyway i know i would have stfu after that happened the first time instead of continuing to speak out . 
  media is only starting to pick up on it now . 
  here is a ukrainian link from an svoboda ( right sector ) affiliated source that appears to confirm the original story linked by / u/orion4321 http://uapress.info/ru/news/show/77421 not sure what a reasonable burden of proof is in this context but besides the reports that are now coming out i can say via a reverse image search these pictures have not surfaced on the internet before today . 
  / r/dadjokes he 's either been waiting years to get that one out or has been telling it to every fare he picked up that day . 
  either way that is the most stereotypical dublin taxi driver they could have found , even the name checks out, 
  funny few private schools and a no homework policy seem to be working fine for us , ) http://neomam.com/blog/there-is-no-homework-in-finland/ corroboration/causation and all that but from what i see you brought in independent schools , lower grade teachers and a shitload of people from an immigrant background so within one of those must likely be the problem, 
  but you have privately run schools now do n't you and it 's only recently the results took a dive . 
  my brother works as a tefl teacher in south korea , he says he would never want to put his kid through the education system there . 
  they are pretty much worked 10 - 12 hour days with extra learning after school for most . 
  for a few simple points on a scale and for the kids happiness i 'd take the finnish system any day, 
  oh dear gawd , just sprayed my euroshopper energy drink all over the place now . 
  incoming pissed off swedes in 5 ... 4 . . 
  i have to get back to my own work here so i 'll keep this short and probably end it here but i see it like this , economists and the specialists do n't know it all either . 
  it 's like this , there is a reason we do n't let programmers have the final say on the design and architecture of ict systems becasue expert users will usually think very differently than the typical user and will design with their own considerations in mind . 
  i do n't see any user involvement and feedback being considered in the architecture of these trade agreements and thats why they are doomed to be disliked . 
   stuff like ` we should increase prison sentences and reinstitute the death penalty ' tends to be popular with the public seriously i have n't met a single person who has said they are in favor of the death penalty and i 'm pretty sure europeans on a whole are against it too . 
  yea i 've heard calls for mob justice on occasion but that 's just people venting . 
  likewise i do n't see any pending popular initiatives for reintroducing the death penalty despite our ability to introduce any proposal for parliamentary debate . 
  i like your contributions here sometimes but you do give me the impression you have disdain for ordinary people and are some sort of wannabe elitist . 
  plus society takes a pick and choose attitude anyway when it comes to these populist policy 's you hate so much , for example academics by and large seem to agree austerity does n't work and that russia has valid concerns when it comes to nato expansion but yet here we are with mainstream politicians as `` populist '' as anyone . 
  even when the public and academia disagree for example the war in iraq politicians will engage in their own populist circlejerk until they get what they want so i see no reason to place any higher level of trust in what they say is good or bad . 
   from observation and personal experience , you learn a huge amount in a short time , but it 's a full-time thing . 
  you do n't lie , when first i came here for my masters we had four hours a week in class but it took at least two more out of class every day to then do the homework and actually learn everything .
