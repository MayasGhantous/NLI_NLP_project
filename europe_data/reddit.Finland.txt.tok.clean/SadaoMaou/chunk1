the simirarities are mostly basic words , and of course the grammar and structure are really similar . 
  it 's iraqi , not irakian . 
  no , there are not jobs for that much new people at once . 
  have you heard of the euro crisis ? 
  said by a romanian ... 
  because there are jobs in germany , unlike hungary , and they want to work . 
  they we 're talking about another dude . 
  nazi symbols are n't illegal in finland . 
   wa n't, 
  that 's not how this works russia, 
  am i being detained ???!, 
  yeah , i know that hungarian and finnish are related . 
  that 's why i wondered if it really was that old of a word , because the words that are more or less the same in all uralic languages are the most basic ones : numbers 1-5 , `` water '' , `` squirrel '' ( because of the importance of furs in the stone age ) , body parts , `` home '' ... 
  the word for currency kind of does n't fit in there , so that 's why i was surprised . 
  apparently , it comes from the italian `` valuta '' , which is derived from '' valutare '' , `` to value '' , so it seems that '' valuutta '' and `` value '' do indeed have the same root . 
  interestingly enough , the english `` currency '' comes from the latin `` curro '' , '' to run '' , which is a cognate to the english `` horse '' . 
  i wonder how that came about ... 
  finnish : kansainv\u00e4linen valuuttarahasto hey , we have almost the same word for currency !, 
  is it really that old of a word , or is it just a coincidence ? 
  \u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 ... 
  where have you been living ? 
  [ ms estonia ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ), 
  also hainan, 
  they say that finland is the most american country in europe ... 
  oh shit that 's right , just remembered why the turnover has n't happened yet . 
  i bet you that is actually one of the reasons ... that sweet sweet tax-free tho, 
  let 's make a deal : we give you \u00c5land , and you give us tornedalen . 
  why on earth would you want that money drain ? 
  you ca n't even have naval bases in there or anything ... 
  plot twist : the hall of the mountain king is actually inside halti and norway wants to get rid of the trolls . 
  hey , i 've got an idea !, 
  let 's give them \u00c5land in return !, 
  i do have other sources than wikipedia as well , it 's just the only one that i could find in english . 
  http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20011227ie9 since the writing of this article , the mari national theatre has been shut down , and the percecution of mari culture and tradition countinues getting worse . 
  i also find it funny how critising anything russia does is `` being part of the anti-russian circlejerk '' nowadays . 
  i do n't think that mari newspapers being forcibly shut down by the government , authors of books about the mari religion being persecuted , mari activists being harassed and silenced by the government , the government intending to flood the lands of the mari people and the mari national theatre being shut down is the same thing as english cultural influence over the rest of the world . 
  oh dammit , we forgot the free market \u2122 again !, 
  better luck next time netherlands !, 
  i find it awful how little the oppression of finnic peoples , for example the [ the mari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_people ) , in the russian federation is talked about in finland . 
  i really feel like finland should try to do at least something to help them , because if we do n't , then who will ? 
  it 's sad to see finnic culture and tradition slowly disappearing because of [ forced russification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_people#present_day ) . 
  so now , how about that european defense union ... ? 
  but it would n't be . 
  if war in the baltic breaks out , you can bet your bottom dollar the russians are coming for helsinki . 
  also , russian-controlled \u00c5land would be geopolitically untenable . 
  yeah , except if shit hits the fan in the baltic , we 're gon na be drawn in whether we 're in nato or not . 
  in such a situation , `` securing '' the northern coast of the gulf of finland is top priority for the russians . 
  \u00c5land is also a very good point to control the baltic sea from .

  what does `` viking blood '' mean , then ? 
  `` viking '' is n't an ethnicity , that 's literally the same as calling caribbeans `` pirates '' . 
  yay , ^ we 're ^ ^ special ... 
  language = / = genetics . 
  related language does n't necessarily mean common ancestry . 
  no , loppukahdennus is in standard finnish , at least was just few years ago when i was in high school . 
  written `` ota kirja '' - pronounced `` otak kirja '' . 
  surprise , it 's the thought police !, 
  i think / u/h2ppyme was talking about ww2 , not the korean war . 
  at least sipil\u00e4 actually * is * self-made . 
  maybe it was the case before the fall of the ussr ? 
  not a major one . 
  the bottom right corner of the political compass is the area where the finnish party selection is most severely lacking , as [ you can see in this picture of the positions of the candidates of the major parties ] ( https://i.redd.it/omhn90lhutky.png ) . 
  there are the pirate party and the newer and smaller liberal party ( formerly known as the whiskey party ) , but they are both very small and have never had seats in the parliament . 
  they both did get some seats in these municipal elections though , which is a positive surprise . 
  they have also had such gems as `` your opinion ca n't be wrong , because it 's your opinion '' . 
  so , yeah . 
  enough said . 
  a big reason a lot of people like the greens is that they 're one of the most pro-urban parties , which is a good counterweight for the centre party , which a lot of city folks ( at least in / r/suomi ) dislike , as many of their policies seem to be geared towards stifling growth in the cities and funneling more funds to the emptying countryside . 
  the greens , on the other hand , have advocated for a shift of focus more towards the bigger cities and bringing city policy on par in priority with wider regional policy . 
  as others have said , they 're by no means the kind of single-issue party many other green parties in the world seem to be , and are , for example , very pro-student , which of course attracts young academics . 
  the current government has made a lot of unpopular cuts to the education budget that are often seen as inefficient and `` saving money in the wrong place '' . 
  it 's all the more disappointing when basically all the parties in the government promised to not cut from education in the last elections . 
  the social values of ncp politicians really range all across the liberal/conservative spectrum . 
  the party is mostly about being fiscally conservative / economically liberal ( weird how those terms mean roughly the same despite sounding like opposites ) . 
  what do you base your assumption of russia being whiter than poland on ? 
  i 'd have assumed the exact opposite . 
  why not just talk about european countries ? 
  talking about the eu in the 1800s is a bit like talking about nato in world war 1 . 
  what ? 
  who was talking about iran ? 
  my comment was in response to op saying that `` the eu countries '' were unable to house the irish refugees during the famine . 
  i did n't say anything about the us being evil . 
  you 're grasping for a straw that 's just not there . 
  i 'm talking about the `` irish population coming to the us because eu countries were unable to house them during the famine '' part . 
  you really ca n't talk about `` eu countries '' in the context of the 19th century . 
  finland definitely * was * a country , the grand duchy of finland , that was ruled by the grand duke of finland , who also was the emperor of russia . 
  not an * independent * country , mind you , but a country nonetheless . 
  from wikipedia :  a country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography . 
  a country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state , as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . 
  finland in 1906 definitely fills that criteria . 
  i know this might be hard for a belgian to understand , but in order to protect it 's national sovereignty finland needs to have a credible national defense . 
  also , in finland , the mandatory military service is often ( not by everyone , of course ) seen as a positive thing for society , as it is a valuable learning experience for young men and is sometimes seen as building a sense of national unity . 
  it 's not like you have to serve in the military , either : civilian service is an option . 
  you could also just refuse to serve , in which case you 'll just have to spend some time in house arrest or something . 
  this is n't `` official '' , of course , but getting exempted from service is also rather easy ; it 's not like the army really needs all the conscripts , especially unmotivated ones , so they usually are willing to let you go rather easily . 
  i personally gladly fulfill my duty to protect my country , because i really do believe that our society is something worth defending . 
  if that kind of common societal sharing of responsibility is `` authoritarian '' , so be it . 
  ahh , the crappy finnish dub where [ a woman just reads the story out while you can still hear the original dialogue on the background ] ( https://youtu.be/fh1xbky53ls?t=2m ) .
