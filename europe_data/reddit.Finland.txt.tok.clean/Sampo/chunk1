[ if this is your idea of better dressed . 
  ] ( http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hypebeast-wordpress/image/2008/10/mens-vogue-moncler-down-jacket-austin-5.jpg ) the mediterraneans in finland also wear those . 
  what 's the idea behind those jackets ? 
  [ at the top left corner ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/travel/downloads/tube_map.gif ), 
  the strong english tea is meant for drinking with milk . 
  if you try it black , it 's not so good . 
  well let 's take the chairpersons of the finnish parties : kokoomus ( right-wing ) : ** alexander stubb ** -- like you explained , some people consider him a dick . 
  keskusta ( center , agrarian ) : ** juha sipil\u00e4 ** -- new , but already considered a dick . 
  social democrats : ** antti rinne ** -- new , but has a background in workers ' unions and organizing strikes , so everyone in the right knows he 's a dick . 
  vasemmistoliitto ( radical lefit ) : ** paavo arhinm\u00e4ki ** -- outside of leftists , considered a dick and a hooligan . 
  green party : ** ville niinist\u00f6 ** -- this guy is pretty neutral , so not everyone considers him a dick . 
  but a lot of people hate the greens in general . 
  also convicted of tax evasion . 
  swedish peoples party : ** carl haglund ** -- nobody really knows anything about him , but because the swedish party , probably a dick anyway . 
  christian democrats : ** p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen ** -- a widely known religious nutjob and a total dick . 
  what about any other language outside of the indo-european language family ? 
   but he very often flips his opinions to serve his political aims any examples ? 
   a large proportion of finns did not vote for his party . 
  a large proportion of finns did not vote for any single party . 
  you really have some strange notions about how parliamentary democracy works . 
   i was trying to bring light to why some people consider him to be a bit of a ` dick ' take a right-wing political leader in pretty much any european country , and the left-wingers will consider that person to be a dick . 
   however it 's one of the aspects of the national coalition party and his personal views that tend to be quite unpopular with wide parts of finnish society come on !, 
  a lot of the opinions of * any party * are unpopular among the voters of * other * parties . 
   indoctrination of children through their education i do n't know , but i 'm still thinking that maybe the indoctrination of children by atat\u00fcrks ideas was probably an improvement over what was taught to the children before his time ? 
   more [ art ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/sites/default/files/u184683/yanukovych2.jpg ) nsfw what , i just ... what ? 
   a bit more stability belgium has n't been very stable in the recent past , though . 
  first floor = ground floor also at least in nordic countries . 
  i know in britain it 's not . 
  how the rest of the europe counts their floors , i do n't know . 
  i do n't think anyone in present day ukraine wants to kill any poles . 
  who knows how treacherous the soviets could have been , but after the [ moscow armistice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_armistice ) the politicians at least thought the threat was over . 
  finland used to have a thing for bunker-like churches .

   clueless left acting as pawns of nationalistic interests of kinds like putin is all the putin-sympathy coming from leftists in west germany ? 
  or are there some pro-russia opinions in the east germany , too ? 
   nazi you know , in ww2 finland literally allied with hitler to have a fighting chance against russia . 
  after the danger of russian occupation was over , the alliance was quickly dropped . 
   sweet swedish thinking i do n't think being pro-nato and wanting to put an end to russia 's bullying is very typical swedish thinking . 
  why is there no polish immigrants in finland ?

  '' * why ? 
  smiled at your comment . 
   hungarians voted for their own hangman victor orban i wonder if the alternative would have been any better ? 
   how insanely corrupt they are i thought the people voted the current right-wing government in , because the previous left-wing governtment was insanely corrupt ? 
  why does sweden get all the russian submarines ? 
  we in finland would also need some help to convince the population to support joining nato . 
   what do finns believe to be the most proximate cause of the decline ( ? ), 
  of the nokia mobile phone ? 
  [ the next ceo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olli-pekka_kallasvuo ) , after jorma ollila and before stephen elop , was a lawyer by training , and his backround was in the finance division . 
  ( ollila was an economist and an engineer . ), 
  not really a technology visionary material , more like a [ bean counter ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bean_counter ) . 
  at this time , nokia had developed a bad syndrome of large amount of middle managers . 
  the [ symbian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbian ) division was large . 
  anybody who understands software already knew that symbian is no good platform for future smartphones . 
  but the [ maemo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maemo ) / [ meego ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meego ) division was small and experimental , and because they were small , they did n't have much voice in the internal corporate politics . 
  the overwhelming political lobbying from the big symbian division actually blocked making the [ n800 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n800 ) and [ n810 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n810 ) devices into phones . 
  because the symbian faction did n't want the maemo division to grow as their competitor . 
  lots of symbian division managers might have lost their jobs , or at least their influential positions . 
  if the [ n810 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n810 ) had been a phone in 2007 when the iphone came ( like the [ n900 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n900 ) finally was in 2009 ) , it might have provided some competition to the first iphone . 
  and because the top leadership did n't have technical background or visionary qualities , they did n't realize to abandon symbian and to put resources on meego . 
  the meego team really was quite small all along , and they did a good job culminating in [ n9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n9 ) but it was much too late . 
  so nokia was going down already from 2006 at least . 
  when stephen elop started in 2010 he actually brought at least a little technological vision to nokia : he finally killed of symbian . 
  well he also made some bad moves , and the windows phone os from microsoft was much more unfinished than what nokia thought , bringing the last fatal delays . 
  but even going with windows phone was , in my opinion , a better course than trying to go against iphone with symbian . 
  of course , if nokia had gone strongly with maemo already from 2005 , a lot things would have been different . 
  but jorma ollila was ceo until 2006 , at the same time when he grew nokia into the world 's leading mobile phone * hardware * company , he already sowed the seeds of downfall by failing to notice that the future of smartphones was in * software * . 
  [ or maybe it was this ] ( https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10711109_10152448211837916_3474860641007631742_n.jpg?oh=3295d30452b42816acf5a80866c990e3&amp;oe=54e8b1c8 ), 
  probably because of the beggars and the street musicians ( who play the same bad tune over and over ) . 
   the swedes left you to the russians they did that a lot . 
  polish minority supports russia ? 
  will there be a neo-nazi -- kurds alliance , then ? 
  somebody had this theory that russia might try to take gotland . 
  just to test the waters , so to say . 
  surely the west would not start ww3 over such a small island . 
  p\u00f8lse i can understand , but the chocolate milk that -- i was told -- traditionally goes with it , was a bit strange combination . 
  wow , i did n't know other countries also joke that there is too little meat in their sausages . 
  did n't your new prime minister just say that sweden will not into nato ? 
   for instance , italy and spain it 's a sad state of affairs when you have to go spain looking for a job in this economy . 
  or , the other way round , think of the australian or new zealander communities in e.g. 
  london . 
  they have the same language as the brits , but they are culturally different . 
   it is in fact a bit odd to me , we apparently use a different concept of ethnicity here in the balkans . 
  do you think the belgians speak belgian ? 
   we 'd say they 're croatian citizens of italian ethnicity . 
  think of switzerland . 
  the french speaking swiss or the italian speaking swiss do n't consider themselves french or italian . 
  they are swiss who just happen to speak french or italian . 
  in 1999 [ transmeta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transmeta ) was still in [ stealth mode ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stealth_mode ) , and no-one knew what the company was working on .
