  is there any way the police could search for illegal immigrants that would not cause criticism ? 
  or , is the police `` damned if you do , damned if you do n't '' whatever they do ? 
  you did sail across the sea ( 150 km wide ) to colonize us in finland, 
   someone from a member of the eu needs to claim asylum well it 's debatable whether they * need * to claim asylum , perhaps they do it just because they can , or they can give it a try, 
  +1 for `` probably true everywhere . '', 
  lol, 
  i would post the explanation , but i do n't know how to format blacked-out text to hide the spoiler, 
  in [ r/arabs ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arabs ) people seem to have several flags ( 2 or 3 usually ) in their flair . 
  it 's kinda funny , that countries who only recently got their shit together , are the most vocal critics of the countries who have not yet got their shit together . 
  understandable , but funny . 
  actually i do n't think it 's so bad here . 
  yes , we have some quite vocal people who cry racism like [ the boy who cired wolf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_boy_who_cried_wolf ) , but ( a ) it 's the same in our national discussion , in newspapers etc. 
  so reddit just reflects real life , which is kinda good and realistic , and ( b ) now 1 hour after your comment , if you look who gets upvoted and who gets downvoted , the wolf-criers do n't get much upvotes , and people like you , with more moderate opinions , seem to get more upvotes . 
  also the estonian wikipedia seems to use `` j\u00f5ulud '' : http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b5ulud, 
  let me propose a rule of thumb : if [ gay pride ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pride_parade ) parades are not business-as-usual , but face opposition from local authorities or need special police protection from potentially violent anti-gay protesters , then the country is mentally eastern europe . 
  but a swede would pronounce ` h\u00e4n ' as ` hen ', 
   the use or non-use of `` hen '' , a gender neutral pronoun . 
  while you 're at it , could you also combine the ` en ' and ` ett ' genders to only one ? 
  ( ` ent ' ? ), 
  would make swedish easier to learn . 
  i guess you have n't listened much punk ? 
   they have trouble keeping the rhythem are n't eurovision performances playback anyway ? 
   we 're actually considered a third world country by western standards . 
  recently moved from europe to us . 
  can confirm . 
  texas is the america of the usa ? 
   the kardashians and skhreli are albanian . 
  good sir , you must be american , are you not ? 
   a fair and democratic referendum would include the rest of spain voting in this matter , yes ? 
  are you a moron ? 
   i feel that people from smaller countries in europe want the others cut down to size ... or we just have sympathy for anyone who aspires freedom and independence , because our own road to independence was not easy , so we do n't take independence for granted . 
   vying for independence is insanely risky without any sense of cooperation from the state you 're trying to secede from i , for one , am immensely happy finland declared independence anyway in 1917 . 
  and i am sure estonians are very happy that they did that in 1991 . 
  without cooperation from russia . 
  [ pol pot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pol_pot ), 
  pot ? 
  do they have missiles ? 
   funny thing though is that in many of these countries right wing parties are successful . 
  would n't it be even crazier to vote left wing , after you have suffered under a socialist regime ? 
   back in the soviet sphere i do n't think the soviets exist anymore . 
  eu citizens can vote in local elections . 
  just not in parliament elections . 
  are you sure there would not have been a revolution against saddam , if the west had let iraq on its own ? 
  so you are saying , we should have supported saddam ? 
  so , in short , your opinion is that the west should have given better support for the assad regime ? 
   the us and britain share blame for boosting the house of saud into control so they get the blame when they do n't support a dictator but let him fall in one country , and then they get the blame for supporting a dictator in another country ? 
  you mean ** folk metal ** , right ? 
  maybe [ lai lai hei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su-febdntuk ) by ensiferum . 
   what can we get you ? 
  finnish sausages are awfully bland . 
  do you have spicy ones ? 
   refugees need to be able to get a job asap the labour unions in finland would rather stop the whole country than allow masses of cheap labour to compete for jobs . 
   just naming a guy muhammad is n't going to upset anyone . 
  naming a teddy bear muhammad , [ on the other hand ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudanese_teddy_bear_blasphemy_case ), 
  red lobster standing by, 
  maybe this song helps . 
  he starts to sing at 1.07 . 
  here are first 3 lines of the lyrics , just spot the \u0131 's . 
  yine d\u00fc\u015ft\u00fck yollara , yollara , yollara yine a\u015ft\u0131k da\u011flar\u0131 , da\u011flar\u0131 , da\u011flar\u0131 aya\u011f\u0131m gaz pedal\u0131nda , ard\u0131mda f\u0131rt\u0131na https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymeosgyge1y and here some estonian . 
  the same as the turkish \u0131, 
   it was sustained by the us because we gave a ton of weapons to groups that fought assad . 
  in 2011 , the free syrian army was founded by syrian military officers who defected because assad told them to kill syrian people , and they did n't want to comply . 
  so they rebelled . 
  at that time it seemed reasonable to support them , and to have some faith that they were going to build a better , more democratic syria . 
  i do n't think we should be blamed too hard for having had some naive idealistic faith in them . 
  they should have invaded hamburg . 
   now the german people have to pay for her idiocracy . 
  democracy in action . 
   internal migration of kurds within turkey is very high , especially to istanbul and other western cities . 
  who do the kurds vote for in elections ? 
  just like , if northern ireland would get independence from the uk , i doubt ireland would even accept them joining to ireland . 
  northern ireland is bunch of backwards people who mostly know how to complain , make trouble , and live on state benefits . 
  it would be a burden for ireland to take them . 
   first turkey should stop oppressing peaceful freedom loving kurds i do n't understand why turkey does n't let the kurds have their kurdistan anyway . 
  it 's the poorest part of turkey , and turkey would be better of without them . 
   travel to denmark and try to reach sweden . 
  and sweden transports 500 -- 1000 per day to finnish border . 
   lagers are forbidden i very much prefer a pale ale , anyway . 
   and hungary sent them straight to austria . 
  i think at that time everyone was still assuming that germany will accept them , and that austria is ok to give them passage to germany ? 
  when austria and then germany made it clearer that they do n't want those people , hungary started to build the fence quickly . 
  so , if we believe in rebirth , it follows that your current life is already an afterlife for your previous life . 
  so you are already living in some form of afterlife . 
  and you said the afterlife would give answers . 
  so do you have your answers now ? 
   when the economy is in recession ? 
  yes , of course you do . 
  finland has been piling more debt [ since 2008 ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/talous/article6768114.ece/alternates/w960/8_8%20%20velkataakka%20nousee.png ) . 
  people are finally starting to think that this can not go on forever . 
  the demonstration/strike was organized by the opposition , who lost the elections in april 2015 . 
  my guess is , the majority of people still support the government . 
  not necessarily . 
  for example , hindus believe in thousands and thousands of gods , but they do n't believe in the afterlife , they believe in rebirth back into this world . 
  maybe you will be reborn as a farmer in argentina . 
  how is that for an afterlife ? 
  when you die , you just die , you know . 
  you wo n't be getting any answers . 
  the reporter might have her own agenda , and choose the most stereotypical people for the photos . 
  also , the swedish language news comes from the separate swedish speaking section of yle , so the staff is swedish speaking , and the swedish speaking minority in finland has , on average , more swedish type values than the average finn . 
   da'esh why do you call isis da'esh ?
