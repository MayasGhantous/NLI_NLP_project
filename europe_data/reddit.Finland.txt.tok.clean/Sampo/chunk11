   one day , we 'll both die and we 'll see which one of us wins . 
  how does dying help finding out who `` wins '' ? 
  and estonian \u00f5, 
   my country atlantis ? 
   perhaps the biggest shock i 've experienced in sweden , in terms of problems , is the housing shortage . 
  sweden has created a pretty unique mess in that respect , yes . 
  * the analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics , and -- among economists , anyway -- one of the least controversial . 
  in 1992 a poll of the american economic association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that '' a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing . '', 
  almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control , using its known adverse side effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand . 
  * [ wrote paul krugman in year 2000 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html ) . 
  probably our politicians will need to figure it out by trial and error , instead of learning from other 's experiences . 
   so , again , how are you not a fucking hypocrite ? 
  you are correct , i was a hypocrite . 
  fenno-urgic people ( finns , estonias , sami and others , and for now i also include hungarians because they speak a fenno-ugric language ) have mostly been on the receiving end of the bad things in history . 
  thus is tends to be more socially acceptable to joke about `` fenno-ugric '' master race , because it is more obviously a joke than the stereotype of a rich american joking about polish plumbers . 
  the former is more obviously a joke , the latter feels less politically correct , because those attitudes could also happen in real life . 
  but you are correct , this is kind of hypocritical . 
   nazi ideology unrelated detail : the nazis actually [ did n't consider finns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honorary_aryan#to_the_finns ) as part of the nordic race . 
  what 's your opinion on / r/pcmasterrace ? 
   aww , well i 'm offended by your suggestion that finns are the `` master race '' . 
  yes , that was meant as a joke . 
  i apologize for not marking it with / s. 
  one more point comes to my mind : it has been a really long while since white americans killed white americans by masses . 
  but in europe the has been ethninc cleansings as recently as [ in the 1990s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_in_the_bosnian_war ) . 
  bosniaks , croats and serbs are all white , but when they are ethically cleansing each other , we tend to call that racisms . 
  you can call it whatever you like . 
   it 's almost like ethnicities and races are two different things i have no trouble with the word `` racism '' having different meanings in different languages and in different countries . 
  the european tradition is closer to the unesco 1978 [ declaration on race and racial prejudice ] ( http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-url_id=13161&amp;url_do=do_topic&amp;url_section=201.html ) , which includes definitions like : `` any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on ** race , color , ethnic or national origin ** or religious intolerance '' `` any restriction on the complete self-fulfillment of human beings and free communication between them which is based on ** racial or ethnic ** considerations '' `` any form of organization or any practice which is based on ideas or theories referring to the alleged superiority of ** racial or ethnic groups ** '', 
  nah , a temporary work gig at an american university . 
  i am saying that discriminating against different ethnicities , or even against different religions , is quite generally regarded as racism in europe . 
  i guess the colloquial use of the word differs between us and europe in this regard . 
   or are you saying that poles are nonwhite ? 
  you seem to be stuck to the idea that there are only two kind of people in the world : white and black , and thus racism can only happen between these two groups . 
  in the light of american history , your attitude makes some sense . 
  but the rest of the world is not america . 
  i can understand that in america all white americans are regarded as white americans . 
  but in europe being racist towards different ethnicities -- even if they are different ethnicities from europe -- is usually regarded as racism . 
  and the politicians are mostly , so far , blind to what happened in hungary etc. 
  this week . 
  they have made emergency plans to accommodate a couple of thousand extra * per year * . 
  if one thousand * per day * start to come , it will take everyone by total surprise . 
  so far there have been tents for most , but not everyone wants to go a reception center , so some people are sleeping outdoors in kemi town center . 
   i have a new found respect for that country . 
  [ finno-ugric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages ) master race !, 
  so in america it 's ok to be racist , if the target does not have dark skin ? 
   are they really leaving sweden in mass ? 
  i think they are people who recently travelled through germany , denmark and sweden , in order to apply for asylum in finland . 
   what do they seek in finland ? 
  sweden has already cut down the monthly allowance paid for people who are waiting for their application to be processed . 
  finland has not . 
  also , sweden mostly denies applications from iraq and somalia , classifying parts of those countries as safe . 
  finland mostly does n't . 
  also , they say that the wait for family reunification applications is much longer in sweden than in finland . 
  basically , since finland has so far received much less migrants than sweden , our policies are still as `` nice '' as they were in sweden before sweden started to tighten its policy . 
  also finland is currently receiving only 300-500 people per day , and they are arriving in the north , across the land border from sweden , so the situation is not yet `` visible '' in finland . 
  also , there is some * really * hot internal political disagreements ( not related to the migrant crisis ) going on at the moment , so the migrants get only second class status in importance in the news at the moment . 
  because of all this , the whole topic is not yet as widely discussed in finland as in most of europe . 
  but if the town of [ kemi ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/vanhanen_suomen_pitaa_varautua_yli_100_000_turvapaikanhakijaan__parempi_varautua_kuin_katua/8314015 ) ( population 20 000 ) near the swedish border keeps receiving 300-500 migrants per day , or if this rises to over 1000 per day , this topic will eventually get more visibility . 
  ( also , most of the finnish population lives in the south and does not much care about the people living in the north . ), 
   so what comes after finland ? 
  ... estonia ? 
   they are gon na take our jobs the migrants probably do n't want your jobs . 
  swedish railways is adding trains and making trains longer , so they can transport up to 1000 people per day to the finnish land border in the north . 
   denmarck is that how you spell denmark in dutch ? 
   i can tell you that all scandinavia , germany , france , benelux are pretty left wing . 
  norway , denmark and finland have currently their right-wing parties in government , and left-wing parties are in the opposition . 
  sweden has left-wing government . 
  about iceland , i do n't know . 
  [ `` europe or die '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj3akgvqif4 ) , a 1h45min documentary from 2014 . 
  yes , but we could compare the traffic across the copenhagen -- malm\u00f6 connection to the expected traffic of helsinki -- tallin connection . 
  we could compare to copenhagen -- malm\u00f6 tunnel . 
  geology is much better than in the channel . 
  solid nordic bedrock , except the last bits on the estonian end . 
   they 're energising the party faithful in the areas and seats which they can already win a surprisingly common mistake in politics . 
   i do n't see anything on his wikipedia page that indicates that corbyn is advocating for world socialist revolution . 
  i did n't mean that . 
  it 's just , unilateral disarmament is traditionally supported by the political left . 
   but rather state capitalism yes , but it was build by socialists . 
   odd how peter 's bullshit supersedes jesus actual words well , it was peter who established numerous congregations and spread christianity around . 
  all jesus achieved was 12 converts . 
   seems like jesus disagrees with you . 
  who cares what jesus thinks . 
  the idea of the [ new covenant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_covenant ) is an established part of christian theology . 
  even i was taught about it at school when i was a kid . 
  what about [ mark 2:23 -28 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+2%3a23-28&amp;version=esv ) ? 
   his stance on uk 's security and territorial integrity but that was part of the original socialistic ideology , was n't it ? 
  when the proletariat takes power in each country approximately at the same time , a world revolution is achieved and armies become unnecessary . 
  in the east , you are way past these stupid ideas , and you may not understand in the west some people are not . 
  the whole idea of cherry picking is inbuild in christianity , the new testament superceding the old testament . 
  some polish person here in / r/europe once wrote that in poland , socialism is viewed as a peculiarity of the past , something that is obviously as bad an idea that e.g. 
  feudalism was . 
  if this is true ( ? 
  ) , i wonder if polish people realize , how socialism never went away . 
  western europe has always had , and still has , not a majority , but a notable amount of people who vote and support the radical left . 
  [ muphry 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muphry's_law ), 
   `` untill open boarder '' in his sign it 's actually spelled correctly : border , not boarder . 
  and : until , ~ ~ nut ~ ~ not untill . 
   many people believe in left economic principles [ ... ] who the fuck do you vote then ? 
  i have n't followed closely , but does n't sd have centre-left economic policy ? 
  i did n't know i can almost read greek .
