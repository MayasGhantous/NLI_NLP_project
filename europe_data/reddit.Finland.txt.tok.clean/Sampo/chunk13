   the eu should pay for the migrants and refugees to fly to europe . 
  as far as i understand , those migrants have paid much more than the price of a normal flight ticket for their journey . 
  if europe allowed them to take a flight , instead of an overland journey , they would be perfectly capable to pay their flights themselves . 
   getting a real guarantee that nato will come to our defence so protection from finland is not enough anymore ? 
  also an [ article in english ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150901/swedish-party-in-u-turn-on-nato-membership ) . 
  sorry for submitting a swedish article in the first place ... 
  traditionally , swedish politics has been a power struggle between the right-wing [ `` alliance '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_%28sweden%29 ) ( moderate party , centre party , liberal people 's party , christian democrats ) block and the left-wing block ( social democrats , green party , left party ) . 
  ( and currently the sweden democrats who do n't belong to either block . ), 
  now when the centre party declares support for joining nato , the whole right-wing block unanimously supports nato . 
  if they rise from opposition to government in next elections , who knows ... 
   ... are our cultures gone ? 
  i suspect the european left wants a much stronger welfare , than usa has at the moment . 
   if he wants to put innocent people into jail ? 
  then yes , he would commit a crime . 
  but he did n't , yet , put anyone in jail . 
  so according to your `` you ca n't jail a person who did not commit a crime '' you can only lock him up after he has locked someone up . 
  right ? 
   how about all those doctors , engineers , all kinds of educated professionals and in general cheap labor that you get ? 
  the western european countries could let those people in anyway and give them work permits , if they want . 
  and you have progressed too far from the soviet times to install any control on people leaving your country . 
   people like you should be locked up . 
  did he commit a crime ? 
  someone should inform the techniker about these problems . 
  what is there to discuss about atheism , year after year , anyway ? 
  maybe edit your post above and fix it ? 
   sharply tailored french units, 
   all the uk citizens living abroad without a job should also be sent back again , that is not for uk to decide . 
  but for the particular country . 
  i wonder how much that house in the picture would cost . 
   if eu nationals are kicked out of uk then uk nationals should be sent back to the uk . 
  i think this is just fair . 
  should n't it be , like , totally up to spain , who they want to send back or not ? 
  not your business at all , but theirs . 
   halla-aho did n't get sentence from that parody text yes he did . 
  not in finland . 
  also companies and organizations have successfully shut down websites that critique them using parody , by claiming that as the parody website resembles the original , it breaks copyright . 
  ( [ source in finnish ] ( http://www.turre.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pelleily-sallittu-hietanen.pdf ) ), 
  [ you got ta feel berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovrwq1zdmys ), 
   turkey is hosting more than 2 million of them since 3 years . 
  but they are not applying for asylum in turkey , right ? 
   or just go nord go [ nord ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nchq0m67lq8 ) . 
   leave the union perhaps the union should have a referendum , too . 
  maybe thats why he does n't want such parties to gain more votes . 
  not very accurate , as according to the posted article , israel only asked that gold/treasures of jewish origin should be returned to the families , and if the owner can not be identified , used to the benefit of ** polish ** jews . 
  so , you should take less immigrants so that the rest of the world would not start to think you hate immigrants so much . 
  i am pretty sure russia would oppose anyway . 
  but those were under the swedish rule in finland . 
   european farmers do n't need more yields . 
  so you are saying europe would need less efficient agriculture ? 
  maybe abandon tractors and go back to plowing with horses , that should help ? 
   in the netherlands for example they are objectively as much as a problem as right wing extremists . 
  in the netherlands , [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkert_van_der_graaf ) murdered [ pim fortuyn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pim_fortuyn ) . 
   firstly left = / = liberal while this is / r/europe , some people might use those words in their american english meaning . 
  i do n't currently live at where i am from , so not sure how to answer your question . 
  ... or does `` where are you from ? '', 
  in english just mean the same as `` where do you live ? '', 
   even content straight-up lying or editorialized beyond recognition gets upvoted , because most people stop at the headline . 
  editorializing * is * against the rules of / r/europe, 
  is there a rule against them ? 
   sometimes i feel we should go back on the unification so basically you want people who you do n't like , out of your country ? 
  after a certain number of more attacks , people will be happy to let go of some of those rights and liberties . 
  so what is chocolatine , then , in the * megasujet * - language ? 
  same answer applies to half of eu countries . 
  i was just wondering , why would we get the first news about this from german media ? 
  but apparently it was only that op was mostly following german media but the news was all around elsewhere , too . 
  i was not, 
   according to major german news do greek news know about this ? 
  but your water taps are not . 
   the mods are pretty much the unelected facist censors of the propaganda machine reddit . 
  it is entirely up to the mods , in which manner they run their own subreddit . 
  in theory you should be able to establish a subreddit with non/fascist mods , too . 
  for any web forum , there will always be someone behind it , who has the power to be as fascist as they want . 
   an enormously vocal minority how do you know it 's a minority ? 
  we win !, 
  we would . 
  did / r/vexillology also do it the same way ? 
   comments comments , not posts . 
  you have misunderstood the context of that part of reddiquette . 
  that part of reddiquette talks only about comments . 
  because for example / r/undelete exists , it should be evident that monitoring what kind if posts are deleted from a subreddit , is perfectly ok . incidentally , that same [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) also says :  # please do * ** moderate based on quality , not opinion . 
  ** well written and interesting content can be worthwhile , even if you disagree with it . 
   it 's too bad this never happened with / r/politics back in the day . 
  what happened with / r/politics , and how many months or years ago was back in the day ? 
  from an ideological point , double/multiple flags would be a good idea : to show that a lot of people have lived in multiple countries , and people can not be classified solely by their country of origin . 
   we can look into that . 
  there are subreddits , such as / r/arabs that allow for 2 or even 3 flags . 
  you do n't need to reinvent the wheel . 
   10:46 which timezone ? 
   i have never seen a high quality wordpress terence tao , perhaps the most famous mathematician alive , blogs on wordpress : https://terrytao.wordpress.com/, 
   wordpress.com domain are banned because they are known for having notoriously low quality content . 
  it 's a blogging platform . 
  some blogs are bad , some are good . 
  just like reddit comments . 
   find a different word anti-soviet ? 
  yesterday almost half of / r/europe was imgur-posts ? 
  would n't imgur also fall under unreliable source category ? 
   wordpress why is wordpress banned ? 
   participation in iraq and afghanistan invasions . 
  ca n't be truly western unless you invade middle-east every now and then . 
  i believe anyone ( with some programming skills ) could set up such a thing , if they wanted to spend some work on it .
