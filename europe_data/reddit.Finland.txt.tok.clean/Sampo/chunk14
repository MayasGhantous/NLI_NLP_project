  or they have used them all along, 
  but not on olive trees . 
   i would n't be putting those ideas out there if i were the finance minister of the only eurozone country in a three-year-long recession .

  putain de bordel de merde d'encul\u00e9 de sa race maudite de megathread ? 
   good friends with funny accents just like germans . 
  was it a refugee from greece ? 
   apologies for my countrys careless journalists . 
  which country ? 
   it 's also worth pointing out that they received their permanent residence permit before these events . 
  at least finnish newspaper iltalehti [ writes ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/ulkomaat/2015081220171404_ul.shtml ) that the stabber had received news about a decision to deport him , just hours before the stabbing . 
  do you have any sources for your claim ? 
   hans rosling prediction is an extrapolation of current trends . 
  any prediction is an extrapolation of current trends , or if it is n't , it 's just a guess . 
  ok , the first hit in your google search link is [ this abstract ] ( http://orgprints.org/12027/1/the_economic_impacts_of_gm_contamination_incidents_on_the_organic_sector.pdf ) , which lists cases , some of which are what we are looking for here . 
  but the references given make it difficult to find more direct sources . 
  but i am inclined to believe those stories can be true . 
  the next 4 links are not helpful . 
  but i have to say , the `` contamination '' is a problem only because it is defined to be . 
  if there were a large group of customers who did n't want `` organic contamination '' in their food , then also pollen from organic farms would present a similar contamination danger to the `` normal '' farms in the neighborhood . 
  do you a link to one case ? 
  i think it is extremely rare , that a gmo field and an organic field are right next to each other . 
  your problem is mostly theoretical . 
  yes , if you have two fields next to each other , and grow the same crop , a little bit of mixing can happen . 
  but there is no reason to call this contamination . 
  it has happened ever since year -5000 , or whenever people had two fields next to each other for the first time . 
  it is very normal . 
  there is so much monsanto-hate around , if there existed even one documented case , do n't you think someone would have added it to wikipedia ? 
  you are just repeating undocumented rumors . 
   mostly untrue always untrue . 
  wikipedia [ monsanto legal cases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monsanto_legal_cases ) does not list a single such case . 
  if you know about one , please tell . 
   crops still got negatively affected now that we excluded the untrue rumors , how does the negative effect appear ? 
  also non-gmo plant breeds can be patented . 
  the first plant patent was given in 1931 . 
   i am okay with gmo if it does n't have patents . 
  also non-gmo varietes can be , and are , patented . 
  for a modern example , google ` basf clearfield ' . 
  the [ first plant patent ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/plant-patents.html ) was given in the usa in 1931 . 
   farmers have to buy gmo-seeds every year from same provider and farmers are not allowed to store the seeds for the next year . 
  if they do so gmo-provider can sue the farmer this can happen ( [ has happened ] ( http://deltafarmpress.com/louisiana-clearfield-lawsuit-points-stewardship-requirements ) ) with non-gmo seed as well . 
  nothing to do with gmo . 
   i do n't mind gmo , but i do n't like the whole patent and copyright issues behind it the same issues actually apply to non-gmo varieties as well . 
  for example , google ` basf clearfield patent ' . 
   a study in america of a side by side comparison of biological and conventional agriculture  [ here is the link for those interested ] ( http://www.fnab.org/images/files/etudes/fstbrochure_rodale_institute.pdf ) [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rodale_institute ) : * `` rodale institute is an american 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit that supports research into organic farming . 
  '' * so i do n't think that institute could be considered unbiased in this respect . 
  better try to find a study done by some university . 
   nobody 's banning research and study in that field it would be funny , if cell phones were allowed for research and study , but not for making your daily life more easy ? 
   gmos have some potential issues care to name one or two ? 
   in denmark , you can not use pesticides in organic farming . 
  are you sure ? 
  in most countries ( that i know of ) , if a pesticide is produced as an extract from plants or animals , and not as a synthesized chemical , you can use it in organic farming . 
   do n't the environmental problems we 've caused come precisely from the fact that we 've tried to make agriculture efficient ? 
  conventional agriculture ( with fertilizers and machines ) produces lots of food , and relatively cheap food . 
  to produce the same amount of food with organic farming would need even more land area ( cut down even more forests ) and the food would be more expensive . 
  you seem to take the eco-fascist viewpoint , that the problem is that we have so much cheap food that we can feed 7 billion people , and that it would be better if a couple of billion would starve to death instead ? 
   the world is hugely over-populated . 
  is n't that the core of the problem ? 
  current estimates on population growth ( google hans rosling ) say that as education and healthcare proceed also in developing countries , women have started to have less children , and human population should peak at 12-13 billion , and then start to decrease . 
  so we are already seeing the end of the population growth in the horizon . 
  if we can just feed that amount of people ( and we can , with modern technology , it we use it efficiently ) for a while , we can solve the population crisis without deeding to purposefully starve billions of people . 
  btw , this [ same discussion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_population_bomb ) happened in the 1960 's , before [ green revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_revolution ) provided new plant breeds and fed hundreds of millions people , especially in india . 
  all this has happened before , but it does not need to happen again . 
   both the glyphosate-tolerant ( roundup ready ) and the bt trait for corn rootworm caused yields to drop . 
  every plant breeder knows that making the cultivar more tolerant ( bt trait : more tolerant to insects , glyphosate-tolerant : more tolerant to glyphosate ) incurs a metabolic cost ( `` yield drag '' ) for the plant , and thus decreases yield . 
  nothing comes for free . 
  in case of bt crops , you accept a small decrease in yield as an `` insurance '' so that you will not lose 100 % of crop in case the insects attack . 
   norway probably takes a slight lead for historical reasons . 
  i tried to read wikipedia , whether a swedish king ( or queen ) has ruled also over denmark , or a danish king ( or queen ) over sweden . 
  but man , all those intermarriages makes it very complicated to understand who ruled over who and when . 
  and internet censorship . 
  sweden can have a new grenade attack any time . 
  are you guys also expecting new breiviks to pop up ? 
   they just do n't make a scene about it at least in japan they have made [ some scenes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dm9lz8rwwi#t=8m02s ) . 
  but they say princeton is a small bubble of new england inside new jersey . 
   i 'm curious what your thoughts are on the country compared to finland ? 
  but the toilet seat bowls , the water level is so high that it if i am not careful it xxxxxxx xx xxxxx . 
  how can you people live with these abominations !?!, 
  in general , whenever i leave the nordic bubble , the first things in a foreign city that i notice are : more rubbish on the streets , pavement has cracks all over , lots of buildings are badly maintained ( paint is old and worn , cracks , sometimes graffiti ) . 
  london , boston , berlin , does n't matter . 
  the first hours it feels like i am in a third world city , before i calibrate my brain about how much rubbish and cracks and unfixed damage is normal . 
  i live in princeton , which is a smallish town in new jersey . 
  people are very nice and polite . 
  wintertime , even the people who are swiping the snow from the sidewalks , say good morning . 
  the town is quite beautiful , and quite clean ( not a lot of garbage on the ground , but there is some ) . 
  some of the road surfaces can be in awfully bad condition , although some roads have new pavement . 
  all in all , this is a nice place , but i do n't think this is very representative of the rest of america . 
  also , half of the people i have made friends with here , are european or asian . 
   there is a very real cultural rift between the us and europe when it comes to free speech . 
  europe has lately been voting left-wing parties less and less . 
  maybe we will slowly get towards the american level . 
   americans moved to america , after how many years should one change their flair to the us flag ? 
  i 'd rather not to . 
   london [ ... ] there 's more curry shops than beheadings and bombings . 
  i think even one beheading is too much . 
  ** finland ** a member of finnish parliament posted on facebook against * [ censored ] * , and this got huge media attention ( `` how can he say that ?
