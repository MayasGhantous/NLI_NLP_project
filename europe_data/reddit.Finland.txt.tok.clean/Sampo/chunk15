  now , i could remotely understand if you mods remove comments protesting the moderation policy in the immigration megathreads , but i just saw i comment removed in this thread . 
  the comment was only about asking why his some other comment was removed . 
  if moderation-critical comments are removed also in this thread which is about discussing the moderation , that is a bit thick . 
  in my opinion you should try to come to some agreement among you mods , what is acceptable to remove and what is not . 
  not this anarchy , when some mods have very different policy in removing peoples ' comments . 
   we 've had seven megathreads about greece in the last month , and people were happy to use them . 
  the difference is , you were not removing greece-related posts outside of the m\u00ebgathreads . 
  however , comments that purely criticize the moderation policy , and have no political content , can not in any way be interpreted as `` white supremacy '' . 
  ~ ~ if ~ ~ when you also remove that kind of comments , at least you should be honest that white supremacy is not the only thing that is banned here . 
   that 's really not all they do i did n't mean to say there are n't also people with `` nastier '' agendas . 
  but in the present state , as far as i understand , even `` good '' people can get a ban if they comment about the moderation policy in a bit too sarcastic tone . 
   i tend to look up account ages now and if they are really young i tend to wonder whether they are alts , subreddit ban evaders , brigaders and/or sockpuppets maybe ? 
  if people post comments criticizing the moderation policy , it it understandable if they use alts for fear that they will be banned for speaking against the powers that be . 
   singapore is not a democracy in any real sense . 
  but how well does it compare to other east asian countries ? 
  i mean , relatively good can still be bad , but after japan and south korea , which i assume are quite democratic , how well does singapore compare to the rest ? 
   here in germany people still call themselves `` turks '' , `` russians '' , `` italians '' i wonder how much those people feel at home when they visit their native turkey , russia or italy ? 
  i bet the finnish journalist did n't know that [ beer float ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+float&amp;tbm=isch ) means a drink made from beer and ice-cream . 
  then again , i am not sure what would be a short english phrase for `` floating down a river while drinking beer '' . 
   we are mongols i 'd prefer vikingmongols . 
  i am sorry , southern bro , i do n't know what those words mean , and consequently i do n't understand your anger ? 
   should leave space for second person in bus a second person per bus makes it too crowded ^ / s, 
   minister of interior visited the camp and told the illegals that they have to obey czech laws . 
  just like [ in sweden ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b1lvpcaigaaozxq.png ) .

  also in french usa is etats unis , so eu . 
  maybe the decision was made in the parliament last year , and now the law is enacted ? 
  at least that 's the impression i got after reading the first 5 words of the article . 
  not that anyone cares , but archive.is has banned finland , so people from finnish ip 's would not see those . 
   rotten fish it is * fermented * , not rotten . 
  totally different process . 
  ^ we ^ do n't ^ even ^ have ^ surstr\u00f6mming ^ in ^ finland, 
  to you . 
   why put serbian , croatian and bosnian as different languages ? 
  they 're not . 
  what about we let serbians , croatians and bosnians decide about that ? 
  maybe we should even make a m\u00ebgathread ? 
  when swiss army enters another country , are they considered immigrants ? 
  does a foreign submarine count as an immigrant ? 
   i might actually buy american other than tesla ? 
  i have heard the us hospitals give you substantial discounts , if you pay in cash , instead of your insurance company paying . 
  and popping some champagne ? 
  inb4 self-driving cars take all programming jobs . 
   perhaps this is no longer newsworthy but rather the new normal . 
  so we should post news whenever there is a week in malm\u00f6 * without * a grenade attack . 
   it became impossible due to the echo chamber mentality of the new demographics of this subreddit . 
  damn immigrants . 
  keep / r/europe pure !, 
   germans have huge amounts of savings . 
  you know , banks do n't actually have your savings money in their vaults . 
  the banks invest them , and in a lot of cases outside of germany ( e.g. 
  greece , as we have learned ) . 
  and the value of those investments would not necessary go up with the new deutchmark going up . 
  what has iceland ever done to you ? 
  ( except that one thing with icelandic banks . ), 
  so they will end in northern scotland ? 
  these people are already in france . 
  why do they see england as their promised land , instead of settling in france ? 
  are the orange shirts somehow related to the king ? 
   which either means that a ) she 's really bad at her job , or b ) there 's a huge amount of self-censorship going on . 
  or both . 
  would it be so bad if they were fully independent and fully outside eu ? 
  you know , a lot of people do n't realize it , but [ america is actually very large ] ( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/ncblgol ) when you compare it to all the other continents . 
   and for public transport without oyster card so get an oyster card ? 
  well , at least on a bike , it is a very nice ride by the sea shore , nice sceneries . 
  the statue itself may not be much , but the way there is nice . 
  at least there is an almost equality in the level of sluttiness in german men and women . 
   what is the anatomical function of the foreskin ? 
  given that you seem unable to check from wikipedia , i need to ask : what is the anatomical function of your brain ? 
  are you saying that only the minority of the professionals suck dick ? 
   opinions should not be downvoted . 
  not even stupid-ass opinions ? 
   you can not simply resolve by declaring that the right you do n't care about is less important . 
  i think that is actually the only way to resolve it . 
  democratically decide and declare what is more important , and that 's it then . 
  spotted an sjw, 
  [ in sweden , it is forbidden by law to be a criminal ] ( http://2nerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/its-illegal-to-be-a-criminal-in-sweden.png ), 
   disposable household income for switzerland at $ 33,491 , as opposed to $ 41,335 for the us . 
  in the us you need to pay for your health insurance , and save money for your pension and your kids ' education . 
  after you have paid for those , how much is left of the $ 41,335 , and how does that compare to the swiss $ 33,491 ? 
   german and french banks that held greece 's previous loans before dumping it on the eu taxpayers you know , i can almost understand the french and german politicians wanting to get all of the eurozone to pay for the mistakes of french and german banks , instead of france and germany saving their banks on their own . 
   we gave money to irish banks but still , irish banks fucked up , so irish people paid . 
  maybe that was a bad decision , maybe you should have let your banking system collapse . 
  or maybe that was a good decision . 
  not really my business to tell you how to handle irish internal politics but i 'd still say that was a different situation , irish people paying for irish banks , than finnish/italian/irish / everyone paying for greek government paying to french and german banks . 
   finland gave a loan not a gift are you seriously expecting that it will be paid back ? 
   ireland paid 16 billion + interest to bailout unsecured bond holders in our banks that is not a bad point , but you ( irish ) gave money to irish banks . 
  we are giving money to somewhere else than finnish banks . 
  nokia had [ 770 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_770_internet_tablet ) in 2005 and [ n800 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n800 ) in 2007 . 
  they were produced by a small department , and the department was not allowed to put cell phone radios on those gadgets , because the department producing symbian phones was much larger , and did n't want the internal competition . 
  of course that n800 is butt ugly compared to the first iphone . 
  but nokia had the technology , they just had bad management , and lost it all . 
  please do . 
  we would love to sell you some cheap alcohol . 
   nokia did n't release a single product which truly competed with the iphone or android software . 
   the only section of the market that is growing globally is toilet paper . 
  yeah , but there was a point in time when the best profit margins were in the fancy , glossy , magazine paper . 
  so that was what the finnish paper industry concentrated on , and the cheapo toilet paper machines they outsourced to asia ... 
  yeah , iphone killed nokia and ipad killed paper ...
