  finland has two expensive finnish supermarket chains that dominate , and lidl has about 8 % market share ( rising about 1 % per year ) . 
  lidl in finland also realized , they do n't need to set very cheap prices , just about 20 % cheaper than the finnish chains . 
  more lidl and cheaper food to finland , bitte sch\u00f6n . 
   why do you keep voting in parties that make your lives more miserable ? 
  not very responsible yes , you should vote for parties that promise to make everyone rich by taking a lot of national debt . 
  that would be responsible . 
   i think she 's gone too far this time in terms of cracking the whip . 
  if uk was in the eurozone , you would have been more lenient in giving greece more money ? 
  have you seen [ kung fury ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bs5p_laqivg ) ? 
   why not blame your leaders finland is a small country with a long border with russia . 
  we want to stay friends with the big european countries ( and also with usa ) in case we some day need some sympathy . 
  so if germany and france decide we pay , then we pay . 
   why are you paying to bail out foreign banks in addition to above , if we did n't help greece to bail out the loans they are currently unable to pay , greece would default and their situation would get even worse . 
  it is not nice that finland ends up contributing approx . 
  1000 $ per person ( in total , starting from 2010 bailout ) , because people could use that money at home . 
  but if that helps prevent chaos in greece , maybe there is this positive side to it . 
  it was mostly french and german banks . 
  i guess france and germany prefer that every country in the eurozone pays , instead of only france and germany paying to bail out their own banks . 
  or , if you are asking , why to bail out banks in general , i do n't know , but usa did that too in 2008 , so maybe for the same reason . 
  or if you are asking why finland agrees to whatever germany and france tell us to do , finland is too small to have the courage to disagree . 
   when 89 % go to the banks , do n't talk about how much money i get . 
  would you think that it would be better if the eu would not give greece that money , which then goes to banks ? 
  there already was * [ first economic adjustment programme for greece ( 2010 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_economic_adjustment_programme_for_greece ) * [ second economic adjustment programme for greece ( 2012 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_economic_adjustment_programme_for_greece ) and now 2015 is the third . 
   i blame it on the eu how much money would you want to get , so that you would not blame anybody ? 
   for example , if you export a lot outside the eu and the euro is very strong , that will hurt you more in theory , a whole country could agree to lower peoples ' salaries , which would achieve the same goal as currency devaluation . 
  in practice , such an agreement is more difficult for the politicians to do , than to simply decide about devaluation . 
   the ship is already sinking . 
  there will be more ships . 
   failing to find any acceptable solutions to the problem maybe there are no solutions to the problem , that would be generally acceptable . 
  after some googling ... yes , it seems to be a thing . 
   the weakening of france compared to germany is bad news . 
  the next time russia flexes its muscles , we 'll just be happy if we have strong germany . 
  if you are hoping to borrow another 50 euros from him , better not to tell him fuck you . 
   raw sticks of butter is it possible to cook a stick of butter ? 
   such drama . 
  many politics !, 
   it wo n't get greece out of the hole . 
  do you have a recipe that would ? 
  ( does anyone ? ), 
   slovenia , latvia , estonia and lithuania who are considerably poorer than greece already . 
  and also finland . 
  we are not ( yet anyway ) poorer than greece . 
  some people want more tight european union , and some people want less european union . 
  people in every eu country are divided on this question . 
   are you 12 years old ? 
  and even if you are , do n't tell that to any / u/catholic _ extremist, 
  who 's to say they could not create a union by taking over one country at a time ? 
   can actually pay it back username checks out , / u/cluelessperson, 
   i 'm a federalist , but this is honestly making me doubt the eu , it 's a hostile takeover of a country was n't the point of the union to take political power away from individual countries , to the eu ? 
   but it 's worth keeping in mind who decides what that fiscal policy is . 
  well , it has to start with small steps ? 
   finland 's economy is suffering because they have to use the euro the euro has prevented finland to simply use currency devaluation to improve economic competitiveness . 
  but germany achieved the same by freezing or even decreasing people 's salaries . 
  finland 's previous government did n't do this ( or much anything ) because the were the most inefficient government in finnish history , but the current government is trying to do this . 
  who know , maybe they 'll even succeed . 
  maybe i am reading wrong what people have been writing in this thread , but as far as i have understood , they want transfer union without the common fiscal policy part . 
  ( `` give us more money , but do n't tell us how to spend it . '' ), 
   germany would end up subsidizing greece and co. under such an arrangement , and they absolutely do n't want that . 
  and countries would surrender a part of their sovereign decision making to the eu . 
  but this whole thread is about how , when it is suggested that greece surrenders some , people are against that . 
   a transfer union like the us a transfer union with unified fiscal policy . 
  and now that a unified fiscal policy is suggested to greece , everybody loses their minds . 
  a transfer union without unified fiscal policy will not work . 
  no , a common fiscal policy , like in the usa . 
   fiscal transfers fiscal transfers alone will not suffice , there needs to be a common fiscal policy . 
  this means individual countries surrendering their fiscal policy to the eu . 
   all i got from this was they set fire to a castle ? 
  that sounds kind of awesome honestly how did you feel about the 9/11 ? 
   so if someone burned down the statue of liberty or , you know , the wtc ... 
   latvia to me is just some old ex-soviet republic that is not a very nice thing to say . 
  they are a nice country , fast improving their economy and quality of life , and it is somewhat rude to label them based on their unfortunate history . 
  he 's not racist , he just dislikes people who steal copper wires . 
   helena eronen i do n't think helena eronen has ever belonged to the perussuomalaiset party . 
  i was trying to say i checked the first two quotes , and those people did n't get elected . 
  not even close . 
  [ gypsy child thieves ( bbc documentary ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thinoddvvmq ), 
   would you say those views are typical of members of the party ? 
  the party has grown so fast , and has lots of internal disagreements , so it 's not so easy to even find out what are the typical members of the party . 
   is this site real or trolling ? 
  truefinns quotes probably real . 
  but those quotes are from people from small towns who are `` politicians '' only in the sense that they were running ( not necessarily got elected ) to their town councils . 
  for example the [ guy from the first quote ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_elovaara ) ran in the parliament elections in 2007 and got a whopping 126 votes ( a tiny amount , really ) , and was kicked out of the party in 2011 . 
  the second quote is from someone who was running for a town council of a [ small town of 25 000 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sastamala ) and [ did n't get elected ] ( http://www.sastamalankaupunki.fi/sivu.tmpl?sivu_id=6840 ) . 
  i am sure each country has their share of this kind of fringe politicians . 
  here is some less radical news , minister of finance [ alexander stubb says ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/stubb_kreikka_ei_ole_saamassa_lisalainaa__toimet_eivat_riita/8148807 ) that ( a ) finland is not the only country that is not wanting to give more money to greece , and ( b ) the government is not about to collapse . 
  the news about this situation change so quickly , it is difficult to know what to believe . 
   i was 14 back then and i didnt even know why my parents and i have to suffer for things we arent responsible for . 
  i want to thank you for giving your perspective . 
  however , you need to realize , that [ greece has been living on other countries ' money ] ( http://financemymoney.com/greece-debt-to-gdp-ratio-200-percent-the-crisis-is-of-solvency-and-not-liquidity/ ) basically from 1980 onwards . 
  you are not responsible for this situation , but also the other people in other countries that have been giving you money for last 25 years , are not responsible . 
  they are not obliged to continue giving you money , and if they decide to stop giving you money , you just have to deal with it , and start living at a rate you can afford . 
   they want us to suffer , to lower our standard of life they do n't want you to suffer , they just want to stop giving you money . 
  it 's their money and they want to use it themselves . 
  just like you would . 
  it is a sad situation that your standard of life has been build upon borrowed money for 25 years . 
  and it is sad that your politicians and your media has lied to you about this . 
  but you can not keep on living on borrowed money forever . 
  i do n't think offers from russia were ever beneficial to anyone , except maybe russia . 
   a lot of hate from finland we lost nokia and our economy is not doing very well , and our new goverment is trying to reduce taking new debt , so people are afraid that the quality of life is going down . 
  so the idea of giving money to someone else , when we feel that we are ourselves running out of money , is not popular .
