   finland 62 according to [ finnish wikipedia ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/el%c3%a4ke#suomessa ) it was 63-68 , but in 2014 the lower limit was changed to 65 . 
   retirement age was raised by a decade which age was it before , and to what age was it raised ? 
   did you read any of the sources ? 
  i clicked on the last 2 , but they were paywalled ... so in effect , no . 
  i think greece momentarily had a primary surplus in 2014 , but not anymore . 
  also some bars in denmark do n't take cards . 
   first of all , those 15 billion are hardly a gift . 
  they 're a loan . 
  well , there are various opinions , on how probable it is that greece would , or would not , ever pay it back . 
  anybody can make a guess . 
   austerity is not working . 
  also continuously borrowing over your capacity , can be a somewhat risky strategy . 
   i think it would be right to give greece ( and portugal for that matter ) a bit of time to grow but that would mean continuing to give them 15 billion euros per year . 
  who wants to pay for those 15 billion ? 
   you do realise [ ... ] that those stats are taking into account the top 1 percent . 
  yes , and i said that ( `` average salary does n't tell anything about the distribution '' ) , but they take into account the 1 % equally also in poland . 
   id kill for 500 bucks a month [ united nations 2011 statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage#unece_2011_statistics ) gives average monthly salary as $ 2245 for greece and $ 1753 for poland . 
  so 28 % higher for greece than poland . 
  now , average salary does n't tell anything about the distribution . 
  perhaps greece has a minority of people with very high salaries , and a majority of people with salaries much lower than the average . 
  but that is your problem , and it is not the problem of the polish people . 
  unless you are saying that you can not handle your own country ? 
  are you asking outside help to surrender your sovereignty to an outside power ? 
  would you rather let a polish government to rule greece to fix your problems ? 
   yeah the number of personal attacks is not really comfortable . 
  i got called by an italian redditor a lazy useless cunt that stole the money from his country while tax evading . 
  i think there is a deep difference in how people view things . 
  to some people ( ant not just greeks ) , `` austerity does not work , stop austerity '' is a perfecly valid opinion . 
  to others it reads `` give us more money '' . 
  and because they do n't feel they owe greece any money , they find it offensive . 
   the idea is that a crisis may force eu to rethink it 's approach on these matters . 
  or , everyone will have a different idea on how we should react the the crisis , and we just quarrel more , and become less united . 
   people keep asking for receipts in order to have chance of winning stuff like cars wow that is * genius * . 
  but what 's the point of paying taxes is the money goes to a corrupt government ? 
    the only things that stays constant is that they 're victims and they do n't want to pay their debt . 
   why should they ? 
  if they stop paying their debt , they should not be surprised if others stop giving them new loans . 
  and the one constant in this has been that greece is all the time asking for new loans . 
  different political parties in greece may want different things , but all of them want to loan more money . 
   reddit and its employees have become completely disconnected from the community as a whole what about one / r/europe mod having become disconnected from the / r/europe commmunity ? 
   what the banks have done should be discussed much more openly on here . 
  yes , if the banks had not given debt to greece 10-15 years ago , this could have been avoided . 
   but they managed to spin it so that greeks are at fault well greece is at fault for taking a debt that they can not pay back . 
   letting rogue submarines and jets continue entering our territory it 's not like they do n't have [ a plan ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/11603383/swedish-underwater-gay-sailor-to-scare-off-russian-submarines.html ) in sweden . 
  or submarines . 
  what is a cross thumper ? 
  ( a [ google search ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=cross+thumper ) did n't help . ), 
   europe is perfectly capable of defending itself without america . 
  i do n't think the baltic countries , or poland , believe this . 
   what exactly is so fucked up with the american election system ? 
  choosing only one representative from each electoral district , a.k.a. 
  `` winner takes it all '' is very stupid system . 
  so you are saying , eu should just keep on giving money to greece ? 
   with the money that is being lent . 
  but who wants to lend money to greece anymore ? 
  ( except the imf . ), 
   greece paid it back over 20 years . 
  nobody believes greece could pay it back anymore . 
  `` yay '', 
   nobody is bashing / u/matrysylva for daring to submit a non-english speaking link ? 
  you can post non-english links as long as you do n't do it in a douche manner . 
  estonia can not into nordic , apparently, 
  i think there are countries in south america that have defaulted several times . 
  after a while , someone has always been happy to give new loans . 
  at least people in dc have the political power to dictate that gays can marry in mississippi . 
   why ca n't we ( eu ) bail out greece and end this ? 
  we would then probably need to bail out greece again and again in the future . 
   mandatory does any eu country currently have mandatory vaccinations ? 
   it destroys the thread . 
  so you do n't like it when other people have different opinions than you ? 
   do you consider baltics and russia third world ? 
  i think russia is by definition [ second world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_world ) . 
  baltics , this is a more difficult question , maybe 2.5 world ? 
  usa is taking approx . 
  [ 1 million immigrants per year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_the_united_states ) . 
   israel should not exist that sounds a bit anti-semite . 
  0.16 % of people in finland have swedish citizenship . 
  5.2 % of people have their first language as swedish . 
  ( in case of bilingual people , sometimes it is a bit random which language they report as their first language . ), 
  if swedes move to finland , they probably get immersed into the fennoswede culture quickly and easily , because of the shared language ( although very different dialect ) , and when they have kids , it would be very difficult to say if the kids should be thought of as second generation swedish immigrants , or fully assimilated fennoswedes . 
   commie czechoslovakia was an important supporter of j\u00e1sir arafat and his party finland sold wood tar which was used for waterproofing the ships used in the atlantic slave trade . 
  we are also very guilty . 
  we want to be guilty . 
  please let us be guilty . 
  they actually did a study to correct for socio-economic background and age : http://i.imgur.com/yd3gwvv.png the comparison is to finnish base level = 1 . 
  dark blue bar = actual level . 
  light blue bar = corrected for age . 
  yellow bar = corrected for age and income . 
  grey bar = corrected for age , income and location of residency . 
  correcting for socio-economic background and age , brings the level of north africa + middle east rape crime from 17.57 down to 12.90 , as compared to finnish base level of 1 . 
  can you give some links to the studies where your information is from ? 
   it feels good to be in the middle . 
  you centrist fuck !, 
   why not just have the rapist marry her which one of the rapists ? 
  i just wanted to clarify to / u/clorst _ glornk that , to a certain level , italy is already doing what she/he suggested . 
  but it might improve employment rate . 
   you ca n't physically make the continent a fortress well you can [ try ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_wall_of_china ) . 
  yeah , if we just had supported saddam and gaddafi and al-assad , like europeans have always wanted , we would not have these problems . 
  except usa . 
   contain illegal immigration but that containing would mean doing what australia does , which would mean to return the ships back to africa by force .
