  it has worked in australia , and people are not drowning in australian waters anymore . 
  but i do n't think there is yet political will to start doing that in europe . 
   it 's time for italy to start giving out free visas and all accommodations possible to let these migrants go straight into the heart of europe well they do n't give visas and accomodation , but they pretty much let them travel across italy in the hope that they will leave to france or germany . 
   refugee bias . 
  so just becoming a refugee makes you a more probable rapist ? 
   there is no unambiguous answer to why this is the case and is yet to be researched . 
  so the question is , why immigrants coming from some countries ( in this case , north africa or middle east ) statistically commit more of certain type of crimes ( in this case , sexual violence ) . 
  everybody knows why , but the answer might not be politically correct . 
   the whole article is about the nationality of the rapists . 
  did it matter , to begin with ? 
  the way i see this , they got a very typical sentence for the type of crime they did , so race did not seem to be an issue in the sentence . 
  it it very normal in finland that rapists get relatively mild sentences , and people frequently get infuriated about this . 
  so nothing unusual here . 
   that is not what i am reading here , nor what the article has reported . 
  the article is subjective . 
  the way i see this , people are mostly angry about the mild sentence , not racial issues . 
   would a finnish group of men with the same characteristics end in jail for the same thing ? 
  this topic has been a lot in the news lately , and i recall one newspaper article claimed that about 50 % or `` normal '' rapes ( normal as in e.g. 
  was not kidnapped for several days , or there was no cutting or breaking bones etc. ), 
  end up sentenced with jail time , others get [ conditional discharge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discharge_%28sentence%29 ) . 
   they 're all jailed not true . 
  3 out of 5 of them got a [ conditional discharge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discharge_%28sentence%29 ) for approx . 
  1 year , and 2 got nothing . 
   every single muslim unhappy with mohammed caricatures personally used a bomb there is about 1.5 billion muslims in the world . 
  if what you say was true and every one of them had used a bomb , that would mean 1.5 billion bombs . 
  not very plausible . 
   part of freedom of speech is being allowed to criticize others speech . 
  as long as the criticism is not expressed in the form of bombs . 
   this is some opressive , communist loonacy . 
  and look what this lunacy has done to us , and to sweden , norway and denmark . 
  if you want to put the proposal into perspective , you have to compare it to the current system in finland . 
  ( which you seem to know nothing about . ), 
  then you would realize that it would be an improvement actually . 
   still i ca n't see a reason to give money for nothing . 
  yes , but this is how we have run our country at least since the 1980s , giving money for nothing . 
  we are not going to stop now . 
  welcome, 
   the money do n't grow on trees , you know ? 
  maybe in poland it does n't . 
  if finland it pretty much seems to . 
   maybe in finnland the original link was about finland , you may not have noticed ? 
    basic income encourages work more than the current welfare system does . 
   how ? 
  in our current system , if you find a part-time or short term job , you may lose all your benefits , and thus you 'd be taking a financial loss . 
  so the people who are living on the benefits are very much discouraged to accept anything else than a full-time job with a salary of at least ca . 
  1200-1500 $ / month . 
  accepting anything worse makes no sense , financially . 
  so our current system has these weak points , which basic income would correct . 
  every time someone has brought me russian chocolate , that has not been not very good chocolate . 
   giving money for nothing is not just demoralising we already give money for nothing , that would just be reorganizing how we give it . 
   jesus , who liked to rape ill kids [ citation needed ], 
   here where ? 
  just leave your tiny coins home . 
  til : some countries still use 1c and 2c coins : - o, 
  please do n't leave us . 
  we 're too shortsighted to get by on our own . 
   big strong countries - are hated also some big not-anymore-so-strong countries are hated . 
  i once rode on a camel in turkey, 
   then why are other eu countries reducing their unemployment which countries ? 
  we have no polar bears . 
  at least not in the streets of helsinki . 
  at least not summertime . 
   we have ban on abortion err ... what ? 
  he is not racist , he prefers educated immigrants over non-educated , so the key is the level of education , not race . 
  you could call him elitist , perhaps . 
  well , countries outside of british isles pretty much did n't have the whole concept of irish travellers , so ` gypsy ' and ` roma ' are synonymous everywhere else except the british isles . 
  but also other european countries , not just eastern european countries , have had gypsy ( the non-irish kind ) populations for hundreds of years , so ` roma ' doe n't mean only roma/romani/gypsy people from eastern europe . 
  you call the [ irish travellers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) gypsies ? 
  so [ you would send ] ( http://acharts.us/us_albums_top_100 ) ... mumford & sons , a british rock band from london ? 
   i thought roma meant gypsy from romania . 
  it now seems it means gypsy from eastern/central europe . 
  all gypsies are roma : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people, 
   we would win this shit so easily . 
  it 's not that you do n't have a lot of good music , but you would need to set up a process to decide who to send as your representative . 
  and what kind of artist would come out through the selection process ? 
  someone 's been playing the eurovision drinking game . 
  in lithuania [ they know how to stop illegal parking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq-8xj8cuzw ), 
   i hate our beers as well . 
  [ keisari 66 ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/nokian-keisari-66/204704/ ) was a nice american pale ale , made in finland . 
  it got popular quickly , and [ the brewery had quality problems all through 2014 ] ( http://www.reittausblogi.info/2014/07/keisari-66-ja-laatuongelmat.html ) , but hopefully they are getting their shit together . 
   the us is not exactly picking up any slack though   http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/19/refugees-unhcr-statistics-data   taking in the same absolute numbers as the uk i think in usa their definition of immigration is broader than just taking in refugees . 
  polish is between czech and slovak ?? 
  but can we ? 
   i would n't say that 's much of an accomplishment . 
  it for us . 
  that 's borderline racist . 
  it is time germany updated internet speed to eastern european level , do n't you think ? 
   sweden seem to have a lot of universities for a country with such a small population . 
  most of the vocational schools and local colleges have changed their english name to contain `` university '' . 
  but their swedish names are not `` university '' and nobody in sweden considers them to be universities . 
  they are the same people who were pro-soviet union at the time when the soviet union still existed . 
  i guess they got stuck to their way of thinking `` east good , west bad '' , and although the east has changed , these people can not change their thinking . 
   russia and socialism in the same sentence is one huge error at the current time . 
  yes , but we still have some old-school leftists , who still defend almost anything russia does . 
  how could we tell your message to them ? 
  we need help to explain to our own leftists , why socialism and/or russia are not such great things . 
  some level-headed estonians could explain these things in a more believable manner than we can .
