   because there 's absolutely no quantifiable measure of `` good culture '' . 
  i think if people are trying to emigrate from country a to country b , we can infer that a is better , even in the eyes of b people . 
   different shades of red or the images are scanned by different scanners . 
   vice president of the german parliament , claudia roth of the green party [ ... ] said :   * `` the violent clashes between kurdish and islamist groups in german cities and on german streets refer more to internal german problems than the situation in northern syria and northern iraq . 
  '' * her viewpoint is very difficult to understand . 
   then fuck equality . 
  this is why estonia can not into nordic . 
  as far as i know , france is secular state . 
  but nordic countries have a state church ( well i am not sure about sweden , but the other 4 do ) . 
  thus our law dictates certain things about the church . 
  but still the church has a lot of independence and can have more conservative opinions than our parliament . 
  almost the same line that was during the cold war . 
  just , czech , slovenia and ( soon ) estonia have jumped over to west . 
  steve jobs was a genius , and apple really understands ui and design . 
  but there a other us companies , say microsoft and motorola , that do n't understand sleek design like apple does . 
  so superior design is an apple thing but not a general us thing . 
  also , there are some finnish products , at least the angry birds games , that are quite sleek and have very smooth ui that a 4-year old can learn in an instant . 
  so it 's not that everything in finland is clumsy engineering design . 
  also , before the smartphones era , from 1995 to ca . 
  2000 , microsoft pretty much ruled in desktop computers , apple had under 10 % market share . 
  also then apple had much better design , and windows pc 's were clumsy and not stylish . 
  but they were cheaper and had better tech specs . 
  so it 's not that sleek design is always the winning recipe . 
  so we have a new a criterion for separating eastern and western europe, 
   very interesting , but also very long . 
  i agree , very interesting . 
  also quite bad english . 
  population is also moving away from the countryside . 
  most people want to live in cities ( though not everybody , just most ) . 
  so it is kind of natural that services disappear when the population decreases below a certain level . 
  i want to cry . 
  in finland , a 0.5 litre bottle of urquell in a shop : 2.80 $ . 
  in germany : 0.95 $ . 
  life is not fair . 
   we have to stop austerity we have austerity ? 
  [ `` in recent years , various experiments have shown that grammatical genders can shape the feelings and associations of speakers toward objects around them . 
  '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html?pagewanted=all ) also some original research articles : [ grammatical gender affects bilinguals ' conceptual gender : implications for linguistic relativity and decision making ] ( http://benthamopen.com/toalj/articles/v001/68toalj.pdf ) and [ unconscious effects of grammatical gender during object categorisation ] ( http://www.academia.edu/1922545/unconscious_effects_of_grammatical_gender_during_object_categorisation ) i am sure there are more , i just found these by a quick googling . 
  actually bad translation . 
  the original `` ja jos t\u00e4t\u00e4 kielien kirjoa ei olisi '' means : `` and if this language diversity did not exist '' , not `` and if there were no books in this language '' . 
  so the blame is on the translator , lola rogers , who seems to have done a sloppy job . 
  especially the water taps are annoying . 
   the unclos is very specific that if you hear a distress call as a coastal state , and you have the power to help a vessel in distress , you have to go do it those rules were written at a time when vessels were not routinely putting themselves at a distress . 
  [ come back , colonialism , all is forgiven ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713275,00.html ), 
  you mean stiffs like you get to decide , then ? 
   that was written horrible * horribly * there is also e.g. 
  a [ snopes article ] ( http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp ) . 
  homophobic society does n't sound very open to me . 
  i had previously thought that the eastern europe wanted to be like the west , but homophobia is a pretty strong signal that they do n't . 
   if you cant follow silly small arbitrary rules http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232420, 
  after russia started to be openly homophobic , and we do n't want to be like russia . 
  just joking , this is not how it historically went in finland . 
  but i really wonder why former east european countries do want to be like russia . 
   because the status quo is not a long-term solution i wonder if middle-east has had any long term solution for the last 2000 years . 
  they said :  basque , hungarian , finnish , ** sami ** , and crimean tatar, 
  i am a native speaker of finnish . 
  i have never studied estonian . 
  estonian and finnish have very similar grammar , and lots of common words , or words that are so similar that it is possible to guess what they mean . 
  i took a [ random article from estonian wikipedia ] ( http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/abessiinia_kass ) and i can understand 80 % -- 90 % of the words . 
  but it actually quite often happens that a word that is strange to me , is the key word for understanding the full meaning of a sentence , so it follows that i can fully understand only 60 % -70 % of the sentences . 
  in any kind of more complicated text , i could easily tell what it is about , and pick out some sentences that i fully understand , but a full understanding of a more complicated document would not be possible . 
  i can read swedish , and now that i tried to read the danish wikipedia i have to say that reading danish is a little bit easier , for me , than reading estonian . 
  there are a little bit less unfamiliar words , and especially they tend to less often be the key words for understanding the sentence . 
  but i just have had 6 years of swedish at school , and not a lot of practice . 
  so if even for me reading danish is this easy , then it must be even easier for a native speaker of swedish . 
  maybe we could then call the countries ukraine and north-ukraine ( ex-russia ) . 
  maybe those councils could hold a vote to become independent from scotland . 
  it 's not that scotland has an army to stop them ( at the moment ) . 
  and then join uk . 
  but the amount of votes in the whole scotland still counts ? 
  guardian has a page following online as the results come in : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2014/sep/18/-sp-scottish-independence-referendum-results-in-full edit : bbc has too , a bit less fancy graphics : http://www.bbc.com/news/events/scotland-decides/results, 
  the reasons you gave , could also be used to defend a one-party system , do n't you think ? 
   last time i checked braveheart was one of the most historically inacurate hollywood movies ever made ... 
  whereas e.g. 
  the highest-grossing hollowood movie ever , ** avatar ** , was relatively accurate . 
   everyone loves estonia . 
  everyone loves scotland .

  i do love estonia . 
  you will always have 1 out of the 2 parties governing your country . 
  if the population wants change but the 2 big parties do n't , your only option is to work from within those 2 parties . 
  in a [ proportional repsesentation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proportional_representation ) , the constitution of the parliament would more closely represent the prevailing opinions of the people . 
  it 's also much easier to establish new political parties and those have a realistic chance to get elected into the parliament if there is at least ca . 
  3-5 % support for them in the general population . 
  ( the proportional system can also run into problems , when the multitude of the parties can not find a way to cooperate with each other , which we might see now in sweden . 
  or maybe they will find an agreement there . ), 
   there will be calls to change the voting system that would be good . 
  your [ first-past-the-post ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) is moronic and i think it really hurts you . 
   it just feels both wrong and extremely pretentious when your frame of reference is a language which uses genered pronouns . 
  also the gendered languages feel weird , and kind of wrong , when coming from a non-gendered language . 
  btw , [ seems like ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_pronouns#overview_of_pronouns ) korean was traditionally non-gendered , but because of english influence , they are introducing gendered versions , too . 
  what does this direction reek to you ? 
   99 % of the social control can be exercised anyway . 
  in real , truly secret voting , it can not . 
  in a system that almost every fucking country has , except sweden . 
   i got ballots for every major party in the mail about a week before the election . 
  what about if someone wants to vote for a small party ? 
  and the small party may not have a lot of money . 
  if you order the ballots by mail , is the the party who has to pay the postage to mail their ballot to you ? 
  you have absolutely no idea how other countries manage to do it , do you ? 
  i do n't think anyone can know how much it influences the results .
