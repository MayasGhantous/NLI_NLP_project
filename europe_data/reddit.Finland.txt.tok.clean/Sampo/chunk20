  it would be nice if the national debt did not increase by 5 % or 6 % each year . 
  not having russia as a neighbor . 
   but independent catalonia can not survive if eu countries would not recognize it . 
  i would recognize it . 
   if it happens without the consent of the central government you 're still bitter about norway declaring independence in 1814 , are n't you ? 
  much better than the old one . 
  moving your abba mp3 's to recycle bin does n't really have the same ring to it . 
  he should have said semitic world . 
  probably sweden also has plenty of other countries to sell weapons to . 
   `` my pool is so much bigger than this one '' i have said that about a sauna . 
  when i started to read / r/europe, 
  eating with knife in right hand and fork in left . 
  i do n't think the demand goes down when a city grows . 
  think of london , new york or tokio . 
  was there ever a point on their growth curve when demand went down ? 
  or you could buy a boat . 
  she/he probably already does . 
   attention whores like no one else in eurovision ever was . 
   their song sucks badly i do n't know about your country , but at least in finland there has been a lot of hc punk bands whose musics [ sucks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozkfn9xpod4 ) [ equally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkaboqbqobu ) [ much ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71kchtzblfs ) . 
  wow , you are like a european version of a redneck , making ignorant prejudicious jokes about faraway countries . 
   they 're screaming for bike roads and extra bike lanes in the capital , the problem is there 's literally no place to put them . 
  have you ever been to copenhagen ? 
  they have wonderful bike lanes there . 
  is your capital city more densely built than copenhagen ? 
   no restaurants does nordic cuisine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noma_%28restaurant%29, 
   nordics can not into food actually , the [ best restaurant in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world's_50_best_restaurants#best_restaurants_by_year ) in years 2010 , 2011 , 2012 and 2014 was [ in denmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noma_%28restaurant%29 ) . 
  like you already conquered america . 
   nato is like an insurance policy . 
  except insurance will not cover if russia declares war and destroys your house . 
   cornered animal will attack in desperation . 
  and non-cornered will attack with preparation . 
   what i do n't understand is why turkey is so opposed to calling it genocide . 
  i have seen some comments in reddit claiming that pre-1950s it was not such a sore topic , and that atat\u00fcrk himself acknowledged that it happened . 
  but that in the 1950s the soviet union used it as a stepping stone to lay some claims to land areas in eastern turkey , and that this is when turkey went on full defensive/denial . 
  i have not verified this , just something i have read in some reddit comments . 
  but at least this should give you some keywords to google about it . 
   also , it 's in german ( the official language in austria ) . 
  however , in germany it 's called [ abitur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abitur ) , not matura . 
   they are basically against every religion that is not islam . 
  and also other sects of islam . 
   these topics are allowed to stay up and are in fact very welcomed by the community , not suppressed . 
  some of them are removed by the mods . 
  some of them get through . 
  if the mods removed everything , the bad blood between users and mods would grow too much , as it occasionally has in the history of this sub . 
   a-level i do n't speak very good british , either , so i had to check wikipedia . 
  so basically a level means high school graduation ? 
  after which you can enter a university . 
  what is this fp\u00d6 ? 
  there is no fp\u00d6 in the [ graph ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zfa1g1i.jpg ) . 
  as far as i understand , `` ohne matura '' are voting for `` hof '' and `` matura und h\u00f6her '' are voting for `` vdb '' or `` gri '' . 
   https://i.imgur.com/zfa1g1i.jpg for those of us who do n't read austrian , what does it say ? 
   the only difference between 800 years vs. 50-60 years is a big difference , though . 
  hmm , was n't it at least last year that anything critical of immigration was banned from / r/sweden ? 
  how , when did this change about ? 
  is that meant to encourage or discourage britain from leaving ? 
   / r/ireland is purely about ireland . 
  2rd from top post in / r/ireland at the moment : [ / r/ireland u.s presidential primary survey ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/4fj0zx/rireland_us_presidential_primary_survey/ ), 
  i am just hoping , in a couple of decades ukraine could have a similar quick economic development as estonia did . 
  then the prosperous state would not only be an ex-ussr state , but also almost russian speaking ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ukrainians . 
  russians can not understand estonian tv and newspapers , but they can understand ukrainian media . 
  then they will really wee how well others are doing . 
   40000 dead is a big number it was about 1.3 % of the population . 
  but a couple of decades later , the spanish managed to kill about 2 % of themselves in their civil war . 
  multiculturalism probably works just fine , as long as mena is not involved . 
   western europe ( generally ) just does n't like the usa and never will not so simple . 
  the european left dislikes usa , but on the political right there is also lot of usa admiring going on . 
  you should not let the political left to be the only voice you hear . 
   do you think protecting your country benefits americans at all ? 
  this is a complicated issue . 
  in ww2 , it made sense for america to help europe defend against nazi-germany . 
  if the nazi-germany would have conquered europe , they would have eventually attacked usa , too . 
  better to crush the enemy early than let it grow stronger . 
  the same went on in the cold war , letting the soviet union grow too strong , they would have started to attack america , directly or indirectly . 
  but perhaps usa could mold russia into something like saudi-arabia is . 
  let some corrupt elite get filthy rich by pimping their country 's natural resources to americans , and the elite is probably happy to keep their country 's general population in control and in a relatively fucked up state . 
  so , i do n't know , whether freedom and democracy or corruption and collusion makes more business sense ? 
  what do you think ? 
   he is pretty isolationist i think isolationist usa is what the european left has always wanted . 
  so why do n't they like trump ? 
  * `` according to bruckner , leftist adherents of third-worldism hope to use islamism as a `` battering-ram '' to bring about the downfall of free-market capitalism , and they see the sacrifice of individual rights - in particular , of women 's rights - as an acceptable trade-off in service of the greater goal of destroying capitalism . 
  '' * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamo-leftism this has happened before , at least in the [ 1970s in iran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leftist_guerrilla_groups_of_iran ) when marxist and islamist movements joined forces to oust the pro-western dictator . 
  did n't go well for the marxists afterwards . 
   swede n't did n't have any colonies . 
  neither did finland sweden had finland . 
   this never really being a core value for most europeans the thought-policing european left is very loud and vocal , but they are not the majority , and they are slowly losing political support . 
  roads were even worse in philadelphia ( pennsylvania ) and in staten island ( new york ) . 
   forcing a brotherly nation and a long-time part of the country to openly choose between us and the eu who in their right minds would not choose eu over russia any day ? 
   i always hear about the shitty infrastructure in the us . 
  i live in new jersey . 
  roads are in shitty condition . 
   we ca n't expect the us to do so much in our own continent can we ? 
  at the moment i have more trust in usa defending europe , than europe defending europe . 
   those are a-okay no problem ? 
  those were okay , yes .

   i do n't think mastercard takes those as payment . 
  mastercard sounds so capitalishtik .

   worked well in the past has n't it .
