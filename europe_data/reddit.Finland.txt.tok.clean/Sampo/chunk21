  we have given women peace from harassment for our time . 
  myyrmanni was schoolboy who never published any political agenda . 
  he had a hobby of chemistry , and exploding homemade bombs in a forest . 
  we do n't know if he committed an extended suicide on purpose , or if he was carrying his homemade bomb to later play with it in a forest ( as he had done previously ) and it accidentally exploded in his bag . 
  one theory is that he was a quiet boy , perhaps subject to bullying in school , and just hated all mankind and expressed this by building a bomb . 
  i would not classify this as terrorism . 
  if you fly to norway , finland on a direct flight , or via iceland then yes . 
  but a lot of flight connections would have a stopover in london , amsterdam , paris or some german airport . 
  i guess the solution is to attack molenbeek with soldiers , guns and bombs . 
   this crap happens everyday in the middle-east . 
  so how do the non-terrorist muslims in meddle-east countries response to the terrorists there ? 
   it 's not rocket science guys !, 
  more like bomb science ... 
  we have ` alusta ' for that , too . 
   locally sourced materials and weapons yay for sustainable , locally sourced explosives . 
  ` alus ' = ` ship ' , not ` base ' . 
  but yes , ` alus ' means platform , so i see where you got ` base ' from . 
  also , we have ` lennokki ' , means flying model aircraft . 
   it was not at all clear in the 70s and 80s that communism had `` lost '' . 
  even at that time , you could have observed that it was a much larger number of people trying to escape the eastern/soviet oppression and move to the west . 
  than escape from the west and move to eastern europe . 
  mostly , yes . 
   i 'm guessing all of those deaths from the uk and spain are because of the ira and eta ? 
  [ lockerbie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_am_flight_103 ) in 1988 was actually an islamist attack . 
   those uk deaths are likely from the northern ireland troubles . 
  what do mean likely ? 
  of course they are . 
   i 'm still waiting for the lefties to admit we were right about it being a terrible idea . 
  have they yet even admitted communism was a terrible idea ? 
   somehow i do n't think nuclear powerplants make a great target even if you just detonate a bomb in the general area of a nuclear power plant , even if nowhere near the actual reactors , just imagine what kind of headlines newspapers would write ? 
   special thanks to the us for them supporting the saudis when they 've been funding extremists in europe . 
  if not for the west supporting a strong dictator , saudi arabia could become a similar clusterfuck and failed state as happened to iraq . 
  the failure to keep a strong rule in iraq also gave rise to isis . 
  we should not at the same time blame both the instabilization of iraq , and the attempts to keep saudi arabia stable , for the rise of extremism . 
  damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  perhaps a failed state n saudi arabia could lead to even more terrorism , like people have said about the failure of iraq , than the current saudi regime ? 
   so the mobilization of islam against communism was wide spread and now they reap what they sow . 
  it is difficult to know , how dangerous the communists might have been , if we had not fought against the rise of communism . 
  maybe were are better off with islamists instead of communists . 
  hard to say . 
  are you swedish ? 
   * 1 : easier imprisonment for mentally ill and unstable  * 2 : co2 is a natural element and therefore not harmful at all i am sure none of the afd voters voted them for those reasons . 
   pretty sure greece is worse than romania now , too . 
  at least in romania they can afford 60 tonnes of fried chicken . 
   there needs to be a distinction between the greek and slavic macedonia why ? 
  race should n't matter . 
  does eu count as a higher power ? 
   the paris i 've experienced for the last 10 years is comparatively not that bad at all i assume any european city ( perhaps excluding nordic countries and switzerland ) is filthy compared to japanese cities . 
   when i was there last ( about two years ago ) the city was really dirty and reeked !, 
  maybe it was clean , compared to what the paris city hall spokesman considers normal . 
  is there any data , what percentage of murderer childs have become good citizens ? 
   surely nobody is stupid enough to think this would benefit finland at fucking all ? 
  swedish economy seems to be doing relatively well , without euro . 
  people from all those areas commute and work in new york city . 
  eu needs to get rid of the eu commission , because the its members are not chosen in elections . 
  and there needs to be an eu president , chosen directly in eu wide elections . 
  first-past-the-post is perhaps the worst variant of democracy . 
  in my opinion , voting districts should be always be large enough to select at least 20 members of the parliament , in proportion to the votes . 
  america can be forgiven for having such a stupid election system because it is the oldest democracy . 
  but i am sure eu would not be stupid enough to choose such a system . 
   do you want the netherlands and germany to be no more than arkansas and texas ? 
  this is a good question . 
  but in the end , we probably want that . 
   council is the primary non-democratic body of the eu , not the commission . 
  yet the commission is the only body whose members are ** not ** selected by voting by the people . 
   we do n't want money , we want you to let us declare bankruptcy already . 
  you do n't want money . 
  you just want to not pay back money you have loaned . 
  after the bankruptcy you would again try to loan new money , and then not pay it back . 
   why the heck are we even part of this joke of a union ? 
  when do you have next elections ? 
  piruntorjuntabunkkeri ( `` anti-satan bunker '' ) is a finnish term for a church . 
  well now you do . 
  i am in new jersey . 
  nobody observes the limit . 
  14 mph above the limit is the norm . 
  ** finland ** 1 . 
  previous government 2 . 
  current government 3 . 
  russia attacked us in ww2, 
    hippocricy   is this an obesity joke ? 
  a lot of swedes are almost as bad in english spelling as native english speakers . 
   europe turns its back on them about the migrant-crisis to be honest , pretty much every eu country has been turning their backs on every other country about the migrant crisis , so greece got no special treatment in this regard . 
  finland has about the highest farm subsidies in europe . 
  much higher than sweden or norway . 
  we could make them smaller , no need to abolish them entirely , and survive just fine . 
   this is were we should draw the line or a fence , even . 
  i do n't know enough about british politics to understand what you are saying . 
  * plainly * biased, 
  we also want to win in the eurovision once more . 
  that has only happened in sweden . 
  in denmark , finland , norway , the anti-immigration party was taken into the government far before they had time to grow to largest party . 
   ` suffering ' more under tax to build our country up finland is more `` build up '' than estonia , but we have higher taxes regardless . 
  i think the more you build up , you also build institutions that need constant tax money to keep running . 
  he has a flag ... 
  i thought you wanted to move serbia as far away from europe as possible . 
  lol . 
   discussing immigration objectively should not be something to be done only when drunk now i have an idea for a tv-show , where merkel gets drunk and then says what she really thinks of immigration . 
  i think things are changing , estonia is slowly less and less considered an eastern european country . 
   when kurds and turks immigrated to netherlands there were no conflict .
