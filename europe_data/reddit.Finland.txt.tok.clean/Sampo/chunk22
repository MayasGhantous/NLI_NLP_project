  would kurds agree with this point of view ? 
  [ here ] ( http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/vaenn/2012/vaenn_2012_2012-09-28_laa_001_fi_001.gif ) is a funny figure from statistics finland , showing population projections made in some previous years , and the actual population history ( the thicker line ) . 
   looks almost exactly like what we do in sweden , except that it happens in june . 
  in finland , the students finish their lectures in february . 
  then they have 1 month free time to study for the finals . 
  then they take the final exams in march/april , and graduate in may . 
  but because they have no more lectures , they have this partying now in february . 
  they sure as hell already know turning left was a bad idea . 
  [ first they came ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came_ ... ) for the assyrians , and i did not speak out -- because i was not an assyrian . 
  then they came for the armenians , and i did not speak out -- because i was not an armenian . 
  then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me . 
  there is some african / middle eastern presence in the central streets of helsinki , and in some eastern suburbs . 
  especially weekend nights . 
  you might get harassed if you wore some visible jewish symbols . 
   ( same goes for christianity ) outside of a few lunatic sects , europeans have mostly learned to compartmentalize religion and politics . 
  you can be a christian , but you do n't take political guidance from the bible . 
  ok . we also do n't know who is behind today 's explosions in sweden and in ankara , either , right ? 
  could be anyone ? 
  until there is proof . 
  why ca n't we all agree the correct term is perkele ? 
  who else would want to shoot at a kurdish demostration ? 
   prior claim to the name that 's silly . 
  it 's not like only one place can have a certain name . 
  there are 22 towns called moscow in the united states , for example . 
  i am a bit confused by your flair . 
  it says : `` macedonia , greece '' . 
  are from macedonia or from greece ? 
  perhaps a greek immigrant living in macedonia ? 
   crap more like [ poo ] ( http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/deadpool-meme-billboard-ad-skull-poo-letter-l.jpg ), 
   ca n't wait for the sequel . 
  `` deaderpool '' ? 
   government is n't enforcing it , but the media is censoring itself then again , if the media was not practicing self-censorship , we do n't know how much the swedish government might try to enforce . 
  i am not entirely certain about the meaning of your words . 
  by some superior magic , america also gets people who want to become americans . 
  how do you do that ? 
  i am not sure i understand why , but you seem deeply offended by something . 
  you support north korea and isis ? 
   make up your minds . 
   europeans have made up their minds : whatever america does , is wrong ;-), 
  what 's aggressive about waiting ? 
  am from finland . 
  i find no difference between vegetables in finnish supermarkets and american supermarkets . 
  i think france should respond : `` so what ? 
  you are sheltering terrorists , too ! '', 
  france is protecting pkk members , but denies taking a side . 
  turkey is protecting hamas members , but is open in taking a side . 
  i do n't think turkey tries to deny taking sides in the hamas-israel conflict . 
   so why are they protesting in paris ? 
  probably safer to protest in paris than in turkey, 
   what makes you think that a european federation and its political scene would be much less dysfunctional than what we see in the united states ? 
  i think the main problem in america is having single-representative voting districts , which leads to two-party system . 
  in europe we do n't have that stupidity ( except in uk ) . 
  but western politicians * want * immigration ? 
  both from eastern europe , and from middle east and africa . 
  ** finland ** the president gave a [ speech ] ( http://www.presidentti.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=341376&amp;nodeid=44810&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ) . 
  now all of media , blogosphere and facebook are trying to explain what he did or did n't mean by it . 
   president gave an anti immigration speech . 
  that is a very one-dimensional characterization of the president 's speech . 
  [ english translation here . 
  ] ( http://www.presidentti.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=341376&amp;nodeid=44810&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ), 
   i can only dread the idea of people not reading these documents because they ca n't be bothered and till getting so much power to decide one 's country 's laws i do n't think our members of parliament read through much of the things they vote on ... 
  south america vs. latin america ; uk vs. britain vs. england ; scandinavia vs. nordic countries . 
  nobody outside of those regions cares what the exact difference is . 
  [ a 14-year old girl was raped by asylym seekers in the small town kempele ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/nuoren_tyton_raiskaus_herattaa_vihaa_ja_pelkoja_kempeleessa/8478754 ) , and because it 's a small town , we can assume everyone knows each other , and thus the girls 's family is know to the prime minister . 
   that many finns would support censorship ? 
  opinions on how to handle the current immigration crisis are all over the place in finland . 
  just like in germany , we have all opinions from far left to far right . 
  but it 's not so easy to estimate , how much support each opinion has in the people . 
   most of the politicians who had commented on the president 's speech where from a left wing party sometimes i get a feeling that the left alliance gets too much weight in media , given that they got only 7 % of votes in the parliament elections . 
  can we [ burn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_rovaniemi ) a couple of your buildings ? 
  just for old times ' sake . 
  if you had european healthcare , i am sure you could n't help but feel some pride and dignity about it . 
  how do i get to see that in a readable resolution ? 
  edit : ah , had to manually edit the url to [ this ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/c/c7/malta%2c_you_are_of_genius.png/revision/latest/ ) . 
   we should have some pride and dignity . 
  we have outsourced that to the americans . 
  such is life, 
   you are not one of us anymore . 
  would you say he is eastern europe , then ? 
   no tv these days , one can survive on netflix alone . 
   you ca n't just ` conquer ' territory any more . 
  russia took crimea ? 
   vihta the correct finnish word is : vasta . 
  vihta is some western finland weird dialect . 
   people just need to come together and admit that religions - specially islam - are very dangerous . 
  well , it 's all relative . 
  during the cold war era , a western christian had probably less dangerous -- and less fundamentalist -- beliefs than an eastern communist . 
  if australia is in eurovision , why is new zealand not ? 
   we deported who is `` we '' ? 
  pc master race, 
   interpol confirmed that he is algerian and is 23 . 
  do you have a source ? 
   `` we will gladly take refugees from sweden , that are native sweeds '' will you cook them swedish food if they demand ? 
   promotes nationalism i guess pan-arab nationalism is not doing very well , arabs fighting so much against each other . 
  so the first step in stabilizing iraq , or syria , would be to divide the country to smaller countries following some ethnic boundaries . 
  so iraq would become maybe 3 different countries , one for sunni arabs , one for shiite arabs , and one for kurds . 
  and then we would start hoping that ( 1 ) those smaller nations would start to develop national pride and stability and ( 2 ) would not start wars against each others . 
  in finland , our true finns party got 17.7 % of the votes in may 2015 elections , and made it to the government . 
  now after having been 8 months in the government , they are [ polling ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1453353392750?jako=f1ca1a7edbbb4600b74b7149fb6c3070&amp;ref=tw-share ) at 9.6 % ,, 
  are there any theories on how to lift a tribal or clan-based society into a modern democracy ?
