  apparently we can not `` give '' them democracy , because it wo n't stick . 
  but are there any theories on possible steps , and how many generations it would take ? 
  like , perhaps they need to suffer a couple of generations under a dictator , if the dictator manages to wipe out clan structures , and after that they could move towards a less harsh form of central government . 
   by what fucking logic is greece to blame for any of this ? 
  if you do something , you are called racist . 
  and if you do n't do anything , you are blamed for not doing anything . 
  as far as i understand -- however illogical that may be -- that is the logic behind this . 
  i do n't think i would ever voluntarily watch a dubbed movie . 
  an animated movie , maybe . 
  i guess they agreed that finland will be their first line of defense . 
  i have heard that in the northern tip of denmark there is a dialect that has done with the ` en ' / ` ett ' madness , and all the nouns have just one gender , ` en ' . 
  is this true ? 
  i would assume that technically savvy slovakians are also leaving slovakia ? 
  why is this in / r/europe ? 
  politicians doing what the people actually want . 
  sometimes democracy works . 
  prohibition era did nothing but made alcohol use problems and alcohol-related crime problems worse . 
  i believe the same applies to any drugs . 
  it probably should . 
  would probably greatly decrease drug-related problems . 
  `` what do others think of us ? '', 
  you probably would have loved ruotsi without pakko , too . 
   what does this have to do with europe ? 
  like the [ article ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/ ) posted above explains , there are some interesting differences in the handling and regulations as related to eggs , between usa and europe . 
  thank you for the correction . 
  switzerland has draft , so do n't go there . 
  fine . 
  the population inside the city borders , copenhagen is 7 % smaller than helsinki . 
  for the urban area , 13 % larger , and for the metropolitan area , 39 % larger . 
  even if we take that 39 % , it is hardly the `` twice '' that you said . 
  | city | urban | metro -- | ------- | ---------- | --------- copenhagen | 583 000 | 1 264 000 | 1 992 000 helsinki | 626 000 | 1 116 000 | 1 432 000 ratio | 0.93 | 1.13 | 1.39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki, 
  not according to wikipedia . 
   war seems quite far away over here when war seems close , it is probably already too late then . 
  maybe also paying taxes could be on a voluntary basis ? 
   i 'd emigrate the very second a law like this would be enacted . 
  would you consider emigrating to sweden , norway or finland ? 
   as opposed to indo european do n't indo-european languages [ originate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-europeans ) from somewhere between kazakhstan and ukraine ? 
  sounds pretty eastern to me . 
  i have followed this topic for a while . 
  here are some basics : * like everything in the nordics , the basement rock in the gulf of finland is sturdy and of high quality . 
  much easier to build a tunnel here than in the soft sandstone of the english channel . 
  * the english channel tunnel , converted to present day money , cost about 18 billion $ . 
  the helsinki -- tallinn tunnel is estimated at 13 billion $ . 
  * they estimate to build a high speed train , some of which exist also today , so the train would go from helsinki to tallinn in only 30 minutes . 
  * train from london to paris takes 2 hours 15 minutes , too long for commuter traffic . 
  the channel tunnel gets about 20 million passengers in year . 
  * a better comparison is the copenhagen -- malm\u00f6 connection ( tunnel + bridge ) , which gets about 18 million passengers in year , of which about 12 million by train . 
  ( you can also drive by car . ), 
  the train from copenhagen to malm\u00f6 is about 35 minutes , so people actually commute . 
  * in population , tallinn is about the same size as malm\u00f6 . 
  helsinki is a bit smaller than copenhagen . 
  * at present , the ferries ( travel time 1 hour 40 minutes in summer , 2 hours in winter ) between helsinki and tallinn have about ~ ~ 11 million ~ ~ 8 million passengers per year . 
  yes , i do n't think there is much other threats in europe than russia . 
  and while it is a threat to us , it is not so much threat to you . 
  be happy . 
   avoid being drafted in russia or ukraine would be really bad luck to be drafted in both russia and ukraine . 
   you can never replace pilots you can destroy a country 's infrastructure with airplanes , but you can not occupy a country with airplanes alone . 
  do you think if vietnam had had professional army , they would have done better ? 
  as far as i understand , neither soviet nor american forces have been able to keep afghanistan occupied . 
  if there ever is a civil war , i think it would be better for the country to have conscription army rather than professional soldiers . 
   also , conscripted people should be used only for defense . 
  that 's what 's not well with israel 's approach in my opinion . 
  do n't they say that sometimes the best defense is a good offense . 
   freezing my ass in -15 celcius -15 c is nothing , if you have proper clothes , and can afterwards go to a warm house or tent . 
   ww1 and ww2 pretty much destroyed any romantic notion of warfare . 
  in finland , ww2 introduced a lot of romantic notions . 
   never would i ever go fight someone else 's battles . 
  i guess the swedish people do n't feel that defending sweden is someone else 's battle . 
  but their own . 
  polar bears in the streets of helsinki . 
   when democracy fails and there is an easily identifiable ` other ' , that 's a perfect opportunity for the fascists to come along . 
  so basically the idealistic politicians that try too much to save the world , and stop listening what the general population actually wants , are the cause that after them fascism rises ? 
  have you considered adding a flag , so people would know which country you are talking about ? 
   girls do n't usually drink as much hahaha !, 
   we do n't want to know about your ills then * why do you ask ? 
  latvia and lithuania , wtf ? 
  i though we could have some , ahem , baltic brotherly love . 
  hurricanes in estonia ? 
   this stream of water can be funneled to hydroelectric power plants ... but then it 'll flow back to the oceans , right ? 
   `` only a german would complain about german administration '' and nordics, 
   sweden is facing jews emigration too and there were no attacks at all . 
  no terrorist attacks targeting jews in particular , but there have been muslim terrorist attacks and attempts in sweden : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_gothenburg_terrorism_plot, 
   potato such is life . 
   other fun stuff like burning huge ass bonfires . 
  the swedish santa lives in a hut north of kiruna ? 
  i do n't know german , but i understood every word . 
  there are five passengers in a plane : an american , an englishman , a norwegian , a swede and a finn . 
  the plane starts to lose altitude , and the pilot tells them they must lose weight . 
  they throw out everything , the seats , their luggage . 
  but then the pilot tells them they still need to lose weight , or everyone is going to die . 
  so the englishman volunteers to sacrifice himself , jumps out of the plane and shouts `` long live the queen ! '' . 
  still need to lose weight . 
  the american jumps out of the plane and shouts `` geronimo ! '' . 
  still need to lose weight . 
  `` long live nordic cooperation ! '', 
  shout the finn and the norwegian , and throw the swede out of the plane . 
   any other mode of public transportation over the bridge what other modes are there available ? 
  how could we accept only non-moronic turks with no funny hats to eu ? 
  how would that work in practice ?
