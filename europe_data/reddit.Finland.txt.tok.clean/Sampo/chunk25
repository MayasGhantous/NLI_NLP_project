  engineering and physics also c/c + + is used a lot . 
  so perhaps meteorology is the only science totally dominated by fortran use . 
   germany ... efficient and how things actually work as expected . 
  sometimes even the [ germans take time to fix things ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=techniker+ist+informiert ) . 
   north america has shit bread fortunately it is easy to bake your own bread , just [ google ` no knead bread ' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=no+knead+bread ) . 
  some time ago i hosted a french girl from couchsurfing , and she said my bread was the best she had in america . 
  at least more affluent areas in the us also have artisan bakeries , which make good bread , although prices are not cheap . 
   rye bread is not bread [ what did you just say ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smusx8airyy ), 
   apparently eating banana peals look like jalapenos to me, 
   `` that 's not right !, 
  that 's not manly ! '', 
  what about [ images drawn by tom of finland ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=tom+of+finland&amp;tbm=isch ) , are they manly ? 
  sweden is already planning a very swedish approach to gang shootings : * rostami argues that swedish police `` need to be more creative '' when it comes to tackling organized gangs and points to initiatives taken in norway which have encouraged rival members to engage in dialogue with one another .

  was expecting [ this ] ( http://img.memecdn.com/short-history-of-norway_o_3233195.jpg ), 
  i hear , a many turks in germany actually vote for akp . 
   why is it so fucking expensive ? 
  it 's not building the buildings that is expensive . 
  it 's the cost of land in a good location in a city . 
  an increasing number of people prefer the urban lifestyle , but unfortunately most of the cities are very afraid to start building higher and denser , so for homes in a central location , there is much more demand than supply , which drives the prices sky high . 
  people should understand that cities are meant to grow , they are not meant to be museums of how the city looked like in your childhood . 
   the usa is enormous [ yes it is ] ( http://imgur.com/ncblgol ), 
  yet , usa seems to be much more succesfull at integrating immigrants than any country in europe . 
   $ 30 - $ 60 per month or per year ? 
  at least in finland , the church supports lgbt , abortions , and has nothing against stem cell research . 
  and ipa !, 
   not only if they wanted a sex change but also if they wanted a `` legal sex change '' i would assume anyone can get sex change surgery on their own expense whenever . 
  i guess the requirement you are talking about is for the public healthcare to pay for the operation . 
  but not over the fence , [ somebody ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wu_sangui ) opened the gates . 
  hmm , maybe there is some synergy there somewhere, 
  sometimes it 's hard to say no , if an american company pays double the salary , compared to europe . 
   i think they should n't provide retirement income in foreign countries . 
  that begs to be abused . 
  so people would still pay for the retirement insurance , but get no benefit if they move out of the country ? 
  seems a bit ... totalitarian to me . 
  maybe they have eu membership plans for isis , too ? 
   pro big business like hilary , trump trump , obviously , is from a big business background because he owns big businesses . 
  but he is self-funding his campaign , so he is not dependent on donations from big businesses , like hillary is . 
   kurdistan will into eu earlier than turkey . 
  i can understand there is some eu loathing in turkey . 
  part of that is for good reason , and part of it is not . 
  but no , i find it very hard to believe eu would actually let independent kurdistan to join . 
  wow . 
  you people are just crazy . 
  well , it is middle east , after all . 
   kurds living in western turkey give no fuck about kurdistan so it will be a bit cruel to send them to kurdistan at gun-point but there is nothing else we can do . 
  why would n't turkey just let them live their lives in western turkey ? 
  they are already turkish citizens . 
   self-defence in native language what does this mean ? 
  if someone tells you to piss of , you can respond ` fuck you ' in your native language ? 
   it ought to be banned . 
  it is banned in many places around the world still . 
  i am sorry you were born in a wrong continent . 
   saying the word zaza to some kurds will piss them off as they claim that the zaza are kurds lol , just like turkey thinks kurds are just turkish . 
  if kurdistan would , by some miracle , become independent next year , what do yo think would happen ? 
  would they be able to establish elections and a government , or would the democrats , sharia-supporters and communists end up in a civil war against each other ? 
  it is customary in sweden , that before elections parties announce with which other parties they will , or are ready to , form government . 
  before sd changed the dynamics , parties would organize themselves into two blocks , and whichever block got the majority of votes , would form the government . 
  almost like a two-party system . 
  so apparently parties that were in rival blocks just recently before elections , do n't find enough common ground to cooperate in government . 
  you can order online, 
   enemy being 20 feet away and rats for dinner  enemy being only 20 km away , and pheasants for dinner kids , learn your metric system , or you get rats for dinner . 
  poland can not into genetics . 
  also non-gmo crops can by patented . 
  google ` clearfield wheat ' . 
   gmo ca n't simply be referred to as good or bad vaccines ca n't simply be referred to as good or bad ? 
  what about [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prd64kgeqs0 ) ? 
   hey , now !, 
  at least we 're not dark and cold . 
  :-p * [ my sky is darker than thine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djxndfnfyti ) *, 
  i would assume even eastern european gay people want rights , and eastern european women want abortion to be legal . 
   if it wants to do business in germany it has to obey german laws . 
  simple as that . 
  if germany bans facebook , like china , germans would probably start using facebook via vpn proxies , like chinese do . 
  does the spanish constitution say that it requires a referendum to modify the constitution ? 
  maybe it 's like the foreign legion , where foreigners fight for the glory of france and baguettes . 
  ah , so they are not against better european defense per se . 
  they just think existing nato framework is the better way to do it than establishing a new framework for eu army . 
  perhaps they are correct . 
  then again , ireland is very much a free rider defense-wise , so perhaps they are in general against any solution that would mean them start pulling their own weight . 
   the uk 's defence secretary has promised to veto any eu army plans until it 's formal departure ~ ~ why the fuck are they doing that ? 
  is n't that more than a little shitty thing to do ? ~ ~ edit : i understood wrong . 
   it 's time we get our shit together and really unite you talking about italy or eu ? 
   no european politician have , right now , the popularity to rise to the role o european leader . 
  the next president of the european commission should come from one of the countries formerly known as eastern europe . 
   as a third layer europe taking stronger responsibility in defending europe does n't need to mean eu army . 
  nato does n't need to mean that american defends europe . 
  most eu countries are nato members , and they could improve europe 's defenses inside the nato framework as well . 
  i do n't think there is only peace and love and unimosity between trump and the republican party ,, 
  yeah , too many people are taking whatever trump has said at some point much more seriously that what trump himself takes . 
  ... veep ? 
   a : a loudmouth pro-russia isolationist who might screw the economy or weaken nato and therefore endanger europe   b : a sleazy war-hawk career politician who might start a war or otherwise escalate the russian situation and therefore endanger europe it would be nice if europe was able to carry its own weight in military defense , so we would n't be so dependable on whether america decides to defend us or not .

  a craft beer in a good pub in central helsinki will be 7-8 $ . 
  a mass brand lager in a suburb or smaller town bar can easily be just 3.50 $ . 
   the two are the first refugee couple that latvia took in , with the husband working at the asylum centre as an interpreter . 
  so you have two refugees , and one of those is working as an interpreter ... for the other one ? 
  greece : is it unclear whether the shops are open , or whether anyone has any money to go shopping ? 
  or even 6 other days , in many countries .
