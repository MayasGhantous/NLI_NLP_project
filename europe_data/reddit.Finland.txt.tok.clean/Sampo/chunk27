  non-first timers sit 2/3 . 
  if you have not been in jail in past 3 years , you are considered a first timer . 
   they are n't muslim why not ? 
  the soviets chased the burglar through the neighborhood , and after defeating the burglar , occupied at least 6 of their neighbors ' houses for the next 46 years . 
  replacing one tyranny by another tyranny , you are stretching it to call this `` liberation '' . 
   who ever said that soviets were liberators ? 
  the soviets ? 
   the milk used in hershey 's milk chocolate is treated to make it last longer ; the actual process is a trade secret but speculators think that the milk is intentionally soured to promote longevity . 
  a process called lipolysis releases butyric acid , which stabilises the milk against further fermentation , and also makes it taste like dick cheese . 
  i live in the usa east coast , and this is a fucking chocolate wasteland . 
  everything they have is hershey 's which [ tastes like shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hershey_bar#hershey.27s_milk_chocolate ) and costs easily $ 8/lb = 16 $ / kg . 
  they have imported european chocolate like lindt but that goes easily to $ 18/lb = 35 $ / kg . 
  compared to finland , where decent chocolate goes for 8 to 12 $ / kg . 
  [ domino ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiedosto:domino_cookie_pack_ ( 60th_anniversary \\ ) . jpg ) is still better than oreos . 
  they have practiced it . 
   if i visited and acted like a typical american and tried to strike a convo , would i be met with hostility , be ignored , get a good response , etc. . ? 
  tourists are of course allowed to do silly things . 
  you would most probably get a friendly response . 
   how about the london underground ? 
  just go to work after 10 , and leave after 19 . 
  depending on which line of london tube you use , you might even get a seat . 
  if a part of a country could never leave , to renegotiate the deal , so to say , then usa would still be part of great britain . 
  if 97 % of texans really demonstrated determined will to leave , and you would n't let them , then yes you would be . 
  edit : maybe ` tyranny ' is not the best of words here . 
  but you would be total dicks to not let them go . 
   you 're not well informed about the spanish society . 
  this is true . 
  i can only observe how petty the opinion of madrid ( and some spanish commenters here ) look from the outside . 
  spain has actually been a democracy only for 38 years . 
  maybe they still struggle with some basic concepts and are prone to revert back to tyranny . 
   rich drunk finns buy our booze ? 
  if they were rich , they could afford to buy their booze in finland . 
  it 's the non-rich part of finnish population which travels abroad to get the benefit of cheaper prices . 
   plane accidents are you [ swedish deputy prime minister \u00c5sa romson ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/19/asa-romson-swedish-deputy-pm-refers-to-911-terrori/ ) ? 
  [ bbc says jihadists ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37312538 ), 
  maybe he means that the ancestors who arrived to georgia and ukraine from wherever were not yet indo-europeans . 
  [ this controversial book ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=iq_and_the_wealth_of_nations&amp;oldid=487100081 ) lists 68 , so perhaps a they used that as the source . 
  as where the book got its numbers , someone would need to access the book . 
  was once in a full pizza place ( `` nomad '' ) in us east coast with two other europeans . 
  literally none but our table used fork and knife to eat the pizza . 
  marmite curry with marmite pale ale , mmmm . 
   i understand finland doing it we sided with hitler against stalin , because stalin was the more imminent threat . 
  when the threat from stalin was no more , we turned against hitler , too . 
  i apologize for my inadequate skills in the german language . 
  do you get a lot of syrian tourists ? 
   estonian centre party have a lot of pro-russia estonian politicians finnish center party has some , too . 
   educates people in foreign lands about elections and democracy people may joke about `` america spreading democracy '' , but you did valuable and important work . 
   how about not putting the main street inbetween lots of buildings put the main street somewhere far away in the countryside . 
  problem solved . 
   why does all that not count as `` fiscal transfer '' ? 
  because it is not large enough to keep greece afloat . 
  they are able to consume even more money . 
   fiscal transfers i suspect people would not have given consent to that, 
   yet just try to find a good whiz in london . 
  or anywhere , for that matter . 
  so what do they do and how do they behave ? 
  i think in nordic countries ( excluding denmark ) other nordic citizens can get a citizenship after having lived for 2 years ( and knowing the language ) . 
  so in 6 years one could collect 3 other nordic passports . 
   for all he knew they were persian shias just because you can not tell a turk from a persian , does n't necessarily meant others ca n't . 
   they catch the perpetrators . 
  or , as the case may be , perspirators . 
   hated turks & arabs if he was bullied in school , and grew up in an multicultural working class neighborhood , could it be that he was mostly bullied by turks and arabs at his school ? 
   8/9 victims are sunnis . 
  if you take randomly 9 people from that shopping center , at that time , how probably would most of them be sunnis ? 
  good point, 
   define stable ? 
  not a laughing stock in press in the rest of the world for several weeks . 
   certainly more stable than the mess that pr would give us . 
  at the moment , the rest of europe with their pr ( proportional voting system ) seems more stable than uk with their fptp ... 
  did you say [ downfall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/downfall_ ( 2004_film \\ ) ) ? 
  probably not if you were american, 
  how about [ chainsaw on ice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lgaqwjg.gifv ) ? 
   walmart cheese incident : up to 20 % cellulose [ normal cheese ] ( http://www.walmart.com/ip/great-value-sliced-mild-cheddar-cheese-8-oz/10452514 ) in walmart , no . 
  a can of [ grated parmesan ] ( http://www.walmart.com/ip/great-value-grated-parmesan-cheese-16-oz/19400150 ) , yes , contains powdered cellulose , but [ apparently ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-not-so-grate-news-about-the-wood-pulp-in-your-parmesan-cheese-a6878956.html ) 7.8 % , not 20 % . 
   its exactly these sorts of regulations that have given us the highest quality foods in the world . 
  if your country 's food standards were shittier than eu standards , then yes . 
  if \u65e5\u672c\u56fd is `` state of japan '' , then \u65e5\u672c means `` state of '' , right ? 
  right ? 
   source for him yelling allahu akbar ? 
   yelled `` i 'm not a muslim '' must be frustrating to go on a shooting rampage when everyone automatically assumes you a muslim, 
   this might actually accelerate the creation of a european army sadly , many eu countries would probably just give up the baltics to russia , instead of getting serious about european army . 
  at the moment we see things going to shit because turkey is giving too little importance to atat\u00fcrks ideals . 
  i do n't think they ever were, 
   as we can see in america we also saw this in brexit, 
  at least in finland also non-citizens can vote in the municipal elections . 
   william of orange he is also the reason why the orange variety of carrots became so popular , over red and yellow varieties . 
  [ usa murder rates ] ( http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state#mrord ) vary wildly from state to state , from 0.9 in new hampshire to 10.3 in louisiana . 
  four us states get under belgium 's rate , 1.8 . 
  ( homicides per 100 000 people per year ), 
   how about capturing and deporting them back to greenland ? 
  the top comment says greenland does n't want them back . 
   they do n't eat pork or drink alcohol all secular turks i have met , drank alcohol . 
  some of them also ate pork . 
  europe has its own xenophobic rednecks , i see . 
  we need to be angry about more than one thing at the same time, 
  but if the land was returned , do you see some chilling then ? 
  i think this is an important question . 
   surely enough disappears into the pockets of the corrupt to be angry about . 
  is that the right thing to be angry about , though ? 
  yes it is,
