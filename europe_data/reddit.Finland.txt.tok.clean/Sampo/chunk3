  or have there been some scientific sociological studies ? 
   looking at traditionally moderate districts , they party has gone from 50-60 % support there to < 40 % . 
  and those votes went to sd ? 
  come again ? 
  afaik [ sd are euroskeptic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_democrats#foreign_policy ) whereas our [ national coalition party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_coalition_party ) is very pro-eu . 
  we will need to continue this discussion in 2018 and 2022 . 
   we 've lived happily without pc grammar it does not need to be thought of as pc . 
  there are lots of languages ( like finnish , estonian , turkish , persian , spoken mandarin ) that natively do n't have gendered pronouns , and this has nothing to do with being pc or not . 
  then there is japanese , where the situation is complicated as shit , and korean where you can choose whether you want to use a gendered or a neutral pronoun . 
   take leaflets from all the parties . 
  sometimes you ca n't , because there is fraud and [ someone has hidden the leaflets of some parties ] ( http://www.dn.se/valet-2014/flera-fall-av-misstankt-valfusk/ ) . 
   over here the 1st party gets 50 seats bonus well that sounds ... retarded . 
  do you know what they did here in finland last time ? 
  our ( m ) made a coalition with our ( s ) , ( mp ) , ( v ) , ( kd ) and our svenska folkpartiet . 
  it was called `` sixpack '' . 
  such wide cooperation would be impossible in sweden , though ? 
  my native language does n't have gendered pronouns , and i always feel a bit awkward when i have to use `` she '' and `` he '' . 
   hbtq [ lgbt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt ) in english, 
  the only way you can get sd to start losing votes , is to take them in , let them be in government for one term , so the people will see how bad decisions they make . 
  or you can let them slowly grow until they alone get 50 % of the votes , and then you can be like hungary is today , when a single populist party got over 50 % of seats . 
   to go partying in copenhagen in no time !, 
  oh , that i have done . 
   i was hoping to hear the word cunt you do n't seem to know much about swedish politics :-), 
   scandinavian mutually intelligible language ftw . 
  yeah , danes can understand when i speak ( when i speak swedish ) , but i can not understand them . 
  well , yes , if the right wing negotiates a majority coalition , of course they can form the government . 
  they would have the majority of the parliament , they could do whatever they want . 
  but there is a strong tradition that the `` loser '' will not try to take initiative . 
  in theory , they could . 
  but in practice , they will not . 
   some people want to end their friendships with anyone who will admit that they voted on the sweden democrats . 
  oh the tolerance of the swedish society . 
  well that 's not ... totally impossible . 
  but it is really a strong tradition ( but not in the law ) in finland and in sweden that the perceived winning party should form the government , and the party leader should become the prime minister . 
  well , they will need to negotiate and try different options . 
  eventually they will figure out something . 
  [ stefan l\u00f6fven ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=stefan+l%c3%b6fven&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch ) vs. [ alexander stubb ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=alexander+stubb&amp;bih=484&amp;tbm=isch ), 
  but the center-right is clearly the loser , and the social democrats are the winner . 
  so it 's tradition that that the social democrats will take the initiative and try to negotiate a government , preferably a majority government . 
  if that does n't work out , i do n't know what happens next . 
   right one supported by sd i think the center-right has said that they wo n't do this . 
   or a grand coalition of the largest parties and i think they have said they wo n't do this , either . 
  ( or course , in principle they could change their minds . ), 
  hmm yeah , [ seems like ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_general_election,_2014#poll_results ) in the polls ca . 
  2 weeks ago they ( mp is the greens ) were in around 10 % . 
  they mostly finish counting the small towns first , so the results can still change quite a bit when the counting from big cities gets finished towards the end . 
  you can spend an exchange year at a swedish university . 
  they have some amount of lectures given in english over there , too . 
   fptp i do n't think [ first-past-the-post ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) systems should even be called real democracy anymore . 
  they should belong to pre-1800 history . 
   socialists today almost universally reject the ussr ( et al. 
  ) 's way of rule it 's not just the ussr . 
  china , laos , vietnam , cuba , albania , yugoslavia , north korea , east germany . 
  probably some african countries . 
  everywhere where the socialists got to actually govern the state , the results were less than splendid . 
  i 'd guess cracking encryption would be integer operations , not floating point . 
  yeah , i am willing to agree that this is one of the most important questions in political sociology . 
  does a socialistic system necessarily create conditions that favor the rise of malicious people in the power structures , and the resulting loss of quality of life for the citizens ? 
  so far all of the examples seem to support this . 
  but should we have the courage for one more large human experiment , with the risk of potentially catastrophic consequences ? 
  or , if the experiment is successful , we may have created something better than what we have now . 
   people said the same thing 200 years ago yeah , and 96 years ago they actually tried socialism . 
  til : intel processors [ are mostly manufactured in the usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_intel_manufacturing_sites ) . 
  i would have thought that these days everything is manufactured in china . 
  perhaps someone should update wikipedia ? 
  also [ wikipedia says 3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_land_forces#military_vehicles ) but does n't mention one of them being in a museum and one in a swamp .

   nokia had a touchscreen phone a long time ago . 
  i had [ nokia 7710 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_7710 ) with tv reception in 2004 . 
  it took several minuts for the realplayer to start , so a quick watch of tv while waiting for a bus was n't so quick in practice . 
   its to far south in sweden tell it to the [ mitt\u00e5dalens sameby ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitt%c3%a5dalens_sameby ) which is located right there . 
  yeah , but if you live near fun\u00e4sdalen it is probably because your family has always lived there . 
  not because you 're from lapland and just decided to move there and buy a house . 
  whereas , if you live in oslo , you probably did decide to move out of your original hometown ( or village , or wilderness ) and move to oslo . 
   nobody * forced * nokia to hire elop . 
  the word on the streets was , the large ( mostly american ) investors who owned large amount of nokia stock , forced nokia to hire elop . 
  the previous nokia ceo would have chosen something else , if it were up to him alone . 
  but of course the stock owners have the final word . 
  most of the immigration ( to finland , or to sweden ) happens without the refugee status . 
  the officially recognized refugees are a smallish fraction , other people immigrate by other means . 
   norway is a better scotland ? 
  the pints cost triple and the people are colder . 
  i do n't think nordic people are colder , it 's just that we are [ more quiet ] ( http://virtualwayfarer.com/nordic-conversations-are-different/ ) and you misinterpret that as coldness ? 
   the sami people are n't really a separatist group . 
  but there have been some small groups of sami people with separatist agendas . 
  i have seen sami flags in front of houses by the smaller roads north of the 84 between fun\u00e4sdalen and r\u00f8ros . 
  right about [ here ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@62.5760502,12.5965553,11z ) . 
  so the map is very accurate . 
  edit : sorry it was like 10-15 km more north , [ here ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@62.6919846,12.6693669,14z ) . 
  even the name of the place is [ mitt\u00e5dalens sameby ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitt%c3%a5dalens_sameby ) . 
  [ it is the greatest henge of all !,

   the `` little mermaid '' in copenhagen i agree that there is no point in being taken by a tour bus to see the little mermaid . 
  but if you are sightseeing copenhagen by a bike , then the ride by the sea and the parks is a really nice bike ride , not very long , and you can also take a look at the little mermaid . 
  ok , i do n't know about sweden . 
  but in finland it is possible to submit the social welfare application also by mail , or in their webpages . 
   a totally irrelevant small nation with tiny population just like us . 
  you did n't open the link . 
  the article is about new dna evidence . 
  scotland represents only 8 % of the population of the current uk , so whatever that 8 % does , should n't have a very large effect on the economy of the 92 % .
