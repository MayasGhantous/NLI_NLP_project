   do n't know why you would leave the keys in the truck by the way , even when unloading . 
  so that terrorists do n't come to kill you in order to get the keys ? 
   95 % of bills in the nl parliament come from the government . 
  in nl , but nor in eu , members of the government are typically also members of the parliament . 
   so what are people complaining about when they say the eu is full of un-elected officials that do not represent them ? 
  my guess : that the commission , whose members are not chosen in elections , can propose new laws . 
  and the parliament , which is chosen in elections , can not propose new laws . 
  india , 1310 million people , makes do with a bicameral parliament and a president . 
  does anyone else think it 's quite fucked up that the commission has the power to propose new laws , although the commission is , in this diagram , not on the `` legislative '' side but on the `` executive '' side ? 
  new laws should come from the parliament , like they do in normal democratic countries . 
  lawmakers should be people who are directly voted into their positions by the people . 
  not people who are chosen by an indirect process . 
  a ferry from tallinn to helsinki is 90 minutes , and then in the rest 22h30 one could reach most of finland and some of sweden , too . 
  but this is not shown on the map . 
   we do n't know if pineapple was actually a code word for something could mean ananas, 
  you dutch sure have some weird looking meatballs, 
  actually there is a bit under 300 000 swedish speaking ( as first language ) people living in finland , but over 350 000 foreign language speakers ( as first language ) . 
  most of the latter probably do n't know swedish . 
   why would anyone from finland only be subbed to / r/finland and not to / r/suomi if they do n't speak finnish . 
  dude , r/suomi is the finnish subreddit ( in finnish , r/finland is for english discussions ) , so 1.1 % is the correct number . 
  and more importantly , we beat netherlands . 
  so there members of the opposite sex are between 20 and 34 years old , but they are level 3 nuts .

   there is also no problem for finnish speakers not getting help in their own language according to [ this article ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/201703272200092455_uu.shtml ) the town of pietarsaari hires doctors from sweden , so sometimes finnish speaking people need to have an interpreter to visit a doctor . 
  just berries and fruit . 
  blackcurrant and white currant dominates , usually . 
  ( wtf english , why is blackcurrant spelled as one word and white currant as two ? ), 
    wineries ( yes there are wineries in finland )   ill be honest this is actually shocking news to me well , they are not really able to grow grapes in finland . 
  they make wines from berries and fruit . 
  at least in finland we call those drinks wines , too . 
  but would n't it be funny if eastern europe made alcohol more expensive than in the west , and then all the easterners started to travel to west to buy loads of alcoholic drinks . 
  the germans would be like wtf is going on here . 
  alcohol tax for wines is 3.39 $ per litre , so 10.17 $ alcohol tax for the 3 litre box . 
  plus 24 % sales tax . 
  so it 's true : sweden is sinking . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ forgot ^ ^ that ... 
  ok , the government-owned monopoly does n't make a profit , but government profits a lot in taxes . 
  it 's real .

   personally i would just ban alcohol all together oh we tried prohibition from 1919 to 1932 , until we figured it was a bad idea . 
  selling e.g. 
  0.5 litre can of urquell for 16.90 sek / 1.80 $ , how the hell you do n't make a profit ? 
  i give it to you , your within temptation is pretty good runner-up to our nightwish . 
  but you have nothing like our hydraulic press channel . 
  you can have \u00c5land any time you like , var s\u00e5 god . 
   is n't that fourth piece illegal in and of itself ? 
  when we , and you , joined eu , eu gave a special permission to retain the alcohol monopoly system , because our national psyche could not handle free availability of alcohol and the whole country would drink itself to death . 
  now they are just testing the limits , how far that special permission actually could be interpreted . 
  but yes , eu already thinks that it stretching it too far . 
  ** my summary ** as you may know , finland , sweden and norway have government owned chains that have monopoly on selling wine and booze , only beer and other mild alcoholic drinks can be bough in stores and supermarkets . 
  finland is planning to change alcohol legislation : 1 . 
  ** old : ** shops and stores can only sell beer , cider etc. 
  under 4.7 % and only if they are manufactured by brewing . 
  ** new ** shops and stores can sell alcoholic drinks up to 5.5 % , no limits on manufacturing process . 
  ** old : ** wineries ( yes there are wineries in finland ) can sell their own wine on the premises , even if it 's stronger than 4.7 % . 
  ** new : ** also craft breweries could sell their products on their premises , even if stronger than 5.5 % . 
  ** old : ** only the government-owned monopoly chain [ alko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alko ) can sell strong alcohol , and only in their stores . 
  ** new : ** alko would retain the monopoly , but they could sell stuff from their web shop , to be picked up from third party locations . 
  ** old : ** mail-ordering alcoholic drinks from other eu countries to finland is legal . 
  ( in practice finnish customs might fuck up your parcel because fuck you . ), 
  ** new : ** mail-ordering alcoholic drinks from eu-countries would become illegal . 
  as per eu rules , finland submitted the proposed new law to eu for a comments period of 3 months . 
  ( now , eu actually has problems with items 3 and 4 . 
  eu thinks that 3 breaks equality , and if the government-monopoly gets to sell by webshop , other companies should get to do this , too . 
  and obviously eu thinks that 4 goes too far , can not make it illegal to order stuff from other eu countries . ), 
  ** however ** , the swedish monopoly chain [ systembolaget ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systembolaget ) also wrote a letter commenting the new law . 
  according to them , finland has an undesirable binge-drinking culture , and the new more liberal alcohol legislation ( points 1 and 2 above ) would increase consumption and harm public health and harm children . 
  so the swedes had submitted [ a commentary ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/resourcesexternal/getattachment.cfm?id=d28b4ac7-ee72-7ddd-0f149e68826b89a5 ) where they oppose the proposed new , more liberal , alcohol law in finland . 
  in a galaxy far away . 
  so the mediterranean sea in moonlight looks like dirty plastic . 
  finnish-baltic-danish-norwegian union could have sweden surrounded , though .
