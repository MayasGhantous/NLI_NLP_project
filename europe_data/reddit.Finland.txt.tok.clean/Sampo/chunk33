  it is also technically possible to make voting both not anonymous and not secure . 
   most countries seem to gravitate towards a two party system . 
  most english-speaking countries have very antique voting systems that favor gravitation towards two-party system . 
  but most european countries have better voting systems and real multi-party democracy . 
  it can attack democracy and human rights any time . 
  can hindus wear swastikas in germany ? 
   eu were critizing turkey over this eu did n't understand shit about the situation . 
   assad has too much blood on his hands to receive active support by the eu . 
  in general , that would apply to almost any party in that corner of the world . 
   we have the entire world of information at our fingertips and we voted for a guy whose entire plan was `` i 'll magically make everything great . 
  believe me '' . 
  well , your choices were `` more of the same '' and `` i 'll magically make everything great '' . 
  the photo is from 2002 . 
  he was 53 years old . 
  is that camo painted for fights in [ blue and white tulip fields ] ( http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/4abcaeeac31041d4b4e1cd3c13a51936/blue-hyacinth-and-white-tulips-ejk6kh.jpg ) ? 
  this is not the whole thing ( which apparently was more than 10 hours ) , just what funny bits the video makers have selected for this 9 minutes piece . 
  this is based on the questions in the [ voting advice application ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_advice_application ) by a newspaper helsingin sanomat . 
  [ link to the application webpage ] ( http://www.vaalikone.fi/kunta2017/ ) . 
  unfortunately , they do n't tell how they have decided to put loadings on the questions , so we do n't know which questions , and how much , give scores in the conservative/liberal or the left-wing/right-wing axes . 
  if whatever scores the newspaper weighted on the questions differs on what you would consider liberal or conservative , left-wing or right-wing , opinions , then your personal maps would look different than theirs . 
  i think the worst part is that they have not published their scoring system , so we do n't know what questions and answers they consider weighting on the conservative/liberal axis . 
  you could always eat shawarma , or gyros . 
   if all ice on greenland melts in 100 years , this map is the most accurate thing you have . 
  if all ice on greenland melts , how much will the sea level rise , and how much will the map thus change ? 
   israel is there because it ca n't be anywhere else . 
  if more people just accepted this , some problems in the middle east politics would be solved . 
   is n't this a european song contest ? 
  who says you ca n't make european songs in australia . 
  but who wants into central europic ? 
   after 5 years you get the chance to apply for a working permit aswell . 
  err , what does this mean ? 
  for the first 5 years you have to live without working ? 
  so any country that starts to vote for us ( finland ) can eventually into nordic after some years ? 
  i am not a native speaker of english . 
  i just have a question on terminology : [ washington post writes ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/several-injured-in-axe-attack-at-duesseldorf-train-station/2017/03/09/366557e8-0513-11e7-9d14-9724d48f5666_story.html ) that the perpetrator * `` arrived in 2009 and was granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds '' * . 
  so if he already was granted a residence permit , is he still asylum seeker ? 
  i would think that after your application is processed and accepted , you would n't be a seeker any more ? 
   a european superstate would be much more effective in pursuing its interests lately , so much european energy has been spent in fighting each other about what our interests should be . 
  yes , and it seems to fit under how [ wikipedia defines a country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country ) . 
   finland was n't independent before 1917 ... 
  but it was a country nevertheless . 
   you left out the part where they were n't citizens of australia at the time . 
  apparently the whole concept of australian citizenship did n't exist before 1949 . 
  and in 1902 the indigenous australians were , more or less , considered as british subjects but were specifically disqualified from voting . 
  we are talking about australia . 
  in 1902 australia allowed white women ( women of european origin ) to vote and to be elected . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suffrage_in_australia#female_suffrage but not until 1962 could indigenous australians vote in federal elections . 
  yes . 
  besides usa , there are lots of countries where prisoners can not vote . 
  but at least in europe , the majority of countries let prisoners to vote . 
   wait , other countries do n't ban felons/prisoners from voting ? 
  most of european countries do n't . 
  some do . 
  also in usa , some states do and some do n't . 
  from 1788 to 1841 , new zealand was part of the colony of new south wales . 
   by that definition of `` universal suffrage '' , the us would not really achieve it until 1965 because that was when the voting rights act was signed into law , protecting all citizens ' right to vote regardless of race . 
  even today , over 5 million adults ( 2.5 % of potential voters ) in the us are not allowed to vote , because in some states prisoners and/or convicted felons can not vote . 
  so in norwegian it 's sjamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  i am not genetically very uralic , but the finnish language is a uralic language . 
  so we should all start learning the scottish accent . 
   republicans fighting for women 's rights , how things have changed . 
  [ republicans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republicanism ) in the sense of supporting a republic over a monarchy . 
  the [ republican party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_party_ ( united_states \\ ) ) was only established 78 years later , in 1854 . 
  and by the way , then around 1854 , the republican party was the one to oppose slavery , whereas democrats supported slavery . 
  you may want to paint the republicans as universally bad guys , but the real history is more complicated than that . 
  i do n't think gay people want to be raped any more than straight people do . 
   we took in 200.000 over the last 5 years so first you take them , and now you want to give them away ? 
  when we say first country , it does n't necessarily need to be independent country . 
  but first independent country with universal suffrage was norway in 1913 . 
   this is bullshit it was new zealand in 1893 . 
  in new zealand before 1919 women could vote , but could not run as candidates . 
  so women could vote but all candidates were men . 
  i would n't call this universal suffrage . 
   considering finland a nation as it was part of the russian empire at this point . 
  in 1893 new zealand was crown colony of new zealand , part of the british empire . 
   australia allowed women to vote & hold offices in 1902 but only white women . 
  for all women , it took until 1962 . 
   but finland definitely was not a country at the time so e.g. 
  scotland is not a county either ? 
  wikipedia disagrees . 
   first country to give women the vote , that was new zealand in 1893 this is about full suffrage ( right to vote and to be elected ) , which happened in new zealand in 1919 . 
   and what language pronounces y as \u00fc ? 
  finnish, 
  so in uk gyms the tv screens show tea and crumpets videos ? 
   o \u00d3 \u00d6 \u0150 u \u00da \u00dc \u0170 i \u00cd e \u00c9 a \u00c1 but you are cheating , your \u00f3 is just oo , \u0151 is just \u00f6\u00f6 , and so forth . 
  ( the slanted accent marks a long vowel . ), 
  so actually you only have \u00f6 and \u00fc . 
  and \u00fc is just a way to write y , so actually you only have \u00f6 . 
  but it 's part of us all right . 
   everything apart from rainforest [ puerto rico ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rico ) has tropical rainforests . 
   this whole idea that the eu is `` winning '' by making it harder for americans ( who by and large are progressive if they are visiting europe ) is all sorts of backwards . 
  it 's almost as if europe had its own redneck movement . 
  do you always order your mayo with french fries ? 
   ussr did n't have any other non-warsaw pact countries bordering them iran , afghanistan , pakistan , china , mongolia , north korea . 
   we have not gone through the hell of being ruled by ussr czar   stalin, 
   dodging the draft is quite feasible if only dodging russia were as easy . 
   hawaiian pizza hawaiian pizza is pretty common at least in the nordic countries . 
  that , and also eating spaghetti with ketchup . 
  in general , the opposition 's confidence in the finnish government has been very low . 
  and they keep on repeating how they have lost even more confidence in the government .
