  which is funny , since it is not the principal role of the opposition to have confidence in the government in the first place . 
  in short , not sure if our opposition knows how to oppose . 
  [ rye bread in finland ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=smusx8airyy ), 
  the right side is how i got it in the dicker engel in moabit in berlin . 
  that whole mess would not have developed nearly that far , unless there were * some * people who thought that pakistanis can do no wrong . 
  not all of uk , but too many still . 
  [ chinese pork buns ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cha_siu_bao ) are good , though . 
  only the genus [ aythua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aythya ) , which does n't seem to have a name in english . 
  aythua is one of the three genuses ( genii ? ), 
  in the subfamily aythyinae , which does have an english name : diving ducks .

  all ? 
  i do n't see any plan to conquer finland . 
  does anyone actually believe in this ? 
  yes, 
   in brief , europe 's political fragmentation spurred productive competition . 
  but the article gives no explanation , why europe had this political fragmentations , and for example china did not . 
  however , jared diamond in * guns , germs and steel * says that this is a direct result of geography . 
  europe is geographically fragmented , divided into separate areas by mountain ranges , and some parts also divided by the sea ( iberian and italian peninsulas , the british isles ) . 
  a central power in [ china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haijin ) or [ japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sakoku ) can afford to be xenophobic and ban foreign trade on a personal whim . 
  but if a small kingdom in europe did that , it would fall behind its neighbors and probably be conquered . 
  because of geographical fragmentation , no single central power ever managed to conquer all of europe under one rule . 
  it 's easy to say that , as long as russians are not buying land next to your military sites . 
   i wonder if i 've ever discussed politics with someone who did the same and we both bullshitted about voting for clinton you guys need a secret handshake or something . 
  which side of the bosphorus ? 
  i wonder if muslim terrorists actually read the_donald ? 
  so the old soviet psyops puppets ( far left ) and the new russian psyops puppets ( far right ) are now protesting against each other all around in the western countries . 
   ketchup on their pasta all nordic countries do this . 
   pineapple on their pizza . 
  and half of the nordic population does this , too . 
    drink sprite with wine   please , tell me this is just a manner of speak and no one is actually doing that . 
  but all of southern europe drinks [ coke with wine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalimotxo ) , is that much different ? 
  and most of the western europe drink [ sprite with beer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shandy ) . 
  because america hates our version of football !, 
  the imperial russia did n't draft from ( the grand duchy of ) finland , so not that many finns would have died in the russian army . 
  but right after , in 1918 , we have a civil war in finland , and killed 1.2 % of our population , so at least we got that . 
  an american who does n't know how to spell america ... 
  the [ original data ] ( http://gallup-international.bg/en/publications/2015/220-win-gallup-international\u2019s-global-survey-shows-three-in-five-willing-to-fight-for-their-country ) does n't seem to include norway . 
   has science gone too far ? 
  whatever science they had in 1808 , when the heritable condition resulting in an increased number of muscle fibers was first observed . 
   6 years for trying to join a terror organization and attempted murder ? 
  how do these things work in other countries ? 
  in finland , a nominal 6 year-sentence for a young first-timer would mean 2 years in prison and then released on probation for the last 4 years . 
  first-timers in general would get to sit 1/2 of the sentence , but 1/3 if they are young . 
  also finland defines a first-timer as anyone who has not been in prison in the last 3 years . 
  so you can even be on probation and still be sentenced as a first-timer . 
  have you ever mistaken the american republican party for communists ? 
   we could actually make the eu useful . 
  maybe even great !, 
   the uk will start a tax war   the eu will need to retaliate putin must be happy . 
  do we take the swedes in , too ? 
   is there some democratic procedure , where voters in smaller states would n't feel outvoted by voters in larger states ? 
  if the members of the commission were elected in their countries , there would still be the same number of commissioners . 
  but they would need to take into account the next elections , and what people think of them , in their work . 
   on a serious note , why does your government put so high taxes for alcohol products ? 
  so that people would drink less . 
  experts in national health say that there is a visible correlation between alcohol prices and alcohol consumption , and between alcohol cosumption and alcohol-related health problems . 
   strangely , his idea how to prevent girls from masturbating did n't catch on . 
  * in females , the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid ( phenol ) to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement .

   its just meat shaped like cute dinosaurs and a pickle shaped like octopus !, 
   britain watches over us it is the way a creepy violent stalker who wont take no for an answer watches over his victim . 
  would you like to exchange your britain to our russia ? 
  greetings , finland . 
   only argument against us belonging to the northern europe is the 50 year long soviet occupation and your flag . 
   we get migrants we do not want but merkel wanted the migrants , no ? 
   actually there is a considerable number of blonde haired turks who are blue or green eyed . 
  even kemal atat\u00fcrk himself had blonde hair and blue eyes . 
  is it racist to dislike nazis ? 
   it comes across as a derogatory and generalising term whatever term you use for that group of people who do bad things , in a couple of years that term will come across as derogatory , because it will be associated to the people who do bad things . 
  looks like it is , in practice . 
   two years for a hate killing ? 
  you need to know two things : ( 1 ) sentences for violence are generally very lenient in the nordic countries . 
  ( 2 ) in this case , they judged that there is not enough evidence to link the death to the assault , so the sentence is only for the aggravated assault . 
  this may change in a higher court . 
  ( also , people normally actually sit in prison only for half of the sentence , so in this case one year . 
  then they are released on probation . ), 
   the airport is due to close when the new berlin brandenburg airport opens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_tegel_airport, 
  maybe one person stole the truck and shot the driver , and then gave the truck to another person for the attack ? 
  how can we know . 
   sweden will be next not long form now there was a [ bomb attack in 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings ) in sweden , but the terrorist managed to only kill himself . 
   now our only goal is to find a country as easily bribable as nauru i hear greece might have a need for some extra money . 
   i do n't really get that last part . 
  what do you mean that they have to take it as a loss ? 
  greece can not pay back its debts . 
  so in the current situation , whoever loans money to greece will lose that money , so it 's more like a donation than a loan . 
  what are the re-offence rates in europe and in usa for sex offenders ? 
   libya does n't really have to government or facilities to allow such a return nor does libya have the facilities to prevent such a return . 
   it absolutely should be illegal , and rags like the sun should be banned altogether . 
  are you sure censorship of the press would not cause more problems than it solves ? 
  / r/de please help us in / r/finland against the mighty / r/russia !, 
  when you have outlived your usefulness we will totally not turn against you and will totally not expel you from our beautiful northern sub . 
   the slavs [ ... ] can squat on these hills as well as anywhere else . 
   by to way , is n't compulsory education until 9th grade also in finland ? 
  it is compulsory to get an education , but attending a public school is not compulsory . 
  the national board of education has a [ this page ] ( http://www.oph.fi/saadokset_ja_ohjeet/ohjeita_koulutuksen_jarjestamiseen/perusopetuksen_jarjestaminen/kotiopetus ) ( in finnish ) explaining how they monitor that homeschooled children learn the same curriculum . 
  this is extremely rare , but it 's not illegal . 
  that 's another thing , they already made germany great again once and they do n't seem to want to try again . 
  i understand that because of their peculiar history , germans do n't consider sieg hail to be protected free speech . 
  maybe attending a public school is mandatory in germany exactly so that private sieg hail schools would not start popping up .
