  just a guess . 
  what about homeschooling ? 
  or is it mandatory in germany for kids to attend a public school ? 
  america recently decided to [ require alternative treatment labels to acknowledge the lack of scientific founding of their claims ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/homeopathic-remedies-now-require-disclaimers-saying-they-are-not-scientific-180961183/ ) . 
  unfortunately , several european countries are much more sympathetic to homeopathy . 
  in some countries ( i think france , germany ) , the national health insurance can also cover homeopathic treatments . 
  the europarliament probably has too many representatives who support homeopathy so that we could do anything about it . 
   modern trade agreements have little to do with the definition of trade . 
  they 're more like legal agreements . 
  there is only so much room to lower the import tariffs until they are zero . 
  after that , there are still other legal barriers to trade . 
  removing these legal barriers almost necessarily means some harmonizing the regulations and legislation in both countries . 
  being against the opinion of 107 nobel prize winning scientists is pretty much the definition of being anti-science . 
  you have beautifully demonstrated , and i commend you for this . 
  `` 107 nobel laureates sign letter blasting greenpeace over gmos '' https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/29/more-than-100-nobel-laureates-take-on-greenpeace-over-gmo-stance/, 
  `` aaas scientists : consensus on gmo safety firmer than for human-induced climate change '' http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/post_8915_b_6572130.html, 
    i am actually against gmo . 
    that is a completely fair opinion it is an equally anti-science opinion as climate change denialism . 
  do you also consider sweden a dictatorship ? 
  maybe it 's the word * national * that is not popular in germany ... 
  so the green party sides with cutting down old forest for the purposes of coal mining ? 
  it is retarded to protect the rights of such abusive communities to such an extent . 
  kids should be free to visit museums . 
  i stand by my original claim , that it is highly retarded for a judge to think that taking kids to a museum is marginalizing them within their community . 
  so edit your comment and remove the baseless speculation ? 
   i 'm wondering if one of these wonen was an ex of his or something like that . 
  killer is 23 years old , the victims are 36 , 52 and 53 years old . 
  so you 're probably wrong . 
  but is the judge also jewish ? 
  the retardedness of the judge is the main point . 
   triple murders are pretty rare , no ? 
  during the 11 years from 2003 to 2013 , finland has had 17 killings with at least 3 victims . 
  so on the average 1.5 cases per year . 
  14 cases had 3 victims each , and then 3 cases with 5 , 8 and 10 victims . 
  ( also 35 two victim cases , and in total 1178 cases , of which large majority is cases with one victim . ), 
  [ source in finnish , see page 14 ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/154148/katsauksia_1_2015_henkirikoskatsaus_2015.pdf?sequence=4 ), 
   rifle shots to the head . 
  actually , the article says : * `` the women had sustained gunshot wounds to the head and torso . 
  the english level of retardedness never ceases to amaze . 
   russians support russia !, 
  most of the russian expats i know , actually do n't . 
  talking shit and hoping no one will notice can be a good strategy . 
  it might even make you a president one day . 
  [ yes he does ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/19/trump-i-didnt-even-apologize-to-my-wife-about-video-allegations/?utm_term=.81499b1bad8e ), 
   us presidents woman i believe the post-stoneage word is `` wife '' . 
   our current president is an adorable hobbit with very little political power * yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world : small hands do them because they must , while the eyes of the great are elsewhere . 
  you have a talking spellchecker ? 
  well at least they get 3 more or less useful languages out of it . 
  in finland we speak finnish , swedish and english and only 1 on them is useful . 
   also , the french do have a tendency to hate whoever happens to be president at the time in finland we focus our hate on our prime minister , and the president is mostly left alone . 
  all the three currently existing ones are very succesful . 
  the three closed ones , not so much . 
   yeah there 's a lot of guggenheim museums . 
  three , actually . 
  talvivaara is an open-pit mine using bioheap leaching technology . 
  unfortunately it can not just be closed and left alone , as the existing heaps would continue leaking toxic metals to nearby lakes and rivers . 
  it has been estimated that properly closing it down would cost 400 to 500 million $ . 
  the finnish government is taking a gamble and hoping that infusing only 200 or 300 million would help to turn it profitable , so they could avoid the even higher cost of closing it down . 
   doing business with your family with government money . 
  this is a blatant mischaracterization . 
  the finnish government recently decided to give a 100 million $ infusion to the unsuccessful mining company . 
  the mining company used the p\u00f6yry consulting group to coordinate bids for an 0.5 million $ order of metalworks for the mine . 
  totally unsurprisingly , the bid was won by the largest and pretty much only metalwork company in the town of kajaani . 
  everything suggests that they would have placed the same order for the same metalworks company even if mickey mouse had been the prime minister of finland . 
  no corruption . 
  the parties in the previous government had fucked up so royally that the center party won the 2015 elections by pretty much saying nothing and campaigning for nothing . 
  it was pretty funny . 
  they also realized the situation and were clever enough to just keep quiet . 
   boring and uncharismatic ? 
  so , finnish stefan l\u00f6fven , then ? 
  there are only 3 metalwork companies in the town of kajaani ( population 37 000 ) , and looks like only one of them is large enough to easily handle a 0.5 million $ order . 
  it just happens to be owned by a cousin of the prime minister . 
  i do n't think this was a case of corruption . 
  / r/nottheonion does n't accept links from the washington post, 
   it 's a supply problem - there are n't enough houses . 
  helsinki and stockholm have recently had this weird idea about this , they are going to start building more homes . 
  all the way down to overproduction in agriculture . 
  nailed in . 
  so the estonian word for russia , * venemaa * ( boat-land ) , is just a translation into estonian , on how most of the other languages call russia . 
  and the finnish word for russia , * ven\u00e4j\u00e4 * , probably has the same origin as the estonian word . 
  edit : i guessed this all wrong . 
  holy shit , sami has contributed a word into english, 
  well , * vaara * ( hill ) and * vuori * ( mountain ) have old fenno-ugric roots , but * vaara * ( danger ) is a loan word from swedish * farlig * ( dangerous ) . 
  i would like to add some comments : - * vaara * means both hill and danger , and here in the context of naming places , hill would be a more accurate translation - * korpi * is rather backwoods than backwater - * terska * is the glans , though maybe `` head of penis '' is not too bad a translation - * vittu * rather translates to cunt , but yes it is used as an expletive in a similar manner than `` fuck '' in english - * vitunrenkkumaj\u00e4rvi * whatever `` renkkuma '' means , it does not mean `` improper '' . 
  this is such an old word that the meaning is lost . 
  `` renkku '' means a wooden support or stool , but the i have no idea what the verb `` renkkua '' would mean . 
  and then `` renkkuma '' would mean a place where some renkkua took place . 
  - in * perseenpaistama * , the `` paistama '' means a place of mooning ( flashing ass ) , not baking , although the word as such can mean both - * juostenpaskattu * means `` that which was shat while running '' , not `` shitting while running '', 
  i am sad to say , that we have had quite a lot russia-apologetic politicians in finland . 
  the most well known are ex-president halonen and ex-foreign minister tuomioja . 
  i think we mostly buy estonian vodka in estonia , but also [ finnish vodka ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/3030870/landscape16_9/1024/576/8137d9c22e7f896b7297b9607d51ea6f/dk/1798125.jpg ) is cheaper in estonia , so some people do buy that . 
   the uk wants to get the best deal possible , so i think it 's only fair that the eu also wants the best deal possible . 
  usually more free trade is the best deal for all parties . 
  in this case i do n't see the eu going for that direction . 
  punishing the other for petty feelings seems what 's going on here . 
  today op learned that some european countries actually discuss things in their own languages more than in english . 
  the swedish fermented herring , while itself having a relatively mild taste , has a pretty strong smell , which some people liken to rotten fish . 
  but it 's fermented , not rotten . 
   it may be that it needs to be nurtured rather than pushed away i feel all of europe is moving away from the optimistic `` if we tolerate them , they will learn to behave '' to the pragmatic `` if they learn to behave , we will tolerate them '' . 
  old habits die hard,
