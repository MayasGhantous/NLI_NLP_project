  [ also in new zealand herald ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11320415 ), 
   one requirement to get swedish benefits is to actually be in sweden probably more like , to trick the swedish authorities to believe you are in sweden . 
  which probably means visiting sweden at least 1-2 times a year , and maintaining a swedish address and a phone number . 
   british is the term used for people/things from the country the uk , like french for france or american for the usa . 
  there is the scandinavian identity , all the while denmark , norway and sweden are separate countries . 
  even us finns can identify as scandinavians , although sometimes a swede will pop up to remind that geographically ( most of ) finland is not part of scandinavia . 
  well it 's good to be aware of what the media says behind the iron curtain . 
  also , when potato came to europe , people were very suspicious and some priests preached that it must not be consumed . 
  today , europe is similarly afraid of gmo food for no good reason . 
  also [ garum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garum ) surely had lots of taste . 
  i wonder why it fell out of fashion . 
  [ russia admits having taken the guy ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/748380 ) , although they admit it in a very russian style . 
   it seems that healthcare and it are doomed to failure . 
  except that in estonia ( and i hear : denmark ) it did n't fail and they have actually managed to build nice systems . 
  in uk , us , and also in finland , healthcare it is full of failures , though . 
  i meant : how would the situationg change , as compared to now ? 
   800 miles of border of which the total majority is basically open wilderness to a nato country means that any operative to the western military union could basically just walk across to russia if and when they feel like it . 
  hmm , and why ca n't they do that now ? 
   russia does not want a nato member so close to st. petersburg . 
  this is nonsense . 
  look at a map , please . 
  estronia is already as close to st. petersburg as any part of finland . 
  but yes , somehow the finnish anti-nato discourse is half full of these false statements , that still feel kind of convincing as long a you only think about finland and russia , and totally forget that e.g. 
  estonia , poland , denmark , norway are already in nato . 
  i mean , if you do n't look at a map first , you might actually believe what / u/delicious _ cheese said .

  which products are ukrainian ? 
  how can i find about if any products from ukraine are imported to my country ? 
  i think it was thanks to american presence that after hitler was defeated , the red army stopped in eastern germany and not at the atlantic . 
  according to [ this blogger ] ( http://skibinsky.com/no-russian/ ) , the revolution in ukraine was significant because : * what happened is that first time in history , large group of ethnic `` russians '' had overthrown a mafia clan in a popular uprising . 
  * and if the ukrainians manage to have democracy and build prosperity for ordinary people , then the people in russia will also eventually start to question the rule of the mafia in kreml : * at this moment , kremlin can not really stop . 
  if kiev government survives , it will fairly quickly unlock economic benefits of non-mafia , free economy . 
  the large parasitic class living by bribes and extortion will be displaced : it will have the same effect as if base tax rate would suddenly drop by a double digit percentage . 
  next door , progressive russians would quickly notice and spread information about growing prosperity and opportunity in a city next door . 
  what was half million euro-leaning progressives , would become a million , then few million : before long you can picture a gaddafi-style demise for the kremlin gang . 
  * * kremlin is fighting for its own survival * so kreml is scared of russian people . 
  if the population of russia sees a working example of democracy , peace and prosperity in nearby ukraine , they will question the rule of kreml . 
  and mostly because airspace = weather . 
  well at least in ww2 , 2.62 % of the population of finland died , and 0,32 % of the us . 
  so we have been rather good in dying for us ourselves so far . 
  but of course any help will be appreciated . 
   america is an evil superpower yes you are , but if living in peace on our own is not an option , then we 'd much rather be dominated by evil americans than by evil russians . 
    will poles and balts be next ? 
  shit . 
  is it us then ? 
   only 27 % of finns wanted to join nato and 17 % were undecided . 
  but in my estimate , in this question finns tend to follow the opinion of political leaders , and if one or two of the major parties in finland would publicly change their opinion , i believe their voters would follow and change their opinion , too . 
  [ `` you 're in the snipers sight ... '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5caq37vyvw ), 
   finns never do something without deep underlying need . 
  and sometimes not even then . 
  third largest , i think . 
  but as far as i understand , denmark is much more open to the idea of cooperating with such a party and including it in the goverment . 
  i think in sweden the other parties will continue ignoring and shutting them out . 
   is n't the best restaurant danish though ? 
  [ in 2005 it was english ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world%27s_50_best_restaurants ) . 
   right now the swedish political consensus is giving rise to right-wing populism as far as i understand , the politics in sweden are very stronly based on a consesus system , and as long as the anti-immigration parties have less than 50 % of the votes ( currently they are at about 10 % , i think ) , it is possible ( and i think probable ) for the other parties to work together to keep them out . 
  and i do n't think it 's likely for the anti-immigration parties to ever get over 50 % of the vote . 
  which breed of horses do they use ? 
  i do n't know if you can read swedish , but [ a lot of the talk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/2ed6kj/flera_skadade_i_v%c3%a5ldsamma_protester_mot_rasism_i/ ) over at / r/sweden sides with the police .

  here in northen europe it 's the protestant who are much more liberal . 
  but , hmm , our protestant are [ lutheran ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lutheranism ) , but your protestant are something else altogether ? 
   i hate that movie what movie ? 
  i linked an iron maiden song . 
   i guess that people would n't care about independence if it would mean them being hurt economically . 
  as far as i understand , the [ 17 december 2013 ukrainian -- russian action plan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_december_2013_ukrainian%e2%80%93russian_action_plan ) was economically quite beneficial to ukraine . 
  but still the ukrainian people rose to a revolution , because they valued freedom more than a financially good deal . 
  [ freedom !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwltyvgdnbc ), 
  i think independence is a more important thing than whatever currency to use . 
   but social justice does n't mean social justice for gays , right ? 
  i think these things need to be taken step by step . 
  social justice for average people is already one step forward , and better minority rights will be some of the next steps . 
  but we should not too much condemn some progress , even though it does not instantly progress all the way to a swedish level . 
  is this so that in europe , catholics are conservative and protestants are liberal . 
  and in america this is vice versa ? 
   you can successfully introduce democratic socialism . 
  for example where ? 
   what most people do n't understand is that soviet union 's version of communism and socialism was badly introduced i think the key question is : is a socialistic system necessarily vulnerable to a takeover by a dictator ? 
  even if the idealism is nice , but the the system is too easily taken over by bad people , then in reality it will end up being ruled by them . 
  lessons from history hint that way , so probably for the time being , nobody has the courage to try their luck again . 
   that we ca n't understand our own language . 
  i have a friend who 's from bornholm . 
  according to her , when people from bornholm are interviewed in mainland danish tv , they add subtitles so that other danes can understand what the danes from bornholm island say . 
  so the ngo organizes people to fly to turkey and then sneak across the border to syria ?

  ok , there seems to be some difference between [ ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_corps_%28ireland%29#aircraft_inventory ) and [ finland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_air_force#aircraft_inventory ) aircraft inventories . 
  finland has 62 fighters . 
  ireland has a couple of transport planes plus some cessnas and helicopters . 
  then again , ireland has better whiskey than we do .
