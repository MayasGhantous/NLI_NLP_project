  * paradoxically , the military has both been an important force in turkey 's continuous westernization but at the same time also represents an obstacle for turkey 's desire to join the eu . 
  * * in order to meet eu 's political demands for starting membership negotiations , the copenhagen criteria , turkey has passed a number of reforms aiming at strengthening civilian control over the military . 
  * * despite the impressive institutional changes , the 2004 european commission report concludes that `` although the process of aligning civil-military relations with eu practice is underway , the armed forces in turkey continue to exercise influence through a series of informal channels . 
  '' * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_security_council_%28turkey%29 the causality is very indirect , but in a way pressure from eu has reduced the power of the secular ( but non-civilian ) elements in turkey , and tilted the power balance towards civilian , but non-secular , elements . 
  or perhaps we could say the the secular turks brought it upon themselves , by being stupid enough to try to conform to the european commission 's wishes ? 
  well , we already allowed us to meddle in the internal affairs of turkey when we discouraged the next army coup . 
  if the eu had not meddled , there would ( probably ) have been another army coup , and erdo\u011fan would not be in power . 
  so we already were the `` police '' . 
  if we anyway give ourselves the permission to meddle , at least we should support the secular forces in the internal politics of turkey . 
  what we now achieved , somewhat indirectly , was to give turkey a push towards theocracy . 
  not a good result . 
   we can not give up our core values i think allowing turkey to fall into a theocracy is a worse betrayal of our core values . 
  between 1960 and 1997 , turkey had the tradition of a secular military coup d'\u00e9tat every 10 years , when the theocratic tendencies of the current political climate got too strong . 
  i am afraid the eu took a too negative stance on the military occasionally meddling in turkish politics , and unfortunately this is what we get now : turkey falling under theocracy . 
  we in the eu should have thought this through better .

  so is your comment, 
   why does n't finland want to join nato during the [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) times it was politically incorrect to talk about finland joining nato , the leftist press would crucify the politicians who tried . 
  also today , the political left strongly opposes nato . 
  not so much because they 'd be loyal to the soviet union ( most of our left has realized the soviet union does not exist anymore ) , but because they oppose the usa . 
  do n't get me wrong , the political left in finland is not as strong as in e.g. 
  denmark or france ( which are nato members ) , but in finland the left is pretty uniformly against joining nato . 
  / r/europe can into relevance !, 
  i think your understanding is backwards . 
  after identifying the desirable gene , a series of cross-breedings is the more complicated procedure , and it brings along some hundreds of other genes . 
  genetic engineering is the more precise method . 
  you sound like `` genetic engineering '' would be a bad thing on some metaphysical level . 
  if genome-scan assisted cross breeding and genetic engineering produce very similar results , why would you still want to regulate the other much harder ? 
   probably less than gm crops and why is that ? 
   [ http://phys.org/news/2012-10-superweeds-linked-herbicide-gm-crops.html] ( http://phys.org/news/2012-10-superweeds-linked-herbicide-gm-crops.html ) i am not going to refute this study without reading it , and the criticism that followed , first . 
  but i point out that [ wikipedia gives links to sources that criticize both the study , and the objectivity of the researcher ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chuck_benbrook#research ) . 
  and [ here is some rather strong criticism of his earlier research ] ( http://www.biofortified.org/2009/11/does-using-gmos-really-increase-pesticide-use/ ) . 
  ok , so when the first non-gmo herbicide resistant crop appears , should it be in your opinion heavily regulated like gmo plants today , or lightly regulated as non-gmo plants today ? 
  edit : non-gmo herbicide resistant traits [ already exist ] ( http://osuwheat.com/tag/clearfield/ ) . 
  but even if all gm was totally banned , the same companies would continue to produce the same insecticides anyway . 
   [ http://www.nature.com/news/case-studies-a-hard-look-at-gm-crops-1.12907] ( http://www.nature.com/news/case-studies-a-hard-look-at-gm-crops-1.12907 ) let me quote from this article : * `` but herbicide resistance is a problem for farmers regardless of whether they plant gm crops . 
  some 64 weed species are resistant to the herbicide atrazine , for example , and no crops have been genetically modified to withstand it '' * * `` on balance , herbicide-resistant gm crops are less damaging to the environment than conventional crops grown at industrial scale . 
  '' * * `` using chemicals to control weeds is still more efficient than ploughing and tilling the soil , and is less environmentally damaging . 
  '' * heavy reliance on one single herbicide will always result in weeds developing resistance , because of evolution . 
  the story would be exactly the same , and the problems would be the same , even if the herbicide resistant crop was developed with some other methods than gm . 
  you are saying that because of your personal fears , we should ignore what science and scientists say , and that our legislation should serve the fears , and not be based on the opinion of the experts . 
  i know , that reads in [ the link i gave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crop_desiccation ) . 
  but you are quoting it wrong , wikipedia says `` thus in the uk 78 % of oilseed rape is desiccated before harvest , but only 4 % in germany '' so the 4 % applies to oilseed rape in germany , not all crops . 
   how am i hurting people or the enviroment ? 
  about in the same way , that anti-vaccine activists are hurting other people 's health . 
   just because lots of conspiracy sites cover gmo related topics does n't automatically mean all people doubting the positive effects of gm crops wear a tin foil hat . 
  maybe you should find one link to a non-tinfoilhat site , then ? 
   i will use the word pesticide from now on not a good idea . 
  then you will talk about pesticide resistant crops , and some people associate pests only with insects , so in their eyes you will talk about insecticide resistant crops , which sounds plain stupid . 
   i think these crops have a huge potential but we need to regulate them hard . 
  genomic scans are getting cheaper and faster , and soon the same properties that gm has been used for , can be introduced by searching for a candidate gene in close relatives , or in radiation-induced mutants , and then bringing the gene over by traditional crossing . 
  it will not be as precise and clean , as a couple hundred other random genes will also come along . 
  but it will not be gm , so it will not be subject to 10 year legal battless for obtaining permits , and other extra tight regulation . 
  so then crop companies can introduce the same features , that you are afraid of , without using gm . 
  do n't you think hard regulation for gm , but not for other plant breeding methods , is kind of stupid in this context ? 
   herbicide use increased though since most farmer use only one type of herbicide ( mostly glyphosfate - round up ) herbicide use -- when measured in kilograms -- usually increases when replacing the other more nasty chemicals with glyphosate . 
  the other poisons are much more potent per kilogram . 
  so using glyphosate increases the weight of the herbicides used , but is still and overall win for the environment and for the consumer . 
   they are frequently used with gm crops . 
  that is just evil propaganda . 
  they are used with any kind of crops , no special link to gm whatsoever . 
   glyphosate-resistant crops , which make up the majority of gm crops , increase the use of glyphospate pesticides . 
  actually , being able to use glyphosate usually means reducing the need for other , way more nasty , chemicals . 
  so what you say is true in the narrow sense , but the opposite of truth in a wider sense . 
  [ * `` the development of glyphosate-resistant ( roundup ready ) plants has changed the herbicide use profile away from the use of more environmentally persistent herbicides with higher toxicity , such as atrazine , metribuzin , and alachlor , and has reduced the dangers of herbicide runoff into drinking water . 
  '' * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetically_modified_food_controversies#chemical_use ), 
   the eu 's gmo laws are some of the stupidest decisions they 've ever made . 
  usa has climate change deniers , europe has anti-gmo activists . 
  each continent has their own anti-science nutjobs . 
   monstanto 's round up ready crops if you are afraid of [ glyphosate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glyphosate ) ( aka roundup ) , you should be aware in glyphosate treatment right before harvest , to enhance [ crop desiccation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crop_desiccation ) , is commonly used in europe . 
  probably in your country , too . 
  in plain language : the crop is killed by applying glyphosate , so that it dries faster and more evenly , and then it is harvested . 
  then you eat it .
