  was there a time in history when romania had a higher standard of living than hungary ? 
   a romanian on the dead bed i 've heard a version of this , about protestant and catholic football fans in glasgow . 
   what 's the stereotype about russians ? 
  oh , we have those . 
  what does not vibrate , and does not fit into ass ? 
  a russian ass-vibrator . 
   in norway we have pretty much the same jokes - but about swedes . 
  in finland we also have these jokes about swedes . 
  ( they have drilled a hole in the ice . ), 
  a finn , a swede , a norwegian , a brit and an american are in an aeroplane . 
  one of the engines stops , and the pilot announces that unless they lose weight , they will crash . 
  they throw out of the door everything they can , but it 's not enough . 
  the pilot tells that one person needs to sacrifice himself . 
  after some quiet , the american jumps out of the plane , shouting `` geronimo ! '' . 
  but this is not enough , the pilot asks for another sacrifice . 
  the brit jumps out of the plane , shouting `` long live the queen ! '' . 
  for a while things look better , but then the pilot says they still need to lose some weight , otherwise they all will crash . 
  `` long live the nordic cooperation ! '', 
  shout the finn and the norwegian , and toss the swede out of the plane . 
  it means : employer cost ( = how much the employer needs to pay ) per 1 $ of net income for the employee . 
  same here in finland . 
  and -- i would assume -- elsewhere too . 
  ( so it 's not misleading . ), 
   though i would n't call orb\u00e1n fascist . 
  a right-wing nationalist with a left-wing take on the economy , then ? 
   how can hungarians stand for this bullshit ? 
  the little i think i know about the political landscape in hungary , the options are pretty much the corrupted socialists , and then these homegrown fascists . 
  given the history of hungary , i understand that even a fascist feels a better choice than a socialist . 
  please correct if my summary is wrong ? 
  [ martin luther wrote some very antisemitic texts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_luther_and_antisemitism ) but modern lutherans have learned to ignore them . 
  i think how people choose to interpret the scripture is more important than what the scripture actually contains . 
  well i would assume that the public in northern ireland ** is ** used to seeing police officers carrying firearms ? 
  i think you mean great britain ? 
  because nobody from middle east wants to immigrate to your country ? 
  probably too high for motorways , if there are bridges etc. 
   i agree with this 100 % . 
  you agree with cafees where jews are not allowed ?? 
  i would like to see roller coasters per 1 million of population . 
   remember what happened last time they started marching armies all over europe ? 
  didnt end well for anyone . 
  then again , if germany and soviet union had not spent enormous amounts of military resources fighting each other , the red army had been strong enough to pretty much march all over europe by itself . 
  that might have been an even worse course of history . 
  both usa and russian militaries have shot down a passenger plane by accident . 
  and actually in 2001 also the ukrainian military made this error . 
  so it 's not only insurgents but also real armies that can make these mistakes . 
   fuck the poor well , in principle europe and the poor countries could also lessen the trade barriers ( customs and fees ) between them ,, 
  at least in [ the case of france ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140709/france-plans-to-get-tough-on-jihadists ) they have been french citizens . 
  so its probably difficult to prevent them coming back if they are citizens . 
  sd = sarcastic democrats ? 
  in [ sweden they have tried even 102 % tax rates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomperipossa_in_monismania ) but they are still doing well . 
  someone explain what that means ? 
  i hear they burn a lot of other nation 's flags in palestine , so maybe someone needs to burn some palestine flags , to keep things in balance . 
  in europe ( excluding russia ) , almost all groups of people who have their own language , also have their own country . 
   allowed countless wars to continue those wars would probably have occurred anyway also if unsc did n't exist . 
  i do n't think it is apartheid , if the people voluntarily close themselves in the new country . 
  in your link , the central government decided to enclose ( probably against their will ) other people in those enclaves . 
   orania ah , you mean this orania http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orania,_northern_cape, 
  what does that mean ? 
  what about directly targeting wealth through taxation , instead of targeting skin color because it correlates with wealth ? 
  in your scheme , a poor white kid of poor white parents will be discriminated against , because he has the same skin color as some rich people . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but my understanding of the history of south africa is that it was colonized from the south by white europeans , and from the north by black bantu people ( [ bantu expansion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bantu_expansion ) ) roughly at the same time . 
  so the white culture , and the currently dominating black bantu culture , arrived at those area roughly at a same time . 
  previously there were other black people , for example [ khoisan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khoisan ) , there but they were pretty much crushed both by the whites and by the bantu blacks . 
  i wonder what is left of them these days ? 
  so your attempted comparison to modern day chinese immigrants is very inaccurate . 
   in a more positive light this can be interpreted as a redistribution of wealth in a very unequal society . 
  nevertheless , it will lead to situations were individuals are valued not based on individual merit , but as a members of a racial group . 
   the few hundreds of orania should become independent as well ? 
  actually , there are almost 5 million whites in south africa , so they are an ethic group very similar in size to the population of finland . 
  and in total there are about 11 million non-blacks in south africa , out of total population of 55 million . 
   i cant be expected to pay for the sins of my forefathers i am sorry mate , but the world is not always a fair place , and most probably you will be expected to pay . 
  i think modern germany is nowadays mostly free from the bad nazi karma , but it 's been almost 70 years from 1945 now . 
  the south africa apartheid ended only in 1991 ( about 33 years ago ) . 
  so i guess you need to wait 20 -- 30 years still , so that people will no longer automatically consider you as the bad guys in every story . 
   i ended up none the wiser about what `` afrikaner freedom '' is supposed to mean . 
  it 's hidden near the end of part 2 ( and so part 1 is kind of badly named , as it does ' t explain what the term means at all ) , but it means the idea of white south africans getting a small part of the current south africa , and establishing their own state . 
  * `` a detailed genetic analysis of the microbial inhabitants of the penis among a group of ugandan men '' * * `` while the men showed similar communities of microbes before the operation , 12 months later , the circumcised men harbored dramatically fewer bacteria that survive in low oxygen conditions . 
  * '' i wonder , if a similar effect could be obtained if the ugandan uncircumcised men got a chance to wash their genitals more often . 
   reddit wo n't shut the hell up about and cutting of pieces of babies penises ( without their consent ) is not something we even should ever shut the hell about . 
  btw , does anyone know , if a jewish family does not want to circumcise their son , would they face discrimination from other jews ? 
  you need to watch [ starting at 23 seconds ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n5thrsp4hm#t=23 ) to see the event . 
  also the the `` right wing '' party in finland , perussuomalaiset ( `` true finns '' ) , is pretty much a leftist populist party in economic issues . 
  [ turku ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turku ), 
  have n't several millions from the easter part moved to \u0130stanbul area ? 
   well , one of the reasons he came to power was because of the steps taken to join the eu . 
  military was seen as non-democratic and it did n't fit the bill . 
  yes , the military was a nice secular and balancing force in turkish politics . 
  and the turkish generals were level-headed and after a coup they always voluntarily gave the power back to a democratically elected civilian government . 
  it was a big mistake by eu to meddle with this process . 
  well , if baku has something against female gamers , i would expect them to take the world championship games to some other place . 
   whether there actually are female players of this digital collectible card game [ yes there are ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/29kvuv/a_friend_just_linked_me_this_and_you_must_be/cim0x0b ), 
  yes it does . 
  in principle , this kind of backwards sexism should not be allowed , and it 's already generating somewhat of a media shitstorm . 
  and in practice , it 's a fucking * computer game * so the player 's sex absolutely does not matter .

   ... and applied certain adjustments to estimate the average iq of the whole population . 
  i guess the researcher normalized the iq test data with uk = 100 , and then from iq test data took additional steps to estimate the mean iq of the country 's population . 
   first , well-functioning institutions do not always translate into competitiveness . 
    [ ... ]   second , leadership matters . 
  so his solution would be to have less well functioning public instituotions , and hope that that would improve competitiveness and leadership in the private companies ?
