  i agree that the finnish companies may have problems in they competitiveness and leadership ( and salesmanship ) , but i do n't see how changing the public sector could fix this problem . 
  also the old cold war are communists still support whatever russia does , out of habit . 
   other cultures do n't treat women as being equal or having the same rights . 
  probably because no one asked the opinion of the women in those cultures . 
  no , no it would n't . 
   cultural relativism could you just think that punishing child molesters is an innate part of european culture , and be relativistic about it , and let them europeans keep punishing ? 
  do n't meddle with their culture . 
   it 's not normal you know , for people to starve to death because government took away their food . 
  not even in soviet russia ? 
   not a nice guy , russians are right there . 
  i would guess most of the pre-wwii heroes were not nice guys . 
  well this is not an easy topic . 
  [ according to this poll ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1396145259330 ) , support for nato membership increased from 18 % to 22 % , and opposition decreased from 64 % to 59 % , just from february to march in 2014 . 
  because of ukraina . 
  but [ according to this poll ] ( http://www.aamulehti.fi/kotimaa/1194894846425/artikkeli/iltalehti+nato-jasenyyden+kannatus+kasvanut+enemmisto+vastustaa+edelleen.html ) , 60 % would be ready to support the nato membership if the parliament + prime minister + president would support it first . 
  [ looks like ] ( http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/69868-kokoomus-vaati-kansanaanestysta-natosta ) the whole party ( kokoomus ) is quite ready to start openly supporting nato membership . 
  we finns are pretty conformist . 
  for a long time , the accepted opinion was against nato . 
  but now if the largest party and the largest newspaper start to `` educate '' the general population that the `` accepted opinion '' has changed , maybe the people 's opinion will shift in the coming years . 
   confident enough in him to make him the face of the party he is the most popular politician in finland . 
  number 1 in personal votes ( [ 148 190 , out of total 1 728 294 ] ( http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2014/eurovaalit/ehdokkaat_vertauslukujarjestyksessa.html ) ) in this year 's euro elections . 
  so they would have been stupid to choose a less popular face for the party . 
  * stubb is young and bold . 
  and very popular -- at least among the voters of his party . 
  he probably does n't care so much what older people think , and what the voters of other parties think . 
  * support for the political left ( social democratic party , left alliance ) is at a historic low , and probably will decrease further , so people on the right feel more confident in expressing their opinions . 
  * the recent event in ukraine maybe made some people to reconsider their opinion on nato . 
   no one else is reporting this . 
  and now that he is the prime minister , we can assume he will continue working towards that fine goal . 
  right wing , in the sense that they oppose eu and immigration , but center-leftist in their economic views . 
   after stalin 's death the baltics existed another 37 years under the su and that was n't exactly the worst place in the world . 
  it should be clear that the baltics would in any case have been better off without the soviet union . 
   stalin killed more than hitler but mao killed ( or caused deaths ) more than stalin . 
   the resources were sold off for next-to-nothing if something is sold for way below what it is worth , i would call that corruption , too . 
   yes , it 's the turks fault that corruption is the norm in romania . 
  well is the turks fault that corruption is the norm in turkey ? 
   it seems you have no knowledge of swedish whatsoever i am finnish ( the flair should give it out ) , i had 6 years of swedish at school . 
  i could write you this text in swedish , but then most other people in this subreddit would n't understand . 
  it 's difficult to compare to english , because english is all around , but at least definitely swedish was easier than german for me . 
  if you google [ ` language difficulty ranking ' ] ( https://www.google.fi/#q=language%20difficulty%20ranking ) or [ ` easiest languages to learn ' ] ( https://www.google.fi/#q=easiest+languages+to+learn ) all the results say swedish is easy . 
  maybe they are all wrong ? 
   studiemedel which is something like 1/3 grant and 2/3 loan he means the student benefit is something like 530 $ / month , but no-one wants to live under 1000 $ / month , so people need to take loan and/or get a part-time job . 
   swedish is a very hard language to learn bollocks . 
  it is [ categorizeg in the easiest class ] ( http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty ) of languages to learn for native speakers of english . 
   how great their country is and how shitty everyone else 's is i try not to do that very much . 
  but in a lot of countries there is some adjusting we need to do in daily life : the apartments are cold , the windows leak , the indoors temperature fluctuates , the * shower water * temperature fluctuates or you run out of hot water alltogether , the streets and pavements are full of fractures , and there is garbage all over . 
  sometimes the mail carriers just lose mail , or deliver to a wrong box . 
  you should have asked advice in reddit . 
   why could n't we also vote like this ? 
  because a * very * important thing in voting is privacy : you can vote whoever you want , and nobody else must know what you , as an individual , voted . 
  and online voting systems can not provide this . 
  it is important to realize that our voting system was designed right after the civil war , and each party can observe that no other parties try any dirty business . 
  our system has stood the test of time , and when the election rooms close at 8pm , even though the votes are counted by hand , we usually know the results byu midnight . 
   here 's a map of the city circle line and [ here is a real map ] ( http://www.trm.dk/~/media/images/subpage%20article/cityringskorttilside.ashx ) . 
  and one of the `` idols '' ( joel ? ), 
  was convicted of assaulting a 14-year old boy , in a non-political context . 
  i think the activists in the document are similarly perverted . 
   the left only attack fascists in the document , the left attacked two migrant workers from slovakia , who were in sweden working as a contruction workers building a hospital . 
  i can only give a [ link in finnish ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/naissyytetyn-karu-tarina-ei-ystavia-paivat-kuluivat-kotona-netissa/3401124 ) , but apparently she was a lonely , bitter misanthrope with mental problems and ** absolutely no right-wing connections ** . 
  or pretty much any connections at all . 
  for some reason this post [ in the swedish subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/26j7a5/the_good_violence/ ) is being downvoted heavily . 
  i 'd like to understand why ? 
    democratize the economy . 
   what does that mean ? 
  it probably means socialism . 
  the voting population is more pro-eu than the non-voting population , so low turnover actually means less eurosceptic representatives in the parlament . 
  they should also ban the import of oil from some bad countries . 
   i 'm also pretty tired of the `` muslim is n't a race '' quip is scientologist a race ? 
  [ pkk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_workers%27_party ) you are from estonia , to you the communist flag is understandably a symbol of oppression . 
  but because of some funny history , for kurds the same flag is a symbol of protest against the oppressor . 
  normally it would not be ok at all , but in this context the communist flag is a symbol of protest agains the turkish ~ ~ f\u00fchrer ~ ~ prime minister erdo\u011fan , so i think they can be excused . 
  well , as long as erdo\u011fan is allowed to campaign there , it is only fair that the other side is allowed to voice their opinion , too . 
  unofrtunately it seems that in the coming europarlament elections , both the extreme right and the extreme left will gain more seats . 
  so [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) is not totally unfounded ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** in the 1970 's the police in iceland suspected a group of young people of two murders . 
  for almost a year , the police kept the suspects in solitary cells , interrogated them heavily , made them re-enact the crimes , tortured them maybe somewhat , until they got confessions . 
  in the light of modern forensic phychology , the police probably just managed to squeeze out false confessions , but the prolonged isolation and mental torture maybe managed to seed false memories , so that even today the suspects are not sure it they committed the murders or not . 
  currently , the iceland police can not decide if they should apologize , or just be quiet about this 40 years old mistrial . 
   deep fried heroin umm , what ? 
  maybe austria and estonia and other such countries , who have no problem letting africans drown , should provide ships and crew and take over the operation from italians ? 
   the sad part is that there are actually people who think like you in the world i just wonder how those `` eastern european conservatives '' feel about educated people continuously moving to the west . 
  if the east is such a superior place to be , why do so many people want to move out ? 
  the hat costs about 600 $ and the sword about 250 $ , and you use them about once in your life . 
  a lot of people just do n't buy them . 
   that is some bizarre stuff yes , but was not the point . 
  the point was , is that `` just rabid anti-semitism '' ? 
   i 've never seen a case of holocaust denial that was n't just rabid anti-semitism what about [ david cole ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwcojoj4rau ) ?

   unfortunatelly for many people gypsy and romanian are synonyms .

   where europeans get the idea that there is systemic , `` extreme poverty '' in the us a mystery to me . 
  tv series ? 
   if you 're rich you can save or invest and you wo n't pay tax on that money but a rich person who saves all of their money , instead of spending it , would not -- theoretically -- have any higher quality of life than a poor person . 
  because they are not using their money , just saving it .
