  i think the whole world should jump 1 time zone earlier . 
  even when there is 12h of sunlight , surise at 6am is too early and sunset at 6pm is too early . 
  i 'd rather have sunlight from 7am to 7pm . 
   sensation that the whole world was against serbia you do a bit too much ethnic cleansing , and most of the world * will be * against you . 
  that 's how it normally goes . 
  see e.g. 
  the history of south africa . 
  and gmo 's, 
  i do n't, 
   professional concerned citizen now that 's a funny concept !, 
  i think the post title is so overtly sarcastic that it 's a bit difficult to understand the actual point, 
  i have seen an english translation of this in a blog ( probably was in blogspot ) several days ago . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.theburningplatform.com/2014/02/25/solid-gold-toilet/ ) is one copy . 
  but only if we actually decide to do that . 
  ok , so in what sense are these ukrainian nationalists any more fascist than those russian nationalists ? 
  turns out , the ukrainian flag is not easy to burn . 
   really , north america is a success because it adopted european liberal/social democracies ? 
  yes . 
  the age of enlightenment geve birth to the americal revolution and to the french revolution . 
  the french revolution maybe was more important in europe , but they were based on the same ideological roots . 
  but if you only [ eat cake ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/let_them_eat_cake ) , maybe the french revolution is n't really your thing . 
  yeah , what gives a russian nationalist the right to call a ukrainian nationalist a '' * fascist * '' ? 
  it was 1917 , and most of the europe were busy killing each other anyway . 
  in defence of my own country 's ( finland ) history , we just had a civil war that time , so at least we were not killing many outsiders . 
   writers , poets , compositors , ... 
  in modern times , we should add computer programmers to this list . 
  how can czech and slovakia be so very much different ? 
   when the public is not educated enough on the subject i do n't know how you do it , but in finland we also have politicians who not very educated on the subjects they decide on . 
  me too, 
   [ mannerheim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) there was a [ tv show ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suuret_suomalaiset ) ( spin-off of the bbc 's programme great britons ) 10 years ago , and indeed [ mannerheim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) was voted the greatest .

  well at least * `` the court confiscated jones 's cigarette lighter with the argument that he clearly was not able to handle it . 
  wtf spain ? 
  i think the falkland people have pretty clearly expressed that they want to be british . 
  you mean police horse brutality ? 
  i think they are demonstrating against the political elite that is having a party at the president 's reception . 
  some vaguely leftist-anarchistic agenda , but not very well defined . 
   seems like the horses here confused because of the noise actually someone pointed out that the horse which later pushes the man , earlier at 1:26 was hit by a thrown piece of plywood or something . 
  maybe that 's what set it off running . 
   where 's the riot ? 
  my apologies , that 's the most we have, 
   is it just about independence day ? 
  yes . 
  while the president hosts an indepencence day party , it 's now almost a tradition that there are some demonstrations nearby . 
  but usually not this rough . 
  i have studied some turkish , and both the pronunciation and grammar are quite easy , because they are quite similar to finnish . 
  especially i hear that vowel harmony and [ consonant gradation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consonant_gradation ) are difficult to learn for other people , but because they work exactly the same in finnish and turkish , it was a piece of cake . 
  i do n't know if there are anywhere on the web a nice graphics of a `` family tree '' of world 's language families . 
  actually , for some languages , maybe not even researchers actually know where they came from and are they related to some other languages and how . 
   kuusi palaa kuutasi palaa palavana @jotakin six / pieces / of your moon / are returning / burning  kuusi kuusi palaa palaavat palavina @loaffi your moon 's / six / pieces / are returning ( plural ) / burning ( plural )  kuusi palaa kuustasi palaa palaen @spin0 six / pieces / from your moon / are returning / being burning  kuusi palaa kuustasi palaavat palavina @loozerr six / pieces / from your moon / are returning ( plural ) / burning ( plural ) notes : * using the plural explicitly makes it sound a bit more archaic , but both forms are perfectly acceptable * in finnish the word order is quite flexible , much more so than in typical western european languages * none of these 4 are in any dialect when translating from another language , it 's easier to first keep the word order unchanged , and that produces an ok translation . 
  but then one stops and starts to think , what would be the most natural word order in finnish for expressing the same thing , if this was not a translation . 
  the `` gothenburg scene '' of melodic death metal from southern sweden should also be relatively famous ? 
   is the only place on the internet reporting this the other answer to you has given 5 other links , so clearly liveleak was not the only place on the internet reporting this . 
   is it that hard on the inside ? 
   or is it just that the crust requires a serrated breadknife ? 
  the crust is kind of chewy and semi-dry/semi-hard at the same time , and in my experience actually easiest to cut through with a thin , sharp , non-serrated blade . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/product_info.php?language=en&amp;products_id=4207 ) is my favourite . 
  edit : that webshop ships it abroad , too . 
  edit 2 : but that shop sells the advertised `` j\u00e4lkiuunipala '' , too , 3 different options [ in this list ] ( http://www.suomikauppa.fi/index.php?cpath=23_25_99_340 ) . 
  5 years ago i took a drive along 84 from sveg ( sweden ) to r\u00f8ros ( norway ) . 
  some of the houses , not right along the 84 , but by the smaller roads around there , were flying the sami flag . 
  so i 'd say the southern reach of the sami flag on the link map is pretty accurate . 
   it would help if you talked normally . 
  :p i think having own language and wanting to be an independent country kind of go together . 
  i kinda assumed serbian is written with the cyrillic alphabet, 
   forgive and forget , right guys ? 
  yes you have been , mostly , forgiven some time ago already . 
  it 's our own politicians we 're angry at . 
  how do you know the order is not bosnian , croatian and serbian ? 
  both czech and germany are known for great beer . 
  eastern europe , not so much . 
  actually my swedish and danish friends make an amazing amount of typos in english ( of the e.g. 
  plane/plain type ) . 
  i assume because they have learned english `` by ear '' because the languages are so close as to make that easy . 
  we finns need to go the hard way of learning written forms and pronunciation separately , but that leads to less typos . 
   swedish is a difficult language because it 's a tonal language i speak swedish without tones ( with a finnish accent ) and the swedes ( also danes ) understand me just fine . 
  of course , if you 'd like to sound like a native speaker , then you need to get the tones right . 
  [ germany helped us to fight off the russians . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_finland_during_world_war_ii#finland_and_nazi_germany ) thank you germany . 
  but then you [ germans would n't leave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapland_war ) , so we had to fight off you , too . 
  greetings , finland . 
  no , i pretty much ran out of examples that i can think of . 
  what about turkey ? 
  12 % speaks kurdish as mothertongue . 
  turkey was established 1923 , but i 'm sure the kurds were there also long before that . 
  what about macedonia , independence from 1991 ? 
  25 % of population speaks albanian ( as a first language ) , but in macedonia albanian is an official languge only in the municipalities with lots of albanians , not in the whole country ? 
  are you saying that minorities that were present at time when a country was created should have extra privileges over minorities that have formed later ? 
  so how long should germany wait before making turkish an official language ? 
  100 or 200 years ? 
  what the hell , spiegel ? 
  4 % of germans are turkish ( 5 % of finns are swedish-speaking ) , and nobody would suggest to make turkish a compulsory subject for everybody in german schools . 
  letting people decide themselves what languages they study in school is common sense , not nationalistic . 
   spaniards already pay more taxes than most european countries according to [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp ) , no you do n't . 
  but in a relative sense , i think europe and america are still the best . 
  meaning , others who have done that business have been even worse . 
  i guess we operate on the assumption that a significant part of russians wish to become more western ( standard of living , wealth , culture ) whereas no one in west wants to become more saudi-arabian . 
  well the eu has also pulled some stuff ... 
  [ here is a table ] ( http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/79/ ) ( i just found with a quick google search ) that claims spain has never been a net contributor to the eu . 
  also , southern europe has a larger part the country 's economy in black market ( '' [ shadow economy ] ( http://go.bloomberg.com/market-now/files/2012/12/eu-shadow-economy.png ) '' ) , so even if you 'd pay in proportion to gdp , you 'd still be actually paying less than the more honestly tax-paying people .
