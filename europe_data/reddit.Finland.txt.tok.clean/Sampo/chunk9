  so if they want stupid laws and we keep quiet , they 'll just set those stupid laws . 
  and if we do n't keep quiet , they set up the laws anyway because they want to show that our opinion has no power over them ? 
   iran is clearly a lost cause with the current theocracy in charge . 
  well , the theocracy of iran is a lost cause , but the people of iran might not be so much . 
  also the persian people still have a lot of cultural heritage that is quite distinct from the arab culture , and to some extent also from muslim culture . 
  well , i agree that the chechens are probably not very nice people , very far detached from european values and universal human rights . 
  also religious nuts . 
  but , after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , the chechens tried to declare independence , russia just would n't let them . 
  after decades of fighting , there is probably not a lot of nice people left on either side . 
  sure turkey has treated kurds like shit . 
  but also russia has treated a lot of ethnic minorities very badly . 
  quite recently two wars against chechens . 
  and there are a lot of small ethnic minorities in russia that we pretty much do n't know about , and how well or baldy they have been treated . 
   be sure they already do not pay to the rest spain in proportion of that wealth and you in the rest of spain do not pay to eu in proportion , rather you demand more and more support from the eu . 
   why do you insist on ignoring our common language if you 've never been on the underdog side of a language political situation , it may be difficult for you to understand . 
  but let 's try this : think of people from eastern european countries , who were force-fed russian language at school during the cold war era . 
  those people are now 30 + years old . 
  even if they still know russian , would you consider them rude if they just do n't like speaking russian ? 
  even to russian tourists . 
   well , in that case how far can we go to regionalism ? 
  a region ? 
  a territory ? 
  a town ? 
  a neighborhood ? 
  an apartment building ? 
  if a certain area demonstrates that it wants independency , does it matter so much what is the size of it ? 
   turkey is a hell for kurds the same as when you 're saying `` turkey is a hell for kurds '' . 
  then `` yeah , so '' ? 
   also turkey is a hell for kurds also , kurdistan is probably hell for gays , and somewhat to women . 
  [ also when putin visits amsterdam ] ( http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/q71/988290_723982150964574_503589866_n.jpg ), 
  where ? 
  i guess offering a free starter salad make the restaurant more fancy . 
  but then price competition kicks in , so you need to downgrade the salad , and grated white kale is pretty much the cheapest ingredient there is . 
   but what person with a sane mind would drink green beer ?? 
  it was my first time in berlin and i was told that it 's a local specialty . 
  i am always for trying local things . 
  like , in copenhagen you 're supposed to eat the hot dog with chocolate milk . 
   currywurst i had a currywurst in berlin , and it was kind of a disappointment . 
  it was just a wurst with curry sauce , and the sauce was kind of bland . 
  also the green beer was overly sweet . 
  meatballs and mashed potatoes . 
  [ pea soup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pea_soup ) , with pancakes and jam for a dessert . 
  fish soup , usually made of onions , potatoes , maybe some other vegetables like carrots , cream and salmon . 
  pickled herring and boiled potatoes . 
  in case that was a joke : a good one , have an upvote !, 
  in case that was not a joke : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omon, 
  the eastern orthodox have n't had their [ 30 year war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war ) yet . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  still after all the fun times the baltics had with the russians , i would assume that the baltics would really like to identify with the european value system , and take a lot of distance from the russian value system , no ? 
  and the other one mentioned by wikipedia , levikset repee by sini sabotage : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntsmjxtaezw, 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kes%c3%a4hitti ) , that would be enkeli by tuomas kauhanen : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtbr77atd3m definitely not my kind of music ; is it just me , or is that kind of rap pretty lame for rap music ? 
  in finland ( and maybe in estonia , too ) we say `` kalja '' almost as often as `` olut '' . 
  i 've read the theory that because the chinese invented china ( porcelain ) , they had no need for glassware , and then they did n't invent eyeglasses , and thus people with high education had to stop being productive at a much younger age , when their sight started to deteriorate . 
   computers have to pay television license , as they can now watch state tv online . 
  in finland the new system is even simpler : everybody has to pay television license , even if they do n't own a tv or a computer . 
  - finland : 12.52 litres/person - sweden : 10.30 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption, 
   the more secular/western turks are also more nationalist i do n't doubt you , but still kind of funny , as in europe the secularist political faction is usually the opposite of the nationalist faction . 
  given the fast growth of \u0130stanbul , by migration , i 'd guess half of \u0130stanbul is populated by people from the anatolian hinterland now . 
   we do n't really have muslims you should give it a try , you 'd understand the discussions much better, 
  also , how many non-british bother to ponder the difference between united kingdom and great britain ? 
  some people even say england . 
  not-so-many-years-ago , finland extended grocery store opening from 9pm to 11pm . 
  i still feel a little sinful when i go to my corner store at 10:45 pm to buy food . 
   you 'd need to fill out a form to leave the state church in finland a group of activists set up a [ website ] ( http://eroakirkosta.fi/ ) where you can do that . 
  then they 'll print out and mail the paperwork , so you do n't need to . 
  i suggest you give sk\u00e5ne to dennmark , we give \u00c5land to you , and denmark gives helsinki a bunch of city planners who know how to set proper cycle lanes by the streets . 
  i guess under the current government in hungary , the roma do n't really dare to riot . 
  still , in current turkish politics , the kemalist faction is the most european in their values . 
  the other big forces in turkish politics are less european . 
   one more very non-european thing about turkey : pictures of ataturk everywhere . 
  kind of funny , since arat\u00fcrk worked hard to * europeanize * turkey, 
   system of a down yea maybe we should consider armenia a part of california, 
   plus a certain amount of guilt over centuries of colonial oppression the swedes adopted your guilt . 
  ( and now they are developing guilt of their own , since the immigrants they have taken are not happy in sweden . 
  so they have to take more to try ease the guilt . ), 
  the 1900 's was spent on learning that different kind of people can live together . 
  then 2000 's will be spent learning that not * all * different kind of people can live together . 
   the `` people '' voted for it , but it was the wrong decision perhaps , to get reasonably clever decisions in a democracy , you also need a reasonably well educated population of voters . 
  people have the leaders they deserve . 
  i wonder if people from backwards countries realise any connection between their backwards ways and lower standard of living ? 
   israel is country of ethnic/religious segregation did you change the topic , or do you mean that zionism means supporting the current politics of current israel ? 
  if zionism ( i am still not sure ) means the idea that jews could have their own country , it does not mean that even though one supports the idea in general , one cound not be critical of specific policies of present israel . 
  i am sorry but i still do n't understand how a country for jews is a much different idea than a country for danes , irish , hungarians , kurds ( who do n't have a country at the moment , but would it be so bad if they did ? 
  ) , somalis ( whose situation is ... complicated ) , armenians , koreans ( again , not so simple ) , and whatnot . 
  i confirm that the teacher vs. misbehaving teen debate is really huge at the moment in finland . 
  [ the quantum thief ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_quantum_thief ) by hannu rajaniemi is quite popular . 
  he 's a finn , although lives in edinburgh . 
  here 's a [ map of areas finland lost to the soviet union in the 1940 peace treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_peace_treaty ) . 
  i do n't think losing land is what you 'd usually equate to winning a war . 
  then again , we did n't lose more , so in a sense we won . 
  is n't the idea that each people have [ the right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) to [ govern themselves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_sovereignty ) , as coming from the 1600 's and 1700 's social contract philosophers ( hobbes , locke , rousseau , also benjamin franklin ) , a pretty foundational part of western liberal democracies ? 
  why would it be any different when the people who wish to govern themselves are jews ? 
  or does zionism mean something different than that ? 
  `` the sumerian military used carts harnessed to onagers . '', 
  ( [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sumer#military ) ) what could be more glorious than to roll into a battle in a chariot pulled by 4 [ onagers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onager ) . 
  according to the linked article from finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat , the political parties jobbik and fidesz would like a revised version of the history of the hungarian language , as being linguistically related to finnish and the fenno-ugric language family does not provide a glorious enough history for hungarian . 
  they would prefer to be related to some glorious warrior people , like the huns , scythians or sumerians . 
  i would n't call it lying if one votes following the group discipline . 
  group discipline is a normal established tool in politics . 
  yeah , why did n't they do that ?
