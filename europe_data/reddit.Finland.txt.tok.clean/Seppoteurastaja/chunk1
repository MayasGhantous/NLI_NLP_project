but if he was having a normal tourist clothing anyway , and had no idea that he 's gon na meet a president , what could he have done differently ? 
  ran away from the president because he was n't ` dressed properly ' ? 
  i invite op to come to finland where we can go to almost anywhere in jogging outfits . 
  hey , this is so fun , is n't it ? 
   gorillakrigsf\u00f6ring man that sounds funny . 
  the gorilla wars !, 
  slightly wrong , yes , because we did not exactly side with the russians . 
  the soviets gave an ultimatum that all germans must be driven out of finnish land , and if finland would not succeed in that in given time window , their army would come over to ` help ' to drive them away . 
  after the continuation war between finland and the ussr ended , finland was forced ( by the soviets ) to drive out the rest of the germans . 
  surprisingly , they did not want to leave fast enough and so started the so called war of lapland between finnish army and the german troops stationed in finland , mainly in the north , in lapland . 
  german troops retreated little by little and while doing so , burned many villages and set ridiculous amount of landmines everywhere . 
  a friend of mine got once fined in utrecht by a bicycle cop for biking in a no biking zone in the city center . 
  i did not know that was possible before i saw . 
  also [ ford mondeo 's ] ( http://kuvat.uusisuomi.fi/sites/default/files/imagecache/artikkelikuva_std/kuvat/poliisiauto02.jpg ) are really common , at least in turku / southwest finland . 
  i would but it 's too dark for my potato :(, 
  if there only would have been a ger - ned football final , this place would have been quite anxious !, 
  [ such an easy language , no ? 
  oh i would be so happy if we even had the 19c . 
  and so shall i obey . 
  in finnish it depends a lot where you are from , but here are a few i use : * keskell\u00e4 ei mit\u00e4\u00e4n - in the middle of nothing * per\u00e4mets\u00e4ss\u00e4 - in the back of the forest * tuppukyl\u00e4 - a typical small hickey village * ` jossain ihan perseess\u00e4 ' - ` in somewhere someone 's ass ' edit : on request of / u/thagirion , / u/suparandom , / u/hiisi , / u/the _ imp : * per\u00e4hiki\u00e4ll\u00e4 - in a sweaty-ass place * huitsin nevadassa - in huitsi , nevada * helvetin kuusessa - in a spruce tree of hell * jossain korvessa - in some backwoods * jumalan sel\u00e4n takana - behind god 's back * hevonvitussa - in a horse 's cunt * susirajan takana - north of the line where wolfs dwell * turussa - in turku . 
  also my hometown . 
  or if you live in helsinki , you say * keh\u00e4 kolmosen takana - ` behind the ring iii ' which means a certain highway that circles helsinki . 
  a note for the following years : the ` voter 's card ' thing is not needed . 
  its only job is to remind you that you actually have a voting right in the elections , and in some remote , mobile voting platforms it speeds up the voting process self a bit . 
  you can vote without the card , and the only thing the officials are going to do with it in the voting place is to throw it in a trash can . 
  i wondered the same thing . 
  during my five months in holland , i never met a dutch person who did not speak english at some level . 
  i would laugh to anyones face who says that finns and dutch people equals in english skills . 
  something definately wrong with this chart . 
  and a beer with that , please !, 
  so albania 's fascist logo is ... albania 's flag . 
  i find these posters quite good !, 
  maybe i 'm just secretly german . 
  but there are too many serious posters in the world already , why not try to make them a bit more funnier . 
  edit : the first thing that came to my mind from the last poster , was indeed the infamous `` ein volk , ein reich , ein f\u00fchrer '' . 
  yeah the bridges are what i first thought them to be found . 
  but i really thought that they are only up on `` special occasions '' , but seems that i was wrong . 
  shows how well i know my home city i guess . 
  can i ? 
  i guess living here all the time has rendered me blind to it , 
  turku also has it 's own flag , just the picture from [ the coat of arms printed on a flag ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/turku/article5244882.ece/alternates/w960/turunlippukaupunginkanslia.jpg ) . 
  it 's really rarely used in any other occasions than official city business though . 
  of course out bigots are not as hardcore bigots as the american ones , nor they have as much power in their hands . 
  but pains in the ass , none the less . 
   presumably these are optional ones that you have to purchase . 
  you are right . 
  all finnish stamps are not to be replaced with these , believe it or not . 
  high five , we commented more or less the same thing within 45 seconds . 
  you explained it much better though !, 
  that might be also true , but still i claim that the parliament does not fully represent the people of finland at the moment . 
  it does represent those the people who did vote for it , but for example that young people are more likely to decide that they will not vote ( too lazy , too indifferent , etc. ), 
  than older people , makes it a bit more complicated . 
  one can say that it 's the youngsters own fault for not voting when given a chance . 
  but gay marriage will be introduced in near future , as nowadays young people get older and the old bigots start to fade away . 
  could you also introduce gay marriages perhaps trust me , we would like it too . 
  it 's just that there are a bit too many conservative bigots in the parliament at the moment , so it 's gon na be a very close call . 
   it 's easier to swim across the atlantic than learning finnish . 
  ftfy, 
  i bet you are using the same * free * source . 
  same here . 
  during the seven years i 've had my licence to drive , i 've seen a cop with a radar gun maybe twice or thrice . 
  instead , i see that goddamn camera van at least once a month nowadays . 
   there 's no explanation for why turku is bad , it just is and every finn knows this . 
  can confirm . 
   except those living in turku . 
  can extra confirm . 
  turku is the only real capitol of finland . 
  we here just straight up say that the swedes always fight to the last finn !, 
  damn i so much hope that yle will revive this show at some point , with the new politicians . 
  putting up the white flag ? 
  how french of you !, 
  well our internal policy , which you do n't give a flying fuck about , still interested you enough to write a witty comment about it . 
  if it was so obvious that it would never work in big and mighty france , why would you even comment on it ? 
  and yet you still are continuing to comment on our internal matters , which do not interest you at all . 
  well you certainly are using a lot of time to write stuff on an internet discussion board about things you do not de facto care at all . 
  finland has been doing this for ages . 
  the government also gives you higher tax percentage the more you earn , why not the same with fines ? 
  yeah , definitely nothing . 
  in addition , for males in finland it 's quite normal to do the compulsory military service / civilian service after high school / vocational school when you are about 18-20 years old , and after that it 's ` expected ' of you to move out . 
  sauli niinist\u00f6 on roller skates used to be a thing in a comedic animation series about finnish politicians 10-15 years ago called [ itse valtiaat ( a word play of the word itsevaltiaat , ` sovereigns ' ) ] ( https://youtu.be/2ucm_mrve8g ) . 
  he was the minister of finance back then , and in the show , [ he was always seen with the roller skates on ] ( https://rulluisutaja.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/niinistc3b6.jpg ) , and very often smoking a cigarette . 
  yeah but usually we do not eat the sauna . 
  eat while having a beer ? 
  in a bar ? 
  most usually nothing . 
  we concentrate on the relevant thing . 
  i 've never felt ` european ' , because we like to think we are so far up north . 
  but when i started travelling more , i definitely felt like being part of europe ; i can cross country borders as i like , no one is interested why i 'm coming to a country x and in many cases can pay with the same money i use at home . 
  no joke . 
  it was frustrating to be an exchange student there and trying to learn dutch . 
  the most practical phrase i learned was ` neuken in de keuken ' . 
  location , location , location ... 
  i guess you realized it , but still ... 2000 swedish money ^ ^ tm , google translator is just being retarded like always . 
  that is roughly 200 euros . 
   finland tv station is not the only one broadcasting the show , and the show is created to bring in audience . 
  of course i realize this . 
  but pkn was not elected to compete in eurovision because of any particular tv channel that wants money . 
  it was voted , by finns , to be there . 
  i have not stated that pkn is going to win because of their song only . 
  just that ` nobody 's voting for these guys ' is quite wrongly put .
