  with that i agree . 
  but still i definitely would n't say that nobody votes them for their music . 
  for example , if other contenders are the same europop boy bands as usually , i 'd vote for any punk band just for their different music style . 
  huh ? 
  what part ? 
  in what equation ? 
  well as a 25-year-old healthy man , i can not say that i 'm not annoyed by most of the same things . 
   no tv station would waste airtime for a show that does n't bring in audience and hence , money . 
  but in case of this finnish state-funded yle , they get exactly the same amount of money , no matter how many people watch the show . 
  of course they will get judged by politicians etc. 
  if they are doing some shit absolutely no one is interested in with the taxpayer money , but they still can do what they do , without the absolute need of collecting as many viewers as possible . 
   nobody 's voting for these guys because of their music you claim to have pretty much information regarding other people 's music taste with you . 
  care to elaborate ? 
   the darkside of commercial television well , at least the eurovision song contest in finland is shown on a tv channel that is state funded , i.e. 
  does not advertise and is less affected by commercial stuff . 
  and in my honest opinion , they are not being paraded as circus freaks . 
  like / u/slugmilkshake stated , the band has existed a long time already and they are as legit punk band as a group of four human beings with down syndrome can be . 
  actually it is mandatory to wear a helmet while cycling in finland , though there is no punishment for not wearing one . 
  huh ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/iwr6cz4pr0m ), 
  ... no , majority of them really do not . 
  thank the gods no . 
  some drivers are walking public relations machines every time there is a camera and a microphone nearby . 
  that 's what i do !, 
  just trying to explain that it 's a bit stupid to compare things with imperfect and hard-to-measure units . 
  or when talking about temperature in general in a place x , mentioning the ` feels like ' thing as the actual temperature . 
   it is n't completely invalid . 
  i did not say it is completely invalid , but stupid nevertheless , because it is inaccurate and depends very much on the circumstances . 
  as a result , imo it is much better to tell two different things ( temperature and wind speed ) separately and not to try combine them imperfectly together . 
  let people make their own conclusions based on the two factors , as they probably know better on what kind of places they are going to be than the forecaster guy . 
  but imo it is not valid . 
  wind speed is constantly changing , wind chill is countered with proper clothes and it depends greatly on where you happen to be at the moment . 
  the only way that i 've seen it used in reddit . 
  `` yeah i had to go to school when it felt like it was -40 c , poor me right ? '', 
  yes . 
  edit : i mean , is it not obvious ? 
  if it is windy , be sure to dress in clothes that have a good wind stopping specs . 
  if it 's not windy , it still does not hurt to use those same , warm clothes . 
  no point in a dick-measuring contest on who 's got the coldest ` feels like ' temperature , because wind speed anyways changes all the time and depends very much on where you happen to be at the moment ( e.g. 
  in a forest , on a street , etc. 
  yes , that is the reason the wind speed is also very often told in the weather forecast . 
  well ... no . 
  then i would say that sacrificing your own comfort and well-being for fashion is a bit stupid . 
  to add on what / u/hiienkiuas said : also the speed of wind is constantly changing , and depends on where you currently are . 
  it 's a different world in a forest or on a street . 
  so imo it 's easier just to tell the actual temperature . 
  probably it 's yourself who knows best on how windy conditions you are going to spend your time outside , not the forecaster guy . 
  here they tell us the real temperature , and wind speed separately . 
  also our winter clothes are usually windproof . 
  yeah well . 
  you guys also do [ other things ] ( http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/imperial_vs__metric_by_nekit1234007-d5p0ou5.png ) in a weird way . 
  i was trying to act manly in a sarcastic way , referring to / u/pontus _ pilates ' comment :  in finland we give the actual temperature and try not to make it sound colder than it actually is . 
  let me re-word : the only place i 've heard someone to actually use this ` feels like ' nonsense is in reddit . 
  the only place i 've heard this ` feels like ' nonsense is in reddit . 
   happaranda why ca n't you non-finnish people ever learn your double vowels and consonants . 
  well , considering that an average public toilet in holland has a world 's smallest sink and a tap with cold water only with water pressure of a 85-year-old man , no wonder . 
  i think your saunas are not hot enough , 
  but ... 
  does n't the towel get like all sweaty and disgusting ? 
   i was more talking about a `` my car broke down , can i use your phone ? '', 
  - type of situation , i.e. 
  where someone rings the doorbell and you voluntarily open the door . 
  quite a few homes at least in apartment complexes have [ security chains ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u1wdndb.jpg ) installed to prevent those kind of things . 
  and now , try to guess which country shares a land border of over 1000 km with an aggressive eastern neighbour . 
  also so rich that oil money is falling down from their pockets . 
   but roads here have enforced speed limits , aka driving 10 kmh under the limit in traffic is cause for a fine . 
  whoa , where do you live ? 
  yeah on a gravel road such as this it typically can be considered rush hour if you see more than 1 car per 1 kilometer driven . 
  most of the gravel roads in finland are 80 km/h zones , as 80 km/h is the default speed limit outside of densely populated areas . 
  it 's the maximum allowed speed . 
  it does not mean that you need to drive 80 at all the times . 
  and there probably would not be anyone to actually govern the speeds anyway . 
  cops mostly do it in urban areas . 
  on the other hand , typically even gravel roads are well maintained and you can easily blast away 100 km/h or so on those , as long as you remember to brake for the steepest turns . 
  do n't lie that you have n't always wanted to live in a treehouse . 
  in big buildings , like apartment complexes and schools it pretty much is cheaper / the construction work is cheaper , as it can be made from prefabricated elements . 
   why wood should always be sealed , at least from the outside with paint on the other hand the worst mistake you can do painting a wooden house is to use some latex paint that forms a non-breathing , plastic surface on the wood . 
  the best case scenario is that the paint simply falls down in chunks after a few years as the moisture is collected between the paint and the wood 's surface . 
  the worst case scenario is that after a while the wood is completely moldy and rotten as it can not breath . 
  imo it looks like a nod building in c&c : tiberian sun . 
  well that was interesting . 
   we only have our ` big two ' - edeka ( 25.3 % ) and rewe ( 15 % ) . 
  lucky you . 
  in finland , we have 's group ' and ' k group ' , which control approx . 
  80 % of sales in groceries . 
  lidl has 9 % . 
  [ source in finnish . 
   what is wrong with k-market ? 
  duopoly , that 's what . 
  because ** free bucket !, 
  [ if this was in finland ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article7592765.ece/alternates/w960/oulu%20ideapark%20karkkijono.jpg ) , lidl would be handing out [ free plastic buckets ] ( http://www.ess.fi/incoming/2016/03/14/_mg_4101.jpg/alternates/w640/_mg_4101.jpg ) . 
   where are the polar bears ? 
  and snow ? 
  wait , what ? 
  people actually ask that ? 
  when i make pizza at home , ketchup acts as the tomato sauce on the dough . 
  and it does it really well !, 
  thank you for your valuable input : https://imgur.com/riddiuq, 
  this kills the fridge . 
  you might have hot rooms , but those are no saunas baby .
