  he also apparently supports an `` open door policy '' when it comes to migrants , which i find very unwise . 
  europe can not afford to take in more migrants or for example let islam gain any more foothold in europe , lest you want the growth of parallel societies , which become hot-spots for criminal activity , cultural clashes and extremism . 
  and with them comes the growth in extreme right-wing politics . 
  a repeat of the 2015 crisis combined with increasing amounts of terrorist attacks would almost certainly be the end of the eu . 
  there are many people who suggest that geoengineering and human ingenuity will get us out of this trouble . 
  i partially agree . 
  no matter what happens , there is no way that climate change could get so bad that humans would die out . 
  we will be sure to survive . 
  but there will be much adaptation , such as having to change some of the areas of agriculture due to new rain and temperature patterns , and migration due to sea level rise . 
  however , we ca n't just keep on going with our emissions and shurg `` well , future technology will save us '' . 
  i have no doubt that technology will help us , but we ca n't rely on that only . 
  even with advanced technolgy , it is better to act now than later . 
  more people will be saved , less species will go extinct , we need to adapt less and so on . 
  no matter what the cost of mitigating climate change may be , it will surely be cheaper than not doing anything about it . 
  so , climate change is a problem , but not the end of the world . 
  however , it will be hard and expensive , and it would be better to avoid it , if we can . 
  oh , and relevant : http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=b11kaspfyxy, 
  well , i 'd say it is more like this : ( hellish ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ( europe ) ... ... ... ( paradise ) or maybe i am just being overly optimistic or belong to high income class or something . 
  we indeed have a long way to go and many things to improve , but the details of how that is done seem to be quite unknown . 
  that is kind of what i meant . 
  if you look from a certain perspective , you might see it as unfair : `` that school gets better food than the other schools !, 
  this is unfair for the students '' . 
  but like i said , it is ridiculous . 
  i can understand that it might be `` unfair '' to other schools , but this is just ridiculous . 
  this is like ... demanding that others may not use the village well because it is too far away from your home . 
  you do n't believe in manmade global warming ? 
  and no gay marriage ? 
  you , i do n't like you . 
  my results : http://www.isidewith.com/results/98098142, 
  i am not sure . 
  it would have its good sides , but i am not sure if it they would be greater than the bad sides . 
  i would probably go for it , as we already have the eu , and we could easily just expand it and give it a bit more power . 
  at least as long as they do n't do something stupid like acta , and they know how to handle the economy and not just make some stupid banks and their owners rich while others suffer . 
  i am not very sure , but here in finland gay people can register their relationship , and gay marriage has been discussed , but not yet legalized . 
  there is of course some opposition , prejudice and even disgust against gay people , but generally people seem to be open-minded . 
  i am not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this , but i believe that daylights saving time is an unnecessary and obsolete mechanism that is ultimately counterproductive . 
  the little savings of energy that may result of it are negligible when compared to the unnecesary hassle with changing the time , interfering with people 's sleeping schedule which has drastic health and productivity impacts , and other effects of daylight saving time . 
  i saw a petition in the finnish subreddit ( / r/suomi , / r/finland ) regarding a petition to stop the practice in finland , but many commentors pointed out that for true effectiveness the practice should be abandoned worldwide , or at least , eu-wide . 
  is there an existing official ( eu citizens initiative or something similar ) petition that i ( and hopefully many of you ) could sign ? 
  if no , one should be created . 
  most of the tv shows i watch are english , mostly american , for a large part due to the english language being so influential online , making me hear about american tv shows more often that any non-american and especially non-english speaking shows . 
  i would love to discover european or at the very least non-american tv shows , so what are the best european tv shows still running ( or released after , say , 2000 ) ? 
  i am mostly looking for story-driven shows , drama , scifi etc. 
  instead of any sort of non-fiction , talk shows , or comedies , although if you have a great one to suggest i would love to hear it !, 
  edit : thank you all for your suggestions !, 
  hopefully even more people will contribute . 
  as of now , i think i will give a closer look to at least `` the returned '' and ministerio del tiempo . 
  not much . 
  address complaints about lack of democracy by making the commission directly elected . 
  other than that , i expect leaving will hurt uk enough to make others change their mind about wanting to leave . 
  finland : ** good : ** * all education is `` free '' ( paid in taxes ) , all the way from primary to university . 
  students , especially those in university , can also apply for student aid and cheap loans . 
  * pisa studies suggest that education before the age of 15 here is one of the best in the world , despite school being rather relaxed . 
  * long recess , not too much homework , much help available for students who do n't do so well , with no stigma . 
  * free decent school meals . 
  * universities not top of the world , but not too bad either . 
  * school quality is quite uniform all over the country , which means that everyone gets a good and equal education despite living in different parts of the country and going to different schools . 
  ** bad : ** * funding getting smaller . 
  * despite funding getting cut , there is plenty of new technology available to schools , but adoption is slow . 
  * lazy / unmotivated / misbehaving students , which is made worse by teachers having limited options for upkeeping discipline . 
  ** good/bad : ** * emphasis on equality instead of excellence . 
  this stops division to over - and underachievers , and ensures that no one is left behind , but it means that the brightest are not allowed to skip ahead to a new class and achieve their full potential , at least when it comes to school . 
  in many cases , the brightest do their work faster than others , and then spend the rest of the time doing whatever they want or helping those who need help . 
  * no private schools , which means that no one can get better education due to their social class , which increases social mobility and equality , but also diminishes the choice between schools . 
  fair enough . 
  but you are still misunderstanding my link . 
  the fact is , people commit suicide in different ways . 
  some people are very dedicated in their suicide attempts , and will kill themselves no matter what . 
  most suicides , however , are more spontaneous , and this is where it matters a lot if they have an easy and fast way to commit suicide . 
  there is no faster , surer , easier and less painful way to do it than by gun . 
  so when there are guns around , people commit suicide using them . 
  yet , when there are no guns around , a lot of the people who would use guns to commit suicide wo n't commit suicide simply because there are no guns . 
  they do not choose an alternative method . 
  they just do n't commit suicide . 
  it sounds strange , even absurd , but that is how it seems to work . 
  i think that the benefits of guns are mostly imaginary , but whatever , you have a right to your opinions and hobbies , as do other gun owners . 
   carrying a gun for self defense on the streets is different than keep a gun at home in case someone enters your house . 
  the chance of a home invasion , especially while you are at home , is very low . 
  it is much more likely that someone innocent will be hurt . 
  furthermore , when guns are less regulated , the invador is more likely to be armed as well . 
   i paid around 6 ' 000 euros for my guns alone . 
  i would rather have the responsibility of storing my guns myself than to leave them to the care of people that i do n't know and at the risk of being stolen by criminals . 
  i do n't want to offend you , but investing 6000 $ into something as inessential as weapons seems ridiculous and even idiotic to me . 
  yeah , sure , you like your responsibility and want to keep them with you . 
  but that is hardly an argument for anything . 
  also , the range would surely the weapons range would have some kind of insurance for stolen weapons . 
   guerrilla warfare is a valid way to show that a group of people with guns can wear down a more advanced enemy to the point where the war is too costly to win . 
  first of all , the probability of a government going tyrannical in a way that calls for guerrilla warfare is ridiculously low . 
  the probability of the guerrillas winning is extremely low , and i can not remember a single instance where they have actually won . 
  furthermore , most people would simply rather trust the tyrannical government and live with it than have an armed rebellion where they would go against a much larger military force . 
  in fact , they would probably be so brainwashed as to believe that the guerrillas are just terrorists . 
  as i said , iraq and afghanistan are very bad examples . 
  the reason why usa is leaving iraq , for example , is not because they are losing , but because the political support that was nil in the first place has run out , and the war has been costly , because keeping troops deployed in far-away iraq is costly , not because of guerrillas . 
  a tyrannical government would fight in its own area , and have no such problems . 
   tell that to the jews , kurds and all other people that were victim of tyrannical governments for the past 100 years . 
  guns would n't have helped them . 
  and in most cases , those governments were not democratic . 
   japan has about zero guns and an insane suicide rate the two are not related . 
  additionally why should n't i be free to end my life if i want ? 
  the method of suicide is n't the problem , suicide itself is the problem .
