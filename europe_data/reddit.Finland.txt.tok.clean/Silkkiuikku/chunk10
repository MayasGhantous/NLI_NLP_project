  well , they only live in one single lake . 
  and now because of global warming they 're sometimes unable to make dens in the snow , so their cubs die . 
  what the fuck do vikings have to do with the present day refugee crisis ? 
  when ? 
  yes , sweden used to be an aggressive empire that tried to invade poland and russia , but what does that have to do with these present day problems ? 
  no , but we * can * blame people for trying to murder a bunch of innocent men , women and children . 
  fuck him . 
  for a moment i confused her with the philosopher [ simone weil ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/simone_weil ) and was very confused since she died in 1943 . 
  - i just ca n't understand why people are afraid of us . 
  must be the media . 
  - could it be because you 've flogged , raped , maimed , mutilated , enslaved , hanged , stoned , crucified and burned alive thousands of people ? 
  must be the media . 
  you have a point . 
  but i just wanted to point out that even though racism most likely * is * a built-in survival instinct developed by evolution , it may not be a appropriate today . 
  those were just examples of other antiquated survival mechanisms . 
  holy shit , this is satire right ? 
  right ? 
   `` you in the media have scared them . 
  i do not know why they are afraid , '' said a jihadi from the southern city of malmo of the fears that employees and civilians had of returning foreign fighters . 
  killing , stealing and raping are also built-in survival instincts that developed trough millions of years of evolution . 
  that does n't mean that they work in modern society . 
  yeah , i prefer church bells . 
  they 're pretty annoying , but the minaret thing is even worse , it sounds like a crazy drunk dude . 
  well , only jews and muslims get circumsized here , so i guess jewish and muslim women probably prefer circumsized penises . 
  if there were only three or four civilized peoples on earth , i think we can say that they were indeed ahead of their time . 
  yeah , but what other than that did the romans ever do for us ? 
  it 's true that nordic countries which have short sentences and decent prisons , have low recidivism rates , but i 'm not sure if this works with jihadists . 
  most people in our prisons are alcoholics , junkies , thieves and people with serious anger management problems . 
  i 'm not sure if our prison system can also rehabilitate members of organized criminal groups , like jihadists . 
  is it just me , or does he kinda look like mr. bean ? 
  i just think that performing bodily modification on an infant should be a crime . 
  but do you think that it should be legal to cut off a child 's perfectly healthy tonsils for religious reasons ? 
  do n't they teach this at schools already ? 
  if oppression of women is the disease , then the girl wearing a scarf is a symptom . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the problem wo n't be solved by having racist polish guys also oppress them . 
  and how will spitting on women free them from oppression ? 
   i read the police report about this , this happened to a 13 years old girl . 
  seriously , what the hell ? 
  fucking racist coward picking on a kid . 
   the headscarf is still `` triggering '' for many people including obviously those in poland , perhaps they should have left them off or not gone at all ? 
  who the fuck gets so triggered by an article of clothing that they fucking * spit * on people ? 
  fucking fragile little snowflakes , that 's who . 
  i think that we have a moral obligation to help all the real refugees who are actually fleeing for their lives . 
  and yes , it will be expensive . 
  but i think that if we have to choose between spending some money , and letting people die , we should choose to pay the price . 
  there is a famous movie called * schindler 's list * about oskar schindler , a german who saved the lives of more than a thousand jewish refugees from the holocaust . 
  at the end of the film there is a famous scene , where a person praises schindler for what he has done . 
  and schindler thinks of all the people he saved , and realizes that with a little money and effort , he could have saved many more . 
  if schindler had sold his car , he would have had enough money to save ten people . 
  if he 'd have sold his golden lapel pin , he could have saved on more person : * `` this pin . 
  two people . 
  this is gold . 
  two more people . 
  he would have given me two for it , at least one . 
  one more person . 
  a person , stern . 
  for this . 
  i could have gotten one more person ... and i did n't !, 
  and i ... i did n't !, 
  '' * when this refugee crisis is long over , when our children and grandchildren learn about it in school , what will they say about us in the history books ? 
  that we saved thousands of people who would otherwise have been murdered ? 
  or that we stood by and watched as isis slaughtered all those men , women and children ? 
  that we let them die , and for what ? 
  a little bit of money ? 
   they say that some teachers have banned students from speaking finnish during breaks so how is allowing students to speak their own language during breaks `` a waste of money '' ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you do n't ban arabic , or iranian , or somali students from speaking their languages during break , so why is finnish banned ? 
  if you want karma , i recommend you post this on r/historyporn , it think they would appreciate this . 
  we 're the ballsiest people in europe !, 
  swedes are just a bunch of dicks . 
  the belgian staircase in the forest reminds me of that nosleep story . 
  we have some similar ones : * hammasl\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri * = teeth doctor ( dentist ) * tietokone * = `` knowledge machine '' ( computer ) * lentokone * = `` flying machine '' ( airplane ) * sanakirja * = `` word book '' ( dictionary ) * j\u00e4\u00e4kaappi * = `` ice cupboard '' ( fridge ) edit : added a few more, 
  surprisingly many of those are the same in finnish * kilpikonna * = shield toad * p\u00f6lynimuri * = dust sucker * sarvikuono * = horn nose * pesukarhu * = wash bear, 
  i think that `` running grave '' is a perfect word for `` trench '' . 
  [ telegraph article about parisian interior designer ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/29/saudi-princess-ordered-paris-interior-decorator-to-kiss-her-feet/ ) [ bbc article about saudi prince who killed his servant ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-11581728 ), 
  you too !, 
  according to the finnish security intelligence service there are about 350 `` counterterrorism target individuals '' in finland . 
  source : http://www.supo.fi/counterterrorism/terrorism_threat_assessment, 
  that sounds like a good idea . 
  unfortunately , it 's apparently quite hard to prove that they 've committed crimes during their stay in isis territory . 
  i 'd say that they were quite successful at gaining international attention on whatever their cause is . 
  but the video i linked is what they were arrested for , not whatever this is . 
  if [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzkabh9px64 ) looks like an orgy to you , then i do n't think you know what `` orgy '' means . 
  good point , i think you 're right . 
  neither should go to jail . 
  i do n't think that mocking a religion should land anyone a prison sentence . 
  good point . 
  the problem is that no one wants these isis members for obvious reasons , but it 's very hard to prove that they 've committed a crime and arrest them , so they just live in normal society . 
  i know it does n't work like that , but i wish we could send them to isis territory . 
  i mean , if they 've joined isis , why should n't they live in their caliphate ? 
  many people travel to syria , fight in isis ' ranks and them come back to finland . 
  i wish we would n't have to let them back in , they 're a bit of a security threat . 
  they were n't sentenced for disrupting an event . 
  they were sentenced for `` hooliganism against religion '' . 
  and no , i do n't think that people should get a prison sentence for disrupting an event . 
  i 'm sure they knew that they could end up in prison , but they chose to protest regardless . 
  it can be considered idiocy , or great bravery . 
   deport islamists straightaway instead of years later . 
  here we ca n't deport them at all if they 're finnish citizens , even if they 've joined isis . 
  sweden did the same , though . 
   a few hundred attended of which many ( or most depending on who you ask ) , again , were n't even muslims .
