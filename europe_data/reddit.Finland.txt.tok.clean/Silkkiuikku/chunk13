  they 're all zombies . 
  some of them march under the swastika , and others fly the black flag of isis , and they 're all mindless zombies . 
  but maybe one day they will learn . 
  to be fair , universal rights are easier to understand than economy , so i can kinda see why young people would rather choose that . 
  yes , what a great idea . 
  [ nothing bad ever came from that .

  so would it be okay to have a `` white feminist festival '' then ? 
  because i think that many people would find that racist too . 
  he was into the fishing scene . 
  those are basically really long rubber boots . 
  i understand your confusion . 
  is n't the context that racial segregation is wrong and illegal ? 
  no , i meant the [ `` mongoloid race '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongoloid ) . 
  i dunno , i think that segregating people based on skin color is always bad . 
  i mean , it 's a ridiculous idea when you think about it . 
  we 're all human beings , why should we avoid each other because of an arbitrary physical trait on which we have no control over ? 
  why should we let the amount of melanin in our skin decide who we befriend ? 
  i believe that equality has intrinsic value : it 's important in and itself . 
  if someone ca n't enter a place because of their skin color , then that 's unequal . 
  it would be racist to make black people sit at the back of the bus , even if the seats there were softer than at the front . 
  or nazism 's `` protect racial purity '' . 
  british colonialists are n't usually considered a good role model for anti-racists . 
  i 'm pretty sure that `` black '' means sub-saharan african , so asians , middle easterners , north africans , latin americans and roma are all banned . 
  that 's a good point . 
  but we all know that allowing racial segregation can go massively wrong . 
  if segregation against white people is allowed , then maybe one day segregation against black people , or middle easterners , or maghrebians , will be allowed too . 
  if we say that racial segregation is okay in some situations , we open a nasty can of worms . 
  i dunno , i think that trump winning may have caused everyone to have more extreme views . 
  i mean , trump is an enormous asshole and an incredibly shitty president . 
  because he rules the country now , many americans , especially some non-white ones , feel worried and even threatened . 
  so they demand safe spaces because they think that all the white people are out to get them . 
  that 's just my theory though , there 's no scientific basis to this , and i could well be wrong . 
  that 's true , it 's a pretty vague article . 
  sure , have a [ finnhorse ] ( http://www.ii.fi/instancedata/prime_product_julkaisu/ii/generated/b5444886866736f.jpg ) my aryan friend !, 
  i think those are just really long boots that go up to his thighs . 
  a big dog that can [ fight wars ] ( http://ruotuvaki.fi/documents/1951245/0/ratsumies_uutiskuva.jpg/5179e947-e966-47d9-9d3c-959e3fdfa220?t=1479111734495 ) . 
  it is . 
  a finnish newspaper published this photo with the headline [ was kekkonen a precursor of hipsters ? 
  what do you mean we lost our horses ? 
  behold the [ mighty finnhorse ] ( http://www.vastavalo.net/albums/userpics/14528/normal_3669_mg_2627.jpg ) !, 
  it 's docile , slow and child-friendly !, 
  perfect for battle !, 
  yes , you may be onto something ... [ - genghiz khan ] ( http://cdn1-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/marco-polo/marcopolo0007.jpg ) [ - urho kekkonen ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/11/01/99/11019927ba561a8d6d34be9b7184c541.jpg ), 
  well then , are you * really * sure that you wish to anger a soldier of the glorious mongol horde ? 
   is finnish culture more akin to sweden or denmark . 
  i 'm not really familiar with danish culture , so i could n't say . 
  here the public discussion surrounding immigration has become really polarized . 
  on one side we have all the civilized people who talk about things like `` safe spaces '' and `` cultural appropriation '' . 
  and on the other side we have the insane racist assholes who hate immigrants . 
  and there 's no middle ground , so people who do n't agree with the civilized people , end up sympathizing with the insane racist assholes . 
  yeah , does n't this kinda violate the first article of the universal declaration of human rights ? 
   article 1 . 
   all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . 
  and finns were considered non-white mongoloids until the 20th century . 
  here a feminist organization already had a `` no whites allowed '' event . 
  in * finland * !, 
  where more than 95 % of the population is white !, 
  we have never had racial segregation , and i do n't understand why people want to start now . 
  if they hate white people so much that they ca n't stand being in the same room with us , then why on earth did they move to goddamn finland of all places ? 
  they said that they organized the event because non-white people are scared of white finns , and they need a space where they can feel safe . 
  but would n't it just be easier for everyone if the immigrants tried to get over their fear , and get used to white people ? 
  of course no one criticizes them publicly , because that would be considered racist , and no one wants to be labeled a neo-nazi . 
  what a great idea !, 
  europe is so backwards when it comes to issues of race . 
  i love that we 're adopting these progressive american ideas . 
  i think that in order to combat racism , we should also adopt segregated schools , segregated hair saloons , segregated drinking fountains ... why should we listen to all those right-wingers and neo-nazis who preach about `` tolerance '' and `` multiculturalism '' ? 
  yeah , no more of that oppressive diversity stuff !, 
  separate but equal !!!, 
  what ? 
  that story was about the odessa catacombs , though , not the paris catacombs . 
  and the story does n't seem very reliable , there does n't seem to be any newspaper articles about it . 
  no they would n't . 
  it takes a lot more than a few thousand armed men to commit a revolution . 
  there have been much larger rebellions in european history which have had little to no effect on the countries . 
  it 's funny , people used to believe that the sami have more siberian genes and finns have more european genes , but judging by this at least we seem to be the more siberian ones . 
  well , one can never be certain ... ctulhu fhtagn !!, 
  oh yeah , i remember this one . 
  i do n't know , it could just be urban legend . 
  i mean , many abandoned buildings and places have satanic symbols painted on the walls and other ritualistic things and creepy art . 
  usually it 's just bored teenagers who are trying to be edgy . 
  yeah , bad idea . 
  it 's very illegal to enter these tunnels , and you get in big trouble if the police catches you . 
  and there are lots of sketchy people in the catacombs , like cult members , criminals , etc. 
  someone could kill you and no one would ever find out . 
  but the biggest problem is that you could very easily get lost and die , or get caught in a landslide and die , or fall into a hole and die . 
  however , some parts of the paris catacombs are open for tourists , and you can enter them legally and safely with a guide . 
  they 're pretty cool , they 're full of bones and hold the remains of more than six million people . 
  yes , there 's a special police force called e.r.i.c. 
  that patrols the catacombs . 
  holy shit , i think i just discovered a new phobia . 
  getting lost in there would be unimaginably horrifying . 
  imagine walking alone in the dark for days , with no way to tell where you 're going or how long you 've been there , knowing that you 'll die in there ... 
  i would much rather get lost in a forest or a desert or the sea . 
  somehow dying down there trapped in the dark tunnels sounds extra horrifying . 
  username checks out . 
  i like his name , `` paska '' is finnish for shit . 
  what a peculiar color , it looks almost artificial . 
  i did n't know lentils have flowers .
