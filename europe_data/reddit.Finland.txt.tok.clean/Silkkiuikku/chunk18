  it 's oddly symbolic that the last emperor was named after the first king of rome , romulus , and the arguably greatest emperor , augustus . 
  actually , it 's kaarle suuri . 
  the [ sein\u00e4joki city library ] ( http://www.viisykkonen.fi/sites/default/files/field/image/seinajoki-kirjasto.png ) is insane !, 
  there are [ cozy red holes in the walls ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get2/i0000xjrv2xru1l4/fit=1000x750/tu-120921-apila-kirjasto-046.jpg ) - a [ flower box room ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/tlindfors/18768980815/in/pool-382591@n22/ ) - a [ green amphitheater ] ( http://betoni.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sein\u00e4joen-kaupunginkirjasto-tuomas-uusheimo-kuva-2.jpg ) - and i do n't even [ know what this is ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/tlindfors/18146317794/in/pool-382591@n22/ ), 
  this library is pretty crazy . 
  here are more photos : [ - flower box room ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/tlindfors/18768980815/in/pool-382591@n22/ ) [ - a green amphitheater ] ( http://betoni.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sein\u00e4joen-kaupunginkirjasto-tuomas-uusheimo-kuva-2.jpg ) [ - and i do n't even know what this is ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/tlindfors/18146317794/in/pool-382591@n22/ ) and here 's the library [ from the outside ] ( http://www.viisykkonen.fi/sites/default/files/field/image/seinajoki-kirjasto.png ), 
  what a beautiful poem . 
  and husband to bears !, 
  yes , but many people interpreted it as an aggressive `` we will destroy you '' rather than `` you will destroy yourselves and then your workers will covert to communism and then our ideology will triumph '' . 
  ukraine stronk !, 
  yeah , it seems like a bit of a misunderstanding . 
  apparently by saying `` we will bury you '' khrushchev actually meant `` we will outlive you '' or `` we will take care of your funeral arrangements after you ruin yourself '' . 
  so it 's probable that he meant to say that the communist soviet union would still be doing great after the capitalist countries ' inevitable demise , but something was lost in translation . 
  which is exactly why they 're pissed off at russia occupying it and artists supporting said occupation . 
  they 're not banning people for performing in ukraine , they 're banning people for performing in russia occupied ukraine . 
  the artist is a persona non-grata , because she performed in occupied crimea . 
  all artists who have performed in occupied crimea are banned from entering ukraine . 
  yeah , is n't russia the one that 's undermining the integrity and non-political nature of the eurovision song contest , by choosing an artist who has been banned from entering ukraine . 
  oh , well that changes things . 
  funny , the finnish word for plant , * kasvi * , is derived from the finnish word for growing . 
  so the the finnish word for plant also means `` thing that grows '' . 
  the things is , the parents of the dead swedish girl may not want the photo of their deceased daughter plastered all over media . 
  t 's pssible that they wish grieve in privacy . 
  so if the media shows the photo of the girl , her parents may sue . 
  meanwhile the parents of the dead syrian children probably ca n't afford to sue any newspaper . 
  [ removed ], 
  i think we 've all become quite desensitized to this kind of stuff lately . 
  i know this sounds horrible , but when i read the news about the car incident , my first reaction was : `` only three people dead ? 
  then it was just a small attack '' . 
  when so few people die in a terrorist attack , i feel relieved . 
  i might have been shocked four years ago , but i do n't have the energy to get shocked by cars ramming into people anymore . 
  5 people died in the stockholm attack , 8 died on the london bridge and 12 people died in the berlin christmas market . 
  but all these just feel like `` small terrorist attacks '' since a whopping 87 died in the truck attack in nice . 
  the only exceptional thing about the one in charlottesville is that the perpetrator was n't isis . 
  same shit , different scumbags . 
  because it makes us feel like game of thrones characters ? 
  well , the crimea invasion happened in this century . 
   so a nation that 's bigger than some continents , would like to invade someone for ` more land ' ? 
  would n't be the first time . 
  honestly , i 'm more worried about russia hurting russians than russia hurting anyone else . 
  i 've met some very nice russians , and it sickens me that their country is lead by mob boss who has been known to have political opponents killed . 
  i ca n't imagine what that 's even like . 
  if i found out that the finnish government is assassinating dissidents , i would be fucking terrified . 
  dust . 
  i hate vacuuming . 
  i think we have the opposite situation than america . 
  in america they 're removing statues from the losing side of their civil war . 
  meanwhile , here people have become increasingly accepting of the losing side of our civil war . 
  in 1918 , there was a very brutal civil war in finland . 
  the country had newly become independent for russia , and there was a disagreement about what the form of governance should be . 
  the white guards fought for democracy , and the red guards fought for socialism . 
  the reds lost . 
  for years the families of red soldiers were n't even allowed to bring flowers to their graves . 
  meanwhile , great monuments were built for the whites . 
  the city of tampere is where the greatest battles of the civil war were fought . 
  in tampere cemetery there is [ a monument for the white guards ] ( http://www.tampere.fi/ekstrat/taidemuseo/patsaat/isokuva/valkvain.jpg ) . 
  it was unveiled in 1921 , only three years after the end of the civil war . 
  on the same day another monument to the whites , the [ statue of freedom ] ( https://hyllytonttu.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/wpid-img_20140808_123839.jpg ) was unveiled in a park in tampere . 
  the finnish people remained rather divided for years . 
  then the finnish government started making a conscious effort to mend the old wounds . 
  as a part of these efforts , several monuments were built for those who died fighting on the red side . 
  in 1941 [ a monument for the reds ] ( http://www.tampere.fi/ekstrat/taidemuseo/patsaat/isokuva/3801ik.jpg ) was unveiled in tampere cemetery . 
  on the pedestal it says : * `` for the workers who died for their cause '' * . 
  in all seriousness , it 's probably for the better that it did n't happen . 
  before the 1918 finnish civil war , the marjory of the members of the parliament were against monarchy . 
  the social democratic party of course opposed to it . 
  but after the 1918 civil war , almost all of the social democratic members of the parliament were either dead , in prison , or escaped to russia . 
  with the social democrats gone , the royalists were in the majority in the parliament , and monarchy was elected as the form of government . 
  so it 's probably good that prince frederick charles renounced the throne , because monarchy really was a rather unpopular decision . 
  well , all the other nordics seem to be doing fine with theirs . 
  the lana del rey song . 
  probably not , but i think that people are more vocal about it . 
  since the refugee crisis started , public discussion surrounding refugees and immigrants has been pretty crazy . 
  everyone 's just hurling insults at each other , and saying weird shit seems to have become more acceptable . 
  only if they attack us , which seems rather unlikely . 
  it would be a very expensive war , and the benefits would be minimal . 
  we have no valuable natural resources , like oil or gas . 
  and starting a war with an eu country would hurt russia 's trade and diplomatic relations . 
  of course , putin might do it anyways , either to send a message to other western countries , or to boost his popularity among russians . 
  but i think he 'd find some less expensive way to swing his dick . 
  i am kinda worried about all the cyber-warfare going on . 
  it 's a rather cheap and effective way to destabilize my country . 
  russia has been known to fund extremist organizations in other countries , in order to weaken them . 
  if i was an immoral imperialist megalomaniac in charge of russia , i would probably channel money to the neo-nazis , the antifa and the islamists in finland , and play them against each other . 
  let all these useful idiots do my dirty work for me . 
  it seems likely that the kreml is already supporting our local neo-nazis in some way . 
  most of the finnish neo-nazi newspapers and websites are full of putinist propaganda about how great old vladimir is . 
  norway would be nice . 
  access to the atlantic ocean , oil , higher mountains , nicer geopolitical position , and not too different from home . 
  after finland became independent the parliament decided that we should have a king , and elected the german [ prince frederick charles of hesse ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/c1/df/38c1dfca0b161029c9dedbff7b644027.jpg ) as king of finland . 
  [ this is the crown he would have worn ] ( https://babylon.naurunappula.com/screen/b0/88/b088a31147b76120/0/1258053.jpg ) . 
  his propers title would have been : charles i , king of finland and karelia , duke of \u00c5land , grand duke of lapland , lord of kaleva and the north . 
  however , to finland 's surprise , germany lost ww1 and finnish politicians realized that having a german-born king might harm the young country 's relations to the allied countries . 
  frederick charles renounced the throne on 14 december 1918 , saving the finns from the embarrassment of having to ask him to do so . 
  you have every right to speak your native language . 
  not really , no . 
  usa . 
  yeah . 
  neo-nazi protests have a tendency to turn into mass fights between the demonstrators and whichever group of anarchists is protesting against them . 
  it 's better if the police keeps the two groups apart .
