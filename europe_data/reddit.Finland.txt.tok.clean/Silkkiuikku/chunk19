  i do n't quite understand why you 're shocked . 
  some american neo-nazis threw a protest and engaged in violent behavior ? 
  that 's what neo-nazis do !, 
  there 's nothing new under the sun . 
  besides , it does n't really make sense to judge a country based on a small group of criminals . 
  judging the american people based on crazy neo-nazis would be like judging all frenchmen based on the insane jihadists . 
  and it 's not like we do n't have our fair share of neo-nazis in our countries . 
   i feel working class folks are more likely to know people who 'd engage in that sort of behaviour is n't catcalling usually done by strangers , though ? 
  what does `` class '' have to do with anything ? 
  how on earth could a person 's money situation affect how much she gets catcalled ? 
  i do n't think so , no . 
  i 've only been blatantly catcalled once , by a foreign-looking young man who spoke english . 
  he grabbed his junk and called me `` sexy baby '' , it was quite revolting . 
  the question in the title was : `` how much your country values traditional gender roles ? '', 
  and my answer is : `` not much , they 're pretty stupid . '', 
  it 's silly and old-fashioned to expect people to act a certain way because of their gender . 
  i 've never seen such a tourist . 
  i would be flattered if i ever did . 
  not much , they 're pretty stupid . 
  conquering is bloody difficult . 
  even small third world countries like vietnam , afghanistan and iraq are n't easy . 
  and europe is ... not a small third world country . 
  if a woman is wearing a lot of very noticeable makeup , lots of jewelry , and very high heels , and has hair like melania trump , she 's probably russian . 
  i do n't know why , i just have n't ever become acquainted with one . 
  ignorant is n't really an excuse , though . 
  they * should * know better . 
  finland is n't very dense . 
  and zombies ca n't bite through winter clothes . 
  we should be fine . 
  the only really important thing is that you obey the laws of the country you live in . 
  everything else is negotiable . 
  even before he was elected , it was glaringly obvious that trump was atrociously incompetent for the job . 
  i wished he would prove us all wrong once he became president , but alas , he did n't . 
  how anyone could think that he has `` done a good job '' is beyond me . 
  the guardian ? 
  what has america even done for us ? 
  nations rarely help other countries in need out of good will , and superpowers are no exception . 
  like russia and china , the u.s. helps other countries when it 's advantageous for them . 
  how could kim jong-il ever hope to destroy the united states ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  i am not saying that he is n't a lunatic , but a war against america would be suicide , especially since he has pissed off all of his allies . 
  kim jong-il attacking south korea : he could destroy soul in a matter of minutes . 
  possession and selling marijuana is illegal here , so no i would n't call it a `` normal thing '' . 
  many people think that it should be legalized , though , as it 's no more harmful than tobacco or alcohol . 
  and i have absolutely no idea what you mean by saying that hemp would be better than wood products . 
  that depends who you 're asking . 
  i personally think that my country is a better place to live in many ways . 
  in the united states you have to pay for education , health care is extremely expensive , the death sentence is still in use in many states , it 's legal for parents to hit their children , prison sentences are atrociously long and prison conditions are dreadful etc. 
  etc. . . 6 . 
  the universe is wast and full of galaxies , which are full of solar systems , which are full of planets . 
  many of those planets have earth-like conditions . 
  it seems highly unlikely to me that life would n't have developed on any of them . 
  there is no reason to believe that any extra-terrestrial creatures have ever visited earth , though . 
  top 10 : 1 .

  it 's lead by a dictator called lukashenko , the human rights situation is shit , public gatherings are banned , the death sentence is still in use ... 
  the tradition clothing is beautiful , though . 
  iirc it 's haram for muslim women to marry non-muslim men , but muslim men are allowed to marry christian or jewish women . 
  i guess it depends on the individual whether they choose to follow this rule or not . 
  i do n't know any percentages . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i feel sorry for the poor bastards , their country is fucked . 
  * = `` go ski into a cunt ! '', 
  i 'd say that the average romani is quite a bit darker than the average finn . 
  of course , there are exceptions , but if i showed you [ this photo ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/5326326/landscape16_9/1024/576/5bf891014f751f2fe60660329d248c2e/oc/putous-nayttelijat.jpg ) and [ this photo ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/tv-ja-leffat/amran2_tw.jpg ) , you could probably guess which group is romani based on complexion . 
  are you sure your grandmother 's parents were n't just trying to scare her into behaving ? 
  i know that in the past finnish parents would tell children : `` if you do n't behave , i 'll sell you to the gypsies ! '', 
  here it 's the same thing . 
  we also have eastern european romani who come here to beg . 
  it 's organized crime : some mafioso sends them to finland to beg , and takes most of the money . 
  it 's a form of human trafficking . 
  that 's why i never give money to beggars here . 
  i 've never seen a finnish romani begging . 
  it 's only the eastern european ones who do that . 
  the finnish ones either work , or receive social security , just like everyone else . 
  the foreign romani dress in a very different way , too : [ - eastern european romani ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/347892/landscape16_9/1024/576/f1c9149fe5fba6e2a97a882d79ec95af/ij/1375557.jpg ) [ - finnish romani ] ( https://kotiliesi.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/romani_janita_kokovkuva.jpg ), 
  probably because they have dark skin , hair and eyes . 
  and the romani word for themselves is * kaale * which means `` black '' . 
  many gypsies who speak the romani language use the romani word * kalo/kale/kaale * , which means `` black '' , to describe themselves . 
  the word for non-romani is * gadjo/gajo/kaaje * . 
  it can also refer to an ethnic romani who does not live within romani culture . 
  i wonder if the fact that we can easily tell apart the gypsies from everyone else helps ? 
  i mean , southern europeans probably ca n't tell gypsies apart from everyone else , unless they 're doing something bad , so they do n't notice all the normal ones . 
  while in finland most gypsies are noticeably darker than most people , and finnish gypsies also wear [ very distinctive clothing ] ( http://www.ljplus.ru/img4/k/o/kommari_2/romanit.jpg ) . 
  so i know for a fact that walk past a bunch of gypsies every day , and they all act like normal human beings . 
  maybe the croatian word for `` gypsy '' means something different than the english one . 
  it 's not the same in every language . 
  for example , the finnish word for `` gypsy '' is synonymous with the word `` romani '' , because they 're the only kind of gypsies around here .
