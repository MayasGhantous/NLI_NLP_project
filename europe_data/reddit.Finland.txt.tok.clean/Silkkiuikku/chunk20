  what 's the croatian word for gypsy ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  there are several groups of travellers which are referred to as `` gypsies '' in english , and the romani are probably the most famous one . 
  they 're definitely gypsies . 
  you 're not contributing to the conversation . 
  it varies from language to language , but the english word `` gypsy '' is a catch-all term for all european nomadic peoples . 
  the largest and most famous of these groups is the [ romani people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) or roma people , a traditionally nomadic people who migrated to europe from india in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  often the words `` gypsy '' and `` romani '' are used interchangeably . 
  in the past roma were travellers and mostly worked as tinkers , farriers and peddlers . 
  however , in modern society the need of these jobs has declined sharply . 
  not all romani are nomadic , and nowadays many live sedentary lives and are integrated to mainstream society . 
  for example in finland there are no traveling gypsies . 
  the romani culture is characterized by a strong sense of community , respect for one 's elders , and strict rules regarding ritualistic purity and taboos . 
  the history of the romani people resembles that of the jews . 
  in many countries vagrancy was a crime , and travellers were often persecuted and subjected to ethnic cleansings . 
  the nazis committed a genocide against the romani people , murdering dozens of thousands of them . 
  the modern situation of the roma is very complicated and varies from country to country . 
  in some countries they 're semi-integrated , live in houses , and have jobs . 
  in other countries , especially in eastern europe , the situation is more difficult . 
  many of the gypsies live in trailer parks or ghettoes , refuse to follow the law , do n't send their children to school , and live by organized crime like pick pocketing gangs . 
  on the other hand , many of the non-gypsies are very prejudiced and racist towards them and treat them badly . 
  in my opinion there is a big attitude on both sides . 
  of course , even in these countries many gypsies are normal , law-abiding citizens , but people only notices the pickpockets and muggers . 
  there are many other nomadic peoples who are commonly referred to as `` gypsies '' . 
  these include [ irish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) , [ scottish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_gypsy_and_traveller_groups ) and the [ yenish people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yenish_people ) . 
  many of these people are n't travellers anymore , though . 
  i do n't know enough about these people to tell about them . 
  here the old word is * mustalaiset * . 
  people use * romanit * in official situations , because it 's the politically correct word and some people consider * mustalaiset * to be offensive . 
  * mustalaiset * is n't really a bad word though , most people do n't use it in a mean way . 
  the gypsies call themselves * kaale * , but i do n't think outsiders are supposed to use that word . 
  then there 's * manne * which is a mean slur . 
  that 's not quite true . 
  `` gypsies '' can also refer to any romani people , even if they 're not travellers anymore . 
  germany is a big and influential country , though . 
  i think it kinda sucks being a small and weak country . 
  big countries can do whatever they want , while the small ones have to try not to upset them . 
  it 's hilarious , like watching a train wreck !, 
   they are viscous the word you 're looking for is `` vicious '' . 
  * viscous * means `` a substance that has a thick , sticky consistency between solid and liquid '' . 
  yeah , if they want to save europe , they should get rid of their putinist president . 
  a bunch of racist , ignorant idiots . 
  we do n't have any . 
  socks and woolen sock if it 's cold . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's considered european , but i really like kalaallisut aka west greenlandic . 
  [ this is what it sounds like ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzhymmnr05e&amp;t=0m17s ) . 
  i 've posted this same thing in r/unsolvedmysteries : the [ lake bodom murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_bodom_murders ) . 
  it 's the most famous unsolved mystery in finland , and a crazy case . 
  there 's even a heavy metal band called * children of bodom * . 
  on the 5th of july 1960 four teenagers , two girls and two boys , went camping on the shore of lake bodom . 
  during the night someone attacked the teenagers . 
  three of them died from skull injury and stab wounds . 
  the fourth teenager , nils gustafsson was found alive , but gravely injured and semi-unconscious . 
  he had received a hard blow which had fractured his skull . 
  gustafsson claimed to have no recollection of the night . 
  _____________________________________ there are four main suspects : ** 1 . 
  pentti soininen , a criminal ** in the late 1960s pentti soininen , an inmate in kuopio prison serving time for multiple crimes , confessed to having committed the lake bodom murders . 
  at the time of the murders soininen had been 15 years old . 
  having run away from a reformatory , he had indeed been close to lake bodom during the night the murders . 
  the police interrogated soininen , but found his confession to be unreliable . 
  soininen was known to be a psychopath who could act in a very strange and unpredictable way , especially under the influence of alcohol and drugs . 
  in 1969 soininen committed suicide by hanging himself . 
  valdemar gyllstr\u00f6m , a man who hated campers ** valdemar gyllstr\u00f6m owned a kiosk near lake bodom . 
  gyllstr\u00f6m was notoriously hateful towards campers , and would often act aggressively . 
  there is a rumor that gyllstr\u00f6m confessed to his neighbor while drunk . 
  during the investigation gyllstr\u00f6m 's wife confirmed his alibi , saying that they had spent the whole night together . 
  however , before her death the wife said that her husband had threatened to kill her if she told the truth . 
  in 1969 gyllstr\u00f6m drowned in lake bodom , either accidentally or on purpose . 
  hans assmann , an ex-nazi ** ( yes , i know , it 's a funny name ) hans assmann was a german immigrant . 
  in his youth assmann had been a staunch nazi , and had started working as a guard in auschwitz concentration camp at the age of 19 . 
  on the day after the murders assmann was brought to helsinki hospital . 
  he was acting in a very strange way , and was aggressive and nervous . 
  he was very disheveled and had dirt under his fingernails and red stains on his clothes . 
  he lied about the reason for his disheveled appearance . 
  there 's an unfounded rumor that assman had been employed by the kgb after the war . 
  some conspiracy theorists claim that the government hushed up assmann 's crimes because they feared soviet retaliation . 
  assmann has also been linked to several other famous finnish murder cases . 
  he somewhat enjoyed his bad reputation and would often fan the flames by saying creepy things . 
  assmann did , however , have a near-perfect alibi : he had spent the night with his mistress in the same apartment with her sister and brother-in-law . 
  according to them , it would have been impossible for assmann to leave the house during the night without someone noticing . 
  the red stains on assmanns clothing were red paint , and his strange behavior was caused by drunkness . 
  nils gustafsson , the fourth teenager . 
  ** it 's possible that gustafsson killed his friends and either purposefully injured himself , or was hurt by his struggling victims . 
  in 2004 , the police announced that they had discovered new evidence thanks to modern dna - technology . 
  gustafsson was suddenly arrested on suspicion of having committed the lake bodom murders . 
  the result of the trial was `` not guilty '' . 
  i like to do that when i 'm get bored at the airport .

  there 's a finnish guy called [ johan b\u00e4ckman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b\u00e4ckman ) who lives in russia and works as a kremlin propaganda machine . 
  he 's an all around charming person : - he claims that russian immigrant children that are being taken care of by finnish child protection authorities are living in `` concentration camps '' , and accuses finland of a `` genocide of children '' . 
  he has not provided numbers for how many children are supposed to have been killed in this alleged `` genocide '' , and has not revealed any sources for his information .
