  - the finnish police suspects that b\u00e4ckman is guilty of persecution and slander against the journalist jessikka aro . 
  - he claims that malaysia airlines flight 17 shootdown was a united states provocation to justify a nato intervention in donbass conflict , and describes ukrainian government as `` the kiev junta '' . 
  - he has dismissed the soviet occupation of estonia as a `` nazi myth '' and said that * speaking or writing of soviet `` occupation '' should be criminalised as a form of racist propaganda . 
  * - he does not recognize estonia and latvia as states . 
  well , swedish is mandatory in finnish schools . 
  well , it would be great if all african countries became democratic like european countries , though it does n't seem to be very likely . 
  of course , it 's a huge continents with many different countries . 
  some countries , like botswana , are doing much better than , say , somalia . 
  i 've posted some of these before in another thread , but here are some : [ pyry ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/330208/landscape16_9/1024/576/98ed89233b0354c8744e8dd47e2ab598/wk/1322905.jpg ) : densely falling snow nuoska : adjective describing snow that has become soft and slightly moist because of warmer weather and that can be used to make snowballs or snowmen hanki : a layer of snow on the ground [ tykky ] ( http://www.vuodenluontokuva.fi/vlk/showthumb.aspx?fsr=0&amp;img=%2fvlk%2fuserfiles%2fvlk%2f2007%2fgalleria%2fmaisemat+manninen+jarmo+tykky%2ejpg&amp;maxsize=992 ) : thick hardened clumps of snow on tree branches [ avanto ] ( http://www.inarisaariselka.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/laanilan_kievari_avanto-850x478.jpg ) : a whole in the ice for swimming [ vihta/vasta ] ( http://akaanseutu.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/28vihtavestivaalit-2-mestariteos.jpg ) : a bundle of birch branches which you use to slap yourself in a sauna because it 's relaxing [ kiuas ] ( https://liinanblogi.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/saunan-lc3a4mmitys-kiuas.png ) : the sauna heater [ puukko ] ( https://www.iisakkijarvenpaa.fi/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/fe08d497c0aad9f11813855608fc3fc2/k/v/kvan_hevospa_a_p.jpg ) : a type of work knife . 
  the finnish word for stabbing , `` puukottaa '' is derived from the word puukko, 
  are n't all of them from antiquity ? 
  we 've been celebrating christmas and easter ever since we became christian in the 1100s and 1200s . 
  and then there are pagan celebrations like midsummer which are even older . 
  learn the language and ** obey the laws ** . 
  it 's a good country for children : free education , free lunch in primary , secondary and high schools , free pre-natal check ups at clinics and free [ maternity packages ] ( http://www.kela.fi/documents/10180/268701/2017_kaikki_tuotteet.jpg/5c3f077e-48ad-424d-9cb0-a4ec54889029?t=1488871701406 ) for all mothers-to-be . 
  okay , apparently there 's been three school shootings in finland . 
  there 's been two , i think . 
  we did once . 
  it 's so creepy how normal those identitarians look . 
  reminds me of a terry pratchett quote : * `` do n't trust the cannibal just ' cos he 's usin ' a knife and fork ! '' *, 
  ** if helsinki is beautiful ** , leevi and the leavings - my greetings to those who are under the bridges to jarkka and kalle nieminen they went out to the world glowing with excitement the sky was the limit for the adventurers now both have been drinking for years they 've shed their skins and become men of the beaches or maybe they 've already rotted beneath the earth a little piece of heaven for the unfortunate - * refrain : * if helsinki is beautiful for a moment when the ground is white soon it will rain sleet again if helsinki is beautiful for a moment it is only a dream a vain fantasy - now i must roam the old neighborhoods alone and the plastic basket so strange to a hobo 's hand liisa from the butcher 's shop is no longer young * refrain * * refrain *, 
  i read about lidice in a history book once . 
  it 's a pretty fascinating story . 
  after the nazis massacred the inhabitants of lidice and destroyed the town , people all over the world named new towns after lidice so that the world would never forget . 
  there is a san jer\u00f3nimo-l\u00eddice in mexico city , barrio l\u00eddice in venezuela , l\u00eddice de capira in panama , neighborhood called lidice in crest hill , illinois and several towns in brazil . 
  i 'm not sure if it counts as a folk song , but i love [ veteraanin iltahuuto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtc2btxxzmq ) . 
  it 's a song that 's popular among the war veterans . 
  in the video it 's being sung at the funeral of president mauno koivisto , a veteran of the continuation war . 
  some of my favorites : anna-mari k\u00e4h\u00e4r\u00e4 : * [ kuka nukkuu tuutussasi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e36cjx75dto ) ( a happy crazy song with crazy dance movements ) candomino : * [ sinisi\u00e4 punasia ruusunkukkia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmstkj5qlg8 ) ( a bittersweet song about love ) tapio kuula : * [ tuuti tummaistani ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzhledpsinu ) ( a lullaby for a dying child . 
  the mother is telling her baby that the ) jonas bleckman : * [ himlens polska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdntvhah58q ) ( the most melancholic song i know . 
  could make a stone weep . ), 
  merja soria : * [ aamulla varhain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejidikidqcc ) ( a song about rejection ) * [ kyl\u00e4 vuotti uutta kuuta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v47otsnnxis ) ( a weird but upbeat song ) * [ ievan polkka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) ( this song is an internet sensation ! ), 
  i do n't think many men shave their body hair , which is good . 
  and many only shave during the few warmer months of the year . 
  what 's the point of shaving when you have to wear winter clothes all the time ? 
  probably iceland . 
  why the down votes ? 
  he 's right !, 
  i second this , german bread is great . 
  i laughed out loud reading this . 
  or the east , or the islands , or even central finland . 
  that 's how it is for small countries . 
  when a big country takes ten percent of your land , you pay reparations to them and celebrate the fact that they did n't take the whole country . 
  actually , if people would have stayed they would likely have been killed in some purge . 
  stalin was very paranoid . 
  after the 1918 civil war many finnish communists escaped to the soviet union , and 25 000 -- 30 000 of them were killed in stalin 's ` purges in the 1920s and 1930s . 
  stalin considered them unreliable traitors , and he also suspected that they were spies . 
  it 's very likely that the same would have happened to any finns who would have stayed in karelia . 
  a geographic entity , from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains , from the arctic ocean to the mediterranean . 
  that manga is awesome . 
  a dessert . 
  i mean , they 're full of sugar and butter !, 
  i ca n't imagine eating something so sweet fro breakfast . 
  our old wooden churches !, 
  they come in all possible shapes and styles and show great craftsmanship . 
  they 're also pretty damn beautiful .

  zombie apocalypse is easy . 
  just wear winter clothes and a ski mask at all times . 
  human teeth ca n't bite through thick fabric . 
  the finnish vocabulary is quite wide . 
  here 's a demonstration : * suksi vittuun perkeleen kuisp\u00e4\u00e4mulkku !, 
  * translation : go ski into a cunt , you piss-headed penis of the devil !, 
  you dick hair that 's been fucked by the frost !, 
  you twisted ash cock !, 
  go sniff at a long shit , you human-arse of hell , even your face looks like an elephant 's cunt !, 
  go where the pepper grows , you dick nose !, 
  pull a cunt over your head , you narcissistic pig !, 
  you cock vomit of satan !, 
  surstr\u00d6mming !!!!!!, 
  burn it with fire !!!!!, 
  - * kansallinen kokoomus * ( national coalition party ) : a right wing party which is economically liberalist , they 're kind of like the american democratic party . 
  their stereotypical supporters are greedy , rich snobs . 
  - * ruotsalainen kansanpuolue * ( swedish people 's party ) : the party supports the rights of the swedish speaking minority . 
  they 're rather liberalist . 
  their stereotypical supporters are rich greedy , rich snobs who speak swedish . 
  - * perussuomalaiset * ( finns party ) : a populist party with conservative values , they dislike migrants and are very nationalistic .

  their stereotypical supporters are crazy religious fanatics who hate all fun things . 
  - * keskusta * ( centre party ) : a liberalist party which supports the rights of people living in the countryside . 
  their stereotypical supporters are stupid hillbillies . 
  - * vihre\u00e4 liitto * ( green league ) : their main goal is to protect the environment . 
  they 're not really left or right wing , but many of their values are very leftist as they support multiculturalism and tolerance . 
  their stereotypical supporters are naive , privileged hippies . 
  - * sosialidemokraattinen puolue * ( social democratic party ) : socially and economically left wing .

  - * vasemmistoliitto * ( left alliance ) : the same as the social democrats , but more left wing . 
  their stereotypical supporters are naive , privileged snobs who believe that communism was awesome . 
  polarisation . 
  there seem to be no moderate opinions , only extreme ones . 
  it 's either this : * `` we should take in all asylum seekers no matter where they come from , questioning refugees ' motives is racism !, 
  '' * or this insanity : * `` all refugees are fucking brown monkey rapists working for isis !, 
  but if there are enough people who pay taxes , then everyone can enjoy the benefits . 
  for example , no one in finland has to pay for education . 
  oh , i forgot it . 
  it 's a very nice country !, 
  that 's just how society works . 
  if you want to live in a country , you have to agree to obey the rules of the society . 
  paying your taxes is a part of this .
