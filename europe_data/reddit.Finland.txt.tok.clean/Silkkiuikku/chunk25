  the finnish actor [ ville haapasalo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ville_haapasalo ) is more widely recognized in russia than in finland . 
  in 2013 * forbes * magazine estimated that his face was the third most valuable face in russia . 
  they look cool . 
  it 's kinda like how many people like to wear t-shrits with french or latin phases they do n't understand , it 's just decoration . 
  no , definitely not . 
  - * sy\u00f6 rautaa ja paskantaa kettinki\u00e4 * - `` he eats iron and shits chain '' ( he is a tough guy ), 
  yeah , many foreigners also seem to have difficulty with tuli , tulli and tuuli . 
   my thoughts always go to those poor foreigners living in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 eheh . 
  they pronounce it as `` juuvaskuula '' . 
  the [ astuvansalmi rock paintings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astuvansalmi_rock_paintings ) are pretty cool . 
  the rock where the paintings are located looks like a human head . 
  the oldest paintings were made about 3000 -- 2500 bc . 
  they contain elks , hand prints , boats , humans and a woman with a spear who is thought to be a goddess . 
  - [ the lev\u00e4nluhta burial site ] ( https://www.luomus.fi/en/levanluhta-iron-age-water-burial-site-100-humans ) is pretty metal : it 's literally a blood-red spring which spits human bones . 
  in 1674 the reverend of isonkyr\u00f6-village wrote that humans bones have risen up from the lev\u00e4nluhta spring `` throughout the ages '' . 
  pieces of jewellery , wooden stakes , a bronze kettle -- and the skeletal remains of ca . 
  100 individual humans have been discovered in the spring . 
  it is not known whether it was a cemetery , or a place of human sacrifice . 
  the red color of the water is caused by high iron levels . 
  - then there 's the [ mummy of vicar nicolaus rungius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolaus_rungius ) . 
  according to legend , rungius said during his life : `` if my words are not true , my body will decompose , but if they are true , it will never decompose . '', 
  during the early 18th rungius ' body was found under the church floor , and it was discovered that it had been been mummified instead of decomposing . 
  the vicar 's body is still in the keminmaa old church underneath the floor between the altar and the sacristry , protected by glass . 
  one of mummy 's hands is missing . 
  some say that a german soldier took it as a souvenir during the war , while others claim that a drunk teenagers broke into the church and danced with the mummy until the hand came off . 
  the twenty years before finland became independent in 1917 . 
  it 's a pretty fascinating era . 
  the national awakening , passive resistance against russia , golden era in art , rise of socialism and worker 's unions ... 
  probably the long vowels and the diphthongs i.e. 
  combinations of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable . 
  examples of dffifuclt words : * hyv\u00e4\u00e4 y\u00f6t\u00e4 * ( good night ) or * hyv\u00e4\u00e4 ty\u00f6p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 * ( have a nice day at work ) . 
  or the compound word with the most vowels : * riiuuy\u00f6aie * ( wooing night intention ) . 
  i do n't think that 's so weird , actually . 
  most people have fond memories of their childhood , especially when they 're old . 
  they remember playing and having fun , and they did n't notice whatever fucked up shit was going on at the time . 
  i know many old people who have very fond memories of the time between 1939 and 1944 . 
  some of them lost family members in the war , and there were bombings , and a food shortage , but they remember playing and having fun . 
  `` i seen them do it , man , they fucking drown them in that shit . '', 
  in the 18th century people were very suspicious towards potatoes , so priests would preach about the merits of the potato in church . 
  well , in many countries there have been efforts to integrate the roma ( gypsies ) for the last decades . 
  the roma traditionally had a nomadic lifestyle and lived outside of society , which does n't really work nowadays . 
  some countries have been more successful at integrating them than others . 
  in finland only mentally ill and developmentally retarded people were subjected to the eugenics program . 
  people were n't sterilized for ethnic reasons . 
  you do realize that we did n't have many black people , or racial segregation , or jim crow laws , or any of that stuff in europe , right ? 
  i think that the most accurate comparison would probably be the basques . 
  they 've also been living side by side with other peoples for a very long time , and live normal modern lives , but still have their own language and traditions . 
  also , both basques and sami look the same as other people in the region . 
  they look like us , and they 're pretty much the same , except that they have their own languages . 
  and they have cool folk costumes , but they get super offended if someone else wears them for some reason . 
  and they are n't any poorer on average than other native finns , and i do n't think they drink any more than finns do . 
  there are n't really any stereotypes about them , except that many of them heard reindeer , and that they 're always offended about some weird thing . 
  they 're a really tiny minority though , we have way more somalis and iraqis in finland . 
  i do n't think it is a similar situation , really . 
  at least in finland , the government oppressed them in the past by not providing them education in their own language , and by not supporting their culture and traditions . 
  while this is obviously horrible and wrong , it 's quite different from the situation with ireland and great britain . 
  there are also some sayings like * ei pennin hyrr\u00e4\u00e4 * ( `` not even a penny '' ) . 
  pretty common , yeah . 
  the restaurants usually serve all kids of vegetarian dishes , but also meat stuff like chicken tikka masala . 
  and naan-bread and papadums for starter , and lassi for drink . 
  amount of immigrants . 
  ukraine is an independent country . 
  they have the right to join nato if they want to , it 's none of russia 's business . 
  i do n't know ? 
  all i said was that being nice and supporting a shitty ideology are n't mutually exclusive . 
   there 's not as much open and isolated areas in europe i see that you 've never been to finland . 
  russia invaded a part of ukraine . 
  is that not also `` meddling in internal affairs '' ? 
  maybe it 's because there is a stereotype that people in helsinki are pampered rich kids ? 
  great football players !, 
  a person can be very nice to be around , and still support a shitty ideology . 
  i 'm sure that there are many nice saudis , who still support death sentence for apostasy . 
  a person can be very nice to be around , and still support a shitty ideology . 
  i 'm sure that there are many nice saudis , who still support death sentence for apostasy . 
   also the us officials who participated in the so called ukrainian revolution and ukraine - russia conflict in 2014 and later why should n't they have ? 
  ukraine is an independent country . 
  if they have the right to ask other countries for military support . 
  and other countries have the right to support them . 
  some probably do , because some people will hate anything . 
  the wast , wast majority of people do n't hate america . 
  and in fact , many people greatly admire it . 
  most people like it , at least a little bit . 
  how could we not ? 
  we spend our lives watching your movies and tv series , listening to your music and reading your books . 
  when it come to your government , though ... well trump is widely considered to be a lying , incompetent fraud . 
  and i guess we 're a bit shocked and pissed off that americans would give so much power to an idiot like that . 
  because like it or not , the president of the united states has lots of power . 
  who you choose as your president impact all of us . 
  and you chose trump of all people !, 
  of course , some people like him . 
  i 've heard people praise him for being `` tough on immigration '' and `` a man of the people '' . 
  these opinions are in the minority , though . 
  how small it is in terms of population . 
  with only 5,4 million people , this country is quite empty . 
  many european cities have twice that many people living in them . 
  wedding cake , [ pulla ] ( https://www.arla.fi/globalassets/arla-fi-new-content/reseptit/kaikki-teemat/pulla.jpg?preset=full-desktop ) and lots of coffee . 
  i do n't think it 's common , but i googled this and found some newspaper articles about new hotels without room 13 . 
  i think they do it to appease american visitors . 
  i know the feeling . 
  oh yeah , i forgot about magneettimedia .
