  is n't that one hard core antisemitic , while mv is vaguely pro-israel ? 
  it 's painted on the wall of an abandoned factory building . 
  there are several run down factory buildings there , and people paint all kinds of graffiti . 
  the most popular building is the match factory ( * tulitikkutehdas * ) . 
  not at all . 
  they only appear at some official ceremonies . 
  most people know the name of the current one , though . 
  i do n't see why these things would change my view on that particular issue . 
  everywhere . 
  we have a shit-ton of lakes . 
  exactly . 
  wishing that someone were dead is cruel , but not illegal . 
  but suggesting that someone should be killed is indeed incitement to a crime . 
  there is a neo-nazi putinbot `` newspaper '' called mv-lehti , which is pretty insane . 
  they do n't even pretend to be reliable , they publish outright lies every day . 
  the time period between 1899-1917 would be pretty interesting at least . 
  the golden age of finnish art , large passive resistance movements against forced russification , the finnish independence in 1917 ... 
  i definitely would n't want to experience the 1918 civil war or the following food shortage and spanish flu pandemic , though . 
  these examples are ** not ** criminal hate speech : - * `` circumcision is a barbaric practice that should be illegal . 
  '' * * `` why do immigrants commit such a large percentage of sex crimes ? 
  '' * * `` why do we let in all these economic migrants ? 
  '' * * `` some cultures are just fucked up . 
  '' * * `` the nazis were right !, 
  '' * * `` i wish they would all just drown in the mediterranean . 
  '' * - some of these statements are obviously stupid , cruel , racist and islamophobic , but none of them are criminal in and themselves . 
  in finland hate speech is n't illegal , unless it contains criminal speech like defamation , a criminal threat or * incitement against a group * . 
  - ** examples : ** defamation : * `` the leaders of the islamic society of finland are a bunch of terrorists !, 
  '' * criminal threat : * `` i swear , if i see another raghead on my street , i 'm going to beat him up !, 
  '' * incitement against a group : * `` we should fucking burn down every refugee center in this country !, 
  i managed to guess the correct answers , so probably yes . 
  nirvana , the animals , the rolling stones , simon & garfunkel , the white stripes, 
  finnish houses usually are n't painted in crazy colors , but the most colorful places are probably [ the old part of porvoo ] ( https://maailmanaarella.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/porvoo_2016-121.jpg ) and the [ pispala district in tampere ] ( http://jaakkostenhall.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11174428_829079627162858_642760110451484381_o.jpg ) . 
  i love the [ savonian dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cn7gzsiocw&amp;t=0m11s ) . 
  so cute and chill , but also kinda smug . 
  yeah , i agree that it would be the best solution . 
  that being said , it 's not a perfect solution . 
  military training is quite expensive , and it does n't really make sense to train the whole population . 
  in a war , someone needs to stay at home and keep society running . 
  traditionally that has been the women 's job , because women are less physically capable on average , and some of them are also pregnant or nursing . 
  it 's not really cost-effective to train everyone since not everyone would actually be fighting in a war . 
  i posted this in the other thread , but here you go : * lenn\u00e4 , lenn\u00e4 , lepp\u00e4kerttu ison kiven juureen * ( `` fly , fly ladybug , to the foot of the big stone '' ) * siell\u00e4 is\u00e4s \u00e4itis keitt\u00e4\u00e4 sulle hyv\u00e4\u00e4 puuroo !, 
  * ( there your parents will cook you good porridge ! ), 
  when a ladybug lands on your hand you can make a wish while it walks to the tip of you finger , before it flies away . 
  and you have to sing this song . 
  yes , but they do n't have to . 
  that 's unfair for men . 
  we do it too , we call it * kahvitauko * ( coffee break ) . 
  i think it is nowadays . 
  the only real flaw i can think of is that men have mandatory military training , while women do n't . 
  but there is no easy solution to this . 
  i think there are two . 
  one is the national epic * kalevala * which is a collection of finnish oral folklore and mythology . 
  the other is the novel * seven brothers * by aleksis kivi , which was published in 1870 , and was the first novel ever written in finnish . 
  it kinda does , though . 
  in my opinion all people who worked for gestapo , stasi or kgb are guilty of being part of a criminal organization . 
  it also means that he worked for an evil organization which committed many heinous crimes . 
   ex kgb that 's a good thing ? 
  i think we can all agree that the [ singing revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution ) was pretty damn impressive . 
  is n't that a religious thing ? 
  iirc dogs are considered filthy in islam . 
  we 're the fifth happiest country in the world ? 
  what the fukcing fuck is this ? 
  i think that they should learn the language and integrate just like other immigrants . 
  i do n't think we need that in finland . 
  [ the moomin ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c4/4d/80/c44d80dd5feda0f91967e048b9dd2166.jpg ), 
  almost 20 % of finnish adults are lactose intolerant . 
  you forgot [ finlandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yv0rghhgn4 ) !, 
  easily the most beautiful one . 
  translation : `` ura-a-a-a ! '', 
  are you kidding ? 
  i linked this in another thread , but there is a very old and inappropriate song about the soviet union called [ s\u00f6rnai gusha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrjvrt2f-s ) . 
  - translation : - ( in fake russian ) * s\u00f6rnai gusha nietu molotova , * * s\u00f6rnai gusha herba moskova , * * njet , njet bonimai votvot risubuska , * * dara zeva votvot harashoo . 
  * - stalin is my father and khrushcheva is my mother they drank gin , and gave each other the eyes oh if only they had had vodka the thrust would have hit lower down - the shores of the volga smell of bird cherry , lilac and rose oh , beautiful golden kaditzusha your breasts smell of feelings - where the grain grows that 's where beautiful katjuska grew up katjuska has magnificent lungs the shores of the neva smell of shit - i 'm a poor kolkhoz woman i have no friends i have no cow and no sheep and no teeth in my mouth - the siberian tundra is wast sonya is shoveling snow there poor sonya had bloody bad luck the west wind brought more snow - i 'm a poor boy from petrozavodsk i have no friends the hammer and the sickle shine in the sky the smell of shit and the sound of the balalaika, 
  no one really knows . 
  you must understand that different peoples arrived to scandinavia a very long time ago , and there are no written sources on this . 
  linguistics and genealogy can only provide so much information . 
  exactly , in finland there is only one tiny municipality of 1 236 people where the sami are the majority . 
  well , they live in houses and most are law-abiding citizens with normal jobs , so i would say yes . 
  sauna , vodka , perkele !, 
  we had fire drills , and in high school we once had a `` move into locked spaces drill '' in case of school shootings . 
  well , there once was a finnish president called svinhufvud , literally pigs ' head . 
  i 'd like colder winters and warmer summers . 
  why is anyone 's skin color , gender , or facial hair relevant ? 
  you mean the oil war ? 
  i have some russian and swedish ancestry way back in my family tree . 
  no one views me in any special way , because how would they know ? 
  basically , there was a civil war because half of the country thought that enslaving their fellow man was all fine and dandy . 
  the losing side had a really good-looking flag , though . 
  some right-wing politicians say that the us immigration policy is good , and that immigrants who move to the us are more likely to integrate and adopt the culture and values . 
   but you did n't start the war ? 
  you just defended your land from a foreign power ? 
  but finland lost the war , and losers do n't get to write history . 
   is there any modern fear of a russian invasion given the crimea situation ? 
  not more than usual , i think . 
  both wars are part of ww2 . 
  this is the short explanation : in 1939 hitler and stalin made a pact and divided europe into spheres of influence . 
  nazi germany was supposed to invade poland , lithuania and romania , while the soviet union would get finland and the baltic countries . 
  soon stalin 's soviet union attacked finland in an attempt to annex the country . 
  this is how the winter war began . 
  the soviet union won the war , but they failed to conquer finland and only managed to annex 10 % of the land area .
