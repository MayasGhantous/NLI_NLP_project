  then in 1941 hitler began his operation barbarossa and attacked the soviet union . 
  finland allied with nazi-germany in an attempt to remain independent and to reconquer the territories which had been lost in the winter war . 
  meanwhile stalin wanted to annex finland , which he had failed to do in the winter war . 
  this war is what we call the continuation war . 
  finland eventually lost the war . 
  finland remained independent , but had to cede some additional territories to the soviet union , pay reparations , and admit being guilty of starting the war . 
  finland was on the losing side both in the winter war and the continuation war . 
  pretty much everyone agrees that if finland had n't fought in those wars , it would have been occupied by the soviets , which would have been much worse . 
   i assume besides plain invasion on your country . 
  but that 's the only good reason to fight a war . 
  i mean , maybe we could help defend some other country , like sweden or estonia , but otherwise , no . 
  in a popular finnish war novel one character expresses a similar sentiment : `` we 're not here to die , we 're here to kill . '', 
  i think it 's safe to assume that if another country were to invade finland , horrible things would happen . 
  the invading country would probably have to commit a small genocide in order to subjugate the finns . 
  they would have to kill everyone who would resist the invasion . 
  and of course , the invaders would have to get rid of democracy , freedom of speech , etc. 
  i think it 's safe to assume that many people whom i care about would end up dead or in prison . 
  from a purely pragmatic point of view , i think it would be better to fight and stay independent , than to let the country be conquered . 
  many people would die in a war , but even more would die in a total invasion . 
  so yes , i think i might agree to die in defense of democracy , freedom , and all the people i care about . 
  i do n't have one . 
  i do n't think i even know anyone who has an air conditioner . 
  people who do hard work for too little money . 
  is n't it the symbol imperial japan ? 
  so kinda like using the nazi swastika or the soviet hammer and sickle . 
   i know an american student who visited london and she told me she was shocked to find out that there were any skyscrapers/tall buildings i was surprised by that too when i visited london as a child . 
  i had never seen skyscrapers and did n't know that there were any in europe . 
  that looks really fucking awesome !, 
  or maybe some bored irishman wanted to fuck with some tourists and told them to go check out the viking reservations . 
  a quiet , slightly melancholic nerd who likes sit alone on his computer . 
  on the weekend his goes to a bar to get shitfaced . 
  in the summer he goes to live in a small , isolated cabin in the woods . 
  i do n't know , i never put ice in my drinks . 
  finland did n't hand over any finnish jews to nazi germany . 
  finland did however hand over eight austrian jewish refugees , as well as dozens of russian jewish prisoners of war . 
  no , but there are still many people alive who 's mother or father died in the finnish civil war . 
  this answer makes me really curious about what the removed comment was about ... 
  i do n't know if there are any . 
  there are n't many jews in finland even though there never was a holocaust here . 
  for some reason large groups of jews never moved here . 
  there are only two synagogues in finland , and neither of them is in my region . 
  i know of two famous finnish jewish persons , though . 
  it kinda is among some old people who 's parents or grandparents were involved . 
  silkkiuikku is the finnish name of the [ great crested grebe ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tdvn6wdinbw/unikssxnw_i/aaaaaaaaa08/gousqlvudi4/s1600/img_9865.jpg ) bird . 
  it 's a cool bird with a pretty name . 
  why ? 
  first of all , i never claimed to be an expert on anything , i simply answered the question * `` what do europeans actually think of americans and american culture ? '' * . 
  secondly , i do n't need to `` compare and contrast all of them and the various state prisons in vermont , nj and oregon '' in order to conclude that there 's something wrong with the us prison system . 
  anyone can see that !, 
  the recidivism rate is huge , the use of prolonged solitary confinement is somehow still legal , prisoners are n't allowed to vote , and they can be used as unpaid workers i.e. 
  slaves . 
  here it goes on for the whole year : `` why is there no snow ? '', 
  `` it 's snowing already ! '', 
  `` extremely cold weather ! '', 
  `` huge snowstorm ! '', 
  `` will the snow ever melt ? '', 
  `` the snow is already melting ! '', 
  `` very cold spring '' `` now it 's super hot ! '', 
  `` extremely warm weather ! '', 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somali_language, 
  you have to understand that a shit-ton of people came to europe , way more than the authorities were prepared to handle . 
  btw , the afghan could have been a refugee . 
  many afghans seek asylum because they 've pissed of their local taliban group or something . 
  the syrian were n't the only ones to seek asylum from europe , there were also lots of iraqis , afghanis and somalis .

  [ s\u00f6rnai gusha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrjvrt2f-s ) is a very old , very inappropriate song about the soviet union . 
  it 's a mocking version of the old russian folk song * katyusha * .

  i mean middle school , high school and university . 
  i know that you have public schools that are free , but they 're worse quality than private schools . 
  i think that all schools should be free and the same quality to give all children the same chances in life . 
  oh yes , definitely alcohol , a big bottle of alcohol .

  lots of american movies , tv shows and music are great . 
  there are some things about the culture that i do n't like though , like the lack of free education and public healthcare , and the prison system is shit . 
  here the hpv vaccination is becoming increasingly common , many girls and women get vaccinated to avoid cancer of the cervix . 
  i was vaccinated by the school nurse in high school . 
  and herpes is common and hard to prevent , but also somewhat harmless .
