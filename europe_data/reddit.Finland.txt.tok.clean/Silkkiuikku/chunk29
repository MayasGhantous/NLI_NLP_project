  i 'm glad that things seem to be improving . 
  a bunch of idiots who like to [ break windows ] ( https://sarastuslehti.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/anarkia-3.jpg ) and beat police horses . 
  they all have a massive victim complex and think that they 're oppressed by finnish society . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  trump is an unpredictable and incompetent man who wields way too much power .

  i 've never heard of any sex tourists visiting my country . 
  finns who buy sex in developing countries , like thailand , are generally looked down upon because many of the prostitutes there are underage and/or victims of human trafficking . 
  admire : lots of really nice people hate : the invasion of ukraine, 
  yeah , that 's stupid . 
  i 'm just saying that i agree with u/eishockey that iran is a tragedy . 
  i think that [ the human rights situation in iran ] ( https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/iran ) is a great tragedy . 
  from the amnesty international report : `` under iranian law , many crimes are punishable by death , including some that do not involve violence , such as `` insulting the prophet , '' apostasy , same-sex relations , adultery , and drug-related offenses . '', 
  `` iranian law allows capital punishment for persons who have reached the official age of puberty : nine for girls , 15 for boys . '', 
  `` same-sex conduct between men in iran is punishable by flogging or the death penalty . 
  same-sex conduct between women is punishable by flogging . '', 
  `` iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives , including personal status , matters related to marriage , divorce , inheritance , and child custody . '', 
  how is that objectifying women though ? 
  i do n't think that saying `` look , iranian women used to be able to wear miniskirts without being arrested ! '', 
  is objectifying at all . 
  good food , beautiful rugs , great poetry , but the human rights situation is shitty . 
  my knowledge on iran is pretty much based on one single comic book that i read as a kid , so i do n't know much . 
   hema ( longsword ) for a moment i thought you meant the [ dutch store chain hema ] ( https://www.hemashop.com ) . 
  there are flag poles in front of all kinds of official buildings , but also private homes . 
  on special days and holidays everyone flies their flags . 
  to me it symbolizes the nature . 
  blue as the lakes and the sky , white as the snow and the clouds . 
  no , the american film is in english and takes place in america . 
  it 's confusing as fuck to me since it does n't exist in finnish . 
  the finnish name of finland , * suomi * is originally the name of one region in the south . 
  now the region is called * varsinaissuomi * aka finland proper . 
  apparently new york . 
  makes sense since i watch so many movies and tv shows that take place there . 
  i think it 's good . 
  my only complaint is that they did n't teach much about the [ russian occupation in 1714-17 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_during_the_great_northern_war#russian_occupation_of_finland ) , event though it 's pretty fascinating ( and brutal ) . 
  it was only briefly mentioned , and the teacher did n't say that thousands of civilians were genocided and some 5 % percent of the population was captured and sold into slavery . 
  it 's one of the few truly interesting events in finnish history before the 19th century . 
  the lord of the rings movies , the long versions . 
  no , but i 've seen an american movie based on the same experiment , the wave . 
  yeah . 
  the reds were despised for decades , but today it 's easy to feel sympathy for them . 
  meanwhile supporting slavery has only become less acceptable . 
  i have many older relatives who do it too , they never shower . 
  alaska seems nice . 
  i have no idea if it 's a red or blue state . 
  btw , i think it 's funny how americans call republicans `` red '' , because i associate the word `` red '' with socialists . 
  it is tall . 
  not unusually tall , but tall . 
  i do n't know , but warm water could probably make your skin dry . 
  [ burbot soup ] ( https://anna.fi/ruoka/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/s/f/ruokaohje/978703-madekeitto-630x529.jpg ) , it 's the best . 
  i also like [ tappaiskeitto ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/69/5c/36/695c36dfb2f542052d69306bb188a4e2.jpg ) which is a weird traditional food made of liver and kidneys and other organs . 
  the name means `` killing soup '' as it was usually eaten after an animal had been slaughtered , because the organs would spoil quickly and you had to eat them on the same day . 
  yeah , the original purpose of saunas is for washing . 
  of course , in the past normal people did n't have showers and could n't afford to spend the whole day heating up water . 
  the sauna was warm and it was an easy way to heat up water , so people would wash in there . 
  in finland there is a commemoration day of fallen soldiers which is a membrance day for all finnish soldiers . 
  that includes both sides of the finnish civil war , the white guards who won , and the communist red guards who lost . 
  originally it was a victory day for the white guards , but then they changed it . 
  in tampere there is a cemetery where a big battle was fought during the civil war . 
  they have two monuments there . 
  [ the monument for the white guards ] ( http://www.tampere.fi/ekstrat/taidemuseo/patsaat/isokuva/valkvain.jpg ) was placed there in 1920 . 
  on the pedestal it says `` you gave your life for the freedom of your country and your tribe '' . 
  the [ monument for the reds ] ( http://www.tampere.fi/ekstrat/taidemuseo/patsaat/hietaiso.htm ) was placed in the cemetery in 1941 . 
  on the pedestal it says : `` for the memory of the workers who fell for their cause '' i find it interesting that in the us you remove statues from the losing side of the civil war . 
  in finland we 've given them statues and monuments . 
  i guess it 's easier to accept people who fought for communism than people who fought for the right to keep slaves . 
  we have a commemoration day of fallen soldiers on the third sunday in may . 
  it 's the remembrance day observed for all those who died in wars or other battles which concerned finland or finns , and those who died on peacekeeping missions . 
  it includes those who died during battles and those who died afterwards in prisoner of war camps or were executed . 
  there 's also national veterans ' day on 27 april , which is a remembrance day for all the war veterans in finland . 
  the war of lapland and the second world war ended in finland on 27 april 1945 , when the last german troops had retreated to norway ( which was at the time still under german occupation - ) across the border in the municipality of enonteki\u00f6 . 
  even if the day reminds a victory day , it is not celebrated as such . 
  among the events there are services in the evangelical lutheran churches , honorary guards on the war hero tombs , deposing wreath and the collecting money for the charity of the last war veterans ' needs . 
  are you absolutely sure that this is the right thread ? 
  i sometimes get called tall and i 'm a 180 cm woman . 
  showering twice every day is * way * too often . 
  that 's bad for your skin . 
   how does washing work in a sauna ? 
  traditionally you do n't have a shower in the sauna , so you take water into [ pails like this ] ( https://www.k-rauta.fi/rautakauppa-tuotekuvat//thumb/5/500/500801/500801691_1.jpg ) . 
  then you use a [ dipper like this ] ( https://www.ltt24h.fi/image_view.php?name=0/laajakuva_vesikauha_1l_6411760301643.jpg ) to pour water over yourself . 
  then you use soap and shampoo and then you rinse yourself with more water . 
  that 's how people washed themselves in the past when no one had showers . 
  every day or every two days depending on what i 've been doing . 
  except that on some days i go to sauna and then i use buckets with water to wash myself in the sauna . 
  nope . 
  dude , you ca n't just say that and not tell te whole story !, 
  i live pretty south . 
  it 's north from stockholm , though . 
  do you wan na name our country after the slow sheep people ? 
  i do n't think there are any . 
  if there 's a runaway dog somewhere , the animal control people will catch it . 
  and runaway cats probably do n't survive the winter , it 's too cold here . 
  what have you got against the suomalaiset tribe ? 
  i 'm surprised to hear that american lutherans are socially conservative . 
  in finland lutheranism is the biggest religion , and it 's considered more liberal than other religious groups like pentecostalism , jehovah witnesses , mormonism , islam etc. 
  there is a finnish called the christian democrats , which tends to attract very religious people . 
  their views are rather socially conservative . 
  they never get more than 5 % of the votes . 
  that 's true . 
  i 've just heard so many scary stories about police in other countries , especially america .
