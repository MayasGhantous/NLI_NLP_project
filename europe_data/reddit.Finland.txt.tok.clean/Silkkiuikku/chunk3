  no , this is the photo of the finnish participants to the nordic national costume seminar . 
  under the photo on the website it says : `` suomalaiset ryhm\u00e4kuvassa '' ( group photo of the finns ) .

  that 's so pretty !, 
  btw , there 's a finnish traditional dress with an identical scarf : http://www.taitoshop.fi/images/wwwkuvat/aivia/keski_suomi_3%20pukua.jpg, 
  yeah , i understand what you mean . 
  rt : s banned for a good reason though . 
  i remember watching a live screening of the parliamentary sitting where they were debating whether they should legalize gay marriage . 
  then hakkarainen said : `` we can make a law that sun shines at night , but it still would n't do so . '', 
  and another member of the parliament , oras tynkkynen said : `` we can ask ourselves what is the relevant difference between the sun and the marriage law . 
  the relevant difference is probably that us members of the parliament ca n't decide how the sun moves , but we can decide about the marriage law '' i wanted to applaud to my screen . 
  me too . 
  they 're used to hunt bears , so i think it 's safe to assume that they * are * indeed hardcore . 
  i think they were considered to be just another minority living in the russian empire . 
  what i do n't understand is how anyone could think that that populistic millionaire would help the disenfranchised . 
  well , i think there may be people who do n't want to do conscription , but who would want to fight when there is an actual war . 
  the training in conscription may feel unnecessary to some people in peace time , but it may come in handy if the world goes to shit and someone tries to invade . 
  of course , a war is very unlikely , but i do n't think that training people for it hurts . 
  no one likes war , war is hell . 
  but sometimes the other options are worse . 
  getting invaded tends to be kinda horrible too . 
  israel has mandatory military service for both men and women . 
  it seems to work fine for them . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  different feminist groups talk a lot about how unfair and sexist it is towards men , but nothing happens . 
  conscription is seen as a necessary evil , because we kinda do need an army . 
  people say that it would be stupid to train the whole population to be soldiers since at times of war we would still need lots of people for other tasks , which have traditionally been assigned to women . 
  i personally think that it should be made obligatory for both men and women . 
  our politicians are oddly conservative when it comes to this particular issue . 
  before 1995 women could n't volunteer to do the conscription . 
  in finnish it 's `` valkoven\u00e4j\u00e4 '' which translates to white russia . 
  in case you have n't noticed , putin already has launched a couple of wars of conquest . 
  i never believed it until i opened the newspaper while drinking my morning coffee . 
  i trusted americans to know better than this , to be better people than this . 
  yes , finland was part of the russian empire , and there was a pretty strict senatorship , so of course the school books had very positive description of russia . 
  well , given the time , it was in the writers best interests to praise russians . 
  there was a pretty strict censorship and the book would never have been published had the writer described russians as lazy . 
  hiv has nothing to do with the peace index , though . 
  what the fuck , i 'm pretty sure there is n't a secessionist movement in kainuu of all places . 
  we are ? 
  you 're right . 
  maybe you should post something positive , if you read russian news . 
  tomorrow breitbart will probably write an article about 200 muslims armed with guns interrupting the president by blowing up half of franze with a nuke and then dropping some napalm on it . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm pretty impressed by his calmness . 
  if i were a president i doubt i would be able to act so calm hearing a gunshot . 
  did he say : `` i hope it 's nothing serious ? 
  i do n't think so . '', 
  wait , where did it say that it was about black africans specifically ? 
  i thought that most of the people of african descent were north africans , who do n't really fit any traditional definition of `` black '' . 
  many of the africans living in germany are arabs or berbers . 
  that 's whataboutism . 
  just because some other countries do stupid shit does n't mean that we should too . 
  in finnish it 's `` ihminen on ihmiselle susi '' which is pretty much the same thing . 
  the original quote is in latin and it has been translated to english as : `` a man is a wolf to another man , '' or man is wolf to man . '', 
  yeah the bread has to purebread . 
  i feel kinda horrible for laughing out loud at the headless cartoonist running from a jihadist while holding a charlie hebdo magazine and shouting : `` you ca n't kill satire ! '', 
  so are you saying that boris nemtsov 's assassination was n't at least a bit suspicious ? 
  not really , it 's more like perseverance . 
  like when you keep trying no matter how hard it is . 
  btw , `` nuclear icebreaker '' sounds really metal . 
  it would make a hell of a band name . 
  well , anyone 's free to post positive things about russia if they know something . 
  but you must understand that especially for countries that border russia , the negative things are more urgent news . 
  it 's so weird to me that many people here seem to think that its russophobic to talk about a russian politician who was murdered . 
  i would argue that us ignoring the issue would be much worse . 
  if we did n't care about putin murdering his own people , then we would be russophobic . 
  well telling people not to talk about news that are embarrassing for the kreml is kinda bot-like behavior , do n't you think ? 
  i want to see an epic battle between his and [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/50/a5/d6/50a5d699e68cca7f16347ae924248816.jpg ) russian battleship commanded by the president putin who is holding the new russian super-weapon . 
  it 's an old man 's name . 
  actually `` brave '' , or `` brave-one '' would probably be a better translation . 
  and urho kekkonen was a president . 
  it was made in finland , though ( except for the nuclear reactor ) . 
  yeah , the vikings thought that most people went to a pretty boring and dark underworld after they died . 
  but if they died in battle they would get to a nice afterlife where they 'd drink mead and party with the gods forever . 
  kinda like a scandinavian version of the 72 virgins . 
  so you think we should hush up the assassination of a politician to avoid tarnishing the reputation of russia ? 
  seriously ? 
  people like to talk about how back in the day children were so much more well-behaved and never did stupid shit , but then there are these kinds of videos of old-timey kids jumping in front of a goddamn icebreaker . 
  in the article you linked it says that it 's finnish made , though . 
  same in english : `` valgatsh was made in finland , the reactor was added to it later in russia '', 
  voima = power / strenght urho = courage / bravery sisu = perseverance, 
  i never noticed the text . 
  the photo is from an article about the finnish icebreaker company arctic . 
  it does n't mention which icebreaker it is , but it looks similar to finnish icebreakers [ sisu ] ( http://www.laivabongari.fi/kuvat/2013/06/17_sisu.jpg ) and [ urho ] ( http://arctia.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/urho_4.jpg ) . 
  that 's also one attack to much , obviously . 
  the ideal situation would be one where no one is attacking anyone . 
  all over the news ? 
  it 's quite symbolical , really . 
  you ca n't play an orchestra piece alone . 
  all the instruments must play together in harmony to create the perfect sound . 
  one attack is one too much . 
  the caption above the photo says : `` great news !, 
  we have accepted an order to paint a portrait of the president of finland . 
  the order may have been accepted in a dream , though . 
  i may also have painted from the wrong photo . 
  but anyways . '', 
  um , what are you talking about ?
