  yeah , the american cops seem to be very bad at it . 
  for example , the finnish police for example has killed six people since the year 2000 . 
  if the us had the population of finland , then the american police would have killed approximately 100 people since the year 2000 . 
  so when adjusted to scale , the american police kills twenty times as many people as the finnish police . 
  to be fair , finnish cops do n't need to be fear criminals as much as american cops . 
  since the year 2000 only one finnish police officers has died on duty . 
  to be fair , a lot of brunettes are fake brunette 's , though . 
  yes i do , they 're well trained and rarely shoot anyone unless it 's absolutely necessary . 
   do i look stupid but also like a clone next to another person ? 
  i laughed way too hard at this . 
  not in the same way as the people in the movie * fargo * . 
  probably the [ battle of suomussalmi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_suomussalmi ) . 
  there were 11,500 finns fighting against 45,000 -- 55,000 soviets . 
  during the battle 750 finns died and 1,000 were wounded . 
  a whopping 21,000 -- 27,500 soviets ended up dead or missing . 
  additionally , 2,100 soviets were as taken prisoners , and 43 soviet tanks were captured . 
  the soviet red army was badly equipped for the unusually harsh winter , and many soviet soldiers froze to death . 
  the red army was also heavily mechanized , which lowered it 's mobility , as they were forced to stay on roads . 
  the finns had skis and sleds . 
  furthermore , the red army was still suffering from the aftermaths of stalin 's army purges in the 1930s , with many replacement officers being incompetent and inexperienced . 
  and of course , the finns were more motivated since they were defending their homes . 
  but minnesotans are super talkative , polite and friendly . 
  names that people spell in a foreign way in order to make them seem fancier : nico , luca , jessica , janica , jenny ,, 
  i do n't really give a fuck , to be honest . 
  it 's illegal here to hit anyone , adult or child . 
  and any form of child abuse is socially unacceptable here . 
  what ? 
  i 've been to split and i thought it was really beautiful . 
  there was even a roman palace !, 
  i 've not travelled outside of europe yet . 
  a group of big blonde nerds , who suffer from depression , speak very little and are constantly drunk . 
  i 've always found the second paragraph to be a bit creepy . 
  please no . 
  it 's obviously bullshit . 
  also people have started referring to the far-right group finland first as russia first , because they 're very chummy with putin and the kreml . 
  of course we have the international words like nazi , but we also have some domestic ones : - kukkahattut\u00e4ti - `` flower hat auntie '' , a naive elderly lady who is constantly shocked about everything - punikki - `` red person '' , a slur that was used during the finnish civil war to describe the socialists - lahtari - `` butcher '' , a slur that was used during the finnish civil war to describe those who fought the socialists - suvakki - `` tolerant person '' , a person who will tolerate absolutely anything from immigrants , and is eager to show everyone how tolerant he or she is - kettutytt\u00f6 - `` fox girl '' , a slur for environmentalists , originally it referred to activists who would vandalize fur farms, 
  in finland there was never serfdom . 
  i 'm an atheist , so it 's not important to me , but i would like to have a big wedding because i like big parties . 
  damn , i could hardly understand him , it took me way too long to realize that he was reading the julevangeliet . 
  my favorite is the [ savonian dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cn7gzsiocw&amp;t=61s ) . 
  it 's adorable !, 
  it sounds super chill and happy go lucky , but also a bit smug . 
  that 's pretty similar to our history : stone age - iron age - swedish crusades - middle ages - reformation - famine - war - russians - famine - national awakening, 
  yeah , i think that right now the most popular theory is that the ancestors of finns and the ancestors of the sami both arrived to finland . 
  then they adopted the same finno-ugric language . 
  some of these people started living on the coast and they became finnish tribes . 
  those who lived inland are became sami tribes . 
  most of the sources on this stuff is verbal tradition , like songs , spells and stories . 
  actually , they seem pretty happy with their autonomy . 
  it 's funny , in finland slavery was common until finland became part of sweden in the middle ages , and slavery was banned in the 1300s partly thanks to christianity . 
  originally , yes , perkele was the pagan god of thunder . 
  then when finns became christian , people started calling the devil perkele . 
  now it 's means `` satan '' . 
  yeah , i think i managed to fix it . 
  here we have the same hat as swedes do , and the boys wear suits and the girls wear dresses . 
  [ here 's a typical photo ] ( http://www.koulut.juankoski.fi/ruukinkoulu/lukio_galleria/lakkiaiset2012%20025.jpg ) we do [ the lorry thing ] ( http://www.kainuunsanomat.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2016/02/582318-1024x636.jpg ) in february , when the graduates leave the school for the studying holiday before the final exams . 
  [ finnish paganism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_paganism ) was polytheistic . 
  there were many gods . 
  here are some of the more important ones : - ukko/perkele - the god of thunder and the sky , similar to the nortse thor and the baltic perkunas - ahti - the god of water - tapio - the god of the forest and his wife mielikki - lempo - the god of love - pellervo - the god of harvest - p\u00e4iv\u00e4t\u00e4r - the goddess of the day and the sun - kuutar - the goddess of the moon there were also animistic spirits called [ haltija ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haltija ) . 
  the * haltijas * were the spirits of forests , lakes , rocks , houses , graveyards etc. 
  they were kinda like minor deities . 
  almost everything had a haltija , and you had to treat them with respect . 
  then there were the * emuu * , which were the ancestral spirits of different animals and plants . 
  the bear was considered sacred . 
  when a bear was killed there was a great celebration for it 's honor , to appease the spirit . 
  even saying it 's name was forbidden . 
  in finnish there are many nicknames for the bear because of this : otso , mesik\u00e4mmen , kontio , nalle etc. 
  even the modern finnish word for bear , * karhu * , was originally a nickname . 
  we do n't know what the real name of the bear is anymore . 
  finns believed that all humans have three souls . 
  henki was a persons life force which kept the heart beating . 
  it entered the body at the moment you were born , and left when you died . 
  * itse * was the soul which contained a persons ' personality . 
  you could loose it after a traumatizing event , especially when someone you loved died and your soul followed it to the underworld . 
  severely depressed people were though to have lost their * itse * , they were empty . 
  a shaman would have to bring back the * itse * . 
  the third soul was * luonto * , which was a persons guardian spirit , the * haltija * of a person . 
  people who were artistic , talented , or shamans , were believed to have a strong * luonto * which gave them strength and skills . 
  a baby received its * luonto * at the time when it got it 's first teeth . 
  you could loose your * luonto * by becoming an alcoholic , or breaking by an oath . 
  finns believed that all people , the good and the bad , went to the same place after they died , a realm called tuonela . 
  in some areas it was believed that people continued their lives there . 
  others believed that they slept forever . 
  to get there you had a go over a river . 
  there was a girl with a boat who would take you if you were dead . 
  living shamans who visited the land of the dead had to trick her into thinking that they were actually deceased . 
  here is a good wikipedia article on finnish paganism : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_paganism and here is an article on finnish mythology : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_mythology edit : i added some more information . 
  i do n't know anything about the baltic countries ' history prior to the 20th century . 
  here they dress up in [ masquerade costumes ] ( https://data.kosila.fi/plus/uutisosastot/20170223/1200_1200/14991549.jpg ) and drive around the city on a lorry throwing candy at people . 
  the lorries are decorated with funny pictures . 
  there was actually [ a man who declared himself the emperor of america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emperor_norton ) . 
  where would that country be ? 
  all good land is inhabited already . 
  the jews were given their own country , and that did n't work out very well for the palestinians . 
  and i do n't know if that many roma would actually move to such country . 
  if this country was , for example , in eastern europe , would finnish , spanish and british roma just leave their homes and jobs to go live in a country they 've never been to ? 
  and i 've never heard any roma organization express any will to form a country . 
  mostly they just want a better standing in the society they live in . 
  exactly . 
  my point exactly .
