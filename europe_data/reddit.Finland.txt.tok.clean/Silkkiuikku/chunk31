  i 'm pretty sure that would be illegal somehow . 
  there is a finnish word for roll-on deodorant , * kieppo * , but everyone just says roll-on . 
   95 % of the economy can be sourced within the social democratic world . 
  what is that ? 
  the us has n't done anything that would warrant an economical boycott .

  absolutely not , i like the blue and white color scheme . 
  just make sure that you make it like [ this black-white-red flag ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/ajcaaoswoudw6wdv/s-l300.jpg ) , and not like that * other * german black-white-red flag ... 
  i 've never heard of him . 
  new york and california are . 
  many estonians remember what communism is like . 
  they do n't want it back . 
  it 's generally trustworthy , and they do n't lie or make stuff up , but it 's sometimes slightly biased . 
  oh well , it 's pretty impossible to be completely objective . 
  is that the same thing as anarchists ? 
  also , savonians are happy go lucky and super chill , but also smug assholes who never say what they really mean . 
  lebanon or jordan . 
  communism is by definition anti-democracy , and it 's goal is a revolution . 
  i 'd say that 's pretty extreme . 
   at this point , as the leader of a country speaking to a peer , would you not kinda draw the line at playing to some guy 's ego just because he 's so insecure ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that the leaders of my country know that they 're not peers with the president of america any more than they 're peers with putin . 
  finland is a small country , we ca n't afford to piss off anyone powerful . 
  they do n't mean anything , most of them are just finlandized versions of swedish names , except for wednesday which is similar to the german mittwoch . 
  it 's fine , as long as they do n't expect everyone to understand and get mad at people for not answering them . 
  not everyone speaks english . 
  here in the 19th century and early 20th century working class women wore scarves daily to protect their head the from cold in the winter , and the sun in the summer . 
  now only old women wear them sometimes . 
  here are some photos : - [ in 1879 ] ( http://www.ateneum.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/edelfelt_albert_lapsen_ruumissaatto-1180x687.jpg ) - [ in 1899 ] ( http://www.maaseuduntulevaisuus.fi/image/policy:1.139161:1460862689/99445-jpg.jpg?f=default&amp;w=800&amp;$p$f$w=70578e7 ) - [ in 1910 ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/682/20081965753_3a0a3008d3_b.jpg ) - [ in 1918 ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/1e8r_kwhtifip5oaw_pizo8wzrwsuxhontligvl-ve0.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=d4cea22da1532baa55a224cf818ff303 ) - [ in 1935 ] ( https://www.kuvakokoelmat.fi/pictures/small/hk19/hk19731119_3250.jpg ) - [ in 1941-1944 ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/yyjobof4m793xmflyug6mr1xl9l-d7g6vptqimjd5tw.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=b41cc6f6e2e7d11a479a30c901482cbe ), 
  it 's a clash of cultures . 
  some of the muslims in europe have opinions , customs and traditions that europeans find downright barbaric . 
  of course the immigrants should be able to preserve their culture and religion , but some things are illegal here for a good reasons . 
  and of course , most the muslims where i live are refugees , who are mostly young jobless men far away from their family . 
  because of socio-economic reasons members of this group are slightly more likely to commit certain kinds of crimes . 
  they also seem to have difficulty with understanding how dating works here , and what is and is n't okay to do . 
  of course the wast majority of muslims who live here do n't practice illegal religious rituals , or commit crimes . 
  most of them are normal people who are perfectly capable of following our laws , but a small group is able to bring a bad reputation to everyone . 
  and then there 's isis who certainly is n't helping . 
  yes , many of them .

   native americans are generally still called `` indians '' here at least in finnish i think that people use the word * intiaani * ( indian ) out of convenience because a finnish translation of native ameircan would be something like * amerikkalaisen alkuper\u00e4iskansan edustaja * , which is very long and difficult . 
  i dont really see the problem , since the word * intiaani * is a neutral word here , not a slur . 
  and the word * intiaani * is n't the same as the finnish word for a person from india , that 's * intialainen * . 
  monday, 
  of course not . 
  i do n't think the average person thinks about them much , because somalis started coming here in the 1990s and people are used to them . 
  they 're just `` those dark skinned people who wear super covering clothing and do n't eat pork , they came here when their country went crazy '' . 
  of course , racist idiots have some very different views on the issue . 
  - [ viili ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viili ) - [ crispbread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crispbread ) with butter, 
  yes , you have to understand that `` black americans '' is a subcategory of `` americans '' . 
  and supporting trump and loving guns are stereotypes about americans . 
  where i live most african immigrants are somali , and the majority of them are sunni muslim . 
  this causes a bit of a culture clash , especially since some of their traditions and religious rituals are frowned upon , or even illegal here . 
  the stereotypes are different . 
  the negative stereotypes about black americans are the same as about all americans : talkative , loud , eat lots of junk food , weirdly religious , love guns , voted for donald the orange , worship the military , are super patriotic and sometimes they have oil wars with middle eastern countries . 
  at least where i live the negative stereotypes about sub-saharan africans are these : they 're super religious , they practice female genital mutilation , they do n't let their daughters date before marriage and make them wear headscarfs , they do n't want to integrate into our society , and some of them support extremist groups of course , these are just racist stereotypes , and most people do n't really believe in any of these things . 
  the same way we view all americans , i guess . 
  regardless of skin color you 're all loud , strange , fascinating , and a bit scary . 
  the whole concept of randomly talking to a person i do n't know feels so strange to me . 
  like , do you just start talking to random people in the street ? 
  so weird . 
  when i think of a traditional lihapiirakka i think of the kind that 's filled with minced meat and looks like [ this ] ( http://www.kymenwiener.fi/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/192_lihapiirakka_2.jpg?itok=z6p2nk1c ),

  - smilla 's sense of snow , peter hoeg - watership down , richard adams - life after life , kate atkinson - one hundred years of solitude , gabriel garc\u00eda m\u00e1rquez - american gods , neil gaiman, 
  yle.fi is pretty good , and it 's free . 
   the teacher told the children not to use the word ` murzyn ' for black people , because it is offensive and instead should be said ` afro-american okay , that makes no sense . 
  fyi africans can also be real refugees for example from somalia which is a big mess . 
  we 're supposed to say romani instead of the traditional word * mustalainen * ( gypsy ) . 
  * mustalainen * is derived from the word * musta * which means black , i believe it 's because they tend to have black hair which is rare among finns . 
  people use the word romani in official context , but many still say * mustalainen * in casual conversation . 
  many romani say that they do n't find it offensive , and some prefer it to the new word romani . 
  and the romani call themselves * kaale * ( which i think also means black ) , and they call outsiders * kaaje * . 
  some romani also use the word * tumma * which means `` dark '' . 
  then there ' the word * manne * , which is an actual slur , and only assholes use that one . 
  this reminds me of a licorice bar that we sed to have , [ it looked like this ] ( https://dalstonliteraryreview.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/lakritsi.jpg ) they changed the design after someone decided it was racist . 
  the funny thing is that i do n't think many people even realized that the picture was supposed to be an african person , i certainly did n't . 
  i thought it was a licorice person . 
  i mean , africans do n't actually have black skin like that , they have brown skin , and they do n't have bright red lips . 
  when i first heard that they were changing the design , i was so confused , because i did n't understand why anyone would find the licorice person racist . 
  then there 's the geisha chocolate bar , that used to have [ a picture of a geisha ] ( http://www.chocozone.net/images/wrappers/fazer011790948.jpg ) . 
  i still do n't understand why it 's racist to have picture of a geisha . 
  yeah , here it has also become a very bad word , because some racist assholes use it as a slur against immigrants . 
  there 's also an island in finland called `` neekerisaari '' ( negro island ) . 
  it 's because , in the past people would sometimes call journalists * lehtineekeri * ( newspaper negro ) because their hands and faces were often covered in black ink . 
  so an island where the north karelian newspapers association used to have a summer cabin , ended up being called neekerisaari . 
  i recently explained some of my older relatives why they should n't use the word `` neekeri '' . 
  they did n't know it was considered mean or racist , because to them it was just a neutral word , like `` blonde '' or `` tall '' . 
  and they 're not racist , they just honestly did n't know that they were using a racist word . 
  when they were young that word did n't have any negative connotation in finnish , and they were taught in school that people with dark brown skin are `` neekeri '' . 
  yeah , i do n't think they want to build a communist utopia anymore . 
  i guess they saw how that worked out for the russians , the chinese and the cambodians . 
  social democracy originated as a political ideology that advocated an evolutionary and peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism using established political processes in contrast to the revolutionary approach to transition associated with socialism . 
  so social democracy is socialism that rejects the idea of violent revolution being the solution . 
  modern social democracy is characterized by a commitment to policies aimed at curbing inequality , oppression of underprivileged groups , and poverty ; including support for universally accessible public services like care for the elderly , child care , education , health care , and workers ' compensation . 
  the social democratic movement also has strong connections with the labour movement and trade unions , and is supportive of collective bargaining rights for workers as well as measures to extend democratic decision-making beyond politics into the economic sphere in the form of co-determination for employees and other economic stakeholders . 
  oh , okay , that makes more sense . 
  holy shit that lopez - clash video is hilarious . 
  i also love the guy in the red shirt who unexpectedly embraces his inner martial arts master and attacks the mushroom guy with a rake .
