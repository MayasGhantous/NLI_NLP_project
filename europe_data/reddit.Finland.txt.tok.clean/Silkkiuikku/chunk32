  that video 's hilarious . 
  i love it when he randomly grabs another salesman 's salad and rebelliously throws it on the ground . 
  here 's a website that might be helpful : [ luxembourg by bike ] ( http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/visiter/que-faire/nature-et-excursions/randonnees/luxbg-velo/index.html ) . 
  and there are a bunch of biking suggestions on [ this site ] ( http://www.visitluxembourg.com/en/what-to-do/nature-tours/biking-suggestions ) . 
  there also [ a list of bike routes ] ( http://www.pistescyclables.lu ) but it 's in french . 
  i would n't be very surprised to find out that he exists , though , but i still would n't worship him . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met one , there has never many jews in finland . 
  i saw some orthodox jews when i was in antwerp though . 
  i do n't have any opinion about them , because how can you have an opinion about a people ? 
  london : i love the museums in that city , and i 'm already fluent in english . 
  i 'd probably live somewhere outside of london though , because it 's so expensive to live in london . 
  paris : because it 's so damn cool , and i speak enough french to survive 3 . 
  helsinki : in many ways it would be easy to live there , it 's a big enough city , and you can swim in the sea, 
  honestly , it 's probably because you came off as a bit ... confrontational . 
  i 'm sure you did n't mean to , but you did . 
  i only said that there are more saunas in finland than anywhere else in the world , which is a fact . 
  i said * nothing * about estonia . 
  i did n't claim that saunas are a finnish invention , nor did i say that saunas are somehow less estonian . 
  you acted like i had somehow insulted your country , putting words in my mouth . 
  and frankly the tone of your comments was kinda rude . 
  native : - other side of hope foreign : - ida - spirited away - lust , caution - eat sleep die - la strada, 
  well , the finnish word for kartanoism , * kartanolaisuus * , certainly matches the description . 
  then i must have expressed myself unclearly , my apologies , this is obviously not my first language . 
  i never said that sauna was less estonian , or that sauna is a finnish invention . 
  all i said was that there are quite a lot of saunas in finland . 
  i know those reasons , it does n't make it untrue . 
  if you want to travel around europe , why would you come to the isolated northern neck of the woods ? 
  true : many , many saunas false : we 're not actually that depressed , in fact accorgind to polls finns are one of the happiest peoples, 
  if they 're being persecuted , then they should indeed be granted asylum , that 's the law . 
  sauna is also much more common here than anywhere else in the world . 
  could it be [ kartanoism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kartanoism ) ? 
  it was a bat shit crazy cult in the 1920s-1950s . 
  maybe it was the [ conservative laestadians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_laestadianism ) ? 
  some of the more orthodox ones are pretty fundamentalist , many things are banned in their religion , like makeup , earrings , sex before marriage , birth control , pop music and tv shows . 
  it 's possible . 
  many finnish socialists helped him when he was hiding from the police . 
  i know , they can make some really creepy sounds . 
  maybe the liekki\u00f6 's were really foxes which people mistook for a ghost . 
  the story of kullervo , which is also in the kalevala , is probably the single cruelest story of finnish folk lore . 
  it 's insanely bleak and depressing . 
  you can find the whole story [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kullervo#story ) . 
  which fundamentalists are you referring to ? 
  really , really friendly people , but loud . 
  actually , that 's not quite how he looked . 
  stalin had a badly pox-marked face , but it was erased from the photos . 
  there 's also a thing called [ * mets\u00e4npeitto * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mets\u00e4npeitto ) , which is n't really a figure , but a strange state . 
  the word literally means `` cover of the forest '' . 
  the * mets\u00e4npeitto * is the realm of the spirits and the fair folk . 
  it is said that a person or animal that 's in the forest , can sometimes accidentally slip into mets\u00e4npeitto , especially if he or she angers the spirits somehow . 
  a person who is in mets\u00e4npeitto gets a strange feeling . 
  they feel that something is wrong , and the forest feels different . 
  some say that the forest suddenly goes quiet and the birds stop singing . 
  the familiar forest becomes alien , and suddenly you have no idea where you are , or how to get home . 
  everything seems unnatural and warped . 
  sometimes people will feel paralyzed and unable to move or speak , and in other cases they will wander endlessly through unfamiliar terrain . 
  you could be in your own backyard and you still would n't find your way home . 
  you 're also hidden from other people . 
  your friends may walk right past you , but you wo n't see each other . 
  there used to be all kinds of tricks that the lost person , or the people searching for him , could do to break the spell . 
  some would get out of the mets\u00e4npeitto by using magic , other 's would be called back by a wise man , while others were never found . 
  there is a theory that the phenomena is caused by some illness , like diabetes or epilepsia , which can make a person feel lost and disoriented . 
  i 've posted this before in another thread , but i figured it would fit here too : we have the liekki\u00f6 , which is a type of ghost . 
  usually it 's the spirit of a murdered child . 
  in the past unmarried women who got pregnant would sometimes give birth secretly , kill the baby and bury it in the forest . 
  as the baby had been buried in unconsecrated ground , it 's soul could not go on , but was stuck in the realm of the living . 
  so it would haunt the forest . 
  sometimes the liekki\u00f6 would appear in the form of a will o ' the wisp , and sometimes it would look like a bird . 
  the liekki\u00f6 would often scare people in the forest by following them and making strange sounds . 
  it could cry like a baby , scream , laugh , or repeat a person 's words like a creepy echo . 
  it was rarely dangerous though , and in some regions you could make it leave by saying : `` where were you when christ hung upon the cross ? '', 
  the liekki\u00f6 was often considered both a `` dead spirit '' ( vainajahenki ) and a `` forest spirit '' ( mets\u00e4nhaltija ) . 
  it was the protector of the forest and the trees . 
  a liekki\u00f6 could even protect people in the forest , by waking them up to warn them of a danger . 
  me too , a black bear on a green background would be awesome . 
  there are many theories about this . 
  it seems that lenin thought that finland would soon see how great communism is , and ask to join the ussr . 
  also , we have to remember that this happened before the second revolution when the bolsheviks seized power . 
  so lenin and the bolsheviks were still fighting for power , and lenin probably did n't want to have to deal with rebellious finns too . 
  we do n't have one founder of the nation . 
  in 1917 , after the russian revolution , the senate of finland wrote a declaration of independence and asked lenin to recognize it , which he did . 
  that 's how finland was founded . 
  `` free , firm , stable '', 
  that looks oddly socialist . 
  it 's pretty , though . 
  a [ golden lion on a crimson red backround ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/coat_of_arms_of_finland.svg/250px-coat_of_arms_of_finland.svg.png ) . 
  yes , we 're the [ lannisters ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/thumb/d/d5/house_lannister.svg/250px-house_lannister.svg.png ) . 
  it was our national emblem already before finland was independent . 
  in the russian times it was the emblem of the grand duchy of finland , and in the swedish times it was a symbol of the eastern part of sweden . 
  a very old lion of finland be found on the [ memorial of king gustav vasa of sweden ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/coat_of_arms_of_finland.jpg/450px-coat_of_arms_of_finland.jpg ) , from 1583 . 
  here 's the [ national coat of arms of russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_russian_empire_1700x1767_pix_igor_barbe_2006.jpg ) from 1882-1917 . 
  the lion is holding a sword and stamping down a saber . 
  the sword is a western weapon and the saber an eastern one . 
  the sword likely refers to sweden and the christian europe , while the saber may refer to the mongolians or the turks . 
  it seems that the roses originally did n't symbolize anything , and were just added for decoration . 
  there are nine of them , so they can be considered a symbol of the nine historical regions of finland . 
  i personally think that having a lion is kinda boring and mainstream . 
  it 's also stupid because there are no lions here . 
  but at least it 's somewhat esthetically pleasing . 
  also , the home and other buildings are usually arranged in a square like [ this ] ( http://remekset.nettisivu.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/353/2010/10/3.jpg ) . 
  usually there 's a [ cowshed ] ( http://www.nieppi.com/n/wp-content/gallery/nikon/93020007.jpg ) and stable , a [ sauna ] ( http://d3ls91xgksobn.cloudfront.net/1600x/etuovimedia/images/property/import/22/407022/83096bab1cf701cd65e15a470ff297f2/580c6823c4d51ffad403db7e117e1e0e/original.jpeg ) and an [ * aitta * ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pvtra5poe5q/u7rn3rbl4qi/aaaaaaaajxa/fhcoupyljyw/s1600/dsc08063.jpg ) which is a kind of a storage building for grain , food and clothes .
