  where are you from ? 
  the two smaller sami languages are n't doing very well , the karelian language is kinda dying out , the finnish roma dialect is pretty irrelevant because only roma speak it , almost no one speaks yiddish and the tatar language is really small too . 
  no , it 's definitely this one : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afrozersnk&amp;t=1m14s, 
  it 's kinda boring , and i rarely watch it . 
  it 's too long and most of the songs are quite uninteresting . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://www.suomela.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vanhan-talon-kosteusongelmat.jpg ) is the most common type . 
  good point . 
  being friends with russia is a good thing , and it would be very unwise indeed to piss off such a powerful country with a great army . 
  but the truth is , that russia is a corrupted oligarchy that 's lead by a man who does n't give a shit about human rights or the sovereignty of the neighboring countries . 
  russia started a war with ukraine , and they may start another war with any of their neighboring countries . 
  we do n't know who 's putin will decide to invade the next time he feels that a victorious war might be good for his popularity . 
  the music !, 
   it 's a bit strange to me how funerals in a lot of places are a week or more after the person 's death . 
  here it 's usually 1 or 2 days later . 
  maybe it 's because portugal is relatively small , so guests do n't need a long time for traveling . 
  well , that 's a bit less horrible . 
  one hymn that 's often sung at funerals is [ * maa on niin kaunis * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ow0jeewsa ) ( the earth is so beautiful ) . 
  it 's technically a christmas song , but it 's also a great song for funerals , because it discusses things like time , and the passing of generations . 
  here 's my translation of the lyrics : - the earth is so beautiful and the lord 's heaven is bright wonderful is the souls ' pilgrimage road we travel singing through the world , our journey takes our towards heaven - time flies years go by generations of men are forgotten the souls ' heavenly song remains the same - the angels were the first who sang to the shepherds the sound echoes from soul to soul glory be to the lord , the earth is peaceful for jesus brought us grace !, 
  i only know about lutheran funerals . 
  this is how it works : the guests arrive to the chapel where the coffin is . 
  the coffin is in front of the altar , and the coffin lid is always closed . 
  everyone sits down , the immediate family sits closest to the coffin . 
  the priest blesses the deceased and drops some sand on the coffin lid . 
  the priest often reads some bible verses , and the guests sing some hymns . 
  the guests place their flowers and wreaths on the coffin either in the chapel , or at the grave . 
  six people , usually close male friends and family members , carry the coffin to the grave . 
  the deceased is always carried feet first . 
  they lower the coffin into the grave , and the priest then everyone goes to the `` remembrance reception '' ( * muistotilaisuus * ) where coffee and pastries is usually served . 
  if the guests have come from a long distance , food is often served , especially in the countryside . 
  everyone talks about the deceased , and share fond memories of him or her . 
  people read [ `` adresses '' ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=adressit&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewi1w42kt-3tahxmfzokhbjxa9wq_auibigb&amp;biw=1444&amp;bih=751 ) which are short messages that have been sent by friends of the deceased , to express their condolences . 
  i know a guy who thinks trump is great and does n't believe in the evolution . 
   an older version of the german flag hanging in his room . . 
  wait , he had * that * flag hanging in his room ? 
  i think that era matters . 
  pinochet lived in the 20th century , he should have known that what he did was wrong . 
  yes , i learned it from pulp fiction . 
  also , apparently americans do n't eat french fries with mayonnaise . 
  some three glasses a day , and i also put milk in coffee . 
  mannerheim was never a dictator . 
  he was a regent of finland for a while , but that 's not the same thing . 
  after the finnish civil war mannerheim was elected temporary regent of finland . 
  in july 1919 , after he had confirmed a new republican constitution , mannerheim stood as a candidate in the first presidential election , supported by the national coalition party and the swedish people 's party . 
  he lost the election to the president of finland to kaarlo juho st\u00e5hlberg . 
  he also had some 30,000 people tortured . 
  i 've posted this in another message , but this is what they did to political prisoners : ( warning nsfl , nsfw , very graphic depiction of torture ) * `` the rape of women was common , including sexual torture such as the insertion of rats into genitals and `` unnatural acts involving dogs . '', 
  detainees were forcibly immersed in vats of urine and excrement . 
  beatings with gun butts , fists and chains were routine ; one technique known as `` the telephone '' involved the torturer slamming `` his open hands hard and rhythmically against the ears of the victim , '' leaving the person deaf . 
  at villa grimaldi , prisoners were dragged into the parking lot and had the bones in their legs crushed as they were run over with trucks . 
  '' * how can you admire a man who did this ? 
  you admire pinochet ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  during pinochet 's rule , as many as 30,000 people were tortured . 
  this is what they did to political prisoners : ( warning nsfl , nsfw , very graphic depiction of torture ) * `` the rape of women was common , including sexual torture such as the insertion of rats into genitals and `` unnatural acts involving dogs . '',

  why the hell do you admire pinochet ? 
  do you know what he did ? 
  mannerheim was n't a dictator ? 
  and more importantly , why the hell do you admire fucking pinochet ? 
  the man was a sadistic tyrant guilty of horrible crimes against his own people !, 
  wait , you mean our carl gustaf emil mannerheim ? 
  when was he a dictator ? 
  here it 's the same . 
  helsinki - spoiled rich hipster snobs who think they 're better than everyone else turku - close-minded , arrogant idiots tampere - really , really slow people lohja - there 's a saying that goes : `` better to have a fist up your ass than to live in lohja '', 
  would the correct word be occupied ? 
  i meant that no foreign power ever took control of finland . 
  finland was never successfully occupied or invaded by anyone . 
  we hate this country , but it 's still better than all the other countries . 
  but finland did n't join the axis during winter war . 
  it joined the axis during the continuation war which was after operation barbarossa . 
  they 're okay already . 
  it 's okay , but regular butter is better , especially with cheese . 
  finns were relatively lucky in ww2 because unlike almost all the other countries , finland was never occupied . 
  so the civilian population was mostly safe except for the bombing raids of course . 
  the only tragedies that i know of were men who died in the war . 
  i do n't know about anyone dying in my family , but i 've heard stories from other families . 
  there was one family that had four sons . 
  three of them died in the winter war , and the fourth one died in the continuation war . 
  i 've also heard a story about a man from my grandparent 's village . 
  during the continuation war the finland was allies with nazi-germany , and there were lots of german soldiers in finland . 
  now , the man from my grandparent 's village liked germans , and he made lots of german friends . 
  he would often give the german soldiers bread and stuff . 
  well , eventually it became evident that the soviet union would win the war , and the leaders of the finnish army wanted to make peace with the soviet union , so they would n't completely destroy finland . 
  the germans did n't want to make peace with the soviet union , hitler believed that they could still win . 
  finland made a peace agreement with the soviet union , and stalin demanded that finns force the germans to leave finland . 
  the germans of course did n't want to leave , so there was a war between finns and the germans called the lapland war . 
  the man from my grandparent 's village who liked germans ended up getting killed by one . 
  edit : i changed the word `` invaded '' to the more accurate `` occupied '', 
  i like the savonian dialect , it sounds very jovial and chill , but also a bit wry and smug . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cn7gzsiocw&amp;t=0m10s ), 
  smart and educated people who think they can get a better career in a bigger country . 
  they 're really popular here . 
  in my city there are dozens of permanent flea markets , which sell used clothes and other objects . 
  they 're indoors and they do n't sell food . 
  then there are occasional outside markets , where new goods , food and fresh produce are sold . 
  a few more : - a creepy lullaby about longing to die : [ tuuti lasta tuonelahan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzhledpsinu ) - a song about a woman who is waiting for her sweethearts ghost : [ kun mun kultani tulisi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64hilbd_jmg ) - a song about rejection : [ aamulla varhain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejidikidqcc ), 
  here are some examples of old folk songs which used to be popular : - a beautiful but kinda bitter song about love : [ sinisi\u00e4 punasia ruusunkukkia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmstkj5qlg8 ) - a very sweet song to which people danced at all celebrations , from weddings to funerals : [ himlens polska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj7zqjome7i ) - a bawdy song about a boy who wants a girl who 's mother does n't trust him : [ ievan polkka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) - a sad song about longing : [ on suuri sun rantas autius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wimjhhwyxuc ),
