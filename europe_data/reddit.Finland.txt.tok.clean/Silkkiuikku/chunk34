  quite a lot . 
  i 've been to - most of the bigger cities - the island [ ahvenanmaa / \u00c5land ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/ahvenanmaa.sijainti.suomi.2010.svg/140px-ahvenanmaa.sijainti.suomi.2010.svg.png ) , - the city of [ vaasa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/vaasa.sijainti.suomi.2013.svg/140px-vaasa.sijainti.suomi.2013.svg.png ) on the west coast - the city of [ viitasaari ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/viitasaari.sijainti.suomi.2008.svg/1200px-viitasaari.sijainti.suomi.2008.svg.png ) in central finland - the municipality of [ kolari ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/kolari.sijainti.suomi.2010.svg/140px-kolari.sijainti.suomi.2010.svg.png ) in lapland - and the russian border in [ imatra ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/imatra.sijainti.suomi.2008.svg/1200px-imatra.sijainti.suomi.2008.svg.png ) . 
  but \u00c5 makes no sense . 
  why is it that in swedish '' \u00e5ker '' is spelled with \u00c5 , but `` orka '' is spelled with o ? 
  also , why the hell are some words like \u00e4lv , \u00e4lg , or \u00e4ngel written with an \u00c4 , when they obviously should be written with an e ? 
  your language is so confusing . 
  yeah , i would n't call it a rivalry . 
  it 's more like the finns are permanently pissed off about being in the sphere of influence of a creepy superpower . 
  it 's like having an angry bear as your neighbor , and knowing that it may decide eat you one day . 
  so we have to avoid pissing off russia and hope that we do n't end up like ukraine . 
  but most finns have nothing against the russian people . 
  putin is a millionaire piece of shit , and the kreml is a viper 's nest of corrupted liars , but ordinary russians are n't worse than any other people . 
  you can take the '' \u00e5 '' it 's such a stupid swedish letter . 
  being smug is stupid . 
  i prefer to be openly hostile : saatanan svedupelle , painu helvettiin perkele !, 
  finlandia by jean sibelius is kinda like our second anthem . 
  it 's much more beautiful than the actual national anthem . 
  here 's an awesome flashmob of the song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jakko3vgany&amp;t=1s, 
  this is one of the two swedish drinking songs that i know . 
  here they make everyone read the war novel * unknown soldiers * by v\u00e4in\u00f6 linna , and * seven brothers * by aleksis kivi , which is the first novel ever written in finnish, 
  what 's your favorite story in kalevala ? 
  oh , yes , certainly . 
  there 's the sea monster [ iku-turso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iku-turso ) , the buried giant [ antero vipunen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antero_vipunen ) , the pain girl , [ the nine diseases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nine_diseases ) , the [ hiisi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiisi ) and his giant elk , the giant eagle , the giant pike and the girl who rows the boat to the realm of the dead , and a bunch of gods and nature spirits . 
  sweden i guess . 
  they 're like an annoying older brother that 's richer and luckier . 
  many of what ? 
  unknown soldiers by v\u00e4in\u00f6 linna . 
   people talking about `` nazis '' and `` the far right '' as if that 's an actual , present-day issue just a few days ago i saw a group of nazis in the street . 
  they were wearing red armbands with pseudo-swastikas . 
  that 's present day enough for me . 
  wait , if estonian women ca n't be around children topless , then how do they shower or go to sauna in public swimming baths ? 
  i think that sokos should be number two . 
  * `` parempi virsta v\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4\u00e4 kuin vaaksa vaaraa '' * literally : `` better to walk 1 069 meters to the wrong direction , than 20 cm on a dangerous road . '', 
  * virsta * and * vaaksa * are archaic measurements . 
  a * virsta * is the length of a field , approximately 1 069 meters . 
  * vaaksa * is the distance between the tips of little finger and thumb , approximately 20-25 cm . 
  the meaning is something like : `` it 's better to take the long and safe road , than the dangerous shortcut '' . 
  we have some other weird measurements like * `` kivenheitto '' * ( how far you can throw a rock ) , and * `` peninkulma '' * ( how far you can hear a dog bark ) . 
  then there 's * `` poronkusema '' * which is the distance a reindeer walks before pissing . 
  here it 's : * anna pirulle pikkusormi , niin se vie koko k\u00e4den * if you give the devil your pinky , he 'll take the whole hand, 
  yeah , here we definitely do n't have wild boars hanging around in the cities . 
  [ siberian flying squirrels ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/01/article-2167362-13e078b4000005dc-259_634x462.jpg ) are pretty neat . 
  the [ anguis fragilis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anguis_fragilis ) looks like a snake , but is actually a limbless lizard . 
  we have some pretty cool birds : - [ kingfisher ] ( http://animal-dream.com/data_images/kingfisher/kingfisher4.jpg ) - [ capercaillie ] ( https://haydensanimalfacts.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/western-capercaillie.jpg ) - [ bullfinch ] ( http://animalia-life.club/data_images/eurasian-bullfinch/eurasian-bullfinch4.jpg ) - [ goldfinch ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8dmtbejh6x0/vl6whu4rxui/aaaaaaaajjw/tfmcjb3e1d0/s1600/goldfinch.jpg ) - [ black woodpecker ] ( http://orientalbirdimages.org/images/data/black_woodpecker01.jpg ) - the [ nightingale ] ( https://images8.alphacoders.com/449/449399.jpg ) which sings like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2_bcqcod4 ) - the [ siberian jay ] ( http://www.vuodenluontokuva.fi/vlk/userfiles/vlk/2009/galleria/linnut%20kari%20leo%20mets\u00e4n%20em\u00e4nt\u00e4.jpg ) which is a bold bird that [ does n't fear humans ] ( http://www.hlp.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bg4.jpg ) like other forest birds . 
  sometimes it comes to hunters ' campfires to [ beg for food ] ( http://www.vartsi.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kuukkeli_kulkijan_kaveri.jpg ) . 
  it 's said that it brings luck , and if you kill one , you loose your hunting luck and will never hit your target again . 
  in the past people believed that siberian jays were dead hunters ' souls . 
  i think that encounters with wild boars are pretty rare , but some farmers work in close proximity to cows every day . 
  so the risk of getting killed by a cow is higher . 
  in central europe there are [ wildcats ] ( http://mammals.myspecies.info/sites/mammals.myspecies.info/files/european-wildcat-cat-snow-nature-scotland.jpg ) . 
  it 's the ancestor of the domestic cat . 
  it 's much bigger and stouter than the domestic cat , and has anger fur . 
  males average a weight of 5 kg ( 11 lb ) up to 8 kg ( 18 lb ) . 
  large males in spain reach 65 cm ( 26 in ) in length , with a 34.5 cm ( 13.6 in ) long tail , and weigh up to 7.5 kg ( 17 lb ) . 
  yeah , the saimaa ringed seal is actually pretty unusual , since it only lives in one place in the world : lake saimaa in finland . 
  also , they 're not famous , and the only living noble i 've ever heard of is the last mannerheim . 
  the name mannerheim is famous thanks to carl gustaf mannerheim , who was commander-in-chief of finland 's defence forces during the wars , and a bit of a military genius . 
  there is a list of [ finnish noble families ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_finnish_noble_families ) . 
  almost all of hem have fancy swedish , german or russian names . 
  there are 6000 nobles alive in finland . 
  some are still pretty rich , but it seems that most are ordinary people . 
  many speak swedish as their first language , as that used to be the language of the rich elite . 
  they have a fancy party every year at the house of nobility . 
  i know some fun fortune telling traditions . 
  when i was a child i used to do a spell every midsummer eve . 
  i 'd pick nine different flowers from nine different meadows and put them under my pillow before going to bed . 
  i was supposed to see my future husband in my dreams . 
  but i had to be quiet while picking the flowers , because if you speak while doing it , you ruin the spell . 
  and on new year 's eve we melt pieces of tin with my family . 
  everyone would melt a piece of tin on the stove , then drop it in a bucket of snow . 
  it would melt into a weird blob . 
  you 're supposed to be able to tell your future by holding the blob in candle light and looking at the shadow on the wall . 
  we have the [ liekki\u00f6 ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/liekki\u00f6 ) , which is a type of ghost . 
  usually it 's the spirit of a murdered child . 
  in the past unmarried women who got pregnant would sometimes give birth secretly , kill the baby and bury it in the forest . 
  as the baby had been buried in unconsecrated ground , it 's soul could not go on , but was stuck in the realm of the living . 
  so it would haunt the forest . 
  sometimes the liekki\u00f6 would appear in the form of a will o ' the wisp , and sometimes it would look like a bird . 
  the liekki\u00f6 would often scare people in the forest by following them and making strange sounds . 
  it could cry like a baby , scream , laugh , or repeat a person 's words like a creepy echo . 
  it was rarely dangerous though , and in some regions you could make it leave by saying : `` where were you when christ hung upon the cross ? '', 
  the liekki\u00f6 was often considered both a `` dead spirit '' ( * vainajahenki * ) and a `` forest spirit '' ( * mets\u00e4nhaltija * ) . 
  it was the protector of the forest and the trees . 
  a liekki\u00f6 could even protect people in the forest , by waking them up to warn them of a danger . 
  norwegian . 
  i speak swedish , so i can understand norwegian fairly well , but i ca n't speak it at all . 
  unfortunately no . 
  in finnish , depending on the dialect , the d can either disappear or be replaced by another letter . 
  in many finnish dialects the letter `` d '' is pretty non-existent , so many finns ca n't really pronounce it , which is probably what happened to london . 
  and in finnish nouns rarely end with an `` n '' . 
  on [ finnish wikipedia ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/lontoo ) , it says that there are 11\u00a0905\u00a0500 people in london and the `` urban area '' whatever that means . 
  but there are only a bit more five million people here . 
  there are twice as many people living in london . 
  i think that in nordic countries you can sometimes hug a friend , but you only ever kiss people in a romantic situation . 
  normally it 's for toxic gas or nuclear hazards . 
  in case of war they function as air raid sirens . 
  here it 's every monday at noon . 
  yeah , i 've none some kids who were adopted from africa . 
  one of them said that random people who thought she was an immigrant would sometimes tell her to `` go back home '' . 
  in general happy people tend to be healthier , and depressed or stressed people are more prone to sickness .
