  if having faith in something helps a person stay happy , that can help them stay healthy . 
  sweden . 
  it 's not in nato , and it 's not russia . 
  estonia is the smallest one , and it should be the easiest to conquer , but attacking estonia would not only piss off nato , but russia too . 
  i think that using faith medicine in addition to actual medicine , may help the patient to stay optimistic . 
  being optimistic and in high spirits actually does help you heal . 
  well there 's cupping , in which blood is removed with the help of suction cups . 
  it 's from the time when people believed that illness was caused by bad blood which needed to be let out . 
  here 's a [ nsfw photo ] ( http://akaanseutu.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/22kuppari11.jpg ) . 
  then there 's something called [ * j\u00e4senkorjaus * ] ( http://fonecta-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/fonecta1243__mg_0144.jpg ) , which roughly translates to `` limb fixing '' . 
  then there are all kinds of religious faith healers , and foreign stuff like ayurveda , acupuncture , chiropractics and reflexology . 
  colombia . 
  netflix, 
   us and canada are by far , the most accepting countries .

  now you 're being too hard on finland . 
  we have a few guys named pekka and juha too . 
  i call everyone by their first names except for my mother , father , grandmother and grandfather . 
  [ lake saimaa ] ( https://www.saimaatravel.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/saimaa21.png ) in finland . 
  it 's the largest lake in finland and the fourth largest lake in europe . 
  it 's very clean and the water is [ quite clear ] ( http://www.saimaa-adventures.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ahven-perch-perca-fluviatilispaorama.jpg ) . 
  and there 's a species of seal that only lives in lake saimaa : [ the saimaa ringed seal ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1200,h_800,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/13-3-9377421.jpg ) . 
  and it 's in finland , so you can admire the [ light summer nights ] ( https://kk-static.fi/photos/5/6/d/5/2/orig/56d52ed5568f41db118466934acc735a29b699ef.jpg ) , and go to sauna . 
  jaywalking gets you a 60 euro fine here . 
  i 'm sure many people give plenty of shits about that . 
  op might care . 
  that 's nice . 
  i wish the russians would take a leaf from your book . 
  ukraine is also a quiet nation that is n't bothering anyone , but russian attacked it all the same . 
  yeah , except that i do n't think that america would be too happy to attack finland , because that would definitely piss off the russians . 
  it 's nice living in a buffer state . 
  make all schools public and free !, 
  make school lunches free for all students !, 
  make university free !, 
  shorten prison sentences !, 
  end solitary confinement !, 
  end death sentence !, 
  make stricter gun laws !, 
  raise taxes !, 
  i do n't think working with nazi-germany necessarily made finns more racist , though . 
  i mean , the us and britain worked with stalin 's soviet union and it did n't make them more communist . 
  also , i 'm not sure if it 's legal to secretly record someone . 
  [ here ] ( http://keskustelu.suomi24.fi/t/5980728/nauhoitus--poliisi-vastaa ) is an answer from the police to someone asking about a similar situation . 
  apparently the law is a bit complicated . 
  that 's whataboutism . 
  eu does n't get to be shitty just because america is even shittier . 
  this i did n't know about . 
  thanks for the information . 
  yeah , i guess it 's what they call a `` he said , she said '' situation . 
  yeah , it sound like a difficult situation . 
  it 's kinda hard to prove that some employer did n't hire you because of your skin color . 
  what are those weak , pale buns ? 
  clearly you have never seen [ real bread ] ( http://www.kainuunsanomat.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2017/01/354480-1024x812.jpg ) . 
  is n't there someplace you could report that ? 
  you know it 's a crime for employers to discriminate like this , right ? 
  do you know why they escaped ? 
  because of the bombings ? 
  i 'm curious , which war do you mean ? 
  that sucks . 
  those employers you mention are fucking assholes . 
  18 , i was a weird teen . 
  banning people from entering a country because of their religion is barbaric , anti-democratic and very stupid . 
  in civilized countries we have this thing called `` freedom of religion '' , and that includes islam . 
  if we install a muslim ban , we sacrifice one of the defining values of our culture . 
  and if we act against our principles by destroying freedom of religion , we cause more damage to our countries than isis ever could . 
  i live in a democratic country where everyone is free to pray to whichever god they like . 
  and i wo n't allow a few isis jihadist scumbags to change that . 
  i believe that our democracy is stronger than their guns , bombs or trucks . 
  finland 's pretty all right in many ways . 
  100 years ago it was a poor agrarian country , and look how far we 've gotten . 
  yes , i think it 's a good country that we should love and cherish . 
  peking duck !, 
  oatmeal porridge is the cheapest thing i know . 
  why do you call it the white party though ? 
  only a bit more than a half of white americans are republicans . 
  the rest are democrats . 
  also , quite a lot of republicans are non-white . 
  `` red '' means republican , right ? 
  well why would white democrats move to these republican states ? 
  you say this is a fact , yet where 's your proof ? 
  and no , we should n't judge trump for the kind of people that show up in support at his rallies . 
  a peaceful separation could actually be a nice idea . 
  america likes to play world leader though , would you accept no being as big and powerful as before ? 
  and if there were two america 's , then both would want to be more powerful than the other . 
   want to remove us demographically from america no offense , but that sounds like conspiracy theory . 
  white people are what , 70 % of the population ? 
  how does one remove 70 % of the population ? 
  that does n't make sense , especially considering how the majority of influential rich corporation owners and millionaires are white . 
   hillary even had the orlando shooter 's father in her rally behind her so ? 
  are n't rallies public events , so anyone can walk in ? 
  you should n't judge politicians by the people who stroll into their rallies . 
  also , i do n't think that the shooter 's father should be blamed for his son 's actions . 
   and yeah civil war might happen you say that so casually . 
  do you think war is a joke ? 
  in 1918 there was a civil war in finland . 
  and let me tell you , i 've heard enough stories of that war to know that it should never happen again . 
  would you ind specifying exactly what ideas hillary is antitethical to ? 
  and what place does she wish to remove you from ?
