  maybe they 'd never met american before and were curious ? 
  some of my old relatives have done it , i do n't think there was anything interesting . 
  i descend from a long line of farmhands and maids . 
  what 's with the giant necktie ? 
  and the oldest building in my city is [ this little church ] ( https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5573/14346259220_ecdb060f07_b.jpg ) from the 12th century . 
  we do n't have anything super old , the oldest buildings are from the medieval era . 
  the [ jomala church ] ( http://www.domnik.net/photos/tp/00/04/b/5.jpg ) , the building of which started in the 1270s . 
  then there 's the [ turku castle ] ( http://www.horizont.fi/horizont/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cr4-horizont-kuva_turunlinna.jpg ) the oldest parts of which are from the 11th century . 
  the [ h\u00e4me castle ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7353/13930878176_bb3bc2506e_b.jpg ) is also form the 11th century . 
  the oldest surviving man-made structures are probably the [ grave cairns ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/hiidenkiuas_kotkassa_1.jpg/1200px-hiidenkiuas_kotkassa_1.jpg ) some of which are from the late stone age ( 2000 - 1500 bc . ), 
  the finnish word for them is * hiidenkiuas * . 
  a [ * kiuas * ] ( http://www.anttilantila.fi/wp-content/themes/anttilantila/images/savusauna1_iso.jpg ) is the pile of rocks which you use to heat up a sauna . 
  * hiisi * is an evil mythical creature . 
  people used to believe that the hiisi built the cairns to use as a giant sauna heater . 
  why did you vote for him , though ? 
  i mean , trump has many really horrible opinions . 
  he advocates torture , he want to ban muslims from entering the us , he does n't want poor people to have access to health care ... and he has absolutely no manners , he likes to insult women , war veterans , the disabled and pretty much anyone who disagrees with him . 
  i do n't understand why anyone in their right mind would vote for such a person . 
  pardon my ignorance , what 's a `` base '' ? 
  thank you , it would be so awkward to accidentally kill them . 
  still sucks . 
  i kinda hoped he 'd get his shit together once he actually became a president , but nope . 
  normal . 
  it 's more popular among boys though . 
  yes , i 'm pretty sure it is . 
  i 've never seen anyone display a stalinist symbol , but i 've seen soviet symbols , like those old hats with red stars . 
  and there are a few lenin statues in finland . 
  luckily i 'm not a dog . 
  we have the same thing , * vanhempi * ( older ) , and * nuorempi * ( younger ) . 
  right now i 'm in finland . 
  but i 've spent enough time abroad to not to take xylitol granted . 
  free translation : `` you 're really shitty as satan , for cunt 's sakes . 
  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  by perkele , you 're such a swine-like weakling that even the devil ca n't stand you . 
  such a snot-nosed piss-headed dick !, 
  by the summer of cunts and the cold spell of cocks ! '', 
  edit : changed some words for accuracy, 
  chewing gum with xylitol . 
  it 's funny , i never knew that some countries have `` victory days '' . 
  it makes sense of course , but i 'd never thought about it . 
  we only have stuff like `` national veterans ' day '' and `` commemoration day of fallen soldiers '' , because finland never won a war . 
  some russian prisoners of war were put in my grandfathers farm , . 
  my grandfather was a child at the time . 
  he has no negative memories of them , and says that they were good singers . 
  in their free time they also made pretty rings from scrap metal , i 've seen one . 
  when the war ended , finland had to send all the prisoners of war back to the soviet union . 
  but the prisoners at my grandfather 's farm all ran away . 
  my grandfather thinks that they did it because they did n't want to be sent back home . 
  they probably knew that stalin would have them killed or sent them to gulags , because stalin hated soldiers who surrendered to the enemy . 
  my grandfather thinks that the prisoners probably tried to get escape sweden , and he hopes that they made it . 
  sarcastic , cynical and very dark . 
  depends on what you mean with conforming . 
  i do n't give a shit about how people dress , or what they eat , or what god they pray to . 
  it 's none of my business , this is a free country and immigrants can eat spiders and worship cthulhu for all i care . 
  but i am annoyed at those who refuse to conform to our laws . 
  i think that if something is illegal in your host country , you absolutely do n't have the right to do it , even if it 's an important part of your culture or religion . 
  i ca n't accept immigrants practicing female genital mutilation , killing their daughters for honor , or , god forbid , joining isis . 
  if they wish to live here , they will have to abstain from doing these things . 
  of course , we live in a democracy , and they can try to change the laws if they like . 
  but they ca n't just ignore them . 
  i 'm not nobility , so no . 
  `` okay , cool . '', 
  i think that calling people `` black '' is a pretty new thing here . 
  before , people would just say that someone has dark skin , or is from africa . 
  `` black people '' are n't really a homogenous cultural group here since they come from many different countries and cultures . 
  they all have immigrant background of course , some of them are migrants , some of them are refugees . 
  i think that most people here assume that every black person they meet is somali , because so many somalis live here . 
  their culture is obviously quite different from ours , and when they come here they 're forced to abandon some of their culture . 
  for example , some of their religious traditions , like female genital mutilation , are illegal here . 
  i do n't really know how my country treats them , to be honest . 
  many people say that finland does n't help them enough with integration . 
  but no one really seems to know what exactly we should do to help them . 
  some people immigrant background write articles about how marginalized they feel , because they 're surrounded by white finns who have a different culture . 
  many people also say that they 've encountered racism , like random people yelling nasty slurs at them in the street . 
  i do n't know what the fuck is wrong with people who do that . 
  buying second hand clothes is very popular and there are lots of flea markets in every city . 
  it 's considered smart , environmentally friendly and also kinda fashionable . 
  there 's also [ rapakivi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapakivi_granite ) which is a type of granite . 
  lots of finns even emigrated there in the 1800s . 
  i just had a lengthy argument with an american redditor about this exact subject . 
  he simply refused to believe that finland lost the war and was absolutely certain that he knew my country 's history better than me . 
  it was so weird , i mean , how is it even possible to think that finland won a war against the soviet union ? 
  has he never seen a map ? 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  why hell would anyone pronounce it like that ? 
  i think you misinterpreted your source . 
  it says `` according to the study , 45 % ** of tattooed people ** in birmingham boasted between 11 and 15 inking '', 
  for us it 's like this : - alexander i - he annexed finland from sweden , which was great , alexander was much cooler than the king of sweden , he gave us autonomy - nicholas i - idk , he did n't really care about us , he was pretty conservative and had a strict censorship policy alexander ii - the best tsar ever , we still have his statue on the senate square , he did lots of important reforms and was good to finland alexander iii - i think this one was kinda okay nicholas ii - this one we really hate , he tried to russify finland and take away all the special rights and probably the autonomy too, 
  1 . skirt , t-shirt , tights 2 . some kinda vegetarian pasta , milk 3 . internet being slow 4 . gloomy 5 . 
  that sounds like fun . 
  i forget stuff all the time, 
  literally everyone has relatives who fought in the war , but they 're either really old or dead . 
  even the youngest vets are in their 90s . 
  most of them never talk about it , ever . 
  wow , that second story is insane . 
  gypsies in finland are n't traveller anymore , they live in houses and have jobs like everyone else . 
  there are a lot of them in my city , they 're easy to recognize because they wear really [ elaborate traditional clothing ] ( https://kotiliesi.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/romani_janita_kokovkuva.jpg ) . 
  i 've personally never had any negative experiences with them . 
  estonia .
