  in finnish it 's `` is\u00e4nmaa '' , father 's land . 
  but native language is '' \u00e4idinkieli '' , mother 's language . 
  hot , with lots of casinos , rich people and wannabe celebrities . 
  nice place for vacation . 
  the finnish word * ryss\u00e4 * is n't very a nice word . 
  it 's not something you 'd want to say to a russian person , unless you wan na be mean . 
  there are also a bunch of sayings with the word like : '' * ryss\u00e4 on ryss\u00e4 vaikka voissa paistais * '' ( a ruskie stays a ruskie even if you fry it in butter ) , and * yksi suomalainen vast kymment\u00e4 ryss\u00e4\u00e4 * '' ( `` one finn is as good as ten ruskies '' ) . 
  then there 's the verb '' * ryssi\u00e4 * '' which means `` to fuck up '' . 
  some older people use the word * ryss\u00e4 * when they talk about russians , because they 're still a bit bitter about the war . 
  well , lots of older people call russians `` ruskies '' ( * ryss\u00e4 * ) and are kinda suspicious of them . 
  and a lot of people are also a bit racist towards roma . 
  there are a lot of stereotypes about them , like that they shoplift and start fights and do n't complete second degree education . 
  and some weirdos are racist towards the swedish speaking minority , because they feel that they have too many rights for such a small minority . 
  then there is the racism against immigrants from the middle east and north africa , especially now after the refugee crisis . 
  this racism is much nasties , and more serious . 
  i think some of it is because of cultural differences . 
  they 're overrepresented in certain crime statistics , which is probably because of to reason . 
  i think it 's because some things that are okay in their culture , are n't okay here . 
  and they find it hard to understand some of our rules and laws . 
  and then there are some activist of immigrant decent who do mildly racist things , like organize a `` no whites allowed '' event , or write an article about how only white people can be racist . 
  and then we have the neo-nazi crowd who love fucking putin , and who just want to kill anyone with a slightly darker skin . 
  these are the kinda people who go around screaming how we need to deport all the `` rapist mooslem niggers '' . 
  they 're all a bunch of delusional motherfuckers who need to get a fucking life and stop fucking harassing people . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://travelscams.org/europe/common-tourist-scams-italy/ ) a list about common tourist scams , she should probably check it out . 
  i took both the mandator and all the voluntary history courses in my high school because i did the final exam of history . 
  this is what i remember learning either in class or studying for exams : - people living in the indus river region started practicing agriculture around the same time as the egyptians and mesopotamians - at some point the moguls ( ? ), 
  who were muslim conquered india - in the 1700s europeans liked to buy spices from india . 
  some european country ( i ca n't remember which ) traded a lot with india , and sold the stuff to other european countries making a huge profit . 
  - in the 1800s the british colonized india . 
  they used a strategy called `` divide and conquer '' which meant that they would help certain local groups and leaders to gain their support against other indians . 
  during british rule india 's economical development plummeted as all the profit went to britain . 
  - there was a huge famine at some point and the british did n't give a shit . 
  - the lawyer mohandas `` mahatma '' gandhi and nehruand some other people lead a huge independence movement . 
  gandhi was a pacifist and an advocator of non-violent resistance . 
  india became independent relatively peacefully in the 1950s . 
  - gandhi was assassinated . 
  and gandhi 's daughter became a president at some point , and she was assassinated too i think . 
  - for some reason pakistan became independent from india . 
  all the muslims were supposed to move to pakistan , and the hindus were supposed to go to india . 
  lots of people were moving and it was a big mess . 
  the rest of the stuff i learned was about the current day situation . 
  make sure you say hello to all passer-bys !, 
  who cares ? 
  heimdall 's a god , he can be whatever color he wants . 
  i 'm not a scandinavian in the strictest sense of the word , but i 'm very enthusiastic about norse mythology . 
  i like marvel 's depiction of thor . 
  it 's pretty similar to his portrayal in mythology . 
  he 's is brave , but also boastful and not very smart . 
  in the myths he 's a lot more aggressive , and always picking fights . 
  the portrayal of loki is great , that 's what he 's like in the stories . 
  he 's the god of chaos and he always ruins everything , even if it 's against his own best interests . 
  one day he causes the apocalypse and gets himself killed . 
  he ca n't help himself , it 's his nature , he 's a trickster god . 
  the marvel version of odin is really boring though . 
  he 's supposed to be the god of wisdom , a sly and cunning old man . 
  i mean , he sold his eye to gain wisdom , and hanged himself to gain knowledge . 
  but in the marvel movies he does n't do anything interesting . 
  btw , i wish they 'd make a movie about ragnar\u00f6k that would be like the myth . 
  so there 's an epic battle between gods and giants . 
  the great wolf fenrir escapes his chains and kills odin , and odin 's son v\u00ed\u00f0ar slays the wolf . 
  loki and heimdall stab each other and both die . 
  thor decapitates the great midgard serpent , but the head bites him and so he dies too . 
  mid 19th to early 20th century europe .

  well , there was the whole `` putin cheese '' thing : the finnish dairy product company * valio * used to sell lots of products , including cheese , to russia . 
  so they made cheese with [ russian writing on the package ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/juustoetuik1508_uu.jpg ) . 
  then in 2014 when the eu set sanctions against russia because of their actions in ukraine , * valio * could n't sell cheese to russian , so they had to sell all the cheese with russian writing in finland instead . 
  they sold it for about half of the normal price . 
  the cheese was soon nicknamed `` putin cheese '' . 
  there were [ advertisements in grocery stores ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/thanks.jpg ) with the text : `` spasibo putin !, 
  cheese is cheap now ! '', 
  i remember reading about that in a finnish newspaper , lol . 
  the director aki kaurism\u00e4ki pretty much created his own genre . 
  well [ ievan polkka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) , which is pretty famous on the internet , is sung in a strong north-savonian dialect . 
  i think the time period between 1880 and 1917 is a very interesting one for finland . 
  there was what we call `` the times of oppression '' when the russian empire aimed at limiting the special status of finland and possibly the termination of its political autonomy . 
  finnish painters , writers and composers were busy building a national identity and fighting oppression through art . 
  there was what we call `` the golden period of finnish art '' . 
  both in finland and the rest of the russian empire there were lots of strikes and political uprisings . 
  then in 1917 the russian revolution happened and finland became independent . 
  ** you one-eared marijuana smoking bikefucker !!, 
  ! , you 're just jealous 'cause finland will always win !, 
  i will go full on winter war on you , and sacrifice you to the mighty perkele , and your feed your unholy hot potato language to a polar bear !!!, 
  ** no i do n't meant fucking poffertjes , you clog-wearing flatland tulip-man !, 
  you ignorant heretic !!!, 
  blins and pancakes are a completely different species !, 
  just by reading the title , i knew that this was going to be about paavo v\u00e4yrynen . 
  we eat [ blins with smetana and fish eggs ] ( http://www.dlc.fi/~marian1/gourmet/pic/blin.jpg ) , and for desert we have [ pasha ] ( https://kotiliesi.fi/wp-content/uploads/kl/ruokaideat/pasha.jpg ) and [ m\u00e4mmi with cream ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/m\u00e4mmi-2.jpg ) . 
  to me it sounds really cool , because it 's the language of movies and tv shows . 
  everything sounds more badass in english . 
  they 're human beings , same as everyone else . 
  some are great people , some are assholes . 
  all the russians i personally know are really nice people .
