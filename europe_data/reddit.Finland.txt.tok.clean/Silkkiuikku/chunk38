  i love the clicking sounds in xhosa . 
  it sounds like those clicking sounds some birds like wheatears or capercaillies make . 
  french and german bot sounds very nice . 
  out of none european languages , i like greenlandic and other inuit languages . 
  no , people just use them for fortune telling . 
  like an unnaturally perky russian speaking . 
  pretty common , but it 's getting more and more uncommon . 
  i ca n't remember , and it 's possible that i misremember . 
  i 'm assuming that by `` america '' you mean the united states and not the whole continent . 
  i took all the history courses in high school and this is what i we were taught : - the different native american tribes , their livelihoods ( agriculture , hunter-gathering , fishing etc ) , some tribes ' politics systems too especially the iroquois - the colonization of north america and the arrival of european settlers and pilgrims - the genocide of the native americans , the trail of tears , wounded knee etc. 
  - the war against france - the boston tea party and the declaration of independence - the slave trade - the civil war and abolishment of slave trade - us involvement in ww1 - the us involvement in ww2 , the bombing of hiroshima and the division of berlin - the truman doctrine and us interventions in politics in latin american countries , like chile - cold war events like the cuban missile crisis - the civil rights thing , martin luther king , rosa parks etc. 
  - vietnam war and how it was perceived by americans - watergate - the afganistan war -9 / 11 and the iraq war - the current situation of the native americans and african americans - latin american immigration into the u.s. . we did n't have time to through all of this in the lessons though , some of it i had to study independently from the books before exams, 
  there are n't any . 
  finland , 18 this is what i remember learning : - the middle age era was very short in lithuania - lithuania was occupied by the soviet union for decades like estonia and latvia . 
  depends on your definition of the word . 
  absolutely , but we should find a way to make sure that they 're actual refugees . 
  unfortunately , some people who come here are n't actually in any danger , and so they should n't apply for asylum . 
  i also think that we should deport refugees who commit serious crimes , or who visits syria , fight for isis , and then come back . 
  everyone has preferences . 
  some people like blonds , some like tall people , some love muscles etc. 
  i do n't think you 're any more likely to encounter racism here than you are in america . 
  i mean , there are assholes in every country , right ? 
  but people are going to make fun of your president once they find out that you 're american . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  are you high or something ? 
  rikssvenska sounds very jumpy , chirpy and a bit nasal . 
  holy shit , it looks like they lit themselves on fire . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure this is the most famous one . 
  it 's one of my all-time favorite paintings . 
  edit : spelling, 
  these are also very well known : [ the garden of death ] ( http://www.simbergintoinenmaailma.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kuoleman_puutarha.jpg ) by hugo simberg [ a child 's funeral ] ( http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?action=image&amp;iid=a0260800&amp;profile=topicartworkbignew ) by albert edelfelt [ the fighting capercaillies ] ( http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?action=image&amp;iid=m0597004&amp;profile=topicartworkbignew ) by ferdinand von wright [ a boy and a crow ] ( http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?action=image&amp;iid=x0144802&amp;profile=topicartworkbignew ) by akseli gallen-kallela, 
  i do n't know which is the most famous , but everyone knows these : [ burning the brushwood ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/raatajat_rahanalaiset.jpg/1200px-raatajat_rahanalaiset.jpg ) by eero j\u00e4rnefelt [ and old woman and a cat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/gallen_akkajakissa.jpg ) by akseli gallen-kallela [ lemmink\u00e4inen 's mother ] ( http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?action=image&amp;iid=x0020600&amp;profile=topicartworkbignew ) by akseli gallen-kallela [ the defense of the sampo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/sammon_puolustus.jpg/1200px-sammon_puolustus.jpg ) by akseli gallen-kallela [ the wounded angel ] ( http://www.simbergintoinenmaailma.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/haavoittunut_enkeli.jpg ) by hugo simberg, 
  in finland 4 000 people were forcibly sterilized between 1935 -- 1970 . 
  many disorders such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and mental retardation could be considered grounds for sterilization , especially when combined with criminality . 
  the sterilizations were based on eugenistic ideas of weeding out hereditary disorders from the population . 
  btw , i read an article about some finnish sami who travelled to work as an attraction at a human zoo in germany , i think it was in the 1930s . 
  they would hang around in a cage pretending to be `` primitive '' before the visitors . 
  then after their working day was done they 'd go sightseeing and enjoy the big city life . 
  i do n't think there are any folk songs that everyone knows , but these are pretty well known : [ kalliolle kukkulalle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0b1eqpq2qm9 ) [ hummani hei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6atayqilfq ), 
  here smaller stores usually only have a toilet for employees , they do n't let customers use it at all . 
  wait , do ordinary shops let people use the toilet in the us ? 
  or do you mean supermarkets ? 
  yeah , that sure would be nice . 
  maybe , i do n't know how much the conscription and civil service cost . 
  you forgot putin . 
  nope . 
  well , getting rid of conscription is n't really a good idea considering our geopolitical position . 
  we need a big enough army to make invasion of finland such an expensive operation , that no country will wish to invade . 
  our army is a deterrent , it 's supposed to make sure that the costs of invasion outweigh any benefits . 
  we have a population on 5,5 million people . 
  an army that consists solely of volunteers probably would n't be big enough . 
  and i think that not getting invaded is a pretty good way to promote social justice . 
  i mean , things would probably get much worse if we 'd get invaded by , say , a homophobic oligarchy where journalists and dissidents are routinely murdered . 
  i do think that male-only conscription is unequal and old-fashioned . 
  it 's unfair that only men are conscripted , and as a woman i would n't mind conscription becoming mandatory for everyone . 
  in israel they have mandatory conscription for both genders , and apparently women can shoot just as well as men . 
  that being said , only conscripting half of the population does make sense financially . 
  training is expensive , and not everybody will be sent to fight in a war anyways . 
  yeah , i think there should be mandatory conscription for both genders . 
  conscription is a necessary evil , but we should make it equal at least . 
  that 's interesting , i never thought about that . 
  i donut think so . 
  i think that the reason threads about refugees are so shitty is because most people do n't really have a strong opinion about anything , and so they do n't bother with writing a comment . 
  but the xenophobic scumbags are really passionate about the topic , and they comment in every single thread about refugees , and up vote each other . 
  they 're a small , but very loud group . 
  well , if someone tried to invade a part of finland , we 'd probably assume that they intend to eventually invade the whole country . 
  standard finnish was developed to be a mixture of many different dialects . 
  we use the word `` vittu '' , which means vagina , in the same way . 
  ( what the fuck ? ), 
  ( why the fuck ? ), 
  ( how the fuck should i know ) `` vittumainen '' ( shitty ) `` vittuilla '' ( to taunt or mock someone '' `` voi vittujen kev\u00e4t ja kyrpien takatalvi ! '', 
  ( oh the summer of cunts and the cold spell of cocs ! ), 
  well , they do n't sensor naked people on tv . 
  they do n't pixelate genitalia or breasts . 
  that 's how human bodies look , there 's nothing shameful about it . 
  okay , we 're definitely northern european . 
  there are some similarities though , like the alcohol culture , and also russians behave similar to us in the sense that they do n't smile and act happy all the times like americans . 
  wiccanism is a pretty `` free '' religion in the sense that it does n't really have any dominant sacred books or leaders , and the believers usually choose themselves what gods they believe them and how they worship them . 
  the only common rule in wiccanism seems to be : `` as long as you do n't harm anybody , do as you want '' . 
  many wiccans also believe in karmic law and they tend to consider nature sacred . 
  it 's very different from satanism in pretty much every way . 
  if i 've understood correctly , wiccans do n't even believe in satan . 
  you 're right . 
  and the best part is that the neo-nazis are probably also being funded by the kreml . 
  so not only are they in bed with swedish neo-nazis , they 're also kissing putin 's arse !, 
  i think it 's because their group is part of a swedish led neo-nazi organization . 
  they want a unified nordic state . 
  yeah , our neo-nazis like to talk about independence , but they 're actually imperialists . 
  i meant that it might be the reason why the us has good roads . 
  i think that climate affects this stuff a lot . 
  it 's hard to have good roads when ice breaks them every year . 
  in tampere , finland you can visit the house where lenin and stalin first met each other . 
  there 's a [ lenin museum ] ( https://visittampere.fi/article/lenin-museum ) in the house now , it 's the only permanent lenin museum in the world . 
  also , many of the neopagans seem to be doing it mostly because they like traditions and mythology , not because they truly believe in it . 
  many of them make handicrafts , dance folk dances etc. 
  there 's a belief that if you go roll around naked in a field on midsummer night , you 'll see your future husband in your dreams . 
  i 've always wanted to try that . 
  here we have a neo-nazi gang that calls itself `` soldiers of odin '' . 
  the idiots fucking named themselves after a swedish god !, 
  well there are some wiccans , and some [ finnish neopagans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_neopaganism ) .
