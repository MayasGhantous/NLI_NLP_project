  yeah , i never thought the ussr period could be considered a loss of independence for russia . 
  technically , blasphemy is a crime , thought the law is rarely enforced . 
  i think that it 's a very stupid law , and that we should get rid of it , but it 's complicated . 
  some people think that banning blasphemy is good for the freedom of religion . 
  has n't russia always been independent ? 
  also supported pinochet 's coup d'etat in chile . 
  i think people may cheer for norway or estonia , an mayyyyybe for sweden too . 
  not for russia , though . 
  what do you mean ? 
  or kortsukreemi ( anti age cream ) = / = kortsukreemi ( condom lube ) . 
  geographically we are between sweden and the most likely bullets , though . 
  we have some pretty insane competitions , like the [ wife carrying competition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pregc2pcriy ) , the [ swamp football competition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzwznlreubc ) , the [ summer ice fishing competition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-ltpdhzlg4 ) and the [ mobile phone throwing competition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg9nzcjl020 ) , just to name a few . 
  we do it too . 
  eat it outside !, 
  i think that the reason bonfires are burned on midsummer is that if you party all night outside , it often gets too cold , so the bonfire helps with that . 
  yes , but i 'd say that for example , for the baltic countries the soviet occupation is probably the biggest source of hatred and suspicion . 
  `` if you poke the bear , do n't complain if you get bitten . '', 
  independent countries can do whatever they like within they borders . 
  if ukraine wants to join nato , tat 's none of russia 's concern . 
  i think some of it might also be because of history . 
  many people who grew up in the east block or in the soviet union , are a bit suspicious of russia . 
  well , these gangs are often called [ russian mafia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_mafia ) . 
  but it 's true that it 's much more disconnected and less organized than the sicilian one . 
  i 've bought spices from one of the middle eastern shops . 
  no , but you said that finnish is n't a european language , even though it 's spoken in europe . 
  where do you think indo-european languages originate from ? 
  there was somme talk about turkey joining , but erdogan pretty much ruined that . 
  yes , of course , i know that there are some health problem which require it , and that 's an exception . 
  but i 'm opposed to doing unnecessary surgery on healthy infants in the name of tradition or religion . 
  yeah . 
  but there have still been quite a lot of incidents where a cop has completely misinterpreted the situation , and shot someone who was completely harmless . 
  i think they should educate the police officers better , for everyone 's safety . 
  it sometimes seems that way , since there are so many news about cops shooting people in the us , while here they almost never kill anyone . 
  here it is . 
  i do n't really care , both look like dicks . 
  i 'm against the practice of circumcision , though . 
  i think it should be illegal , even for jews and muslims . 
  mutilating a baby 's genitals for religion is just wrong . 
  beware of pickpockets and scammers , they often target tourists . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://travelscams.org/europe/common-tourist-scams-france/ ) a good list of popular tourist scams in france , it applies to some other countries too . 
  is n't pretty much all of us like that ? 
  go to a good public sauna , local people can tell you where to find one . 
  preferably choose a sauna with access to the sea or a lake . 
  you filthy heretic !, 
  climate change . 
  i mean , we 'll probably all die in some catastrophy pretty soon . 
  basically everything written in the [ universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) . 
  i recently learned in school that the double meaning for `` eggs '' can be found in many finno-ugric languages . 
  it that the connection between the word `` egg '' and the male reproductive organs is very old . 
  it kinda makes sense considering that eggs are a common symbol of fertility in many cultures . 
  `` let 's go get varnish from the harbor once it stops raining '', 
  what ? 
  yeah . 
  i ca n't imagine them being smart or devious enough to pull off any bigger conspiracy . 
  in finnish : ** january - tammikuu ** `` oak month '' . 
  in this case `` oak '' means axis or pole , as this month is the midpoint of winter . 
  * kuu * is the finnish word for both `` moon '' and `` month '' . 
  when the temperature drops fast after a warmer period , small ice pearls form on the branches of trees . 
  ** march - maaliskuu ** * maalis * derives from the word * maa * , which means `` earth '' or `` soil '' . 
  in this month the snow often melts a bit , and you can glimpse the soil underneath . 
  ** april - huhtikuu ** * huhta * is an old word for slash-and-burn agriculture , an ancient farming practice where you cut down a forest and burn the trees to create fertile farmland . 
  in this month , the trees were cut down . 
  ** may - toukokuu ** the word * touko * refers to the work done in this month . 
  typically farmers would sow the seeds in may . 
  ** june - kes\u00e4kuu ** literally : `` summer month '' . 
  but originally the name of the month referred to fallow ( * kesanto * ) . 
  in this month the field which had been lying in fallow , was plowed . 
  ** july - hein\u00e4kuu ** `` hay month '' . 
  the month of making hay . 
  ** august - elokuu ** * elo * refers to * elonkorjuu * , which means harvest . 
  ** september - syyskuu ** `` autumn month '' . 
  ** october - lokakuu ** `` slush month '' ** november - marraskuu ** * marras * is an old word for death or dead things , so `` death month '' or `` dead month '' . 
  ** december - joulukuu ** `` christmas month '' . 
  edit : some grammar stuff, 
  mother asked little kalle to go buy some ingredients for lunch . 
  kalle drove to the grocery store on his bike and bought everything his mother needed . 
  as he was driving back home , he fell . 
  an old lady asked : `` are you okay ? '', 
  the boy answered : `` i 'm fine , except that the cucumber snapped , the liver fell apart and the eggs broke . 
  in finnish it 's funny because the finnish word for cucumber , `` kurkku '' , also means throat , and `` eggs '' is a commonly used euphemism for testicles . 
  so what the kid is saying is : `` i 'm fine , except that my throat snapped , my liver fell apart and my balls broke '' :, 
  i saw tanks once at a parade when i was a child . 
  do something about your prisons , they 're inhumane . 
  stop using long term solitary confinement . 
  and reduce the prisons sentences , especially for minor crimes like possession . 
  edit : a word, 
  i accidentally answered the vaping thread , but i 'll answer her too : no your not overreacting , it 's obviously racists as shit to not accept someone into a group because of their nationality . 
  - moomins - tintin - asterix - astrid lindgren 's books - roald dahl 's books - narnia - harry potter - anne of greengables - little women - grimm 's fairytales - h.s.

  swedes are our brothers . 
  we show our love towards them by making fun of them . 
  sadly , no . 
  it was just a spelling mistake . 
  in finland , it 's done on palm sunday . 
  the willow branches represent the palm leaves that people put on the road when jesus rode on his monkey to jerusalem . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.kainuunsanomat.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/03/14637327-1024x684.jpg ) is what they look like . 
  the rhyme is a blessing/spell that 's supposed to keep the person healthy for the rest of the year . 
  it translates to : '' * virvon varvon * , into fresh and healthy , for the coming year , the branch to you , the payment to me '' . 
  the willow branch blessing thing is an eastern tradition , while dressing up as witches comes from sweden . 
  these things were originally done to protect people from witches and evil spirits , which were thought to roam freon holy saturday .
