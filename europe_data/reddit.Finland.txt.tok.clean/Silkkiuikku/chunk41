  was the finnish orange soda jaffa ? 
  we still have two statues of lenin , one in turku and one in kotka . 
  both were given as gifts from different soviet cities . 
  i guess no one cares enough about them to remove them . 
  in finnish the word word for `` egg '' is used for penis . 
  in plural it refers to testicles . 
  this double-meaning is apparently very old . 
  well , the finnish bird for [ barn swallow ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/hirundorusticaflight.jpg ) is `` haarap\u00e4\u00e4sky '' . 
  haara means `` fork '' as in `` fork in the road '' and it describes the bird 's appearance . 
  but the fun part is that haara also means crotch . 
  so it 's the `` crotch swallow '' . 
  we also have isohaarahaukka , the `` big crotch hawk '' . 
  and the finnish word for [ northern lapwing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/northern-lapwing-vanellus-vanellus.jpg/1024px-northern-lapwing-vanellus-vanellus.jpg ) is `` t\u00f6yht\u00f6hyypp\u00e4 '' , which means `` weirdo with a tuft '', 
  [ greenland ] ( https://www.theflagshop.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/465x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/g/r/greenland-flag-std_1.jpg ), 
  i wish everyone would think like you . 
  helsinki , obviously . 
  i would ' t say that estonia is '' without a great international pressure '' compared to the us . 
  i mean , when was the last time someone invaded the us ? 
  sweden : a bit too polite and politically correct . 
  slightly snobbish russia : an annoying tendency to try to affect our politics through threats . 
  shit , sorry , i read it as `` i 'm ** not ** open to not having an infant son circumcised '' . 
  very common , something like half of the population is overweight . 
  so you 'll have plastic surgery performed on your child 's genitalia because you think it looks gross ? 
  what the fucking fuck ? 
  i personally think its wrong to perform plastic surgery on a baby 's genitals because of religion . 
  '' ` murica is the best country in the world and we 're best at everything '' basically just a nice , meaningless phrase for bragging . 
  turkey would make so many enemies . 
  eu member countries would be seriously pissed off . 
  the netherlands is part of nato , so turkey would be pissing off the us . 
  also , to get anywhere close to the netherlands , turkey would have to violate the airspace of a bunch of countries and would need get any tanks there . 
  `` you should slice it with a cheese slicer , not with a lawn mower '' :-d, 
  in a big supermarket we have maybe three different kinds of peanut butter , nutella and some cheap knock-off version of nutella . 
  then there 'd be lots of different type so honey ( liquid and solid , different flowers etc. ) . 
  then there 'd be different types of apple , strawberry , lingonberry , raspberry , cloudberry and bilberry jam . 
  i 've seen lemon curd and fig jam too . 
  i 'm not sure whether you 're trolling , that 's such a weird question . 
  yeah , but i 've never , ever heard a woman say that their boyfriend/husband is of a different race , or that she 's in an interracial marriage . 
  how would you even say that in finnish ? 
  `` mun aviomies on erirotuinen . 
  that sounds like you 're talking about your dog or something . 
  well , the finnish word for sandwich is `` voileip\u00e4 '' which literally means `` butter-bread '' . 
  it 's a bit weird to have a butter bread without butter . 
  you do realize that all european countries have been capitalist ofr a few decades already ? 
  in finnish the word for `` mixed-race '' would be `` sekarotuinen '' , which literally means `` mongrel '' . 
  it 's not a word you 'd use to describe a human being . 
  first we had swedish kings , then we had russian tsars , and then we became independent . 
  in finland there is a bog spring called lev\u00e4nluhta , where almost a hundred skeletons have been found . 
  according to folk stories , bones have been rising up to the surface of the spring every now and then for a long time . 
  the bones date back from the 300s to the 700s . 
  no one knows if they 're human sacrifices , or if it was just a burial site .

  [ bones ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/lev\u00e4luhta_bog,_merovingian_age_bones_-_national_museum_of_finland_-_dsc04176.jpg ), 
  i find the [ huldremose woman ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/69/06/3c690649cc58796c90b6ca38266700c5.jpg ) interesting because she was wearing relatively well preserved [ clothes ] ( http://en.natmus.dk/typo3temp/gb/67731b3166.jpg ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.natmus.dk/typo3temp/gb/9282d77225.jpg ) is the color her clothes would have been originally . 
  she lived in the iron age , around 375 - 175 bce . 
  the last thing in the book was the creation of the eu . 
  but in the lessons we also talked about current topics , like isis , and the annexation of crimea . 
  i think it 's generally agreed upon that the u.s healthcare system is one huge clusterfuck and definitely not something we want to copy . 
  an invading army would never get anywhere close to america . 
  the us would just nuke us long before that . 
  we neither . 
  and i think the french do n't either . 
  here , no one would ever say that they 're in an interracial relationship . 
  it 's very old fashioned and racist to talk about different human races . 
  only neo-nazis pretend that there are different races of humans . 
  people would say that their spouse is from a different country , that they 're russian , or congolese , or chilean , or chinese . 
  no one would walk around saying that their spouse is of a different race , unless they 're a martian or something . 
  yeah , but at least we 're talking about an important topic . 
  it 's a neo-nazi group that wants to unite all scandinavian countries into a national socialist dystopia . 
  no offense , but in my opinion privatizing the prison system was a really shitty idea . 
  i mean , capitalism is the best system and yada yada , but some things really should n't be treated like business . 
  prison should be about ringing justice to victims of crime by punishing the perpetrators , as well as rehabilitating criminals . 
  it really should n't be about making profit . 
  in the american prison system , the prison owners profit from many people receiving long sentences from minor offenses . 
  it 's also not in the best interests of the prison owners to rehabilitate those prisoners , as they 'll earn more money if each inmate commits a crime after being released and returns to prison . 
  yeah , to me americans do n't seem very individualistic when it comes to politics . 
  they 're very loyal to their party no matter what it does , they 're obsessed with skin color and ethnic group , some americans always talk about how their country is the best , many belong to tight-know religious groups etc. 
  the other side of hope by aki kaurism\u00e4ki . 
  it 's absolutely hilarious if you have a slightly weird sense of humor , and very touching and sad too . 
  i 've never heard that . 
  quite the contrary , i think . 
  the stereotype is that the us has very harsh drug laws , and americans give extremely long prison sentences for possession . 
  and `` init '' ? 
  i know the feeling . 
  why do all my beloved countrymen spend their holidays getting shitfaced in tallinn ? 
  i only found out recently while browsing reddit that morris dancing is a thing . 
  i 'd only encountered it in the discworld series and thought terry pratchett made the dance up for his books . 
  i guess that for centuries the church had lots of power , and people were very religious . 
  non-christian and heretics , were persecuted , and jews were no exception . 
  they were considered sinners and bad people . 
  people thought that god would cause all kinds of plagues and catastrophes to punish them , so sinners were dangerous . 
  also , jews were n't allowed to own land or work in many trades , so they are often money-lenders , which was seen as a dishonorable job . 
  many money-lending jews became rich . 
  and then people were envious . 
  and the jews often survived different epidemics better than everyone else , because they were very careful about hygiene . 
  this lead to people suspecting them for causing the epidemics . 
  in many places people believed that the black death was caused by jews poisoning the wells . 
  great food , cool history , beautiful people . 
  i 've never heard of them pickpocketing here , though , only in big european cities with lots of tourists . 
  according to wikipedia it was tomi keskinen , who died on 17.6.2016 .
