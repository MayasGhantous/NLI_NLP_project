  he was one of four police officers who were trying to arrest jorma nyfors . 
  nyfors was inside his house with his wife . 
  he had been reported for shooting at a tractor that his relative was driving , with an an assault rifle . 
  the police surrounded the house and repeatedly told him to come out . 
  eventually they opened the door . 
  nyfors opened fire and wounded one police officer , who retreated to safety . 
  keskinen tried to get to his wounded colleague , but was shot in the back by nyfors , and died instantly . 
  nyfors later shot himself . 
  police officers dying while on duty is extremely rare in finland . 
  the previous one before keskinen was gudmund lidstr\u00f6m who died in 2007 , and the one before him was antero palo in 1997 . 
  so only two finnish police officers have died at work in the 21 century . 
  [ here ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_suomessa_itsen\u00e4isyyden_aikana_virkateht\u00e4viss\u00e4_kuolleista_poliiseista ) is a complete list of all police officers who have died while on duty since the independence . 
  we once had a president called svinhufvud , which is swedish for `` pig 's head '' . 
  the finnish roma have been here for centuries and are quite well integrated . 
  they send their children to school , live in the same areas as everyone else ( no ghettos ) , and most of them have jobs . 
  many of them also wear their traditional [ dress ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1199,h_800,q_70/13-3-9312069.jpg ) , which is unique to finnish roma . 
  they can all speak finnish , some of them also speak a local version of the roma language . 
  they have their own customs and traditions , and there are given and family names that are typical to them . 
  they 're typically very religious and many of them belong to the pentecostal or baptist churches . 
  people are pretty prejudiced towards them . 
  many people think that roma commit more crimes , especially theft , than the general population . 
  i ca n't find any evidence for or against this belief , as there is no data collected on crimes committed by roma . 
  then there are [ some roma ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/347892/landscape16_9/1024/576/f1c9149fe5fba6e2a97a882d79ec95af/ij/1375557.jpg ) who have come from eastern european countries to beg . 
  they do n't speak finnish , they dress differently and they mostly beg on the street . 
  people are advised to not to give them money , because they 're usually brought here by an organized crime ring . 
  some mob boss is profiting from the money these people earn by begging . 
  people have a very negative attitude towards them , but they 're mostly harmless . 
  they come here because the conditions in their countries are shitty and they 're systematically discriminated against there . 
  in many places in eastern europe the roma live in ghettos and their children do n't go to school . 
  nazi jokes are great . 
  we all joke about things that scare us . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the soundtrack for my country you mean ? 
  it ' probably be the military march [ porilaisten marssi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw4xuop8ez4 ) because it 's awesome . 
  no one ever sings it though , because the lyrics are absolutely horrifying and filled with blood and gore . 
  but the melody is oddly upbeat . 
  i do n't think anyone fears russia conquering the world so much as russia conquering another country . 
  none of us want to be the next people who the kreml decides to take protective measures against . 
   also , what are the reasons for reintroduction ? 
  it ca n't be good . 
  i 'm pretty sure that your country 's recent actions in ukraine the reason . 
  also , a military coup is pretty unlikely when the army consists of normal people . 
  i do n't think anyone knows anything about bosnians or albanians . 
  there is a tiny tatar minority here , though . 
  they 've been here since the russian times and i 've never heard anyone say a bad word about them . 
  well , most people here speak english somewhat well , but you 'll always be considered a foreigner here if you do n't learn finnish . 
  what a funny coincidence , we 've always planned our defence for attacks from the east too !, 
  politics are n't a funny tv show and should n't be treated like one . 
  are you saying that you made an incompetent lying populist one of the most powerful people of the world because you see politics as a * hearty competition * ? 
  so you thought that trying to destroy your own government by electing a `` human molotov cocktail '' was somehow a good idea ? 
  same that i 've thought the whole time : he 's an unscrupulous , lying populist and dangerously incompetent for his job . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's greek or turkish , but it 's fantastic . 
  fuck no . 
  yes , it 's `` jenkit '' in finnish . 
  some people also call america `` jenkkil\u00e4 '' . 
  it does n't really have a negative connotation or anything . 
  we have a popular chewing gum brand called `` jenkki '' . 
  what ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that our nationalists , while they hate many people , do n't hate eastern europeans . 
  some of them do n't like russia very much , but even they seem to be fine with other eastern european countries . 
   is there a violent anti-american sentiment where you are ? 
  only if you consider trump jokes violent, 
  18 years old , but of course no one cares . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  `` leader of the free world '' sounds like something out of an orwellian dystopy . 
  it was the language in all the movies . 
  it sounded cool because all the heroes and villains on the screen spoke it . 
  i learned most of my english from harry potter , lord of the rings , and the simpsons . 
  milk . 
  that 's pretty ironic considering that those are definitely `` government controlled tv news '' . 
  they 're propaganda written by the kreml . 
  i ca n't think of a good way to address it . 
  if putin wants to spread lies about us and indoctrinate his people to see us as a bunch of evil fascist , then there 's nothing we can do about it . 
  but we should n't just ignore what russian media writes about us , since it 's a good indicator of their attitudes towards us . 
  i understand what you mean , but i think that the public opinion does matter . 
  for example , russian state controlled newspapers have a habit of writing articles about what horrible fascists we are . 
  often these articles have very little to do with facts . 
  they 've been doing this with many of their neighboring countries ever since the ukraine conflict started . 
  for some reason the kreml wishes to manipulate the public opinion in russia to be against us . 
  `` you sound like you 're about to fall asleep '', 
  i dunno , i think we give great deal of crap about what bigger and more powerful countries think of us . 
  trying to stay on peaceful terms with superpowers is just common sense . 
  i 've never heard of it . 
  what are you , anarchists ? 
  yes . 
  home . 
  this has indeed been asked before . 
  you may not get many answers because i 'm pretty sure that every single swede here have answered to this question a few times already . 
  it might be a good idea to search some old discussions here .

  you have to be 18 years old to buy or use a [ sparkler ] ( http://www.feigonhamilton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sparkleropener1.jpg ) . 
  safari and google, 
  i 've never heard of this . 
  how can you hate a nationality ? 
  that 's just racist , and illogical . 
  if you do n't know every single person from a country personally , then you ca n't hate them . 
  except swedes of course , they * all * suck / s, 
  yeah . 
  our racists pretty much ruined that word . 
  fuck racists they ruin everything .
