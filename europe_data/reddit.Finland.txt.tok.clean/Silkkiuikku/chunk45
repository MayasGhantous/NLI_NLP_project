  i think that it 's scary , scary cult that has committed many crimes . 
  it is shameful that us government does n't seem to be able to indict them for wha they have done . 
  seriously , they 've harassed , stalked , abused and straight up murdered their followers and people investigating them . 
  what ? 
  why do you hate scandinavian airlines so much ? 
  no one 's oppressing them . 
  reddit can remove whatever it wants , it 's a private enterprise . 
  reddit is an enterprise . 
  it does n't have to offer a platform for any political group . 
  it 's not censorship , it 's business . 
  i can understand very well why reddit would n't wish to be associated with such groups . 
  what colonization by swedes ? 
  you know , ukraine considered joining nato , and russia did n't react very well . 
  no one knows for sure what would happen if we tried to join . 
  it 's middle east . 
  like `` oriental rugs '' which are persian . 
  it 's so weird how some americans seem to think that calling someone `` black '' is racist and use `` african-american '' instead . 
  using the term african-american as a synonym for black just does n't work . 
  today , there are white africans . 
  there are black europeans . 
  there are aboriginal australians . 
  i do n't get irritated , i just think that it 's bullshit . 
  it 's not about genes . 
  the way i see it , blood does n't matter , skin color does n't matter , and where your great-great-great-grandfather was born does n't matter either . 
  what matters is if you know my culture , if you 're a part of it . 
  so some random american with one-tenth finnish genes may or may not be finnish . 
  where your family comes from is irrelevant . 
  if you identify as finnish and if you know the culture , then i do n't care if your parents were born in moscow , mogadishu or marrakesh , you 're finnish . 
  but some yankee who does n't know shit about finland , is n't . 
  the finnish anthem has 11 stanzas , but only the first one and the last one are usually sung . 
  some of the other stanzas are really pessimistic . 
  the second stanza begins with : `` this country is poor and so it will stay '' . 
  yeah , you guys have the best anthem after the french one . 
  the melody is great . 
  yeah , everyone knows it somewhat well . 
  you have to sing it in school on independence day . 
  yeah , lenin just looks really nice in comparison to stalin , but so does almost anyone . 
  at least in finland people like to joke about some areas being slums , but it just means that there are lots of really ugly apartment blocks and drunk people lying around . 
  in some areas there are more fights and such than in some other areas , but i do n't think anywhere is particularly dangerous . 
  the buildings can really assault your eyes though . 
  they look like something out of a post-apocalyptic soviet union . 
  seriously , this is the kind of high quality finnish design houses i 'm talking about : http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/628/de26dbdbeb404692b60436ab86fc383b.jpg https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yocs-g6v8ec/v1j9ctahcci/aaaaaaaabms/vzpcvb6yzx86biskqrbn4d7t-1lko_m1wclcb/s1600/tammela%2bv%25c3%25a4in%25c3%25b62.jpg http://www.sci.fi/~olvari/jeje/wood.jpg, 
  there is an extremely famous meme of a syrian wedding singer . 
  to a finnish person it sounds like he 's singing something like : `` the geese of the nile bite me in the ass , they binge on whiskey , oh my screwdriver uncle '' . 
  for added effect there are misheard finnish `` subtitles '' . 
  now is better than anytime in the past , but we did have a bit of a golden era in art from 1880 to 1910 . 
  a lot of artist wanted to help build a finnish cultural identity and did a lot of awesome stuff in the process . 
  a lot of the most revered finnish artists are from that period and many of their paintings have reached an iconic status here . 
  here are some of the most famous paintings : akseli gallen-kallela : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/gallen_kallela_lemminkainens_mother.jpg eero j\u00e4rnefelt : https://flockler.com/thumbs/10112/raatajat_rahanalaiset_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg pekka halonen : http://www.alternativefinland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pekka-halonen-talvinen-iltarusko-1899.jpg albert edelfelt : http://www.ateneum.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/edelfelt_albert_lapsen_ruumissaatto-1180x687.jpg helene schjerfbeck https://peda.net/huittinen/perusopetus/pellonpuiston-koulu/oppiaineet2/kuvataide/7-lk/hso/omakuva-1915:file/download/23b72c8d31c7d4e7a111f3694677f0ccf1c15127/80c5674b-1162-4034-977d-99327f540585.jpeg, 
  the part west of the ural mountains is in europe , the part east of the ural is asian . 
  so the same as the map . 
  well prostitutes were probably pretty cheap . 
  i mean , he probably had to pay his models to sit still for hours and i imagine he did n't want to pay very much . 
  also , i recall reading somewhere that posing for a painter for money was seen as immodest and chaste `` proper '' women did n't want to do it . 
  it 's also illegal to fly a flag on non-holidays , and even on holidays it 's illegal to fly a flag before eight am or after sundown or 21 pm . 
  except for midsummer eve , then you fly the flag from 18pm to 21pm the next day . 
  yeah , our laws seem to take this shit awfully seriously . 
  `` how is this not brought up by the media '' uh , you seriously think that our media ignores our huge-ass neighboring country invading a part of another country ? 
  trust me , we find it all very interesting . 
  probably whoever the artist thought was good-looking enough . 
  no , it 's illegal to publicly destroy a flag publicly and you 'll be fined . 
  i 'm also pretty sure that burning something at a protest would be illegal for safety reasons . 
  quite . 
  i mean , they actually voted trump . 
  i honestly never believed that he 's become president considering all the horrible shit he has said . 
  the man has redeeming qualities whatsoever , and if people vote for him , well something must be wrong . 
  red bead necklaces . 
  they 're ugly and they block the sun . 
  it 's dark enough here as it is . 
  yeah . 
  if bears want to kill a human , they can do it with little effort . 
  they run and climb much faster than us and they can kill a person with one bite to the neck or a blow to the head . 
  luckily they do n't really see us as prey and only attack humans when they feel threatened , like when they have cubs , or are guarding a fresh kill . 
  i mean , it happens , but rarely . 
  i know many , many people who 've encountered moose on a close distance without any problem . 
  but females with calves or rutting males can be dangerous since they 're huge , biggest males weigh over 700 kilos . 
  it 's very rare for them to attack people unprovoked . 
  the real danger us crashing into them while driving . 
  yeah , the quality in zara clothes worse than h&m . they seem to break very quickly . 
  not more than what is normal for anyone who living in a country that shares a border with russia . 
  yes and i think so . 
  if you 're lucky enough to have one . 
  saudi arabia and north korea . 
  according to the political compass i 'm a left-libertarian . 
  the dish draining closet . 
  we never have to dry the dishes with a towel , we just put them there : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dish_draining_closet, 
  there are some fancy swedish , german and russian names of noble families and the stereotype is that anyone with that kind of a name is super rich and snobby . 
  here 's a list of finnish noble families : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_finnish_noble_families, 
  well i 'm biased , but i like several of ours : western finnish dresses : uskela region : http://www.kansallispuvut.fi/puvut/img/uskela_np.jpg virolahti region : http://www.kansallispuku.com/image/perhe/_mg_9960.jpg kokkola region : https://kansallispuvussa.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/k_kokkola.jpg?w=552&amp;h=735&amp;crop=1 karelian dresses : antrea region : https://www.karjalanliitto.fi/files/4438/640/antrean_puku_290912_kuva_spelvas.jpg kivennapa region : http://www.kansallispuku.com/image/jaaski_ja_kivennapa/kivennapa_talvi.jpg?165759 sakkola-rautu region : http://seurasaarenkansantanssijat.fi/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sakkola_johannes.jpg _____________________________________________________ but the norwegian ones are the most beautiful ones : http://img2.custompublish.com/getfile.php/1945076.732.saepysbuuf/\u00d8st-telemark%26nbsp%3b1.jpg http://img2.custompublish.com/getfile.php/1945051.732.baqyfvxvxp/beltestakk%26nbsp%3bgammel.jpg http://www.custompublish.com/getfile.php/1945077.732.swfervcsxe/\u00d8st-telemark%26nbsp%3bbrud%26nbsp%3b2.jpg?force=1 https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d5/41/08/d5410861727f905e5e78c69a7bbb4f17.jpg, 
  no , my teachers were all finns . 
  i 'd say the great famine of 1695 -- 1697 . 
  there was no summer so all the crops died , and in two years a fourth or a third of the population died . 
  of course , why would anyone disagree ? 
  there is n't really an eu community . 
  you should try to integrate to hungary . 
  the season . 
  paska = shit vittu = cunt perse = ass voi vittujen kev\u00e4t = the spring of cunts jumalauta = god help or god board perkele = the devil or an ancient pagan thunder god saatana = satan helvetti = hell, 
  uralic languages is a surprisingly big language group , as it encompasses all the finno-ugric and and samoyedic languages from hungarian to nenets and from western sami to selkup . 
  which language or dialect do you speak ? 
  what 's the longest word you know ?
