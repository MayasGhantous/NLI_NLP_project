  very differently i 'd imagine . 
  it seems that the american soldiers mostly treated the civilians humanly , though there were quite a lot of crimes against civilian women and girls . 
  the red army however was much worse , as they practically used berlin as their personal brothel . 
  uh , you do n't see why moving into a country where you do n't speak the language might be a bit difficult ? 
  when did you go to school ? 
  i 'm in high school and here they mention it nowadays . 
  the siege of leningrad aka that really bad thing we did during the continuation war curiously , the english wikipedia claims that `` almost all historians regard the siege as a german operation and do not consider that the finns effectively participated in the siege . '', 
  while the finnish wikipedia says that : `` the traditional view in both finnish and foreign history writing has been that finland did not actively participate in the siege of leningrad even though the finnish forces formed a siege ring around lake ladoga and the gulf of finland . 
  pekka visuri , a docent of the national defence university called this sentiment a national myth '' so the english wikipedia actually seems nicer towards finnish history than the finnish one . 
  but the english wikipedia also quotes the russian historian nikolai baryshnikov as a credible source , while the finnish wikipedia simply says that : nikolai baryshnikov holds this opposing view , but he has also treated the winter war as the soviet unions defense war against finnish aggression ( in finnish this means : do n't trust this guy , he 's full of bullshit ), 
  stem down then use the peel as handle , of course . 
  i 'm not a weird heretic freak . 
  irish europeans ? 
  are there non-european irish people too ? 
  in finnish people use `` romani '' in official context probably because the finnish word gypsy , `` mustalainen '' sounds a bit funny , as `` musta '' means black and it 's kinda like talking about `` blackies '' or `` the black ones '' . 
  depends on how racist the people you hang out with are . 
  what the fuck is that ? 
  tuesday fat ? 
  `` do n't be a shit country and we would n't have to do that stuff '' way to blame the victim . 
  yes , because then no one would make another season of black mirror , or orange is the new black , or narcos , or orphan black , or better call saul and then what would i do with my life ? 
  yeah , we know that a lot of americans hate trump and that there are practically only two political parties , ad that it 's very divided . 
  but saying that `` most americans hate trump '' is a bit weird considering that he just won the goddamn presidential election . 
  why are you guys down voting this comment ? 
  he 's obviously being sarcastic . 
  no , you stupid swedes make the cinnamon buns all wrong . 
  you do n't even put any cardamom in them !, 
  in finnish it 's : `` kruuna vai klaava '' . 
  the word kruuna comes from the swedish `` krona '' which means `` crown '' , as during the swedish reign there was a picture of three crowns on one side of the coin . 
  no one seems to be sure why the side with the number is called `` klaava '' , or what klaava means . 
  no , that 's gross . 
  nahkurin orsilla tavataan = see you on the tanner 's racks = we 're screwed ( this one come 's from a popular war novel ), 
  and it literally translates to : `` do you want ( something ) on your muzzle ? '', 
  juosten kustu = pissed while running = work that has been done in a hastily juosta p\u00e4\u00e4 kolmantena jalkana = to run with one 's head as a third foot = to run really fast ei ole kaikki muumit laaksossa = ( he ) does n't have all the moomins in the valley = he 's crazy nousta kusi p\u00e4\u00e4h\u00e4n = to have piss rise up in one 's head = to become arrogant vied\u00e4 saunan taakse = to take someone behind the sauna = to beat up/kill someone potkaista tyhj\u00e4\u00e4 = to kick empty space = to die ( because people who are hanged kick the air ), 
  i think it should be mandatory for both men and women . 
  in israel it 's mandatory for both sexes and apparently women are just as capable at shooting people as men . 
  probably because it implies that blood and genes are more important than actually being integrated in a society . 
  it 's kinda weird how some americans think that for example , if their great-great-grandfather was french , that somehow makes then french . 
  it 's kinda offensive , as it implies that some random ` murican who does n't know shit about french culture is a real frenchman because they have french ancestry , while a child of moroccan immigrants who has lived their whole life in france , is not . 
  i just do n't agree with the american definition of nationality . 
  i think that it 's your cultural background that matters , not your genes . 
  if you have finnish citizenship and are sorta integrated ( speak finnish , know the culture ) then i do n't care if your parents were born in bagdad or mogadishu , you 're finnish in my books . 
  that 's what really matters , not genetics . 
  i do n't know about teutons , only that what is now southern finland , became a part of the swedish kingdom and finns became catholics like the swedes . 
  they taught us both about the crusades to jerusalem and the crusades to finland . 
  the perception of the swedish crusades to finland is quite neutral , or even positive , as it made the unorganized tribes living in finland subjects of the swedish king and made finns part of the european cultural sphere . 
  in the 1100s and 1200 swedish kings sent soldiers to do crusades and convert the pagan finns . 
  the swedes wanted to gain control of the finns before the novgorodians did . 
  it was mostly peaceful and slowly finns converted to christianity and became subjects of the swedish king and the swedish bishop . 
  the perception of the crusades to jerusalem is pretty negative . 
  there was a lot of looting and massacres . 
  i like ours , it 's inspired by the nature . 
  there 's a song about the flag called sininen ja valkoinen ( white and blue ) that goes : sininen on taivas , ( the sky is blue ) siniset on silm\u00e4ns\u00e4 sen ( it has blue eyes ) siniset on j\u00e4rvet , ( the lakes are blue ) sinisyytt\u00e4 heijastaen ( as they reflect the blue ) valkoinen on hanki ( the snow covered ground is white ) valkoiset on y\u00f6t kesien ( the summer nights are white ) valkoiset on pilvet ( the clouds are white ) lampaat nuo taivaan sinisen ( they 're the sheeps of the blue sky ), 
  global warming , obviously . 
  translation : `` tattle-tub bing bong , walks in all yards , licks all bowls '', 
  i 'd hope that they at least name a beer brand after my region . 
  that would be cool . 
  of course . 
  people like me who 've never met a neo-nazi obviously wo n't answer since they have nothing to tell . 
  that 's how these kinds of question work . 
  if you ask `` have you ever been to samoa and what was it like '' the vast majority of the answers will be from people who have been to samoa . 
  the rest wo n't bother answering with a single `` no '' . 
  is n't `` mandelmassa '' almond paste ? 
  there 's one popular poem about migratory birds . 
  you 're supposed to be able to predict when summer comes by the birds you see . 
  kuu kiurusta kes\u00e4\u00e4n ( a month to summer from a lark ) puolikuuta peipposesta ( half a month from a finch ) v\u00e4st\u00e4r\u00e4kist\u00e4 v\u00e4h\u00e4sen ( a little from a wagtail ) p\u00e4\u00e4skysest\u00e4 ei p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4n ( not a day more from a swallow ) as a child the swallow was the only bird i could recognize and i was always very happy when i saw one , as it meant that it was summer . 
  when we jumped with a long skipping rope we used to recite a rhyme about a teddy bear and the girl jumping would have to do all the things that the teddy bear did while jumping . 
  i ca n't remember it completely , but it was something like this : nallekarhu , nallekarhu ( teddy bear , teddy bear ) tule sis\u00e4lle ( come inside ) nosta tassusi , py\u00f6ri ymp\u00e4ri ( lift up your paws , spin around ) niiaa , kumarra ( curtsey , bow ) potkaise , kiljaise , karjaise ( kick , scream , yell ) sy\u00f6 hunajaa , mene humalaan ( eat honey , get drunk ) mene nukkumaan , mene pois !, 
  ( go to bed , go away ! ), 
  ___________________________________________________ then there 's another one which supposedly foretells the way you 'll get married . 
  first you jump while the other girls recite the alphabet to find out the first letter of your groom 's name . 
  for example , if you mess up when they 're saying `` e '' , then your grooms name begins with an e . then you jump again to see what you 'll be wearing on your wedding day , and the others recite : `` h\u00e4\u00e4puku , juhlapuku , uikkarit , alasti '' ( wedding dress , party dress , swimsuit , naked ) then you find out where the wedding ceremony will take place : `` kirkko , koti , vessa , roskis '' ( church , home , toilet , trash can ) ____________________________________________________________________________ edit : i just remembered another rope jumping poem . 
  ensimm\u00e4inen enkeli , toinen tonkeli ( first one an angel , second one a tonkeli ( ? ) ), 
  kolmas kovanokka , nelj\u00e4s neulasilm\u00e4 ( third one a hard beak , fourth one a needle-eye ) viides villahousu , kuudes kullanuppu ( fifth one woollen pants , sixth one a bud of gold ) seitsem\u00e4s sep\u00e4nem\u00e4nt\u00e4 , kahdeksas kanavaras ( seventh one a blacksmith 's wife , eight one a chicken thief ) yhdeks\u00e4s ylioppilas , kymmenes kyyk\u00e4\u00e4rme ( ninth one a graduate , tenth one a viper ), 
  you should probably ask this question in r/askhistorians , they 're pretty good at answering these kinds of questions . 
  why though ? 
  why do you give half a shit about some stupid person mixing you up with someone else ? 
  people also mix up slovakia and slovenia , and latvia and lithuania . 
  it 's not dangerous . 
  i 'm pretty sure that some form of education is mandatory in all european countries , but i think a lot of immigrants watch their home countries tv channels and listen to music from their countries . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that of course , i did the same thing when i lived abroad . 
  personally i consider anyone who has finnish citizenship to be a finn . 
  however , people being prejudiced and all , a person of immigrant descent who looks distinctly different from the majority of the population , might experience racism and distrust which might contribute to radicalization . 
  yes , but it seems possible to me that problems with integration and feelings of marginalization and alienation might contribute to some second or third generation immigrants joining isis , while a native european likely would n't face the same kind of problems . 
  do you mean europeans or europeans of immigrant origin ? 
  because i think that these two groups join isis for different reasons . 
  how would this even work in the americas ? 
  if you threw out all the whites , blacks , mestizos , asians and any mixed-blood people , there would only be a very small amount of people left on the continents . 
  many countries , like haiti , would become practically empty . 
  it 's not my problem if ignorant people do n't know that roma and romanians are different peoples . 
  no , i do n't . 
  driving away people from their homes because of their ethnicity or skin color is generally a really shitty thing to do . 
  maybe they just ca n't speak english well ? 
  roma or romani is considered to be a better word to use in official contexts . 
  gypsy is very vague term , as it can also be used to refer to any traditionally nomadic peoples , like irish travellers . 
  also , gypsy is sometimes used as a slur . 
  freedom of expression , secularism and equality . 
  the reign of charles ( karl ) xii of sweden was n't a huge success . 
  he assumed power at the age of fifteen and during his reign sweden fought a war against russia and denmark called the great northern war . 
  he was n't very successful and finland , which was a province of sweden , was invaded by the russian army . 
  the period of invasion is called the great wrath .
