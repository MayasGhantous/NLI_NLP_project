  yes , they 're all very beautiful . 
  of course i could n't wear any of them since i 'm not sami . 
  i think the skolt sami dress and enonteki\u00f6-kautokeino dress are the most beautiful ones .

  that 's because finnish is a finno-ugric language and not indo-european like french , russian , greek , english , swedish , latvian or most other languages spoken in europe . 
  yeah , i meant the older minorities . 
  according to wikipedia there are 470 000 finnish speakers , between 40 000 and 70 000 me\u00e4nkieli speakers , 9 500 romani speakers , 9000 sami speakers and an estimated 750-1500 yiddish speakers . 
  i would n't call this `` a couple thousand '' . 
  the finnish ones are very rare too . 
  mostly older people wear them on very rare occasions . 
  you only really see them on folk dance groups . 
  thank you . 
  do they work now ? 
  yes , and they also have people who speak romani , yiddish , finnish , and me\u00e4nkieli . 
  you do realize that there are five minority languages with official status in sweden ? 
  or do you think hat finnish , me\u00e4nkieli , romani , sami and yiddish are swedish dialects or something ? 
  there are a lot of places in finland where swedish is the dominant language , though . 
  that looks delicious . 
  - the rye mcfeast , a hamburger with dark rye bread - cheese nuggets with oltermanni cheese - paulig 's coffee - porridge with dried raspberries - porridge with apple and cinnamon can you get milk in other countries ? 
  that necklace thing is gorgeous . 
  greenland , right ? 
  why ? 
  it 's funny , morris dance was mentioned in a discworld novel and for the longest time i thought terry pratchett has made the whole thing up . 
  i love the provence one , very exquisite . 
  yeah , i was surprised when i first drove on a german autobahn . 
  i mean , i knew that there are 17 million dutch people in the world , but i did n't know they were all in german roads . 
  the only way your gigantic population can fit into your tiny country is by having one third of your population in trailers on german autobahns at any given moment . 
  belarus . 
  why is that country so weird ? 
  they still have death penalty and their `` president '' is scary . 
  it 's awesome if someone tries to learn finnish . 
  perplexing , but definitely admirable . 
  also , username checks out . 
  wow , those hats look like crazy wedding cakes . 
  love the colors !, 
  really ? 
  i think these dresses ( from marken , i think ) are very beautiful : https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0a/13/81/0a138122221f2bd801c05d37887fe7f6.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e0/c6/92/e0c692e4bfad80d856dbcc73aebb9feb.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fe/12/00/fe1200192ab2217f28ecb19c60984949.jpg, 
  not dumb , but funny : the catholic church is worried : there are not enough exorcists, 
  apparently in kauniainen , espoo and sipoo . 
  they 're all part of the metropolitan area surrounding helsinki . 
  china ? 
  do you even know where china is ? 
  moon is great . 
  i saw it without knowing what it was about , thinking it would be an exciting sci-fi adventure . 
  it was so sad , one of the saddest movies i 've ever seen . 
  most movies i 've seen are partly , or completely american , but my favorites are : - full metal jacket - fargo - watchmen - doctor strangelove - silence of the lambs, 
  i know that a lot if belgians , frenchmen and germans buy petrol , tobacco products an alcohol product from luxembourg because they 're relatively cheap there . 
  the finnish law says that ( my translation ) : `` anyone who publicly destroys a finnish flag or uses it in an disrespectful manner or removes a publicly displayed finnish flag without permission is to be sentenced to a fine for desecrating the finnish flag . '', 
  this is not the law , but the acceptable way to get rid of a worn out flag is to either cut it into small , unrecognizable pieces and throw into trash , or burn it . 
  so burning a worn out flag is in fact encouraged . 
  in official circumstances people like to speak `` kirjakieli '' ( literally : book language ) . 
  it 's the official finnish in which books and newspapers are written . 
  everyone can speak and write it without thinking , but no one speaks like that in their everyday life . 
  - gingerbreads . 
  the molds come in all shapes too . 
  traditional ones are shaped like men , women , pigs , stars , spruces , reindeer , hearts and flowers : http://www.martat.fi/site/assets/files/4893/piparit_id_14507.jpg - pulla : http://vuodatus-media-1.vuodatus.net/g/11369/1219492.jpg - joulutortut : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wxdimwtql8a/vi3babxhs-i/aaaaaaaabwi/ikrvfqbtj9o/s1600/tortut3.jpg ( a few years ago some swedish newspaper commented that they look like swastikas :-d ) also tons of chocolate . 
  the joke 's that she 's dating putin , right ? 
  i think the funniest joke i 've heard about russia is the darkest one . 
  we 'd read in the paper that boris nemtsov had been assassinated right next to the kreml and naturally none of the cctv : s had caught it . 
  everyone thought that it was kinda funny because it was so outrageous , and my mom jokingly said : `` i 'm sure that tomorrow some chechen is going to confess . '', 
  the next day a chechen confessed . 
  can you tell me one joke ? 
  do any russians joke about putin ? 
  come to think of it , it does n't really work so well in english . 
  in finnish the word for `` sharing '' is also the word for `` deviding '' and `` splitting up '' . 
  i know an old finnish ww2 era joke about this : it was quiet in the trenches and the soldiers of both sider were resting between battles . 
  a russian soldier decided to pick up a megaphone and shout some propaganda . 
  he shouted : `` hey , finnish guys , why do n't you surrender and come here , we have mahorka !, 
  ( russian tobacco ) a finnish soldier answered : `` no , you surrender , we have tobacco ! '', 
  `` no , you surrender , we have communism ! '', 
  shouts the russian . 
  there 's a brief silence and then the disappointed finn shouts : `` oh , then you were probably lying about the mahorka too . '', 
  apparently scientology has tried to gain the status of a registered religion , but failed , as it is considered to be more of a corporation than a religious movement . 
  in 2011 there were 120 people in finland who belonged to the finnish scientology association . 
  vladimir putin logged in on facebook and saw a post about ukraine , and thought : `` i got ta share this ! '', 
  i dunno , in primary and secondary school it is , but after that people seem to realize how much easier it is to make fun of the good old superpowers . 
  i think it 's a tie between america and russia . 
  yes . 
  yeah , i agree that sanders was obviously the best choice . 
  but clinton was still miles better than president pussy-grabber , and sometimes you got ta be pragmatic . 
  he supports torture , brags about sexually harassing women , childishly insults his opponents and goes around saying racist shit about everyone . 
  well , i guess he 's the hero america deserves . 
  people not wanting to vote for clinton even though it was obvious that sanders was n't gon na win . 
  the alternative was fucking trump and people still did n't wan na vote for clinton ? 
  no , and no . 
  everyone here has been talking about joining nato for twenty years or so . 
  i think bush junior and his `` wars on terror '' are a big reason why we have n't . 
  and now there 's trump . 
  i 've never heard that . 
  i mean , i know that ` murica is a nickname for the us , but i 've never heard that sentence and do n't understand what it means . 
  is that even grammatically correct ? 
  a weird nerd who likes to sit alone in a cabin in the forest . 
  he does n't really talk except when he 's drunk . 
  how do you define western europe , though ? 
  is finland in western europe ? 
  what about poland ? 
  there are two different definitions for `` nationalist '' in the oxford dictionary : 1 . 
  a person who advocates political independence for a country : 2 . 
  a person with strong patriotic feelings , especially one who believes in the superiority of their country over others . 
  i can only speak for myself , but here 's what i think : 1 ) well if you 've never been in finland and do n't speak finnish , and neither do your parents ... well no 2 ) depends on whether they consider themselves finnish 3 ) yes , if they consider themselves to be finnish .
