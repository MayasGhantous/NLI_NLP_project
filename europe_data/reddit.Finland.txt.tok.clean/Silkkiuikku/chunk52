  4 ) yes . 
  5 ) of course . 
  6 ) we do n't have any . 
  depends on the church . 
  we also have `` jumalan sel\u00e4n takana '' which means `` behind god 's back '' . 
  managed . 
  they fought two wars in which the goal was to annex finland , but it proved to difficult and expensive . 
  do n't tell that to finns . 
  we 'll all move there . 
  are you seriously saying that learning russian makes a person a russophile ? 
  i mean i 'm no anglophile and here i am , speaking the queens english . 
  are you ? 
  they teach it in schools when they talk about the cold war . 
  in finnish a place in the middle of nowhere is calle `` huitsin nevada '' . 
  i dunno why nevada though . 
  yeah , do n't you get free coffee from grocery stores in the netherlands ? 
  finland was a part of russia for 100 years until the russian revolution in 1917 , after which finland declared independence . 
  the soviet union never managed to occupy finland . 
  i 've only seen them on american tv shows . 
  we have the two word thing `` ole hyv\u00e4 '' . 
  some kids use the anglicism `` pliis '' , it 's a slang word . 
  - glitch - random - mind fuck - butthurt - small talk ( of course we do n't have a word for that :-d ), 
  eti\u00e4inen once meant an apparition of a person , a sort of doppelg\u00e4nger that could be seen at a place shortly before the person himself arrived . 
  the eti\u00e4inen was a sort of a segment of their soul which travelled before them . 
  nowadays people use it to mean a premonition , a feeling that something is going to happen . 
  perkele used to be the name of a thunder god , but when everyone converted to christianism people started to use it to refer to the devil instead . 
  ryss\u00e4 is a swedish loanword which was once a neutral word for `` russian '' . 
  now it 's a slur . 
  - almost one of every hundred coffee beans in the world is imported to finland , a country of only 5,5 million people . 
  we drink a lot of coffee . 
  more than any other country per capita , in fact . 
  - next year finland will have been independent for 100 years . 
  a lot of countries are ruled by dictators and a lot of countries have nuclear weapons . 
  does n't give us the right to attack them . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  boys : vilho , hugo , niilo girls : kerttu , alma, 
  `` we do need to confine terrorists/terrorist suspects '' well why on earth do you think you have the right to imprison suspects who are n't even from the us without trial ? 
  `` i personally think that the iraq war was `` justified '' why was it justified ? 
  because they were supposed to have weapons of mass destruction ? 
  the us has weapons of mass destruction too , you know . 
  `` i think our role as `` world police '' is a necessary evil , to a certain extent . 
  i mean lets be honest , if we did n't do anything to say , help victims of a tsunami or hurricane or stop a dictator '' yes , us intervention is great , just ask afghanistan , iraq or latin american countries like chile . 
  `` be thankful anyone would visit '' oh i am , please come for a visit , my house is missing a wall , if you want you can build it and then you can pay me . 
  yeah , what does he mean , `` talking to random strangers '' ? 
  that 's an alien concept too me . 
  well almost nobody thought it could happen , we thought americans were better than that . 
  apparently we were wrong . 
  - g.w. 
  bush - trump - use of prolonged solitary confinement in prisons - extremely long prison sentences - the fact that one percent of the us population is in prison - capital punishment - abu ghraib - gitmo - iraq war - playing world police in independent countries since ww2 - expensive healthcare - calling you country `` the leader of the free world '' - the pledge of allegiance in schools -31 % of americans do n't believe in the evolution, 
  yes . 
  it 's one of the most un-ecological things you can possibly do . 
  i think people should travel seldom , and try to travel to destinations which they can reach by train . 
  flying is the worst . 
  `` do you do that to any other nation ? '', 
  yes ? 
  seriously do you ever read this sub ? 
  it 's full of europeans teasing and mocking each other . 
  you 'd think that the world 's arguably most powerful country could take a few sarcastic jabs , but i guess not . 
  it 's like a sweet pudding made of rye , it has a very distinct unique and slightly weird taste , but it 's very good with lots of cream and sugar . 
  they 're an unhealthy snack , like candy , not proper food . 
  people eating them for lunch is so strange . 
  i do n't think i 'm brave enough . 
  your traditional cuisine is so weird !, 
  ca n't i something normal , like lye fish , or blood sausage with lingonberries , or black slime called `` m\u00e4mmi '' . 
  no i have n't , i 'm normal . 
  i think it 's the crisps . 
  i 've seen so many people on british tv shows eat crisps for lunch . 
  so strange . 
  yeah , sounds right to me . 
  nice people , shit government . 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  thanks . 
  if he fills the criteria , i. e. is unable or unwilling to return due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on his or her race , religion , nationality , political opinion , or membership in a particular social group . 
  does n't seem very likely . 
  even a lot of syrian 's ca n't get in even though there 's a legitimate war and some famines going on there , because they 're technically not being persecuted . 
  so unless trump starts shooting african americans they wo n't be refugees . 
  does n't freezing just mean cold ? 
  as in : `` it 's freezing outside '' . 
  or the act of freezing as in : `` i 'm freezing '' . 
  finno-ugric masterrace !!!!, 
  we have a similar thing . 
  talo = house taloin = with houses taloinenne = with your houses taloinennekaan = not even with your houses taloinennekokaan = not even with your houses ? 
  you make many many of these . 
  here 's a relevant polandball : http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/comics-dog-countryballs-finland-1438258.png, 
  in finnish we have different words for maternal uncle and paternal uncle . 
  yeah , we also have a word for 24 hours , it 's vuorokausi . 
  well originally it was the name of a thunder god , but usually it 's used to refer to the devil . 
  and it 's a swear word , as is `` saatana '' , another word for the devil . 
  it 's funny how pirtti has a different meaning in finnish than the lithuanian word . 
  pirtti means a kind of a peasant house . 
  sauna means sauna . 
  why not ? 
  wow , it 's almost the same word as the eastern finnish `` vasta '' . 
  thanks !, 
  finnish has the same thing : kaukokaipuu . 
  it means `` missing the far away '' . 
  is n't it like `` good enough '' or something ? 
  according to wikipedia , the english word means : `` is the coating or deposit of ice that may form in humid air in cold conditions , usually overnight '' so this : http://biansi.net/images/frost-wallpapers/frost-wallpapers-2.jpg, 
  what do they mean ? 
  we 'd just be very shocked .
