  i do n't think any of those would directly affect us , except that there would probably be more iraqi refugees coming , so it doesnt really matter to us . 
  but we 'd think you 're a bunch of morons for electing him . 
  i mean , he 's not even trying to hide what a massive asshole he is . 
  there 's no redeeming quality in the man . 
  a lot of us are wondering the same thing . 
  we just have a lot of surnames . 
  seriously , there are 22 686 surnames in finland that are still in use . 
  wait , how did you destabilize the middle east ? 
  i 've never heard of that happening anywhere . 
  of course , if you 're used to it . 
  a hundred years ago han chinese people thought that unbound women 's feet looked weird . 
  to african mursi people women with lip plates look normal . 
  to some people female genitalia that has n't been mutilated and sown shut looks strange . 
  it 's all about what you 're used to seeing . 
  of course . 
  but you 're making it seem like the us is some kinda huge benefactor that 's waging war on the other side of the globe for purely altruistic reasons . 
  i 've had a woman try to sell me a rose in germany . 
  we had them too in the 19th century in easternmost finland and karelia . 
  here 's a photo of a professional karelian mourner taken in 1861 : http://www.kalevalaseura.fi/kaku/kuvat1/s245_inhamaura.jpg, 
  during the continuity war when nazi germany and finland were allies and fighting against the soviet union . 
  a bunch of german soldiers got surrounded by soviet forces . 
  a certain finnish lieutenant called salomon klass was ordered to help them with his men , which he did . 
  a german colonel with his staff came to klass 's tent to thank the finnish soldiers . 
  he complimented klass on his excellent german and klass said : `` that 's because i 'm jewish and my native language is yiddish . '', 
  everyone stared at him , stunned . 
  then the colonel stood up and shook hands with him and said : `` personally , i have nothing against you as a jew . '', 
  then he said `` heil hitler ! '', 
  and left , as did his staff . 
  klass was offered the prestigious nazi-german award , the iron cross , but of of course declined . 
  french : - negresses vertes , c'est pas la mer a boire : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_je0ncxqa1o, 
  uh , i 'm not entirely sure that 's the reason for all those coups and little wars . 
  is that really true ? 
  i mean , i keep hearing about normal , americans living in cities , who keep loaded handguns in their houses and cars . 
  what ? 
  was n't nationalism originally the idea that every people would have its own country , which contributed to the unification of germany and italy and the collapse of the russian empire and austria-hungary . 
  that 's what i learned in school at least . 
  circumcision - i recently learned that a lot of americans have the foreskin cut off their babies dicks even if they 're not jewish or muslim . 
  i still do n't understand why , since there obviously is n't any good reason for a anyone to want cut off a piece of a child 's genitalia . 
  like what the fuck america , i know you 're obsessed with looks , but cosmetic surgery on a baby ... that 's some creepy serial killer shit . 
  - solitary confinement : it 's fucking torture and everyone knows it . 
  prolonged solitary confinement makes people go insane . 
  in a lot of ways us prison conditions are deplorable for a first world country and the sentences are waaaaay too high . 
  one percent of the population of the us is in prison . 
  that 's one in a hundred . 
  and do n't get me started on the death sentence , especially since so many people have been exonerated after being fried . 
  and of course the treatment of `` illegal enemy combatants '' i.e. 
  pows is shameful . 
  absolutely . 
  english 2 . 
  english 3 . 
  english, 
  sea islands , with ferries : houtskari ( houtsk\u00e4r ) , korppoo ( korpo ) , kakskerta , hirvensalo sea island with boat : ahvenanmaa ( \u00c5land ) lake island , with boat : viikinsaari i 've also cross country skied on ice to some small island one , but i ca n't remember its name . 
  and then there 's tons of lake islands i 've probably driven to on bridges without ever noticing that i 'm on an island . 
  i can only speak for myself of course , but personally i do n't give a shit about what someone looks like or where their family comes from . 
  as the universal declaration of human rights says : `` all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . '', 
  could be because lactose-intolerance is really common among finns . 
  i think it 's 18 % or so . 
  we mostly have middle ages festivals ( keskiaikamarkkinat ) . 
  the ones in turku and h\u00e4meenlinna are probably the biggest ones . 
  they typically have some performances and vendors who sell food , jewelry , clothes , instruments , tableware etc. 
  we have the word `` juntti '' which i guess translates to hillbilly . 
  it means an uncivilized , prejudiced and rude person who probably lives in the countryside . 
  this reminds me of an old , vulgar finnish song about the soviet union , which some people like to sing in the sauna for some reason . 
  there are a lot of different versions , but here are a few verses translated into english : the sauna song the siberian tundra is wast sonya is shoveling snow there , hey !, 
  sonya had a really shitty luck a new wind brought new snow , hey !, 
  ___________________________________________________________________________ horse-flies buzz over siberia igor is flailing at them there , hey !, 
  it 's a sad thing that in whole of russia no functioning swatters are to be found , hey !, 
  ____________________________________________________________________________ i 'm an old kolkhoz woman i have no friends at all , hey !, 
  i have no cow and no sheep and not one tooth in my mouth , hey !, 
  _________________________________________________________________________ i 'm a poor boy from petroskoi i have no friends at all , hey !, 
  a hammer and a sickle shine in the sky it smells of shit and the balalaika chimes , hey !, 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's much better than our anthem `` maamme '' . 
  maamme has the same melody as the estonian anthem , and the melody originally comes from a german drinking song . 
  there is always some talk about changing the national anthem every now and then , but nothing really serious . 
  `` noin viikon uutiset '' is similar and pretty good . 
  the finlandia hymn , composed in 1899 by the great composer jean sibelius is the obvious choice . 
  it has an incredibly beautiful melody . 
  the song was banned by russian censorship as because of its nationalistic title . 
  it was played publicly with many other names as a form of passive resistance . 
  the composer originally did n't write lyrics to it and said `` it 's not meant to be sung . 
  it 's written for an orchestra . 
  but if the world wants to sing , what can you do . '', 
  the lyrics are about freedom and independence . 
  here 's a nice version of it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_dy5kuf-ie here 's a choir doing a great flashmob of it on a train station : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jakko3vgany it 's also great for female voices . 
  here 's a great women 's choir singing it beautifully : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nahhjlhltk8, 
  i 'm curious , how can you pledge not to engage in any war ? 
  i mean , what would you do if some country attacked austria ? 
  that depends on the year . 
  some summers there are hardly any mosquitoes and sometimes it 's unbearable to walk in the forest wearing a t-shirt . 
  swimming is very popular , we have a lot of lakes . 
  swimming classes are mandatory in school , so everyone learns to swim . 
  very casual . 
  for example we do n't sensor tv programs like they do in the us and the sex education in school is very good . 
  we had to practice putting a condom on a dildo . 
  people do n't lie to their children about where babies come from . 
  native : finnish fluent : english fluent : swedish mediocre : french, 
  it 's really popular here . 
  i do n't understand why you do n't call it yoghurt though .
