  yeah , finnish is a young language .

  what the saying means though is : `` we get to complain about our country being the coldest , most boring , shit hole on earth , but if someone else finds one little thing they do n't love about it , we 'll never ever forgive them . '', 
  we have the same attitude about badmouthing our country . 
  there 's a saying that goes : `` finland is the worst country in the world , except for all the other countries . '', 
  trump obviously . 
  i mean , no one even needs to try to make him look bad , the man 's doing a great job doing it himself . 
  he just keeps spewing disgusting , racist , misogynistic bullshit . 
  a few examples : `` when mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us . 
  they 're bringing drugs . 
  they 're bringing crime . 
  they 're rapists . 
  and some , i assume , are good people . '', 
  ( campaign launch 2015 ) `` if hillary clinton ca n't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy america ? '', 
  ( twitter , 2015 -- later deleted ) `` i would bring back waterboarding and i 'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding . '', 
  republican presidential debate , abc news 2016 ) the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families , when you get these terrorists , you have to take out their families . '', 
  `` i get called by a guy that ca n't buy a pair of pants , i get called names ? '', 
  ( trump 's comment about paralyzed commentator charles krauthammer ) `` look at that face !, 
  would anyone vote for that ? 
  can you imagine that , the face of our next president ?!, 
  i mean , ( carly fiorina 's ) a woman , and i 'm not supposed to say bad things , but really , folks , come on . 
  are we serious ? '', 
  that sounds strange since the finnish ukko is a male thunder god . 
  btw the word ukko means `` old man '' in modern finnish and the word for thunder is `` ukkonen '' . 
  i was never exposed to any superstitions either , i 'm way too young for that . 
  my grandparents were born in the 30s and 40s in a very modern world . 
  i 've read about mythology in books though , and i read the epic kalevala in school . 
  it 's not difficult for all dialects , and i believe the standard written language , which was invented in the 16th so the bible could be translated into finnish , was influenced by one of the dialects where it 's actually pronounced as syd\u00e4n . 
  finnish wkipedia : https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartto, 
  i do n't know anything about hungarian mythology , so i ca n't answer that . 
  however , i find it unlikely , considering how far away finnish and hungarian peoples lived from each other , and how they were influenced by very different peoples . 
  can you tell me anything about hungarian pre-christian religion ? 
  it seems most people consider him a disgusting , opportunistic , lying , racist , misogynistic , scumbag . 
  but we 're not part of nato and america is far away . 
  we wo n't have to share a border with trump like we do with putin . 
  they are stereotyped as being creepily attracted to weapons and keeping hand guns in their houses , cars or purses , though . 
  countries that used to be part of the eastern block are eastern european . 
  i think `` the west '' includes the united states , canada , australia , new zealand and all of europe , but not turkey or russia . 
  oh , we celebrate it too !, 
  with bonfires . 
  but we do n't jump over them , they 're too heigh , like this : http://www.hs.fi/webkuva/taysi/560/1305839256567?ts=268, 
  i can often spot finnish faces when abroad . 
  i once spent a long history lesson wondering what elsass-lothringen is . 
  turns out it 's the german name for alsase-lorraine . 
  `` if i 'm speaking finnish it will certainly be tartu and tallinna '' you mean tartto ? 
  tartu is the estonian name . 
  apparently there is a private university in finland , the helsinki school of business , but they have a fee of several thousands of euros . 
  it seems that people go there because you do n't have to do any entrance exams , so it 's easy to get in . 
  i 'd never heard of it before googling this . 
  all other universities are free . 
  finnish dialects are quite diverse . 
  for example , saying the letter d is a bit difficult for finns , so there are different ways to avoid it in different dialects . 
  for example , depending or the area , the word syd\u00e4n ( heart ) can be said as : sy\u00e4n , syr\u00e4n or syv\u00e4n . 
  `` i '' is `` min\u00e4 '' in finnish , but few people actually use that word in everyday speech . 
  depending on the area it can be m\u00e4 , m\u00e4\u00e4 , mn\u00e4\u00e4 , mie , or mi\u00e4 . 
  it 's 21 \u00b0 c. 
  there 's a finnish form of neopaganism based on the pre-christian religious traditions . 
  they have an association of finnish native religion . 
  is st. john 's day on midsummer ? 
  thank you . 
  i had n't thought about mythology . 
  yeah , can you give some examples please ? 
  i ca n't think of much right now apart from similar languages and not being as awkwardly social and friendly as the swedes . 
  what do you think is more similar ? 
  people being more introverted ? 
  sweden . 
  makes sense , it was one country for 600 years or so . 
  polandball is a great webcomic about different countries and in it estonia really wants into nordic . 
  and then he tried to marry another girl , but she too thought he was too old and married his friend instead . 
  the thing is , he was born old and wrinkled so he never really had a chance . 
  he 's an extremely powerful and great wizard , but very unattractive . 
  in finnish we also have this miss\u00e4 olet ? 
  = where are you ? 
  = where are you going ? 
  mist\u00e4 tulet = where are you coming from ? 
  and then there is the glorious word with a shit tons of vowels : riuuy\u00f6aie . 
  it means something like `` wooing night intention '' . 
  i imagine it would be quite hard to pronounce for a non native speaker . 
  and there 's tons of these in finnish and estonian . 
  `` kortsukreemi '' means under eye cream in estonian , but in finnish it would mean condom lube . 
  `` hallitus '' the finnish word for government means mold in estonian . 
  `` pussata '' means `` to kiss '' in finnish , but in estonian it means `` to fart '', 
  eduard douwes dekker , a 19th century dutch writer used the dramatic pen name multatuli , which is latin for `` i have suffered greatly '' . 
  in finnish `` multa tuli '' means `` i cummed '' . 
  there is even a hotel named after him in amsterdam , which finnish tourists find quite amusing . 
  i wast thought in french class that you say it twice . 
  but then again they also thought us to call the waiter `` gar\u00e7on '', 
  also , in finnish `` kissa '' means cat . 
  in swedish it means `` to pee '' . 
  in finnish `` katso merta '' means `` look at the sea '' . 
  in italian it 's `` fucking shit '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure some tourists have learned this the hard way . 
  oh , sorry , i misread the comment . 
  aboriginal australians are n't . 
  in finland a type or air-raid shelter called `` v\u00e4est\u00f6nsuoja '' is very common .
