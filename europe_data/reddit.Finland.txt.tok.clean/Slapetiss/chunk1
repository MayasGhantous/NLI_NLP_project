  finland - 100 % netherlands - 99 %, 
  russian agenda : ussr = good guys everyone else = nazis, 
  trump is probably the * only * us president anyone has heard of before the election . 
  was berlin rebuilt using old blueprints or largely new , with the tragic commie blocks of the '50s ? 
  one has a potato in his mouth , the other a penis .

  a running joke about some disgusting bar in lahti ( aka asshole of finland # 5373 ) that serves kebab meat in cups . 
  by my logic svd is older and has an english wiki where i can read about it and determining : who owns it , what ideological and political values it portrays and how large it is in sweden , thus obviously making it a better choice . 
  the local is apparently some english-only , web-only news outlet from 2004 that is owned by a unknown company with unknown agenda . 
  falls in the same category as that german blog , unless they 'd make an effort to prove otherwise . 
  thank you for your kind words and you 're very welcome to visit . 
  this year of celebration should be filled with events all over the country . 
  mannerheim was an important figure in the birth of finland and the many hardships that were endured when the country took its first steps . 
  he 's not completely uncontroversial in finland either , though . 
  the civil war of 1918 had brothers fighting brothers and as the leader of the anti-communist side , he was blamed for the hard awakening that the red guard received when they lost their revolution . 
  his service in the imperial russian army is still remembered in finland in a unique way - when drinking a mannerheim snaps , the shot glass is typically filled to the rim so that the surface tension holds the content in the glass . 
  this is how mannerheim learned to drink his daily ration in the imperial russian army . 
  it was a way of evenly distributing the rations among the men . 
  nepotism for example ... 
  most criminals are just opportunists . 
  popularity comes from correctly executed business strategy which nokia failed . 
  nokia was however only one piece of the puzzle - the forestry industry was simultaneously hit as well as the sanctions against russia and from russia . 
  it all accumulated into the perfect storm . 
  what the others have mentioned plus banks went under and unemployment became widespread in some cities . 
  finland had deep economic turbulance due to the ussr collapse . 
  we have also been in the 2008 - recession until now . 
  because brexit did n't turn out to be exactly what they promised . 
  hats off to the police for their work this year . 
  they had built a wall of vans and riot police between the anarchists and neonazis . 
  tanks drive on finnish city roads in parades twice a year . 
  a bit overkill for this type of operation , though . 
  best seats at valhalla , you jelly ? 
  that incident was not politically motivated . 
  coming from a background in the maritime sector , it 's less about transport cost and more about * time * . 
  plus the archipelago with \u00c5land and pargas/parainen . 
  turku and the capital area would perhaps more correctly be striped . 
  dw is the same source as op used and whataboutism does n't win you any awards . 
  next . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/young-jews-in-germany-fear-for-their-safety/a-17824914  the chanted slogans such as , `` hamas , hamas !, 
  jews into gas ! '', 
  for him , words like this have nothing to do with israel - they are `` purely anti-semitic , '' he says . 
  you can relativize it any way you want , but it sure sounds like we already know who they are afraid of . 
  what happened to him is not an isolated incident . 
   `` in paris there is a relatively large jewish community , '' said aileen . 
  `` this really appealed to me because i did n't have something like that in hamburg . '', 
   but the current circumstances have made her feel more unsafe . 
  `` the acts of aggression that you see here are extreme , '' she said . 
  `` burning cars and attacks on synagogues are a frightening sight . '', 
  http://www.jpost.com/diaspora/german-jewish-leaders-we-are-no-longer-safe-here-442078  he said the disintegration of state power , excesses of the extreme right-wing , the loss of political credibility , and `` the terrible fear of naming islamism as such '' have contributed to an insecure environment for jews . 
  the website is only in german , though . 
  how are they supposed to reach their target audience ? 
  / edit : the background to the project is even stated it in the article :  ott himself was previously targeted by three men who , on noticing his kippah , surrounded him and began chanting palestine . 
  he did n't realize it would completely counter his point , because women are 2nd class citizens in saudi arabia . 
  are you female ? 
  i do n't like speaking with people i know on public transport either . 
  [ pool 's closed ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/123/667/irlswastigetfinland.jpg ), 
  of course the weather is shit in helsinki . 
  it 'd be news if the baltic militaries were n't training for war . 
  what else are they supposed to do ? 
  hopefully there will be riots , fixit and world war before we give up our undeniable human right to unlimited data . 
  fucking barbarian eu scum trying to bring us back to the middle ages with their data cap bs . 
  wow , here i was and almost thinking you were gon na post something that was n't related to pushing your immigrant agenda . 
  fatties float better so watch and learn - your time will come . 
   the tests are a `` new large-scale provocation '' aimed at `` escalating the conflict between ukraine and russia , '' russia 's foreign ministry said on november 30 . 
  he says with a straight face while russian troops stand on occupied ukranian ground . 
  in that case you can call them and have it updated !, 
  what do you mean same ? 
  they are different companies as far as i know , might be using the same network though . 
  huh , i have problems with giffgaff even in central london . 
   i have a plan with a data cap here in finland . 
  from who ? 
  the price of each plan instead determines the maximum speed you get . 
  kinda counts as a limit i guess , but not a data limit . 
  strips of highways in finland double as emergency runways to decentralize the air force in case of war .

  * it 's the whole point of the thread . 
  sorry to be rude , but you 're not doing yourself any favors by pretending to be a moron . 
  especially admitting that you do n't even know about some key concepts in the topic at hand . 
  it does n't lend you any credibility in the discussion . 
   why would you equate the two ? 
  this malicious expansionist narrative is what russia has been pushing for decades . 
  unfortunately , some in the west also believe it . 
   it 's so easy to argue a non-logical point that no one uses or says after you make it . 
  what ? 
  what are you even talking about ? 
   and aggressor ? 
  from 50 years ago ? 
  1991 , when eastern europe was finally liberated , was 25 years ago . 
  people were killed in the process . 
  most people alive there have experienced it first hand . 
  the problem with talking about `` nato expansion '' is that it implies that nato forced itself into these countries . 
  it 's really the opposite ; they wanted nato there to protect them from russia - the hostile neighbor that had occupied them for the last half century . 
  the fdf is known for making very cost-effective decisions . 
   maintenance needs and systems will probably matter more than the up front costs . 
  definitely . 
  this is also has a big impact on flight hours - a cost-effective plane like gripen allows our pilots get several times more flight hours compared to the f-35 . 
  that experience is crucial if the pilot is to `` become one '' with the plane . 
  says a lot about the `` war '' they 're fleeing from :  hassan said : `` some say they do n't like the food here , it 's too cold or they do n't feel welcome in finland .
