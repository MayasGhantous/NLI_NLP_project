well , he is in tornio . 
  the only reason people go to tornio is that you have to travel trough it to get to ikea on the other side of the border . 
  my personal favourite is one with d\u00f6ner kebab , perfect finnish-turkish fusion dish . 
  you guys have djs in subways ? 
  we have those in finland , i went to one as a kid in the early-mid 90 's . 
  lol , one finnish name on the current squad . 
  not that surprised to be honest , i did n't even know we had a team . 
  camping in the forest , marching , getting yelled at , and maybe even getting to shoot some guns  actual honest work imo .

  [ mrw i saw this post .

  will could be considered to be an express written consent , same way one may express one 's preferred way of disposition of his or her body but instead of saying `` i want to be cremated '' one could say `` chop up my body and feed it to carrion birds in a sky burial , but before you do that let bob fuck my corpse . '' . 
  yes , it would be unusual and most likely the relatives of the deceased would object but if necrophilia would be made legal with consent no one could oppose that as far i know the preference of disposasition of one 's body is generally strictly enforced . 
  disclaimer : i 'm neither a lawyer nor advocate of necrophilia , i just like discussing weird shit in the internet . 
  would n't it technically be same as donating one 's body to science , but instead of advancing science someone get 's their rocks off . 
  well , i 'm not really defending necrophilia but from a legal perspective the person could have written in his will that `` so-and-so can have sex with my corpse after i 'm dead . '', 
  that could count as a consent . 
  you do understand that actually sweden is a third world country , just like finland ? 
  1st world : us & buddies during cold war , 2nd world : soviets & buddies during cold war , and 3rd world : neutral countries . 
  while the neutral countries include places like to poorer countries in south america and africa it also includes countries like finland , sweden , austria , switzerland , and ireland . 
  correct terminology for them would be a [ `` ground effect vehicle '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ground_effect_vehicle ) . 
  calling them airplanes is misleading as they can not fly out of the ground effect . 
  they are also not hovercraft like that article claims them to be and share very little in common with them , it 's even less of a hovercraft than it is an airplane . 
  it 's actually pretty decent when you remember that it 's a store brand beer , same with rainbow beer . 
  pirkka iii-olut and rainbow lager are actually brewed by olvi so i would consider them to be in the same category as karjala and both of them beat it hands down . 
  not really , it 's in the same price range as any other similar domestic lager like lapin kulta or karhu . 
  i 'd rather drink pepsi max than karjala , that stuff is vile . 
  when someone says `` the king '' first thing that comes to my mind is [ kungen ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kungen&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjiwywm8_zkahwfwhikhc8ddteq_auibygb&amp;biw=1918&amp;bih=995 ) .

  but texas is the most famous of it outside us . 
  you raise your hand and wait for a supervisor to come to you , explain that you need a toilet break . 
  you will leave all your stuff on to your desk and the supervisor will walk you to the toilet while keeping an eye on you so you wo n't try take a peek at other peoples papers , then he will wait outside of the toilet for you to do the deed and after that you will be escorted back to your seat .

  i 'd say it 's probably somewhere around ~ 15.00 . 
  krita is better for painting . 
  [ yes . 
  not the op but that would be pretty much how much it costs in finland , 500g international letter is at least 10.50 $ , more if shipped really far ( us/japan/etc . ) . 
  edit : noticed that you can send a letter that 's less than 3cm thick for 5.20 $ , but tbh you ca n't really fit anything in to that size . 
  [ prices for reference . 
  well , it was sold to microsoft year ago but it still operates from sweden . 
  because mojang is swedish . 
  is there alcohol available in the room ? 
   do the laundry ? 
  clean their houses/apartments ? 
  actually , yes , those are taught under `` kotitalous '' which also includes cooking . 
  that 's why it 's traditional to have a beer when in sauna , i guess you could use sacramental wine is an emergency replacement . 
  you do understand this is finland we are talking about ? 
  the home of sauna ? 
  they are from the late '70s and '80s so the insides are most likely lined with asbestos . 
  good luck burning that , you might be able to slightly singe the people inside them but that 's most likely it .

  it was n't the accent , their written english was bad . 
  my field is computer science and the language of this field is english , whether you like it or not . 
  if they were trolling they were dragging their grades down by doing it . 
  i 've witnessed the same thing in my university , i 've met french people in my masters program that absolutely butchered the english language . 
  funniest part is that during my studies on average french people i 've met have had worse grasp of the english language than any finn of same age i 've met even though our language is n't even in the indo-european language group .

  i actually placed an order for one just for shits and giggles , maybe i 'll end up little bit better informed on eu . 
  i also ordered [ this thing ] ( http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/handbook-on-european-law-relating-to-asylum-borders-and-immigration-pbtk0115852/?catalogcategoryid=0r6ep2owrcuaaafqeibumwcf ) because of the recent events , i realised i did n't know shit about eu immigration/asylum stuff so i decided to educate my self !, 
  i 'm just little bit disapointed with real snacks as their `` kaikilla mausteilla '' chips are my personal favourites . 
  though i 've noticed that generally the less `` adventurous '' new flavours are often better because the chip makers never seem to be brave enough with stranger flavours . 
  for example these chips would have been much better if they would 've gone all in and added more salmiakki to them , the current iteration just does n't have enough kick to it . 
  and yes , it is . 
  thanks !, 
  named my old mage in wow after her and the name kinda stuck . 
  copy paste from imgur gallery for mobile users : saw these at a local shop and had to buy a bag ( 1.19 $ for a bag of 120g ) when opening the bag there is a very slight scent of licorice , overall the scent is quite pleasant . 
  the taste is quite disapointing , they have very mild flavour of licourice . 
  imagine normal salted potato chips with a hint of licourice . 
  i was expecting much stronger flavour and looking at the incredients they do n't even have ammonium chloride listed as an incredient . 
  overall the flavour is not bad but it is quite underwhelming . 
  texture is good and the chips have good crunch in them . 
  overall verdict : disapointing flavour , not bad but not really good either . 
  horribly mediocre bag of chips . 
  would not recommend . 
  not op but :  slavic countries of europe , how do you feel about pan-slavism ? 
  ** non-slavs , how do you feel about slavs ?

  it 's even better when the guy doing juoksukaljat slips , crashes to the ground with m\u00e4yr\u00e4koira ( 12-pack ) in both hands , and then lies in the pool of beer and glass shards cursing while the security guys guard him waiting the police to arrive .

  never heard it called makkaraherkku before , only makkaraperunat . 
  you might even get to vote in the next municipal election if you stay long enough !, 
  anyone who 's at least 18 years old and has had a municipality of residence in finland for at least two years can vote . 
  you should have offered to buy him a pizza/beer/whatever he likes if he votes . 
  that 's how my parents got me to vote the first time , they bribed me with a pizza . 
  they did n't give a rat 's ass who i voted as long as i did vote .
