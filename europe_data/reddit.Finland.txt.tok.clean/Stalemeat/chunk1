i see . 
  i thought that it was already made elsewhere . 
   finland : finlandia vodka is the best too bad it is n't finnish anymore, 
  we do have high alcohol tax rates . 
  does n't stop us from drinking , and it 's easy to take a trip to estonia to get some cheap alcohol . 
  was n't there recently ( within 2-3 years ) a campaign to not drink around children ? 
  tv ads where kids saw adults as monsters or something . 
   i think portuguese is one of the nicest languages in the world ( up there with greek and finnish ) what makes finnish such a nice language ? 
  that 's kinda late , is n't it ? 
  my bad , did n't read through properly . 
  but in can mean both depending on context and tone of voice . 
  a little terrified . 
  why would n't you want to learn finnish ? 
  words have only a few forms . 
  for example the word kauppa ( a shop ) has only [ 2,253 ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) forms . 
  there are two pictures . 
  one from sweden and another from [ finland . 
  then you must first journey to the capital , there you will find the ferry of impaired memories . 
  board the ferry but be careful with the magic potions they serve . 
  take a longboat ( or a ferry ) to the east . 
  there is a magical land where good r\u00e5gbr\u00f6d is abundant . 
  you need better bread . 
  get some decent r\u00e5gbr\u00f6d instead of that pale pastry thing you 're eating . 
  otherwise looks pretty good . 
  you sure it was early june ? 
  ca n't come up with any reason to celebrate in early june . 
  closest would be midsummer ja pentecost but neither of those are in early june . 
  it 'd be interesting to find out what they were celebrating , in case it 's some old tradition . 
  `` lapland starts where ring iii ends '', 
   all the nordic holidays are celebrated up there too . 
  all the holidays ? 
  there are others than midsummer and christmas ? 
  i doubt that russia would try destabilize finland in the same way as ukraine . 
  bringing the finnish-russian relations back to the state they were during the cold war is more likely , in my opinion . 
  what would we need the rifle for ? 
  saw them 8-9 or something years ago . 
  they 're great live . 
  yeah , the price/drunkenness ratio is pretty good in it . 
  finns are never happy , just slightly less depressed . 
  more likely just pissed as fuck . 
  i 've tried it and there 's no way anyone is happy to be drinking that . 
  the finnish [ valdemar ] ( https://imgur.com/4pw9cto ), 
  the text above is finnish and one below is swedish . 
  they did n't . 
  there was a piece of news some time ago about people asylum seekers from safe countries ( mainly us and uk ) and they did n't get accepted as they did n't need asylum . 
  i 'm afro , you 're asian !, 
  did n't they settle on 15 ? 
  so vermont would be 16th . 
   no koskenkorva the bearded guy in # 4 is holding a bottle of koskenkorva . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  if you want to hear the difference , someone mixed the finnish and estonian version of the argument in lion king [ together ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyzpro-kgtk ) . 
  edit : and if someone transcribes the estonian , i 'll transcribe the finnish . 
  australians are liked afaik . 
  you guys opened [ bars ] ( http://aussiebar.net/ ) serving aussie and kiwi beers so that 's a good thing . 
  just because we try , it does n't mean we 'll succeed, 
   that said , i was also wrong too though because norway and denmark are not highlighted as well . 
  also finland is not a scandinavian country, 
  erinomainen would make more sense, 
  p\u00f3g mo th\u00f3in is fun a kissing related sentence, 
  the picture is taken from an alternative history website and depicts finland after germany had won the war . 
  no , just an individual with issues according to the police . 
  if they shot the tyres the bullets could ricochet and might hit someone , and a truck that big would still keep moving for a while . 
  [ there were more attack in the 70 's than there have been in recent years ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015 ), 
  metsat\u00f6ll is awesome and i thought at least folk metal fans would know it ? 
  hockey was the most popular sport in finland in 2014 followed by athletics , ( cross-country ) skiing , ski jumping and f1 . 
  this is purely anecdotal but it seems that football is getting more and more popular as years go by . 
  s\u00e1mi languages and finnish are n't the same . 
  drinks with less than 4,7 % alcohol content are sold in regular stores . 
  anything stronger than that you 'll have to buy from alko . 
  a lot of supermarkets have an alko in them , though . 
  yes , the state owns the national liquor store and they do sell some non-alcoholic drinks as well . 
  all you can think about is / u/ohnosaurus ' 4-year-old ? 
   central crime police [ national bureau of investigation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_bureau_of_investigation_\\ ( finland \\ ) ), 
  los serrano was really popular here a few years ago . 
  i think some of the actors evrn flew over to do a meet and greet . 
   * making fun of a couple of libertarian americans that wanted to connect with their heritage , only to spew political nonsense that may make sense for the us but it utter ridiculous for greeks . 
  no syriza is not like us democrats nor its communist . 
  have you guys read the american anarcho-capitalist goes greece and meets greek anarchists story ? 
  yeah it 's been used since the hakkapeliittas used it in the thirty years ' war, 
  strike upon them or something like that ), 
  jari litmanen and sami hyypi\u00e4 . 
  yeah 95 was the first championship victory against you guys , the other one being 2011 . 
  there are a [ few ] ( https://www.kotus.fi/files/1247/murrealueet_www.jpg ), 
  2003 hockey world championships . 
  we had 5-1 lead against sweden and they ended up winning 5-6 . 
  sievin jalkine makes good shoes . 
  and [ pulk ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulk ) too, 
  i really like the estonian flag and the s\u00e1pmi flag . 
   - iceland  - norway  - sweden  - denmark all the nordics except finland :(, 
  6th of december is our independence day . 
  and kosteat meemut for dank memes . 
  yeah , it 's only used in poems ( lapin kes\u00e4 by eino leino for example ) as far as i know . 
  ma olen is `` i am '' in estonian right ? 
  it 's the same in finnish but ma in finnish is a poetic way to say i. 
  oh completely forgot about that even though i live in northern ostrobothnia . 
  [ yes it is ] ( http://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/nimipalvelu/default.asp?l=1 ) edit : since that link did n't link directly to the search result , here is a screenshot http://m.imgur.com/zlr8541, 
  we do that in finland too . 
  the kids go from door to door , offering willow branches and a rhyme in exchange for candy . 
  only 412 years old , there have of course been people around here far longer than that . 
  everytime it 's saint someone 's church .
