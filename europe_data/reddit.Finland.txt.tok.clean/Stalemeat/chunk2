  it 's written in full such as `` pyh\u00e4n laurin kirkko '' . 
  there are no shortenings as far as i know . 
  cat , mirri is the only animal related term i can think of . 
  i do n't know . 
  i guess they see scandinavians as a a people and finland comes in through shared history or something . 
  they want to unite the scandinavian countries and finland to create a single national socialist state . 
  so just a bunch of nazis . 
  they 're notable because they 've been involved in a few violent incidents in finland ( and even more in sweden i think ), 
  i do n't care , i just want us to do well for once :(, 
  i do n't think there are any notable revisionist movements . 
  some people want the parts we lost to russia back but no notable movement exists . 
  there is the nordic resistance movement if that counts . 
  [ helsinki slang or stadin slangi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_slang ) is probably the most radically different dialect . 
  [ markku uusipaavalniemi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markku_uusipaavalniemi ) was a chuck norris replacement for a while after the turin olympics . 
  also all houses are required to grow hops . 
  i do n't listen to a lot of rap but here are some finnish songs i like : asa - [ \u00c4rr\u00e4npeet\u00e4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajj0wdwznk8 ) huge l - [ lingvisti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5183xxw0nbm ) tapani kansalainen feat . 
  pete parkkonen - [ tuulisii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cedouq2ailg ), 
  no idea if anyone tells tourists , they were in the news a few years ago . 
  the police painted the antlers with reflecting paint to make them more visible in the winter . 
   except with the occasional glowing moose . 
  we 've already got [ those ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/375/media/images/73063000/jpg/_73063823_reindeer.jpg ) here in finland . 
  well , reindeers instead of moose but close enough . 
  various hide and seek games , football , maa ( means earth/land/ground draw a circle on sand , divide it between players , throw a stick in the air and run . 
  whoever 's portion of labd the stick hits has to try and hit another player with the stick and if he does he can take a piece of their land ) , swing ball ( one tries to hit people in the swing to the stomach with a football ) and tag at least . 
  edit : and porridge kettle . 
  there was a circle with few places to stand , one walked around the people standing and eventually dropped a stick behind one . 
  that person then had to run to the opposite direction to the one going round and hit their own place faster . 
  if they were n't fast enough they had to start going around . 
  and if they did n't run at all they had to go to the middle and wait for someone to release them ( do n't remember how that happened though ), 
  sunday mass used to be shown by the finnish broadcasting company but i 'm not sure if they still do that . 
  during easter and christmas there are some religious programming iirc and there is a religious tv-channel that shows programs that show the flaws in evolution and other stupid bullshit too . 
  l\u00e4hell\u00e4 rantaa and rannempana are n't the same though . 
  l\u00e4hell\u00e4 rantaa means close to the beach while rannempana just means closer to the shore . 
  moomin , sandokan , biker mice from mars , pokemon , x-men , batman and spider-man were my favourites . 
  animals of the farthing wood and the nils holgersson show were good too . 
  irc-galleria used to be big in finland . 
  and otso ( bear ), 
  fairly often . 
  where do you play ? 
  i usually play on lichess , but i 've got an account on chess24 too if you want to play sometime . 
  bars and nightclubs . 
  it 's too warm . 
  roads become so slippery when the ice melts and freezes again and again . 
  using herra ( mr. ) , rouva ( mrs. ) or neiti ( ms ) is uncommon , but people tend to use te ( you ) to be polite ( as opposed to sin\u00e4 ( you ) ) . 
  there 's 10 . 
  and well i wanted to show different genres of music . 
  [ art effects ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbfme0-yfgq ) [ satellite stories ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt43vyqorhy ) [ sentenced ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woki6l5q260 ) [ mors subita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztesht7qcbg ) [ aknestik ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8ui5eezv30 ) ( they are n't from my city but fairly close ) [ radiopuhelimet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th-nepq5hwu ) [ kauko r\u00f6yhk\u00e4 & narttu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjg6d55nxza ) [ hebosagil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntx2jbj-jgi ) [ jamppa tuominen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c87cofo0zno ) edit : and i probably should mention [ saara aalto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kafl-7xmmw ) , due to her recent appearance in x-factor uk, 
  for me it sounds better when doing it as a countdown , partly do to the abrupt end . 
  though it 's interesting that it sounds better since traditionally the word with the most syllables goes to the end ( viskurilaki ) if you look at traditional poetry , or naming conventions . 
  mayo is a popular choice in oulu , but not elsewhere in finland iirc . 
   then there 's the vast majority of heretics who do `` rock-paper-scissors '' ( kivi-paperi-sakset ) . 
  you 're the heretic . 
  if you say kivi-sakset-paperi the rhythm is all wrong , kivi-paperi-sakset just simply sounds better . 
  a lot of people watch the declaration of christmas peace too . 
  yeah , it 's been around for a couple of years now and it 's constantly getting more widespread every year . 
  yeah , the people who came up with the slogan should go back to school . 
  there are a few . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://vimeo.com/37298022 ) [ 2 ] ( https://vimeo.com/40224482 ) [ 3 ] ( https://vimeo.com/40223855 ) [ 4 ] ( https://vimeo.com/37298448 ) but my favourite is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhp2uaf4zny ), 
  local dialect of finnish and on a very rare occasion swedish . 
  i also heard sami and russian a couple of times when visiting relatives . 
  and most people use `` se '' when they speak . 
  = i wonder if i should run around aimlessly too . 
  i would 've used the word `` lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliupseerioppilas '' as an example, 
  paskat is plural in finnish so it 's shits as in n\u00e4m\u00e4 paskat = these shits . 
  perse is also ass in finnish , which caused sniggering during history lessons when talking about the city of persepolis . 
  it 's a good subreddit but i tend to avoid any threads related to immigration and refugees . 
  pretty much, 
  both of you are being ridiculous , greater finland shall finally rise . 
  not really . 
  there are some contests iirc but not a lot . 
   inglantialainen englantilainen is the correct spelling for an english person . 
  i remember that thread . 
  you did n't respond well to any of the arguments made in thread and kept insisting on getting evidence and saying that your teacher said this and that . 
  and people did point out that there probably is n't any official soviet documents or stuff like that available . 
  and nordic ( as well as us , british etc ) support meant very little in the war . 
  most foreign troops did n't do much and a lot of the material support did n't get here in time if it at all . 
  the problem was n't that you were n't anti-soviet it was that you kept repeating the same shit all over again ( `` my teacher this , my teacher that '' `` show me evidence '' ) and iirc you did n't really have much to back your view . 
  beer is the most drunk alcoholic drink, 
   there probably was other groups as well [ mc nikke t ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rpsyx0i49e ) and [ p\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6set ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm9cxiii5hg ) were the first somewhat successful artists alongside raptori . 
  the humour aspect did a disservice for finnish rap imo . 
  edit : and i think it should be mentioned that the rapper cheek is probably the most popular individual artist atm . 
  the way we 've treated the s\u00e1mi people comes to mind . 
  [ otto wille kuusinen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_wille_kuusinen ) and [ hella wuolijoki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hella_wuolijoki ) were first people i thought of . 
   it 's pretty distinct for a dialect to use `` sin\u00e4 '' as well yeah , i used `` sin\u00e4 '' because op asked to compare to standard language which i 'd say is the way the newsreaders speak . 
  the oulu dialect . 
  the most distinct trait of the dialect is that when you say `` you '' we say `` n\u00e4\u00e4 '' instead of `` sin\u00e4 '', 
  here 's a few lasten hautausmaa - [ tuulipuut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmrstqsmikc ) stam1na - [ l\u00e4\u00e4ke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsmp8vp8tme ) apulanta - [ anna mulle piiskaa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlualsbfloi ) tapio rautavaara - [ kulkuriveljeni jan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsd_l49j6lw ) chisu - [ yksin\u00e4isen keijun tarina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvppceno7ue ) sotajumala - [ kuolinjulistus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huht3j68ezi ) hector - [ ake , make , pera ja m\u00e4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjgu-obgn38 ) tuomari nurmio - [ valo y\u00f6ss\u00e4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=surzxdehgdu ) korpiklaani - [ veriset \u00e4p\u00e4r\u00e4t ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hez2m2q__aw ) moonsorrow - [ taistelu pohjolasta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d_snthfscg ) asa - [ pojat teki soppaa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wanecvbtdoo ), 
  finnish and english fluently and swedish poorly . 
  73 % i was expecting worse . 
  had n't we pretty much ran out of ammo etc when the treaty was signed , or is that just a rumour ? 
  time to go essentially . 
  it 's just something you 'd say when you 're going somewhere and have to wait for someone . 
  climb ass first into a tree . 
  rolls around like a lingonberry in a pussy . 
  we play [ pes\u00e4pallo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pes%c3%a4pallo ) in school . 
  other than that people tend to throw stuff around for fun . 
  porridge is quite normal . 
  potatoes with meat prepared in some way would be fairly standard lunch/dinner . 
  already made nowadays . 
  [ m\u00e4mmi ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/arkisto/article5236348.ece/alternates/w580/mammi ) definitely tastes better than it looks .
