  swedish-speaking finns still exist and if i remember correctly are on average richer than finnish-speakers . 
  for eu citizens , yes . 
   and what does it take for a foreigner to get in ? 
  become a citizen , do n't be too old . 
   by the way , do you offer college benefits ( tuition paid by a gi bill , etc ? ), 
  no benefits . 
  if it makes you feel any better we think your men are all gay . 
  rye bread , salmiakki and booze . 
  was n't that only an allegation ? 
  or has she commented on the issue officially ? 
  does n't she stay neutral on british politics in general ? 
  films are subbed except for children 's movies . 
  games are mostly in english . 
  it 's pretty similar to sweden . 
  i tend to use pankkiautomaatti , which is why i said it . 
  otto and the variations / u/beeristheanswer said are common too . 
  i 've never heard anyone say atm , but that 's because i mostly hang out with finnish-speakers . 
  bank automaton . 
  who ? 
  orange is the new black , a show on netflix . 
  pizza is great too especially with mayo . 
  kebab , or sausage and chips . 
  you can get a citizenship of a member state and by extension be a citizen of the eu . 
  the benefits of being a eu citizen ? 
  easy to travel , live and work in other countries within the union . 
  you 're also allowed to vote in elections , consular protection from any of the member states etc. 
  price to get a citizenship ? 
  live in the country for a few years , have a steady income , learn the language etc. 
  ( [ details specific for polish citizenship ] ( http://www.migrant.info.pl/how-to-obtain-polish-citizenship.html ) ) if you just visit the eu you have pretty much no chance of getting a citizenship . 
  do n't worry i 'm not offended , it 's common mistake . 
  scandinavia refers to denmark , norway and sweden . 
  the nordics refers to scandinavia , finland and iceland , so using it instead of scandinavia when talking about finland with sweden and norway etc would be better . 
   scandinavia fyi , finland is not a scandinavian country . 
  and blood pudding is great , definitely worth a try if you 've never eaten it before . 
  blood sausage is great too . 
  [ r\u00f6ssypottu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6ssypottu ) , [ karelian stew ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelian_hot_pot ) and [ saut\u00e9ed reindeer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saut%c3%a9ed_reindeer ) are my favourites . 
  germany or portugal . 
  they are deported to \u00c5land to live with swedish speakers . 
  1991 independence from the soviets, 
  58-69 all are political ones . 
  95 was also the year we joined the eu which would have been an acceptable answer as well . 
  1809\u00a01917\u00a01918\u00a01939 1941\u00a01958\u00a01961\u00a01969 1995 2002 couple of those might be too hard even for natives, 
  most of my friends served in the army . 
  some of the liked and some considered it to be a waste of time . 
  it 's no longer mandatory to take the swedish test in the matriculation examination but people still have to study it . 
  the most recent [ news ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/swedish_remains_obligatory_in_finnish_schools/7850431 ) is that the government accepted to find out if regional exceptions for the swedish could be tested ( in practice this would mean eastern-finland would teach russian instead ) . 
  we already have the nordic council . 
  i do n't think most people think about a nordic federation a lot . 
  no active discussions about it and do n't remember anyone discussing it seriously , however every now and then someone brings up increasing cooperation with the rest of the nordics . 
  personally more cooperation would n't be bad but i do n't see a need for a nordic federation . 
  about swedish in finland : about 5 % of finns are native swedish speakers but everyone is taught swedish in schools . 
  whether people speak it depends a lot on the region . 
  yeah she wrote more than just the moomin books , though she 's best known for them . 
  kuvanveist\u00e4j\u00e4n tyt\u00e4r ( bildhuggarens dotter ) and the summer book might be her best known works besides the moomins . 
  she also wrote plays , comic books , illustrated books ( notably [ the hobbit ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/7nj4o ) ) and painted . 
  lovecraft finnish : tove jansson, 
   mostly since you mentioned your mother is russian and porvoo was where it all happened when finland became a part of russia . 
  it 's also an incredibly beautiful town . 
   emblematic of violence and correlated with a high rate of premature deaths from violence and suicide as well as militarized police in the us maybe . 
  finland has a fairly high gun ownership and low gun violence and the police are far from militarized . 
  gun related suicides are still an issue but they can be reduced by gun control policies ( norway , for example , has been quite successful in this ) . 
  instead of banning gun ownership there should be proper gun control and suicides should be prevented by treating to causes . 
  raising awareness towards mental health issues and making easy and acceptable to get help are the ways to prevent suicides regardless of the method . 
  as for abortion , people are free to frown upon it in their personal lives if they want to do so but it should n't be official policy . 
  getting is n't exactly an easy decision so frowning upon it officially would add unnecessary stigma to it . 
  good sex education an access to birth control work fine in minimizing abortion rates . 
  what 's wrong with gun ownership ? 
  and why does abortion need to be officially frowned upon ? 
  done . 
  interesting questions . 
  on a side note , how did you get decide on your username ? 
  [ cheapest way to get drunk ] ( http://www.isokaato.com/top2.php ) in finland without going to estonia . 
  accents and [ dialects ] ( http://www.kotus.fi/files/1247/murrealueet_www.jpg ) are generally associated with the area one is from instead of class here . 
  and in finnish people usually use the word accent when referring to non-native speakers . 
  everyone is allowed to speak the way they do and in my experience teachers somewhat encourage it too ( at least when it comes to dialects ) . 
  there are plenty of good beaches by the sea in finland . 
   finland . 
  i would say go there if you like history and nature , but not as much for shopping and ** bathing ** . 
  what ? 
  i chose it from a list of books in my finnish textbook , so it was a standard choice at least that year . 
  only reason i chose it was that i found a full copy of it online so i did n't have to bother to go to the library . 
   the unknown soldier sounds similar to some of our famous war books , like catch 22 which try to present a less romanticized view of what war actually entails . 
  yeah if i remember correctly the book was meant to dispel the myths of obedient and noble soldiers . 
  it 's worth reading , though i have no idea how well they 've translated the language of the book . 
  oh and i read poe 's the masque of the red death in school at some point . 
  we usually had a bunch of books to choose which to read . 
  the unkown soldier by v\u00e4in\u00f6 linna anna liisa by minna canth go ask alice by beatrice sparks hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams the bomber by liza marklund those are the ones i remember reading . 
  there were others of course , but it 's been so long i ca n't really remember, 
  well , in that case i 'd recommend maybe going to london on a separate trip ( and maybe use that trip to go to places like oxford etc ) . 
  i spent a week there few years ago and feel like there 's so much more to see . 
  but i hope you have a fun trip any way you decide to do it !, 
  i 'd recommend starting from london if you 're going to visit there . 
  that way you do n't need to waste time driving from france to the uk and back again . 
  walking and public transport mostly at the moment . 
  i 'll switch to riding a bike once i get a new one . 
  there is [ pasila ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilwkib9gapg ) , [ moomins on the riviera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxv8ydvgz50 ) ( there 's also a moomin series which is great but was made in japan ) . 
  a lot of the finnish animation shown in finland is not 100 % but was done in co-operation with other countries . 
  did n't hear about it . 
  can you tell more about it ? 
   i can imagine a scandinavian union ( sweden , finland , norway , denmark , iceland ) nordic , not scandinavian .
