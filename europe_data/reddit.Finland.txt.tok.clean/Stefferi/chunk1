  `` taqiyya was initially practiced under duress by some of muhammad 's companions . 
  [ 11 ] later , it became particularly important for shias due to their experience as a persecuted religious minority . 
  [ 8 ] [ 12 ] according to shia doctrine , taqiyya is permissible in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby . 
  [ 8 ] taqiyya has also been politically legitimised , particularly among twelver shias , in order to maintain unity among muslims and fraternity among the shia clerics . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ] '' `` the basic principle of taqiyya is agreed upon by sunni scholars , though they tend to restrict it to dealing with non-muslims and when under compulsion ( ikr\u0101h ) , while shia jurists also allow it in interactions with muslims and in all necessary matters ( \u1e0dar\u016briy\u0101t ) . 
  [ 37 ] in sunni jurisprudence protecting one 's belief during extreme or exigent circumstances is called idtirar ( \u0625\u0636\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0631 ) , which translates to `` being forced '' or `` being coerced '' , and this word is not specific to concealing the faith ; for example , under the jurisprudence of idtirar one is allowed to consume prohibited food to avoid starving to death . 
  [ 38 ] additionally , denying one 's faith under duress is `` only at most permitted and not under all circumstances obligatory '' . 
  [ 10 ] '' this rather clearly does n't translate to the use of these words in the sense of `` all muslims like about everything all the time , expect when they 're saying things that fit to my worldview '' that it 's generally used by the anti-islam types . 
  no , that 's just a populist finnish myth . 
  no it does n't . 
  the study did not include a ` life force ' option . 
  according to that poll , though , the total number of finns who believe in god would be 52 % ( `` i believe in god as taught by christianity '' + `` i believe in god , though rather differently than what the church teaches '' ) .

  - no yle news story about this , but the local election campaigns are heating up . 
  one of the big races is the race for the first mayor of helsinki ( which was previously governed by city managers ) , with the two main candidates being from the greens and ( right-wing ) national coalition . 
  one of the main issues is the plan to build a grand mosque in helsinki ( which involves some shady plans for funding ) , with the national coalition candidate jan vapaavuori announcing he 's against the mosque no matter where the funding comes from . 
  also remember the difference between finnish and `` european '' drinking culture . 
  alcohol consumption in central european countries might mean a glass of wine with the dinner .

  it turns out some extreme-right candidates had ended up on the list of christian democrats - particularly embarrassing this strongly pro-israel party due to the antisemitism of at least one candidate . 
  these candidates result from a pact cd made with long-time politician and ex-centre party leader paavo v\u00e4yrynen , who apparently has now chosen to associate with the far right .

  - the state welfare agency has [ failed to pay many people 's welfare payments in time ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/kela_badly_behind_in_benefit_payments/9490696 ) , leading to harsh criticism . 
  some choice quotes : `` we can make a law that sun shines at night , but it still would n't do so . '', 
  `` god created adam and eve , not adam and steve '' ( he used the finnish name `` eero '' in his quote instead of `` steve '' , but that 's the idea ) `` let 's remember the bolsheviks . 
  they were also a small group of people who talked of love and solidarity . '', 
  `` i call for tolerance for those of us following christian values !, 
  where are the human rights for heterosexuals ? 
  changing the marriage law is like forcibly reprogramming the society . 
  being a dissident almost makes you a criminal .

  according to tabloid ilta-sanomat , they had interviewed hakkarainen , and hakkarainen had , after the interview , called them to say : '' - let 's put the gays , lesbians and somalis [ in aland ] to live with each others and see what sort of a model society they would build . 
  the swedish people 's party always accuses the true finns of not taking minorities into account . 
  with this society , we could see how the model society would take form . '', 
  according to the party secretary , hakkarainen was probably in a `` jolly mood '' , ie . 
  drunk . 
  http://www.savonsanomat.fi/kotimaa/teuvo-hakkarainen-isssa-laitetaan-homot-lesbot-ja-somalit-ahvenanmaalle/560456 it should be noted that teuvo hakkarainen is basically the class clown of the party and nobody takes him seriously , which is at times a pity , since he 's also one of the most far-right mps in the party and he gets away with lot due to the whole `` oh , he 's just a drunken fool '' factor . 
  that resembles finland , though in the more fringe circles you have some outright pro-russia people ( and the discussion often tends to move more along the lines of `` our trading relationship with russia should come before any human rights babble '' etc. , also the religious difference thing is not considered important ), 
  how does the croatian far-right view ( current ) russia ? 
  ** finland : ** - [ nordic world skiing competitions are going on in lahti .

  it fails . 
  greens do not vote on the motion , sparking criticism from the left-wing parties . 
  - populist party true finns seems to be getting increasingly creaky before the election , [ warning its more liberal mps for not voting against same-sex marriage ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finns_party_warns_mps_over_same-sex_marriage_support/9477005 ) and [ sacking a controversial local chairperson .

  ( this is a huge local issue in helsinki for some reason . ), 
  your view seems to be based on the idea that editors-in-chiefs have no effect . 
  if so , that does nothing to explain why finns see the papers as right-wing , apart from definitions where `` right-wing '' and `` left-wing '' no longer have any meaning in the finnish cultural context . 
  also , voting for greens , in particular , does not mean you 're particularly radical - it 's quite easy to jump from being a greens voter to being a national coalition voter , and many people do exactly that as they move from youth to adulthood . 
  ... and selecting immigration is a bit strange , considering the study itself showed that finns do n't see the papers as being right-wing ( or left-wing ) on immigration . 
  generally , the analyses one sees on how helsingin sanomat is a green-left rag brainwashing finland are the ones that focus only on immigration . 
  if i was speaking to someone , i would probably use simppeli , not yksinkertainen . 
  the chief editors are right-wing , and they set the line of the newspapers , moreso than `` regular '' reporters ( which that study did n't even focus on , just media students in one university ) . 
  http://aikalainen.uta.fi/2014/12/09/valtaeliitti-kannattaa-kokoomusta/ helsingin sanomat , while probably more neutral than the regional papers , still represents the liberal right , as is evident from its generally pro-nato stance , for instance . 
  well they will surely control it when sweden is taken over by the muslims and becomes a caliphate !, 
  ... sorry , is n't it a rule that someone always has to mention this when sweden is discussed ? 
  what left-leaning media ? 
  you missed the constant drumbeat of austerity during the last 5 years ( and castigating those opposed to it as irresponsible ) , the not-so-subtle pro-nato bias , the fact that basically every regional newspaper is either a national coalition or centre mouthpiece etc. 
  niilo pielinen in finnish . 
  like otherwhere , you can find niilo pielinen comics at pretty much every library , but he 's not as iconic as asterix , lucky luke or tintin . 
  https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/niilo_pielinen his surname in finnish comes obviously from the words `` menn\u00e4 pieleen '' ( to fail ) , which i actually just realized . 
  ... which is sort of amusing , because disdain for paulig juhla mokka coffee would be one of the most basic starting points of snobbery in finland . 
  never good enough , eh ? 
  regarding both legislation and general opinion , sweden is probably one of the most anti-cannabis countries in europe . 
  there are stories of american liberals going to sweden , finding everyone wonderfully progressive and so-on , then toking up in front of their newfound friends ( as would be normal where they come from ) and finding out everyone reacts like they had just murdered a small cute animal right then and there . 
  yeah i was expecting a doping reference . 
  there are actually not many negative stereotypes about norwegians in finland - you do get the occasional reference to church burnings , oil moneys and cod-eating - expect the one thing that 's drilled to every finn from childhood on through culture - the norwegians only beat us in skiing because they are better at using doping so they do n't get caught . 
  the sheer enjoyment many finns got out of the johaug case was quite obvious . 
  if you were in the european parliament , which political group would you join ? 
  finnish cities make little sense . 
  the capital region , tampere , lahti and pori urban areas appear to show up as red dots ( respectively 1. , 2. , 6 . and 7 . most populous ) , but turku , oulu and jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ( 3. , 4. , and 5 . ), 
  do not .
