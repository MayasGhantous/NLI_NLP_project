  most attention seems to be on the things happening beyond the atlantic ... 
  north of finland is more ( socially ) conservative than the south . 
  `` tyski\u00e4\u00e4 '' sounds like it could also be a word in a dialect ( say kainuu dialect ) . 
  `` yhtulii '' could not be a word , as `` y '' and `` u '' would not be in a same word unless it 's a compound word , which that is obviously not . 
  `` lmiseieess\u00e4a '' is just ridiculous . 
  finland does n't have an actual magical police lion , you know . 
  small nations are predisposed to sympathizing with other small nations . 
  scotland and finland are roughly of the same size , and scotland has already indicated its desire to become a nordic country if and when it splits from the uk . 
  what 's not to like ?

  i 'll ask the same here as in the `` preliminary thread '' : if razem was in ep , what political group would it be in ? 
  if you have an election with with five parties running as `` pan-european parties for pan-european people '' and five parties running as `` local parties for local people '' , the latter five will have a huge leg up and will probably share the vast majority of votes between themselves . 
  people do n't really seem to be clamoring for these pan-european parties , only the europhile intellectual types .

  i think you meant to say `` coastal tampere '' , there . 
  that 's not the worst german-related stereotype i could have included there . 
  ( during wwii 's final phases germans burned the town of rovaniemi and the locals are still rather salty about that . ), 
  the `` no-go zones '' have small towns like forssa and pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki which have a particularly bad reputation ( partly as a joke ) for being dreary . 
  the wrong language would be `` finnish '' or `` swedish '' , depending on your part of town . 
  english is not compulsory , but you have to study at least one foreign language ( in additon to finnish and swedish ) , and the vast majority will study english . 
  almost everyone under 40 will be able to speak english , and most of them will be fluent . 
  as one might guess from history , finland is not pro-russian and almost everyone will condemn the crimean annexation etc. , and certain concrete fears of russian expansionism exist , but there 's also a strong strain of realism related to this matter ( `` russia might be a dictatorship and an invader but we still have to live next to them and trade with them so let 's not get too carried away here '' etc. ), 
  finns are indeed very reserved , silent and need a lot of personal space . 
  the most annoying myth is that we all carry knives . 
  ( it 's just some regions ! ), 
  i 've heard that finns who move to sweden * still * have to regularly listen to `` dohohoho you 're from finland show us your knife '' type of blabber . 
  sure , it shows up a lot , though of course whether it 's an important political discussion at the moment comes and goes . 
  finland does n't really have that many muslims ( maybe 1 % of population ) , so much of finnish islamophobia is a sort of a `` look at what 's happening in sweden '' type of thing . 
  that 's kind of like finland 's thing . 
  moonsorrow is generally considered the gold standard in finnish folk metal . 
  not really good with tourist advice , sorry . 
  finns do n't really think of indians a lot . 
  indians as engineers/tech support guys , hinduism and cow worship , caste discrimination , widespread poverty - that 's what comes to mind . 
  this is n't a football country , and i myself am particularly not a football person . 
  finland is a bit different here , as the main `` national game '' is hockey . 
  football is a kind of a challenger sport , like in united states ( though there 's less of a negative type of a `` i would never watch soccer '' attitude that you seem to get in the states ) . 
  51 % of people in eu27 believed in god in 2010 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe ) . 
  that 's not a majority . 
  only 20 % are atheists . 
  finland is ( officially ) 75 % protestant ( lutheran ) , 1 % orthodox and maybe 0,25 % catholic . 
  according to a recent poll , about a half of the lutherans ( 37 % of all finns ) would actually claim to believe in a lutheran concept of god when asked . 
  the schisms between the major denominations do n't generally play a role in the politics , but there are tensions inside the lutheran church ( between conservatives and liberals , and there 's also the matter of evangelical groups ( her\u00e4tysliikkeet ) operating inside of the lutheran church ) , and those do occasionally show up ( generally when christian democrats get in the news ) . 
  prime minister of finland belongs to a conservative evangelical group and the foreign minister is a catholic , and both occasionally get bashed for it ( bringing out the fact that there is indeed some latent anti-catholicism , in the latter case ) . 
  ( not to defend either our lousy pm or fm , of course . ), 
  best : welfare state . 
  worst : the cold . 
  irc . 
  being in a cottage at the lake country ( east finland ) at summer . 
  there 's a variety of different european nationalisms . 
  there 's the liberal kind of federalist pro-eu nationalism , for instance , though they would be pretty loath to call it nationalism , and then you have the far-right `` defend europe ( from muslims , africans , commies etc. ) '', 
  type of european identity politics , and then there 's the vague understanding most people have that there is indeed something that connects us , which is most evident when there 's a lot of europeans somewhere else ( exchange students in us , for instance ) . 
  most people who have nationalist feelings would be nationalist towards their own countries , though . 
  young people tend to feel more european than old people , but this really varies between countries . 
  here in the nordics , single eu goverment is not really popular at all ( i think at some poll like 2 % of finns would support it ) . 
  zizek is a bit of a meme in certain lefty circles . 
  i 'm a translator , and indian translation companies tend to be * the worst * . 
  it 's a neat orderly country you generally do n't have to think a lot about since it 's not in the eu and so on . 
  some people admire their direct democracy . 
  germany , i would guess . 
  finns tend to think of the whole european empires thing as someone else 's business . 
  ... a phrase that middle-class westerners use to describe themselves to feel sophisticated ? 
  i do n't think it has much content beyond that . 
  that 's what we have the asylum-processing instances to figure out for . 
  no , that 's still the most probable reading of your comment . 
  you are welcome to explain what you mean if it is n't . 
  right to seek asylum is a human right , and that is concretely what is being discussed here . 
  it 's not specifically about believing that it 's a good thing that muslims seek asylum ( in an ideal world no-one would need to do so ) , but that they should have an equal right as everyone else . 
  holding conservative / `` traditional '' values does not mean you can not be persecuted . 
  but it is . 
  the borders are n't open , they will not be open , and only a small , powerless minority of people would support making them open in the sense that anyone could move from anywhere to anywhere and stay there without any border checks or possibilities to stop them at the border . 
  whatever one might think about the desirability of such a world , them 's the facts . 
  of course i am aware that when people say ` open borders ' they usually just mean ` more immigration than i 'd want ' , but its still a completely misleading term . 
  like , i have been active in left-wing politics for quite some time and have not met anyone whose thinking that model would describe in any a way .
