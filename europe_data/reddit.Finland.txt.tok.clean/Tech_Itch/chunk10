  and doing that would make all of us as members of ostensibly democratic societies much worse people than some gropey or rapey guy that ends up coming in with the refugees . 
  our only option is to think about how to best integrate the refugees , or to at least give their case for an asylum a fair look before we send them back to whatever waits them . 
  makes sense . 
  i myself got an it degree through a similar program at one point , with the intention of being able to support myself while i study in university . 
  i did get paid a bit better though , because of the line of business , and my pre-existing references . 
  that does make more sense . 
  since when is cherrypicking individual disturbances around the whole of europe , and people just being people , with the apparent goal of painting every refugee/immigrant with the same brush , being `` for sustainable immigration policy '' ? 
  this sub has been mostly `` look at this refugee being a dick !, 
  see what they 're doing to our beautiful continent ? 
  \\* sniff * '' at best , and `` let me just misrepresent this article that tries to actually talk about the challenges with the mass movement of refugees responsibly as some kind of indictment against all refugees '' at worst , for the past few months . 
  it 's beginning to be challenging to find all the useful posts in the middle of all the moral panic about the evil musulmen destroying `` our christian culture '' with their rape brigades and welfare leeching . 
  yep . 
  but if you 've used all your savings to get to germany in the first place , you probably wo n't afford to live for 3 years on , say 600 $ / month . 
  [ here 's some cost of living data on hamburg ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=germany&amp;city=hamburg ) for example . 
  a typical rent for a single bedroom apartment outside the city center seems to be around 560 $ . 
  that does n't leave much for food , clothes or utilities . 
  on first glance this whole apprenticeship thing seems like a rip-off , no matter if you 're a native or an immigrant . 
  or it 's primarily meant for kids living with their parents . 
  it 'd be easier to comment if there was an english translation available for the article , of course . 
  the low pay would make more sense if the cost of living was partly paid by the apprenticeship program , for example . 
  at its largest , the nsdap had over 8 million members . 
  when you give millions of people 10 + years to do horrible nazi things , there 's going to be a lot of it . 
  no doubt there 's unfortunately a lot more still undiscovered . 
   did the alt-right discover a new stick to beat people with orr . . ? 
  yes and no . 
  it 's a [ completely useful term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/signalling_theory ) , but like all language , it can be misused . 
  it seems to be in vogue for people all around the political field to cherry pick scientific terms to use as a bludgeon in everyday debates in an attempt to lend an air of authority to their arguments . 
  it happens with `` virtue signalling '' and alt-right , and the more extreme left and `` privilege/oppression '' alike . 
  both terms have completely legitimate uses in an academic setting , but simplify human interactions to a ludicrous degree when applied to some random person . 
  virtue signalling for example is n't automatically conscious or even negative . 
  you can be both displaying sincere grief and unconsciously signalling that you care about other people 's grief at the same time . 
  i see . 
  yup , just like vegans are aliens from the planet vega ... 
   i was too used to finnish newspapers who are n't really allowed to take political sides i 'm sorry ... what ? 
  yeah , i have to agree with madnessinteractive . 
  you either do n't read finnish newspapers that much or do n't know how the press is supposed to work . 
  [ finland is currently number 1 ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) on rsf 's press freedom index . 
  how the hell can you say that the press is n't `` allowed '' to write about politics here ? 
  they just mostly do it in openly biased manner where it 's supposed to be done by a healthy press : in marked editorial pieces instead of the articles . 
  even then there are publications that openly support some political party , like demari for the socdems , nykyp\u00e4iv\u00e4 for the national coalition party and suomenmaa for the centre party . 
  these might have more neutral reporting style than the typical newspaper in the anglo-saxon world , but while their reporting is usually pretty objective , they do pick stories that support their politics , and the editorial content is often openly slanted towards their party . 
  it actually used to be customary in the past when quoting these kinds of papers in other media to add a disclaimer saying something like `` thatpoliticalpaper is the [ primary media voice ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_suomalaisten_puolueiden_p%c3%a4%c3%a4-%c3%a4%c3%a4nenkannattajista ) of somepartyorother '' . 
  as for the uk press , on that one i agree . 
  it 's a veritable tornado of poopsmithery . 
  when the press does n't like you there , apparently even [ eating a sandwich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ed_miliband_bacon_sandwich_photograph ) in a way they do n't like makes you a horrible excuse for a human being . 
  scotland can into nordic ? 
  that remains to be seen . 
  automation in increasing productivity in the old democracies and freeing people from tasks that would require manual labor in less developed countries . 
  at the same time increasing education in the developing countries is globally increasing the demand for democratization and improved human rights . 
  it might well be that our 6 % has to face a much less bleak world in the future . 
   that 's over-interpretating what i 've said , which is a simple fact , that undemocratic societies are having higher population growths . 
  well , i had to respond to what you wrote , instead of what you thought you wrote , since i 'm not a mind reader . 
  besides , `` undemocratic societies are having higher population growths '' is kind of obvious , since undemocratic societies tend to have worse education , and education has the tendency to decrease birth rates . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you were trying to say , unless it 's some version of `` omfg the mooslims are taking over !!! '', 
  again . 
  the worldwide trend is actually that because of the improving education and living standards , birth rates have [ taken a dive ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in ) all over the world in the past 50 years . 
  it 's actually projected that in the next 50 years worldwide birth rates will again be almost halved . 
   liberal societies are dying out , conservative societies are growing - and not following the democratic ideology . 
  that 's certainly the wet dream of the `` neo-reactionaries '' and people of similar persuasion who 've materialized seemingly everywhere after the turn of the millenium . 
  and every single one somehow seems convinced that once feodalism supposedly makes a glorious comeback , they themselves will be among the new nobility , and not just one of the serfs suffering under their heel . 
  there 's a small part of me that wants to see these people get their harsh dose of reality in the hands of some new glorified dictator 's secret police , but the fact is that despite its messiness and inefficiency , we all ** need ** democracy to protect ourselves from each other . 
  if there was a buyer 's guide for political systems , the number one advice would probably be `` keep in mind when choosing your system that one day you might become one of the ` undesirables ' '' . 
  i loved the music on the other hand . 
  i was always glued to the tv waiting for it . 
  they released the series on dvd here in finland in 2005 and i had to buy them for my godchildren , obviously . 
  i did n't watch them myself , so i have no idea if the the dvds had the original bach music though . 
  i guess they figured mocking swedes was getting old . 
  we 've probably been doing it since the iron age , after all . 
  here 's an oldie , but goodie : what do you call a piece of paper with `` turn over '' written on both sides ? 
  a swedish perpetual motion machine . 
  looks like these are n't the accounts most followed from inside the country . 
  it just counts total followers . 
  so most of these people could be fairly unknown locally . 
  tbh , i have no idea if twitter even has a public api in the first place that would allow you to sort an account 's followers by country . 
  which is even better , to be honest . 
  `` see this shit i put up with ? '', 
  oh right , i guess you could work in the booming tourism industry . 
  pretty much the only husky thing in lapland are the people . 
  i 'm pretty sure one of the commercial channels experimented with having a `` weather girl '' in the 90s , but gave up because of negative viewer feedback . 
  aaand it 's snowing right now . 
  hereditary monarchy could n't be farther from socialism . 
  people ** in general ** like monarchies for the same reason many americans voted for trump : they like having a `` born leader '' - father figure tell them how to do things , without the ambiguity and confusion of parlamentarianism . 
  european constitutional monarchies do n't really give much direct power to their monarchs anymore , but they still project the air of `` authority , respectability and stability '' many people crave . 
  in the uks case , theirs [ do have actual political power ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9801835/queen-and-prince-charles-using-power-of-veto-over-new-laws-whitehall-documents-reveal.html ) , even though it 's not widely known or acknowledged . 
  you 'll notice especially `` stability '' come up in many supportive comments here . 
  that 's the fear of the apparent chaos of democracy talking right there . 
  the same tendency that drives people to `` look up to their royals for moral support during times of crisis '' like many write in these comments is the same tendency that makes people vote for political `` strongmen '' who offer easy apparent answers to difficult questions . 
  hopefully humanity as a species can get rid of it at some point , but i seriously doubt it 'll be anytime soon . 
   you jelly ? 
  funnily enough , in real life that phrase and its equivalents seem to be most commonly used by people who 're defending some monumentally stupid life decision they 've made . 
  the kind of election where the winner gets a cool title , and not much else . 
  much of the power invested to the finnish president by the constitution has been stripped away in the recent years , and it 's more of a ceremonial position . 
  yes , in that they are easily led , full of unfocused anger , and have morally conservative , jingoistic ideas that can snowball into ** bad stuff ** ^ tm however , most of them have no concept of how politics work , are full of unrealistic expectations and widely differing goals . 
  so the most likely end result is that the `` true finns '' will fragment in to smaller , less dangerous groups , now that they actually have to state their opinions publicly . 
  still , it 's a fucked up state of things . 
  hey , mythical past greatness is ** mythical ** . 
  that 's the genius of it . 
  and we do have [ current greatness ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqqhqsbe6fw ) . 
  notice the almost mediterranean use of sign language ... 
  `` regular finns '' would be even more accurate .
