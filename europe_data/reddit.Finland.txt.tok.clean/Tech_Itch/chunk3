  and they make ** a lot ** of noise about it . 
  much of what they rail against is just people saying things that are in no way reflection of what their true attitudes towards the opposite gender are . 
  fuck , i 'm sure some of them are even willing to give me flak for just there innocently implying that there are only two genders , even though i did it just to shorten the already tl ; dr text . 
  of course some of them would be . 
  people are assholes . 
  but does that justify srs 's schtick that `` reddit_sux '' and that we 're all complicit in it , being `` racist , sexist , cis , ableist '' scum ? 
  they seem to have mellowed down quite a bit since i last visited though . 
  some of the threads there actually seem to have reasonable complaints . 
  that hardly justifies the existence of the subreddit to me . 
  yes , i have visited it . 
  and it does n't look like the shithole it used to be . 
  but it 's still worthless . 
  looks like they 're sticking to policing things like the use of the word `` cunt '' , and this [ poor individual 's attempt to make light of a bad situation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1w0umy/while_performing_my_manly_duties/cexokou ) now . 
  looks like they occasionally find a racist comment in a bigger subreddit that has n't been downvoted to oblivion . 
  so that 's kinda nice for them . 
  i 'm a social democrat and it pains me that those fuckwads are associated with the left in any way . 
  the purpose of social justice should be to increase the * equality of opportunity * , not * equality of outcome * . 
  and it ca n't be advanced by designating roughly 50 % of the population as the oppressors and trying to arbitrarily guilt-trip random members of that 50 % at every opportunity to gain invisible points . 
  given that the nazis killed [ 220 000 - 1 500 000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos ) of them , i do n't think they 'd want to see it as a competition . 
  part of the other 6 million often forgotten when talking about the nazi genocide . 
  what the hell is there to `` criticize '' about gays ? 
  that 's like criticizing left-handed people . 
  * `` i have nothing against left-handed people , but it kind of bothers me how they write with their left hand so blatantly in public like that . 
  why ca n't they do that in private ? 
  '' * * `` what if they turn our kid left-handed ? 
  '' * * `` if left-handed people get to marry , it will destroy the sanctity of marriage forever !, 
  me and margaret wo n't feel sacred drinking our morning coffee anymore !, 
  out of curiosity , what kind of `` pc bullshit '' you 'd figure you are typically calling out ? 
  i just sometimes find that some people dismiss having empathy , or being a generally decent human being as `` being pc '' . 
   preserving european culture ? 
  what ? 
  how do you do that ? 
  indeed . 
  there 's no `` european '' monoculture . 
  we have certain shared values , but many of them are shared world-over . 
  people just have different priorities . 
  at the rate that people immigrate here from outside europe , our version of those priorities is under no threat . 
  immigrants with different backgrounds will absorb our values at different rates , but eventually they will . 
  if some of them do n't , that 's a criminal , not a political matter . 
  it seems to me that for many people `` european culture and values '' is an euphemism for christianity . 
  that 's probably why so many of the `` immigration-critical '' people rant about liberals too , since liberals are often perceived to be atheist , or at least indifferent to religion . 
  so it makes sense to a conspiracy-oriented mind to think that muslims and liberals are somehow conspiring , since they both `` oppose christianity '' . 
  * do n't you blaspheme in here !, 
   it is by caffeine alone that i set my mind in motion  it is by the coffee that my thoughts acquire speed  my teeth acquire stains  the stains become a warning  it is by caffeine alone that i set my mind in motion . 
  you probably learned that from a finn . 
  we tend to be self-deprecating , and some finns tend to live with the opinion that anything we do here is n't done `` properly , like they do in country x '' . 
  letting your coffee sit for hours is definitely not normal , and when people make coffee at home , it 's usually drunk right away . 
  and i 'm not sure about how weak the coffee is supposed to be . 
  habitual drinkers build a tolerance to caffeine , so with the massive amounts consumed , you 'd think people would be used to pretty strong coffee . 
  it * is * not unheard of , and a bit of a nationwide joke , that coffee tends to stand on the hot plate for hours in places like petrol stations . 
  the `` petrol station coffee '' in fact keeps getting stronger while sitting there , since the water keeps evaporating away . 
  people sometimes joke that it has the consistency of tar . 
  cafes etc. 
  will make sure you get fresh coffee , however . 
  and unlike the fight club , you 're free to talk about it . 
  in fact , much of your workplace chat will probably center on what stupid/hilarious/weird things happened to you in the tram on the way to work . 
  i think all the nordic countries have a tradition of straw goats as a christmas decoration . 
  they just tend to be a a lot smaller and sit on a shelf or something . 
  i think it 's a pre-christian tradition . 
  before santa claus was introduced in finland , someone would dress up as a goat-headed monster called nuuttipukki , or knut 's / canute 's goat , who would go around the village with a band of followers , demanding beer and food in exchange for leaving the house alone . 
  if none were given , they 'd cause some sort of mischief . 
  and not always good-natured . 
  this is probably why santa claus is called joulupukki in finland , which translates to christmas goat . 
  oh , i 'm sure people have had plenty of reasons throughout the history to vote for those who would restrict their rights . 
  i 'm sure you know that soini is a fairly devout catholic ? 
  and not in the addicted-to-cats way . 
  holy shit . 
  that 's not the least bit okay . 
  to be fair , the `` lol swedes are gay '' thing is playful ribbing for the most part . 
  it 's also anachronistic , in that attitudes towards homosexuals have improved immeasurably in the past few decades , from what i 've seen . 
  i 'm hetero myself , and i have n't been keeping close tabs , but there seem to have been very few , if any hatecrimes against gays in a good while . 
  we have openly gay politicians , one of whom got to the second round of the last presidential election . 
  also , as a personal anecdote , i visited my former hometown , known as a bit backward place , and a bastion of the `` true finns '' , some time back , and i was hit on by two guys in the same evening in a popular mainstream night club . 
  so gays are n't exactly forced to live underground . 
  not sure how your wife 's friend meant it though . 
  maybe she was just jealous ? 
  finland has the biggest percentage of spinsters per capita in the world , iirc . 
  what exactly makes you think that ? 
  the `` swedish vs. finnish '' thing has been going on for hundred years , maybe more , in that the finns think that swedes are silly and effeminate and the swedes think finns are slow and boorish . 
  those are just national stereotypes though , and actually our relations are completely fine . 
  i do n't see what would suggest we 're `` moving away '' from anywhere . 
  just think of it as having your language on hard mode . 
  because the finns find finglish funny too . 
  apparently most albinos have normal colored eyes . 
  some albinos do have pink eyes because of the lack of pigmentation , and since that 's such a visually striking symptom of albinism , you tend to see that on most fictional depictions , in movies , etc. 
  ** looks at the bottom of his glass of water * `` ikea - made in russia '' hmm ... 
  = it 's raining like it came from esteri 's ass . 
  esteri is the finnish form of the female name esther , though it 's rarely used now . 
  no doubt made rarer by the above saying . 
  also , nobody seems to know who that particular esteri was . 
  `` heiluu kuin hullun mulkku '' = ( he/she/it ) flails around like a madman 's cock . 
  that one 's pretty self-explanatory , i think . 
  can be used for both people and things . 
  usually for restless or overly animated people though . 
   many of us view too much signs of national pride as a suresign marker of immaturity in politics and civil society ( whether or not that is correct , i will not comment on ) . 
  it might make german politics less flashy , but i hope it takes away one issue that can distract voters . 
   you might say we fear it , but we do not fear it because it reminds us of germany 's past , in the sense that there 's a sudden flash of guilt . 
  it 's terrifying because some of us understand how quickly it can move from individual pride to social cohesion . 
  and therein lies the danger . 
  that 's a mature view .
