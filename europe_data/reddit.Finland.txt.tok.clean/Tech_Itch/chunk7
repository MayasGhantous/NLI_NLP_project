  they 're more conservative than even the christian democrats , and certainly more right wing than the center party . 
  the conservativeness is what earns them the `` far '' part of the title . 
  if you talk with their supporters in the field , it 's always about furriners , welfare bums or foreign welfare bums . 
  also , they seem to overwhelmingly support the cutting down of public sector . 
  how is that not right wing ? 
  i have this single gun to protect myself against that charging bear , but i kind of wanted an automatic , and it 's a revolver , so i guess i have to ditch it ! '', 
   the only things left to privatize in finland are education and healthcare . 
  we do also have ownership in energy companies , the national airline etc. 
  all of which are important in bringing money to the coffers of the state while there 's constant pressure to reduce taxes . 
  no doubt the privatizers will be busy eroding away that ownership too , as they have been for a good while . 
  after the state has been deprived of all its property , it 'll eventually be at the mercy of private sector loans and potentially dwindling tax income . 
   i 'm pro-privatization of governmental services that could be offered at the same price/quality ratio on the private market well that 's unfortunate . 
  there 's already a plenty of experience about this at municipal level . 
  what seems to happen is that the largest actor in the market will undercut everyone else , selling with a loss if it needs to , and when it 's the sole actor left , it 'll jack up the prices . 
  every competition has a winner , and we should n't have competition in a market where the winner can determine its prize . 
  privatization of essential services is one of my biggest fears with the next government . 
  i always figured that 's the intention . 
  as in , `` a finn would obviously vote for the finns party '' . 
  as opposed to all those `` fake finns '' who do ? 
  of course it still oh-so-cleverly implies that anyone who does n't support them is n't an actual finn , but probably some sort of a 5th columner . 
  this same youth organization sent a delegation to the us republican party 's national convention during the 2012 us presidential election , to `` voice their support for the election of mitt romney '' . 
  so yeah , they 're conservative as hell . 
  all the coalition parties [ are pretty much right-wing authoritarian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fra3he1.png ) . 
  for the non finnish speaking readers , ps = `` the finns party '' , kok = national coalition party , kesk = center party . 
  the axises should be pretty self-evident . 
  they have several members and mps like jussi niinist\u00f6 , juho eerola and jussi halla-aho who belonged to an ultra-nationalist organization that promotes `` racial and cultural separation '' , `` cultural purity '' and [ according to their 2000 agenda ] ( http://suomensisu.fi/vanhinperiaateohjelma.pdf ) , opposed `` unnatural mixing of peoples '' , which sounds to me like just an euphemism for opposing miscegenation . 
  they only resigned from it after their membership became public knowledge , and allegedly timo soini told them to . 
   as far as i know , soini & co. are mostly against immigrants that will live on social security benefits . 
  so they say , but if you talk with their supporters in the field , especially in the south-eastern part of the country , it 's mainly about skin color . 
  his biggest political strength is that it 's impossible to draw a caricature of him . 
  well , it 's likely that they 'll have the jingoistic `` true '' finns as a counter-balance in the government , so hopefully the end result will be something resembling sane . 
  so they did . 
  :d and yeah , neither the ministry of ecology or the society of finnish naturists , which apparently exists , had heard of it . 
  sorry to be the bringer of bad news , but there 's nothing in the local media about this here . 
  this sounds like something the yellow press would be quick to pick up , if there were any facts behind the article . 
  i 'm sure the ecology minister will have a nice , hearty chuckle about this if the ministry is ever contacted . 
  for one thing , it 's still a beach , so it 's effect on the environment wo n't be changing , which means that it 's outside their portfolio . 
  secondly , it 's in a goddamn ** foreign country ** . 
  this particular one also happens to have a long history of getting extra pissy at any suggestions on how to manage their environment . 
  so there is n't exactly much they can do . 
  still , i ca n't help feeling kind of bad if the part about a bunch of naturalists losing their beach is true . 
  that bit at least sounds plausible in the current state of russia 's internal politics . 
  should have been pretty easy , since the whole country was searching . 
  from the news piece :  with analysts suggesting it marked a shift back towards soviet military planning . 
  so it looks more like a possible sign of a new cold war coming up . 
   '' ... so the point of the show was to take these really well known sports figures and put them in really adverse situations to see if they can survive '' http://i.imgur.com/56wbh0i.gif, 
  yet for finland , it 's a small problem in the grand scheme of things . 
  the influx of refugees is in a scale that 's never-before-seen , but that does n't mean it 's unmanageable or that it 'll somehow mean major changes in finnish society . 
  i 'd be more worried about the current government trying to shut down or privatise public services . 
  times are economically tough here too , and people are looking for someone to blame for their feeling of uncertainty about the future . 
  there are always cynics who are willing to exploit that for their own advantage . 
  which is exactly the case with vigilante groups too . 
  plus , they do n't have appropriate training to handle things , or the equipment or sources of information that the police have . 
  you also have no idea how they 'll react , and whether they bother to find out if there was a crime in the first place and who commited it . 
  they might also have motives other than keeping the peace , like it seems with the `` street patrols '' that have seemed to pop up here in finland recently . 
  thanks for the links , but i meant the particular models they 're planning on using . 
  i do know there are plenty of working ekranoplans in existence . 
  or are these by the same company they 're planning to order theirs from ? 
  do the planes actually exist at this point ? 
  the video you linked to only seems to show 3d models . 
  pretty much . 
  it 's really weird to read the uk metro , which seems to be full of celeb news and sensationalistic bullshit like this . 
  ours has serious news and some culture , and has completely different tone . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the first message in the image [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/liamutlr/status/698581550842146816/photo/1 ) links to . 
  he calls the refugees `` rapists '' and `` rats '' and implies some kind of vigilantism happening against the whole group if any member of it commits a crime . 
  the uk `` communications act '' might be scarily vague , but to be honest , what the guy said looks like it would qualify as ethnic agitation under the finnish criminal law too . 
  he 's vilifying , dehumanizing and threatening a whole group of people just because they 're refugees . 
  the longer comment in the image he linked to , more likely . 
  nope , that 's just the reply by someone else . 
  it 's probably the first guy in the picture he linked to : http://i.imgur.com/k2ucvml.jpg the guy is claiming the refugees are `` on the prowl '' , as if they 're rapists hunting for victims . 
  he 's also apparently threatening them with possible vigilantism if any one of them commits a crime , while calling them `` rats '' . 
  this would probably qualify as ethnic agitation under the finnish criminal law too . 
  yeah , we all know what he meant , including merkel . 
  it 's just that you can use distasteful metaphors that end up demeaning a part of your audience even when you mean well . 
  40 % of all christians are n't catholic . 
  the pope 's theological status to them is probably on average something like `` just some guy who thinks he has god 's phone number '' . 
  it was voluntary . 
  childlessness might not be for merkel . 
  yle has multiple copies of the video with intact audio available on their site . 
  it 's in finnish , but you can still spot the word `` asylum '' in the ingress of the story . 
  that 's some shitty censorship right there . 
  if this was actual censorship anyway , our dailies would have an absolute field day with it , and whoever did it would be hung out to dry . 
  this is n't the fucking north korea . 
  you just do n't censor ** the president 's speech ** without the press noticing . 
   those that do not know , the speech got censored by our state funded broadcasting team . 
  no it did n't , ye nutter . 
  yle 's site has multiple copies available with the full audio . 
  besides , if they 'd censor something as visible as this , the dailies would absolutely flip their shit , and the whos and whys would be front page news for months . 
  was the guy bitten by the horse or something ? 
  also , i 'm guessing that within 2 hours that photo is in / r/wtf . 
  thanks . 
  that seems like an useful dataset . 
  i was looking for more recent information , as that 's from 2014 , but it does tell us a lot already . 
  if you look at the other nationalities , like iraqis , iranians or syrians , they 're more evenly distributed around finland . 
  it looks like the somalis are a some kind of a fluke in that respect . 
  if you look at the [ syrians ] ( http://pxnet2.stat.fi/pxweb/pxweb/fi/statfin/statfin__vrm__vaerak/045_vaerak_tau_200_fi.px/table/tableviewlayout1/?rxid=179254b1-a834-4f73-8d72-cd7c64fdfdc8 ) for example , about 40 % of them live in uusimaa . 
  still , going through the nationalities most represented in the refugees , i did n't find a single group where `` the very vast majority '' lived in helsinki . 
  these percentages are no doubt also affected by the fact that the population of finland is already heavily concentrated to uusimaa , as around 30 % of the population lives there , and the fact that before last year 's influx of asylum seekers , they typically entered the country through southern finland and uusimaa , so they 'd tend to stay there . 
  of course you also need to keep in mind that uusimaa is a lot bigger than just helsinki , and you can find much cheaper rental apartments around the province . 
  [ here 's actually a handy chart ] ( https://www.google.com/fusiontables/datasource?docid=1z2jc4iwtyj3snos_exhxv4ygwlzvro5za0mdm_k ) i found with average rents around the country .
