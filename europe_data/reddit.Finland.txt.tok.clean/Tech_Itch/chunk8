  rents in helsinki are n't that nasty if you look at just one room apartments , but if you have multiple rooms , they quickly shoot up . 
  still , you can rent a single room apartment for 2/3 of what you pay in helsinki elsewhere in uusimaa . 
  and even in helsinki , refugees tend to be concentrated in low income areas , where rents tend to be lower than average . 
   the very vast majority of refugees live in areas with so expensive rents . 
  roughly [ 3200 ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/joka_kolmas_turvapaikanhakija_asuu_uudellamaalla__katso_asuinpaikat_kartalta/8449935 ) ( 5600 if you count the neighboring municipalities with higher-than-average but still lower rents ) of the current 25300-ish asylum * seekers * live in helsinki . 
  i could n't find statistics saying either way , but you 'd assume that the majority of people with asylum wo n't be moving around that much in a still unfamiliar country once they 've settled down . 
  at least initially . 
  if you have reliable statistics saying otherwise , i 'd be interested in seeing them . 
  you using helsinki , which has the most expensive rents in the country , often 2x or 3x of most of the rest of the country , as the example is pretty disingenious , since the vast , vast majority of the unemployed people with asylum would n't be getting anywhere near that amount of money as aid for rent . 
  so your claim that `` every refugee '' gets $ 1,100 has no basis on reality . 
  even then , the social services will only pay 80 % of your rent , and if you have a rent so big that you 'd get $ 650 , they wo n't be paying it for too long before you 'll be `` kindly suggested '' to get a smaller and/or cheaper apartment . 
  besides , you 'll have to pay everything that goes over that $ 650 from the basic social security , so you wo n't exactly be living like a king . 
  also , none of this is `` without conditions '' . 
  you 'll have to have a valid reason to get social security benefits . 
  you 're expected primarily to look for work or education . 
  ** and , of course all of this only concerns the [ roughly 25 % ] ( http://www.migri.fi/about_us/statistics/statistics_on_asylum_and_refugees ) of the asylum seekers who actually get an asylum . 
  ** which was around 1800 people last year . 
   and every refugee is paid $ 1,100 a month without conditions in finland , so life is already relatively good even if you do n't work . 
  [ that 's absolute , unmitigated bullshit . 
  ] ( http://www.pakolaisneuvonta.fi/index_html?lid=90 ) if you 're an asylum seeker , you 'll get just under 300 euros per month , which you have to buy food , clothes and other necessities with . 
  if you 're granted an asylum , you 'll get normal social security/unemployment benefits until you can find work . 
  with / r/europe being in the state it is , i ca n't tell anymore if this kind of misinformation is malicious or just misinformed . 
  i hope it 's the latter in this case . 
  and ireland is one of those catholic countries . 
  looks like that example you posted talks only about us military veterans . 
  the [ cdc in the us ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ice/ice95v1/c26.pdf ) seems to think international statistics are fairly accurate for developed countries :  for the more developed countries , the evidence presented here indicates that such national data achieve acceptable standards of reliability . 
  i very much doubt many 1st world countries have an aversion to reporting suicides reliably in statistics though . 
  they might get covered up on personal level , of course . 
  especially in catholic countries . 
  well yeah , if you know the lingo the press uses for suicide . 
  every time there are the words `` kuoli \u00e4killisesti kotonaan '' , which translates to `` died suddenly at home '' , in the news , it 's pretty likely that the person being talked about commited suicide . 
  if you 're so panicked about immigration that that will decide who you vote for , you deserve everything you get . 
  unfortunately rest of us get dragged down too with the sinking ship . 
  we in finland are seeing that up close right now , with the populist and anti-foreigner finns party in the governing coalition . 
  they were all `` for the working people '' when they were campaigning , and now they 're shitting on workers with the rest of the right wing parties in the coalition . 
  a couple of tens of thousands of asylum seekers is small potatos compared to the fact that the right wing parties will have a free reign in setting up the laws to favor the employers and big business . 
  they already tried to pass a law to make tax evasion easier for investors , but luckily the plan failed because of the backlash . 
  their next big thing is changing the constitution to limit privacy protections it provides . 
  will be interesting to see what else they might try to sneak in . 
  the same circus will no doubt continue while people are distracted by the scary brown people . 
  `` you 'll get what you order '' , like the finns party 's campaign slogan said during the parliamentary election , funnily enough . 
  to be fair , fast-talking someone into buying a stolen phone is a lot easier if you both have the same native language . 
   these people are running from war yes , but the majority are men not women and children as they present it . 
  what seems to be often forgotten is that it 's also completely logical to send the healthy young man from your family to make a long dangerous trip . 
  ** especially ** when you know that women making the same journey risk being mistreated . 
  if they manage to get asylum when they arrive , they can then apply for family reunification to bring the rest of the family to safety . 
  no doubt there are quite a few economic immigrants among the asylum seekers , but just the above alone tends to skew the arrivals towards young males already . 
  i have to agree . 
  a good bit of investigative journalism there . 
  they managed to interview victims and police officers on the ground too . 
   the far right ** pro whites ** feminists * versus * the regressive left and ** muslims ** ? 
  so , how is this compatible with `` islam is not a race , so hating muslims is n't racism ? '', 
  your real agenda is showing . 
  besides , the muslim immigrants and refugees in europe are far too fragmented and sectarian to form any kind of an army outside the wet dreams of you `` culture warriors '' . 
  right ... `` we had to destroy european culture to save it '' , amiright ? 
   the entire situation looks like a right wing party 's wet dream . 
  which is why the right wing parties should exercise caution before they take everything that 's being said as fact . 
  too often when something seems too good to be true , it actually is . 
   ca n't wait for conspiracy nuts to call it a false flag operation . 
  no need for a grand conspiracy , or false flag - anything . 
  police officers are people too , and they have opinions on politics . 
  some things that were made up to support an individual officer 's personal position could have slipped into that report . 
  obviously , i 'm not attempting to minimize what happened . 
  it 's obvious that multiple things went very wrong . 
  now we just need to determine what they were and make sure that the rule of law will be respected in the future . 
  the helsinki one turned out to be a false tip from people belonging to a different sect than the supposed criminals . 
  turned out to be a false rumor started by people from a different sect than the supposed perpetrators . 
  the police is suggesting that , not huffpo . 
  i 'm well aware that they often like to put their own spin on things , but this does n't look like one of those times . 
  the last time `` german men '' behaved like this was in ww2 . 
  the reason i used the quotes is that it was a small percentage of german men . 
  and this was an even smaller percentage of the male immigrants/refugees in europe . 
  and , if you think the refugee crisis is somehow an actual threat to the german culture , you lack all sense of proportion . 
  germany has 80 + million citizens . 
  they could take many times more refugees and still be the majority in their own country . 
  not that it would make much financial sense . 
   but they count on people like the american you replied to knowing nothing about the legal process . 
  it 's not just americans , to be fair . 
  people do n't tend to know much , or care to know in the first place , in finland either . 
  there are constant rumors about what kind of things and how much money the asylum seekers get from the state , and the concepts of immigrant , refugee and asylum seeker are freely conflated . 
  it does n't even help to correct people , when unfounded rumors heard through a third cousin 's classmate 's coworker are trusted more than the official data . 
  because fear is a handy leash you can use to lead people around . 
  it works everywhere else . 
  why not on the estonians ? 
  well , to be fair , he 's a law student and not a history one ... 
   lion eats 4.5 kg + during winter in sub zero weather ? 
  this particular stork will use more energy than usual just to maintain its body temperature . 
  depends on everyone 's personal threshold for amazement , i guess . 
  of course assad would like to stay in power . 
  given that he is n't exactly the best person to have in power either , i ca n't really blame anyone for not wanting to fight for him . 
  and , secularity is no doubt a good feature to have in a country , but it ca n't be the only benchmark for a society . 
  finland itself had a bloody civil war only twenty years before the winter war , between royalist/capitalist `` whites '' and socialist/communist `` reds '' , where almost a 40 000 people died . 
  over 10 000 of those of hunger and disease in terrible conditions in prison camps . 
  the war left deep scars in the national psyche that lasted well into the 60s/70s and in some ways even further . 
  the only thing that probably saved finland from decades of white repression and possibly a very different future was germany losing wwi , and with that , the influence it had in finland . 
  the white side had to compromise and take the reds back into politics , which gave them a representation and furthered national unity . 
  despite that , small scale repression and attacks on leftists continued until the early 30s when far right activists took the former president k.j. 
  st\u00e5hlberg and his wife to one of their `` drives to the country '' , and began losing support . 
  there was even talk at the time of a possible military coup being planned by army officers who considered the current government too leftist for their tastes . 
  the reason the finns could unite to fight a war only less than a decade after that , is that we had a well defined , external enemy , and we agreed that we were all fighting for the self-determination of the country , despite what side we were on politically .
