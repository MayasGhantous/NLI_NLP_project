  syria on the other hand has dozens of groups with very different goals , none of which seem to be for national unity , or solidarity between ethnic and religious groups . 
   people who are not willing to fight for their country they might well be willing to fight for * this * country . 
  i 've seen plenty of immigrants and children of refugees who 've served honorably in the finnish army . 
  i have the strong impression that many of the refugees want to get into western european countries because they 're ( at least outwardly ) stable , and there 's less risk of having to wake up in the middle of rubble again . 
  when you have something worth defending , you 'll fight for it . 
  also , people will be more willing and able to accept part time and zero-hour contracts , study , to or start a small business themselves , as they have a guaranteed basic income to mitigate the risks . 
  that should have a positive effect on the employment statistics . 
   an opinion ca n't be wrong . 
  huh ? 
  maybe if it 's just something on based on taste , like `` i like the color purple '' . 
  but that 's not the only definition of `` opinion '' . 
  an opinion can also mean a person 's stand on some issue based on their interpretation of the facts . 
  you can have faulty facts or faulty reasoning , which will make your opinion wrong . 
  pretending otherwise is no doubt a good way for a person to shield their mind from ideas that threaten their worldview , but it does n't seem very healthy in the long run . 
  one of the most meaningful parts of a serious conversation can be `` your opinion is wrong , and here 's why ... '', 
  i did have the impression that they 're being replaced , but i figured there might still be a good number of them around in rural areas and older public buildings etc. 
  could the number be affected by the turkish `` elephant 's feet '' toilets where you squat to do your business and then use your hand to clean up ? 
  you 'd obviously want to wash your hands after that , even if you would n't do that after using a western-style toilet . 
  they also sent us 2/3 of their air force , and a massive amount of ammunition , in addition to those 10000 volunteers . 
  some people just like to forget that . 
  it 's probably also that people have the need to find an obvious target for blame , when the reality is that you just ca n't prevent every single attack . 
  so he did :  mr mcdonnell was present at the meeting where the demands were drawn up , despite claims made by his spokesman that he had not seen the letter . 
  hoist by my own petard there . 
  yeah , that makes it more difficult to explain . 
  who knows , maybe he was dicking around with a cell phone during the important parts of the meeting ? 
  `` never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . '', 
  [ relevant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom_moore,_jr . ), 
  looks like a lot of really good stuff , with a generous dollop of pants-on-head stupid points mixed in , like disarming the police and nationalizing companies that have to fire people . 
  also the populist staple of `` mps should only be paid a worker 's wage . '', 
  is there . 
  if you thought that politicians were bought before , that 'd really make sure you did n't even have to wonder anymore . 
  ~ ~ might be that he just took a cursory look at the paper before signing it and did n't notice the weirder bits . ~ ~ edit : * never mind . 
  i just read the article again , and he was present when they came up with the points . 
  well , at least his body was . 
  who knows what happened , but in any case it does n't exactly give a good impression of the guy . 
  because a hate crime is an attack against the whole group who 's the target of the hate , in addition to the individuals targeted . 
  it 's intended to serve as a threat and a warning to the hated group to `` remember their place '' , `` go away or die '' etc. 
  it 's also an attack against the society itself which the targets either belong to , or are under the protection of , as it 's using violence in an attempt to bypass democracy and the rule of law by intimidating those people . 
  or what exactly do you figure would be the motive for , for example , torching a building where only members of a select group are known to live in , while those people are inside ? 
  `` i did n't like the shade of the paint job '' , maybe ? 
  they hate muslims more than jews , which makes them support israel . 
  the `` gay pride parade '' was apparently organized in an effort to piss off the local muslims too , which turned out to not work too well . 
  many people have responded to you saying that sd are a centrist party , but that 's not entirely true . 
  their economic policy is at the center , but they 're deeply morally conservative , nationalistic and xenophobic , which makes them a right wing party . 
  just like their sister party in finland . 
  both parties are even more conservative than the christian morality police parties in both countries . 
  sd also has the additional baggage of initially having been founded by actual , card carrying neo-nazis . 
  that 's a really good point . 
   on a good note , male medical technicians ( unisex nurse title ) are becoming more common . 
  that 's cool to hear . 
  a male friend is studying to be a emergency medical tech , and does generic nursing jobs on the side to get job experience and some money . 
  he 's told me he 's been very well received everywhere he 's worked at . 
   i 've gathered that your solution is to just ask them to integrate and drop their beliefs that are ingrained into their very self image . 
  this will never work and is a fantasy . 
  i have no idea where you gathered that from , but it was n't anywhere near my post , that 's for sure . 
  they should get a fair warning that `` this is how things work here , and you 'll find yourself in a jail or a plane back home if you do n't follow the rules '' . 
  and they are for the most part . 
  i 've talked to the people who run some of the integration courses here myself and was pretty convinced by what they 're doing . 
   you also seem to think that you either machine gun them down at the border or just say fuck it and let everyone and anyone in with no checks . 
  there is a middle ground . 
  i 'll quote myself : * '' ... give their case for an asylum a fair look before we send them back to whatever waits them '' * we 're doing the middle ground thing . 
  at least finland is . 
  background checks are being speeded up , and we 've built centers for quickly processing the asylum seekers . 
  there are talks on exporting that model to other eu countries . 
  also , if you close the borders and only allow a small select group through , we 'll end up like the us with a large amount of undocumented people who 've arrived through smuggling , with all the unfortunate side effects of that . 
  it 's much more clean to take the people in out in the open , so they can be background checked and are easier to track . 
   our money goes further if used to help them elsewhere . 
  this is something that does n't work in reality . 
  let 's look at just my own country as an example : the xenophobic conservative populist party that got their share of power here some time ago might have espoused the idea of `` helping the people at their home country instead of them coming here '' in their election speeches , but one of the first things they cut in their budget was foreign aid . 
   the price for this should not be too high . 
  unfortunately it looks a lot like it is . 
  most european countries do n't have the resources to send their troops to the mediterranean sea , and the larger ones seem to lack the political will . 
  not to mention the questions of how turkey would react , and how we 'd go about stopping all the boats , majority of which will probably be hard to detect before they hit the ground on the european side , without filling the whole sea with naval hardware . 
  and when you 're faced with desperate people who 've traveled for long distances and have very little to lose , actually physically stopping them might again be a question of whether you want to use the machine gun or not . 
  many of them would no doubt figure that the risk of getting shot at the eu border is preferable to almost certainly being shot at in their home country . 
  there 's also no way to give a `` comprehensive statement '' that would be heard by everyone . 
  nor would it have much effect on people desperate enough . 
  or maybe equality feminists should kick out the crazies before they co-opt the whole movement ? 
  the problem with people in general is just this , to quote a thinker , not a ** great ** thinker , but a thinker none the less , donald rumsfeld : * `` you go to war with the army you have , not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time . 
  '' * iow : you need numbers to affect change , and people often think that it 's safer to keep the crazies around so that you can show that you have those numbers , even if you have to put up with their craziness . 
  it does if you think about gender equality as a subset of equality in general . 
  humanists might just be a too disorganized of a group to fight for any single group 's rights under a single banner . 
  tell me about it . 
  i had to buy block-out curtains so that the eye of sauron over there does n't bother me when i try to sleep ... 
  ffs , and ** this ** is how i learn about fry leaving qi ? 
  regardless of who 's going to replace him , to me that show without stephen fry is like the colbert report without stephen colbert ... 
  i was positively impressed myself when our local foreign ministry was looking for male diplomats some time ago , because their diplomat cadre was too female-dominated . 
  gender quotas might not be the ideal solution , but when you have to use them , at least people seem commited to have them work both ways . 
  women get conditioned to fear all men if they get raped or otherwise hurt by one , and will apparently feel unsafe if there are men even in the adjacent room . 
  publicly doubting the healthiness of this for their psyche will get you only outrage as a response . 
  that 's why you ca n't have a rape center that serves both genders . 
  and women get the priority , since they 're commonly portrayed as the `` victim gender '' , and men as the `` perpetrator gender '' . 
  not at all , no . 
  on the other hand , if you 'd claim that those two things are n't already happening for the most part , and that the immigrants are somehow getting coddled and their crimes getting covered up ** as a rule ** by the powers that be , that 'd make you sound like someone on the far right . 
  there 's going to be some percentage of antisocial people and economic immigrants among the refugees . 
  the difference in how you approach the problem . 
  let 's say that for example , it turns out that some percentage of male refugees have a dismissive attitude towards women , and there have been proportionally more cases of sexual harassment by them compared to the native population : if your line of thought after hearing the above is that this is a unsolvable , built-in problem with the refugees , and the best option to solve the issue is to stop them at the borders of europe , with violence if need be , you 're probably on the far right of the political spectrum , or to be charitable , possibly intentionally have been misinformed about the situation by said far righters . 
  one the other hand , if your line of thought is something to the effect of `` how can we best make extremely clear to newly arrived refugees that women have equal rights and responsibilities compared to men in western societies , and that is to be respected ? 
  '' , you 're probably approaching the whole thing in a more levelheaded way . 
  it 's already pretty clear that we ca n't just stop the mass movement of refugees towards europe , short of just machinegunning them down at the border .
