how is he a dick ? 
  from what i 've seen of him , he is one of the more likable characters in finnish politics . 
  i 'm better at admitting what went wrong than our politicians . 
  nokia is epitome of what is wrong with finland . 
  i 'd explain that in detail but this is a bit off-topic . 
  apple is n't at fault here , all they did was provide good products people want to buy . 
  in finland , [ kalevala ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevala ) ( our national epic ) is a good source of mythology . 
  [ tuoni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuoni ) for example is the god of the underworld ( `` god of death '' ) . 
  [ otso ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otso ) , `` the king of the forest '' ( a spirit ) . 
  give it a read , if you are up for some 19th century poetry !, 
  `` how did we get here ? '', 
  - `` one step at a time '' . 
  the current russia has been years and years in making . 
  people just have been ignoring the signs . 
  increasing silencing of all opposition . 
  tight leash on all media , or in other words , increasing nationalistic propaganda . 
  no dissent allowed . 
  general prevalence of corruption and crime . 
  try to gain energy indepedence from russia , lessen the dependence on russian markets . 
  keep the military strength up and equipment up-to-date so that any attempted military operation against us is more trouble than it 's worth . 
  perhaps even consider joining nato , but * only * after the first two points have been solved . 
  . . or that 's what i 'd do . 
  what our dear leaders will do is a whole another matter . 
  `` troll farms '' . 
  it 's funny to see that the internet lingo has spread so far , even though it 's often not used in the correct context . 
  you ca n't force market like that . 
  if companies see profit in russia , they will take it . 
  the situation wo n't change for a while . 
  some companies have cancelled investments , or put them on hold , food companies are searching alternative markets because of the food ban etc. 
  but these are all reactions to crisis , not pre-planned actions . 
  i think [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) is accurate term here . 
  this is all about the fact that we are a tiny country neighboring a ( semi - ? ) superpower . 
  politicians have to be very careful about voicing opinions conflicting with russias agenda . 
  in the dark back rooms we plan better military defense , think that more nato bases are good and distrust russia , but publicly we ca n't really voice that . 
  best tactic for keeping our independence and western lifestyle is to be as neutral as possible . 
  or in other words , seeming like a non-threat non-issue country . 
  nato membership will only be possible if we can accept the economic consequences , which most likely will be total and complete shutdown of trade between finland and russia . 
  this would be a huge problem , because russia is finlands biggest trading partner ( or one of the biggest ) . 
  with the deal , it 's like karjala for finns during ww2 . 
  it does n't matter what the circumstances were , the area is russias . 
  without a deal , it 's still officially ukraines , russia would be an invading foreign force and it could be used as a political weapon on world stage . 
  i 'm wondering if the increasing pressure from ~ ~ russian ~ ~ rebel military forces has forced ukraine to make a deal of some kind they did n't want . 
  perhaps they are giving up crimea to russia , officially ? 
  and provide free passage there by land ? 
  time will tell what the terms of the deal are , but my guts are telling me that ukraine was forced to an unfavorable deal , or risk losing the whole eastern part of country .

  happy yes , rich no . 
  finns are not rich but neither are we extremely poor . 
  homelessness is very rare here for example . 
  here in finland buying a new car is a luxury , or something you can do at an older age . 
  buying an old car is the financially sound decision , as there are plenty of other money sinks around : * rising taxes * rising house and rental prices * rising food prices * ever-rising rising gas prices * rising prices for < any item you can think of  * stagnant waves . 
  oh right , some very high profile people want to * lower * wages here personally , i 'm 28 and i have never owned a car . 
  i just never had the money to buy a 10 000 + euro thing . 
  and my pay is ~ 10e higher than national median pay . 
  i 'm saving money for a car right now , but i 'll be lucky if i have my first car before age 30 . 
  i never really needed a car so i did n't buy any of the few thousand euro cr * p-piles . 
  good thing public transports are good here in finland . 
  if that 's the truth then i do n't see how they could be jailed legally , but that does n't mean they would n't if what they said could be seen as slander ( even if what was said was truth ) . 
  i understand that media has to be more civil and neutral than your average person . 
  but if media is n't saving any ammo when firing at `` true finns '' , why would they sweep all other issues like `` higher than average crime rate in demographic x '' under the rug ? 
  i 'm not saying demographic x is at fault here , i 'm saying we have mishandled the situation and we could help root out the causes for this ( too little education possibilities ? 
  help getting over language barrier ? 
  etc. ), 
  if we just could identify the issue first . 
  right now the media discussion is limited to articles like `` people of demographic y are accepted less than average into jobs '' . 
  which makes it sound like employers are racist , when in fact demographic y is from a very poor country where education possibilities are scarce . 
  how could they possible compete with natives ( or immigrants from other countries ) who have had high-tech education at their disposal ? 
  but the article and even expert statements are chosen so that natives are portrayed as racist , and that the racism is where all the issues come from . 
  thus the extreme taboo of not even touching the subject . 
  `` taboo '' is closer to the truth . 
  in finland the issue is that if you start talking about stuff like problems with integrating war refugees , people will associate you with `` true finns '' faster than you can snap your fingers . 
  to understand that you have to understand the public image of `` true finns '' here in finland : they are seen as angry , racist , dumb country folk . 
  i 'm not saying they are , but that 's how `` true finns '' are seen . 
  i would love to start a discussion about the fact that we seem to be taking in all these war refugees from african civil wars ( for example ) , and about that i believe our society does n't do enough effort towards integrating them . 
  or perhaps about the problem of `` beggars '' who come from a certain country/area , who at least some have been suspected of being part of criminal organisations . 
  they fly in , stay for the summer to beg , then fly back home for the rest of the year . 
  try to have discussions about these subjects , and you get immediately get marked as racist , or they will brush the subject aside `` yeah its fine , no need to do anything '' . 
  correct . 
  in scandinavia its forbidden to say anything that may put non-white people in a bad light , or to criticize in any way , so news have codewords like `` youths '' for these situations . 
  and with this attitude the world * will * stay the same . 
  you need to be angry about wrongdoings , not just accept them passively . 
  let 's hope bombs going off in greece/other debt-troubled nations is not going to be the norm . 
  i agree , it should be considered an utility . 
  for * everyone * ? 
  impossible for the rural areas , unless you are going to throw massive amounts of money at the problem . 
  but this plan is a good thing . 
  for me internet is one of the most important sources of information . 
  i found my current job ( permanent position , been working for 2 years and counting ) through internet application , i pay my bills through internet , i watch tv through internet streaming services , i download digital games , i get my music from spotify etc. 
  you get the picture . 
  if everyone has access to decent internet , then we can do better services based on that fact . 
  but it does require ( near ) 100 % penetration . 
  i hope this succeeds . 
  * edit * - i hope you all are right , i 'd be very glad if this is no longer an effort that requires tons of money . 
   bankrupt banks bankrupting nations ` cos of the single currency would be more accurate . 
  still not seeing how this makes the crisis germanys , finlands or netherlands fault . 
   well , whose responsibility is the 50 % greek bond write down ? 
  christ . 
  there is a reason why greek bonds had skyrocketing interest rates . 
  it was highly unlikely they could pay it all back . 
  no-one forced cyprus to buy greek bonds .
