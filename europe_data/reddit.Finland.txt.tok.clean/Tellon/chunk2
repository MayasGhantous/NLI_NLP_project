  you invest into bonds , you are taking a conscious risk . 
  once again i fail to see how it 's `` norther europes '' fault that your banks went all-in on greek . 
   that 's not why cypriot banks are in trouble . 
  right , sorry . 
  i was mistaken . 
  only other reason i 've read is that cyprus banks went `` all-in '' on greek bonds and took losses from those . 
  if i 'm wrong this time , please tell what is the correct answer . 
  not northern europe 's fault if cyprus banks gamble on greece , with the whole country on the table . 
   can everybody get off their moral high ground around here and do some bloody research ? 
  `` northern '' rhetoric is no better than `` southern '' rhetoric . 
  get your shit together . 
  my so-called `` high horse '' here is asking to take responsibility . 
  we in finland have been constantly cutting back , increasing taxes etc. 
  to keep ourselves float . 
  beggars ca n't be choosers , bankrupt nations . 
  `` joint responsibility '' is a fun concept to throw around when you are having bad times , and then forget when times turn good . 
  look at greece for example : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8509244.stm you do n't pay taxes --  government does n't have money . 
  i 'm shocked !, 
  and this is eus fault ? 
  is it eus fault that cyprus banks paid interest rates they could n't afford ? 
  google translate link : [ translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fi&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.latribune.fr%2factualites%2feconomie%2funion-europeenne%2f20130321trib000755261%2fl-espagne-veut-aussi-instaurer-une-taxe-sur-les-depots-bancaires.html ) hopefully this trend does n't spread too far . 
  i was being positive ? 
  situation is not good , and may still get worse in short term ( ** cyprus !!, 
  ** ) , but in long term it seems to be going better . 
  better than estimations is a good thing , even if things are still going south . 
  the contagion fears were over the possibility of direct withdrawals from peoples bank accounts . 
  if i government is allowed to take money from my account whenever they want , what will stop them from doing it whenever they want ? 
  eu politicians said that `` greece is a unique situation '' , `` bailout will solve this problem '' and our own politicians said `` we are going to make money from this [ greece ] bailout '' . 
  last time i checked , our losses from greece have been hundreds of millions of euros . 
  so excuse me from not believing that the cyprus direct withdrawals are `` a unique situation '' . 
  i 've heard this talk from politicians so many times before . 
  the option is now on the table and it is only a matter of time before direct withdrawals from bank accounts will be implemented on a more large scale . 
  ** that ** is the fear . 
   the germans , dutch , finnish and brits in particular seem to be using the trouble in southern europe ( even if much of it is their own fault ) to extend their economic power entirely at the expense of an entire generation in spain , portugal and greece ( more to come surely ) . 
  as much as you 'd like it , we ca n't afford to pay for debt . 
  we have our own house to pay for . 
  we have our own families to feed . 
  countries accumulate debt because they cant afford to pay for everything . 
  this is thought to be sustainable `` because future growth will pay for current debt '' . 
  the problem is , politicians see a surplus in budget as something to spend . 
  all surplus is spent , but nothing is ever cut . 
  what is the solution ? 
  take more debt !, 
  * never cut anything * spend all budget surplus on more stuff * when you run out of money , take more debt * oh hey , our balance is positive again !, 
  let 's spend it !, 
  are you starting to see the problem ? 
  now we are supposed to give these same people even more money to spend ? 
  it 's like giving a 2nd mortgage to someone who is about to default on their first mortgage . 
  my opinion is that these `` bailouts '' are not a good thing , they will only delay the inevitable . 
  the real mistake was getting the debt you could n't pay for . 
  please tell me why i 'm wrong , i 'm more than glad to be corrected . 
  `` cyprus is a unique situation '' . 
  i have a very distinct memory that eu ministers said the same thing abou greeces situation . 
  `` it 's unique '' . 
  `` it 's one time thing '' . 
  `` we 'll only bail out this one time '' . 
  my countries government actually said `` we are doing this for profit '' when agreeing on the first greece bailout . 
  my countries losses from greece is now in ** hundreds of millions ** . 
  i have very little faith left in eu government ( s ) at this point . 
  those banks should be nationalized then and be made part of the system . 
  no ** private ** bank can be `` system important '' . 
  the current trend of `` privatize the profits , socialize the losses '' is not a good thing . 
  my advice is to let the banks fall that will fall . 
  if they could n't manage themselves enough to be profitable in past , how can they be trusted in the future ? 
  we have deposit insurance for our money , * right * ? 
  so the small business owner in cyprus should suffer because russians decided to store their money in the country ? 
  they biggest question now remains : how will people react ? 
  if there is a bank run , things might get very bad . 
  it might get worse if all big money accounts get emptied . 
  they are thinking of reducing the robbed amount from ~ 7 % to 3 % for less than 100 000 euro accounts . 
  anything over 0 % is too much in my opinion . 
  taxes are your tool , government , use them . 
  this is what we call `` maan tapa '' ( `` way of the country '' ) . 
  it 's related to our alternative name for corruption : `` hyv\u00e4 veli verkosto '' ( `` good brother network '' ) . 
  shameful . 
  nothing . 
  the `` article '' that was linked is an * opinion * column . 
  http://euobserver.com/justice/119261 this is the real topic of the rant that was linked by op : the fact that romania is n't a popular country to be included in schengen agreement . 
   germany and france later agreed to a phased-in membership , opening up airports and sea ports and keeping the land borders closed ** until more progress is made in fighting graft and organised crime . 
  ** person i answered to , and the opinion linked by op , assumed that it 's because `` romanian people are bad '' . 
  no , it 's because of your problems with organized crime . 
  please do n't try to play the victim here , it 's not about race or migration . 
  unless you are talking about criminals migrating . 
  western eu companies pay you , right ? 
  the price you asked , right ? 
  so what 's the issue ? 
  i think the issue with schengen is the relative lack of border control quality in your country . 
  * i assume * . 
  because of freedom of movement in eu , border control is only as strong as its weakest link . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i mean . 
  thanks for the information !, 
  i use firefox , but only because chrome is unstable occasionally . 
  i feel ff is just more reliable . 
  only thing chrome does better is the private browsing mode . 
  but i have chrome installed on my computer so i use chrome for . . private browsing sessions . 
  if legislators are so worried about monopoly positions , i wonder when they are going to take on `` app stores '' . 
  especially in closed ecosystems like apple ( iphone ) , android , consoles etc , where only way to sell something is through approval process of a single company . 
  business taxes rates are least of greeces worries : http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/23/greece-tax-idusl5e8gnbjg20120523  `` right now , there is widespread tax evasion due to the fact that there is no government in place to enforce tax collection as foreseen in the bailout plan , '' panidis , the accountant 's union chief said . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8509244.stm there are plenty of examples . 
  at least keep the taxes on * same level * !,
