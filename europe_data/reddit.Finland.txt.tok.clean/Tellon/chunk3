  do n't go reducing them in a time like this . 
  also , profits are there : http://www.consensuseconomics.com/forecast_surveys/corporate_profit_forecasts.htm, 
  the current trend i am seeing in my country , in the last few years : * increase taxes on individuals , either via vat or other means * freeze wages * cut social spending * increase eu-related spending * now government has a lot of pressure to cut business-related taxes these are the so-called `` austerity measures '' we have in place . 
  one of the economic ideas is that economy is driven by consumers and the demand that they create . 
  now answer this : how can demand rise if people have nothing to spend ? 
  the problem i 'm seeing is that the so-called `` austerity measures '' only affect individuals . 
  * government corruption & inefficiency are never addressed * business-related revenue streams never go up , because businesses will find always find optimal ways to avoid paying anything . 
  i ca n't blame them . 
  i 'm just saying , this is a money-sink if government caves in and reduces taxes etc. 
  especially in the case of multi-national corporations , the taxes you reduce might not stay in the country . 
  * inefficient banks are not punished : they are bailed out . 
  banks who do unprofitable business are not weeded out . 
  thus bad practices are rewarded and continue to be a drain on the system . 
  my point here is , the so-called austerity measures would work * if they targeted these 3 points i listed above * . 
  instead of trying to fix the inefficient system , the system tries to kill its main driving factor : consumers . 
  it all confuses me . 
  there should n't be a ban on symbols , words or concepts . 
  there should be ban on extremist groups like nazis . 
  for example , swastika pre-ww2 had * nothing * to do with nazis : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika, 
  unless i 'm mistaken , these values are based on stock prices . 
  the stock prices are based on * perceived * payback or profit that the stockholders will get . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  it 's all about perception . 
  post-ww2 mental issues that have taken form of things like domestic - or alcohol abuse . 
  like father , like son etc. 
   but you do n't actually take care of yourselve if state gives you 750 euros a month . 
  it 's not that strict in scandinavia as a whole . 
  i 'm already in post-school work-life , but my little brother is still studying and he gets aid from our parents . 
  having to take aid from others is n't looked down upon . 
  your house means your rules , so living with parents can be infuriating with them watching over your shoulders every minute of the day . 
  i love my parents , but they care a bit too much . 
  if i still lived with them they 'd try to schedule my day for me etc. 
  we do n't particularly care about concepts as `` virtuous '' . 
  they are unpractical and useless . 
  i 'm surprised how little southern europe uses the internet . 
  i 'm not surprised about our own numbers . 
  best : i can go on with my day without having to worry about such things as crime or all other things the system takes care of . 
  yesterday i forgot to lock my bike when arriving to work . 
  the bike was still there when i got back . 
  also , snow makes everything pretty right now . 
  worst : i find it slightly annoying when temperature goes below -30 c. 
  i have to put on a scarf to cover my face . 
   it now looks extremely unlikely that there will be any sort of satisfactory movement on the issue before the 2014 elections to the european parliament . 
  err , i do n't see how eu parliament is sidelined . 
  only thing i see is that commission has stalled all decisions on the subject for now ? 
  i think that is a good thing . 
   the 5 % go to the eu ( or ez government ) , so they will spend that money and the national government does n't have to . 
  and why would there be a need for this ? 
  my government is doing a good job . 
  well , decent , but it 's a better job than i think someone else would . 
  biggest problem with selling energy drinks to minors is that they are not in full control of their body yet . 
  excessive caffeine can absolutely wreck your sleeping schedule . 
  if i drink caffeine after 18 ( 6pm ) or so , i ca n't sleep until well after midnight . 
  then there are side-effects , like withdrawal after heavy use that will cause issues because they do n't understand their body yet . 
  i 'd ban selling energy drinks to under 15 year olds , because they are in a critical age in their development and they need that good nights sleep . 
  but ban up to 18 years would be excessive . 
  in a political union where eu has budgetary powers over member states , eu could put those `` leeches '' in line . 
  so , i 'm not talking about monetary aid necessarily . 
  what i mean is , countries need to feel that eu is something more than big countries tool to ensure their own national interests . 
   net contributors complain that they 'll finance the inabilities of others and lose sovereignty . 
  net receivers complain that they 'll lose sovereignty and will be ruled by technocrats who do n't understand the `` the hardship of the life in $ country '' . 
  i think it 's up to big players to show to small countries that they can put european interests before their national interests . 
  if this ca n't happen , then why on earth would small countries give up their sovereignty just to get trampled by big countries in the european parliament or whatever the new deciding entity will be ? 
  big countries need to prove that small countries wo n't be trampled , discarded and forgotten in the new union . 
  i agree . 
  but in my opinion the point of no return was already 5 + years ago . 
  the milk was already spilled when greece tried to have an unsustainable mountain of debt . 
  the economic reforms that are made now should have been made 20 years ago . 
   what you really need to do is restructure and make the payments affordable , so that the country can start investing in their economy again . 
  as long as this does n't mean forgiving debt , i 'm on board . 
  even if it means delaying payments by 30 to 50 years . 
  greece ** has to ** change in order for their economy to become viable . 
  but i 'm afraid that if we simply forgive the debt , there is no need to change . 
  the irresponsible behaviour would be rewarded . 
  the unsustainable debt-driven economy would remain and greece would again be at the verge of default in 10 to 15 years . 
  i stand by my words , in finland we take debt very seriously . 
  except in finland you ca n't get rid of ( personal ) debt by declaring bankruptcy . 
  we create a payment plan for the person in question , but often things go to foreclosure . 
  hey !, 
  we object to ** donating ** money to greece . 
  because that is what these loans to greece are starting to feel like , donations . 
  we know very well greece ca n't realistically pay back the debt . 
  which is why we `` act like we do '' . 
  personally i 'd be ok with `` pay back 30 years later '' option . 
  at least then we 'd get the money back eventually . 
  probably . 
  i hope . 
  i think as a country we 'd prefer paying back later over just forgiving the debt . 
  outright forgiving of debt would be out of the question imo , because if greece gets its debt forgiven , why ca n't we too get a debt relief ? 
  and at the same time my bank could forgive my debt too . 
  or do i have to get myself bankrupt before they can forgive my debt ? 
  i agree with this . 
  coming sunday and the aftermath will be big news regardless of what happens . 
  i do n't think eu has handled this crisis very well . 
  but let 's not forget that milk was already spilled when greece took on so much debt that they could n't pay it . 
  nobody forced greece to take the original debt that broke the back . 
  core issue is the fundamentally broken system in greece ( or they would n't have been in danger of default in the first place ) . 
  i really hope that people of greece will be able to unite , roll up their sleeves and start the hard work that is required to fix their society . 
  eu hate and eu blame game will only serve to distract from the real issues . 
  i do agree eu has n't been constructive in this .
