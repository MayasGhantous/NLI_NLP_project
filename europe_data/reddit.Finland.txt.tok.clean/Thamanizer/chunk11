  politically , there 's absolutely no pull for getting them in right now - germany and france do n't like other big political powers in their playing field , uk and eastern europe do n't like the idea of 80 million more poor people having the freedom of mobility across europe , and southeastern countries have long-standing grudges against turkey no matter what . 
  `` never allowed to join '' means really that it 's not entirely in turkey 's hands to make it to the eu . 
  even if turkey fulfilled the economic , transparency , democratic , and human rights criteria , it would be up to european countries to 1 ) forgive the distruption to the power balance ( france , germany , even uk would be pissed if eu got another big hitter to take some of their power ) 2 ) forgive political tensions and grudges ( greece , cyprus , and many balkan countries hate turkey and would likely block their entrance even if turkey made reconciliations ) . 
  these two huge things are not up to turkey , and thus the membership is not just dependent on their progress like it was with eastern europe . 
  turkey can not make it to the eu by doing just the same things as balkan or eastern european countries have done - there 's far too much opposition that does not depend on that kind of progress . 
  no , it 's not . 
  gay parents can be just as good or better than straight parents , even if it turned out that they were n't on average ( unlikely with the current data ) , just like russians and rurals and non-academics . 
  it 's far more effective to assess each case individually , as it is done now with the exception of same-sex couples - statistics do not matter for individual cases . 
  if each case is assessed individually , the admissions will look like the good/bad parenting ratios for each demographic and this does n't require any special discrimination . 
  far more egalitarian , and more effective too for the children . 
  why do they even need to be 100 % equally well-off ? 
  there 's lots of evidence that russian parents ( in finland ) are worse parents on average , but they are still not restricted or discriminated against in the adoption process in any way . 
  same for people without academic education , and people from rural areas , and deeply religious people . 
  as long as the couple has the ability to provide good parenting , which the adoption process and the subsequent social work is tasked to ensure , why should their social/ethnic/sexual group have any special influence on it ? 
  only very recently has this been the case . 
  ever since the shah was installed by a cia-backed coup and continuing with the post-revolution regime , political killings and prison camps were commonplace in iran . 
  they are still more liberal than the saudis in the civil liberties department , of course . 
  i did n't know that it was even allowed in hungary , i 'm positively surprised about that . 
  well , it is n't allowed at all in finland ( till next year ) and in a lot of other countries , so there certainly is a lot of limiting liberties in this regard . 
  they themselves admitted that the story was fabricated yesterday . 
  slippery slope , not necessarily a straw man . 
  straw man would have been arguments like `` but why are you forcing people to be gay '' , in other words arguing against caricatures of your arguments because he could n't argue against the actual ones . 
  biologically , the norm is that a certain percentage of children are born gay . 
  it 's not a disorder because it does n't require treatment ( other than stopping people from violently venting their aggressions , suppressed homosexual thoughts , and insecurities on gays . ), 
  thank you for making that sub . 
  seriously . 
  collective survival versus individual survival . 
  if populations with a certain chance of being born gay survive better than ones that do n't , then a gene that gives you a chance of being gay will get passed on . 
  remember , homosexuality in itself is not hereditary - straight parents can have gay kids , and vice versa in the cases where either of the gay parents take part in the insemination . 
   `` homosexuality is defined as exclusively having intercourse with animals of the same sex . 
  this has never been shown in the wild . 
  the only animal where they believe it might occur in is sheep , which is a domesticated animal being raised in captivity . 
  the article needs some major work '' there was no evidence of this claim by either you or the commenter . 
  the wikipedia article was in complete disagreement as well , and unlike the comment it also cited sources for its several examples of sexual activity between animals of the same sex . 
  no , single parents are not analogous with same-sex parents .

  ] ( http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/lgb-parent-families-july-2014.pdf ) ( 6 links ) imo you need serious scientific evidence in order to * limit * people 's liberties - the null hypothesis should be that gay couples are allowed to adopt unless you can give enough evidence that they should n't be able to . 
  and these studies do not point to that direction at all . 
  then the balkan wars should n't count either , so your 26 years becomes 71 . 
  the solution to economic sanctions is diplomacy and curtailing the anger , like they just did in iran . 
  gaddafi was more willing to starve his people than to be friendly with europe . 
  it 's absurd that the best way to get in as a refugee is to fare through an incredibly dangerous journey on sea without any guarantee of getting there . 
  the eu should ditch the dublin treaty ( effectively done already ) and let the people apply for asylum in the refugee camps . 
  no forced quotas on any country , but voluntary participation in the asylum application program . 
  that way we could mostly get families in ( and not the only people who survive the journey ) and offer a safe trip in without having masses of unregistered people wandering to whichever country has ' t built a fence . 
  trudeau has a point . 
  you might have missed that usa was economically and politically integrated the whole time . 
  and canada had very closely aligned interests to america . 
  the only border that was about mad at any point was with mexico , because it would have been a slaughter to try and invade america even if the two countries started getting uneasy . 
  that 's just one of the many un branches . 
  the thing is , the completely separate un treaties ( which work just fine the vast majority of time because the member states * choose * to sign them ) are sometimes disobeyed , with the only enforced consequence being that you lose the trust of the other countries who signed the treaty with you . 
  btw , i 'm really really disappointed that so many europeans want to break the international law . 
  it 's literally only things that the countries have agreed and promised to do , for their own benefit of getting a bit of trust from other countries .

  federations and countries can have autonomous regions . 
  i 'd prefer uk to stay and contribute to the eu , but also have its way when it really needs . 
  the tampere one actually has a few cool little architectural tricks that make it a clever addition to the city . 
  too bad it 's made out of boring 80s materials . 
  we can help them for snus, 
  in which ones ? 
  do n't fucking quote the `` 58 % public sector '' numbers because that 's a misconception , based on false information about the metric . 
  those figures are always the public spending as a percent of gdp , or in other words just the amount of money that at some point circulates through a public agency . 
  the same number for the private sector is usually well over 200 % . 
  the size of the public ownership relative to gdp is a different thing . 
  i do n't think there 's any western european country where that is past 25 or 30 percent . 
  belarus could be . 
   justification has fuck all to do with it , it 's what happened , and the country grew in many ways from it , while at the same time at great costs . 
  but it still was a fucking advantage nevertheless . 
  how did the country grow or benefit from political killings and ethnic cleansing ? 
  germany was not weak either . 
  even usa could n't have lasted being invaded by all the rest of the big global powers at once . 
  from the wikipedia article :  ** controversy over finnish participation **  * almost all historians regard the siege as a german operation and do not consider that the finns effectively participated in the siege . 
  * russian historian nikolai baryshnikov argues that active finnish participation did occur , but historians have been mostly silent about it , most likely due to the friendly nature of post-war soviet -- finnish relations . 
  [ 89 ] the main issues which count in favor of the former view are : ( a ) the finns mostly stayed at the pre-winter war border at the karelian isthmus ( with small exceptions to straighten the frontline ) , despite german wishes and requests , and ( b ) they did not bombard the city from planes or with artillery and did not allow the germans to bring their own land forces to finnish lines . 
  baryshnikov explains that the finnish military in the region was strategically dependent on the germans , and lacked the required means and will to press the attack against leningrad any further . 
  [ 90 ] there 's arguments to be made for the finnish participation , but that requires debating what counts as participation . 
  finnish forces did not approach the leningrad area nor did they bomb it in any way . 
  you can argue that the finnish presence in the north disturbed the soviet supply lines decisively , but certainly not that the finnish forces did anything that would fit under any usual definitions of siege tactics within 50 km of leningrad . 
  it seems that it 's few russian historians who insist that finland laid siege like the germans did . 
  and when they did , they got axed ( the story of lalli ) . 
  i 'd say including that would also mean that they should include places with `` holy '' or `` sacr\u00e9 '' in them . 
  can you point at any particular treaty that france would violate in doing that ? 
  to my knowledge , none of the eu countries has signed the 2003 migrant treaty that deals with these things . 
  get off of your high horse . 
  the eu has cut its emissions twice as much as the richer usa and it always had a significantly lower carbon footprint both per capita and in total . 
  the eu also gives around 60 % of the world 's development aid , which is about three times as much as usa despite having a similar gdp . 
  now it 's true that usa spends a lot more on its military and europe does profit from it , but the main culprit for the need of its presence in eu is that european countries waste money on securing borders between friendly states and pursuing their own military pet projects . 
  given sufficient coordination , elevating eu 's own defense to a credible level would not be too costly to prohibit the welfare states at all . 
  maybe a bit tougher , but definitely not in a profound way . 
  besides , even if usa left europe it would still spend much more on military . 
  sweden is mediocre at pisa , largely because of failed reforms 10-ish years ago , which by and large led to a much softer approach on education . 
  they originally had a very similar system to finland , but nowadays they have effectively completely liberalized the school system . 
  the parents choose the schools freely , and the schools choose their methods and approaches freely . 
  of course , the average swedish middle class parent predominantly favours the schools with the most `` novel '' and `` alternative '' approaches to education - often meaning stuff like no homework and very little actual exercises . 
  over the course of the 10 years since the reform , sweden 's pisa scores have gradually fallen a total 20-25 % from finland 's levels to around italy 's , uk 's , russia 's , or usa 's performance . 
  even then , there is the problem that people 's intelligence develops at vastly varying paces . 
  several of my physics professors nearly failed their math classes at primary school , but nowadays they are some of the most respected scientists of the country . 
  it 's idiotic to waste money on tens of thousands of kilometers of internal eu borders , when it would be far more efficient to manage a few thousand km of external borders . 
  same with military ; with a centrally coordinated eu military , the us would n't need to nanny over 28 smaller militaries with their own goals even with the current spending . 
  it 's wasteful , inefficient , counterproductive , and a part of the reason why europe ca n't stand up politically as tall as usa despite having a similarly sized economy and larger population .
