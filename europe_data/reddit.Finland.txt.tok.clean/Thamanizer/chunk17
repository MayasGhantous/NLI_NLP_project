   ( ... )  the best prekindergarten programs for lower ses children have a substantial effect on iq , but this typically fades by late elementary school , perhaps because the environments of the children do not remain enriched . 
  there are two exceptions to the rule that prekindergarten programs have little effect on later iq . 
  both are characterized by having placed children in average or above-average elementary schools following the prekindergarten interventions . 
  children in the milwaukee project ( garber , 1988 ) program had an average iq 10 points higher than those of controls when they were adolescents . 
  children in the intensive abecedarian prekindergarten program had iqs 4.5 points higher than those of controls when they were 21 years old ( campbell , ramey , pungello , sparling , & millerjohnson , 2002 ) .3  ( ... )  if sweden represents the asymptote that we are likely to see for modern nations ' gains , the iq gap between developing and developed nations could close by the end of the 21st century and falsify the hypothesis that some nations lack the intelligence to fully industrialize . 
  in 1917 , americans matched the lowest iqs found in the developing world today . 
  it seems plausible that the first step toward modernity raises iq a bit , which paves the way for the next step , which raises iq a bit more , and so forth  ( ... )  about the black -- white difference in iq , which at the time was about 15 points , the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) article stated , `` there is not much direct evidence on this point , but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis . '' that conclusion stands today : there has been no new direct evidence on the question . 
  ( ... ) one of the most telling of the studies was available at the time of the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) report but was apparently not known to them . 
  this is an adoption study by moore ( 1986 ) . 
  she examined the iqs of black and mixedrace children averaging 81\u20442 years of age who were adopted by middle-class families who were either black or white . 
  the children who were of half-european origin had virtually the same average iq as the children who were of exclusively black origin . 
  hence european genes were of no advantage to this group of `` blacks . '' children ( both black and mixed-race ) adopted by white families had iqs 13 points higher on average than those adopted by black families , indicating that there were marked differences in the environments of black and white families relevant to socialization for iq ; indeed , the differences were large enough to account for virtually the entire black -- white gap in iq at the time of the study . 
   ( ... )  dickens and flynn ( 2006 ) analyzed data from nine standardization samples for four major tests of cognitive ability . 
  they found that blacks gained 5.5 iq points on whites between 1972 and 2002 . 
  the gap between blacks and whites on a measure of g had narrowed almost to the same degree , that is , by 5.13 points . 
  requiring scientific standards is not grasping at straws , it is essential if we actually want to know something . 
   we can be confident that the environmental differences that are associated with social class have a large effect on iq . 
  we know this because adopted children typically score 12 points or more higher than comparison children ( e.g. , siblings left with birth parents or children adopted by lower ses parents ) , and adoption typically moves children from lower to higher ses homes . 
  a meta-analysis available at the time of the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) article found an effect of adoption of lower ses children by upper-middle-class parents of 12 points ( locurto , 1990 ) . 
  a subsequent adoption study by duyme , dumaret , and tomkiewicz ( 1999 ) found that the iq difference between children adopted by upper-middle-class parents and those adopted by lower ses parents was about 12 points . 
  a recent meta-analysis by van ijzendoorn , juffer , and klein poelhuis ( 2005 ) found an average effect of adoption of 18 points . 
  utterly discounted ? 
  there is plenty of discussion on the field , for example this one with flynn himself as an author : https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-67-2-130.pdf it seems that people on internet just feel good thinking that the scientists have come up with more controversial results than what they really did , and that the results are somehow being covered up . 
  ehh . 
  the consensus is that there are inherited parts , but nowhere near as much as the genetic determinist movement made it out to be ( and what the 4chan edgelord types keep on repeating ) . 
  why do people seem so obsessed with putting words in scientists ' mouths when they could just read the damn papers themselves . 
  depends on how you see ` race . ', 
  certainly , if you view race as the whole package consisting of culture , social structures , wealth , genetics , and all that , you can not deny that there are differences - however , there is not enough evidence to quantify the effect of interracial genetic differences alone , since various geographical , cultural , economical , developmental , academical , even medical reasons make the raw data incomparable . 
  for example there is a good amount of evidence that temperature , childhood diseases , and the types of problems you have encountered in life affect the scores drastically . 
  if say children from shanghai are taught problems similar to the ones encountered in iq tests , it will be directly visible in their scores ( repeating an iq test tends to raise the score by 6-7 points ) . 
  if you grow up in a neighbourhood where the water comes from lead pipes , that will affect the scores . 
  if your mother drank while pregnant , that affects your scores . 
  if you suffered from malnutrition or serious disease in some point in your childhood , that affects your scores . 
  if you take the test in 30 \u00b0 celsius versus 20 \u00b0 celsius , it will also affect the scores . 
  tl ; dr : too many variables to make a meaningful comparison . 
  according to the wikipedia article , subjects who repeat an iq test tend to gain 6-7 points . 
  that is also why most statistical figures only include tests performed to subjects unfamiliar with the particular test , but this is problematic in developed countries where even young subjects might have encountered similar problems at school . 
  maybe it will pose a limit at some point . 
  in any case , it seems clear that there is no reason to propose a * genetic * cause - i was debating against racial , not geographical determinism . 
  [ the gap is indeed diminishing , although more modestly than the european growth of the last century due to slower rise in standards of living . 
  ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222684285_raven%27s_test_performance_of_sub-saharan_africans_average_performance_psychometric_properties_and_the_flynn_effect_learning_and_individual_differences_20_135-151 )  the steepness of the regression lines suggests the presence of a considerable flynn effect in african adults ( -- ) on average , these regression lines suggest an average iq increase of 7 points per decade , which is comparable to that reported of adult males in the netherlands between 1952-1982 ( flynn 1987 ) . 
  that 's a circular argument with no evidence . 
  `` groups are different because of iq differences -  iq differences between groups are valid at their face value -  groups are different because of iq differences . '', 
  in usa , races are clearly segregated from each other and definitely not for genetic reasons . 
  look at brazil , for example , where the groups blended freely with little to no segregation despite similarly different genetic makeups . 
  also , the flynn effect ( increase in average iq by around 20 points in europe between 1930 and 1985 ) shows clearly how the degree of development affects iq independent of genes , so disregarding developmental factors is intellectually dishonest . 
  if half of african americans in the last century grew up with aggravated amounts of childhood disease , in segregated and underfunded schools , drinking water from lead pipes , it should not come as a surprise that their average iq would be lower . 
  there are a lot of variables that i suppose all are related to the numbers . 
  on the physical side , malnutrition and diseases can damage the brain every bit as much as genetic factors - since genes did not change significantly during the time the flynn effect was active in developed countries , we can at least say that both may have had effect . 
  things like higher rates of lead poisoning in american minority neighbourhoods have likely had their effects too . 
  on the social side , the level of education has improved , making people start abstract thinking and problem solving earlier in life . 
  similarly , people might have started facing more problem solving in their lives . 
  the difficult part is figuring out the extent of each factor . 
  it 's usually agreed that iq is influenced by education , nutrition , diseases , and birth defects . 
  alcohol can have adverse effects in all of these . 
  the field is full of methodological errors though . 
  the nearly universally cited lynn-vanhanen study , for example , [ included samples of retarded children in the sub-saharan numbers as representative of whole countries , and some of the surveys they used excluded `` unexpectedly high '' scores from their samples ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222684285_raven%27s_test_performance_of_sub-saharan_africans_average_performance_psychometric_properties_and_the_flynn_effect_learning_and_individual_differences_20_135-151 ) . 
  in usa , races are not only different in terms of genetics . 
  they are clearly separate socio-economic and cultural groups , and failing to account for those differences ( which is nigh impossible ) does not provide useful data . 
  couple that with tons of methodological errors in iq testing - [ even the most cited studies in the field are rampant with them ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222684285_raven%27s_test_performance_of_sub-saharan_africans_average_performance_psychometric_properties_and_the_flynn_effect_learning_and_individual_differences_20_135-151 ) - and you can see why these simple data sets are not sufficient . 
  but that 's besides the point . 
  there is no reason to assume that africans ' average iq would be genetically capped at 80 , since there are a ton of variables like malnutrition , lack of education , and diseases currently limiting it . 
  and even then , it seems to be the case that the data we have about it is lacking and often poorly analyzed : [ one of the most commonly cited figures about sub-saharan africa quite literally included samples only consisting of mentally handicapped children as if they were representative of the rest of the population . 
  ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222684285_raven%27s_test_performance_of_sub-saharan_africans_average_performance_psychometric_properties_and_the_flynn_effect_learning_and_individual_differences_20_135-151 ), 
   most of it is genetic , meaning you inherit it . 
  evidence ? 
  from what i 've seen , the flynn effect seems to have the most influence of any observed variables - the european average iq rose about 15-20 points during the 20th century , which is around similar to how much lower the average iq is in sub-saharan africa at the moment . 
  given that there were little genetic changes during that time , it 's not hard to see how it is more of a function of non-genetic variables . 
  besides education , there are many other environmental things that can affect an individual 's iq . 
  malnutrition , diseases , and the general stimulativeness of the environment all have documented effects . 
  hitler did not invade sweden and sweden did not give him the refugees . 
  it 's a whole lot better than the alternative of sweden declaring war , hitler easily taking sweden , and putting tens of thousands of additional jews , homosexuals , and communists to the death camps . 
  you seem to be assuming that iq would only be a function of genetics , which it clearly is not . 
  are you familiar with the flynn effect ? 
  the average iq in europe rose from levels common in africa today by a total of 15-20 points during the 20th century , after which it seems to have stopped growing . 
  what do you think happened during the century ? 
  it tends to correlate with nutrition , schooling levels , lack of diseases , and test familiarity ( both of which are extremely high in western europe , and high but not as high in eastern europe ) rather than just time . 
  this is also directly visible in average iq scores , with the lowest av . 
  iq in yugoslavian countries and the highest in scandinavia and western europe . 
  some consider the flynn effect to be topped off in developed countries , with poland and baltic countries now reaching nearly similar scores as western european countries . 
  it 's obvious that they will have a lower average iq than native germans . 
  the flynn effect ( increase of average iq over time as development increases ) is in full strength in western europe . 
  [ this is a long paper with many points , but an interesting one is that the average iq of uk in 1948 , standardizing uk 's 1994 performance as 100 , was almost as low as it is sub-saharan africa today ( 81 vs. 
  ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222684285_raven%27s_test_performance_of_sub-saharan_africans_average_performance_psychometric_properties_and_the_flynn_effect_learning_and_individual_differences_20_135-151 ) the article also handily debunks a fair bit of popular figures for average iq in africa - for example , many of the studies used small sample sizes , non-standard test procedures , and one study that the vanhanen figure used for an entire country solely concerned mentally retarded children . 
  how would a military swedish opposition have benefitted anybody ? 
  if anything , their neutrality saved tons of lives because germany did n't invade and take thousands of danish/german/polish jews ( that sweden took in as refugees ) to death camps . 
  supercell is a fairly large company and also unique in that it prides itself in not dodging taxes ( rovio does the same btw ) . 
  their share would be far lower if kone , microsoft 's finnish division , nokia , etc. 
  did n't artificially drop their profits by paying `` licencing fees '' for dutch shell companies . 
  the only thing that visa-free travel removes from the equation is one form that you have to fill before doing that plus a week or two of wait time . 
  they are n't granting everybody an automatic eu residency or work permit or citizenship you know . 
  but visa-free travel does n't make migration easier at all , besides the trivial travelling part . 
  you still have to apply for residency , work visa , and citizenship all the same . 
  if a person is determined to get to europe , having to fill a simple form for a travelling visum is peanuts . 
  visa-free travel has literally nothing to do with migration or working rights or residency rights or voting rights . 
  20-30 years is actually a normal time for the mortgage to be paid in finland . 
  in sweden , they do n't even expect the mortgages to be fully paid off anymore thanks to their insane housing bubble .
