  tons = billions . 
  so a romanian weighs about a milligram or less ? 
  then there 's teams like finland that just own in every possible way . 
  and the bulgarians just sort of slipped in , without making any noise or unwanted stereotypes . 
  so that 's where the 5 % comes from ... jk , but the figure that actually matters is the employment rate . 
  not really their concern anymore . 
  illegal immigrants are there just trespassing anyways ( save for the possible future ukrainian refugees , but i think the eu would launch a collective project if that happened ) . 
  the eu + nato combination should be enough to guarantee external security for a nation of 40 million , even without increasing defense spending . 
  what is happening right now ( or my interpretation of it ) is a response to the russian expansion , rather in form of of a statement than a pragmatic course of actions , and a way to make the population feel safer living next to a crumbling state . 
  is only polan now . 
  will get the d when actually stronk , and into homosex . 
  thank you !, 
  good to see somebody have a positive outlook on the matter , for once !, 
  yo mamma ... let 's not do it . 
  please . 
  which is why the horned helmets were worn seremonically . 
  but then france would top the charts . 
  you do n't want that , do you ? 
  it was cold yesterday . 
  checkmate , science !, 
  it 's putin , as you blatantly stated in the title . 
  like the stupid people living far away from cities in dirt cheap , poorly built giant mansions ? 
  not so fast , finland can int\u00f6 defendings our hockey friend !, 
  yeah , and besides , i ca n't blame you for not wearing a kurdish flair ...  ( i really , really feel guilty for that emoticon ), 
  finland , finland . 
  technically eastern europe ( more eastern than poland or slovakia , bitches !, 
  ) , culturally somewhat eastern europe , yet always dismissed as a bunch of drunken `` scandinavians '' . 
  nuclear plants are thermal plants . 
  but that 's just semantics . 
  some are , some are n't . 
  now off with the blanket statements !, 
  naturally , every poster here represents their respective country 's government and is ideologically supportive of every choice the government has made . 
  oh my god , how i love how the finnish police was granted rights to wiretap anyone charged for a crime !, 
  marriage equality should n't have happened anyway , and immigrants may go to hell ( read : sweden ) . 
  greece , your part is to starve for your irresponsible spending !, 
  except for the bankers , who will get more monies thanks to the rightful spending cuts by the government . 
  instead of easening up the tax burden for the average finnish consumer , let 's slash corporate profit tax so that the oligopolies are further encouraged to screw over their employees and customers . 
  what 's that little hospital doing over there in the tiny municipality ? 
  for the sake of efficiency , let 's move it 200 kilometers to the city . 
  it 's their own fault to live far away from civilization anyway , cheating retired farmer hillbillies . 
  russia , get you human rights ... oh wait economic partnership !, 
  gas !, 
  oligarchs buying overpriced finnish souvenirs !, 
  we love you !, 
  umm , i do n't know how the supermarkets are where you live , but even in finland , home to europe 's [ worst grocery oligopoly ] ( http://www.kauppa.fi/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/nielsen/575390-1-fin-fi/nielsen_imagelarge.jpg ) , we have a good selection of agricultural products by small companies from the mediterranean . 
  think about the better olive oil bottles , feta , hamon , anchovy ... yes , there is southern european export food . 
  lots of it . 
  and often it 's better than the northern alternatives . 
  on the other hand , south has a lot of slightly less domestic food production , which i think is what you were looking for . 
  most european unbranded vegetables , especially on winter , are cultivated by spanish corporations in [ giant greenhouses ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/04/article-2303943-19149ae7000005dc-372_964x563.jpg ) ( do n't ever buy them if you can afford not to , they scam paperless immigrants into working there for less than minimum wage ) edit : in the finnish grocery table , the market share is on the left and the change from last year is on the right . 
  3 of the largest companies , plus `` other private manufacturers '' , are presented . 
  literally all there is to european economics . 
  it 's actually montenegro . 
  google censors all the results because the name of the country contains a bad word . 
  i was rather trying to prove that you do n't need to ask why people think that way . 
  either way , thanks for some of the information . 
  i did n't know half of that before , which sort of adds to the point . 
  i would consider awarding you a delta if this was / r/changemyview . 
  pledge of allegiance ? 
  now what is that about , if not patriotism ? 
  yeah , we should totally make this into a hostage situation . 
  `` you may have a bigger phallic object that is capable of mass destruction , but we 've got your daughter ! '', 
   literally the most self-deprecating nation on the planet i 'd like to see a nation that does n't think this way of itself . 
  i won , right ? 
  for more colloquial use , there 's also `` perstuntuma '' ( pers = arse , abbreviated for use in compound words ), 
  it 's amazing how you just get used to denaturated alcohol after months of spontaneous vomiting !, 
  how 's your process with methanol ? 
  that 's impressive . 
  as the regional hegemon , russia is rather difficult to avoid . 
  wait , where did russia go ? 
  for finland at least , they 're among the top three trading partners however you look at it . 
  is the soviet trauma really that strong or did the estonians learn to shit gas and oil ? 
  a common military exists for all intensive purposes , and it is called nato . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm all but a nato fan ( finland is not there ) , but since every key member and their dog here is a part of it , there 's little need for another military union . 
  i doubt france or the uk , let alone spain or poland , would want to contribute to two different organizations , and from their perspective , nato is an integral part of the european co-operation . 
  the difference in the growth rates is n't actually that great , and will most probably diminish to a marginal level in a year or two . 
  what we should be more worried about is the distribution of the new jobs and wealth on national levels . 
  well this is interesting . 
  the original wording was `` perceived decline '' , yet you are now arguing for absolute , objective decline of the welfare state . 
  how on earth did this debate polarize so fast ? 
  someone seems a little more extremist than he actually is , and all goes boom . 
  there is a curious connection between pride and shyness . 
  which in part explains a lot about finland and swedish . 
  euroshopper energy drink is a weird thing . 
  [ it has its own cult in finland . 
  ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=euroshopper+energy+drink&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=hhfpuvu_i8im4aspxih4da&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;dpr=1#q=es%20jonne&amp;revid=872053034&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_ ), 
  wait , you use a capital l for liters in america ? 
   if it does n't bleed , it does n't hurt . 
  yeah , because you 'd fill the continent with your famously explosive procreation ... wait a second . 
  r/europe surprises me positively , once again . 
  op delivers even when op is a troll . 
  yes . 
  no commie 5 year plans anymore !, 
  seriously : kinda , but this should be researched . 
  the local turkish hairy-hands pizza places . 
  examples include ( in helsinki ) hauler pizzeria ( special smetana ) , eerikin pippuri ( the manliest glasses ever ) , and many others . 
  and obviously , any real restaurant . 
  or then you can do as we 're planning to do and let them annex you . 
  say that again and you wo n't get any pudding !, 
  the voting discipline here is questionable , as the rates have sometimes dipped below 60 % and keep on falling .
