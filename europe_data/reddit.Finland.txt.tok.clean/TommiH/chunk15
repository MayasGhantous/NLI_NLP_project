  source is wikipedia as you can see from the url, 
  it 's just too easy, 
  yes.i hope we spent all our money to weapons like america does , 
  what are you talking about ? 
  even their unsubsidized prizes are many times cheaper than in america . 
  lol !, 
  i think only illegal south americans are allowed to move there these days, 
  here many rights are tied to citizenship . 
  but it 's still different . 
  guns are n't something you would talk at a work coffee table, 
  i see . 
  sounds little socialist to me , 
  i 'm . 
  it 's basically only way to justify it to police . 
  in america you simply need more money . 
  people in same profession as me really do n't have anything more there, 
  i wonder if america could afford health care by getting rid of some weapons . 
  mustang is a bad choice for this comparison as taxes are carbon based here . 
  try comparing something like new samsung phone or something, 
  like where ? 
  because people liked my first health care related post here :(, 
  it 's in many countries like that . 
  technically illegal but no one cares about it . 
  public drinking is illegal in some places in finland , 
  that has to be maybe the biggest downside of america in my eyes . 
  hmm wikipedia seems to disagree with you . 
  interesting . 
  are federal jobs the best ones ? 
  that 's what you need to do when starting the hobby . 
  to get a semi auto `` assault rifle '' is a different story :p, 
  interesting ... 
  that is really something ... 
  they canceled the bill ? 
  not in finland we are n't . 
  it 's true that we should encourage old people to drink even more , 
  he paid 6 euros . 
  that latter one would cost  $ 2500-5000 in america . 
  so it seems to me finland has very reasonable prices for drugs . 
  it 's  1.8 which is much better than in most rich countries . 
  this added to our very moderate immigration , finnish population is steadily increasing , 
  hmm should i choose a long and healthy life or to live in a country that has many ships ... 
  this is a tough one :d, 
  that `` sanction '' has nothing to do with health care . 
  also you can always turn to social security office . 
  are you lestadiolainen ? 
  well i think people should pay for their own expenses mostly , but supporting of making new taxpayers is n't the worst investment . 
  no wonder they are too scared to take vacations :d, 
  you need to join reservil\u00e4isliitto to be able to by an ar-15 . 
  active reservist may be the correct term . 
  i have no idea why a non citizen would think he 's obliged to tax payer money though . 
  in finland we have this problem too . 
  even though we have like 20 % less debt than germany :d i would say anywhere in europe is good . 
  and maybe in canada . 
  it 's hard to explain but you can enroll to these voluntary courses to deepen your knoweledge and skills . 
  what . 
  the . 
  actual . 
  i always thought that finland was only country communist enough to have such high taxes . 
  must suck big time to take home less than half of your own money then end up needing a separate insurance ... 
  aa okay that 's not too bad . 
  but what 's strange is that germans pay huge taxes and yet they need to buy insurances ... sensible law  i 'm sure it 's better than in 99 % of countries !, 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  every single finnish citizen residing in finland is `` insured '' . 
  you article says that 679 $ is the absolute maximum a one person could have to pay in a year !, 
  i see  if you were from these parts of the world you may have had a change : http://www.helsinki.fi/~sugl_smi/kuvat/kartat/kielet/fenno-ugrian_languages.jpg, 
  so if you pay you get to cut the line at public hospitals ? 
  well it seems kinda unsafe to me . . you have to be a citizen here . 
  we can still buy them but they are not for self protection or anything like that and getting a license is not easy . 
  haha reddit teaches us stuff, 
  here you go http://www-tc.pbs.org/prod-media/newshour/photos/2012/10/02/us_spends_much_more_on_health_than_what_might_be_expected_1_slideshow.jpg, 
  i 'm sorry but that sounds really terrible taken that you pay taxes just like we do . 
  do you mean +50 % ? 
  that is just something ... 
  it 's hard to comprehend . 
  like that 's the absolute opposite of what would ever happen here . 
  i 'm not a commie so no need to lesson me about the magical wall  health care spending is like 1/5 of our budget . 
  there 's absolutely no scenario where we could n't afford that . 
  oh i did n't know netherlands had a system like that ... what do you mean by better treatment ? 
  are poorer people unable to get the best treatment ? 
  yes thanks for your input . 
  where are you from ? 
  well it 's not my baby but everyone gets one . 
  http://kolmistaan.bellablogit.fi/files/2015/02/aitiuspakkaus2.jpg but my question is , how come so many foreigners know about this box ? 
  actually only people making like over 30k-35k $ / year pay more than get . 
  dude ... 
  i thought finland was the number even in something :( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp, 
  and get thrown to jail i assume ? 
  yes you can choose that or some sum of money . 
  also the box is designed to work as a crib . 
  for some reason they do n't want more tax payers and included condoms . 
  you must be from / r/murica right ? 
  of course not . 
  this woman was upper or middle class . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  our budget is fairly balanced and health care is only 20 % of it . 
  did donald trump tell you that no one can afford welfare state ? 
  one could think that there must be a lot of people who just do n't go to doctor if they have problems ... 
  that 's hard to believe . 
  $ 3k is in no way a fair compensation for that . 
  are they just overcharging your insurence company ?
