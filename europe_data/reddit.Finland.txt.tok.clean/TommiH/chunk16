  is your insurence a good one ? 
  execute as in doing something or in killing someone ? 
  :d hukka means literally `` loss '' in finnish . 
  `` hukka perii '' would be directly `` loss collects ( you ) '' meaning you are in trouble . 
  actually it means that even today . 
  why are you so angry , is your local mosque too loud or something ? 
  i wonder if they teach avionics in sharia school ? 
  `` at the end of 2013 , brazil unexpectedly picked the swedish offer , thanks to its offsets , price , and lack of diplomatic baggage . '', 
  keep telling yourself some countries buy them because they are best , 
  i 'm actually suprised that croatians are fatter than we are !, 
  i always thought all the slavic countries are thin ... people talk like we are the fattest and laziest in the world . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  :d so if i moved there as an expat or something i could buy all the guns i wanted ? 
  could a resident alien buy a gun in virginia ? 
  umm what 's wrong with cruising around in a 1970 pickup blastin lynyrd skynyrd ? 
  sounds fun to me, 
  i wish it was this easy in my country too :( one needs to join army reservists to be able to buy an ar :( otherwise we are pretty much stuck with hunting rifles and shotguns . 
  handguns for sporting only . 
  that 's a lot if you do n't make much money . 
  in finland you have to earn over 35k $ / year to became `` a payer '' . 
  meaning that everyone making less than that actually get more stuff than they pay for . 
  so you are a real retarded person ? 
  i 'm sure finnish health care system has some program suitable for you , 
  in regards of public sector i meant . 
  by oecd by eu by un take your pick ... 
  regarding health care spending : http://www-tc.pbs.org/prod-media/newshour/photos/2012/10/02/us_spends_much_more_on_health_than_what_might_be_expected_1_slideshow.jpg, 
  http://www-tc.pbs.org/prod-media/newshour/photos/2012/10/02/us_spends_much_more_on_health_than_what_might_be_expected_1_slideshow.jpg finland is actually very efficient . 
  roflmao finland is easily one of the unhealthiest countries in europe . 
  we even have this saying `` one should n't walk further than a lenght of his car '' . 
  but honestly i do n't think it 's great to brag about how less you spend if you do n't live longer than the other guy, 
  i see !, 
  our fairytale name for wolf is hukka, 
  what if you quit working ? 
  i do n't think your insurences cover unemployed people, 
  and i 'm actually happy that you have to pay even for something ... 
  so there you go , a hugely different system . 
  in finland everyone is `` insured '' by the state in any case . 
  umm you would live much longer in finland ? 
  god damn german cars suffogating people to death, 
  who are they ? 
  actually our system is ranked most efficient in europe . 
  are you joking ? 
  i meant that it 's reasonable that there 's some costs to be paid, 
  it 's mostly for people with small children . 
  also people who work get kind of an insurance from their employers . 
  but i do n't think there 's any point to compare such different systems, 
  interesting ... 
  swedish of course, 
  and of course finland is the only retard once again : facepalm :, 
  sure you can use private services too . 
  you get a subsidy but still you are using your own money a lot more . 
  in this case above if the mother is poor she does n't have to pay that bill, 
  no problem then . 
  if you are a jew !, 
  oookay :p, 
  umm what ? 
  is n't it mandatory to buy a private insurence in some cases in germany ? 
  then you will have to emigrate, 
  but you can expect the same service when you get old  in finland health care is only 20 % of budget, 
  `` u.s. total aircraft : 13,892 '' i think your combined air forces have enough planes :d, 
   2nd world `` the second world refers to the former socialist industrial states ( formally the eastern bloc ) , mostly the territory and area under the influence of the soviet union . '', 
  problem ? 
  i just do n't appreciate nationalistic views on such an objective matter . 
  only one plane can be the best and if you have money it 's not this current grippen . 
  that next gen model may have a shot but finland is going to order these in few years . 
   the hospital has that bill . 
  because that 's how they charge the insurance . 
  even if both are public . 
  no they charge the governement . 
  you only get insurence if you want some extra private services  the hospitals ca n't just grab whatever money they need from the insurance fund . 
  hospital budgeting is a separate issue . 
  government gives them the money they need  if you request it you will probably get that bill . 
  no , i think we have different kind of systems . 
  drug stores are private so we get `` that bill '' from them : http://i.imgur.com/hubcvvl.jpg, 
  everything in moderation, 
  the best kind of insurence !, 
  good for you but i would n't want to pay any more taxes, 
  that 's just terrifying, 
  bill for some cancer medicine : http://i.imgur.com/hubcvvl.jpg, 
  omg you got all those poor 2nd/3rd world countries to buy your shitty budget plane !, 
  and some of them ca n't even afford to buy it :d i 'm going to report this instantly to our government and ask them to drop the order for f-35 . 
  surely all the major powers will want this dated budget plane that ca n't even carry weapons after these news :d stop you are killing me :d, 
  si system ruuuules the world  my family is so poor that we do n't even have a butler at our summer house :(, 
  ah now i understand . 
  i think it would have been close to 0 $ if her husband did n't want to stay with her . 
  hmm ? 
  haha it 's not my bill . 
  i thought quotation marks made that clear , 
  basically all the hospitals are public so that would be meaningless and no one has that kind of private insurences . 
  i get a bill like that from my private dentist though . 
  well ww2 aircrafts are infinite times more than zero :d are you just angry because no one is buying your crappy plane ? 
  next time try building a plane that can actually carry some serious weapons , 
  yea only if war was that easy . 
  btw when did swedish pilots see proper combat last time ? 
  without usa you could n't , 
  are you saying that russians are stupid enough to turn their 2nd biggest to a nuclear fallout wasteland ? 
  they had a defence pact with usa, 
  gripen would be dead before it even saw the first f-35, 
  biggest issue is that it 's not a real upgrade . 
  also this sort of a deal has a huge political prize and sweden is politically not important to finland .
