  that 's why london lost . 
  real estate ( we do n't rent ) there is so crazy compared to helsinki . 
  that was the biggest problem, 
  well i do n't know . 
  friend of mine just turned down and offer from london . 
  his overall compensation would have been lower than in finland, 
  how does finland get that money back then ? 
  money goes out but how does it come back ? 
  whatever you say mr anonymous internet hero, 
  at least finnish numbers show that per capita we pay some hundreds of euros . 
  i really do n't have a reason to believe this map is n't accurate, 
   owning large chunks of economy in the poorer states i do n't think that 's how the market works, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  finland at least has used billions to this eu project . 
  also this shows how half of the countries are subsidizing the other half . 
  all the contributions are based on your gdp and population , so feel free to calculate the percentages if you like those more . 
  our government taxes us and then wire transfers the money to eu who funds stuff like roads in these shitty countries . 
   what does this show , though ? 
  direct benefits ? 
  umm we send plain cash to those countries . 
  sorry about that topic btw, 
   fashion models around $ 100-200 per hour nice !, 
  is this legal in romania btw ? 
  here in finland it is ( no brothels though ), 
  how much is a whore in poland ? 
  in finland about 150-200 $ / hour, 
  true that . 
  but `` dirtwater '' would n't be bad either, 
  ... are you serious ? 
  fuck i hope we get our fixit :d, 
  two reasons : 1 . 
  they do n't pay for it 2 . 
  they changed the law so that the child has a right to know who his biological father is, 
  umm no `` loka '' is n't that spesific, 
  let 's hope they will build that tunnel !, 
  loka means dirt in finnish . 
  oh that 's interesting , `` better '' employees go to finland ? 
  for finnish companies it 's a win because they get cheaper labor . 
  of course this can lead some unemployment, 
  and you have no idea what you are talking about, 
  1/3 of non finnish inmates are estonian , 
  haha sorry it has been a taxing weekend :d http://www.huffingtonpost.com/blake-fleetwood/finland-2_b_4373187.html no one said you are n't doing well !, 
  i think estonia is easily the best ex soviet . 
  btw finland started in the 60s . 
  and my motorcycle :(, 
  well technically you are bordering a nordic so maybe . 
  i will bring this to our council, 
  what the hell are blabbering about ? 
  is singapore nordic just because it is independent and not poor ? 
  you should really educate yourself on this issue . 
  start by googling what `` nordic '' actually means . 
  did you count resident aliens ? 
  http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2014/09/11/virolaisia-suomessa-jo-sata-tuhatta 1/10 of estonians get their income from finland and 40000 live here . 
  no i did n't mean that !, 
  google nordic model and educate yourself, 
  actually that sounds very similar to our system  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model, 
   what the fuck is social movability ? 
  i think you missed your nordic classes  social movability means it 's easy for a poor person to become rich and your dad 's wealth does n't matter . 
  in nordic countries this is highest in the world . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/intergenerational_mobility_graph-1.jpg in most western countries pension is somewhere between 60-100 % of your long time average salary . 
  i would make about 2000 $ / month if i got unemployed now . 
  i do n't think you are supposed to rely on food banks and lose your house if unemployed ... btw progressive taxation is seen very important . 
  you have a flat rate right ? 
  more stuff that nordic countries have : - students actually earn money by studying - labor unions have a strong role in politics - world 's best worker rights i 'm in no way endorsing the nordic model but i just do n't see how estonia has one . 
   maternal/family support you do n't have paternal support ? 
  auch that 's a huge minus right there , you have to be equal to become nordic . 
  but let me think ... do you have `` free '' education ? 
  do you have high social movability ? 
  is the level of your pensions and unemployment benefits high enough to support decent life ? 
  just few things from top of my head , 
  umm you do n't have like none of the social policies in place that define `` nordic '', 
  oh right . 
  btw most of the semen used in finnish fertilization clinics is danish . 
  your master race is still spreading , 
  did n't you guys get raped by nordic people ? 
  politically you are n't nordic, 
  i 'm pretty sure they are not going to build a bridge :d, 
  do n't forget that 100 000 estonians work in finland weekly . 
  that 's like 25 % of their workforce ... 
  holy fuck where are people 's normal houses ? 
  why would anyone buy a condo from a small town ... also it looks like kim jong un was their contractor, 
  lol !, 
  russia is as european as any other country, 
  umm no . 
  there are not that many somalis . 
  well eu is coupled with shengen . 
  many countries wanted to block romania and bulgaria from shengen . 
  i mean even with an eu passport you ca n't move to finland for no reason but shengen makes being illegal very easy, 
  it was vastly different pre 2000 or so . 
  almost no foreigners, 
  yea . 
  maybe you need a wall  biggest alien groups in the prison system :  vuonna 2011 kaikista vankiloiden ulkomaalaisista 27 % oli virolaisia , 13 % romanialaisia , 10 % ven\u00e4l\u00e4isi\u00e4 ja 6 % liettualaisia . 
  no wonder some people do n't appreciate eu, 
  if you have an estonian passport you are estonian in the statistics . 
  no they are not the root of all evil . 
  we have many somalis , russians , romanians committing crimes also , 
  just watch finnish `` cops '' and you will see more . 
  and the bottom line is that statistics are statistics , sorry . 
  that many ethnic estonians end up being police 's customers, 
  they would get counted as estonians of course .
