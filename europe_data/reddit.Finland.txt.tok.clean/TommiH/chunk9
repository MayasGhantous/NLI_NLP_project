  i meant that basically only normal countries not in nato in europea are austria and finland . 
  i think baltics are doing just fine and so is poland in example . 
  but this does n't matter to finns who like being russia 's bitches . 
  estonia does n't have similar slave camps for males as finland does . 
  everyone gets drafted only on paper . 
  yes . 
   with good reasons please keep your leftist `` facts '' to yourself . 
  there 's absolutely no good reasons for finland not to join and even `` the people of finland '' know that : http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/kotimaa/nato%20galluppi%20julki%20ti-17919 also no one called it `` a plot '' . 
  it 's just an alternative for nato that anti-nato people prefer . 
  no we already have this in form of benefits . 
  studies show that moving to more simple citizen 's income model would actually save money . 
  taxes and modern economy help a lot  in example gdp per capita is much higher than in isreal . 
  their domestic policies are still heavily communist, 
  any history book . 
  how 's education in your country ? 
  at least here our pension system is very healthy . 
  no problems to be seen . 
  your lesbians can withstand storms ? 
  not here . 
  economy is going down the drain . 
  unemployment keeps rising etc, 
  but is n't it true that in america over 50 % of people do n't work for their living ? 
  but usa is one of the most unequal countries in the world . 
  those numbers are very different here . 
  average and median salaries are very close to each other . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  between 1820 and 2004 only 4,7 million irish immigrated to usa . 
  ireland has a population of 6,4 million so your `` facts '' are not correct . 
  here we basically have `` citizens income '' and it 's quite nice actually  countries like sweden , denmark , norway are similar also . 
   the state is not some magical entity that grown money on trees false . 
  just come to finland and see how money literally grows `` on trees '' , 
  you are so wrong here . 
  where did you study economy ? 
  equal welfare society has been proven to benefit everyone in numerous studies . 
  good luck selling your iphones in morocco where only the rich can afford them . 
  here in finland even the poorest can buy one . 
  also for some reason these `` rich '' do n't move to the 3rd world , it 's the opposite actually . 
  there 's a huge wave of rich chinese emigrating to the west in example . 
  where do you live ? 
  bosnia ? 
  because here in the eu we pay for `` living '', 
  yes you are right . 
  finland and denmark literally look like detroit . 
  we basically have that already, 
  are you seriously comparing canadian quality of life to russia ? 
  is canadian average salary really that low ? 
  i always thought they were richer : /, 
  canadian economy is modern unlike russia 's who gets almost half of it 's budget from oil . 
   the highest valued company in the world it 's only assumed to be valuable . 
  no one knows for sure as they are very secretive .

  this is their russian counter part : http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1921420!/img/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_635/poland30n-3-web.jpg we are so fucked :d, 
  nato has hinted that finland could join numerous times . 
  also all the baltics are in already . 
  have you ever been to finland ? 
  like 98 % of landscape is nothing but trees . 
   that 's what we have to deal with by being next to russia bullshit . 
  every other civilized country bordering russia does n't have such an inhumane system . 
  in example estonia and germany . 
   closer co-operation with sweden should not be seen as moving further away from nato , rather the other way around . 
  i do n't care how you think it should be seen as that is exactly how politicians see it . 
  they do n't want to join nato so some bullshit agreement with sweden has to do . 
  my home town saw similar criminal activity as cologne, 
  what makes you say that ? 
  is there any proof that they can actually wage war ? 
  having a plan and executing it are two different things, 
  so edgy, 
  you do ? 
  we do n't do anything on christmas . 
  in fact yesterday was also a holiday, 
  good . 
  do you feel old ? 
  reddit 's average age is like 17 , 
  do n't swear, 
  whatever, 
  well they should just kill them by themselves or hand them to justice . 
  that 's how it would work if there were terrorists in my country , no drones needed , 
  haha no they have n't :d, 
  lazy germans, 
  i like what you guys are doing more : take their passports so they ca n't ever enter europe legally again . 
  many countries are moving towards legislation that would allow cancellation of one 's citizenship . 
  that idea i like more than drones actually . 
  drones are america 's solution and europe does n't have anything to do with them . 
  not in prison but let 's say you travel to syria to join isis , 
  switzerland is n't . 
  also what does that has to do with anything ? 
  for colonials at least . 
   stripped of their citizenship . 
  this would be just impossible . 
  if they are citizens , jail is basically the only solution . 
  there 's nothing illegal in killing active terrorists . 
   we are giving the jihadists ammo . 
  and who are we ? 
  maybe you guys should start doing it old school way . 
  send ground troops to massacre isis , 
  bravo !, 
  this is how you teach those liberal cheeseaters ( u/shevagleb ), 
  no it does n't work like that , even america has strict quotas for visas , but i get what you are saying . 
  your best bet is to marry american if you want to emigrate there . 
  at least in my country most immigrants do n't have much education and can only speak broken english .
