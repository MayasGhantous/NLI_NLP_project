when i was in india last year it was hard for me to intuitively convert from rupees to euros , so i ended up converting rupees to finnish marks to euros , as rupee to marks was just divided by 10 and i still had the mark = euro conversion in my head . 
  so 600 rupees = 60 marks [ utilize intuition ] = 10 euros . 
  every time new coins and bills are introduced , or people see currency they are not used to , they have the tendency to think they look like `` toy/monopoly money '' , because it has been so important to differentiate what * real * money looks like . 
  sounds like threads or war games . 
  i would love this as a dramatic political television show , but unfortunately this is real life . 
  there 's only four parties left on the cabinet . 
  the greens and left alliance are n't in the cabinet anymore . 
  i understand and support the original intentions . 
  mandatory swedish was introduced in the 70 's , during the cold war , to integrate finland better into the nordic cooperation and affiliate finland more closely to other nordic countries and the west . 
  it was finland making ties to scandinavia to negate the pressure from the soviet union . 
  it 's like a relic for many people now , and it 's not that major political issue , so other parties just buy support from the swedish party for the cabinet by promising they wo n't change the status of swedish . 
  they are like the prostitute of the parties . 
  they have been in every cabinet since 1975 because they are willing to partner up with everyone as long as the position of the swedish language stays the same . 
  so other parties `` buy '' them to be a part of their cabinet by promising the status of swedish language will not change . 
  well , at least stubb did n't fail art school . 
  * most * impressive !, 
  i remember reading about it from the media . 
  i never said anything about that . 
  it 's a well known fact . 
  he admitted it himself and said that he changed and matured during an exchange year in the us . 
  i still love [ his reaction when he noticed the camera was on ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v6vytbw.gif ) . 
  we should do the prince thing and start using `` the persons formerly known as ` black ' '' . 
  let the kid have his candy !, 
  danish people are super cool people to drink with . 
  estonians are super hospitable and friendly and tallinn is very pretty . 
  stockholm is like helsinki on steroids , which is wonderful !, 
  norwegians speaking sounds very happy and cheers me up . 
  spain & italy : i really like the relaxed outward social culture . 
  it 's an echo chamber of very right wing redditors propagating how `` non-whites '' , `` anti-whites , `` subhumans '' etc are destroying europe with immigration . 
  riga reminds me strikingly of [ turku before it burned down ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/cathedral_of_turku_1814.jpg ) in 1827 . 
  well , ours is a bit confusing language . 
  you only have specific one number of several euros . 
  the number is in singular . 
  * one * 10 $ bill = '' * kymmenen * euroa '' , but if you have * several * numbers , like several 10 $ bills it 's '' * kymmeni\u00e4 * euroja '' , or you can collate that again to the specific amount of the 10 $ bills . 
  if there 's five of them you can say generally `` kymmeni\u00e4 euroja '' or you can say `` viisikymment\u00e4 euroa '' . 
  it 's sort of confusing but the basic concept is that `` kymmenen '' or `` kaksi '' is a singular ( even though they refer to many ) , whereas `` kymmenet '' or `` kahdet '' is plural , meaning `` many tens '' or `` many twos '' . 
  actually `` euroa '' and `` sentti\u00e4 '' are n't plurals but singular partitives . 
  plural partitives would be `` euroja '' and `` senttej\u00e4 '' and just plural would be `` eurot '' and `` sentit '' . 
  usually in finnish when speaking of a certain specific amount of money of any currency plurals are not used , but there 's a partitive suffix . 
  `` this costs 10 $ '' , is a singular in finnish , `` t\u00e4m\u00e4 maksaa kymmenen euro-a '' ( the a in the end is the partitive case ) because it 's a * single specific * amount of money . 
  but if you refer to * generally to unspecific * amount of many euros , plural ( with partitive ) is used . 
  `` this costs thousands of euros '' , `` t\u00e4m\u00e4 maksaa tuhansia euro-ja '' . 
  when referring to a some particular euros of unspecific or certain specific amounts like `` take those euros '' or `` take those two 20 $ 's '' the partitive is dropped and it 's just the plural , `` ota nuo euro-t . '' ( of course you can add tons of other suffixes in addition to the plural to get words like `` euroillanikaan '' meaning `` not even with my euros '' . ), 
   but its the first time that the commission has actual and direct democratic legitimization . 
  has n't the parliament voted the commission to power for a long time already ? 
  in my opinion turkey can very well be defined european in the future . 
  it has a very rich history with europe and as the borders of european continent are a bit arbitrary , i see no reason why those borders should be * the * factor to define `` european '' once and for all . 
  i mean [ look at the map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/europe_countries_map_en_2.png ) and see how finland is isolated from southern europe which is the cradle of western civilization . 
  turkey is right next to it . 
  1000 years ago one could have argued that finland can not be european , because finland was far too removed , being geographically distant pagan country with a language completely unrelated to most of european languages . 
  and the influence and interaction of finland and the rest of europe has been historically way smaller than turkey and the rest of europe . 
  `` that should do the trick ! '', 
  more like moose apocalypse . 
  there 's actually not much proper wild reindeer anymore in finland . 
  practically all of the reindeer are domesticated and owned by someone and they do n't wander across borders , even though they wander in the wild . 
   sweden is more distant , at least if you disregard the swedish-ethnic finns . 
  i 'm not entirely sure who are you referring to , finns and their descendants in sweden or swedish speaking finns in finland . 
  but anyway , it is a rather common view in finland , especially in bilingual , dominantly finnish speaking areas that swedish speaking finns are more ethnic finns than ethnic swedes . 
  all of the swedish speaking finns i 've known have identified themselves as ethnic finns whose mother tongue is swedish . 
  in mostly swedish speaking areas , such as ostrobothnia and \u00c5land islands it is common to hold swedish speakers as an separate ethnicity from finnish speakers . 
  it 's a complex issue , but as a rule of thumb i would say swedish speakers associate themselves more finnish than swedes of sweden . 
  two anecdotes i 've heard from northern and eastern finland : in this one small town there was this guy who never drank alcohol . 
  his buddies drank , but this guy did n't . 
  said his dad was a drinker and alcohol would be bad for him also . 
  instead he drank cow blood as he was a butcher . 
  well , one day he went wild and drank alcohol . 
  he burnt his sauna to the ground and crashed his car to the barn wall . 
  then in this another town a man was accused of attempted manslaughter as he hit his friend in the head with an axe when drunk . 
  the victim survived , and they both thought it was a funny story , but as manslaughter is a public offense , the issue was taken to court anyway . 
  the prosecutor asked them what happened , but neither of them remembered anything as they had been drinking vodka heavily . 
  the prosecutor asked where the accused got the axe , and he said he took it from his bedroom . 
  prosecutor asked why the axe was in the bedroom . 
  accused said because he usually sleeps in bed with the axe . 
  anyway , the two guys remained friends and still thought it was a nice bonding experience for their friendship , and thought the court case was just a silly interference . 
  so , a lot of finnish rednecks causing trouble . 
  at least now i have a reason to believe northern and eastern finland are popular tourist spots , if nothing else :(, 
   just ask the lobbyists . 
  jus keep in mind that `` lobbyists '' also includes organizations like amnesty international , oxfam , environmental organizations , transparency international and so on . 
  lobbyists are not just corporate interest , but also the civil society balancing the corporate interests . 
  in finland you are officially swedish speaking finn if you cross your mother tongue as swedish and you are a finn . 
  many swedish speaking finns do n't even bother to register as swedish speakers , because for them there might not be a difference on preference between swedish and finnish , as their another parent speaks primarily swedish and another parent finnish . 
  for example my friends mother is a swedish speaking finn , but my friend is n't , just because she does n't speak swedish ash her mother tongue , but finnish . 
  if they would have raised her to speak swedish and registered that officially , she would officially be swedish speaking finn . 
  i would like russian gays , lesbians and such to come to finland . 
  then when putin will be like `` i 'll protect my fellow russians from finnish oppression ! '', 
  the russian gays in finland would be like `` bitch , please '' . 
  not cool dude , not cool, 
  i 've never met a swedish speaking finn that would consider him/herself as ethnically swedish rather than finnish . 
  it 's like they are distinct subset of the finnish ethnicity , not swedish . 
  finnish speakers and swedish speakers originating from sweden have mingled for almost a thousand years , with tons finnish speakers changing their names and language to swedish during the swedish rule and under the russian rule and then independence swedish speakers changing their language and names into finnish . 
  so there 's been quite blending . 
  in addition : i think it is very good that you wonder and ask those questions , and i wish more people would do the same . 
  exposing your thoughts willingly for criticism and opposite opinions is a great way to hear differing opinions and learn . 
  and remember , people who never change their opinions learn much less in life . 
  but there * already is competition * . 
  not between nations , but between companies . 
  because of the common single market a company in germany has to compete of the customers with a danish and uk company , as there are no trade barriers and the flow of services , employees and goods is largely uninhibited . 
  but competition also generates questionable and even negative consequences as companies are looking more and more ways of making money . 
  that 's why it is handy that the common single market has a common single regulator that for example bans dangerous chemicals and demands certain safety and environmental standards from the products . 
  that 's not because the eu is a puppet .
