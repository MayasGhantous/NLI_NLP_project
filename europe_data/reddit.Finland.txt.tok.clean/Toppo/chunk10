  they are just `` among the oldest '' , not `` the oldest '' , as there is disputes about those dates . 
  what it seems to me from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht#history is that nijmegen was founded earlier . 
  do you have sources on who founded maastricht in 500bc ? 
  i took the countries from the list of sovereign states of europe , and the borders were n't clear to me so i just went with the list . 
  i take it is still appropriate to have a pic of it , as the city is still inhabited , most of the city is intact , and the reconstruction does represent the original one ? 
  or how do you feel about that pic ? 
  imgur did something i did not understand . 
  either mine of imgur 's bug . 
  corrected it !, 
  thanks for correcting !, 
  yes i had !, 
  i uploaded the pics , added them to the album , but something happened . 
  they are back now !, 
  the finnish city turku is my home town , so it 's not ignorance , but something strange happening . 
  something happening with imgur ( or me ) . 
  they were on the list , but i do n't know why they disappeared . 
  i even mentioned finland in the disclaimer , because it was in the list , but i do n't know how they fell out . 
  added them back . 
  thanks for noticing !, 
  what , oh god i missed rome !, 
  i have the image uploaded but imgur did n't include all of them for some reason . 
  thanks for noting !, 
  yea it says in the disclaimer that some of the years are the year the cities are first mentioned . 
  what i googled about vatican city was that the city of rome expanded it 's settlements to the area of vatican city in the first century . 
  before that it apparently was n't inhabited , as some emperor drained it in the first century . 
  i think i 'll add to the disclaimer that if some has better knowledge about some countries they should correct me . 
  i recommend everyone to try making these '' ____ of europe '' as it is a great way of getting to know different countries and cultures . 
  making this for example taught me a lot of history . 
  yea , i think there were several other cities that seemed by quick googling to be as old as rome or older , but i was hesitant to put them before rome . 
  after all , rome is * the eternal city * . 
  true . 
  these are what i came up with googling `` oldest city in x '' and lisbon and plovdiv are examples of cities that came up as `` oldest city '' specifically because of prehistoric urban settlement . 
  some other cities googled did turn up having ancient settlements , but as they did not appear to be urbanized to the point that the settlements were `` town-like '' i decided not to include them as oldest cities . 
  but yeah , it is immensely difficult to determine how old cities are . 
  / oldworldproblems, 
  i heard that some danes got mad that ikea named their carpets after danish places , which of course is insulting . 
  imagine a minefield set out by the danes . 
  beaches , backyards and other places where you are barefoot filled with lego . 
  not haaga . 
  never been to russia . 
  it 's only a matter of time !, 
  i can hear my elementary school teacher yelling for me for not knowing swedish !, 
   we export some pretty slick weaponry but they are neutral and peaceful weapons , right ? 
  oh , might be . 
  some people in finland think that it 's easy for sweden to reduce it 's military capacity because they have finland as a buffer against russia , so i just went on that thought line . 
  yea , that too , but i think the russian empire reached it 's strategic baltic sea goals by annexing finland , as that gave huge ports and harbors for russia in the west . 
  to me us troops going around other countries against other armies with political , not peacekeeping interests = war . 
  so no , i have n't been following when has the us actually declared war . 
  it 's almost like newspeak . 
  there is no war , only military operation . 
  there is no torture , only enhanced coercive interrogation technique . 
  there is no breach of citizen privacy , only national security measures . 
  and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg ) is how finland says `` thanks bro '' . 
  damn . 
  [ the strait between denmark and sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98resund ) . 
   yeah and the us has n't declared war since ww2 really ? 
  whoa . 
  wow , without finland as the ballsack , sweden looks even better endowed . 
  edit : finnish penis envy . 
  if you are implying that finland being a buffer between sweden and russia is the reason , i 'd like to note that denmark and sweden stopped warring without finland being in between . 
  mine is maybe over the top . 
  should have been just : `` forget what you think you knew : here 's what putin 's real goal , strategy and next moves are . '', 
  anyway , i 've just given up reading opinion pieces and analyses as most of them seem to be like * `` there has been a lot of speculating , and major correspondents and analysts have said this and this about putins true agenda and what he will do next . 
  however what they all fail to take in to consideration is this and this that is obvious . 
  i now present the * ** real ** * agenda and strategy putin has , because i am so much smarter '' * . 
  instead of journalism , it seems like a competition who writes the best backstory for putin . 
  if `` national dish '' here means a cherished and relatively common traditional dish of the country , then the finnish one is somewhat off . 
  m\u00e4mmi is only eaten during easter , and many people do not like it at all . 
  it 's reputation comes from its literally shitty looks which disgust foreigners more than it being especially cherished or being common . 
  it 's more known as a curiosity and joke like `` look we have this traditional food that looks like shit ! '', 
  than being relatively popular or liked traditional food . 
  here are some cherished and relatively common traditional dishes : [ karjalanpaisti ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xyj79f69zhk/uni9kuw2x0i/aaaaaaaaavw/g6ui-el1wcq/s1600/dsc_0615.jpg ) ( karelian hot pot ) [ hernekeitto ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-heuciwvcbsi/t0cuafs2iqi/aaaaaaaaips/erwv_0rt3rk/s1600/2012-02-18+15.13.29.jpg ) ( split pea soup ) [ uudet perunat ja silli ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfdfdzzgety/tfz-hrbvavi/aaaaaaaaaxw/bwoi-renf_e/s1600/dsc_7914.jpg ) ( dill seasoned young potatoes with herring ) [ poronk\u00e4ristys ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l2uzxnjd_hk/u14f-1ehldi/aaaaaaaabqg/xcttrwlppea/s1600/dsc_0257.jpg ) ( sauteed reindeer , mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam ) personally i hate it that that the more common traditional foods always get run over by `` ooh look this food looks like shit ! '', 
  like curiosity associated with m\u00e4mmi . 
  what happened to your sense of humor ? 
  geez !, 
  but i have the impression that danes drink a lot !, 
  you should start using some word for that . 
  if i remember danish correctly the word in danish would be something like `` gb\u00f8gh\u00e6ngborgbloorghab\u00f8\u00e6 '' . 
  it 's an opinion piece on nyt-liite , the weekend supplement/online publishment of helsingin sanomat . 
   but your cities look so ... medieval . 
  that 's because most of these cities are old . 
  rome was founded over a thousand years * before * the beginning of medieval age . 
  paris or london have existed for * two thousand * years . 
  the westminster abbey in london was already * 700 years * old then the us declared independence . 
  and most of these cities have been major cities for a long time . 
  there is so much history that the cities want to preserve the history . 
  the cities you mentioned mostly are young and have n't been large cities , so there is n't much history to preserve . 
  i would also guess that building skyscrapers was originally ( some hundred years ago ) more an american architectural thing ( with new york and chicago competing with them ) , and european nations were not that much interested in that . 
  just like art deco was mainly an american thing . 
  the heritage of skyscrapers lives on in the us while in europe has a heritage of old cities with church towers . 
  i myself have wondered why do american cities like providence even have skyscrapers , when the city is n't that big ? 
  it 's not about lack of development but rather a different focus in development . 
  in many cities , the skyscrapers are build some distance away from the older city . 
  [ like in paris ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/paris_night.jpg ) you can see that the older city with the eiffel tower is rather low rise and the skyscrapers are far away behind the eiffel tower . 
  so in some cities it is hard to get photo of both the old city and the new skyscrapers in the same picture . 
  or [ this photo of tallinn ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/24787891.jpg ) where you can see the high rise buildings being far in the left away from the old city with churches at the right ( and the building codes limit that skyscrapers can not be higher than the highest tower in the old town ) . 
  [ here 's another ] ( http://www.projects.aegee.org/suct/su2014/images/sus/hel1_4_helsinki.jpg ) view on helsinki from a direction not usually photographed . 
  [ and here 's my favourite skyline ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/southern_helsinki_panorama_2011-06-28_1.jpg ) of helsinki , from the tower hotel towards the sea . 
  edit : looking at helsinki and other cities , i never actually realized how present the sea is in helsinki compared to most other cities . 
  most are n't even on the coast , and helsinki is on a peninsula surrounded by the sea .
