  stockholm is similar . 
  i 'd say that in larger cities pussikalja is a quite established way of spending summertime for young people and adults alike . 
  it 's not necessarily beer , but generally just drinking alcohol and hanging out with friends in parks . 
  like picnic with mainly alcohol . 
  i find it odd that other countries do n't seem to have a word for that . 
  yea i did n't mean that as an argument on the nato-issue , more just explaining why finland thinks that our army without the support of nato is still useful against russia . 
  i think the reasoning is more like that even though russia could annihilate the finnish army ( russia has nukes for god sake ) , the finnish resistance would make it more difficult and costly for russia , therefore raising the threshold for invasion in crisis situations . 
  if finland had no army , it would be a much easier decision for russia to take military action against finland during intergovernmental crisis . 
   and if you did n't beat yourself with birch branches , it was n't proper . 
  well , i once beat myself with spruce branches while having a sauna . 
  while the idea seems painful , it was actually quite nice and gave a nice scent !, 
  * more in helsinki : * [ suomenlinna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomenlinna ) is a collection of old fortress islands just next to helsinki center . 
  it is a small city district , with people living there , so it is free to stroll there and spend time there . 
  it is easily accessible with a ferry every 15 minutes from the market square , and the ferry is part of public transport , so if you have a day ticket you can travel with that . 
  suomenlinna is an extremely popular picnic place for tourists and locals alike . 
  there are some small restaurants , but the main attractions are the old fortresses , walls , tunnels and grotto 's in the walls , hobbiton-like warehouses , and magnificent views to the sea . 
  on clear days one can see the highest buildings of tallinn , estonia on the other side of the gulf of finland . 
  the suomenlinna fortress is an unesco world heritage site . 
  [ seurasaari open air museum ] ( http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/seurasaari_openairmuseum ) has collection of traditional finnish wooden architecture from all around finland , and there 's a nudist beach !, 
  [ senate square ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_senate_square ) is the `` imperial center '' of helsinki , built during the russian autonomy as the monumental center for helsinki . 
  it has a strong resemblance to the architecture of st. petersburg , which used to be the capital of the russian empire . 
  the area near the senate square was used as a substitute for russia in american films during the cold war . 
  the senate square is right in the middle of helsinki and easily accessible . 
  [ the temppeliaukio church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temppeliaukio_church ) is a renowned modern church carved into bedrock , and has been described as a `` lair of a bond-villain '' . 
  it is in t\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 , close tho the city center . 
  one of the most popular destinations in helsinki . 
  [ punavuori ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punavuori ) is a district in central helsinki with lots of [ attractive jugend architecture ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n5dddljg2ws/uagudsebvoi/aaaaaaaaba4/itryxrenncw/s1600/shopping.jpg ) . 
  the area has a so called '' [ design district ] ( http://www.designdistrict.fi/news ) '' meaning small independent second hand shops , design boutiques and stuff like that so you can buy expensive design stuff , both new and vintage . 
  nearby is also the [ finnish design museum ] ( http://www.designmuseum.fi/en/ ) , focusing of course on finnish design . 
  [ kallio ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kallio_%28helsinki%29 ) is a district a bit north of helsinki center , but still part of the `` core city '' . 
  kallio used to be a working class scummy area , but now it is a trendy hipster place with young people , students , artists and hipsters , but still with the hobos and scumm wandering in the streets . 
  kallio has a lot of relatively cheap bars , and on weekends is pretty crowded . 
  the cheap bars are a bit run down , and then there are some bit more expensive hipster bars like [ siltanen ] ( http://www.siltanen.org/ ) . 
  many of the bars are karaoke bars , as finns are fond of karaoke , so please try out singing karaoke !, 
  many of the bars have english song lists . 
  the bars at kallio are mainly at helsinginkatu and vasankatu , both next to s\u00f6rn\u00e4inen metro station . 
  kallio also has two public saunas , [ arlan sauna ] ( http://www.arlansauna.net/ ) and [ kotiharjun sauna ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.com/showuserreviews-g189934-d262955-r136224607-kotiharjun_sauna-helsinki_southern_finland.html ) . 
  if finnish sauna is new to you , read some sauna etiquette from somewhere . 
  basically get naked and sweat and take showers in between sauna sessions . 
  then there are the obvious museums : [ the finnish national museum ] ( http://www.nba.fi/en/index ) about the history of finland . 
  [ ateneum ] ( http://www.ateneum.fi/en ) , the finnish national museum of art , focusing on finnish art from the past and then [ kiasma ] ( http://www.kiasma.fi/en/ ) , the finnish national museum of modern art .

  in capital region : [ nuuksio ] ( http://www.visitespoo.fi/visitors_guide/enjoy/nuuksio_national_park ) national park in the neighbouring city of espoo is a large area of relatively untouched nature some ten miles from helsinki . 
  the area is hilly and rocky , so it is spotted with lakes , ponds and swamps . 
  there are outdoor tracks to hike , some spots to make fire and places to swim . 
  if one does not have time to wander into the nature further in finland , nuuksio is an excellent place to experience finnish nature . 
  you can find more information also from [ here ] ( http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalparks/nuuksio/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  stay away from that monstrosity !, 
  kallio is the hipster district of helsinki with second hand shops , people having picnics , trendy cafes and ecological shops . 
  it used to be a scummy area , but gentrification has made it extremely trendy and hip . 
  of course there still are the scumm and villains present in kallio , but overall it 's a nice area . 
  never been to turkey . 
  i know that it 's a popular holiday destination and has an immense amount of history . 
  the opposition and demonstrations turks have had against erdogan is impressive and honorable in my opinion . 
  i would like to see turkey continue developing in the direction of atat\u00fcrks reforms and in the end joining the eu when the qualifications are met . 
  i really do n't see the difference in main religious heritage being obstacle in any way . 
  considering the history turkey has had with europe , i see it fitting as another country that has had war with neighbors an in the end cooperating with them , just like ( other ) eu nations . 
  and as the motto of the eu is `` united in diversity '' , i seriously can not see how any `` cultural differences '' can be a reason to ignore turkey . 
  as long as the democratic/human right/legislative/economical requirements are met , i 'm all in for turkey joining the eu . 
   i do not see oppression . 
  the laws banning `` homosexual propaganda to minors '' are oppressing . 
  it 's legal to have a sign saying `` it 's ok to be straight '' in public , but it 's illegal to have a sign `` it 's ok to be gay '' in public . 
  drones = usa , not eu . 
  nsa = usa , not eu . 
  `` glomal armament '' whatever that means = not eu , as the eu does not even have a common military defense policy . 
  guantanamo = usa , not eu . 
  snowden = usa , not eu . 
  martin luther king = usa , not eu . 
  you seem to be under the false assumption that the eu in the poster = the west . 
  the russian law equally is intolerant towards female homosexuals . 
  and i put lesbians there for the precise reason that it does not anger people , so people have to think why is it wrong for men to be gay but not wrong for women . 
  as a finn the german flag would feel vastly more alien than the poster i made . 
  i mean , the german flag is colored like a charred sausage with mustard and ketchup . 
  let 's then just rely on suspension of disbelief , 
  artistic urge . 
  the russia poster is not against the russian people , but against putin and his leadership . 
  is it wrong that people are critical towards him and his rule ? 
  not all portrayals of justice are blind , as apparently she being a virtuous maiden , her judgement is pure . 
  or that is how the london criminal court explains why that statue does not have blindfolds . 
  apparently justice originally was n't portrayed as blindfolded either . 
  not russian , but * about russia * . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oxdm0vc.jpg ) a finnish propaganda poster with the [ finnish maternity box ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2ac569/i_know_reddit_has_been_interested_in_finlands/ ) and [ simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ) . 
  welcome to the real world !, 
    you never said why art has to elevate people . 
   you never said why anything creative should be considered as art . 
  you are evading the question . 
  ** answer again : why does art have to elevate people ? 
  ** let me guess , you are again evading the question , refusing to anwser by asking questions from me ? 
  as if that would prove that your definition is right . 
  well , it does n't . 
  i already said to you that i used the word `` creative '' a bit erroneously as i was thinking in finnish a different word . 
  i did not mean that everything creative is art . 
  i just used a wrong word . 
   you never said why anything subjected to artistic review by the art world should be considered as art . 
  ** i said to you that there is no single definition of art , and the definition i gave you is my favorite one . 
  ** your reply ? 
  `` that 's one of the shittiest definitions i 've heard yet '' and still you have failed to give a better one , refusing to answer why art has to elevate people . 
  i gave you a source to george dickie , a professor emeritus of philosophy at the university of chicago , specializing in aesthetics . 
  you ignored it . 
   if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it , does it make a sound ?
