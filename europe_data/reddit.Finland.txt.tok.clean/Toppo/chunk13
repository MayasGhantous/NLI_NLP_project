  there 's this video art in our national museum of modern art where the artist slaughters a kitten with an axe and proceeds to masturbate on it . 
  you might not like it , you can think it is bad , but it is still art . 
  art can be bad . 
   putting aside that the italic part of the definition is circular thinking , creating something new does n't necessarily make is art . 
  sorry , i was thinking in finnish , where the word for `` creativity '' , or * luovuus * has a strong connotation with being artistic . 
   it is art when it matches the definition . 
  defining art is not easy , and there is no single definition of art , as that has been a matter of debate for decades , if not centuries . 
  my favourite definition i have read is the institutional theory of art , meaning art is anything that has been subjected to artistic review by the art world , including that the art world thinks the work sucks and does not elevate . 
  personally i call these propaganda , because i shamelessly attempted to convey a simplified message that uses strong symbols to evoke a strong emotional response . 
  or as the corporate world would call these , advertisements . 
  however my primary goal was not to make propaganda , but to try out my skills in the artistic genre of propaganda . 
  naturally it needs a subject that rather easily evokes strong emotions . 
  i can try !, 
   hope your poster is successful in breeding hatred like you intended . 
  the posters are about the eu as an institution and the russian government , not about the people . 
  unlike the original that inspired me , i specifically did not include russian & eu citizens , because russian government & putin = / = russian people , and european institutions = / = european people . 
  not all art elevates people . 
  of course , you can think that `` it 's not art because i do n't like it '' but that 's silly . 
  pretty much everything creative is art . 
  even nazi propaganda is art , even though morally questionable . 
  ukraine is independent of the eu , not under the authority of brussels , so the eu can not control ukrainians nor decide to sacrifice them , and the eu does not have the legal authority to intervene militarily what happens in ukraine . 
  you , of course , have the right to be wrong , but i wo n't dwell on this subject right now . 
  * many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our point of view *, 
  i did n't mean the title as `` eu & russian propaganda posters '' but `` propaganda posters about eu & russia '' . 
  this is the lady justice from the old bailey criminal justice from london . 
  it is n't blindfolded , as quote from wikipedia :  instead of using the janus approach , many sculptures simply leave out the blindfold altogether . 
  for example , atop the old bailey courthouse in london , a statue of lady justice stands without a blindfold ; the courthouse brochures explain that this is because lady justice was originally not blindfolded , and because her `` maidenly form '' is supposed to guarantee her impartiality which renders the blindfold redundant . 
  i just choose to go with the same design as the statue . 
  [ here 's the photo ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-scudsyhdzuk/uy_pxqs6rgi/aaaaaaaab_k/h_s6zbh4c3g/w702-h441-no/old_bailey_dk_al571585_qlsct3.jpg ) i used . 
  no , the eu is n't the only hope for peace . 
  but peace is something that the eu values comparatively much . 
  call it artistic urge if you will . 
  1 ) the eu side is about eu itself , not about their member states . 
  no institution of the european union has sent military to assist invasions . 
  the military of the uk is not the military of the eu . 
  2 ) yes , eu countries have participated in domestic surveillance . 
  eu institutions , to my knowledge , have not . 
  this is about eu , not individual eu nations , and as said , this is propaganda , a polished simplified image of the eu & russia . 
  3 ) putin 's no saint , but come on what ? 
  4 ) the red comes from [ the russian flag ] ( http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/4cb/4eq/4cb4eqkxi.jpeg ) : white , blue & red . 
  well , i 'm not going to arrest you and fine you for getting inspired , so sure , go ahead !, 
  thanks !, 
  the one i linked is the highest resolution i made , as this was mainly a fun project for the web . 
  still , the resolution should be fine for small posters . 
  while [ the piece that inspired me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lddgqek.jpg ) to do this does have ukraine in the middle thinking which side to choose , and this poster implies choices , i decided not to include ukraine , as i thought the priority for ukraine now is peace & sovereignty , and at this time & situation i did n't want to make a poster like `` ooh chose us !, 
  choose us ! '', 
  more from finland : `` on suuri sun rantas autius '' ( vast is the desolation of thy shore ) is one that i like , and in recent years it has been adapted internationally into a [ wonderful choral piece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp60g4rowik ) and [ here 's a more traditional version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k7uv3x_6f0 ) . 
  whoops !, 
  edit : many seem to have confused about the title . 
  admittedly i titled the link a bit incorrectly as english is n't my native language . 
  the poster about russia is not supposed to be shameless * russian * propaganda , but shameless critical propaganda * about russia * , while the eu is shamelessly positive about the eu institutions . 
  edit 2 : riding the top comment train : in comments below someone asked me to do a reverse propaganda poster with '' * putin riding a bear for russia and two homosexuals holding hands for eu * '' so [ i did this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kiwnrdz.jpg ) . 
  shameless again . 
  then in comments below i was asked to do a propaganda poster for finland so i did [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oxdm0vc.jpg ) with the [ finnish maternity box ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2ac569/i_know_reddit_has_been_interested_in_finlands/ ) and [ simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lddgqek.jpg ) was my inspiration and i thought `` heyyy i wan na play also ! '', 
  and because of you it still is `` eastern sea '' in finnish , even though it 's west from finland '_' should be `` western sea '' like in estonian . 
  whoa , thanks for the info !, 
  i hate it that midsummer is `` juhannus '' in finnish . 
  it 's so ... christian . 
  on the other hand , it 's kind of in-your-face to have a holiday with a christian name and supposedly a christian meaning and the way it is spent is being naked , intoxicated and perhaps having irresponsible random sex and doing pagan magic . 
  suck on that , christianity !, 
  oh shit i just realized that i will be in estonia on your midsummer . 
  arriving there on sunday evening and going to cycle around the country with my friends . 
  are the main celebrations on monday evening ? 
  in finland we celebrate midsummer on the friday of the week that the summer solstice is , so our midsummer celebrations were on last friday . 
  this means i will be celebrating midsummer twice . 
  i think we are going to rapla for monday evening . 
   drowning in lakes considering you do n't have as much lakes as in finland , you sure manage to prove your finnic culture !, 
  juhannus , while christian in name ( john the baptist , as an attempt to christianize the pagan holiday ) still remains largely a pagan holiday in finland and as said , it is one of the most important holidays , if not the most important . 
  while christmas is quite commercial nowdays , midsummer remains as a holiday that is actually really festive and fun . 
  for practical reasons the holiday is on the saturday of the week with the summer solstice , so if the solstice is on tuesday , the holiday is on saturday , with the main celebration being on the eve , friday . 
  most of the people attempt to get to countryside on summer cottages . 
  traditions are : - a lot of alcohol , barbecue and sauna is involved . 
  and as it is summer , the birches have branches and it is optimal to spank yourself and others in sauna with birch branches . 
  feels good man . 
  - bonfires everywhere . 
  the larger the better . 
  largest ones are several meters high , built from old boats and other junk . 
  - because of the amount of lakes and shoreline , it 's common for people , especially men to drown while drunk , with the cliche being the bodies found with the pants zipper open as the men have tried to take a piss while drunk and fall to the water and drown . 
  - pagan magic . 
  like women picking seven different wild flowers ( while naked and silent ) and putting them under the pillow and you are supposed to see your future husband in your dreams . 
  variant of that : run naked seven times around a well and you will see the reflection of your future husband in the well . 
  - combining the previous two to a `` magical foresight '' : if you stand up on a boat while drunk you will see your future widow on the shoreline . 
  - there 's also a morbid guessing every year : how many people will drown/die in total that midsummer - do stuff naked . 
  fuck , run on the fields in the night mist , swim , sauna , run some more naked in the misty fields , fuck , sauna . 
  - remember to be drunk - also , remember to be drunk ( wrote this here as an expanded info , so better seen than as an individual reply . ), 
  when did functionality and pragmatism become so ... booooooring ? 
  yay keynesian economics !, 
  that actually sounds nice . 
  you do n't need to have studied political science and sociology to know that . 
  being gay is enough . 
  does n't really differ from national days , loose coalition of individuals who happen to share a plot of land . 
  but people would * love * having two days free in a row !, 
  those lunatics tried to invade , occupy and conquer other nations and merge them with their own nations . 
  they did not try to create an union between nations , but to get other countries under their control . 
  other countries resisted -  wars . 
  eu is a voluntary cooperation so it can not be compared to invasions and conquests , as invasions and conquests by definition are against the will of another nation . 
  eu does not invade , occupy nor conquer anything , but nations join it at their own will if eu accepts them . 
  if a country decides to join the eu , why would it start a war against eu to prevent the join ? 
  it 's not a holiday here and it 's not a `` valentine 's '' day , but literally `` friends day '' , so the theme is more about friendship than love .
