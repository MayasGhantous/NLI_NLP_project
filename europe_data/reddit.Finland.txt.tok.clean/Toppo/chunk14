  then again , the issue was about `` a day for fucking everything '' so i guess fucking can happen between friends also . 
  nah ... a divided europe started world wars . 
  that reminds me of one of our former mp 's ( who passed away ) who suggested a law about `` love holiday '' ie holiday for fucking . 
  yes and apparently that 's the reason the flags are up today . 
  ah , i had forgotten that ikea commercial . 
  better than the one i had . 
  thanks !, 
  those are brilliant !, 
  wonderful !, 
  thanks !, 
  yes !, 
  now any french stereotypes ? 
  hairy armpit ladies ? 
  i just love the irony in finland that nuclear power war lobbied to help finland reduce dependence on russian energy , and now the largest single owner of one of the planned plants is the russian nuclear power/weapon state company rosatom , which is under kremlin control . 
   i just reminded everyone that nato is less of a burden on someone 's autonomy than certain other parties . 
  finland independently has chosen to have for example economic ties with russia because it is good for the economy . 
  economic relations usually are a `` burden '' on autonomy , especially considering globalization , but then again , economic relations are what often keep nations from going to war . 
  it is often better to have someone to trade with than someone to fight with .

  [ sisu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l-j2k3w0i8 ) !, 
   totally not someone 's puppet state and completely autonomous . 
  well , we have reasonably good relations with russia . 
  we have economic ties , outside the eu russia is the most important trade partner , russian tourists are an important contributor to finland , finnish companies do business in russia so there is no reason to spoil this just to prove that `` we are not a puppet state '' . 
  imagine if canada would say they are going to get nuclear weapons and aim them all to washington d.c. and new york . 
  of course it would have negative economic and political consequences , and it would be a stupid move , so why do it ? 
  to prove that canada is independent ? 
  no nation is an island , that is why have international relations and foreign policies . 
  our foreign policy is neutrality and having good relations with russia . 
  that does not mean we are a puppet state . 
  as sweden is the dick and finland the testicles , this is only natural . 
   finland shares similar history ( border ) with russia as a finn : argh . 
  replace the maypole and dancing with a sauna marathon and drowning in lakes & the sea and that 's basically a finnish midsummer . 
  oh god i 'm so glad that did n't work out . 
  i would just have hated the envious little brother feeling of finland towards swedish oil wealth . 
  this is my impression of the government , not the people : uk kind of has the same syndrome as russia has : longing for the past glory as a superpower , and the uk acts all bitchy within the eu because they want to hang on to the memories of the glorious british empire . 
  of course the uk does not do this with oppression and direct military action as russia does , but with political decisions , economics , military alliances and intelligence , where the uk kind of hangs around with the us hoping that the superpower status would spill to uk as well . 
  finns reacted quickly to this hilarity . 
  this militia-outdoor-second hand shop bought a bunch of old swedish rubble and one of them was a gingerbread cutter in the shape of a you know what . 
  after the swedish news they immeadetly ordered reproductions of those and made [ this ad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nys77obzg ) making fun of the swedish gingerbread cutter . 
  and they are apparently trying to get them [ for sale ] ( http://www.varusteleka.fi/fi/product/_3xh127gay ) for christmas ( swedes , notice the end of the link ) . 
  one magazine made a [ printable file ] ( http://nyt.fi/20131118-murskataan-natsit-tulosta-taestae-toehryjen-paeaelle-joulutorttu/?fb_action_ids=10151790829700949&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map= { % 2210151790829700949 % 22 % 3a550975341637532 } & action_type_map ={ % 2210151790829700949 % 22 % 3a % 22og . likes % 22 } & action_ref_map =[ ] ) so you can cover the swastikas you see on the streets or toilets or whatever places with the christmas star pastry . 
  of course people have started to make parodies like [ this also ] ( http://static.naamapalmu.com/files/7f/big/dzyokj4qwqtheip61mre.jpg ) . 
  let 's blame it on the ranking being made by an uk think thank , and the uk has this flirting thing with the us . 
  ** the most important ones : ** norway , overall score : 9,93 sweden : 9,73 iceland : 9,58 denmark : 9,11 finland : 9,03 ( at least we are above 9 : / ) - ** some comparisons : ** germany : 8,64 uk : 8,31 usa : 8,11 france : 8,04 russia : 3,39 - edit : [ source ] ( http://www.sudestada.com.uy/content/articles/421a313a-d58f-462e-9b24-2504a37f6b56/democracy-index-2014.pdf ), 
  i 've never lived there . 
  only in turku and the capital region ( which includes espoo ) . 
  as i 've understood chav 's are also adults . 
  jonnes are young teenagers , almost kids . 
  i do n't think they compare . 
  amis people ( short for * ammattikoulu * , vocational school ) used to be comparable , but i 'm not sure do they exist anymore to the extent they used to . 
  they stereotypically have a beer-branded cap , weak moustache ( called amis-moustache , or a more flexible translation , chav-moustache ) , a bit old jeans or tracksuit pants and a medallion with the finnish heraldic lion . 
  they like to fix cars and attract teen girls ( called pissis , short for * pissaliisa * or `` piss-lucy '' , alluding drunken teen girls who pee in public because they are underage and can not go to bars or anyone 's home ) . 
  their cars have fuzzy dice on the windshield , big speakers and this cruising and driving around is called * pussy cruising * . 
  the measure is n't just how much direct democracy there is , but overall on freedoms , participation and so on . 
  different categories influencing the overall score , and the differences : ** electoral process and pluralism : ** norway 10.0 , switzerland 9.58 . 
  ** functioning government : ** : norway 9.64 , switzerland 9.29 . 
  ** political participation : ** norway 10.0 , switzerland 7.78 . 
  ** political culture : ** norway 10.0 , switzerland 9.38 . 
  ** civil liberties : ** norway 10.0 , switzerland 9.41 . 
  eurovision is n't just the winners . 
  the whole circle jerk voting is political for example . 
  nordic countries voting other nordic countries and like greek competing with `` alcohol is free '' and the finnish song two years ago singing `` marry me '' and ending the performance with a same sex kiss , at the same time finland had a debate about same sex marriage . 
  there are tons of songs , performances and voting which have a political background or some message . 
   the more '' different '' something is , the better it has a chance to win . 
  or the more swedish it is . 
  i guess it depends if the referendum result is legally binding or if the government has the legal right to ignore it . 
  what ? 
  turku is an average city , fairly new looking as most of it burnt down under 200 years ago and then `` the disease of turku '' caused many old buildings to be demolished and now the city is mostly just [ gray blocks ] ( http://bsr2014.eu/wp-content/uploads/view_from_turku_cathedral_tower.jpg ) . 
  it 's rather small and uglier than photos make it appear . 
  weather is really crap most of the year , as it is in the southwestern corner of finland it is among the warmest places and has really shitty dark winters without snow . 
  it 's nothing . 
  that 's basically a large suburb mainly for upper middle class . 
  the structure is n't like a city . 
  it does not even have a proper city center . 
  there 's absolutely nothing to see really . 
  espoo is nothing without helsinki , for which it is a suburb for in essence . 
  espoo is like 90 % [ this ] ( http://mb.cision.com/public/197/9422238/9eef15ec684920d7_org.jpg ) . 
  meanwhile : finland has ordered a nuclear power plant from the russian nuclear state corporation rosatom , which will also be the largest single owner of the power plant in finland and deliver the fuel for it . 
  goddammit finland , i expected better from us :(, 
  hard to say . 
  if people who identify as lgb are like 2 % of the population , and out of those people one third voted for wurst , that 's 0,66 % of the whole population . 
  in order for 0,66 % of the population to have a major influence on the national voting , the amount of other people voting must be very small and divided . 
  lgbt people are a very small minority , and in conservative countries there are even less people who identify as lgbt and are part of the subculture . 
  i do n't think that matters on the voting that much . 
  well , i do n't think one can blame the liberal voters in conservative countries for the conservative people not voting . 
  they would need to have a swingstika . 
  well , as you said , it 's only the other hand . 
  on one hand conchita wurst is a drag character , and the whole point of drag shows is man performing as a woman . 
  while of course people will vote with the thought `` ooh i 'm so tolerant ! '', 
  drag shows as such are not based on those attitudes . 
  they do n't need those attitudes , while they can surely boost their popularity . 
  also the finnish punk band really does music , and punk in does have the element of protest , being unorthodox , fucking up with expectations . 
  many people in finland are n't like `` ooh they are a good band because i 'm so tolerant '' but more like `` retarded middle aged men singing punk about shitting ? 
  now that 's punk ! '', 
  i do know people vote as a statement . 
  lordi won because many voted it just as statement against the schlager pop eurovision , but on the other hand , the band is a genuine heavy metal band continuing the line of other metal bands with dramatic appearances . 
  i also think that the annual discussion `` this is not what eurovision should be about ! '', 
  is also a crucial part of eurovision !, 
  but what if people perceive the show to be good because of those reasons ? 
  it 's like youtube videos .
