  they 're just divided in opinions on economic sanctions . 
  yea , north korea seems doing good . 
  economy of japan is a bit stagnant . 
  and china is just industrializing , so it 's development can not be compared to industrialized countries . 
  china is going trough an economical phase we have passed already . 
  north korea and south korea have large tensions . 
  japan and china have large tensions . 
  china and taiwan have large tensions . 
   imagine four or five european superpowers , all of which have nuclear weapons * and are economically invested in each other to the point that war is unlikely . 
  * well , is n't that how the eu got started ? 
  dear god . 
  in [ some pictures ] ( http://static4.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/a_scale_large/200-2/photos/1266834079-the-duchess-of-alba-meets-victorio--lucchino-at-cibeles-madrid256592_256592.jpg ) she looks like oldman as [ mason verger ] ( http://www.scatchan.net/img/135355115143168.png ) . 
  there could be a travel ad for baltic and eastern european countries : * `` affordable !, 
  rich history !, 
  beautiful nature !, 
  not russia !, 
  ironically about the same objections were presented against impressionism . 
  i take it that what you actually meant is * a common secondary language * for those not natively speaking the language in question . 
  that is a different thing from `` one language '' or `` primary language '' . 
  `` one language '' means one language as opposed to several languages . 
  if eu were to have one language , it would not have several languages . 
  also , `` primary language '' is a different thing from common secondary language . 
  primary language is the mother tongue of the speaker . 
  it 's one thing to force people to learn * a second language * than force people to abandon their primary language and force a new primary language to them . 
  in finland 5 % of the population has swedish as their mother tongue . 
  it is no problem , because they also are fluent in finnish . 
  it would be utter nonsense to forbid them from learning and speaking swedish as their mother tongue and forcing finnish as their only language . 
   if you cant communicate with someone you are separate from them i can communicate with swedish speaking finns because they are bilingual and also speak finnish . 
  its mandatory for them to learn finnish , but it does not mean swedish is forbidden from them . 
  fyi the background behind the term `` men who have sex with men '' : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/men_who_have_sex_with_men, 
  well , two hours from tallinn there 's another more tolerant and progressive city : helsinki . 
  it 's easy to visit there from tallinn just for one day . 
  but what about * preventing improvements * in environmental standards , consumer rights , state power or strength of copyright ? 
  not if it 's a second language , no . 
  to me `` same language '' strongly implies that people do n't have different native languages any more , and [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2irdi6/what_should_eu_do_to_leapfrog_into_the_future/cl575gr ) seems to enforce that that 's what was implied . 
  what 's the problem of people being divided to speakers of different languages ? 
  deism claims that we can have sufficient amount of information to make a claim god exists . 
  agnostic theists can just have faith . 
  being different is not a problem . 
  being intolerant towards difference is . 
  the motto of eu is `` united in diversity '' . 
  goal should be to have people accept differences , not to erase them . 
  i do n't see why the language has to be the same . 
  forcing people to talk some language would be strongly against human rights , which are quite relevant for the eu . 
  after same sex civil partnerships became legal in finland in 2001 , the situation actually got more tolerant . 
  even the conservative christian party ( a small party ) is n't demanding to abolish civil partnerships , only saying `` that should be sufficient from the point of equality '' . 
  i would say no , because at least in finland , the cohabiting is nothing more than living together as a couple and some minor rights with that . 
  it is not a contract , unlike civil partnership . 
  you are in a civil partnership even though you live separately , but you can not live separately and cohabit . 
  i think the difference is that hungary and croatia has that in their constitution itself , not in the separate law that defines marriage . 
  if it 's illegal and straight marriage is not , people will care . 
   the reasoning is `` a civil union is a legal contract the state recognises , a marriage is a thing that has , on top of that , the blessing of society as large '' . 
  soo ... gay couples do n't get the `` blessing of society as large '' but straight couples do ? 
  is that what you are suggesting ? 
  that does n't really solve it for sexual minorities . 
  if marriage would be a purely religious affair , and as religions like hinduism , judaism , christianity , islam and others all were to have the right to call their things marriages , there would be nothing to stop people calling civil partnerships marriages . 
  so civil partnerships would end up being marriages any way . 
  if they reject it ( for foreigners : the proposal for same sex marriage comes from a citizen initiative from over 140 000 finnish citizen ) , i 'm curious to see will there be a new initiative , because we have parliamentary elections next spring and if the current initiative gets rejected , the new initiative will be voted by the new parliament . 
  i like them !, 
  i ` ts really nice that the design on the illustrative side is relatively modest , and does not have important heads ( although an axe wielding viking might have been cool ) . 
  and the pixelated side is very cool . 
  who cares if they look like pixels ? 
  it 's very fresh , bold and modest and at the same time aesthetically pleasing . 
   finnish makes you punctual and egalitarian that 's not what she said , but  that * may * have had * something * to do with our egalitarianism . 
  and * perhaps * the finns are known for their punctuality because their present and future take the same verb form . 
  speeches ( and essays also ) are often made to evoke thoughts and ideas , often based on metaphors , jokes , word plays and humor . 
  they are not solely to state claims of accuracy . 
  right after the quoted part she says :  and most of all it is wise to remember that santa claus 's native language is obviously finnish , or sami , which is also a finno-ugric language . 
  santa claus , you see , lives in our parts , on a high fell located in the borderlands of present day finland and russia , but luckily for your children , he is from the nordic countries , and is thus well-studied in many languages . 
  but obviously she does not claim santa claus to be real . 
  i think you are over analyzing the speech . 
  yea , that was what i was implying . 
  it 's a borrowed word that does not tell about the relationship of languages . 
   is n't the difference much lower when pronounced ? 
  i am fairly sure cilim\u00e9adair must sound fairly close to kilometer . 
  kilometre ( uk english spelling ) is `` kilometri '' in finnish , one letter difference , and finnish is utterly and completely unrelated to english . 
   that 's just to get someone to drink the last batch of lukewarm coffee left in the pot . 
  and nobody drinks it , an the coffee remains there , and no one makes new coffee because `` oh , there 's still the old coffee , but i do n't want to drink it '' . 
  i 'd guess that if you drink a lot of coffee and build tolerance and dependence , you need it to feel normal . 
  if you do n't get your evening coffee , you feel unease and tense and do n't get sleep . 
  i heard that some people heavily addicted to amphetamines also take amphetamines before going to sleep . 
  yes , but as the original news article says , it 's because people from other countries then go to luxembourg and buy the coffee they imported :  number one in terms of per capita consumption is the wild card luxembourg . 
  their 24 kilos a year is however largely explained by a vigorous cross-border trade with its neighbours . 
  germany is full of coffee drinkers eager to buy inexpensive coffee grounds from across the border . 
   i find it fascinating why estonians have their shit together in comparison to latvians . 
  is it due to exposure to finland ? 
  finland is years behind estonia on digital developement . 
  we should learn from our tech savvy little brother . 
  makes it taste better , or prevents the taste from getting worse . 
  i do . 
  the cold temperature slows down the spoiling of the fatty acids in coffee . 
  [ relevant finnish beer ad , saying `` spare the water for the fishes '' . 
  i think that in finland there 's a general stereotype that southern europe has a rich caf\u00e9 culture . 
  i had those !, 
  * worst pain ever . 
  * they had to give me lots of iv painkillers because i was screaming and twitching in agony . 
  it was just a cheesy joke . 
  i actually do that regularly . 
  we even had a shared cinnamon sprinkler in my previous job to use on coffee . 
  with that amount of beans ...
