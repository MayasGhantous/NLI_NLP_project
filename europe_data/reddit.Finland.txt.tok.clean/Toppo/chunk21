  i can not help it . 
  in finland it is commonly suggested that the basic income is simply funded by increasing tax rates . 
  so if now your monthly salary is 3000 $ and you pay 800 $ taxes , your net income is 2200 $ . 
  with for example 700 $ basic income from the same salary 1500 $ is taxed away , but you get 700 $ of basic income , resulting that your net income is 2200 $ . 
    it takes hundreds of years for that forest to return to its original condition  not really . 
  it wo n't look the same maybe , but the plantlife and wildlife will not even leave the area during modern forestry . 
  some of it will die , as a lot of species require old growth forests with abundance of aging and rotting wood to survive . 
    it 's not about recreational forests , but about biodiversity in general . 
  the finnish forest biodiversity has suffered greatly from forest industry . 
   i think you might need a scientific source for that . 
  my sources are in finnish , but here you go : http://duodecimlehti.fi/web/guest/arkisto?p_p_id=article_war_dl6_articleportlet&amp;viewtype=viewarticle&amp;tunnus=duo70531&amp;_dlehtihaku_view_article_war_dlehtihaku_p_auth=#s4, 
  so , my finnish friend who was born abroad to finnish parents on a business trip would not get basic income ? 
  hush now , do n't spoil the impression the map gives . 
  well to the luck of you , we also have the [ freedom to roam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam#finland ) . 
  i was thinking an incorrect finnish translation in my head , `` mets\u00e4hakkuu '' , forest logging . 
  so what i meant was that logging of forests is still a problem in finland . 
  well it does have [ prettier hills and views ] ( http://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/destination/lake-district-133324.jpg ) than the [ too flat finnish lake district ] ( http://www.discoveringfinland.com/ftp/mikkeli/saimaaphoto.jpg ) . 
  i was thinking more like how a place called `` lake district '' is a national park in the uk while the amount of lakes is dwarfed by the amount of lakes in relatively normal finnish landscape not even a national park . 
  so i 'm kind of teasing you like an sibling would tease their ( european ) brother :d if it 's any consolidation , norway has more lakes than finland . 
  i do n't think the population has any relevance , but you do have superior coastlines , i give you that !, 
  cutting down old forests is deforestation , so it still is an issue . 
  the fact that wood mass is increasing in what one might call pine plantations does not negate that old growth forests is logged . 
  it takes hundreds of years for that forest to return to its original condition . 
  the methods of keeping active animal life in finland has not been successful . 
  as i said , 25 % of the forest animals species in southern finland have disappeared due to forest industry . 
  it 's not about recreational forests , but about biodiversity in general . 
  the finnish forest biodiversity has suffered greatly from forest industry . 
  but i 'm only speaking about finland . 
  i do n't know about sweden . 
  in finland we have a governmental agency , `` administration of forests '' whose job is both to conserve forests and supply wood for the need of forest industry ( edit : from the land owned by the government , which is a lot ) , so it has conflicting interests to both protect forests and log them which for several times have caused outrage , like the administration of forests logging down forests [ in this way ] ( http://uusi.voima.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/big_fimage172.jpg ) in a place awarded for distinguished recreational forest in finland . 
  except deforestation is still an issue , at least in finland . 
  it 's not that they are cutting down forests in general , it 's that they are cutting down old growth forests hundreds of years old to make toilet paper and newspaper . 
  in southern finland , 25 % of the forest animals have dissappeared due to forest industry , and in the whole finland , less than 5 % of forests are natural old growth forests . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ogleilc.jpg ) on how forestry industry has deforested old growth forests ( dark green ) in northern finland and [ here 's the difference in practice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kdv75gd.jpg ) . 
  there have been cases when the local tourist industry has paid money for the forestry government to not cut down old growth forests important for tourism .

  some people manage to quit heroin addiction alone , like some can quit alcohol addiction alone . 
  most can not , and need help . 
  it 's unfortunate that our society does n't seem to acknowledge that much how dangerous alcohol can be , that it is a psychoactive drug like heroin , dxm and cannabis . 
  it 's because it is so immersed in our culture , for being legal that people handle it in a separate mental category from `` drugs '' and do not associate alcohol carries the same risk as many other drugs . 
   well those who are in the streets and refuse/get kicked out of institutions trying to help them are kinda lost to me point kind of was that u/marchewajp said * `` yeah , it 's not like they can already have all the help they need . 
  they only need to stop drinking '' * , implying that alcohol dependence is not something they need help with . 
  point was that not all people on the streets necessarily receive help to alcoholism . 
  so you can not label all alchoholists on the street as people who refuse/get kicked out of institutions . 
   and no , when you try heroin , you get addicted because you feel weak and bad and painful when the effects stops and you ca n't reasonably stop alone because it 's too hard . 
  with alcohol it 's easier , you can do it by yourself with a bit of determination . 
  no , with heavy alcohol dependence ** you can die without medical care * if you stop it `` by yourself '' . 
  and saying one can get rid of alcoholism with `` a bit of determination '' is a hell of an understatement . 
   what i mean is that with alcohol you can decide to stop same can be said of heroin . 
  you only need a bit of determination . 
  you fail to realize that alcohol , like heroin , is a physically addictive substance that causes changes in central nervous system and elsewhere in your body , and with heavy addiction , you feel weak and painful when the effects stops and you ca n't reasonably stop alone because it 's too hard . 
   just saw your other post , are you sure about alcohol withdrawal ? 
  i 've never heard of things like that , but if you 're right i retract what i said ... see for example [ this article on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome ) . 
  alcohol withdrawl sydrome is classified under `` critical care medicine '' , which then is defined ( in wikipedia as ) `` a branch of medicine concerned with ** the diagnosis and management of life-threatening conditions requiring sophisticated organ support and invasive monitoring ** '' . 
  in addition from the alcohol withdrawl syndrome article : * `` some withdrawal symptoms can linger for at least a year after discontinuation of alcohol . 
  symptoms can include a craving for alcohol , inability to feel pleasure from normally pleasurable things ( also known as anhedonia ) , clouding of sensorium , disorientation , nausea and vomiting or headache . 
  for vowels , its for a large part the result of writing system where usually one letter corresponds to one sound . 
  if english were written like that , `` bad '' would be written `` b\u00e4\u00e4d '' , `` dude '' would be written like `` duud '' , `` fruit '' would be written like `` fruut '' , `` letters '' would be `` let\u00f6\u00f6s '' and `` where '' would be `` wheer '' , roughly speaking . 
  english does have words like smooth , pool , good , soon , deed , sheep and so on though . 
  i can only translate from this , which is the finnish version of it :  arvoisa h\u00e4\u00e4pari ja h\u00e4\u00e4vieraat . 
  it goes like this : * dear newlyweds and wedding guests . 
  it is customary in estonia to give advice to a young couple . 
  that is why i 'll say a few words . 
  this couple has heartfelty waited for the commitment of marriage . 
  but the journey to marriage is a thousand miles . 
  because it is a large step for a person , good advice will make the journey easier . 
  * * so groom , remember , marriage should be cherished with love and intelligence , but not with force . 
  the happiness of marriage can be read from the number of dimples of the wife . 
  planning is the foundation of action , but love will take you to the end . 
  friendship has to be nurtured at all times and love cherished continuously . 
  * * and bride , see , love is like age , it is impossible to hide it . 
  because your loved one has a lovely laugher , you will get a good companion for life . 
  the grooom has his will , but the bride has her means . 
  may happines rain for them always and forevermore . 
  examples of finnish : [ finnish news broadcast in more formal finnish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwpwdjnph00 ) [ spoken finnish interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blcgcov263u ) [ finnish soft ballad song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0p_u1w89a ) [ finnish punk song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnwhj6z7wb09 ), 
  i hate that language . 
  as i always describe it , it sounds like an unreliable person is lying to you/sucking up while at the same time balancing a rotten oyster on his tongue . 
  how about minas morgul and minas tirith ? 
  but that 's only a tallinn thing , not helsinki thing . 
  linn was originally `` linna '' as it still is in finnish . 
  that 's why for example the genetive of linn is `` linna '' , not `` linnu '' or `` linno '' , because the original genetive was `` linnan '' , as it still is in finnish . 
  but in southwestern finnish dialects , which are closest to estonian language , the genetive for `` linna '' is simply `` linna '' , with the difference being in intonation . 
  i just thought because in finnish - us is a clitic meaning roughly `` one of these '' . 
  like talo ( house ) -  talous `` economy '' ( kind of like how one household is one economy ) , koira ( dog ) -  koiruus `` mischief '' , lupa ( permission ) -  lupaus `` a promise '' . 
  and so we have linna ( castle/fort ) -  linnoittaa ( to fortify ) -  linnoitus `` fortress '' . 
  does the ending - us have some meaning ? 
  eesti can into nordic . 
  my summer experience in western estonia was very finnish . 
  fields , forests and dirt roads . 
  some random estonians came to talk to me and my friend and asked us to join them to sauna , so we jumped in their car and went into their summer cottage to drink , sauna and swim . 
   their language is more similar to finnish than latvian or lithuanian . 
  that 's a bit understatement . 
  estonian is n't related to latvian or lithuanian at all . 
  they are completely different language groups . 
  `` talsinki '' sounds horrible in finnish . 
  `` talsia '' is a verb for trampling / walking and the suffix - inki has somewhat the meaning `` happening related to this '' . 
  so talsinki sounds like `` the trampling happening '' . 
  hellinn would be nicer , as it 's almost identical to finnish word `` hellin '' , * the most gentle * or * i caress/tender * . 
  and if it would be hellinna in finnish ( like tallinn is tallinna ) it would be pretty much like `` hell castle '' , even though the hell would be english there . 
  there 's not really that big difference in culinary .
