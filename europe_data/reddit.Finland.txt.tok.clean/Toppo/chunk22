  some local specialities in market places , but overall people eat the same in the whole country . 
  and i think the negative attitude towards sweden originates more from the mandatory swedish in schools , which is seen utterly useless in eastern finland . 
  also according to a myth the swedish flag originates from finland , when some king crusading in finland saw a golden cross on the blue sky . 
  `` linn '' originally meant castle/fort . 
  this is till evident in finnish , where `` linna '' means castle/fort and finnish preserves the older name of tallinn , * tallinna '' , literally `` tal castle '' , probably referring to [ toompea castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toompea_castle ) in tallinn . 
  in estonian `` linna '' developed like - burg in german , to mean a settlement instead of castle/fort . 
  * rahvas * in finnish means something like `` uncivilized commoner '' , while in estonian it means `` the people '' or something like that . 
  which reminds me . 
  i 've seen this wedding speech supposedly in estonian , which is written to be as humorous to finns as possible :  auline tuplapulma , aulinet naimarahvas . 
  when translated how finns could understand that , it 's like this : * dear double trouble , dear uncivilized copulating commoners . 
  making mating hustle easier for the double trouble has always been the way in estonian hut hoods . 
  i 'll babble an example of copulating layout from my ass . 
  with lusty eyes , this double-touble has practiced the zenith of copulation chores . 
  copulating chores could be like a thousand penis-bent footpaths . 
  when there 's a great danger of tumbling , a firm grab is for the luck of copulation . 
  * * so copulation-boy , remember these tips . 
  while copulating , you must bustle with caressing and knob , not with your body . 
  the amount of copulation chores can be decuded from the total amount of laugher pits of the copulation-virgin . 
  foreplay may be setting the slippiness the lovemaking hag goes to bed . 
  leching needs tapping without a pause and making love needs the continuous scratching of the hairy crack . 
  * * so copulating virgin , look . 
  making love is like breasts , what bra should you tuck them into . 
  when making love makes you moan , ( something ) will become a hardy bed pounder . 
  the one who scratches the chest hair of the copulation-boy always desires to fool the bagging trouser guy with hag ways . 
  and may kids trickle to you always and continuously . 
  the word `` slave '' is an interesting one . 
  the very word `` slave '' comes from slavic people , as they commonly were slaves . 
  on the other hand the finnish and estonian words for slave `` orja '' & `` ori '' come from the indo-european word `` aryan '' . 
  and while other countries refer russia as , well , russia , in finnish and estonian the cognate word means sweden , ( ruotsi & rootsi ) . 
  to add : finnish has vowel harmony , meaning that in native words it 's impossible to have vowels a , o & u in the same singular word as \u00e4 , \u00f6 & y. 
  so in `` kokkoko '' it 's - ko , but for example in `` sy\u00f6tk\u00f6 '' ( are you eating ? ), 
  the question clitic is - k\u00f6 , because `` sy\u00f6tko '' violates vowel harmony . 
   that 's not drinking that is the problem , it 's often the consequences of debts , depression etc. . . 
  same can be said of heroin use . 
  you fail to recognize that another problems can cause new problems , like substance dependence ( alcohol / heroin ) . 
   we should focus on educating people on their finance and self esteem to keep them from falling in dangerous situations that does n't help those already addicted to alcohol / heroin and living on the streets . 
   it 's not like heroin that prevents your body from feeling good on it 's own after you 're addicted just like with heroin , in worst cases , yes it is . 
  alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures , hallucinations and even kill people . 
  to add : * ep\u00e4j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llistytt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6myydell\u00e4ns\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00f6h\u00e4n * is grammatically correct artificially created non-compound word demonstrating extreme agglutination . 
  * kumarreksituteskenteleentuvaisehkollaismaisekkuudellisenneskenteluttelemattomammuuksissansakkaankopahan * is another grammatically correct artificially created non-compound word demonstrating extreme agglutination . 
  * h\u00e4\u00e4y\u00f6aie * is a compound word with the longest string of vowels . 
  i think it 's also made up just for fun , although the meaning `` wedding night intention '' is said to be an euphemism to have sex on wedding night . 
  * solutomaattimittaamotulos * or `` result from cell tomato measuring place '' is a palindrome . 
  * nuutti-vaari oksensi bisnes-koiraa vittuun * , or `` granpa nuutti vomited into the pussy of a business dog '' is another palindrome * tissit , tosi isot tissit * , or `` boobs , really big boobs '' is yet another palindrome . 
  which is the intention to have sex . 
  there can be some instances also when caretakers and other service providers treat lgbt people with disrespect . 
  finland is relatively tolerant , perhaps not on the same level as denmark , but i 've heard incidents in finland when some therapeutic massager refused to treat a woman because she was a lesbian , some school principle refusing ad for lgbt teens in their note board because `` our school does not have lgbt people '' or when a gay patient asked for std tests , including hiv test the doctor refused the hiv test saying `` it 's not for you , only for gay people '' , ignoring the possibility the patient in question is gay . 
  many professionals have studied their profession decades ago , when lgbt people had much less acceptance , and this can still show . 
  while ideally also every professional would know how to handle different sexual and gender identities equally , in practice it is not the case . 
  lgbt friendly elderly home is like a guarantee that at least in this place you can trust that you are understood and accepted . 
  your choice of question seemed to imply that if normal elderly homes also take lgbt people and provide adequate care , there 's something wrong with a lgbt-friendly elderly home , as you did n't for example ask are the residents of other elderly homes accepting and tolerant , and is it easy for lgbt people to be openly themselves in other elderly homes . 
   if everything is not exactly as they want they are oppressed or whatever . 
  it 's completely reasonable to have an elderly home with the policy that lgbt people should be able to be themselves and as open * in the same way straight people already can be * in normal elderly homes . 
  the point of the elderly home is just to have an environment * straight people already have * . 
  and now , when things are not exactly as you want , you start whining how other people are annoying for wanting a same kind of golden years straight people already have . 
  so no , lgbt people are not annoying . 
  you are annoying . 
   do the other elderly homes ban lgbt people ? 
  do they not provide adequate care ? 
  no , but the fellow residents , who you have to live with because of you need care in an elderly home , do n't necessarily give you the adequate treatment as a human being . 
  elderly people are more conservative than average . 
  imagine living your entire life hiding your sexuality , and because of homophobic fellow residents , you have to keep hiding a large part of yourself when you should be enjoying your golden years . 
  also note that the elderly home mentioned still takes straight people there too . 
  so it 's more like lgbt friendly elderly home . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  what 's your magic spell to turn elderly people in normal elderly houses into tolerant and accepting ? 
  also note that the elderly home mentioned still takes straight people there too . 
  so it 's more like * lgbt friendly * elderly home . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  how is the lgbt elderly home `` special treatment '' when normal elderly homes in practice already are the same kind for straight people ? 
  why should straight people get special treatment , one could ask ? 
  also note that the elderly home mentioned still takes straight people there too . 
  so it 's more like lgbt friendly elderly home . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
   get better friends . 
  well , that 's what this lgbt elderly home is about , getting a better elderly home for lgbt people . 
  many elder people are still strongly homophobic so being openly yourself in a heterosexual dominated elderly home can be a burden . 
  alcoholism is a medical condition with icd diagnostic classification . 
  if one is an alcoholic , one does not simply stop drinking . 
  those people commonly need help to stop drinking . 
   you think the line `` may god have mercy on the people of kiev '' is equivalent to `` i hate gays '' ? 
  partly . 
  `` may god have mercy on the people of kiev '' is based on the premise that hipsters in some way are harmful , nuisance , cause something bad , overall hipsters being a negative thing . 
  just like `` i hate gays '' is based on the premise that homosexuality itself is a negative thing . 
   go and preach to someone that actually cares . 
  i 'll preach as long as you reply to my comments , as you obviously care enough to continue replying . 
  `` kunta '' translates to municipality . 
  helsinki is also a kunta . 
  kunta is merely the term for the administrative unit . 
  it 's not dependent on the size . 
  you kind of missed the point . 
  with some people really hating hipsters , there was no way for me of knowing were you joking or not . 
  like if someone says just `` i hate gays '' , there 's no knowing is that just a joke or serious hate , as there really are people who hate gays . 
  in those situations , it 's understandable if someone lectures about hate towards gays . 
  and it 's silly then to complain `` please stop lecturing me , i 'm going to continue to make jokes regardless of this whining '' . 
  the finnish lake area is called `` j\u00e4rvi-suomi '' or `` lake-finland '' . 
  it 's translated commonly as finnish lake district or finnish lakeland . 
  iirc the northernmost part of finland actually has more lakes than the finnish lakeland . 
  the seemingly separate lakes of lakeland often are one and the same lake which just has a very irregular shape with small sounds connecting the larger bodies each other . 
  for example saimaa , the largest lake in finland ( and one of the largest in europe ) and the largest lake in the comment above is [ like this ] ( http://finland.fi/picture_book/saimaa/content/pics/saimaa_map.jpg ) .
