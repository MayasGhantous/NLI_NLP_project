  in northern finland the lakes are very small and separated by fells , so up there the lakeland is [ like this ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/vx1c3 ) . 
  and iirc , for this reason norway actually has more lakes than finland . 
  but they are mostly small mountain lakes . 
  lol @ the `` lake district '' in england . 
  by the population amount , technically yea , but the structure of espoo is n't really city like . 
  there 's not really city-like center , rather four larger suburban hubs ( espoon keskus , lepp\u00e4vaara , tapiola , matinkyl\u00e4 ) which all are built around highways leading to helsinki and ring roads going around helsinki . 
  well , at least third of the alcohol sales in estonia are attributed to finnish tourists , so there 's some compensation !, 
  other than that , finland has a lot of estonian workers who then go back to estonia where they live permanently and then use their money mainly in estonia , so that 's some compensation too . 
  the finnish language , like many other languages , does not have separate words for cities and towns so in theory , `` kaupunki '' can be translated also to town . 
  finland officially has 107 `` kaupunkis '' . 
  their status with the english word `` city '' is n't official , but customary . 
  it 's not a joke to everyone . 
  there 's tons and tons of people who genuinely hate hipsters . 
  and to tons and tons of people , `` hipster '' does not refer only to fashion style , but also to lifestyle and people . 
  a person , not their clothes is hipster . 
  kind of like the dude in the us who said he 'll kill himself if gays get to marry . 
  your life , your loss . 
  this online hipster hate has gotten just ridiculous . 
  and the strangest thing is that hipsters hate is often justified by blaming hipsters of being condescending and judgmental towards others . 
  `` look at that guy . 
  he has a beard , skinny jeans and ironic obscure band shirt . 
  obviously he 's a condescending and judgmental hipster so it 's okay judge him . '', 
  this is around geographic center of helsinki : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/lehmi%c3%a4_laitumella_helsingin_viikiss%c3%a4.jpg, 
  rich people wanted a municipality of their own . 
  hence kauniainen . 
   it was a bizarre phenomenon that occured because urban white people in the us realized that their lives were vacuous . 
  so they started searching for `` authenticity '' and wound up fetishizing the past in weird ways . 
  i do n't find it bizarre at all . 
  i think it 's a perfectly normal reaction and i see it completely fine that if people have an unpleasant feeling of some of the elements in their life , they react to it . 
  and what i think it means is that urban white people got tired on how everything in their life was readily planned and offered for them . 
  what kind of food they will eat , what kind of clothes they should wear , what kind of music they should listen , what kind of movies they should watch . 
  all of the mostly dictated by large companies , making the white urban people feel impersonal . 
  so they started searching for `` authenticity '' , looking at the past , seeing what interesting stuff the past has to offer with respect to fashion , music , movies , games and so on . 
  result being that thrift stores , second hand , retro , vintage all of them becoming more popular and stuff . 
  so instead of large companies telling people what they should wear , listen and see , they started choosing themselves what to wear , listen and see . 
  so they fetishise the past , homeless , lumberjacks , electodisco , old consoles and such because it was their own choice , not something dictated by the fashion , music or movie industry . 
  the huge variety of strangeness among hipsters is a result of that it did not origin from a single source . 
  and fashion industry then saw this hipster thing was bubbling , it adopted it into their products and it became mainstream fashion . 
  beards , plaid shirts , large glasses and such became mainstream , because companies wanted to capitalize on the non-mainstream bubbling `` hipster culture '' . 
  hipster look is completely mainstream already , and one can not really say someone is a hipster just because of their looks . 
  what is bugging is how the media has started treating everyone who has a mainstream fashion sense as hipster , and label every new fad as hipster . 
  like `` dadbod is the new hipster body '' , `` clean shaven is the new hipster '' , `` neo nazi is not a hipster thing '' . 
  like every new urban fad is called `` hipster '' . 
   i 'm sorry that its effects linger in europe . 
  you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  speaking from a hipster district in helsinki , the result of `` hipster culture '' is more interest towards smaller local producers of clothes , food , beer , entertainment and such . 
  this has resulted in more local smaller producers and grassroots events , people having more choice and acceptance towards different fashion styles and so on . 
  imo the hipster phenomena in general has resulted in people looking alternatives for what the large companies offer , and i think it 's a good thing . 
  that really depends on the country and culture . 
  finland has what one would say hipsters . 
  finland has only three starbucks , two of them in the airport . 
  the hipsters in finland live on their own in districts like [ kallio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kallio ) which is filled with individual cafes and restaurants , not chains like starbucks . 
  do n't be so judgmental . 
  seems you just have read from the internet what hipsters should be like and make nice generalizations . 
   snootiness is annoying and a lot of hipsters are snooty . 
  that really depends on the region and culture . 
  i 've noticed that in finland many people perceive so called hipsters as snooty just because hipsters like `` alternative '' mainstream stuff and perceive their dislike of other stuff as snooty . 
  if a `` average '' person says they do n't like green tea or raw chocolate , it 's generally fine , but if a hipster says they do n't like mcdonald 's or normal drip coffee , they get blamed for being snooty . 
  as if hipsters do n't have to right to not like something . 
  but generally finland does n't even have the kind of negative atmosphere towards hipsters that seems to be common in the us for example . 
  in finland the people who acknowledge the existence of the hipster concept tend to be hipster like themselves . 
  it 's hardly the fault of the hipsters . 
  in meanwhile , [ the middle point of helsinki ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/lehmi%c3%a4_laitumella_helsingin_viikiss%c3%a4.jpg ) . 
  it 's like a network of suburbs separated by some fields , highways and smaller residential areas . 
   so , how many mega-cities are there , according to you ? 
  let 's go back a bit . 
  you originally said there 's perhaps one * actual city * in europe . 
  you originally did n't speak about `` mega-cities '' . 
   i do n't know why people get offended by this all the time , but a regional center of 150 to 200 thousand people is not a city , it 's a larger town . 
  there 's no actual universal definition between a `` town '' and a `` city '' other than town is generally smaller than city . 
  what the actual size requirements are , has not been defined . 
  so people `` get offended '' because you are trying to impose your personal subjective opinions as truths , often against the common language usage and common understanding of other people . 
  from wikipedia :  a city is a large and permanent human settlement . 
  so you are saying europe does n't have more than one ( if any ) large and permanent human settlements ? 
  i think op refers to the geographic center of vantaa . 
  tikkurila , the place you linked , is on the [ southern border of the municipality ] ( http://www.aluesarjat.fi/kartat/.%5cvantaan_kaupunginosat.jpg ) , bordering helsinki . 
  funny , as the original name of vantaa is `` helsingin maalaiskunta '' :d, 
  yea , as the habit is confined to metros and helsinki has the only metro in finland , so those outside the capital region are not familiar with it . 
  interestingly , going further back in time , the cross of st. andrew is what sparked the evolution of the finnish flag . 
  imperial russia adopted the cross of st. andrew as a naval flag ( blue cross on white base ) , which then was rotated 45 degrees to serve as the flag of the st. petersburgh yacht club , which was then copied to the finnish yacht club , which then evolved into the flag of finland . 
  soo , basically [ this happened ] ( http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/415544/5082948/1260951403247/horizons-mural-rober-mccall.jpg?token=phspvatsg2t5xuh1moabv97pn%2bi%3d ) . 
  second link is broken . 
  the coat of arms of finland proper looks like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southwest_finland#/media/file:varsinais-suomen.vaakuna.svg ), 
  hey man that 's just not cool . 
  god drops a flag in estonia and danes steal it as dannebrog . 
  god paints a golden cross to the finnish sky and swedes steal it . 
  in the helsinki metro it is the norm to stand on the right side and let those in a hurry to pass you from the left side . 
  they even have signs to tell you to stand on the right side . 
  yes there is international waters between finland and estonia . 
  doable ? 
  yea . 
  agains international law ? 
  yea . 
  no , as russia still has connection to the international waters north of kunda . 
  also i believe international law of the sea & other international treaties guarantee access to international waters for countries which do n't have any natural access . 
  it 's not strictly territorial waters , as the exclusive economic zone is not considered territorial waters . 
  for example [ in this map ] ( https://www15.uta.fi/fast/fin/mil/images/ps-surv5.jpg ) you can see that there 's a strip of international waters between finland and estonia . 
  known as in `` police has released information on the motive '' or known as in `` i believe it is like this so it must be like this '' ? 
  well , if the motive is unknown , there is no reason to tell the skin color of the stabber and victims . 
  they do n't know if the incident has anything to do with skin color , so there 's no reason to publish the skin color as if it were relevant .
