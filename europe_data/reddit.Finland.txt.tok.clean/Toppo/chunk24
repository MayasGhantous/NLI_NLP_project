  aww crap . 
  it 's `` genetiivi '' in finnish . 
  i think for majority of finns wwii is viewed simply winter war , winter war , the spirit of winter war , independence saved , glorious veterans , sisu , winter war , some cooperation with germany due to desperate situation , goddamn germans burnt lapland . 
  but sisu and winter war . 
  which is a pity since reality naturally was n't that simple . 
  i think it is helsinki slang/dialect , but over 100 years old to my knowledge . 
   fun fact 2 : the genitive and partitive cases of `` kali '' are `` kalja '' -- same as the word for beer in finnish . 
  fun fact galore : i just wrote for the reason for that [ in this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g6069/how_to_say_beer_in_all_european_languages/ctvak47 ) . 
  some of my interest in estonian language comes from that i 'm very fond of my home dialect of southwestern finland , and it 's the finnish dialect closest to estonian language with some similar features to estonian and some could claim it would be a bit easier for me to understand estonian . 
  i wrote about that just a moment ago in [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g6069/how_to_say_beer_in_all_european_languages/ctvcdns ) . 
  but yea , still estonians speak very fast , but i like the language a lot . 
  well to add : the phenomena of words eroding is also evident in finnish , like `` helsingiss\u00e4 '' is often `` helsingis '' in spoken finnish . 
  most evident this erosion is perhaps in southwestern finnish dialects like turku dialect , which are the closest to estonian ( and by some account , both were still pretty much the same dialect/language 800 years ago ) . 
  in turku dialect , the genetive also is losing the final - n , becoming similar to the estonian genetive . 
  for example the standard finnish genetive of `` auto '' would be `` auton '' but in turku dialect it 's just `` auto '' ( though the intonation makes the difference to the nominative form ) . 
  and the standard finnish phrase `` turun murre '' would be `` turu murre '' in turku dialect . 
  also , the ( some say hideous ) imperfect verb tense of southwestern finnish dialect , `` puhus '' * spoke * , `` sanos '' * said * , `` kaatus '' , * fell * , does not exist elsewhere in finnish , but it is pretty much identical to the proper imperfect tense in estonian language . 
  like `` m\u00e4 kaaduin '' in standard finnish , `` m\u00e4\u00e4 kaatusin '' in southwestern finnish and `` ma kukkusin '' in estonian . 
  another interesting feature is how the finnish word `` kanssa '' , * with * has evolved into a proper suffix in estonian and you can see this evolution currently happening also in spoken finnish . 
  like in standard finnish one would say `` koiran kanssa '' * with a dog * , in spoken finnish `` koiran kans '' or `` koiran kaa '' but in estonian this has evolved into a comitative case : `` koeraga '' , where the - ga is the remnant of the word `` kanssa '' , * with * . 
  so one can think of the spoken finnish phrase `` koiran kaa '' on it 's way to evolving into a new comitative form , `` koirankaa '' . 
  ha , as someone interested in languages and the relationship between finnish and estonian languages i assumed it 's something like that . 
  the usual pattern demonstrating how estonian is in some respect a `` eroded '' version of finnish . 
  many estonian words in their singular genetive form reveal the older , `` un-eroded '' version of the word , and from time to time they are identical to the finnish nominative form which have not eroded . 
  like in estonian `` linn '' and its genetive form is `` linna '' . 
  in finnish the the same word is `` linna '' and the genetive form is `` linnan '' , demonstrating the original word the estonian word eroded from . 
  so the genetive of `` linn '' is estonian is specifically `` linna '' , not `` linne '' or `` linni '' because the genetive originally was `` linnan '' , like it still is in finnish . 
  this is also why `` tallinn '' is `` tallinna '' in finnish - it 's the older preserved version of the name . 
  ( edit : `` linna '' means * castle * in finnish , so tallinna is `` tal castle '' in finnish . ), 
  and this is why the genetive of `` kali '' is `` kalja '' , in finnish the nominative is `` kalja '' and the genetive `` kaljan '' . 
  but anyway , enough of language nerdiness . 
  i do n't know can it be made from bread , but grocery stores do sell [ this kind of sets ] ( http://fromfinland.fi/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/250x/6680f4741b5251d355c30c5d72726429/l/a/laihianmallas_kotikalja_3x3_650x650_150413.jpg ) that can be used to make `` kotikalja '' , or home beer , a low alcoholic beer ( kids too can drink it and we were offered it at school during christmas celebrations ) . 
  i think that 's one of the cases where `` kalja '' is the proper written finnish word , in `` kotikalja '' . 
  apparently it originally refers more to home beer but is used to refer all beers . 
  kali is apparently the cognate word in estonian . 
  out of curiosity , what is the genetive form of `` kali '' in estonian ? 
  well , if you want food for other stories : a third word for beer in finnish is `` bisse '' . 
  while it sounds rather modern to finnish ear , it 's apparently an old word and might be a finnish form of german `` bischof '' referring to `` bishops wine '' , a wine mix drank by upper class in the past centuries . 
  `` pontikka '' in finnish means moonshine , and apparently the term comes from some french wines called `` potanque '' , `` pontacq '' or `` pontet-canet '' . 
  no , it can also be indo-european or even from the languages that were spoken in europe before indo-european and uralic languages ( like of which basque is a remnant ) . 
  the etymological dictionary for finnish language says it 's probably a loan word . 
  the word just might be such an ancient loan that it has changed to being unrecognizable from its cognates in other languages and/or the meaning has radically changed . 
  for example the etymological cognate of english `` pear '' in the finnish loan is `` peruna '' and it means potato , so the meaning of the same word has changed ( `` p\u00e4\u00e4ryn\u00e4 '' as another cognate means pear ) . 
  `` kalja '' did previously mean weak beer , so i do n't think it 's that . 
  while `` olut '' is the proper word in written finnish , in spoken finnish the most common word is `` kalja '' . 
  the etymological source of `` kalja '' is unknown . 
  according to some linguistic blog , the reason finnish word `` olut '' has a t in the end is because finnish is a conservative language and preserves the final t which has been lost in other languages . 
  just a random trivia . 
  i think dolf was kra in german because dolf is a variation of the name adolf , which would made the comparison with dolf and hitler maybe bit too evident in germany . 
  ah true , but i think the reasoning is that if they want to portray planet earth with europe being reasonably recognizable , they 'd show the planet from an angle that is close to normal map projections showing other areas of the world also * and * is from a perspective bit over the equator to make europe more visible . 
  or maybe i 'm over-analyzing . 
  maybe it truly is just a plain old plate tectonic conspiracy . 
  yea , several countries issue commemorating coins worth more than 2 $ all the time . 
  like [ here ] ( http://www.coin-database.com/series/finland-finnish-historic-provinces-5-euro.html ) are several finnish 5 $ coins for historical provinces . 
  well , africa does lie in the equator . 
  i really doubt this is some conspiracy by plate tectonics . 
  the \u00e4 is familiar as sound to everyone who knows english . 
  \u00c4 is the sound of a in `` cat '' or `` bat '' or `` bad '' , and these would be writen `` c\u00e4t '' , `` b\u00e4t '' and `` b\u00e4\u00e4d '' in finnish . 
  \u00d6 is less common in english , but for example `` bird '' is pronounced sometimes like `` b\u00f6\u00f6d '' from finnish perspective . 
  i 'm not defending it , just offering some context that makes it a bit more reasonable to understand why the decision was made in the first place . 
  after the decision was made , it 's just been a status quo not many people have had interest in in decades . 
  one of our earlier defense ministers did suggest removing the exempt a few years back , but since the issue is about a small minority there 's not that much momentum for the idea of removing it ; most people do n't care . 
  and as long as there 's no momentum for change , the status quo originating from the 60 's remains . 
  someone is mad he can not afford 13 $ organic beers at festivals . 
   is the call to prayer not banned in finland ? 
  not any more than church bells . 
  actually in the finnish politics the ones who have mostly brought up the gender discrimination of the current military are young green-left feminists ( former parliamentarian johanna sumuvuori who specializes in defence issues , `` green women '' and so on ) and the ones mostly opposing gender equal military are conservative older men , often affiliated with the military . 
  the jehovah witness exemption is due to finland sentencing them in to labor camps to do forced labor in the 60 's as a punishment , and some referred them as concentration camps . 
  when they refused to do labor , they were sentenced more , so on average they spent two years in labor camp . 
  the modern exempt for them is like a collective `` sorry how we treated your kind '' and is a direct result of our then-president kekkonen visiting the labor camps and seeing the situation . 
  reason jw 's get such treatment is that in the 60 's in practice they were sentenced to labor camps to do forced labor . 
  the complete exemption for jehovas witness is kind of like a collective `` sorry how we treated your kind '' . 
  yea , those are an option , `` unarmed servicemen 255 or 347 days '' in the upper comment . 
  total objectors refuse those options in addition to refusing the completely non-military civilian service , which is usually some menial easy job in hospitals , libraries and such . 
  basically [ lake ladoga ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/scandinavia-ladoga.jpg ) in the end of gulf of finland has [ a similar history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancylus_lake#/media/file:baltic_history_7500-bc.svg ), 
  in my opinion the said paper suggested a context : the said paper was about finding potential errors in the method of earlier tests , and as said by the researcher `` our test campaign can not confirm or refute the claims of the emdrive * but intends to independently assess possible side-effects in the measurements methods used so far * '' ( emphasis mine ) . 
  so this experiment was a replication of the previous tests with the intention to find out is it a measurement errors by assessing measurement methods . 
  like cant the context be from an engineering viewpoint at first , that there 's this strange observation , what measurement errors and artifacts could cause it and what elements of the test should be studied ? 
  i find this odd :  `` the experiment is quite detailed but no theoretical account for momentum violation is given by him , which will cause peer reviews and technical journal editors to reject his paper should it be submitted to any of the peer-review physics and aerospace journals , '' i do n't understand why an observation of a potentially novel phenomena should immediately have a theoretical explanation . 
  is n't a large part of science replicating experiments and tests to verify an observation is a new phenomena ? 
  like quasars to my understanding were observed way before there was theoretical account on what caused them . 
  the strange orbit of mercury was observed before einsteins relativity explained the unexplained observation . 
  i love that film for it 's satire on us politics . 
  it 's not like that . 
  finland and estonia , though separated by the gulf of finland , are in practice neighboring countries which makes interaction very easy . 
  and both have their roots in the pre-historic baltic finnic culture and have very similar languages . 
  due to these factors the relationship between finland and estonia has always been easy to maintain . 
  so it 's not that finns do n't like latvia and latvians , but estonia is a specially close country finland has in a way a special relationship . 
  not really since politics tend to be more party-oriented . 
  however : [ sauli niinist\u00f6 ] ( http://www4.vaalikone.fi/presidentti2012/files/images/candidates/kokoomus/5_niinisto-sauli.full.jpg ) , our current president from the coalition party is the uncle of the green party leader , member of the parliament and former minister [ ville niinist\u00f6 ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/978/1288636871773.jpg ) . 
  erkki tuomioja , one of our veteran mp 's , and a former long time foreign minister of the social democrats is the son of sakari tuooja , who was a minister and also a temporary prime minister from a now defunct national progressive party in the mid 20th century . 
  the grandfather of erkki from his mother side was the mp sulo wuolijoki from the social democrats some hundred years ago . 
  emma kari , mp from the green party is the daughter in law of a former mp jaakko laakso from the left alliance . 
  so you can not really call these dynasties , as they are somewhat small relations and they even tend to have different parties and views in politics . 
  that sauna looks really gorgeous . 
  drunk finns are just very loud . 
  i have never perceived any macho things in their way of speaking finnish . 
  hmm , i do n't really remember anyone except teenage boys talking in extreme ways . 
  perhaps the normal way of speaking finnish feels extreme to you ? 
  could you give an example what seems extreme macho talk in finnish ?
