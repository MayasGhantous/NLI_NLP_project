  finnish `` peruna '' comes from old swedish word for potato , `` jordp\u00e4ron '' or `` earth pear '' . 
  the original name of helsinki was swedish hellssingeforss . 
  helsingfors came later and yet later the finnish name helsinki . 
  actually nokia is an plurar of `` nois '' , an old word for some small dark mammals . 
  of course in modern finnish `` nokia '' does also is the partitive plural of `` soot '' . 
  i think you mean salty liquorice . 
  it 's liquorice with ammonium chloride so it has a very strong taste those not accustomed to it may not like . 
  the tendency is to simplify the consonant clusters from the beginning and/or add vowels to the end or conserve the original vowels lost in germanic langauges : koulu = school / skola tuoli = stool / stol ranta = strand peruna = pear / p\u00e4ron rauta = red / r\u00f6d kulta = gold / guld hattu = hat haukka = hawk / h\u00f6kar etc. 
  norwegian is too happy . 
  they sound like they are very excited about everything . 
  `` 20 girls were kidnapped and tortured by isis , it 's so wonderful ! '', 
  i do n't think it has any `` scandinavian '' tone in it . 
  scandinavian languages are very `` singysongy '' whereas finnish is not , and to my knowledge even swedish speaking finns have during hundreds of years adopted the finnish `` flatness '' that is noticeably different from swedish spoken in sweden . 
  i think finnish language is quite flexible on how it can sound . 
  for example [ as a moody ballad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0p_u1w89a ) . 
   `` peitt\u00e4\u00e4 '' can be for any length of time with anything , and the word for blanket , `` peitto '' , derives from it . 
  `` peitto '' is actually an older word than just meaning `` blanket '' , and can easily be that `` peitt\u00e4\u00e4 '' comes from `` peitto '' . 
  `` peittoalue '' and the mythical '' [ mets\u00e4npeitto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mets%c3%a4npeitto ) '' for example , so `` peitto '' means cover in general . 
  but still in europe . 
  i do n't understand why the soviet union is ignored on this map . 
  in helsinki i think it 's because of the winds from the sea and also lack of marshes and ponds in the urban area . 
  i just saw some statistics . 
  we have around 40 different mosquito species and all of them prey on humans . 
  because of the wet summer , there has been a lot of ponds and wet marshes and swamps for the mosquitos to breed in . 
  one estimate was that as a result there are 9 kilograms of mosquitos per every finn , and the other estimate was that there would be about 21 000 billion mosquitos in finland around midsummer . 
  mosquito is the national demon of finland . 
  tallinn is less than 100km from helsinki , but the baltic countries are n't even included in this map for some reason . 
  why does the finland magnet have a polar bear ? 
  because caffeine itself is a physically addictive psychoactive drug which is consumed by teenagers in a similar ( social ) manner as other drugs . 
  not everything that affects your brain is psychoactive , for example ssri antidepressants are not psychoactive . 
  and i never claimed that everything which is psychoactive is dangerous , nor i claimed that caffeine is dangerous . 
  read my previous comments again . 
  caffeine is a psychoactive drug . 
   by the very nature of the word excessive , it is harmful to consume an excessive amount of anything . 
  excessive just means more than normal , beyond the usual amount , extreme and such . 
  consumption does not need to be harmful to be excessive , and no comedy sketch can change that . 
  see for example [ this ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/excessive ) , [ this ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excessive ) and [ this ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/excessive ) . 
   why if energy drinks are not a gateway drug of any kind would their consumption pattern ever be the same as that of harmful drugs ? 
  because teenagers are not yet adults . 
  they are often stupid , illogical and extreme and are still learning to act responsibly . 
  if their experience while teenagers is that excessive use of psychoactive drug is socially cool and harmless , they have much less impetus to learn how to use drugs responsibly and in moderation . 
   so like i said , biology prevents them from sleeping while the world makes them wake up with less sleep it 's not like that . 
  biology puts them sleeping * in a different circadian rhytm * . 
  as an example of this difference in principle in adults are insomnia and * [ delayed sleep phase disorded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delayed_sleep_phase_disorder ) * . 
  those with insomnia get less sleep than they should , even when let to sleep completely freely , because they just have difficulties of getting sleep in general . 
  those with delayed sleep phase disorder can sleep as much as they need , and sleep as much as other people if they are let to sleep with their own rhytm . 
  the key words are '' * the world makes them wake up * '' . 
  so it 's not that they can not get sleep , but that they are woken up too early for their natural rhytm . 
   lol are you actually trying to make energy drinks into a `` gateway drug '' ? 
  i 'm not claiming that energy drinks will lead to drug use . 
  i 'm claiming that the consumption pattern of energy drinks ( cool and harmless and excessive use ) , when carried to other drugs , is harmful . 
  but this would give the authorities the authority to intervene . 
  it 's not that teenagers struggle to sleep . 
  they get sleep just fine , but the problem is that our current mainstream sleep rhytm is n't suitable for them . 
  teenagers need a lot more sleep than adult peole and still the schedule for teens is made by adults . 
  so while an adult can manage with an 8 hour sleep , a teenager might easily need 10 hours of sleep . 
  the rhytm is just off from the adult set rhytm , so there 's no `` struggle '' to sleep . 
   i take 5 200 mg caffeine pills per day , and it 's impossible to get any kind of caffeine high . 
  that 's because you 've built up addiction and tolerance . 
  i 'm guessing you take caffeine so that you would feel normal and unless you take your caffeine , you feel shit in some way or another or below your normal capacity . 
  ** edit : ** as you edited this in your message after my reply :  it 's all placebo that these kids experience . 
  caffeine is a known psychoactive drug . 
  the psychoactive effects are not `` placebo '' , and for example wikipedia states in the very beginning : '' * caffeine ( / k\u00e6\u02c8fi\u02d0n , \u02c8k\u00e6fi\u02d0n , \u02c8k\u00e6fi\u02d0\u026an / ) is a central nervous system ( cns ) stimulant of the methylxanthine class of psychoactive drugs . 
  [ 9 ] it is the world 's most widely consumed psychoactive drug * '' . 
  as i said , you do n't feel the high because you have built tolerance via addiction . 
  those who do n't have an addiction or tolerance do get a very buzzing energetic high from higher amounts of caffeine . 
  or as from wikipedia : '' * [ caffeine ] produces increased wakefulness , faster and clearer flow of thought , increased focus , * and better general body coordination . 
  [ 28 ] the amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person , * depending on body size and degree of tolerance . 
   well energy drinks are cool and they are safe . 
  yea , and then they carry that assumption and consumption pattern to alcohol and perhaps other drugs . 
  so it 's about * drug consumption patterns * , and what kind of drug consumption patterns do we allow for underage people to learn as `` cool and completely safe '' . 
   if it is then that might indicate that it 's replacing alcohol consumption , something that is clearly positive . 
  more like there 's indication that young people combine caffeine and alcohol , causing them to drink too much alcohol as the caffeine stimulates them and they do not realize how drunk they are . 
   out right banning them to be bought by anybody under the age of 16 is nothing short of * draconian * . 
  is ` nt that a bit overly dramatic ? 
  banning black people from getting married or removing voting rights from women would be draconian . 
  not letting underage people buy energy drinks is draconian only in some first world problem bubble . 
   those things are literally poison , it 's the responsibility of the government to make sure children do n't kill themselves . 
  why is it not the parents responsibility ? 
  it 's not the responsibility of the state to replace parents . 
   and my grandfather drinks 8 cups of coffee a day , excess exists with everything , your grandfather is an adult and is considered to be able to take full responsibility of himself . 
   it 's not the governments job to regulate what we eat and drink if it 's not inherently dangerous . 
  what i think is dangerous is that underage people learn the consumption pattern of getting `` high '' with drinking excessive amounts of psychoactive drug in social settings . 
  the consumption pattern of energy drinks among teens differs markedly from consumption patterns of coffee and tea , and resembles in many ways how alcohol and other intoxicating drugs are used , and teenagers learn it 's cool and completely safe . 
  as a slight parable : imo one of the main problems with education with illegal drugs ( at least in finland ) is that when speaking of risks , cannabis is lumped into the same group as amphetamine , heroin and other hard drugs . 
  and as cannabis is by far the most common illegal drug , many people learn that hey , it 's relatively harmless . 
  and when they take that consumption pattern and approach they have on cannabis to assumptions of amphetamines or heroin , the result is disastrous . 
  likewise when teenagers take the consumption pattern and approach they have on energy drinks to alcohol or maybe other drugs , the approach can be very disastrous . 
   i also never heard of teens buying liters of energy drinks because they are usually fucking expensive . 
  it 's not uncommon in finland , because discount brands make cheap versions of energy drinks . 
  there 's a nickname for teens who drink these energy drinks , `` es-jonne '' , es being the euro shopper discount brand energy drink . 
  a stereotypical es-jonne with euro shopper energy drinks looks like [ this ] ( http://static.naamapalmu.com/files/qd/big/twfgybik.jpg ) , and i found that photo in less than minute . 
  edit : more examples [ here ] ( http://meemi.info/images/5/5f/es-jonne.png ) , [ here ] ( http://images.uncyc.org/commons/thumb/0/06/euroshopper_defiles_youth.jpg/300px-euroshopper_defiles_youth.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://gooby.naurunappula.com/org/d5/5a/d55ae9416651c677/0/783679.mp4 ) and [ here ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/aojvzbw8gbo/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
   these things are inherently harmful should n't it be the responsibility of the parents , not the state to take care their kids do n't drink and smoke ? 
  ice tea , by googling , has less caffeine than cola generally has , and it 's consumption pattern likewise is n't comparable to energy drinks . 
  and neither are the consumption patterns of starbucks and other sweet coffees . 
  i 've never heard teens going to buy liters of starbucks coffee . 
  as i said it 's a combination of several small factors that make energy drinks problematic . 
  the same consumption patterns do not happen with other caffeine beverages . 
  so it 's not about caffeine as such , it 's about * consumption pattern * of caffeine .
