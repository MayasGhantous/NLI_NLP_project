  yes i do . 
  that 's why i introduced the sexuality neutral pronoun if one wants to keep it private . 
  other than that , sexuality for most straight people is n't a private issue . 
  for example obama is straight and everyone knows it , so we should use the `` straight left handed brown eyed man '' personal pronoun . 
  so logically , let 's ad a sexuality neutral pronoun for the cases where sexuality is unknown or it is desired to be kept secret so we have 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 pronouns totaling 24 pronouns !, 
  so , let 's be logical : firstly , for the sake of logic , we must have separate gender pronouns for men and women ( he & she ) . 
  then , we must have new separate pronouns for straight and gay people ( sry & gy ) . 
  now , man can be straight or gay , woman can be straight or gay . 
  we need to differentiate between straight men and gay men , so we need new pronouns for straight men : * rhy * and for gay men : * ghy * . 
  same goes for women , straight woman : * shy * and gay woman : * shyg * . 
  so it goes with the formula 2 x 2 = 4 pronouns . 
  now let 's take into consideration left and right handed people and brown and blue eyed people . 
  2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 pronouns . 
  this would be far more logical than having just 2 pronouns . 
  so , when you see a person , for example a blue-eyed left handed lesbian woman , you should use a different pronoun ( sahyg ) than if you were to see a blue eyed * right handed * lesbian woman ( sashyg ) !, 
  how logical !, 
  much better than those illogical languages that refer people just as a general neutral pronoun word meaning `` person '' . 
  * se * means `` it '' only in formal written finnish . 
  in spoken finnish `` se '' has always meant he/she also . 
  so no , we do n't talk about people as it , but rather the spoken finnish word for he/she means also `` it '' . 
  `` se '' is just a general word for third person category for `` persons and non-persons '' in spoken finnish . 
  you have to remember that languages are primarily a spoken phenomena . 
  the rules of formal written finnish are an artificial construct based on * the actual spoken language * . 
  formal written finnish has different rules from spoken finnish , and one can not use the rules of written finnish to describe the spoken finnish . 
  they have different rules and the words can mean different things in these varieties . 
   we call everbody ` it ' anyway . 
  this always bugs me . 
  the word you refer to , * se * means `` it '' only in formal written finnish , and it is rarely spoken . 
  spoken finnish has a bit different grammar rules and semantics from formal written finnish and in spoken finnish , `` se '' means he/she/it . 
  so we do not call everybody `` it '' . 
  we call everyone `` he/she '' and the same word can also be used as `` it '' . 
  finnish children 's movie jill & joy ( onneli & anneli , 2014 ) about two girls who are best friends and spend the summer together after finding money . 
  i did n't know anything beforehand about the film , like nothing , only that it 's a children 's movie with two girls . 
  it was a brilliant movie imo . 
  it 's the closest thing i 've seen to a live action studio ghibli movie with it 's innocence , [ look ] ( http://media.finnkino.fi/1012/event_9311/gallery/onneli_ja_anneli_800b.jpg ) and story . 
  sorry , i did n't express myself clearly and just wrote half of my thoughts . 
  what i meant with ironic is that different countries are competing who had the honor and glory of attacking and burning a city . 
  like 1000 years from now different countries would try to take the honorable and glorious credit for the bombing of dresden . 
  i should visit latvia . 
  it 's so close and apparently it 's cheap to travel there from finland . 
  haha , this is ironic . 
  i have an 80 year old finnish * encyclopedia which says that the culprits were karelians , as the eric chronicles ( written 200 years after the attack ) identifies the culprits as karelians . 
  this has been doubted , as during the time of writing , early 14th century , sweden was conquering karelia and they might have put the blame of the attack to karelians for political reasons and karelians lived much further from sigtuna than estonians or balts . 
  it 's like everyone wants to say `` we burnt the swedish city ! '', 
  `` no , * we * burnt it ! '', 
  edit : * added finnish, 
  iirc , not in denmark . 
  well , yea . 
  poland has shit tons of [ old castles ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=palace+poland&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=76bjvzf6iswvsgg_5ycycw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=939#tbm=isch&amp;q=castle+poland ) , [ palaces ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=palace+poland&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=76bjvzf6iswvsgg_5ycycw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=939# ) , [ churches ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=palace+poland&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=76bjvzf6iswvsgg_5ycycw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=939#tbm=isch&amp;q=cathedral+poland ) and so on . 
  even as a joke it 's just a lame joke to seemingly contradict someone with an example we all know exists in every country . 
  you are wrong . 
  eurovision is a competition where people argue `` but this is not the * real * purpose of eurovision ! '', 
  and obviously it is n't about talent . 
  otherwise there would not be shows and we would just hear the songs without any context , without knowing what country they come from or who the performers are . 
  and politics have always been a part of eurovision . 
  this post needs to be higher , but unfortunately one can give only one upvote . 
  and to add , since the lisbon treaty , the eu treaties have said that the commission has to be formed taking into account the results of parliament elections . 
  this in practice meant that the parliament nominated the president of the commission , and said they will vote for him . 
  so the president of the eu commission ( juncker ) was de facto nominated by the eu parliament , even though formally the nomination came from european council . 
  it 's gibberish with a scandinavian dialect . 
  well , wikipedia says `` p\u00f5hjamaa '' = = `` nordic '' . 
  in finnish the word for nordic country , `` pohjoismaa '' literally means just `` northern country '' . 
  and it excludes estonia . 
  so p\u00f5hjamaa = nordic country . 
  like eesti = estonia and suomi = finland . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg ), 
  to me promising estonia will be a new nordic country to me is promising estonia to become a nordic country . 
  otherwise he would not even referred to nordic countries . 
  i 'm only talking about the language , not the people or the countries as whole !, 
  probably i can not say it , because that would require me to mutilate my throat or something , like sticking barbed wire to my throat . 
  i pity you . 
  a * beautiful * random collection of vowels instead of * jyrghygrf g\u00e4ns grk\u00e4l gr\u00e5thgene\u00e5r hygrfaer h\u00f6gn\u00e5 * . 
  ( incidentally , vomiting is also known as `` speaking norwegian '' in finnish , and we all know danish is referred to `` speaking with a hot potato in your mouth '' . ), 
  well , is n't that the translation of nordic ? 
  like in finnish `` nordic country '' translates to * pohjoismaa * . 
  before wwii , finland was considered a baltic country . 
  and see what happened ? 
  who cares about norse language when you have glorious finnic language ? 
  i think sweden has this certain kind hyperallergy where weakening of the swedish education would be deemed `` nationalist '' or `` far-right '' or stuff . 
  believe it or not , removing mandatory swedish would have an irrational psychological reaction in sweden , causing them to interpret is as `` finland wants to alienate itself from nordic countries '' or something like that . 
  i 'm not saying it 's something well argued , but it would happen . 
  for the foreigners : the three party leaders are stubb , sipil\u00e4 and soini , and sipil\u00e4 said `` whe have a group of three aces/s '' ( in finnish the card ace is known as \u00e4ss\u00e4 or `` s '' ) . 
  personally i 'm skeptical towards nato . 
  i know finland is no longer neutral , but what bugs me in nato is being in a defense alliance with the us . 
  on the other hand , if nato gets into conflict with russia for reasons outside of finnish influence , we become a target . 
  there 's still the difference that there 's like over 250 000 swedish speakers in mainland finland and a bit over 62 000 russian speakers . 
  the difference is also that swedish minority has a very strong history in finland and they have been a part of finnish history for ages , like does sami minority , whereas the russian speaking minority is overwhelmingly modern immigration . 
  so it 's not just about language , but also about national minorities and their place in the history of the country . 
  that 's why i said `` was '' . 
  local curriculums as such are a different thing from a local test in order to find out the what effects of more free language selection could be nation wide . 
  it 's also worth noting that finland does n't really have a constitutional court to decide is a legislative draft against the constitution . 
  rather we have the constitutional committee in the parliament , which reflects the results of national elections . 
  the ( true ) finns are against nato . 
  interestingly both the center party and national coalition supported the constitutional change that the finnish constitution states `` finland is a member of the eu '' . 
  so now days finland leaving the eu would require a constitutional change . 
  they are indigenous people of northern fennoscandinavia . 
  prehistorically they populated northern halves of finland , sweden and norway living nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and herding reindeer , whereas scandinavians and finns lived in southern parts of these lands focusing more on agriculture and trading . 
  during the middle ages , finns and scandinavians ( swedes & norwegians ) moved further north in their respective lands , and sami people retreated to their current area , lapland and kola peninsula . 
  the sami people speak a continuum of languages related to finnish language ( but they are not mutually intelligible ) .
