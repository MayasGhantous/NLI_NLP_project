  for example [ here 's a parody song in sami language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3xfih67ngi ) and [ here 's the original in finnish language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0p_u1w89a ) . 
  sami people are known for their [ colorful national dress ] ( http://gb.fotolibra.com/images/previews/655135-lappland-sami-wedding-guests.jpeg ) . 
  rene zellweger has sami heritage and was from time to time said to have [ the look more common to sami people ] ( http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/10/21/renee-zellweger-2004.jpg?itok=6wii7rcv ) . 
  yes . 
  my acquaintance said this in facebook about our new prime minister from center party : 1 . 
  suggest an agreement that people work 100 hours more per year without pay . 
  expect that the labor unions reject the suggestion . 
  `` do n't blame anyone . '', 
  because of the failed agreement with labor unions , suggest 10 billion need for austerity . 
  name the head of your largest rivaling party ( soini of finns ) as minister of finances and task him to handle the 10 billion austerity . 
  turn the heat on for the popcorns . 
  for foreigners : national coaliton in finnish is `` kokoomus '' and is often shortened as `` kok '' , which is pronounced similarily to `` cock '' . 
  the colloquial name for finns is `` persut '' , coming from their finnish name `` perussuomalaiset '' . 
  persut also could be understood vaguely to mean `` arses '' . 
  center party in finnish is `` keskusta '' , and the end `` kusta '' also happens to be a partitive form of `` piss '' . 
  together they form kokperskusta , which with some twisting could be understood as dick-butt-piss . 
  uh , well , two young representatives of nc , wille rydman , 29 , and susanna koski , 30 , are both conservatives and rydman is the former head of nc youth and koski is the current head of nc youth . 
  so there are young conservatives in the nc party also to the extent they have twice elected one as their head . 
   democrats supported legalisation of cannabis and marijuana is free available in many states . 
  how many parties in finland support pot legalisation ? 
  stance on cannabis is a singular issue and it perhaps can not be really defined only as left leaning . 
  it 's social liberalism and progressive politics , and it can be a part of classical liberalism with right-leaning economics . 
  also to note is that for example finland has historically had much less cannabis use compared to the us . 
  finland was still largely agrarian remote country in far north like 50 years ago when the us already had more youth culture and cannabis use , growing a generation who had more tolerant attitudes towards pot . 
   usa is left leaning on a lot of other issues , for example tolerance towards immigrants ( attitudes towards illegal migrants in the us are more positive than attitudes towards legal migrants in europe ) . 
  well for starters it is much harder to immigrate to the us than to eu . 
  secondly eu = / = finland . 
  finland has a ridiculously low amount of illegal immigrants , because finland just is not their top destination . 
  sami people also vote for them , as the interests of sami people are often similar to the interests of swedish speakers , both being minorities . 
  well , for example wikipedia does define official language as :  * a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country , state , or other jurisdiction . 
  typically a country 's official language refers to the language used within government ( e.g. , courts , parliament , administration ) . 
  * and as swedish fits all those definitions in finland , the status of `` national language '' and it 's application do make it an official language , even though the term `` official language '' as such is not used . 
  in the middle ages , before being urban , the area was just sparsely populated remote agricultural area of kingdom of sweden , named after a swedish province in norrland . 
  but during the power of the hanseatic league , or '' * commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and their market towns that dominated trade along the coast of northern europe * '' as wikipedia puts it , gustaf vasa founded the town to compete with the nearby hanseatic city of reval . 
  but only a short time later , sweden annexed reval , so the importance of this town diminished . 
  however because of naval warfare n ' stuff , the town became somewhat important military town and saw some military action , but still remaining small . 
  the growing threat of imperial russia and its expanding territories caused sweden to construct a naval fortress , `` castle of sweden '' to the islands near the town . 
  this also caused the town to grow in size . 
  the fortress was not enough , and russia conquered the town from sweden along with surrounding swedish territories . 
  this was 1808 . 
  fearing swedish influence and sympathies on newly annexed territory and it 's capital , \u00c5bo , russia decided to move the capital of annexed territory from \u00c5bo to this city , which was also closer to russia . 
  to reflect the imperial power , a grand new center with neoclassical architecture was built to the city . 
  the city started to grow and ended up being the capital of a sovereign country . 
  the name of that city ? 
  albert eins - no wait , i mean helsinki . 
  ( reval became later known as tallinn and \u00c5bo is now better known by its finnish name , turku . 
  `` castle of sweden '' is now known as '' [ suomenlinna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomenlinna ) '' , but is still sveaborg in swedish . ), 
   people knew there was something going on that 's completely different from `` orchestrating and implementing '' a genocide . 
  no , they did n't know . 
  it 's not like the common people knew about the genocide . 
  it 's nonsense to blame the common german people of that time orchestrating and implementing genocide . 
  it was a secret project by the nazi party . 
  imo in general unconditional and pointless hatred towards other people is disgusting and completely unfitting for human beings . 
  think of science news headlines . 
  that but with politics . 
  you 're the disgusting one who said '' * getting squirted with semen on tv * '' . 
  in northern finland sometimes yea . 
  how can you be an immigrant when you have born in the country ? 
   following the same logic , taking out your penis and ejaculating in front of the audience will be a funny bodily function worthy of their admiration . 
  except an ejaculating dick is not comparable to breast oozing milk . 
  the first is solely a sexual thing , whereas breast squirting milk is not sexual , but maternal . 
  babies suck milk out of breasts . 
  babies do not suck semen out of dicks . 
   i had no issues with that video until that guy started squeezing the host 's breasts and milk started pouring all over that place . 
  to me it 's pretty obviously they had agreed beforehand what the woman is going to do and not that it 's a complete surprise that there 's this breast milk episode . 
   the samethink and the indoctrination is mind blowing . 
  it 's impossible to have a differing opinion and share it w/o getting downvoted into oblivion . 
  it 's not indoctrination as no one is preventing you to have your opinions and write them . 
  you are not being punished . 
   sadly , it turns out nothing is up for discussion with the left and lies , insults and strawman 's are the only arguments you 'll ever get . 
  um , was n't that just a straw man ? 
  '' * lies , insults and strawman 's are the only arguments you 'll ever get * '' ? 
  really , * really * ? 
   i wo n't pretend to understand how sex shops are related to what i mentioned neither do i understand how public fellatio machines are related to that video in any way . 
  tv-program and such are not comparable to a public place , as tv-programs and such controlled content and distribution . 
  like , just because someone produces and sells porn films , it does not mean public sex is acceptable . 
   as a matter of fact , social norms are guaranteed by law and i 'm pretty sure it 's the same in your country . 
  only partly . 
  homosexual acts were legalized like 40 years ago , but homosexuality was still decades against social norms , even though there were no laws against it . 
  we have no laws against walking to a stranger on the street to say `` fuck you bitch '' . 
  we have no laws against men using high heels and dresses at work , even though that is largely against social norms . 
  so no , not all social norms are guaranteed by law . 
  tons of social norms exist only in our social behavior and remain unwritten in law . 
  you 're the one who equaled squirting milk to squirting semen . 
  so by * your thinking * , babies drinking milk is comparable to babies drinking semen . 
  it was outlawed in sweden in 2014 . 
  actually in finland there 's a joke about the finnish conservatives who oppose same sex marriage and say '' * what next , people will marry their dogs ? 
  * '' or something . 
  in denmark , norway and sweden , bestiality was outlawed soon after same sex marriage was adopted , so the finnish conservatives who worry about animals and what same sex marriage leads to should support same sex marriage , as it apparently leads to banning bestiality . 
  we are very progressive !, 
  out of all the nordic countries , sex with animal is legal only in finland !, 
   modern culture in a nutshell - . - modern culture ? 
  are you saying [ this ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/ghanaian-mother-breastfeeding-twins-ghana-village-cherembo-group-portrait-her-twin-babies-breast-each-breast-43865671.jpg ) is modern culture ? 
  you do realize that mothers breastfeeding n ' stuff in public is n't modern , but ancient ? 
  modern culture is the culture where maternal things like breastfeeding and milk of women is a taboo . 
  like we grow billions of cows and mechanically pump milk out of them and make kids drink the milk of other species , even [ let kids milk cows ] ( https://youtu.be/31rzt7gi7lc?t=1m55s ) in farms , and we see nothing wrong in it , but when a female of our own species sprays human milk , it is suddenly decadent and a taboo . 
   i bet the people laughing at this also have paintings in their homes , made by an artist who poops on a piece of paper and smears the stuff with his face . 
  people laugh at bodily functions and parts not often seen . 
  people laugh at farts , loud burbs , mooning and so on . 
  heck the oldest ( written ) joke know to mankind , 3900 years old , is a fart joke .
