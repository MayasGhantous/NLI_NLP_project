  this causes some confusion when people mix the different usages in different languages . 
  the greens have been in government with the center party in the government of 2003 - 2007 so it 's not entirely impossible for them to be in the same government . 
   i 'd probably vote for the green party if they ... well , were n't the green party . 
  i do n't like their fundamentalist approach to nuclear power . 
  i just googled about this relating to other discussion in reddit and i was surprised that greens voted [ not to take a more strict stance against nuclear power ] ( http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/a1305834060859 ) , so they voted that the party will not aim for a german-type fast lane nuclear phase out . 
  and the party has had internal discussion about nuclear power with internal initiatives to loosen their stance and green candidates like ilkka h\u00e4nninen , lilja tamminen and otso kivek\u00e4s apparently do n't oppose nuclear power in principle . 
  kivek\u00e4s already is in the helsinki city council so it is possible to progress within the party with more neutral stances . 
  so there is variation within the party on nuclear power . 
  edit : also in the elections of 2007 the greens stated that nuclear power is not that big issue that it will prevent them from taking part in the government . 
  so when the government gave new permits and the greens ( who opposed the permit within the government ) remained in the government , they got a lot of shit for `` abandoning their ideology for the sake of power '' and they were said to be hypocrites for opposing nuclear power and remaining in the government . 
  it 's kind of ironic that almost no one lauded them for not making nuclear power a deciding issue on government participation , which was a historic loosening of their stance and at the same time the main criticism for them is about their `` fundamentalist '' nuclear stance . 
  suddenly cockblocker sounds more valid . 
  as said above , i 'm surprised finnish loaned those terms from ( proto - ) baltic . 
  we have `` pippeli '' and `` pimppi '' as childish diminutive terms for genitals , something parents would say , `` wash your pippeli too ! '', 
  or something like that . 
  finland `` sent '' their 43-year old and successful prime minister jyrki katainen . 
  before this the finnish commissioner was olli rehn , who is a fairly popular politician in finland who has doctoral degree in economics from oxford and he started as a commissioner when he was 42 . 
  so at least finland does not dump their old and unwanted politicians . 
  kalu is not the most common slang word for penis . 
  `` muna '' ( literally egg ) , `` kyrp\u00e4 '' ( no other meaning than penis ) & `` kulli '' ( used to mean any protruding bulb , now only means penis ) are more common imo . 
  edit : i find it hilarious that saying something like `` sit next to me '' in estonian sounds like `` sit on my cock '' in finnish : * istu mun kyrv\u00e4l * . 
  actually almost every finn was evacuated from karelia to other parts of finland before it was annexed , totaling to over 400 000 evacuees . 
  for example my grandmother was karelian but lived the rest of her life in southwestern finland . 
   some people do so bad things that they simply do n't deserve to live anymore . 
  the moment being alive has to be deserved , life ceases to be a human right . 
  i prefer nexylon xi at the fifth galactic quadrant . 
  or a james bond film from the 60 's . 
  sauna does have practical backgrounds . 
  wood and water has always been plentiful , as opposed to central europe , so there has been no lack of firewood or water . 
  the cold climate also makes hot sauna a pleasurable experience . 
  also sauna used to be the best place to wash yourself , as the sweating and steam really clean your skin . 
  in cities , public saunas were n't only a cultural place , but they were public places to wash yourself , if the facilities at home were poor . 
  apparently also women used to give birth in the sauna , as hot water was nearby and saunas are very clean . 
  so they originated from practicalities , but the practicalities gave birth to culture . 
  it 's kind of like having a meal has a purpose of providing nutriments , but having a fancy tasty meal in a restaurant is culturally tuned experience from that . 
  having a shower does have a purpose of washing yourself , but sauna is a culturally tuned experience from washing yourself . 
   is n't it awkward ? 
  not necessarily . 
  as we have accustomed to sauna since young age , finns are often quite used to being naked in sauna with all kinds of people . 
  one common behavior is that when naked , people also sort of put aside their status and hierarchy along with their clothes . 
  you are just naked apes , and for example many would consider it impolite and a breach of ( unwritten ) sauna etiquette if a corporate leader would start talking in a sauna how working class people do n't appreciate their bosses enough . 
  that kind of status-related talk is generally frowned upon in sauna , and i would say it is expected that people aim to talk about things other people do n't really disagree . 
  in a same vein , i would claim it would be deemed impolite by most if in a sauna , a father-in-law starts to discipline the son-in-law how not to treat her daughter . 
  sauna is not a place for discussions like that . 
  there are exceptions however . 
  our former president kekkonen invited soviet diplomats to sauna and utilized their naked vulnerability in diplomatic relationships during the cold war . 
  to my knowledge the song was written as a satire about the finnish love of melancholic sad songs , kind of like [ `` karrelle palanut enkeli '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8yb3ic0ory ) from pasila , so the song has all the cliches and stereotypes in one over-the-top song , and the song is named `` the land of thousand sorrowful songs '' for that reason . 
  but finns ended up loving it anyway . 
  i miss [ iltalypsy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpvpvekm2oc ) more . 
  i think it 's a general stereotype about finns , be it in finland or in sweden . 
  in denmark , when i had a friendly routine encounter with the local police , they really insisted do i carry a knife , because i 'm a finn . 
  i think in finland the morbid stereotype about ourselves is n't a drunk guy with a knife , but a drunk guy with an axe . 
  very probable . 
  iirc finns immigrated to sweden in huge amounts during those decades because the crap employment situation in finland . 
  result being a tens of thousands if not a hundred thousand finns from perhaps desperate backgrounds in sweden , not always integrating so well . 
  in finland our immigrants to sweden and their behavior have been referred to in contemporary immigration discussions also . 
  i think it comes from one region of finland , ostrobothnia , where young men caused trouble like over a hundred year ago with their knives . 
  they were called `` puukkojunkkarit '' and [ here 's a somewhat romanticized ] ( http://www.metropoli.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ha%cc%88rma%cc%88_otsikko.jpg ) film portrayal of them . 
  as a finn , i have never seen one either . 
  [ is this what happens ] ( https://youtu.be/-dppicozoig?t=11s ) when a underground dank meme storage leaks ? 
  i 'm just pointing out that `` right to marry vs. living with crazy people '' is quite arbitrary , and could easily be replaced with `` common use of gender neutral pronoun vs. living with crazy homophobic people '' . 
  that choice is fairly easy for me . 
  finnish has quite many old names for foreign places . 
  it 's not about spending time with career instead of children , but not having so much children in the first place . 
  the point of government funded daycare is that you can work while your kids are in daycare instead of not having kids because you can not organize care for them when you are working , and you can not quit your job . 
  * h\u00e4n * was referring to how finnish and estonian does not have pronouns for males nor females . 
  `` h\u00e4n '' in written finnish is the third person pronoun and it does not refer to any gender , only to a person . 
  that 's why i referred to literallysauron as * h\u00e4n * . 
  i do n't know * h\u00e4nen * sex , so i really should n't refer to literallysauron as `` he '' as it might be incorrect . 
  and writing `` he/she '' seems just silly . 
  pronouns are commonly used in languages to refer to the already named object/subject as a shorthand , instead of always again naming the object/subject . 
  that 's the whole point of pronouns and why they exist in the first place . 
  `` i ate a pizza . 
  * it * was good '' instead of `` i ate a pizza . 
  * the pizza * was good '' . 
  or `` i have something to say to you '' with the reply `` what is * it * ? '', 
  instead of `` what * do you have to say to me * ? '', 
  redundantly naming the subject/object again and again because you lack a proper pronoun for it is somewhat against the natural flow of language . 
  that 's why many people make assumptions with the natural flow . 
  `` i saw my old horrible doctor today '' easily is followed with the assumption `` how was * he * ? '', 
  because using pronouns as shorthand references to the subject/object is natural flow of many languages . 
  the pronoun * he * comes naturally , even though the sex of the doctor would be unknown . 
  as a gay guy whose native language completely lacks gender pronouns , i 'd rather live in sweden than bulgaria , which is filled with homophobic crazy people . 
  yea , it 's not yet seen as neutral . 
  but you can not argue against the concept of a neutral word on the basis that it 's not yet established as a neutral word . 
  i 'm not talking about the debate . 
  i 'm just saying that 1 . 
  imo it 's a handy word and 2 . you can not really argue against a suggestion on the basis that it is not in use yet . 
  those points are independent of whatever debate sweden has . 
   there is a reason why the word is not acceptabel in daily life here in sweden . 
  oh , the `` i do n't like them leftists '' ? 
  but it has been suggested to be used . 
  one can not really argue against a suggestion that the suggestion is not in use yet . 
  one can not really say `` we can not start using this word because it is n't used yet '' . 
  tons of finnish words are invented . 
  we did n't have a word for `` sports '' so we invented it , `` urheilu '' , or * to be brave/mighty without a point * . 
  we did n't have a word for cell ( as in biology ) so we invented it , `` solu '' . 
  we did n't have a word for fever , so we invented it , `` kuume '' . 
  all these words are now established parts of finnish language , and it would have been silly to oppose these words on the ground `` but they are not used '' . 
  is n't that the point of new words , to introduce words for concepts and categories you do n't have words yet ?
