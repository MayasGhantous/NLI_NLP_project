  `` se '' is very easy . 
  in spoken language it 's used about everything `` i ordered a pizza , * it will come within a half an hour * '' in spoken finnish would be * `` se tulee puolessa tunnissa '' * . 
  `` i called her , * she will come within a half an hour * '' in spoken finnish would be * `` se tulee puolessa tunnissa '' * . 
  and `` i called the doctor ( gender unknown ) . 
  * he/she will come within a half an hour * '' in spoken finnish would be * `` se tulee puolessa tunnissa '' *, 
  because as someone who naturally uses gender neutral pronouns in native language , i have noticed the benefits as compared to when writing english . 
  so i do see a point with the word , so i do understand the suggestion to extent i could see myself using it in sweden , so your stance that you refuse to take me seriously either because of some other people you do n't like seems rather extreme and fundamentalist . 
  so you oppose anything they suggest , just because who they are , not on the merits of their suggestion itself ? 
  like it does not even matter if the suggestion itself is good , you just want to shoot down every suggestion they make ? 
  there 's a finnish comedy sketch about your attitude . 
  you look how the people you do n't like think , and you take the opposite stance . 
  that way you do n't have to think yourself , you just disagree with the ones you do n't like . 
  it 's `` externalizing your thinking to idiots '' . 
  gender neutral pronouns do have merits , as finnish has , so there 's nothing wrong to advance the use of them . 
  languages have always seen some artificial control and these things start by not being established . 
  what 's the harm in it ? 
  finnish for example uses the similar pronounced gender neutral `` h\u00e4n '' or more broadly , even living/non-living neutral `` se '' to refer people . 
  you can refer to a trash can and you grandmother with the same pronoun in finnish . 
  you refuse to take finnish language seriously ? 
  i 've heard they were also influenced by neighboring finnish ( which is also a minority language in sweden ) , which has very similarly pronounced `` h\u00e4n '' as a gender neutral pronoun ( as gender pronouns do n't exist in finnish ) . 
  calling people as `` se '' is not grammatically correct * written * finnish , but it is grammatically correct * spoken * finnish . 
  and languages are primarily a spoken phenomena . 
  speech is the primary form of existence of languages , and written languages just reflect the actual language . 
  this is why we consider languages which are no longer spoken to be dead languages . 
  written finnish is a somewhat artificial construct which no one really speaks . 
  it is meant to be a neutral formal language for writing and extremely formal situations . 
  it is not meant to replace the spoken language . 
  when you are describing the grammar of spoken language , you ignore the grammar of written language . 
  you can not say the grammar of spoken language is `` wrong '' because it differs from the written grammar . 
  so , in the actual spoken language , `` se '' means `` he/she/it '' and makes no distinction is the subject a person or a non-person . 
  in spoken language `` se tulee maanantaina '' , without additional information , could be understood as `` he/she/it will arrive on monday '' , so one might be speaking about a person or a mail order . 
  `` se '' as an umbrella term for persons and non-persons has been a part of spoken finnish even before written finnish was created . 
  i 'd note that `` se '' in spoken finnish does not mean only `` it '' . 
  in spoken everyday finnish `` se '' is an umbrella word meaning `` it/he/she '' and it has always been . 
  only in formal written finnish does `` se '' have the sole meaning of `` it '' . 
  many finns do not seem to grasp that spoken finnish has different rules and grammar of its own , separate from written finnish , and many use solely the grammar of written formal finnish to describe how spoken finnish is used . 
  that 's why many finns tend to describe that we refer to people as `` it '' while in truth in spoken language the word `` se '' does not make a distinction are you speaking about he , she or it . 
  that distinction only exist in the somewhat artificial and formal written finnish , and it can not be used to describe spoken finnish , which can be considerably different from written finnish . 
  `` se '' translates to `` it '' only from formal written finnish . 
  in spoken everyday finnish it has always meant `` he/she/it '' . 
  so when translating spoken finnish reference to wife , `` se on tuolla '' the correct translation would be `` she is over there '' , not `` it is over there '' . 
  yea * suomenruotsalainen * literally means `` swede of/in finland '' but since i have swedish speaking relatives , i have lived in substantially swedish speaking areas and know swedish speaking finns and some of my friends are `` just finns '' merely because their swedish speaking parents decided to speak finnish instead of swedish to them as kids , i have habituated to understand the * ruotsalainen * or `` swede '' in * suomenruotsalainen * to mean just language , completely independent of swedish ethnicity . 
  like my swedish speaking cousins are like `` fuck you sweden ! '', 
  when finland loses to sweden in ice hockey . 
  i kind of like that fashion photo shoot for that reason . 
  it really tries and accomplishes portraying the elitist rich fashion cliches about swedish speaking finns . 
  here 's another one : http://hs11.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/560/1305820877095?ts=691, 
  i doubt they will . 
  center party does not have that vocal opposition to the law , even though i think majority of them were against it , so i doubt they make it an issue in cabinet negotiations like christian democrats made . 
  a cabinet of center party , finns and christian democrats ( which in theory could be quite anti-lgbt rights ) would be a minority government , so they need a pro-lgbt rights party in the cabinet . 
  all the other parties already have an official stance to support the same sex marriage . 
  in practice the cabinet negotiations would be kind of reverse of the last cabinet negotiations . 
  coalition party needed a strong majority government , so they needed the christian democrats , and their ultimatum was that the government will not make an initiative for same sex marriage . 
  in the next cabinet negotiations , the other parties can make an ultimatum for the center party that the government will not block the citizen initiative . 
  so there would be no government support to blocking the initiative . 
  in theory , the parliament could still vote to block the initiative , just like the initiative was voted for in the first place . 
  blocking the law would demand a new initiative , and it could not come from the government . 
  so it would need to come from individual member of the parliament or a citizen initiative . 
  initiatives from individual representatives have a very low chance of succeeding . 
  this happened to the same sex marriage initiative made by stubb during our current parliament . 
  it got buried in the parliamentary committees under the government initiatives , and it was never voted in the parliament . 
  citizen initiative would again need 50 000 names in 6 months , which is unlikely . 
  if the issue came into vote , for the parliament to retract the initiative would demand that majority of the given votes are against same sex marriage , which seems unlikely considering the parliament gets more liberal with every elections , and blocking an already approved citizen initiative is quite bad pr on an issue that is not an important issue for the majority of finns . 
  also interestingly , true finns have also started downplaying their attitudes towards immigration , which i see as kind of softening their stances to make it easier to get into the government . 
  `` sjw '' policies are strongly associated with socialist policies if not an important part part of them . 
  the underlying principles in left and socialist policies are the opposition of social hierarchies and support for social equality and solidarity . 
  in economics , this turns into opposition of rule of capitalistic class in the expense of working class , but in other areas , it turns into opposition against the rule of men in the expense of women , against the rule of heterosexuals in the expense of sexual minorities , against the rule of white in the expense of non-whites and so on . 
  at that time , conservatives easily could have dismissed them as `` social justice warriors '' but now , a hundred years later we consider universal suffrage and equality in education and work self evident . 
  [ here 's a better photo ] ( http://hs13.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/1920/1305820877141?ts=264 ) . 
  to expand : in 2011 we had presidential elections . 
  every party has a candidate , and if not one of the candidates gets over 50 % of votes , there will be a second round . 
  in the first round sauli niinist\u00f6 of the coalition party got most votes but under 50 % and the green candidate pekka haavisto , who is openly homosexual and campaigned [ with his partner ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/978/1288510790923.jpg ) got the second most votes . 
  so in the second round the presidential candidates were sauli niinist\u00f6 and pekka haavisto . 
  while niinist\u00f6 won with numbers like 65 % vs. 35 % , i think it was very surprising that in the first round a green openly homosexual candidate with an ecuadorian hairdresser as a partner surpassed the candidates major parties like basic finns , social democrats and the center party . 
  i did n't think finns were that tolerant , but i guess having a female president for 12 years have shifted the attitudes , as when she was elected we had a discussion `` can we have a woman as a president ? '', 
  she ended up being one of the most liked president of history at that point . 
  otherwise i also think the situation is quite good . 
  civil partnership was introduced in 2002 and it has almost the same rights as marriage . 
  internal adoption is allowed , so you can adopt your partners child . 
  single gays are also allowed to adopt . 
  the legislation currently limits the adoption right for couples only to married couples ( meaning unmarried straight couples can not adopt jointly either ) . 
  most of finns support same sex marriage and adoption rights . 
  however in the parliament the government cabinet party christian democrats have effectively barred the government of making initiative for same sex marriage and adoption . 
  so in 2013 a citizen initiative was made , and it got 100 000 signatures in one day , whereas the requirement is 50 000 names in 6 months . 
  conservatives in the parliament tried to block it , but in the end parliament voted to approve the initiative . 
  it will come in force the latest 2017 , as before that the parliament must change all other legislation to get rest of the laws in sync with the new marriage law . 
  like probably in every other country , in smaller rural areas the attitudes are of course more conservative , but in general the attitudes have changed a lot in 15 years . 
  to me it seems that many people who had the attitude '' * why are the gays so political , why ca n't gays just keep things to themselves * '' have shifted more to '' * i do n't really care , it 's none of my business , but i guess there 's no harm in equal rights , whatever * '' . 
  i have no idea about individual houses , but in apartment buildings it 's generally included in the rent / general maintenance charge , so it 's not priced according to use . 
  sometimes it 's can be separate fixed cost , was like 15 $ / month in one otherwise cheap flat i used to live in . 
  it was built by a private obscenely rich merchant for himself . 
  the tsar bought the building to be his palace in finland . 
   not sure emotions it 's not * show * emotions . 
  and `` finland '' originally was the southwestern area of modern finland . 
  now known as `` finland proper '' . 
  sweden/sverige in finnish = ruotsi . 
  comes from roslagen , the area north of stockholm , which is fairly close to finland . 
  roslagen is also speculated to give russia its name , as in germanic settlers from roslagen settled into russia . 
  russia in finnish is `` ven\u00e4j\u00e4 '' . 
  sex slaves ?
