   i agree , especially when i read about vulcanos damn those [ alien immigrants !, 
  ] ( http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/9100000/sarek-spock-and-valeris-vulcans-9153608-700-730.jpg ), 
  with a substantial part of the year looking like [ this ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kainuu/article7552729.ece/alternates/w960/loskakeli+huono+ajokeli+loska+vesisade+lumisade.jpg ) , cars easily blend into surroundings without headlights on . 
  i think eu-wide elections have the problem that english-speaking candidates from a big country like the uk would get much more visibility than say , slovenian candidates . 
  the visible pool to select your candidate from would be oriented on big countries with big parties . 
  zeus would be a good name for the emperor , as zeus was the white bull which seduced phoenician woman europa and crowned her as a princess . 
  and europa would be the name for european empresses . 
  so emperors would be like * zeus iv , son of the titans , emperor of the european union * and empresses would be like * europa xii , daughter of agenor , empress of the european union * . 
  yea , i do n't like all aspects of nationalism . 
  the civic nationalism in the us is what i somewhat like ( but of course it too can get out of hand ) . 
  for example in my native finland we do n't congratulate if someone gets citizenship , we hardly notice it . 
  and we do n't have national values stemming from our constitution , like the us has freedom . 
  finnish nationalism is mainly remembering wwii , language and ethnicity . 
  not a word about constitutional values . 
  renessaince and enlightenment were pretty major changes in culture . 
  western democracy owes hugely to enlightenment . 
  agricultural revolution . 
  industrial revolution . 
  it would also need radical political shift to stop the accumulation of wealth . 
  otherwise the new technical solutions are just utilized to help accumulate wealth and more and more people will be unemployed , as the employees do n't need that much labor anymore , they have the technology . 
  of course there are always some people who just want live on the benefits , but they are a very small minority , at least in finland i 've heard social workers saying so . 
  the vast majority does not enjoy the low income and want to get working . 
  well to be fair , singapore is basically a city . 
  and it did not start `` out of nothing '' . 
  singapore was a major british trading colony , and even still is one of the largest logistic hubs in the world , owing to it 's location [ at the tip of the eurasian continental peninsula ] ( https://greginsd.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/global-shipping-lanes-map.png ) between indian ocean and far east . 
  basically all sea cargo from china , japan , south korea and taiwan to europe go past singapore , as it is the shortest route . 
  singapore has a brilliant location for trade , small size and a history as a british trading colony , so it had great foundations to develop on . 
  well , we are fortunate people actually voted for a system like this . 
  i actually like some parts of nationalism . 
  like the us has a strong strain of [ civic nationalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) which is evident when some migrant gets us citizenship tons of americans congratulate and wish them all the best , and the nationalism is strongly rooted in the constitutional values , not in ethnicity . 
   there is a huge middle class here , and like 5 rich guys . 
  and there also are people below the middle class . 
   you ca n't be one of the 5 , so you 're talking about moving from making $ 45k a year to $ 55k a year and calling that `` social mobility '' social mobility ( or more like economic mobility ) generally refers to your mobility compared to your parents . 
  so if an us dude makes $ 45k/year and a swede makes $ 45k/year , then it is much easier * for the child * of the swede to make $ 55k/year than it is for the child of the us dude to make $ 55k/year . 
  so it is much easier in nordic countries to make more money than your parents did , whereas in the us it is much more harder to make more money than your parents did . 
  sure , a minority of us people do get rich , but generally they are much more likely to stay in the same income level as their parents . 
  compared to the us , in the nordic countries people are more likely to have higher income level than their parents . 
   no , i can agree with you that poor people have it easier to `` move '' up in class pretaining to wealth growth if they are assisted to their destination with other peoples money , but i dont consider that earning ones wealth no one really moves up in class because of living on welfare alone , as the welfare is so small . 
  social mobility is due to tax funded services , which are used for public education and health so that poor people do n't have to go bankrupt because of health issues or can not afford proper education . 
  it means a poor kid has much greater chance to study to become a lawyer or a doctor in sweden/finland than in the us . 
  then he has a salary of the upper middle class . 
  are you saying the kid who studied to be a doctor/lawyer and works as such did not work to earn his wealth ? 
   and i sure one banker got super rich in sweden/finland , there is always one , but not many more . 
  by libertarian logic : they proved it is possible , and if you can not do it , you are just lazy . 
  work harder . 
  the basic difference is that nordic countries tend to see it is more important to help the poorest to get to ( upper ) middle class than to make it easy for ( upper ) middle class to become super rich . 
  you seem to think it is more important to make it easy for ( upper ) middle class to become rich than to help the poorest rise to middle class . 
  i think that for a society as a whole it is more important to make it easier for the lowest income class to gain wealth rather than make it easier for the higher income class to become even wealthier . 
   most people in sweden who work with banking make very poor salaries , compared to hong kong , nyc and london , which is what you should be comparing them too or : you can compare them to the previous generation . 
  in nyc , london or hong kong the people who are well paid bankers much more often are from already rich families , and poor have much less chance to to be bankers . 
  people who live like [ this ] ( https://brandeisear.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/caged-homes-1.jpg ) in hong kong really do n't have a chance to get a middle income banking job . 
  if a dude managed to get hundreds of millions of euros in finland and moves to sweden because of better tax rate , how can you say people can not get rich in sweden/finland ? 
  and you can not ignore the mobility from poor to middle class from wealth growth . 
  it 's completely arbitrary to ignore that . 
  that 's like saying `` all swans are white , and i consider swans to be the white birds of this species '' . 
  so you arbitrarily exclude the observations that are in conflict with your claim and then only look at the observations that support your claim . 
  that 's cherry picking . 
  social mobility does mean that people earn wealth . 
  that 's how it is defined , like that people from poor background can get to upper middle class far easier than in the us for example . 
  the us might not stop people from actually earning wealth , but they help people much less to get to the position where they can earn wealth . 
  and i find it hilarious that you say how sweden stops people from earning wealth , and in the same time finnish bank investor bj\u00f6rn wahlroos , who made his money in finland and now has hundreds of millions of euros , officially moved * to sweden * because the tax rates are much more beneficial in sweden . 
  uh , no one really claimed the money is n't enough for basic needs . 
  i originally brought up finnish `` generous '' social security to point out that while you can survive with it , you can not do this with it :  if however , by needs you mean to say something like having enough money left over for a holiday every few years or to have unlimited access to educational opportunities thrown in with some spare cash to fund whatever hobbies it is you like . 
  one meal per day is n't really much food . 
  not all people think their job is `` shit '' . 
  many people enjoy their jobs . 
  and secondly , many people would like to study a job they like and do it . 
  i have n't read any studies about people who get suddenly rich , but i do remember reading tons of individual cases where lottery winners do continue their jobs , as working brings some coherence in their life and gives them something to do and maintains connections to other people . 
  that sounds pretty much like in finland . 
  like if you partake in some help program they generally pay your public transport and you get additional support for partaking some employment programs to help you get back into workforce . 
  medical care is also taken care of and some basic needs can be paid on extra request . 
  like when i was unemployed i broke my glasses , without which i have a really bad eyesight , so the social service paid me an eye exam and new glasses . 
  yea , but i really doubt people were thinking `` i would have a paid job as in i would work in my own enterprise pay my own salary from my jackpot '' , as that 's just basically living on their jackpot , `` paid job '' only in paper . 
  ah , yea , good points . 
  but my point still is that in order to have a paid job in your own private enterprise , the company needs to have some funds to actually pay your salary . 
  so it 's not just `` i 'd love to set up a company and mess about with things i find interesting . 
  who cares if i make a profit . '', 
  the company has to have funds and you really can not get them just by messing around with things you find interesting . 
  yea , and if it does not profit , there 's no salary . 
   sure , i 'd love to set up a company and mess about with things i find interesting . 
  who cares if i make a profit . 
  that 's not a paid job . 
  that 's your private enterprise . 
  i think people generally understand welfare to be something very modest , not something you can celebrate with . 
  in finland the amount of cash everyone is entitled to if they have no other means of income is some 480 euros . 
  like if your rent is 300/month and electricity is 10/month , you get 300 + 10 + 480 cash to use as you will . 
  this 480 is for food , phone bills , internet , commuting , hobbies , everything . 
  so it 's not really much , and to my understanding , the finnish system is generally seen as `` generous '' . 
  but their banking system is out of control !, 
  here 's an interesting graph how social mobility , ie . 
  the chance of a person from poor background to work his way to a wealthier class of the society is the highest in countries with exessive welfare policies : http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/multimedia/interactives/2013/13_facts_education/2.jpg, 
  sweden , and the nordic countries in general have much more social mobility than for example the us : http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/multimedia/interactives/2013/13_facts_education/2.jpg, 
  except the working people in finland have gotten their job via being parasites , ie getting money for studying . 
  were there no welfare , tons of people could not have afforded to study in the first place . 
  there are tons of studies how your socioeconomic upbringing influences your future . 
  in finland for example the adults whose family was badly hit by the early 90 's depression when they were kids are significantly more likely to be unemployed , have a criminal record , mental health problems and so on . 
  if your background has no influence on your succes , then why are nigerians more poor than finns ? 
   there were marx and engels . 
  they gave 90 % of socialism . 
  it 's not that we should try 10 % .
