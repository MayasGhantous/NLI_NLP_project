  france just does not want the official seat of the parliament to be moved from strasbourg so the parliament is dictated by eu treaties to also be located in strasbourg . 
  it is arbitrary what counts as a `` real check on brussels 's decisions '' . 
  the lobbyists move where ever there is legislative power , so if the other house of the eu would be located only in strasbourg , it would also become a major center for lobbying . 
  it 's also worth noting that there 's not any singular eu entity in brussels that makes decisions . 
  the decisions are shared between the commission , the parliament and the council of ministers , and they have checks on the decisions the others make . 
  if the commission makes a legislative initiative the parliament does not like the parliament will reject it . 
  if the parliament agrees with the initiative by commission but the council of ministers does not like it , the council of ministers will reject it . 
  and if the council of ministers approves an initiative , the parliament does not like , the parliament will reject it . 
  an example on this `` real check on brussels 's decisions '' is how the parliament took a stance to protect net neutrality and to abandon unnecessary costly mobile roaming charges . 
  the council of ministers did not like this , and made a `` real check on brussels 's decision '' and rejected the decision by the parliament and made a new suggestion . 
  the parliament again made a `` real check on brussels 's decision '' and opposes the decision by the council of ministers . 
  it 's also worth noting that the council of ministers is made of national ministers , who mostly reside in their home countries managing their national governments , so the lobbying for the council of ministers mostly has to be done in each individual country . 
  as the parliament is directly elected , has legislative powers and the commission is responsible for the parliament , it perfectly fits the definition of a parliament . 
  the council of ministers is more akin to a senate , with the ministers being `` senators '' of national governments , not being elected by the citizens but rather reflecting the resulting government of national elections . 
  not every democracy has two chambers . 
  finland , sweden , norway , denmark , iceland , estonia , latvia and lithuania are unicameral , having only one chamber . 
  and the eu already has two chambers . 
  the lower house is the parliament , representing the citizens of the eu and the upper house is the council of ministers , representing the national governments of the eu . 
   they should never have given any money to greece and should let it die in the painful death they asked for . 
  i would call this greed , childishness , immaturity , etc. . 
  eu already has that to a large degree : the parliament and the council of ministers form the bicameral legislative branch of the eu . 
   a second parliament chamber would need to be created with different members why just not double the size of current parliament ? 
  there 's also the [ st. 
  basil cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_basil%27s_cathedral ) from moscow and you can see the edge of the eiffel tower too . 
  sweden will rule the world . 
  european identity grows without us even realizing it because of how non-europeans talk about people in europe . 
  like german goes to the us and they ask `` do europeans do this '' or online other people talk about `` europeans '' . 
  the way other people talk does make us also somehow act like we are `` european '' more than just someone living there , even though we might not acknowledge it 's becoming an identity . 
  that can be said about any competition or sport someone does not like . 
  that 's more support than i thought . 
  i liked how some schools in finland have greenhouses where students grow and maintain plants and vegetables also learning biology at the same time , and some of the products are then used in home economics classes to learn how to make food . 
  we were told the white represents snow and clouds in summer sky , and blue is the clear sky and thousands of lakes . 
  in reality the flag has a long evolution 1 . 
  the ultimate source is [ the naval flag of the russian empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_navy_ensign#/media/file:naval_ensign_of_russia.svg ) created in 1712 . 
  the cross comes from the cross of st. andrew , as [ order of st. andrew ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_st._andrew#/media/file:badge_to_order_st_andrew_both_sides.jpg ) was the highest order of chivalry in the russian empire . 
  the cross of st. andrew also happens to be in the [ flag of scotland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_scotland.svg ) . 
  the naval flag of russia was the inspiration for [ the flag of the neva yacht club ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neva_yacht_club#/media/file:nevskyflot1.png ) of st. petersburg founded in 1718 . 
  the neva yacht club is one of the oldest in the world and the flag was apparently designed by the czar himself . 
  the naval flag of russia was the inspiration for the modified [ finnish merchant navy flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/alkuperalippu.svg ) used during the crimean war in the 19th century . 
  it was the first flag used especially by finns . 
  the neva yacht club flag & the finnish merchant flag was the inspiration for the [ flag of nylands yacht club ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nyl%c3%a4ndska_jaktklubben#/media/file:flag_of_nyland_yacht_club.png ) in helsinki . 
  this and the finnish merchant navy flag became the inspiration for all finnish yacht club flags . 
  when finland declared independence , there were tons of suggestions for the finnish flag , but in the end the blue cross flags already widely used by sailors influenced the approved design . 
  [ glorious socialist utopia of sweden ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7a/4c/4b/7a4c4b9d9a127b02f7a7ba5552b30485.jpg ) . 
  sounds like a [ pagan sacrifice ] ( http://images.sodahead.com/polls/000210320/polls_aztecs40_3131_384675_answer_2_xlarge.gif ) . 
  the part about vocational course seemed to refer to either vocational schools which have for decades been the schools which produce workers , or then to optional courses in high school people can choose to their curriculum , and have for some time included non-academic stuff . 
  in vocational schools the courses tend to be separated . 
  for example a vocational degree for catering services has individual course for math , individual course for preparing food , individual courses for languages and so on . 
  the reform would mean the courses for vocational degree on catering services would have `` cafeteria course '' where you deal with how math , preparing food and languages work in respect to cafeteria setting . 
  the article did differentiate those who take vocational courses with '' * more academic pupils would be taught cross-subject topics such as the european union - which would merge elements of economics , history ( of the countries involved ) , languages and geography * '' . 
  the finnish high school is seen as the more academic , preparing students for universities and other higher lever education , whereas vocational schools prepare students directly to work force . 
  i do n't think an infrastructure of this scale which will not exist in 20 years should be ignored because of current situation which is prone to change . 
  the benefit comes from integrating finland better into the `` continental '' eu and preparing even better integration in the future , when fossil fuel prices probably will increase , so the benefits would be starting from 2035 and would increase from that . 
  for example some super-mega-hyper-science-3000-highspeed train in 2090 would be much easier to build when there already is a basic infrastructure which to improve . 
  also the rail connection would greatly improve transport of goods , as instead of cars going with boats or via russia , they could be transported directly to finland via rail . 
  nah , the stockholm metropolitan area is larger with 2,1 million people . 
  copenhagen + malm\u00f6 urban areas are 2,7 million combined . 
  yep . 
  also , with eu attempts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels , the price of flying might also considerably change in the future . 
  sure we can compare the two tunnels , and see what are their similarities an differences , and what those differences imply for the project . 
  channel tunnel is n't used to daily commuting that much . 
  rather the people who want to travel from uk to continental europe tend to fly . 
  no one really flies between helsinki tallinn . 
  rather people use ferries which take two hours . 
  helsinki-tallinn tunnel would instead make daily commuting between to capitals possible . 
  combining two capital cities into a twin city has different implications for the project , as it would integrate the economics of two economic hubs . 
  luxembourg city is a capital and the economic hub of luxembourg , so it 's a fair comparison . 
  and i said that the combined population of helsinki + tallinn is * more * and it 's worth noting that tallinn area , being smaller than helsinki area , still has five times the population luxembourg city has . 
  as for why tunnel instead of plane or ferry , [ see my comment here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zt3h0/a_tunnel_to_link_helsinki_and_tallinn_why_not/cpm3xd9 ) . 
  i do think finland would contribute more , as it solves problems for finland which estonia does not have , giving a direct rail connection to the `` mainland '' where estonia already is . 
  southern finland , where most finns live , is in essence an island from the eu , as the land routes go either through russia or through lapland in the north . 
  estonia does not have this problem . 
  i 'll paste my earlier comment from another thread , where this tunnel was compared to the privately built channel tunnel between the uk and france : the difference with the channel tunnel and helsinki-tallinn as i see it is that the tunnel helsinki-tallinn would be * a direct connection * between two capitals that are way closer than london and some other capital . 
  tallinn and helsinki are on the opposite shores of the same gulf , 80km apart and on clear days you can see the highest buildings of tallinn from helsinki . 
  the combined population of helsinki + tallinn is larger than the capitals brussels + luxembourg city , and the distance is under a half of the distance between brussels & luxembourg . 
  there is already substantial traffic between the cities , the ferry taking two hours from helsinki to tallinn . 
  the channel tunnel is n't like london-paris or london-brussels . 
  the distance between london and any capital on the other side of the channel is much larger than the distance between helsinki and tallinn . 
  the channel tunnel does not combine two capital urban areas into a twin city . 
  a tunnel between helsinki and tallinn would effectively mean that people can live in tallinn and work in helsinki , using the tunnel just to commute , and economic cooperation between the cities would be much greater ( helsinki being the economic hub of finland and tallinn being the economic hub of estonia ) . 
  i would also assume that eu might be interested in this because of energy/climate reasons . 
  they were not an important issue 20 years ago when the channel tunnel was built , but currently the eu might very well plan that public transport in the eu could shift focus more on rails in the future , meaning that one could more easily travel the capitals helsinki - ( tallinn-riga-warsaw ) - berlin with a train instead of flying from helsinki to berlin . 
  it would n't be a car tunnel , but a train tunnel . 
  cars would still go via ferry . 
  i do n't think majority of finns get them mixed up . 
  i do n't know where you got that . 
  also , afghanistan and iraq are no way relevant to foreign policy of finland . 
  like we might ask from us citizens about slovenia and slovakia . 
  should their answers about those foreign countries irrelevant to their foreign policy be the milestone about their foreign policy opinions ? 
  personally i have no strong opinion on nato . 
  i only offered perspective on why many finns do not find the thought of nato appealing . 
  as samw139 wrote :  the reason is that many finns do n't want to be pulled into a war in some far away place everytime the us president want to show how though he is , like in iraq 2001 . 
  finns do n't live in the us and are n't experiencing the war weariness of the us . 
  for many finns the us often seems a military power intervening with the internal affairs of other countries , and the us being a nato country , by association people in the middle east for example see the actions of us as actions of nato and as such , they see nato members as accomplices to us military action . 
  i 'm not saying this is rational thinking , but many finns think that this association with us foreign policy is not good for our foreign policy . 
  a funny fact : balaclava or `` kommandopipo '' in norwegian is `` finlandshette '' or * finland hat * because norway provided them for finland in wwii . 
  i think the difference might be that cyprus joined the eu decades after the split of cyprus happened and was enforced . 
  turkey having authority in northern cyprus by force is still sort of aggression , but it 's not aggression against * de facto * eu territory . 
  yes , things change , and they can change in the future also . 
  9/11 combined with a certain kind of president changed things 14 years ago .
