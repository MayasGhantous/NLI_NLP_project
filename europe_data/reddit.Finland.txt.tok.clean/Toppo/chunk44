  that kind of change can happen in the future also . 
  yep , eu started as an economic zone , and would be reduced just to a loose economic zone with the fraction of what credibility and influence it now has in world politics . 
  yea , technically eu would still exist , but it would lose it 's current power and credibility as an international player and also the credibility it has for member states . 
  so much power has moved from member states to eu institutions already and member states would seriously question their membership if that consolidation of power is rewarded with just `` nah , suck it '' . 
  allowing invasion to eu would in essence be a statement `` the eu has failed '' , as the economic zone which was the foundation of eu was created to prevent war in europe and bring peace in the first place . 
  if the eu would not react militarily , it would be the end of eu . 
  if eu is incapable of defending itself when invaded , it completely loses its credibility in world politics .

  more finnish : [ finlandia hymn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfx4j6al3de ) . 
  while maamme is * de facto * national anthem , many finnish people finlandia hymn should be the national anthem . 
  [ on suuri sun rantas autius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp60g4rowik ) ( great is the desolation of thy shore ) is a traditional song , here arranged as a choral work , performed by a japanese choir .

  hospitals are n't human so they can never have * human * rights . 
  hospitals are * property * . 
  * i think that bilingualism is a cool thing . 
  because the fetus is within the body of the woman , and woman has the right to decide what to do with * her body * . 
  mine too !, 
  i was expecting that one !, 
  also interesting how the video uses * a flat display * to tell what places * really * look like . 
  why would the hospital have the right to plug off the machines ? 
  it 's not like the hospital is a human body which has a right to reject the comatose patient . 
  the comatose patient does not violate anyones bodily autonomy by being in the hospital . 
  i suppose most countries in eu have some sort of health insurances or public health programs which guarantee that no one unable to take care of themselves is left to die because they are poor . 
  letting someone die because of saving money is against doctor ethics , and it 's not the decision of doctors to make . 
   the ncm is an inter-governmental forum , founded in 1971 to promote co-operation between sweden , norway , denmark , iceland as well as greenland , the faroe islands and \u00c5land .

  even if he died of natural causes suddenly , it probably would be portrayed as a political assassination in russian media . 
  hmm , did n't think of that , but true . 
  they do portray hillbillies and rednecks in the us like that too .

  why would we need to grow 2x the forests we had 100 years ago ? 
  it 's not like we are going back in time and logging our forests 100 years in the past . 
  and besides , you seem to be changing your arguments . 
  you just said `` unless you plant 2x the amount of trees that you chop down , you are still a net emitter of carbon '' and i said hey , we do that , and now you basically switched to `` unless you grow 2x the amount of trees you had 100 years ago , you are still a net emitter of carbon '' . 
  it is the norm to plant several trees when you have logged one tree . 
  that 's why our forests keep growing . 
  oh , i did n't know that !, 
  thanks for the info . 
  runkensten sounds it could be some cheap porn frankenstein . 
  in case you have n't heard : nokia does not make cell phones any more . 
  microsoft bought the cell phone operations of nokia . 
  what i 'm aiming at is that the eu could develop a system similar to nato with requirements of some gdp spending on national defense . 
  it he question is `` should the eu develop military '' then i do n't think a valid argument against that as such is `` but eu countries do n't have large armies '' , as if the subject itself can be `` should eu countries have large armies for the interest of eu ? '', 
  and i do n't really see a problem with a national army sitting in barracks doing nothing . 
  it 's not like that once you have an army you * have to * use it . 
  you can just keep it * in case * you have to use it . 
  now , i would assume that the eu is not interested in foreign operations in the same way as the us is , having military bases in several countries and actively taking part in conflicts abroad . 
  rather i assume the eu would be more interested in just defending itself on the borders , much like the us was to my understanding before wwii . 
  that 's why i think the eu does not need to have active personnel as much as the us , because the eu defense as i see it would not be that active outside of it 's border . 
  reserve would of course be needed but i do n't see that either necessarily having to be equal to the us active military personnel . 
  and if we look at [ eu countries with total military personnel per 1000 capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel ) , larger than the us are finland , estonia , greece , portugal , sweden , austria , denmark , lithuania & hungary . 
  out of these finland is the extreme as it does not rely on nato and has a total military personnel of 66,7 per 1000 people compared to us with 7,3 per 1000 people . 
  i think the eu could easily have total military personnel equal to the us 7,3 but instead of being largely active military , it would be largely reserve forces kept in case of need , just like in finland out of the total military personnel the vast majority is reserve and used only during war , like in wwii . 
  how come diverse countries would automatically gridlock an eu army if they do n't gridlock nato ? 
  maybe it 's a nordic circle jerk . 
  so , are you implying nato is not doing well because it consist of a diverse set of independent countries ? 
   the only way it would be solved is a `` united states of europe '' where nations in the eu become states , and the eu becomes a country , but that would also never work . 
  but nato exist without nato countries being an united country . 
  we also have small wank and large wank : pikku-runkku & iso-runkku !, 
  as said , peat is not considered a renewable energy here ( rather a category of it 's own separate from renewables and fossil fuels ) and there are efforts to get rid of it as the peat issue is highly controversial here . 
  neither does the eu consider peat as a renewable source . 
  and on the forests growing . 
  yea , the forests do n't just grow themselves , but they are continuously renewed here when they are cut down , and the rate of replanting cut forests is so big that we have been growing more forest on logged areas than we log forests . 
  finland has been doing this for decades , as we used to had a massive pulp industry on a global scale . 
  peat lands are n't really turned into forests anymore that much , but rather the peat lands used as a peat source are mostly turned back into swamps and wetlands . 
  yes , they are easier to manage , but the amount of bureaucracy dealing with regionality usually is n't a large part of the economy . 
  i do n't think we have russian drinking habits . 
  to my knowledge russians drink a lot of vodka and plenty of it and often in strange situations , whereas finns mostly drink beer , cider and lonkeros during weekend . 
  `` too fixated on saunas '' is an impossibility though !, 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=m%c3%a4rket&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ofyavdgwk4mczaojuokydg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=939#q=m%c3%a4rket&amp;tbs=isz:m&amp;tbm=isch ) what comes up with the name of the island , m\u00e4rket . 
  yea , it 's part of the autonomous \u00c5land islands . 
  maybe i should have put that to the title . 
  well , actually the lighthouse was built when finland was a part of the russian empire , and the border technically was between sweden and russia back then , albeit the russian part being the autonomous grand duchy of finland . 
  how do you know it was finnish and not some other sky channel ? 
  seriously , we only dub programs for kids who cant yet read properly . 
  sparse population means less people to use energy = the excellent landscape of norway is highly sufficient to energy production . 
  if only you could export volcanoes and hot springs to continental europe :(, 
  having a sparsely populated rainy country consisting of mountains dotted with lakes , rivers and glaciers also helps . 
  but it matters where the carbon came from . 
  as a comparison : human related co2 emissions are about 35 gigatons per year . 
  co2 emissions from natural sources are * over 400 gigatons * per year . 
  but the natural co2 do not increase the atmospheric co2 because of the carbon cycle , which also reduces over 400 gigatons of co2 from the atmosphere annually . 
  using wood which is continuously replaced with new forests acts like a carbon cycle with the growing forests absorbing the co2 emitted from burning wood . 
  in finland the power plants remove like 99 % of the aerosols . 
  i 'm not `` bitching '' , i was just answering the presented question `` why not ? '', 
  and here in finland all programs & movies excluding those for little kids are original versions , because people prefer them and think dubbing as a majorly detracting thing .
