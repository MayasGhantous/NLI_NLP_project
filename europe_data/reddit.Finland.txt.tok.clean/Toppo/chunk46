  so , by nature the initiatives of the commission often are against national interests , because by nature the commission looks for the eu as a whole , what serves the eu as a whole . 
  this is reflected in the oath the commissioners make : * i solemnly undertake : [ ... ] to be completely independent in carrying out my responsibilities , in the general interest of the union ; in the performance of my tasks , neither to seek nor to take instructions from any government or from any other institution , body , office or entity * frankly to me it seems that your opinion about the commission is based on populist yellow press and euroskeptics who like to paint everything relating to the eu leadership as corrupt bureaucrats serving the interests of industry and acting as safe guarders of national governments . 
   it 's true some mep , i do n't remember who , included some statement about net neutrality into much broader telecommunication regulation and it was passed . 
  reddit jump to it as a glorious victory , mainly because the situation in the us . 
  well , it was victory on the part of parliament . 
   acta was indeed rejected but only because the outcry , without it i believe it would have been passed . 
  considering that the parliament has over 700 mep 's and acta was rejected with 478 votes and 39 votes supported it , i think it 's obvious there already was strong opposition towards acta . 
  and if the public outcry managed to sway the opinion of the parliament that much , i think it also is impressive how much the public opinion influences the decisions of the parliament . 
  that the commissioners being `` heartless bureaucrats '' is just a continuation of the politics we vote on national and eu elections . 
  not something independent of our voting behavior . 
  well , the lisbon treaty did grant more power to the european parliament , as it gave the parliament the power to reject the budget proposals for the eu and increased the legislative power of parliament mostly to the same level as the council of ministers , so yea , the eu has made changes to be more democratic . 
  but these changes to be more democratic have to be agreed by national governments . 
  the eu itself can not change the structures , as the structures are set in the intergovernmental agreements signed by all member states . 
   i guess the thing that bugs me is if we were to elect a european council of ministers more directly it would be certainly be more varied cabinet than the one appointed by national governments since the dominant national party would n't have the final say , rather it would be the public well , in a sense that would defeat the purpose of the council of ministers representing national governments , and make the council of ministers just another eu parliament , just smaller . 
  national governments would not have any representation in the eu that way . 
  are you mad that a party which deliberately picks someone incapable of being a commissioner to be commissioner , is the leading party in germany ? 
  well , do n't vote for christian democratic union if you do n't want them to be the leading party in the council nominating the commissioners . 
  but the parties stance on the eu does matter . 
  for example the center party is supported by many because the general stance of the party is somewhat skeptical towards the eu . 
  it 's one of those background issues that influence the voting behavior of a large group of voters . 
  and of course voters have the right to be not interested about the eu and not hold it as a deciding factor . 
  the eu is not to blame for that . 
   yes thats how it works in finland but in countries where you do n't have such big multi party coalitions winner takes all when it comes to the council of ministers . 
  and the winner takes it all also in the national government . 
  it 's not something to blame the eu , bu the national government and the people who voted for it . 
   the annoying thing is i would like to vote directly for who controls europe and not the parliament that observes and votes on what they decide , no matter what way it 's framed the eu is less democratic than the nation states it supersedes and that 's a fact . 
  one of the functions of the current structure of the eu is to distribute power , not centralize it . 
  commission is like the government of the eu , and it looks out for the interests of the eu as a whole , trying to coordinate different policies and suggest improvements which would be good for the eu as a whole . 
  but it can not pass laws , it can only make initiatives and execute already passed laws . 
  council of ministers is like the upper house of bicameral legislation branch . 
  it is there to make sure national governments have a say on the laws . 
  council of ministers is there to make sure the eu or eu citizens do not totally fuck up the interests of individual governments . 
  parliament is like the lower house of bicameral legislation branch . 
  it is there to make sure citizens have a say on the laws . 
  parliament is there to make sure the eu or national governments do not totally fuck up the interests of eu citizens . 
  together with the council of ministers they keep the commission in line of the interests of citizens and national governments , as council of ministers & parliament are those who have the power to reject the initiatives of the commission or fire the commission . 
  yes , the eu is less democratic , because the eu is based on inter * governmental * agreements , and is an inter * governmental * cooperation , meaning the member * governments * have a say on it 's structures . 
  one reason for this is because many governments are skeptical of deeper european integration , which means they want to hold on to governmental representation and power on the eu and not give power to eu institutions ( namely the parliament ) independent of national government . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  i do appreciate and try to remember next time !, 
  do you have trust in any directly elected institutions in general ? 
  like do you have any trust in your local ( directly elected ? ), 
  parliament & municipal councils ? 
  also , the parliament * already voted in support of net neutrality * and the initiative for net neutrality came from the commission . 
  likewise the initiative to remove costly mobile roaming charges within the eu came from the commission and the parliament approved it . 
  parliament also voted to reject acta and voted a resolution against sopa . 
  for example our national government signed the acta agreement , but parliament overruled that , saving finland ( and other eu countries ) from acta and the interests of national governments . 
  what i 've been following the eu politics , the parliament does a pretty good job in protecting the interests of the citizens when our national governments screw up . 
  what usually is the dragging anchor in eu institutions is the council of ministers , which actions tell more about the collective will of independent governments than the interests of eu-oriented commission and citizen-oriented parliament . 
  our current prime minister is also swedish speaking , though i do not know has he officially registered as such . 
  yea , so it 's * one institution of the eu * opposing net neutrality . 
  parliament for example supports net neutrality . 
  and the council of ministers is in the eu roughly to safeguard the interests of national governments within the eu , whereas the parliament is there to safeguard the interests of the citizens of the eu . 
  so in essence it 's national governments through eu institution opposing the represented will of european citizens . 
  not `` eu not wanting '' . 
  a similarly misleading title would be if the us congress supports thing a , the president has not made up his mind and the senate opposes thing a , that situation would be presented as `` the united states opposes a '' . 
   you might say that 's just the luck of the draw but people do n't vote for national politicians based on their european politics or ideology so it 's not democratic when them same representatives nominate a european commission that holds all the power in the eu . 
  for example true finns in finland got a lot of votes specifically because of their eurosceptic views . 
   national elections are not fought on eu issues so why should the winning party get to decide what direction the eu takes ? 
  did you not follow the finnish national elections in 2011 ? 
  the euro crisis was one of the main topics of the elections . 
   the ttip debate reflects this perfectly , it was made by an unelected council of ministers and not supported only recently by a majority of the european parliament . 
  the council of minister reflects the national elections . 
  for example the finnish representatives in the council of ministers are ministers of the government of finland , and the government of finland is formed as a result of national parliament elections . 
  at this moment the parties & ministers representing finland in the council of ministers are from the coalition party , social democrats , christian democrats and swedish party , because those parties are in the finnish government as a result of the finnish parliament elections . 
   for that to be democratic you have to assume national governments act in the interest of all their voters , by and large i do n't believe they do anymore . 
  democracy does not mean that every decision by the government/parliament is supported by all of the voters and as such , national governments never act in the interest of all voters . 
  democracy is about compromising different ideologies and politics . 
  if parliaments & governments could only make decision if their decision is supported by every voter , nothing would ever be achieved as there always is some citizen who disagrees . 
  instead , democracies have the government and the opposition , as parties have the right to refuse making compromises and refusing to take part of the government . 
  true finns in finland for example did not want to compromise and decided not to go to the government . 
  that 's their democratic right . 
  i would n't call the european commission a heartless bureaucracy . 
  they are nominated by the european council consisting of every eu head of state/government , and the nomination is either approved or declined by the parliament . 
  the commission somewhat reflects a combination of the results of national elections and eu parliament elections .

  i 'm not completely familiar with the political system in germany , but here in finland it is completely normal that parties make compromises to be in the government . 
  every party in essence is a majority provider for the largest party , but for the other parties to agree to form a government , the largest party has to make some compromises , but also in order for the other parties to be accepted to the government , they have to make compromises with the largest party . 
  then the government has a common governmental policy agreed by all the governmental parties , who each make compromises in some areas to influence on the government policy on other areas . 
  after this the parties work together to implement that government policy . 
  with a system like this it is normal that government parties do n't aim to realize all of the things they have supported outside the government . 
  if none of the parties make compromises , no majority government is formed and the government is unstable . 
  so every party makes compromises . 
  and because smaller parties have less power , smaller parties have to make more compromises to have an effect on the government policy . 
  if the smaller parties are n't willing to make any compromises , they never get to influence the government in any meaningful way . 
  the reason opposition parties have radical suggestions is because they do n't have the responsibility of governing . 
  with the responsibility of governing comes the need to compromise your views . 
  think about a crowd of grumpy angry citizens . 
  they all complain how the government is shit , things are done wrong , the leaders have betrayed the people , and things should be done in different ways . 
  everyone of them have their own views what should be done , and they vocally shout out their opinions and complain about the leaders . 
  they can be so vocal , because they are not the ones leading the country . 
  now , give that crowd the responsibility to form a public policy which the majority of the crowd supports and agrees to implement . 
  if everyone stubbornly holds on to their personal opinions , no policy supported by the majority is formed .
