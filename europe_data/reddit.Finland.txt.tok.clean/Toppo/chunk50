  the parliamentary groups made it clear to the european council that they will not vote for any other for commission presidency than juncker , and referred to the lisbon treaty . 
  it 's very reasonable this will go on in the future . 
  i just wanted to highlight the difference between sawdust and cellulose , as sawdust is a familiar dull texture and brings up negative connotations as something to eat , and is even used as a negative descriptor for some foods , so equating cellulose with sawdust is a bit unfair to foods with cellulose . 
  i mean the toys still are * in * the kinder egg , completely enclosed in the chocolate egg . 
  no , in kinder the toys are inside the chocolate shell . 
  cellulose is not sawdust . 
  cellulose is a carbohydrate which makes up a large part of plant fibers in general . 
  it can be derived from sawdust , but it 's present in most plants . 
  for example cotton is one of the purest form of cellulose in nature but is not sawdust . 
  generally cellulose is a dietary fiber and it 's good to have it in your diet . 
  it was n't actual sawdust but cellulose , and it was in grated cheese . 
  it 's used normally to prevent clumping . 
  cellulose itself is a rather common part of vegetables . 
  it 's carbohydrate as a plant fiber . 
  there 's this rather ingenious thing sold in some developing countries : a iron lump shaped like a fish . 
  the point is that when people cook stews and soups they keep the iron fish in the pot and iron dissolves from it so it helps preventing anemia . 
  edit : it was in cambodia , and it 's shaped like a fish because it 's a good luck symbol there . 
  ha , another idyllic wooden area i 've never heard about . 
  even though i know that 's a thing in finland it 's always surprising to see where in different places in finland still has these old wooden areas . 
  i really like them . 
  like there 's [ kaskinen ] ( http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared/c/c7/kaskinen_street.jpg ) , [ parainen ] ( http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/static.panoramio.com/photos/original/75202061.jpg ) , [ loviisa ] ( https://kotoapoistuja.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/wp_20130711_005.jpg ) , [ reposaari ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/78199267.jpg ) , [ port arthur ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/19579/normal_131-189.jpg ) and so on . 
  as said in another comment , it is rather middle class , except if that would be in the capital region . 
  the capital region is notoriously expensive , but outside larger cities ( as this is ) , that 's fairly normal . 
  ilmatyynyalus = air pillow ship . 
  lentokone is not as direct as you said . 
  `` lento '' is * flight * , not * flying * . 
  but kone has a somewhat wider meaning than machine . 
  it 's like apparatus , appliance , device & machine all in one . 
  it 's like a general word for an artificial thing which does the task by itself . 
  computer for example is `` tietokone '' with `` tieto '' referring to information , data , so literally data-apparatus . 
  `` kodinkone '' is home appliance . 
  so `` lentokone '' = flight [ kone ] is not that different from english airplane . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://213.214.149.122/netcomm/imglib/9/264/kultarantavii.jpg ) the finnish presidential yacht operated by the finnish navy . 
  well , it 's not like finns want to socialize with other people any way . 
  i think he was referring to the fact that * vltava * is one letter short of * valtava * , which means `` huge '' in finnish . 
  why on earth would you need 10km empty radius ? 
   apparently the only missing factor to allow tree growth is water , so if we artificially provide that to kickstart the growth , the tree is able to continue living just fine afterwards . 
  and where do you get that water ? 
  from the local water table ? 
  it makes it even more difficult for the trees to establish themselves and reach the water table ( currently 30 meters underground ) then , as the water table decreases . 
  my point was that the climate itself is a problem if it prevents the kickstarting of growth . 
  you can not kickstart growth if the climate is simply unsuitable for it . 
  as a hyperbole , you can not say `` the climate of alaska is not a problem itself for tropical rainforests ** if ** you can get their growth kickstarted '' . 
  there 's a huge `` if '' there , and the if makes it conditional under for example climatic conditions . 
   if even a single tree can manage it all on its lonesome , then more trees will have an even easier time . 
  no , if that single tree is a remnant of different climate , and it had time to grow it roots 30 meters down to the water table , because the climate there did n't abruptly change . 
  new trees do n't grow 30 meter roots in a moment . 
  i had already forgotten but now you reminded me . 
  perhaps worth noting that russia is called * ven\u00e4j\u00e4 * in finnish and `` russians '' are * ven\u00e4l\u00e4iset * . 
  in estonian it 's * venemaa * , `` vene-land '' and russians in estonian is * venelased * , or `` vene people '' . 
  ( other countries mainly use the name `` russia '' which refers to people who row , and the area they came from , [ roslagen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roslagen ) in the eastern swedish coast . 
  accordingly , `` sweden '' in estonian is * rootsi * and in finnish * ruotsi * . ), 
  it was n't a straw man . 
  a straw man is attacking the claim other makes by presenting a twisted version of it an criticizing it . 
  i did n't claim you claimed anyone was a pedophile . 
  i was arguing that the logical structure of your assertion has rather interesting consequences , if the logical structure of your assertion is used in connotation with other suggestions , like suggestion someone is a pedophile . 
  it was a hyperbole demonstrating how silly the construction of your claim was . 
  you basically said `` we actually do n't know if it 's * not * x '' . 
  you can substitute x with a pedophile or russian puppet . 
  when you substitute x with russian puppet , we get your comment . 
  when we substitute x with a pedophile , we get a ridiculous accusation . 
  both operate on the same logic . 
  other examples : `` oh there 's a comet approaching earth ? 
  we actually do n't know if it 's * not * a spaceship . '', 
  `` oh an old wooden cup was found ? 
  we actually do n't know if it 's * not * the holy grail . '', 
  `` oh bernie sanders has russian heritage ? 
  we actually do n't know if he is * not * a plot of russia to undermine the us . '', 
  basically : making suggestive accusations like that is silly . 
  just because you are suspicious of something , it 's silly to use that kind of rhetoric where the starting point is that your suspicion is true , and the negation of your suspicion is presented as uncertain . 
  a more logical starting point would be that your suspicion unproven , and the positive claim you make is uncertain . 
  secondly , there is nothing suspicious that call to reduce military funding happens at the same time as some conflict . 
  the world is so large , populated by 200 countries and 7 billion people , that it 's bound to happen that during a conflict someone suggests the world funds less to weapons . 
  these suggestions to decrease military funding have happened all the time , even before the conflicts you refer to . 
  because these kinds of calls to reduce military spending happen all the time , some conflicts are bound to happen at the same time . 
  as a hyperbole , we can see that every time russia has been in some major conflict and there has been conflict in the middle east , the social democratic party of finland has been one of the largest parties in finland . 
  is this suspicious ? 
  no , because the social democratic party * has always * been one of the largest parties , so it being one of the largest parties is bound to happen at the same time some conflict . 
  well , i was talking about reforesting the sahara . 
  remnants of more suitable climates are n't a good indication of the desert to sustain future reforestation . 
  it 's normal for sahara to be a desert . 
  the tree you referred had roots going down over 30 meters . 
  something like that is impossible for new trees , as they do n't have water to grow like that . 
  but a tree which has started growing when water level was higher can slowly grow its roots deeper as the water level goes down . 
  we also do n't know you are not a pedophile . 
  does that mean it is reasonable to think or suspect you as one ? 
  so that kind of rhetoric * `` we do n't know god does not exist , so we must consider the possibility he exists '' * is silly . 
  any claim by anyone could be disputed with an unfounded claim * `` we do n't know he 's not part of a conspiracy '' * .

  it is not known where they originated nor what language they spoke . 
  they also could be indigenous to central asia and eastern europe . 
  what insolence !, 
  what outrage !, 
  how can finns not have visa free travel to mongolia !, 
  uh , you 're not seeing the forest for the trees . 
  the point is that * reforestation * decreases co2 because a forest * as a whole * absorbs co2 . 
  no one claimed `` nothing in the forest releases co2 '' . 
  the point was that forest as a whole absorbs co2 and thus reduce atmospheric co2 and thus reforestation is good for the environment . 
  when the issue is reforestation it should be clear that what is meant is the ability of the forest as a whole to absorb co2 . 
  and actually it is not a no-brainer that amount of co2 in the atmosphere helps boost forest growth .
