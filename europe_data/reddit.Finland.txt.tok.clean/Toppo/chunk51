  it is also highly dependent on availability of water and sunlight and the surrounding temperature and the quality of the soil . 
  in greenhouses all these can be tightly controlled , but out in the wild , there is n't certainty on what the effect of increased co2 will have when combined with varyin levels of sunlight , heat , water and soil quality . 
  like the great salt lake or the dead sea . 
  some deserts are more equal than others . 
   a generation of stupid kids is still preferable than having your head sawn off by isis . 
  not necessarily . 
  if a single person or a handful of persons get their head sawn of by isis , i would say that is preferable to having a generation of stupid kids . 
  like we should n't defund schools because `` a generation of stupid kids is still preferable than getting killed by a drunk driver '' . 
  sure it would be nice to get rid of drunk drivers , but they are not the kind of existential threat that merits defunding schools and severely hindering the future of an entire generation , and generations after them . 
  global environmental crisis on the other hand is the kind of existential threat that if there 's not enough money to handle it , it necessitates some funding to be cut from other things . 
  ( as a side note , the rise of isis has also been linked to global warming , due to syria having extreme drought before the civil war , which then pushed people from the countryside to the cities , which increased the pressure on the government . 
  environmental problems are like steroids to existing instabilities and for example the us armed forces holds global warming as one of the main global threats because of the political instability and conflicts it boosts . ), 
  so what ? 
  read again what i wrote above :  rather it 's a deep ecological ngo * with a few scientists . 
  * i never denied that they have a few scientists . 
  but they are not a group of scientists . 
  most of them are not scientists by google results . 
  they are a group of deep ecologists and a few of them are scientists . 
  plants use co2 to absorb carbon into their structure and chemical processes . 
  for example sugars and cellulose have carbon originating from the co2 plants inhale . 
  for example wood is basically carbon-based cellulose , with the formula c6h10o5 . 
  plants exhale oxygen , o2 . 
  plants as a whole release co2 when they decompose in the open air ( or burn ) . 
  for example the [ keeling curve ] ( http://www.ems.psu.edu/~radovic/image4gs.jpg ) , which graphs the increase in atmospheric co2 shows the cycle of summer/winter . 
  most of the vegetation of the world is on the northern hemisphere , so when it 's winter in the north , the decomposing plant matter increases the atmospheric co2 and when it 's summer in the north , the growing plant matter in the north decreases the atmospheric co2 . 
  this causes the graph to have annual cycles depending on is it summer or winter in the northern hemisphere . 
  edit : as a note , the co2 we exhale also has carbon originally absorbed by plants . 
  the food we eat is either plants , and thus has carbon the plants have inhaled from co2 , or we eat animal products , and they too get their carbon ultimately from plant matter they ate . 
  how so ? 
  yes , but he is a single person . 
  i was talking about the group as a whole . 
  on the other hand , it 's not like refusing funding for ecological solutions will actually cause the ecological problems to go away either . 
  we need a lot of money on that too . 
  i 'm not saying we should completely defund the armies , but we do need money to solve ecological problems , and if there 's not enough , we have to take some money from something else , like the armies . 
  i googled the names in the end and they do n't seem to be mostly scientists . 
  rather it 's a deep ecological ngo with a few scientists . 
  sahara was a desert even before global warming . 
  it 's normal for it to be a desert . 
  desertification is strongly dependent on the climate . 
  you can not stop sahara being a desert without significant change in climate , and desertification wo n't be stopped with just planting trees . 
  just reforesting it does not save sahara from being a desert . 
  it 's too hot and dry for forests to thrive there any way . 
  how i understood from the original article is that reforestation of sahara was just a measurement stick , an illustrative example , not as much a real suggestion :  total global spending on armaments is estimated at $ 1500 billion annually ; such spending can be put into perspective by setting it alongside the estimated cost of the afforestation of the entire sahara desert , which would amount to about one-sixth of annual global armaments spending . 
  this example neatly illustrates the extent of the potential needed for action in this matter , should the political will be found . 
  sahara can not really be reforested completely , as the global climate does not allow it . 
  our current `` normal '' climate causes hot deserts all around the world at 30 degrees north and south of the equator . 
  i consider a stable and secure environment for our civilization more important than armies . 
  key point perhaps for someone who is european and knows what those points imply . 
  they ( the iraqi ) instead might understand that skilled & productive society means the governance and government management is skilled and productive . 
  even you had to open up what those things mean by writing the explanation in brackets , because those words themselves do n't explain what they mean . 
  edit : clarification on they . 
  i have the understanding that the disinformation commonly comes indirectly . 
  it 's not that all the disinformation comes from the same guy who arranges you to europe . 
  but the scammers generally spread disinformation online , and then people stumble on that information . 
  think about for example how gluten-free or homeopathy fads have spread . 
  people look for information and stumble on so much disinformation they start believing in it . 
  for those people it 's nonsensical to ask `` what could this site gain from lying to me '' when the site itself is n't directly selling anything , but spreading myths that benefit someone , and many have started believing in . 
  and how many of them even know about reddit ? 
  yes , wes have . 
  for reference the wikipedia article on germany states this :  in the 21st century , germany is a great power and has the world 's fourth-largest economy by nominal gdp , as well as the fifth-largest by ppp . 
  as a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors , it is both the world 's third-largest exporter and importer of goods . 
  germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society . 
  it upholds a social security and universal health care system , environmental protection and a tuition-free university education . 
  those living in iraq who have never visited europe might understand that very differently from europeans . 
  or if they are literate , they do n't know english that good . 
  as the stem word , no does n't mean the same , but some of the inflections are the same . 
  partitive form of street = * katua * , `` i walk along the street '' , * k\u00e4v\u00e4len katua pitkin * . 
  genetive form = * kadun * . 
  `` the name of this street '' * kadun nimi * . 
  regret = * katumus * . 
  `` the regret is strong '' * katumus on suuri * . 
  to regret = * katua * . 
  `` to look '' in spoken finnish = * kattoa * / * kattoo * . 
  imperative form in spoken finnish = * kato * . 
  `` look there '' * kato tonne * . 
  cover , roofing , coverage = * kate * . 
  roof , ceiling = * katto * . 
  to disappear = * kadota * . 
  mikkeli has two official names , mikkeli and st. michel , the other one being the official name in swedish , the second official language of finland . 
  it was named st. michel during the swedish rule and was translated into finnish as mikkeli . 
  many finnish cities have the older name as the official swedish name . 
  like helsinki has the second official swedish name helsingfors , which is the older name the finnish name is derived from . 
  porvoo is derived from the older swedish name borg\u00e5 , literally `` fortress river '' . 
  though \u00fc is a different vowel in estonian . 
  it 's the same as finnish y. 
  in english the same vowel is in the end of `` few '' and `` dew '' . 
  finland has 39 holy lakes . 
  there 's also a lake called `` regret lake '' which according to one old story comes from when tavastians were be baptized by swedes , tavastians regretted this and washed their baptism away in the lake . 
  it 's not a prefix . 
  prefixes are attached to the stem word . 
  like in * ep\u00e4 * pyh\u00e4 , `` unholy '' , ep\u00e4 - is the prefix . 
  pyh\u00e4 birgitta literally means `` holy birgitta '' , not `` saint birgitta '' . 
  finnish does not use the term `` saint '' , but `` holy '' as the title for saints in their name . 
  i 'm not disagreeing you on that . 
  i 'm saying it 's not even close to slavery . 
  the people who pay taxes are free to choose their jobs , free to live where they want , free to change jobs , free to move to another country , or even free to quit their jobs . 
  they are not even close to being enslaved just because they pay taxes and the taxes are used in a shitty manner . 
  i 'm not arguing the use of tax is justified or that the behavior of welfare recipients is justified . 
  i 'm just saying it 's not even close to slavery . 
  that 's a bit far fetched .
