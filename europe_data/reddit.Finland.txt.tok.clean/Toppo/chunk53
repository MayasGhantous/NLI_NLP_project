  and yea , thanks for saying i master english , but due to another discussion here , i only yesterday learned the nuances and meaning of the english word `` verge '' . 
  i learn something new every day . 
  no one is specifically adding it for any gain . 
  it 's making it 's way to europe is * a consequence * of freedom of religion , freedom of opinion combined with the opportunity for people to seek asylum . 
  saying people are `` adding another far-right ideology , namely political islam '' is like saying by allowing men to be born we are `` breeding rapists '' , as men are statistically much more likely to be rapists than women . 
  so no , we do n't really need to bring political islam to eu . 
  but considering freedom of religion , freedom of opinion and that people should not be judged according to their reference group , i find it problematic to prevent muslims in general from seeking asylum because their reference group has a higher indices of unwanted behavior and opinions . 
  in my view , this principle is not far of from treating every male as a potential rapist , and governments taking much more restrictive anti-rape measures against men than women on the grounds that men are much more likely to be rapists . 
  i mean , the statistical difference between men and women on the issue is significant , and * there 's nothing to gain by adding liberties to rapists * . 
  so why not make these statistically based restrictive anti-rape measures against all men ? 
   pretty sure you understand me perfectly , no , i am genuinely unsure what is meant by `` importing '' in the question presented . 
   it 's just that you would have me focus on neo-nazis rather than the subject at hand . 
  there 's a word for that . 
  uh , no . 
  at no point did i attempts to discredit your position by asserting your failure to act consistently in accordance with your position when it comes to neo-nazis , without directly refuting or disproving your initial argument . 
  i merely was wondering what is meant with `` importing '' when it comes to this subject , and i do n't really understand what is meant with the question of `` importing more of the same attitudes '' so it 's very hard to answer a question i do n't fully understand . 
  you are attacking me for an argument or claim i never made . 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's a word for that too . 
  no , i am asking the person to clarify what he means so i can properly answer his question . 
  i am not answering questions if i am unsure what i am being asked . 
  the un declaration of human rights article 2 says this : * `` everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status . 
  * '' article 10 says this : * `` everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal , in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him . 
  * '' then to consider a person as guilty of war crimes , crimes against humanity or as a danger to public security * because of their ethnicity or religion * , without a public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal , and then refuse muslim refugees on the ground `` they are terrorists '' is problematic in light of human rights . 
   you ca n't fight intolerance with tolerance . 
  he did ' t talk about that . 
  he just said that regardless that if other people violate human rights , that does not curtail their human rights . 
  for example even though someone murders someone other , it does not curtail their human right to live , and for example this is the reason capital punishment is forbidden in eu . 
  abolishing capital punishment is n't `` fighting intolerance with tolerance '' , but recognizing that even though someone violates human rights , they are still human beings , and as such , merit human rights . 
   when it 's you vs. them , it is absolutely in your power and in fact your obligation to make that call . 
  and what are the actual criteria that define the situation as `` you vs. them '' ? 
  how do these criteria fit to other social issues , for example men vs. women , rich vs. poor , right vs. left ? 
   you must stop putting other cultures ahead of your own . 
  he 's not putting other cultures ahead his own . 
  he 's treating people equally * regardless of their culture * . 
   it 's a noble thought , and would work if all cultures were equal , but they are not . 
  cultures are not subject to discrimination . 
  people are . 
  cultures do n't experience anything . 
  people experience . 
  saying `` cultures are not equal '' does not have any sensible meaning , unless it is taken to mean that * people of different cultures are not equal * , i.e. 
  people of some cultures have less human rights than people from some other cultures . 
   the reason the current solution is the only one discussed is because it 's what the extreme left wants in order to signal high status . 
  what is this `` extreme left '' ? 
  could you give examples on the ruling parties and leaders of eu which are extreme left ? 
  i do n't know what you refer to with `` importing more of the same attitudes '' . 
  importing is normally used to refer to buying foreign goods to your own country , but i have n't seen anyone referring to average muslim attitudes as importable goods , nor are people importable goods , so i 'm unsure what you mean with your rhetoric . 
  when this subreddit is r/europe , and the issue is violence against lgbt minoritios , one would think people can assume the context here . 
   as a leftist/green is perhaps what you mean . 
  being leftist/green does not give you the kind experience of being subject to abuse , discrimination and violence in the way being gay does . 
  i 'm talking about how i 'm worried some people shed crocodile tears about abuse and discrimination experienced by lgbt minorities , i.e. 
  the experience and position i have had my share of , and use their pretend worry as an excuse to abuse and discriminate other people . 
   not all gays are as naive as you what regards to mass immigration from muslim countries . 
  naive as me ? 
  * i did not even voice my opinion * about the immigration as a whole . 
  yet you label me naive * because i 'm worried about bigotry * . 
   maybe instead of arguing with a straw man you cooked up yourself ( `` the righ winger '' ) you could at least once be worried about the security threat that mass immigration from the middle east will mean to gay people . 
  firstly , i did not even use the term `` the right winger '' . 
  you made up that quote yourself and then * you * dare to accuse me of cooking up a straw man . 
  secondly , what makes you think i have not at least once been worried about the consequences of mass immigration , and what it means to women , lgbt minorities and such ? 
  do you have some mind reading machine which allows you to probe the entire mind of someone on the internet based on their one message on reddit ? 
  i sure could use that kind of machine !, 
  or , is it possible that you are again cooking up a straw man yourself , and blaming me of not worrying at all about the mass immigration , even though you do n't even know what i think of the subject ? 
   violence against gays is on the rise in europe and it is almost completely because of muslims . 
  yes , the increasing bigotry and violence against gays from homophobic muslims is an issue . 
  what i am * also * worried about is that people then use this as an excuse for bigotry and violence * targeting * muslims , in essence doing what they themselves claim to be worried about . 
  shedding crocodile tears due to lgbt minorities being subject of bigotry and violence , only to make their own bigotry and violence morally justified , even when these people in other situations are themselves bigoted against lgbt minorities . 
  as a gay guy , i feel very worried that people will be using protection of our rights as a stick horse excuse their own bigotry against migrants . 
  a few years ago in finland , there was an attack on pride march with tear gas and pepper spray . 
  a finnish anti-migration forum started immediately speculating how it must be muslims , how they are intolerant and bigoted towards gays and stuff and some were ironically saying `` thank you once again '' about the finnish asylum policy . 
  when it was said the attackers were `` finnish '' some still speculated that it does n't rule out muslims . 
  when it was revealed that the attackers were finnish neo-nazis the tone changed for good . 
  gone was the worry about abuse towards lgbt minorities , instead people were blaming lgbt minorities for being provocative , dismissing lgbt activism and pride and started downplaying the neo-nazi attack as just a harmless trick and so on . 
  i felt rather appalled those people shed crocodile tears in my behalf , but when it was revealed the attackers were ideologically close to them , these people then started questioning the very things that have been and still are important for my rights . 
  so , i 'm worried some people will use the treatment of these gay migrants as a morally pure mask to hide their bigotry , that the experiences of victims of bigotry are exploited as fuel for bigotry . 
   it 's interesting because even though `` allness '' is n't really a word , its meaning still comes through in the metaphysical/poetic way you describe . 
  it 's because the lucky chance that english does have some suffixes with roughly same meaning as some finnish suffixes . 
  for example * tyhj\u00e4 * `` empty '' -  * tyhjyys * , `` emptiness '' and these are the most proper translations , and in both languages the same change is meaning is conveyed with a suffix . 
  but the difference in finnish is that suffixes are utilized much more , and new words which readily are grammatically correct but novel can easily be derived with suffixes , just like `` vergeless '' . 
  a favorite of mine : * ajaa * `` to drive '' -  * ajattaa * , `` to make someone or something drive '' -  * ajatella * is `` to make someone or something drive around sporadically , without an aim '' , and actually the word * ajatella * means `` to think '' , and metaphorically refers to how you drive after / chase your thoughts around your head . 
   yup , finnish is definitely an outlier of languages . 
  i have no idea how you are able to pick up english so ( seemingly ) well . 
  it must be challenging . 
  that , or you 're incredibly smart people with excellent educators . 
  well , as english language culture is so globally spread , i spoke some english even before i started studying it at age 10 . 
  excluding tv shows for the smallest kids , all programs are subtitled , and as most programs are in english , when i learned to read finnish at age 5 or 6 , i also started understanding the content of english tv programs , and i suspect this `` read finnish , hear english '' bath greatly influence the english capacities . 
  we learn it already when we are young and malleable , so it 's not really comparable to an adult starting to study a completely foreign language , like english speaking starting to learn finnish . 
  also in other nordic countries programs are n't really dubbed , so kids hear english and read the translation from a young age . 
  in addition to tv , video games were a natural use of english . 
  when internet started becoming more popular , english has been the primary language i use online . 
  for example when i read wikipedia , i just read the english one directly . 
  so it was n't really challenging in any point for me , because i used english so much from a young age . 
   limitless is a common word , but vergeless is harder to skip over . 
  kinda stops you in your tracks . 
  i need to borrow that . 
  thanks . 
  limitles in finnish would be * rajaton * . 
  just to my language ear , `` limit '' sounds closer in the meaning to * raja * , in most cases . 
  for example * rajoitettu malli * , `` limited edition '' or * rajoittamaton sis\u00e4\u00e4np\u00e4\u00e4sy * `` unlimited entrance '' . 
  allness has sort of a buddhist `` make me one with everything '' - vibe . 
  it is sometimes used as a synonym for universe , but it has a certain poetic cosmic echo in it , less the kind of factual scientific `` universe '' tone which * maailmankaikkeus * has ( but it 's not stopping one from using it in science ) .
