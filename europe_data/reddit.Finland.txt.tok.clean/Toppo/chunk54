  for example an improvised teen angst phrase * kaikkeuden keskell\u00e4 kyynelehdin * `` in the midst of allness i weep '' has perhaps a more spiritual , poetic tone than * maailmankaikkeuden keskell\u00e4 kyynelehdin * , `` in the midst of the universe i weep '' . 
  universality seems to have many definitions . 
  i would say that one translation would be * yleisp\u00e4tevyys * , from * yleinen * , * yleis - * `` general '' , `` generic '' , `` pan - '' and * p\u00e4tevyys * is somewhat like `` competence '' . 
  so this translation for universality in finnish literally is like * pancompetence * , and has a kind of pragmatic tone . 
  like `` the pancompetence/universality of this code is astonishing '' . 
  finnish does have the word * universaalius * which is a direct loan from `` universal '' , * universaali * with the finnish suffix - * us * , comparable to english '' - ity '' suffix added . 
  it too has a more pragmatic tone in finnish , less related to things like transcendental features of cosmos , but more like `` universality of smile is recognized everywhere '' . 
  there 's no single word for ubiquity in finnish , the translation for that would be * kaikkialla l\u00e4sn\u00e4 * , `` present everywhere '' or * kaikkialla oleva * , `` being everywhere '' . 
  infinite in finnish is * \u00e4\u00e4ret\u00f6n * . 
  * \u00c4\u00e4ri * means far reach , limit in an abstract way , verge . 
  for example in finnish one can say * olen \u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4ni my\u00f6ten t\u00e4ynn\u00e4 paskaasi * , `` i 'm filled to my brims with your shit '' . 
  * \u00c4\u00e4rioikeisto * means `` far right '' . 
  the suffix * - t\u00f6n * means without . 
  so one literal translation for * \u00e4\u00e4ret\u00f6n * could be `` vergeless '' . 
  a small note : the english word `` slave '' comes from the ethnonym * slav * , as slavic people at some point were commonly sold as slaved . 
  in finnish on the other hand the word for slave is * orja * , which comes from indo-european word * aryan * , which also happens to be the origin of words * iran * and * iranian * . 
  interesting , it 's coldness of darkness , shade ? 
  what a nicely specific kind of cold . 
  then there 's the short film [ `` battle field '' ] ( https://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjc8q2ph47lahxcipokhakwdn0qtwiigjaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dfjvry04r8io&amp;usg=afqjcnee1xv0harvt9n9me26kavfzj21jg&amp;sig2=gpquzo3hejqzv5aklopr3q&amp;bvm=bv.114733917,d.bgs ) ( in finnish ) by finnish defense forces made in the 90 's for education purposes which follows a conflict escalating in europe in a fairly realistic manner . 
  airspace breaches in europe are increasing , nato starts keeping extra trainings , finland and sweden start closer defense cooperation , finland starts planning mandatory visa from foreigners , eu demands finland to increase military support for estonia , the parliament decides to restrict use of private cars . 
  then a finnish fighter plane is shot down in front of finland , eu leaders gather to an emergency session , commercial media in finland is taken into state control and evacuation of helsinki starts before invading forces arrive . 
  even though obviously low budget , it has a nice no-frills mockumentary feel . 
  they even used real news broadcasters and the [ have pyrotechnics and gore !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fjvry04r8io?t=8m48s ), 
  well , this is the internet , filled with ignorant people , so what do you expect . 
  why assume someone is acting ignorant on the internet for the sake of humor when you can just assume someone on the internet is ignorant . 
  it 's a simpler and more straightforward assumption from the same set of observations . 
  * v\u00e4lke * in finnish in glittering and glimmering , like twinkling reflection . 
  the twinkling of lamps for example is vilkkua , but twinkling reflections of a diamond is v\u00e4lkky\u00e4 . 
  * v\u00e4lkky * is a somewhat sarcastic adjective `` bright '' of a person , kind of like no shit , sherlock . 
  one lightning in finnnish would be * salama * , which also is used for flash in photography . 
  actually ulkomaalainen does not really translate to `` outside of * this world * '' . 
  * maa * in lower case translates to land , country , earth , ground , soil , not to world or earth as the planet . 
  world is * maailma * . 
  so in * ulkomaalainen * there is n't the word `` world '' . 
  also * ulkomaalainen * does not have any demonstrative pronouns like `` this '' . 
  `` this world '' would be * t\u00e4m\u00e4 maailma * . 
  * maalainen * as such normally translates to someone from the countryside . 
  it 's never really understood as an autonym for people of the earth , `` earthling '' any more that it is understood as someone from the ground , `` groundling '' or soil , `` soiling '' . 
  * ulkomaalainen * then again comes from the compound word * ulkomaa * , which literally would mean external land , country , countryside , earth , ground , soil , but actually means `` foreign country '' . 
  ulkomaalainen makes the word adjective , `` someone / - thing from external land , country , countryside , earth , ground , soil '' , but actually means `` foreigner '' . 
  when referring to the world with the planet name earth , it 's written with capital and is * maa * in finnish . 
  so * maan ulkopuolinen * with a lower case would mean someone outside land , earth ground , soil , not someone outside the earth . 
  the language * in english * is called finnish . 
  the language * in finnish * is called suomi ( with a lower case letter ) . 
  comparable : the english language is n't `` english '' in finnish language , but `` englanti '' . 
  it works even better when shown after [ us recruitment video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwqt8rljt_8 ) . 
  it 's the same in finland . 
  i noted this in [ another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/46y32n/liberal_youths_legalize_incest_and_necrophilia/d08q8ka ) . 
  they are n't to make pragmatic suggestions , but raise discussion about the limits of ideological principles which guide the pragmatic legislation . 
  i think `` vilus '' comes from being in the cold , as shadows are cold . 
  is n't vilu cool/cold in estonian ? 
  in finnish vilu is the sensation of coldness , and viile\u00e4 is cool . 
  well , actually if the word vil\u00e1g comes from proto-finno-ugric * walke * meaning `` light '' , finnish has words like * valkea * , light , fair ( color ) , * valo * , light ( the illuminating phenomena ) , * vilkkua * , twinkle , which have some resemblance to the word vil\u00e1g . 
  and the finnish word for universe is `` maailmankaikkeus '' , literally * allness of earth-air * , from `` kaikki '' * all * -  `` kaikkeus '' * allness * . 
   as a ukrainian , l do n't like this and think music contests should be about music . 
  as i 've said before and i 'll say again : eurovision is the competition where people argue about the purpose of eurovision . 
  eurovision has never really been just about music . 
  it has always had great emphasis on the performance on stage ( hence it being one of the oldest tv programs , turning 60 this year ) and the inherent part of eurovision is the circlejerk voting where countries vote their neighbors and then people are mad when their neighboring countries failed to give points to them . 
  i find it questionable that you edited out your sentence saying something on the line * `` necrophilia is a muslim thing apparently '' * from your comment , after u/pandinus _ imperator replied to your claim . 
  what are your sources for such claims ? 
  i think that as a youth organization they are more stirring the pot , raising discussion about the limits and principles of sexual morality . 
  necrophilia and voluntary incest afaik are very rare compared to even homosexuality , and changes they suggested would have minimal effect on the lives of people . 
  but they are more interested in the principles of legislation than is their suggestion really needed . 
  in light of this as a discussion on sexual morality , let 's go on :  incest can cause children between close relatives and those children have a high chance of having serious medical conditions . 
  so do [ children of older mothers ] ( http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0815/afp20000815p825-f1.gif ) , parents who know they carry genetic illnesses and such . 
  yet there is no legislation against the reproductive rights of these people . 
   necrophilia is sex with a dead person , who can not give agreement to have sex . 
  but if agreement is given before death , the result would be no different for the body if they would donate their body to science , which already is legal . 
   if migrants knew they risked having their skulls smashed by every rando they walked past on the street , there would n't be any problems with them . 
  instead we 'd had problems with vigilantes smashing skulls of people they think could be migrants , including me , who 's just a finn with dark hair and a beard . 
   of course , the mighty and landlocked military superpowers of finland , austria , ireland and sweden !, 
  out of those , only austria is landlocked . 
  learn your geography . 
   finland also cooperates with many nato activities . 
  so does russia . 
  both finland and russia cooperate with nato in partnership for peace program . 
   it 's as much an informal member of nato as norway is an informal member of the eu . 
  norway is not an informal member of the eu . 
  norway has no representation in council of ministers , european parliament , council of europe nor eu commission and it has no informal ways to have the same influence within eu the formal members do . 
  likewise , finland is not an informal member of nato any more than russia is an informal member due to some cooperation with nato . 
    well , america is doing a shit job protecting ukraine  probably because it 's not part of nato ? 
  which goes on to demonstrate that america is not protecting europe as a whole . 
   and the eu is n't doing much better in solving the conflict right on their doorstep , it 's america once again that needs to take center stage . 
  not this supposed diplomatic superpower that managed to ensure european peace . 
  i 'm talking about eu-internal peace . 
    secondly , the origins of eu are the european coal and steel community  which of course was entirely unrelated to america 's plans to rearm west germany , right ? 
  no , but just demonstrates that the eu in its origins is not that much younger than nato . 
   france simply feared a rearmed ( by america ! ), 
  germany and wanted to keep tabs on its war production . 
  at this point it 's only symbolic , like most of the eu 's `` achievements '' . 
  the european coal and steel community was the idea of french foreign minister . 
  not the us . 
  this is what france suggested :  europe will not be made all at once , or according to a single plan . 
  it will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity . 
  the coming together of the nations of europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of france and germany . 
  any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries . 
   with this aim in view , the french government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited but decisive point . 
   it proposes that franco-german production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common high authority , within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of europe . 
  * the pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of europe , and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war , of which they have been the most constant victims .
