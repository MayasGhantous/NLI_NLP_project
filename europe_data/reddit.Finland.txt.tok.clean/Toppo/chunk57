  rather it is more like a global arena of diplomacy and discussion , where issues at hand are debated . 
  every country wants to be in the un because they want to be a part of the discussions taking place there . 
  not because they believe they get some ultimate power in the un . 
  the fact that every country wants to be in the un does proves it worth . 
  it 's like supply and demand . 
  the worth of seat in un is proved by the high demand : almost every country in the world has wanted a seat . 
  do n't feel un is beneficial to your country ? 
  well exit the un . 
  but the vast majority of countries value membership more than non-membership . 
  well , it 's always easy for the president to be liked , as he does n't really influence the internal politics and is n't responsible for the actions of the government or the parliament . 
  the role of president of finland in internal politics is closer to a constitutional monarch than a politician imo , so it is easy to like them . 
  none of the parent messages of your reply used the term `` old town '' , nor claimed that term is the reason someone expected something else from tallinn , so i do n't really get what was the purpose and context for your comment about the term `` old town '' ? 
  `` old town '' and variations are rather common term to officially or unofficially refer old historic and often rather idyllic parts of cities . 
  for example [ stockholm old town ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3148/2634196044_7255222ddf_o.jpg ) , [ old rauma ] ( http://kivaatekemista.fi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/img_2697.jpg ) , [ edinburgh old town ] ( http://placetotravel.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/edinburgh-best-of-scotland1.jpg ) , [ riga old town ] ( http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2005/05/02/235903/04145.jpg ) , [ vilnius old town ] ( http://www.kempinski.com/assets/vno1-cathedral-square-vilnius/_resampled/setwidth1700-oldtownrooftops.jpg ) , [ visby old town ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7128/7124161477_516e56a9da_b.jpg ) , [ old porvoo ] ( http://www.visitporvoo.fi/easydata/customers/porvoonmatkailu2/files/taustakuvat/jokiranta_talvi1500x1001.jpg ) and so on . 
  also , the title did n't mention old town . 
  well , as it has red bull stickers , i assume it 's sponsored by red bull as a marketing tool , kind of like the red bull jump from weather balloon . 
   the labour unions , branche unions and all the others who pick their leaders . 
  but who decides which of the leaders have enough merit ? 
  or are you saying the leaders of _ all _ unions and organizations make up the parliament , with no selection criteria ? 
  if i make up an union with two people and i 'm the leader , i 'm entitled to a position in the parliament ? 
  where does this kind of parliament get its legitimacy ? 
  in the case there 's not yet a first parliament , nor yet laws for the criteria for that parliament , what 's stopping industries , unions and ngo 's who feel they are left out from the first parliament from establishing a competing parliament which also claims legitimacy to rule the nation on the same ground of merit , which they claim they have more ? 
   seats in parliament are static , meaning it is not possible to have 10 seats go to industry leaders and 2 to labour union leaders and 1 to environmental leaders etc. 
  in the case that the parliament is not yet in existence , how it is decided which organization represents industry and which is instead a genuine ngo ? 
  what 's stopping industry from setting up and funding dozens of ngo 's which nominally are environmental organizations but actually lobby for industry ? 
  in the case that the parliament is not yet in existence , who decides the definitions of different interest groups according to which the seats are shared , who decides which definitions are to be included and which are to be excluded ? 
  should environmental organizations have the same one seat shared with animal rights organizations , or should both environmental organization and animal right organizations both have separate seat in the parliament ? 
  who makes distinctions like this ? 
  and in the case that the parliament is not yet in existence , who decides which environmental organization has the most merit to be the one and single representative of environmental organizations ? 
  maybe he thought having sex with other men is not gay if all of them are straight !, 
   the parliament will consist of the front runners from all segments of society . 
  heads of labour unions , heads of industry/branche unions , heads of environmental organizations , heads of other ngo 's etc. 
  but this does n't explain who decides the criteria for necessary merit , if the parliament is not in existence yet ? 
  who decides which labor unions , which industry representantives , which ngo 's and so on fill the criteria for entering the first parliament ? 
  fyi you might be interested in the [ functional consistuencies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_hong_kong ) of hong kong . 
   same as in a democracy , a constitution . 
  who makes the original constitution ? 
   and that constitution could be formed as such that amendments to it would require popular vote ( referendum ) . 
  okay , so limited democracy when it comes to constitutional amendments ? 
   to ensure accountability to the people there should also be a ` no-confidence ' referendum law . 
  how would these be arranged ? 
  would they be constitutionally set for regular intervals ( like every four years ) or just if some requirements are met ( what requirements ) ? 
  and would the referendum be a vote of no confidence to the entire parliament , just some part of the parliament or just the ministers ? 
  i 'd also note that if the parliament chooses the ministers , this will eventually give rise to government-opposition dynamics in the parliament , as the organizations making up the majority of the parliament decide to cooperate and select the ministers from among their own , leaving the organizations in the opposition without representation among the ministers . 
  in this case , it is also very important who decides how much power these groups have in the parliament ? 
  should an organization with 1 % of the population as members have as much voting power in the parliament as an organization with 35 % of the population as members ? 
  should a global corporation like exxonmobil with a huge revenue have as much voting power in the parliament as some small local bakery ? 
  i do n't see the connection . 
  this comment section has 697 messages ( 698 after this ) . 
  you know where among these messages your answer to my question is . 
  i do n't . 
  are you able to link to your other comments which answers my questions ? 
  ( it is very unreasonable that if i ask you a question , instead of giving me your answer you tell me to look for the answer myself . 
  in a similar way , i could say that * `` yea , i read your other comments , and they have all been proven incorrect . 
  * '' and you ask where , i 'll reply with * `` it 's all in the internet . 
  just google it . 
  '' * now that would be an unfair way to refute your claim . ), 
  why not both ? 
  but if no one has selected a parliament yet ( nor the ministers , as they would be chosen by the parliament ) , who gets to decide the criteria for sufficient merit for the parliament ? 
  who sets the criteria for the * first * parliament ? 
  also , when the parliament is set , and the parliament chooses the ministers , who/what makes sure the parliament & ministers do not evolve into a dictatorship in the fear of losing their power ? 
   everything you described that singapore is nowadays did n't exist 30 years ago i believe . 
  i mean the wealth and development can not straightforwardly attributed to the government , as the geography ( a city state at the bottleneck of global trade ) in the age of globalization is exceptional . 
  as another example , qatar is very wealthy and has a high standard of living and relatively high human development index ( as in above several eu countries ) . 
  like singapore , qatar is a tiny state , and like singapore , it benefits from it 's geography , having vast oil and gas reserves . 
  it would be misleading to say it is a great example of sharia law can achieve when done right as obviously the fossil fuel reserves greatly explain the wealth and standard of living , and tiny size can also greatly contribute to the ease of governing . 
  i would claim that with the size and position of singapore , many other forms of government could also have been easily `` done right '' in singapore . 
  of course we do n't have the opportunity to alternative history for singapore to prove this claim . 
   is n't benevolent dictatorship generally regarded as one of the best forms of governance ? 
  in a way i think benevolent dictatorship as a prescriptive term for a form of government is a bit silly . 
  it could be argued that equally good or better form of government is `` benevolent democracy '' , `` benevolent meritocracy '' or `` benevolent anarchy '' , where those using power use it with benevolence and actively try to avoid the problems associated with said forms of government . 
  if someone says `` benevolent dictatorship is better than democracy '' , it could be refuted with `` well , benevolent democracy is even better than benevolent dictatorship ! '', 
  these do n't really contribute the actual discussion which is better , democracy or dictatorship . 
  who gets to decide the criteria for sufficient merit ? 
  who gets to pick who are in the parliament ? 
   a proportion ( not going to argue how many here ) even look to the east and see rapid development ( at the expense of human rights , democracy ) and wonder where it all went wrong for europe . 
  this is not a fair comparison . 
  the economies like china and india are going through their industrial revolution . 
  europe is a post-industrial developed continent . 
  the countries with rapid development are * developing countries * , not developed countries . 
  their standard of living is significantly lower than in europe . 
  i would n't say singapore is a perfect example . 
  in many ways , the government of singapore is not benevolent . 
  instead of being honestly a dictatorship , the country is nominally a democracy with free elections , which the ruling party always wins . 
  the people there are n't afraid of the government , but greatly support the government , greatly contributing to the victory of the ruling party . 
  but the ruling party sets limits on freedom of speech that public discussion about political alternatives is not that easy . 
  this of course serves the purpose to maintain the power of the ruling party , as it is a dictatorship . 
  it is open to question whether or not it is benevolence to make it harder for people to criticize the government and discuss about the alternatives . 
  and when it comes to the success of singapore , its location on the tip of malaysian peninsula makes the shortest route between china/taiwan/japan / vietnam and india/africa/europe pass right in [ front of singapore ] ( http://www.gscintell.com/assets/images/uploads/a%20evergreen%20asia.jpg?0.3836220803033424 ) in singapore strait , making it a very important navigation route , and singapore has one of the largest harbors in the world . 
  so singapore has a huge sector of global trading . 
  this has made the country very wealthy . 
  and the country is basically a city . 
  wealth from huge trading combined with a diminutive size makes it very easy for the government to raise the standards of living . 
  it 's a city-state , and is n't directly comparable to states spanning large rural areas and different cities and villages and more diversity in economic and social conditions and activities . 
  i would say the dynamics of the country are so exceptional , that it 's not a good example of benevolent dictatorships in general . 
  i do n't think there are * perfect * examples of benevolent dictatorships . 
  singapore can be used as one kind of example . 
  rulers like marcus aurelius , peter the great and catherine the great can perhaps be used as examples too , but i would n't refer them to as perfect either . 
  in finland it is possible to have sex with someone under 16 if there 's `` no significant difference in physical and mental developement '' so two 13 year olds can have sex . 
   just think the name of the empire of austria-hungary .
