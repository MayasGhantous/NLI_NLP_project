  i think the average finn does n't `` just think '' that name , but would need to be reminded of that name . 
  it literally means * nest ball * . 
  finn trying to pronounce baseball would be peispool . 
  i doubt . 
  let 's remember that the largest germanic speaking country with the most germanic people is the us . 
  like swedish and greek is the comparison i 've seen with finnish and hungarian . 
  i think the average finn does n't even know to place hungary on the map , other than it 's somewhere in southeastern europe . 
  well , as said in the article , that sentence was constructed with mutual intelligibility in mind . 
  the words are the kind that do n't tend to be replaced by loan words , as living , fish , water and under are concepts people everywhere have . 
  generally i have seen the comparison that finland and hungarian are as related as swedish and greek , so the link goes thousands of years into the past . 
  that might also be kekripukki , manifestation of the same look on kekri . 
  note that the \u0151 the hungarian dude referred is a different from estonian \u00f5 . 
  compare them next to each other : \u0151\u00f5 . 
  the hungarian one has two slanted dots and it 's a different sound from your o with ~ on top . 
  think of how you would pronounce the finnish words s\u00e4\u00e4-\u00e4\u00e4nitys or kuu-uudistus . 
  estonian just does n't use the hyphen to distinguish the words like finnish does . 
  i originally commented that there are different kind of cruises to correct this claim :  in a cruise you * never * need to have currency , they give to you a magnetic card like a credit card and with that you pay for all the services on the ship , at the end of the vacation you pay the total ammount of your expenses accumulated on the card ( added italics ), 
  but it 's still a cruise . 
   no , * if * it 's a proper all-inclusive cruise like what costa does , the way the slot machines work is always the same . 
  ( added italics ) but if it 's a cruise like 2 days between helsinki and stockholm , they take money . 
  yes it is . 
  what you 're saying is like claiming hummingbird is n't a bird because it 's so small compared to other birds . 
  well , if people take a couple of days off from work to go on a cruise , sure . 
  the fin-swe ships properly are cruiseferries , serving both people who use them as ferries and people who come there just for the cruise . 
  people actually do take a couple day vacations and stuff to cruise from finland to sweden and back and to estonia and back . 
  it wholly depends on the cruise . 
  ferries from finland to estonia and sweden take actual money to the slot machines . 
  also , there 's not specific `` european density '' . 
  density varies [ hugely between countries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4xeek.jpg ) . 
  for example [ this ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/10119/normal_asuinalue.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/12625/normal_asuntoaluemattila.jpg ) are rather general examples of new finnish residential area . 
  remember that not all housing are new `` let 's just build our dream house '' but also older `` we get our living from the harbor and the sea so let 's live close to it '' , combined with limited local terrain . 
  for example mentioned canadian area is located [ here ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/st+john's,+nl,+canada/@47.3633726,-53.213228,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4b0ca38e6b0aa261:0x9e1fd4001f12261f!6m1!1e1 ) where it 's very obvious the space is limited for urban settlement . 
  similarily , even though norway has under 5 million people , they have densely built cities like [ this ] ( https://www.azamaraclubcruises.com/sites/default/files/heros/bergen-norway.jpg ) because sea has been important for urban areas and the terrain limits construction . 
  because people tend to form urban areas naturally . 
  i mean , my native finland has a population of 5,4 million , being one of the most sparsely populated countries in europe , but over a million of finns live in the capital region , while the country is slightly smaller than germany which has a population of 80 million . 
  i mean , if there 's a city near you and acres of empty space around , would you build your house 10 miles from the other houses or close to them to get the benefits of closer connections to whatever services you need ( and might provide ) ? 
  at least finland has so colorful wooden houses that this photo would be considered more like `` more saturated '' than `` oversaturated '' . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.visitporvoo.fi/easydata/customers/porvoonmatkailu2/files/taustakuvat/jokiranta_talvi1500x1001.jpg ) for example . 
  it 's not necessarily that much oversaturated . 
  an overcast weather makes colors generally more saturated , as the illumination is very even and very neutral , so there 's not strong contrasts to offset the camera exposure . 
  strong colors like this are also more common in areas with a lot of wooden buildings . 
  compare to [ this ] ( https://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4z1169sky1qateomo1_1280.jpg ) in canada and [ this ] ( http://www.rul.fi/porvoo/files/2011/12/porvoo-03.jpg ) in finland . 
  ah yea , east regime would perhaps be better . 
  koirineen is a comitative too in finnish , but is extremely formal and almost never used in spoken language and it has a slightly different meaning from the `` koiran kanssa '' , with different origin and morphology as the finnish comitative also has a possessive suffix , the suffixes being koiri-ne-en with the - ne being the comitative and - en being the possessive suffix . 
  one can say in finnish `` i talked with the reception '' = * puhuin vastaanoton kanssa * , but not with the comitative form , * puhuin vastaanottoineni * as that would be more like * i spoke with my reception * or * i spoke along with my reception * . 
  said finnish comitative also is always is in plural form , so it literally means * i spoke with my receptions * . 
  this is why i said finnish does not have a comitative case like estonian has , meaning the finnish one is very different from the kind estonian has . 
  yes , all of those are said proper words in finnish ( though fear is * pelko * and someone fearing is * pelk\u00e4\u00e4 * ) . 
  though i think the sense of archaic in those words comes maybe from that the languages have given primary to some other words , as some estonian words have an archaic , even poetic meaning in finnish . 
  death in finnish is * kuolema * , but apparently in estonian its * surm * . 
  `` surma '' in finnish is a poetic term for dying , especially when it 's not a natural death . 
  love in finnish is * rakkaus * , whereas in estonian it seems to be * armastus * and is used as a verb too . 
  in finnish * armas * is a poetic archaic adjective meaning loved one , dear one . 
  evening is * ilta * in finnish , but in estonian it 's * \u00f5htu * , which is an archaic , more poetic word * ehtoo * in finnish . 
  iirc after wwii male names ** voitto ** and ** taisto ** became more popular . 
  they mean `` victory '' and `` battle '' . 
  then there are poor women whose first name is ** anu ** and their surename is something like ** skytt\u00e4 ** or ** saukko ** ( otter ) , making their names phrases like * anus kytt\u00e4 * ( anus cop ) or * anus aukko * ( anus hole ) . 
  i did n't find a better word . 
  i saw a comparison of estonian and finnish languages from 1000 years ago . 
  i could pretty much understand both . 
  finnish is like a more archaic version of estonian . 
  finnish has many features which have since eroded away from estonian or taken new forms . 
  an example are the many end letters in finnish words which estonian has lost but are still evident in estonian inflected forms . 
  as a prime example for the estonian word `` linn '' , finnish still retains the older form : linn * a * . 
  the genitive `` linna '' in estonian brings up the lost vowel , but that genitive form itself has lost the end letter still present in the finnish genitive : `` linna * n * '' . 
  tallinn in finnish is tallinna , literally `` tal-castle '' or `` dane-castle '' , but in estonian the word for castle has gone the same evolution burg has in german , it has come to mean an urban dwelling , city . 
  many estonian inflected words have an end letter that is still part of the nominative form in finnish . 
  so the letters that come up in many estonian inflections are not arbitrary , but they are remnants of the word before it eroded into shorter . 
  the estonian comitative case is also interesting example how a separate word has transformed into a suffix case . 
  if my estonian serves me right , `` with a dog '' would be koera * ga * . 
  finnish does not have a comitative case like this . 
  instead `` with a dog '' in proper finnish is `` koiran * kanssa * '' , or `` dog * with * '' . 
  in spoken finnish this is shortened to `` koiran * kans * '' or `` koiran * kaa * '' . 
  this evolution has given a new suffix in estonian , the comitative - ga. . estonian has also lost vowel harmony . 
  the vowel harmony still present in finnish is that front vowels \u00e4 , \u00f6 and y ( estonian \u00fc ) can not be in the same word as back vowels a , o and u. finnish and estonian also both have stress on the first syllable . 
  this stress has resulted that estonian has lost front vowels \u00e4 , \u00f6 and \u00fc outside the first syllable of the word . 
  for example estonian h\u00e4da , `` emergency '' in finnish is `` h\u00e4t * \u00e4 * '' . 
  estonian s\u00f6\u00f6vad `` they eat '' in finnish is sy\u00f6v * \u00e4 * t. s\u00f6\u00f6vad / sy\u00f6v\u00e4t on the other hand is an rarer example of evolution that has happened in finnish , but not in estonian . 
  finnish has evolved so that the double vowels of stressed syllables change into diphthongs . 
  for example the original name for sweden in baltic finnish was rootsi , and it still is in estonian , but in finnish the stressed double vowel has changed into a diphthong r * uo * tsi . 
  language/tongue in original baltic finnish is keeli , but in finnish the double vowel has turned into k * ie * li . 
  this phenomena also happens within finnish dialects , as finnish words like `` k\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00e4\u00e4 '' and `` v\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00e4\u00e4 '' in eastern finnish dialects are `` ki\u00e4ntee '' and `` vi\u00e4ntee '' . 
  to my understanding estonian is `` more evolved '' because for most of the last 1000 years , estonia has been more densely populated , and finland more sparsely populated which is why finnish has remained more archaic . 
  oh darn , i assumed too much . 
  in general finnish has the tendency to drop the consonant clusters / add a vowel to the end . 
  like swedish strand -  finnish ranta , swedish skola -  finnish koulu , russian gramata -  finnish raamattu , swedish frisk -  finnish riski . 
  estonian is basically more evolved finnish with strain of german instead of swedish . 
  the area where moscow is was inhabited by finno-ugric speakers before slavic people moved to the area ( and there still are [ finno-ugric speakers there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#/media/file:fenno-ugrian_languages.png ) . 
  finnish was never spoken there , as finnish developed around the gulf of finland . 
  some googling says this : `` one of the colonized territories was moscovia . 
  moscow ( moskva ) itself was founded in 12th century as one of the outward posts of the empire deep in the forests occupied by native finno-ugric tribes , the ancestors of modern russians ( 80 % of the topographic names in the modern central russia have the finno-ugric roots including the name of the moskva-river that means `` the dirty water '' ) . '', 
  ( sourced to http://ukraine-today.com/reference/facty/facty-hist.shtml in 2004 ) ( in finnish `` moska '' means dirt , goo , messy stuff ) `` no academic is able to give a precise interpretation of the word ` moscow ' , he wo n't dare either to guess the exact age of the city or to explain why it was moscow that in the 15th century became the capital of the russian state . 
  by common consent scholars take it that the fortress on borovitzky hill was named after the river flowing by . 
  over the centuries many historians have been trying to interpret the meaning of the word moscow . 
  there exists an ugro-finnish theory which interprets the name of the river as ` cow 's river ' or ` bear ' . 
  nowadays most historians tend to accept the slavic interpretation of the name moscow as ` boggy , swampy ' , which reflects the natural characteristics of the landscape . '', 
  ( sourced to http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/...sia.pdf/2-7.pdf in 2004 ) `` the capital of russia takes its name from the river moskva on which it sits . 
  the river , in turn , takes its name from the finno-ugrian word for water . '', 
  ( sourced to http://www.nutcracker.com/press_room/press_room_fun_facts.html in 2004 ) ( i 'd note on that that the finno-uralic word for water is n't maybe likely , as the word tends to be different . 
  finnish : vesi , estonian : vesi , hungarian : v\u00edz , sami : \u010c\u00e1hci ) `` the origin of the name is unknown , although several theories exist .
