  the most reliable theory is that the name derives from finno-ugric moska tribe who lived along the moskva river . 
  their main settlement was named moskova which suggest some connections to karelia and tshuudis . 
  one theory suggests that the source of the name is an ancient finnic language , in which it means `` dark '' and `` turbid . '', 
  alternatively , the name may come from the finno-permic komi language , meaning `` cow-river '' or from the finno-volgaic mordovian language , meaning `` bear-river '' . 
  in tatar-turkic languages this wooden finno-ugrian settlement was also called moskova . '', 
  http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/moscow#name ( in finnish , bear-river is karhujoki and cow-river is lehm\u00e4joki . 
  dark is tumma , synkk\u00e4 and turbid is samea , haalea , sakea . ), 
  most of the names are just modified versions of the original pronounced names with changes to accommodate finnish language : no consonant clusters in the beginning , less foreign letters ( b , c , e , f , q , x , z , \u00e5 ) and names end in vowels . 
  for example `` france '' sounds about `` frans '' to finnish speakers . 
  drop the foreign letter and consonant cluster in the beginning , ad a vowel to the end -  ranska . 
  iceland in nearby languages is pronounced to finnish ear like `` islant '' , ad a vowel to the end -  islanti . 
  for the rest , collected explanations from this thread expanded : alankomaat ( netherlands ) = ` alanko ' means ' a lowland ' , ` maa ' means ' a land ' or ' a country ' . 
  ` maat ' is the plural nominative of the word ` maa ' . 
  so literally , ` lowland lands ' -- netherlands . 
  iso-britannia ( great britain ) = big britain , though the actual name united kingdom is * yhdistynyt kuningaskunta * , a literal translation of united kingdom . 
  it\u00e4valta ( austria ) = east power ruotsi ( sweden ) = from old swedish * ro\u00fes - ( `` related to rowing '' ) , probably from roslagen where finns and swedes supposedly first met . 
  it further derives from proto-germanic * r\u014dan\u0105 ( `` to row '' ) , ultimately from proto-indo-european * h \u2081 reh \u2081 - ( also meaning `` to row '' ) . 
  of the same origin is also the finnish ryss\u00e4 , a pejorative for russians . 
  saksa ( germany ) = from the german area saxony . 
  ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ( russia ) = from proto-germanic * wene\u0111 - ( `` slav '' ) . 
  it relates to the wends , a historical name given by germanic peoples to slavs living near them , itself originating from latin veneti . 
  this was a name given by the greeks and romans to tribes living along the river vistula as well as those in north-eastern italy , in the area now known as venice/veneto ( venetia ; you can see the connection ) . 
  valko-ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ( belarus ) = translates to white-russia . 
  viro ( estonia ) = from the north estonian region by the name of virumaa . 
  edit : on the pronounciation as a source for names . 
  edit 2 : [ i was wrong on the case of france ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41845h/country_names_in_finnish/cz0olfx ) , though in general finnish has the tendency to finnish words in that way . 
  edit 3 : translation of united kingdom added . 
  if you want to use that as an argument here , at least present an argument .

  while for western far right nationalism the unifying factor tends to be heritage , ethnicity , `` race '' , for radical muslims it 's religion . 
  radical muslims do tend desire a geographic territory where their religion would unify people . 
  that 's the reason the us foreign policy in middle east is seen invasive by many muslims . 
  it 's the us invading the muslim world , which according to radical muslims should be an unified nation under allah . 
  from western perspective this is not that evident , as we tend to see nationalism equating to nation-state , but for radical islam , the nation is n't that much about the population of a certain de jure state , but about people of certain religion . 
  for example isis or saudi-arabia both unify their people in a certain geographic territory , not through ethnic nationalism like western far right does , but through religion . 
  the radical islam view is a nation united by religion . 
  radical islamism exists outside the western political map , as the western political map is n't universal , but merely descriptive of the western political world . 
  but if one were to place radical islamism on the western political map , it would be most close to the western far right . 
  thus in a discussion like this it 's pretty understandable to say radicali islamists are the arab far right as an analogue , kind of like one can say '' ______ is the machiavelli of poland '' . 
  that 's not a literal claim some person is the actual machiavelli , but rhetoric tool to point out how similar someone is to the actual machiavelli . 
  yea , most of those can be said about the ussr , but not all of them , making radical islamism closer to far right than far left . 
  and when it comes to far right and far left , i also believe in the [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/political_spectrum_horseshoe_model.svg/1280px-political_spectrum_horseshoe_model.svg.png ) , that radical ends of the left-right spectrum end up being more similar to each other than the center of the political spectrum . 
  uh , those old ladies are like lady gaga aged 70 . 
  but in their ideology they have strong similarities with far right : strong authoritarian state which upholds and forces the people to follow an ideology of national unity , sees some people as inherently inferior to their own and which is also used to trample civil liberties , and is used to uphold and justify strong traditional hierarchy and conservative values in the system . 
  that 's a surprisingly high percentage . 
  alcoholic people sleeping on park benches is a vastly more common problem than homeless people sleeping in benches in finland . 
  helsinki has fairly good shelters for homeless people so they rarely have to sleep around , and when they do , they do n't do it next to the busiest street in helsinki in the front yard of the parliament building , where that photo is taken from . 
  yea , it 's sad . 
  also worth considering is that those linked benches are in the front yard of the parliament building extension in the very center of helsinki , in a so called `` parade place '' . 
  the wind is blowing from right to left too . 
  this is already done in finland at least . 
  they study the dialects of the applicants , they ask details about their purported origin like `` if you are from this district of this city , describe what it looks like '' and `` what was the weather like when you left '' and so on . 
  killed by religion without the help of people , or killed by people following the religion ? 
  the belief system only exist because people believe in it and uphold it . 
  religion does not exist without people upholding it . 
  religion exists as people who follow it . 
  comparison to nazis is not a good one . 
  `` german '' is not a synonym to adherent of nazi ideology . 
  merkel is german , but does not adhere to nazi ideology . 
  but muslim means adherent to islamic religion . 
  by definition someone following islamic religion is a muslim , and muslim follows islamic religion . 
  though being muslim is not something you are only playing . 
  it does n't operate like a game , so game metaphors do n't apply . 
  modern islam = the contemporary islamic religion with all it 's variations , including jihadists . 
  what is modern islam if not the people who adhere to it ? 
  elections tell how well the voters think the ruling parties have handled issues . 
  they are not a measure of how well the issues actually were handled . 
  yes , it 's nice when people think it is [ okay for individuals to murder other people if it 's done `` for the right cause '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_2015_paris_attacks ) . 
  something good from the yellow press : in finland they introduced the term `` seksihelle '' , * sex heat * after writing an article about someone having sex in a park during a summer heat wave . 
  now summer heat waves are sometimes colloquially referred as * sex heats * , which imo is ridiculously awesome word . 
  i think the difference from +4 to -6 feels greater than from -6 to -30 . 
  i mean , after freezing temperature it 's all pain and nuisance anyway . 
  the weather of finland is more strongly influenced by the continental weather of russia , so the continental hard winter weather sometimes spills to finland . 
  then the yellow press has headlines like `` siberian chaos blizzard invades finland '' or something targeted to microrussophobia in finnish readers . 
  that 's because the roaming ban is n't in force yet . 
  the linked article says it will come in force june 2017 . 
   an independent constitutional court i 'd note that many countries do n't have a constitutional court at all , for example the nordic countries all lack a constitutional court . 
  not just your every day child pornography , but golden shower child pornography !, 
  but does n't this specifically ban selling packages that are more expensive to use abroad than in the native country ? 
  and i also doubt that it 's legal to sell packages that do n't work in other countries , as that would be discrimination based on country . 
  for example if i buy a computer from germany to finland , they can not charge me extra price for the computer just because i live in finland or make it so that the computer does n't work in finland . 
  the point with roaming removal is to make the phone and data markets also single market like this , and that the market is truly one market and i can buy a mobile packet from the country where it is the cheapest , and i pay the same price as the people in that country . 
  thanks , dad . 
   the problem is that you somehow feel obliged to oppose me and must counter every my word . 
  it 's called discussion . 
  if you feel it 's a problem that someone replies to your comment , do n't write comments . 
  problem solved . 
   some expect that being gay is kind of universal , global thing and homosexual relationships are to be introduced in every other country on their conditions . 
  it 's a human thing , just like being left handed . 
  and yes , just like i expect left handed people are treated equally with right handed people , i expect gay people to be treated equally with straight people . 
  we can build huge pumps which pump rising water away from the oceans . 
  this stream of water can be funneled to hydroelectric power plants which are then used to power the pumps . 
  deviant weather happens even without climate change . 
  climate is the average of weather , so an individual deviant weather can not really be attributed easily to climate change , but the statistical number of total deviant weather events can be . 
  it 's like throwing a mildly loaded dice . 
  the statistically most likely distribution for a normal dice would be 10 throws out of 60 being sixes . 
  but with a loaded dice out of 60 throws , 40 are sixes . 
  it can be then said the total number of sixes was caused by the weight , but is is much harder , if impossible to say which individual six was caused by the weight . 
  because he knows what is and what is not reported to happen in universities in italy . 
  if he has n't noted any reporting or news about the issue in italian universities , there 's more reason to assume there 's no issue than to assume there is an issue .
