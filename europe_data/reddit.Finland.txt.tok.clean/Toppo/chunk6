  what it seems is that you do n't even know how the eu operates , but rather that you have believed some general anti-eu stuff from the yellow press that has nothing to do with the actual workings of the european union . 
  you have so much irrational disdain towards the eu that you completely ignored that this post was not in any way about the eu , but about the russian invasion , but you just * could n't * use the opportunity to vomit your opinions about things that are no way relevant to the original post . 
  what our prime minister said about the uk in [ channel 4 interview ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/finnish-pm-i-dont-recognise-british-image-of-eu-video ) was quite good imo . 
   but they will be fed a lie or they will be fed a political ideology and goal you do n't agree with , and you label it as a `` lie '' so your opposition to a certain political ideology and goal would seen as a * moral stance against lying * instead of * your subjective personal viewpoint * . 
   all opinions are biased . 
  calling a voluntary joining `` annexation '' is so biased it is against the facts . 
   give it 30 years and they have lost independence , being brought into some sort of large european state eu nations have the right to leave the eu if they do n't like it . 
  this was made a legal right in the lisbon treaty . 
  likewise , eu nations have the freedom to support federal eu if they feel like it . 
  it is up to ukraine to decide what kind of relations they want with the eu . 
  saying ukraine is `` fucked over '' and being `` annexed '' by the eu is just absolutely ridiculous . 
  it is also absolutely disrespectful to the people who are actually * dying * because of the russian invasion , as if that is only as bad as joining the eu . 
  no , in pederasty penetration was also looked down ( though some still did it ) , as penetration lowered the younger boy to the level of a woman/slave , whereas pederasty was about free men having a master-apprentice relationship . 
  * `` annexation ( latin ad , to , and nexus , joining ) is the forcible acquisition of a state 's territory by another state . 
  '' * - max planck encyclopedia of public international law . 
  oxford university press . 
  if a country decides to join the eu , it is not annexing as no one is forced . 
  countries have the freedom to decide themselves . 
  norway , iceland and switzerland are examples of using that freedom and not joining . 
  your rhetoric is like calling consensual sex rape . 
  at least i acknowledged that the original post is propaganda , you are trying to portray your apparently strongly biased views as facts and turn this purely ukraine-russia thing into about your dislike about the eu . 
  at least the west is n't undermining their sovereignty , invading the country and annexing parts of it . 
  if ukraine is `` fucked over '' by the east , then the west is only flirting with ukraine . 
  the maiden in the painting represents ukraine , not the eu . 
  well , i made this six months ago . 
  for ancient greeks the sexual categories were n't straight/bi/gay , but penetrator/penetrated . 
  it was okay for man to stick his junk up the butt , but not to take it up his butt . 
  so the ancient greek version of `` it 's not gay if the balls do n't touch '' was `` it 's not gay if your butt is shut '' . 
  the original one is [ like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/suomineito.jpg ) . 
  edit : [ here 's background ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_finland ) about the history behind the original . 
  i would tend to agree , but the word `` i love '' , * rakastan * , sounds like some militaristic central asian oil nation and sand in gears . 
  that 's the formal written finnish . 
  in normal spoken finnish it 's '' * m\u00e4 rakastan sua * '' or some dialectical variation . 
  so let 's just agree that we disagree . 
   legal frameworks are stretched all the time in the face of realpolitik , and you are naive if you do n't acknowledge that . 
  remember wmd ? 
  yea , what about it ? 
  you are naive if you think that realpolitik is a magic word that you can use to back up any claim you make and ignore all the legal frameworks that work against your arguments . 
   do you really need me to list you the corrupt countries near bankruptcy in the eu ? 
  are you for real ? 
  ukraine is not a part of eu , and will not be in a long time , if ever , so how are the internal things of eu relevant ? 
   let me spell it out : the eu offered the trade agreement to ukraine because it was in nato 's interest , not our own . 
  of course it is the interest of eu to get extra-union states to be sympathetic towards eu and feel eu is for them , even though they are n't a part of eu . 
  why do you think nato is interested in ukraine ? 
  to grow it 's military influence and reach and to counter other military blocks . 
  in the same way eu is interested in growing it 's economic and political influence and countering other economic and political blocks . 
  having good relations with ukraine is only natural considering this interest of the eu , and seeing how russia reacts to it , it is very relevant of eu to have sanctions against russia . 
   the bits about `` being expected '' to act like a superpower we can ignore - expected by whom ? 
  under which legal framework ? 
  russia , china , the us and some european countries , it depends on the issue . 
  it 's not a legal framework as the term `` superpower '' itself is n't a legally formulated term . 
  but for example the balkan wars were seen by many as a failure of the eu , even thought it happened outside of the eu . 
  many saw that eu as a global player had a greater responsibility and should have done more to stop the conflict . 
  this is something that is often expected from superpowers , strong interference outside your borders . 
  likewise during the cop15 negotiatons in copenhagen many expected eu to wield greater power along with the us and china , but many saw it as a failure that eu did not wield power like the us and china , as people were expecting the eu to wield power like a superpower . 
  the eu as a superpower has been a serious subject for some time : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potential_superpowers#european_union, 
  you are naive if you ignore the legal frameworks . 
  yes i ignored `` just look at ukraine '' because that is n't an argument as such and it is not my job to make up arguments for you . 
   did the eu need another corrupt bankrupt country to add to the list , and the risk of alienating russia and screwing up their economies with sanctions ? 
  what `` list '' are you referring to ? 
  and as in the global level the eu is often expected to act like a superpower wielding power outside it 's borders and taking interest in what happens outside , and eu is feeling more and more responsibility to act on issues outside it 's borders then yes , eu does have to take the risk of alienating russia and harming it 's own economy with sanctions , as eu itself takes interest in it 's back yard . 
  the revolution and war in ukraine started when the president rejected the trade agreement with the eu in favor of russia , so the case of ukraine is very relevant to the interest of eu . 
   what did the eu do ? 
  what nato wanted . 
  what actions are referring to specifically ? 
  calling other people `` naive '' does not prove your point . 
  there is not any sort of legal framework or agreements that forces the eu follow the policies of nato . 
  if a nato member would be under attack , it would not require finland to give military assistance in any way , as finland is not an nato member , and eu can not force finland to give military assistance to anyone , as the eu has no legal ways to demand it . 
  this is because the foreign policy of the eu is not the same as nato . 
  say for example the uk were under military attack . 
  it being a part of eu does not set requirements for finland to assist the uk . 
  but if finland were a part of nato , the uk could require finland to assist the uk . 
  posting links that do n't prove your point does not prove your point . 
  i did not deny that finland is a western country . 
  i 'm saying that being a western country does not equate military alliance with nato . 
  take switzerland for example . 
  it would be ridiculous to claim that by realpolitik they are a nato country just because they are a western country . 
  and there are several levels of being allied . 
  being politically and economically allied with eu and the west does not equate being militarily allied . 
  no , it is not . 
  the west = / = nato . 
  to make that clear : the formal form of singular `` you '' ( sin\u00e4 ) is the same as plural `` you '' ( te ) . 
  nowdays it is mostly used on customer services which demands respect , extremely formal social situations or when addressing elderly people you do n't know . 
  it also affects how you inflect the words , like the question `` do you want '' in normally is `` haluatko sin\u00e4 '' , but the formal form inflects the verb according to the person so it becomes `` halu * atteko * te '' . 
  there 's also somewhat formal/informal third person pronoun divide . 
  `` he/she '' in written language and in formal speech is `` h\u00e4n '' , but in normal everyday speech `` he/she '' is '' * se * '' , which also means `` it '' . 
  so in normal speech when you say `` she is a very nice girl '' , technically what is said is '' ** it ** is a very nice girl '' . 
   another one : `` asta e '' meaning kinda `` so is life ''  instead of doing something about a problem , one says `` asta e '' . 
  oh god we have that in finnish too and it 's fucking annoying . 
  it originated from a cell phone operator ad campaign where someone did something ridiculous and expensive , like used money bills to heat a fireplace or bought 1000 garden gnomes and someone would comment `` is n't that expensive '' , and other would reply `` so is life '' . 
  then the ad would bang `` life is expensive , our operator is cheap '' . 
  the saying went to so extremes that there were anecdotal reports on how someone in danger would yell `` help me !, 
  this man is dangerous '' and some replied `` so is life '' without actually doing anything . 
  luckily the saying has mainly faded away now . 
  i did n't see him thinking they would want to , but * wishing * they would want to and that they would fill the criteria . 
   in general it ' a very expensive place to live if you do n't earn near or over 2 per month . 
  would not say that . 
  many young people and students with part time jobs live in places like kallio , t\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 , vallila and so on even though they get like a bit over 1k per month and have no financial problems . 
  and it 's worth noting that when living in central areas , you are not only paying for the size of the flat , but also for the location . 
  sure , 700 $ for a 30m2 flat might be expensive , but if the metro station , public services , city center and so on are very close , it is reflected in the price .
