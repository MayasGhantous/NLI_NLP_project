  that snow map is bad . 
  there 's no sense having one zone as 50-99 % and another as 100 % . 
  why not have each zone covering equal percentage of the whole ? 
  well , i 've heard that norway technically has more lakes . 
  most of finnish fire arms are large hunting weapons , rifles and so on . 
  so people do n't carry them in their purses , pockets , keep them in their night stands or drive around with fire arms in the car glove department . 
  so finland does n't really have small handguns lying around like toys , resulting in less gun crime . 
  i was reading r/askreddit thread for people who have killed other people . 
  many of them involved handguns . 
  incidents like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3wbiny/serious_redditors_who_have_lawfully_killed/cxv1f0e ) and [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3wbiny/serious_redditors_who_have_lawfully_killed/cxv4b75 ) do n't really happen with finnish gun rates . 
  not because of `` certain groups '' but because finnish people do n't carry hunting rifles around like hand guns are carried in the us . 
  and while your discussion is n't that much related to op 's link anymore , i 'd remind that the main focus of the news was how to stop the flow of illegal weapons , and the very headline of the news was * david cameron calls for eu crackdown on illegal firearms * . 
  op just posted a click bait headline targeted at the gun control debate audience . 
  cameron is n't suggesting banning all weapons , but banning semi-automatic weapons . 
  that 's a restriction on guns , not banning of guns . 
  so , basically / r/iwantout / . 
   male conscription in finland is a huge elephant in the room nobody is talking about in a country that claims to be among worlds best in equality . 
  the green party in finland has many times said the current situation is not equality and that men suffer from it , and it 's their official party line : * `` the current finnish conscription is already highly selective . 
  women , half of the age group are not selected for conscription [ ... ] the situation is problematic for gender equality , since military service is volutary for women and mandatory for men . 
  equality legislation has to apply to the armed forces too . 
  '' * jussi niinist\u00f6 , current defense minister from the finns party and carl haglund , former defense minister from the swedish party both have stated they support the current model . 
  likewise most finnish people support the current model . 
  so it 's not a elephant in the room or a political suicide to talk about it . 
  it 's just that the support for current system is so dominant that there 's not that much need or interest for discussion . 
  in finland the feminists are the ones who in the parliament have been most vocal about the inequality of the conscription . 
  but they also tend to support selective conscription , so they are n't pushing for mandatory conscription for all women just so that next they could campaign against mandatory conscription . 
   women only care about equality where it provides a direct benefit to them . 
  that 's a bold generalization . 
  there 's a difference between finland and us that finland does not have a constitutional court , and unlike in the us , a court can not find some legislation unconstitutional . 
  so there 's not even the possibility of suing the government for conscripting men only , as none of the courts have the legal power to overrule the practice . 
  the finnish constitution does say that everyone is equal before the law , and no one can be treated differently * without a valid reason * . 
  what constitutes a valid reason is a matter of parliamentary debating . 
  like with the same sex marriage initiative , the supporters argued that there is no valid reason to limit marriage to straight couples . 
  but there 's no court that could have ruled that the marriage limitation was unconstitutional . 
  the style actually has a name of its own . 
  uh , [ dem chairs ] ( http://store.hermanmiller.com/products/eames-soft-pad-management-chair ) . 
  hey what did i personally do to deserve this ? 
  well , pompeii was a shitty movie anyway . 
  the gif is from that . 
   everything you said is true . 
  so if you belief in the things i said , why you said this ? 
   i do n't believe things on faith , but from where i 'm sitting , feminist and religious claims are identical , they both tell me to believe things for which evidence is lacking at best . 
  by this you are saying that for female genital mutilation , unhealthy beauty standards , rape , and the poor position of women in developing countries , `` evidence is lacking at best '' . 
   i also believe that these problems , unlike women 's , are not mentioned because feminism stands on the ground that women are a unique class of victims ... and then you take an example how * a feminist * said women can be violent in domestic situations too , comparable to men ? 
  your own example disproves your claim on where feminism stands on . 
  from my anecdotal experience , men 's problems are not that visible because also men themselves are n't that interested in gender issues . 
  women have a long history for advocating their rights . 
  they have had to fight their right to vote , to have equal legal standing to men and so on . 
  men have historically been mostly oblivious to mens issues , as they have been in power ( so less motivation to be interested in gender issues ) and men have not realized they face gender specific issues as much as women do . 
  where i live there 's mandatory military service for men , but still most men are rather oblivious to the gender inequality of the issue , even though it is very obvious and it takes a toll for many men . 
  yet you failed to show any flaws in it . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it just makes it like most words we use . 
  its meaning comes from how people use it , not from some centralized agency . 
  most words are inherently fuzzy and hard , if not impossible to define universally . 
  well , i for one believe that the position of women in developing countries is worse than the position of men , and for example female genital mutilation is real . 
  i believe that women everywhere , also in the developed countries are subject to sexual violence and rape . 
  i believe women are subject to [ unhealthy beauty standards ] ( https://exposedtolife.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/ralph-lauren-ad1.jpg ) . 
  you are free to believe that women in developing countries are in the same position as men , that female genital mutilation is not real , that women are not raped and that the beauty standards for women are always healthy and realistic . 
  if you refuse to believe that those things are real , i do n't think this discussion is worthwhile . 
  there is no central feminism bureau which could give out `` officially recognized feminist '' seals to people , like palin . 
  who is and is not a feminist is a matter of perspective and debate . 
  are you misunderstanding by purpose ? 
  media has a bias for something extraordinary , exceptional , something that arouses strong emotions and taps into the existing beliefs , preconceptions , hopes and fears of people . 
  media does not have a bias for statistically accurate representations , the average , the mundane . 
  uh , there is no central feminism bureau , so there is no `` proper feminist response '' , as no one is in the position to speak in behalf of all feminists . 
  etymology merely tells the origin of a word , not what it should mean . 
  you ca n't really use etymology to dismiss some established use for a word . 
  which fruits are you looking at ? 
  the ones that stand out or the ones who do n't get into headlines ? 
  english pronunciation is complex as fuck though . 
  you are right that finnish has vowel harmony , but it 's the suffixes which change according to vowel harmony . 
  the word * talo * `` house '' is back vowels . 
  the word * y\u00f6 * `` night '' is front vowels . 
  the suffixes must obey vowel harmony , so `` in the house '' is * talossa * but `` in the night '' is * y\u00f6ss\u00e4 * , the suffix being - ss\u00e4 instead of - ssa . 
  and it goes on like * talosta * `` from/of the house '' / * y\u00f6st\u00e4 * `` from/of the night '' where the suffix is - sta or - st\u00e4 depending on the vowels of the stem word . 
  i once deconstructed the entire word and the definitions are so conflicting with each other that in closer inspection the explanation is worthy of an entire chapter . 
  it 's much longer than that . 
  many horrendous inflected words in finnish can be written with several shorter words and that 's how people usually do when speaking . 
  for example * talossanikin * , `` in my house also '' in normal spoken finnish would be * munki talossa * or `` my-also house-in '' , mun-ki talo-ssa . 
  it 's kind of like what do words like `` from '' , `` at '' , `` in '' , `` on '' , `` with '' , `` even '' , `` as '' in english mean . 
  most of those words are not really used . 
  that list is merely the list of grammatically possible correct forms . 
  it does n't mean those forms are common . 
  perhaps compared to english , finnish is a very open ended and flexible language . 
  in finnish the category '' * words which are grammatically possible but you really do n't need to know * '' is much larger than in english . 
  so a list of 2000 forms of `` dog '' seems intimidating , but tells more about the grammatical flexibility of the language , not about the complexity of the actual used language . 
  so the complexity kind of is how in english the word order of prepositions , post-positions and such is very complex . 
  `` john loves mary '' has a different meaning from `` mary loves john '' , `` inside my dog was a house in fire '' is a different meaning from `` my fire was in a dog inside a house '' . 
  both forms are grammatically correct , are made of the same words but have very different , even nonsensical meanings . 
  this complexity of word orders and the possible semantic variations of it exist in noun forms instead of word order in finnish . 
   koirinensa-with his/her dogs . 
  the funny thing here is that the finnish comitative case here can only exist in plural . 
  so even if a person has only one dog , in finnish you say `` koirinensa '' , with his/her dogs . 
  even though there 's only one dog , the grammatically correct comitative is `` h\u00e4n tuli koirinensa puistoon '' he/she came to the park with his/her ** dogs ** . 
  there is an interesting example in finnish and estonian how an inflection is evolving from an independent word . 
  `` kanssa '' in finnish means `` with '' . 
  so `` koiran kanssa '' is `` with a dog '' . 
  in spoken finnish , many say `` koiran kaa '' , or very fastly * koirankaa * . 
  in estonian this has evolved into a proper inflection case - ga , so `` with a dog '' in estonian is * koeraga * , with the origin of the comitative case - ga suffix being an independent word which still exists as `` kanssa '' in finnish .
