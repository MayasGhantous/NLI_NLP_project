  i think finns generally avoid long inflections as the different suffixes do n't really form any logical semantic order and are hard to comprehend . 
  like `` taloistammekaankahoan '' is literally * houses - ( out of which ) - ours-neither-maybe-also * . 
  just like the english phrase , for finns takes conscious effort to understand what the heck does the finnish word even mean , so finns avoid longer words like that , instead saying `` ei ehk\u00e4 meid\u00e4nk\u00e4\u00e4n taloista '' or * maybe neither from our houses * . 
  that is much easier to understand and uses shorter words . 
  but can result in horrible technically grammatically correct word constructions , like * ep\u00e4j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llistytt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6myydell\u00e4\u00e4ns\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00f6h\u00e4n * which is grammatically correct , is not a compound word and i have no idea what it means , as the suffixes form such a complex network of definitions that the meaning transcends the ability of human consciousness to comprehend abstractions . 
  as an example how arbitrary and nonsensical some of those are : * kauppoinemmekinkohan * , literally `` i wonder if even with our shop ( s ) ? '', 
  the inflection has an extremely limited usage . 
  now i can imagine a sentence where that is used , * kauppoinemmekinkohan teemme turisteihin vaikutuksen ? 
  * or `` i wonder if we will impress the tourists even with our shops ? '', 
  now , as a native finnish speaker , i 'm not even sure if that is the grammatically correct context . 
  native speakers simply do n't use those forms so much . 
  when saying `` i wonder if we will impress the tourists even with our shops ? '', 
  i would claim finns do n't even think about those long inflections , but rather say `` teemmek\u00f6h\u00e4n turisteihin vaikutuksen edes kauppojemme kanssa '' where `` kauppoinemmekinkohan '' is broken in to separate words to make it easier to understand . 
  well , if inflection in hungarian works the same way as in finnish , it 's simply that the language replaces some pronouns , prepositions and post-positions and such with inflections . 
  for example the english phrase `` in my house also '' uses separate pre & post-positions and pronouns , but finnish the prepositions and pronouns can be inflected forms of the word * talo * , `` house '' . 
  so it 's * talossanikin * , literally the suffix order being * house-in-my-also * , or * talo-ssa-ni-kin * . 
  it 's not that far fetched from the idea that english would have inflections so that `` in my house also '' would be one inflected word , * houseinmyalso * and that would be understood just as variant of saying `` house '' . 
  edit : or that finnish would just use postopositions extensively and `` in my house also '' would simply be a phrase * talo sa ni kin * instead of one word . 
  edit 2 : and the reason for so many inflected forms is just that the different suffixes can be combined almost endlessly : * talossanikin * is `` in my house also '' , * taloissanikin * is `` in my houses also '' , * talostanikin * is `` from/of my house also '' , * taloistanikin * is `` from/of my houses also '' , * talostaniko * is `` from/of my house ? 
  '' , * taloistaniko * is `` from/of my houses ? '', 
  while grammatically correct , most of these forms are n't used in spoken language that much . 
  people tend to avoid suffix clusters and use separate words instead . 
  * instead of * talostaniko * , both meaning `` from/of my house also ? '', 
  the median is around 3000 euros before taxes . 
  after finnish comes hungary ( a related language of finnish ) with even more inflected possibilities for the hungarian word `` dog '' . 
  no , it 's correct . 
  the meaning is n't the same , but the words are cognates . 
  the finnish word peruna comes from old swedish word `` jordp\u00e4ron '' or * earth pear * . 
  swedish p\u00e4ron of course is related to english pear . 
  edit : it 's comparable to finnish * rauta * and english * red * which are cognates , but with a different meaning . 
  edit 2 : `` peruna '' means potato in finnish as old swedish referred potatoes as earth pears , and `` rauta '' means iron in finnish , referring to the reddish color of rust . 
  i think finnish is a very nice language . 
  for example [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp60g4rowik ) sounds beautiful , and the lyrics also use the language beautifully to combine melancholy and nature . 
  also , the flexibility of finnish never ceases to amaze me . 
  the word `` ajatella '' , * to think * literally means * to make someone drive around aimlessly * , inflected from the word `` ajaa '' , * to drive * . 
  that does n't mean there are not similarities . 
  most of the vocabulary of finnish is indo-european origin and one can see their similarity to words in english for example . 
  like * ranta * = strand , * kirkko * = church , * koulu * = school , * mestari * = master , * tuoli * = stool , * peruna * = pear , * tyt\u00e4r * = daughter . 
  there are several words which are more obviously similar to scandinavian languages , russian and german . 
  and when looking at ie-languages , the inflection of latin conceptually does n't seem that far from finnish . 
  a lot of cases and ways to inflect the words with those cases . 
  i think the reputation of finnish as a particularly difficult language comes from the idea that unrelated languages must be difficult ( which they must not be ) and that for english speakers , finnish grammar can be troublesome . 
  and the `` swedish minority '' is actually more of a technical term . 
  every finnish person who decides to announce their mother tongue as swedish is seen as swedish speaking minority , even though one would have learned the language as an adult . 
  likewise many people who come from a swedish speaking family and are bilingual , but mark finnish as their mother tongue instead of swedish , are not officially swedish speaking minority . 
  i did n't generalize . 
  `` in general '' means commonly , usually , for the most part . 
  like * women in general do n't have beards * . 
  that 's not a generalization that all women are beardless , but that commonly , usually , for the most part women do n't have beards . 
  you can always find a bearded woman , and you can always find a radical of some ideological branch . 
   the regressive left do , you ca n't put them all in one box or generalise . 
  uh , i specifically said leftists and socialists * in general * do n't support those things . 
   it is france 's prerogative to not allow these marches ** out of fear ** of an attack gee , i wonder why ** terrorism ** is called terrorism . 
  france admitted it in the same year , only few months after the bombing , when they were caught and it was evident france did it . 
  they apologized and admitted what they did it after they were caught . 
  they did n't really have any other choice than to apologize and admit what they did , as it was obvious what they did , and in my view that in no way guarantees it is impossible for them to repeat their errors . 
  like if some politician is caught of lying and taking bribes , and after being caught admits and apologizes , i think there is a point to remind people of that if people start thinking how trustworthy the politician is . 
  i , for one , have not noticed that a ) france has a tendency to do bad stuffs and b ) every time acts by ps are used as examples . 
  reading of parti socialiste , they seem to be a social democrat center-left party , and if the political field in france is similar to my native finland , social democrats are not seen ideologically that leftist , nor they are seen defining the left in the country . 
  rather they represent the moderate establishment with leftist elements ( hence ps is * center * - left ) . 
  france has a separate leftist parties , * parti de gauche * , or left party and * parti communiste fran\u00e7ais * or french communist party . 
  imo it 's a common feature in democracies that the largest parties are rather moderate and compromised in their views compared to the right and left wing of the country , and the major parties tend to be center-right or center-left . 
  and for example the average stance of a center-left party is closer to the center-right party than the left wing of national politics . 
  and the average view of a center-right party is closer to the center-left party rather than the right wing of national politics . 
  so my guess would be that in france * parti socialiste * on average is closer to the center-right party * les r\u00e9publicains * than the left * parti de gauche * and * parti communiste fran\u00e7ais * . 
  likewise the * les r\u00e9publicains * probably is closer to * parti socialiste * than the right-wing * front national * and * mouvement pour la france * . 
  ethnic nationalism , conservatism , opposition to minorities , support/acceptance of social hierarchies and support for authoritarian measures to enforce them are commonly seen as defining features of far right . 
  many people oppose these goals , and because of that , oppose far-right movements . 
  however suppression of civil rights and bombing of civilians are not commonly seen as defining features of left politics . 
  parti socialiste , or other left parties ( to my knowledge ) have not stated that their goal is to bomb protesters and suppress civil rights . 
  so people do n't oppose french socialists and leftists because leftists and socialists in general do n't support bombing of protesters and suppression of civil rights . 
  * thunderous applause *, 
  [ i already did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3v4eou/woman_fined_1000_for_refusing_to_be_fingerprinted/cxkbap3 ) . 
  current leaders are from a totally different generation as those 30 years ago , true . 
  but then again , obama has n't closed guantanamo . 
  just because the world changes , the change itself does not mean repeating of history is impossible . 
  lack of cold war as such does not mean repeating of history is impossible . 
  difference in domestic and foreign policies as such does not mean repeating of history is impossible . 
  different geopolitical context does not mean repeating of history is impossible . 
  existence of eu does not mean repeating of history is impossible . 
  if we have confidence that difference alone is enough to prevent repeating mistakes , mistakes will be made . 
  why would n't it be relevant ? 
  it 's an example how france , a modern democratic western country can significantly overreact and even break basic rights when opposing environmental protesters . 
  just saying `` it 's not relevant '' does not mean it 's not relevant . 
  i say it is relevant . 
  so it is relevant . 
  since 2009 every new eu passport has to have fingerprints in digital data . 
  do you think this fingerprint database should be given to police and intelligence agencies so they can identify which of us is a criminal ? 
  my friend who was arrested in sweden was n't fingerprinted . 
  another friend of mine who was arrested in finland was n't fingerprinted . 
  what france did 30 years ago is completely relevant example on how france as a modern western developed democracy can behave . 
  it 's a reminder of what is possible . 
  but you are saying we should ignore history , not learn from it . 
  `` stop bringing this up '' you say . 
  discussing about modern society and politics would be rather dull if history older than 25 + years should be ignored . 
  edit : i 'd appreciate if you would n't afterwards edit additional sentences like you did '' * the people arrested the other day were n't peaceful protesters * '' to your comment . 
  but seeing how you did , i 'll reply to it here too . 
  the police arrested more than 300 people . 
  out of those only two appeared before the court . 
  and according to the news , the woman was sentenced only of disobeying police orders ( which she says she did n't hear ) .
