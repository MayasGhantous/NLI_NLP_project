  there is no court verdict on the woman being violent in any way . 
  there is no reason to state the woman was n't a peaceful protester , as the demonstration originally had peaceful environmental organizations protesting . 
  in essence the police can detain peaceful protesters by afterwards saying they gave orders , or giving orders in a way which is impossible to hear . 
  no , it 's not . 
  but history hurts my feelings !, 
  i think it 's entirely relevant to bring it up if one is worried about the direction france is heading , and in this particular case it 's how france is dealing with environmental protesters . 
  it 's not like knowing history ever hurt anyone . 
  france has the potential [ for much worse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_of_the_rainbow_warrior ) . 
  think harder . 
  that k\u00e4ssiv\u00e4rssisani does n't mean anything . 
  k\u00e4sivarsissani would mean `` in my arms '' . 
  k\u00e4ssiv\u00e4rssisani does n't mean anything . 
  k\u00e4sivarsissani would mean `` in my arms '' . 
  there 's only one of his kind alive - himself . 
  religion is a part of culture . 
  why are the specific circumstances `` local cultural reasons '' and not just `` cultural reasons '' ? 
  why not ban the use of masks at traditional festivities like carnivals ? 
   no because you ca n't compare not allowing people to wear masks , to not allowing people to be homosexual . 
  so you are saying `` it 's not common '' is not a valid argument then , because that argument could be used against basic freedoms of people , like the right to be homosexual ( or be publicly homosexual ) . 
   but we 're not talking about differently colored masks , but masks vs no masks . 
  so you agree that `` you do n't have to cover your face '' is no argument to ban covering faces . 
   what you should be arguing about is not why masks are banned , but whether the ban is effective . 
  we would need scientific studies for that . 
  if the ban is n't effective at achieving its goal , then it 's useless and masks should be allowed again . 
  so , have there been scientific studies that the ban * would be * effective for public safety ? 
  if not , there 's no scientific basis for the ban . 
  also , it is not just about scientific studies . 
  it is also about ethics of freedoms and rights . 
  it would probably be scientifically the safest option to strip people of their personal privacy and go full nsa so police can monitor public safety . 
  but is that the moral choice ? 
   fair point , but these features all ca n't conceal your face the way a mask can . 
  but they can make it significantly hard to recognize people still , and in the case of beards an long hair , you might need to shave them to get the same appearance . 
   because there 's no real benefit to doing so , there is no reason for doing it other than `` because i can '' , at least i ca n't imagine any right now . 
  so what ? 
  what 's the benefit of wearing green clothes ? 
  t-shirt of your favourite band ? 
  having a haircut you like ? 
  having a nose piercing ? 
  they do n't have any other benefits than being self expression in a way you think looks nice . 
  encryption and privacy are also easy to exploit by criminals . 
  if we start stripping civil liberties in order to make police work easier , we move from liberal democracy to a police state . 
  so many questionable things can be argued for with `` otherwise there 's more work for police '' . 
  why should something be banned on the grounds `` it 's not common '' ? 
  should homosexuality be banned because `` it 's not common '' ? 
  you do n't * have to * wear green clothes either , but is that a reason to ban green clothes ? 
  just because something is n't absolutely necessary does not mean it should be banned . 
  people should have freedom of expression to utilize things which are not necessary . 
  skirts for women are not necessary ( they could wear pants ) , but that 's no argument for banning skirts . 
  the starting point for legislation should not be `` why should this be allowed '' but `` why should this be banned '' . 
  so it should not be up to others to argue why would people have to hide their faces . 
  it is up to those who want restrictions to argue why people should not be allowed to hide their faces . 
  as translated above :  `` exceptions include health security , climate and local cultural reasons '' ( einheimisch = `` local '' ) so no , it 's not a ban against all clothing that covers your face . 
  local cultural religions do have the right , but foreign culture religions do not . 
  it targets non-local religions and culture , and gives privilege to local cultures and religions . 
  that is n't really looking up to middle east but taking steps to something european countries have been in the past : more conservative with less civil rights . 
  european countries are not looking up to middle east , but rather conservatively trying to oppose middle eastern laws by making restrictions which specifically target middle eastern culture . 
  it 's more like european countries looking up to their right wing conservative past to form their laws . 
  not just few hundred years ago . 
  the northern ireland conflict had strong element of protestants vs. catholics . 
  imo that 's like banning prostitution on the grounds of stopping human trafficking . 
  the ban also has an effect on women who voluntarily take that action , and the ban punishes women whose actions have no victim . 
  if the problem is the custom of reducing women to objects by denying them an identity , the solution should be education and discussion about those attitudes that force some women to wear veils . 
  banning the result will not solve the attitude problem . 
  as a comparison , a lot of western ads reduce women to objects [ like this ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufyk5e0q_so/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  in that ad the woman is just legs and ass . 
  her face is n't even visible . 
  or like in [ this ad ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fc/8c/b5/fc8cb5c830ae85b36d458a833437ee99.jpg ) where woman is portrayed as someone who you bribe to get sex . 
  women are just objects you buy sex from . 
  but still , the dominant feminist approach to these kinds of ads * is not to limit the freedom of speech * which produces those , but to discuss the objectifying attitudes behind those ads . 
  if we take the same attitude we take with muslim veils , we should also have laws which ban advertisement and art which '' * are a tool used to reduce women to objects by denying them an identity * '' . 
  care to give an example ? 
  for the same reason you would hide your belly or thighs : you feel uncomfortable for being exposed like that . 
   because then the police might need to check every single person with a concealed face , because they might be wanted criminals trying to escape . 
  that also applies to beards , sunglasses , long hair , scarfs and so on , which can be used to change your appearance . 
  but we do n't ban them , right ? 
  if we start stripping civil liberties in order to make police work easier , we move from liberal democracy to a police state . 
  so many questionable things can be argued for with `` otherwise there 's more work for police '' . 
   no not really , because in public ( where you would hide your face ) you should n't expect any privacy in regards to people seeing your face . 
  why not ? 
  your trust issues are not relevant . 
  some christians do n't trust atheists but is that a reason to ban atheism ? 
  that 's a stupid law . 
  merely taking part of a demonstration is not reason to ban covering your face . 
  protesting [ like this ] ( http://cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/globe_photo/2008/02/10/1202700672_7670/539w.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/gallery/090402/gal-09apr02-1818/media/pho-09apr02-156577.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.travelchannel.com/content/dam/images/travel/fullset/2015/06/01/gay-pride-celebrations-slideshow/delhi-queer-pride-parade-flag-mask.jpg.rend.tccom.616.462.jpeg ) should remain completely legal . 
  banning covering intended to hide your face sounds to me like the idea of banning encryption intended to hide your communication . 
  both seem to based on the principle `` if you are innocent you do n't have anything to hide '' . 
   it 's an important step against rioters ( mostly after sports events ) , while at the same time helping with the integration of immigrants by softly forcing them to adapt to the local customs . 
  firstly , if the worry is hooligans and vandals , the law could just ban covering your face when the evident goal is to break other laws . 
  secondly , i do n't know about switzerland , but i 've always thought that western countries have a strong custom and tradition of civil liberties like freedom of expression . 
  banning certain kind of expression to `` softly force them to adapt to local customs '' is n't forcing to adapt local customs . 
  it is * changing * the local customs to restrict freedom of expression because some people are offended by different customs . 
  well technically the most of the rules of the old testament do n't apply to christians . 
  according to christianity , the the rules for punishment and other ways of society were set by god to jewish people to follow until god sends a savior . 
  christians view jesus being this savior and messiah , so christians do n't have to follow the rules for punishment of the old testament anymore . 
  if you ask a christian priest what a punishment for these should be according to the bible , the christian priest would ( or should ) say that the new testament supersedes the old testament , and jesus and new testament emphasizes forgiveness , compassion , love and truth . 
  in the new testament jesus literally saves an adultery woman from stoning and says `` let him who is without sin cast the first stone '' to the people who say laws of moses command them to stone her . 
  nokia actually still owns all the cell phone patents they had before the microsoft deal . 
  the deal with microsoft was that microsoft buys the actual practical cell phone operations ( research & development units , factories ) and the exclusive right to use the nokia cell phone patents and trademarks till the end of 2015 . 
  after that nokia is free to again use its patents to produce nokia cell phones , although they would be manufactured by third parties , as nokia sold the actual factories to microsoft . 
  i think singapore is a poor comparison , as it 's location is exceptional .
