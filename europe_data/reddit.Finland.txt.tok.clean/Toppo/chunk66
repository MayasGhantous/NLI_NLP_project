  singapore is located on the [ southern tip of malay peninsula ] ( http://worldweather.wmo.int/081/map00234.png ) and most of the marine traffic and shipments between far east and rest of eurasia & africa travel past singapore , which has for over a hundred years made singapore a crucial and significant trading place , currently having one of the largest harbors in the world and contributing to its economy . 
  i signed it because i want to hear mp 's debating about should we have a referendum or not . 
  i think that would be healthy for the public discussion about referendums , democracy and euro , regardless of who made the initiative in the first place . 
  the question is n't should we leave euro zone , but should we have a referendum about it . 
  it would be interesting to hear why the mp 's oppose referendum , especially when nato-membership is often said to be dependent on a referendum . 
  more context : ** the initiative does not demand leaving the euro zone , but demands a national referendum on euro membership ** , since there never was a referendum about euro membership . 
  the parliament is not debating should we leave the euro , but should we have a a national referendum about leaving the euro . 
  i do n't care that v\u00e4yrynen was the one who created the initiative . 
  i signed the initiative for the sake of creating public discussion about having a referendum on the issue . 
  that 's one of the consequences of citizen initiatives . 
  i think it is healthy to have a parliament debating on should there be a referendum of not . 
  we have n't had referendums in 20 years so it 's about time we have some public discussion on how much the citizens should be able to influence via referendums . 
  it 's relevant also because nato-membership is commonly seen to be dependent on referendum in finland , so parliament debating about referendum about euro membership is good in my opinion . 
  the father says '' * well , are you hungry or not ? 
  * '' and the tag line is '' * hard as life * '' and the voice over is about new kind of rye bread . 
   rye bread is not bread you fucking ingrates . 
  [ this finnish rye bread commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smusx8airyy ) says it all . 
  considering the purchasing power parity , [ still above uk and france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) for example . 
  i 'd expand with images that finns have extensively adapted wood to different styles and needs . 
  [ this neoclassical church ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ndjpzk95m-u/uykpa19zeii/aaaaaaaaaue/wb45ggcttou/s1600/vanha+kirkko.jpg ) in helsinki is built from wood to look like a stone building as neoclassical architecture was hip in those days . 
  [ this church tower ] ( http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/hae_kuva.aspx?id=104076&amp;ttyyppi=jpg&amp;kunta_id=272 ) is a wooden version of baroque architecture . 
  [ this church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/kerim%c3%a4en_kirkko_sis%c3%a4lt%c3%a4_2013_6.jpg ) is the largest wooden church in the world and has some neogothic and byzantine features . 
  i suspect most of the railway stations in finland are wooden buildings [ like this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dpdzvzqg784/uzp6erohxxi/aaaaaaaadoq/0bxbqay98na/s1600/lusto_asema.jpg ) . 
  the archetypal finnish dream is a falun red house [ like this ] ( http://www.lily.fi/sites/lily/files/user/642/2012/01/kuvankaappaus_2012-1-29_kello_13.08.13.png ) by a lake . 
  pretty much every large building company offers prefabricated wooden houses [ like this ] ( http://www.kastelli.fi/cdn-1cc8ef48e8d136a/global/talokuvat/kotikartano%20108-150/kotikartano107-149_01.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://kymppitallit.fi/sites/default/files/anttieo.jpg ) . 
  so wood has for a long time been the standard for building , and i think most finns feel wooden buildings are more warm , comfortable , humane , natural and such positive vibes . 
  edit : wood has also been utilized in modern construction , like [ sibelius music hall ] ( http://lahden.sibeliustalo.fi/galleria/suuretkuvat/sibeliustalo_metsahalli.jpg ) in lahti , [ this chapel ] ( http://blogit.yle.fi/sites/blogit.yle.fi/files/body_images/kamppi_sisalta.jpg ) , [ another chapel ] ( http://omamaamansikka.fi/files/2014/06/pyh%c3%a4n-henrikin-taidekappeli-4376.jpg ) and [ this helsinki library under construction ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/978/1288573964617.jpg ) . 
  they do n't want reminders of grim realities to the park of the parliament building . 
  it is dickish . 
  the variation of that in finland is that if you see some random person smiling at you in the street , it 's one of three options : a ) the person is drunk b ) the person is crazy c ) the person is foreigner, 
  to be fair , the actual reason for that bench arrangement is to prevent homeless and drunken people from sleeping / passing out on park benches . 
  the park in question is in the very center of helsinki , the front yard of the parliament extension building , so they want to keep it tidy . 
  so it 's a variation of [ this concept ] ( https://sakari2.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/p1080426.jpg ) . 
   so when we go there we must understand and respect their obsolete and discriminatory culture , but when they visit us we must bend too ? 
  no , but when a guy worth 150 billion comes for a visit and you do business with him , you have the option to offend him and dent your business opportunities , or you can cover a statue by american contemporary artists for a moment . 
  this is n't about understanding and respecting , but about money . 
  money , money , money . 
  you want to do business with the rich guy ? 
  please him . 
  so , you are saying money should not be used as a political argument ever if affordability is in conflict with values ? 
  it 's a news story because you get a lot of clicks with news fitting the narrative `` europeans bow before islam and europe will be eurabia soon '' . 
  apparently in some scene of hannibal ( the tv show ) naked buttocks of a body were deemed too obscene , so they covered the buttocks with splashes of blood . 
  then it was good to go !, 
  when the family has wealth of 150 billion , i think it 's clear the reason is n't `` being ashamed '' but simply lick some rich butt in hope of business favors . 
  it 's just political opportunism when money is involved . 
  no , that 's not it . 
  the visual effect is because molecules in our atmosphere are excited by the solar wind and emit light . 
  it 's comparable to glow in the dark toys and such . 
  they absorb energy from light and then re-emit it after a while again as visible light . 
  only with auroras the molecules in the upper atmoshpere absorb energy from electrons and protons instead of light . 
  they are just electrons and protons from the sun hitting the magnetic field of earth . 
  i have never heard that saying in finland . 
  well , there 's nothing official in the national anthem , so what the anthem says is n't an official stance , what i mean . 
  it literally means `` father 's land '' , as in land in the possession of father or the land ones father is from . 
  not `` fatherland '' as in the land being a father . 
  we do n't have an official national anthem . 
  our national anthem is unofficial and purely customary . 
  prime minister !, 
  scandinavia is : 1 . 
  cultural region consisting of denmark , norway and sweden . 
  geographical region consisting of norway , sweden and northern parts of finland . 
  when people talk about scandinavia , they generally talk about it as a cultural region , not the geographical region , so there 's not really need to bring up geography . 
  finland used to be part of sweden until sweden lost a war to russia , and the lost eastern half of sweden was proclaimed as grand duchy of finland , part of the russian empire as an autonomous territory and the predecessor state of modern finland . 
  grand duchy of finland had its own constitution , own currency , own military and border control , own post officials and such . 
  most of the autonomy time was rather good for finland , as the earlier russian emperors tended to be rather tolerant towards finnish autonomy . 
  towards the end of the autonomy , russia started to dismantle the autonomy and tried to [ russificate finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_finland ) , which of course resulted in significant opposition in finland , culminating in the assassination of the russian governor-general responsible for governing finland . 
  that painting was made during the russification era and reflects the political situation of that time : russia trying to rip apart the local laws that govern finland . 
  well , the national personification of finland [ is a she ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/96721202.jpg ) . 
  [ rock and dirt ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/halti#/media/file:haltitunturi.jpg ) . 
  the traditional roofs of medieval churches in finland are so steep that they are rather visible from ground level . 
  one of the churches i linked above even has the roof [ lightly ornamented for decoration ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/15237/normal_u2666.jpg ) because it is visible . 
  black hues do n't really dominate finnish architecture though . 
  it 's common for roofs , but otherwise traditional finnish architecture is either [ natural wood ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/20179/normal_hirsitalo.jpg ) , [ red-white ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c1/7b/03/c17b03f577923075784e4a58b0f31135.jpg ) or [ variety of colors ] ( http://kingofwallpapers.com/porvoo/porvoo-006.jpg ) . 
  yea i know the properties of black and white absorption/reflection have been known for some time , but that 's not the reason tar has been used . 
  it 's to protect the wood from the elements , in a same way wooden boats have been tarred . 
  i pointed out the vaulted ceiling thing to demonstrate that the space under the black roof is not the used interior space , but that the vaults separate it . 
  tarred roofs were used because tarring preserved the wood and made them more water proof . 
  in many medieval finnish churches with tarred roofs , the space under the tarred roof is n't the interior space of the church . 
  you can see the underlying structure [ here ] ( http://static.mtvkatsomo.fi/multimedia/vman/vman-p588/vman-p588781_640x360.jpg ) . 
  the actual interior space is vaulted and separate from the space under the wooden roof . 
  you can see the vaulted ceiling of that church from the inside [ here ] ( http://sakuva.kuvat.fi/kuvat/suomi+2013/fi_130516+suomi_0094+porvoon+tuomiokirkko+sis%c3%a4lt%c3%a4.jpg?img=full ) . 
  compare the shape of helsinki cathedral to the [ st. isaacs cathedral at st. petersburg ] ( http://www.saint-petersburg.com/images/cathedrals/st-isaacs-cathedral/st-isaacs-cathedral-in-st-petersburg.jpg ) . 
  lutheranism is a form of protestantism . 
  i would say it 's not dark because of heat absorption , but because it 's referencing medieval finnish churches with [ wooden tarred roofs ] ( http://api.ning.com/files/dbrwtsp7ycppx0b-yq2d8tcp13gs*v0fm1kg0lritj15ix4jcnkb9kruxefyy4hnrcrxinhmx6a3ni7xhx-pbyxzd8frexso/tyrvnpyhnolavinkirkko.jpg?width=737&amp;height=414 ) . 
  the jugend church is also a focal point of an art installation where a [ blue laser ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8509/8384727762_9977655de5_b.jpg ) spanning a mile or so across the sky ends as a large blue dot on the wall of the church , making the half dome of the church [ look like r2-d2 ] ( http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5537/11762344645_9d26a88c8e.jpg ) . 
  eu in practice has bicameral parliament with the council of ministers being the upper house / senate representing national governments and the eu parliament being the lower house representing the people . 
  it 's adorable also how finnish translates stockholm into * tukholma * and copenhagen into * k\u00f6\u00f6penhamina * . 
   well , define high demand and high prices . 
  higher demand and higher price they originally had . 
  puu-vallila and k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 were originally housing projects for working class , just like kallio was a working class area . 
  both puu-vallila and puu-k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 were under threat of demolition around 70 's but have since gentrified so that they have not been working class areas for decades but their demand and thus prices have raised significantly compared to what the original living costs there were and it gentrified into a middle class area . 
  so , what i 'm saying that there already has happened significant gentrification in the past . 
  that does n't exclude another wave of gentrification happening now . 
  i think most of them are . 
  before being a larger city helsinki was a small swedish speaking fishing town or something . 
  the name of helsinki itself is a translation of helsingfors . 
  edit : if you go to west or east by the coast , the amount of swedish speakers increases . 
  in west there 's kirkkonummi , inkoo and raasepori with more swedish speakers , and in the west there 's sipoo with more swedish speakers . 
  rent support is progressive . 
  if you have work income , the rent support just decreases .
