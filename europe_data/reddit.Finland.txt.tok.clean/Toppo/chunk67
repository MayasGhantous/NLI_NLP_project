  work income does not cause it to be lost completely . 
  a significant portion of kallio still is alcoholics , drug addicts and that kind of people , who manage to live there . 
  it 's still considered to be somewhat bad neighborhood , and you still can regularily see messed up people . 
  just today i saw tons of blood as some drunkard with two bottles of marabello had fallen down the escalators at piritori . 
  helsinki in general is incredibly expensive . 
  500 $ for 12,5 sqm is an extreme , but 500 $ is the common limit for any apartment . 
  that is why the welfare benefits have higher rent support in helsinki than elsewhere in the country . 
  i believe for people living alone the student rent support is about 300 $ , the general rent support is more than that and the sustenance income takes rents up to 650 $ into consideration . 
  kallio has tons of people doing part time jobs and studying and they manage to live here due to rent support . 
  eira , punavuori , ullanlinna , kaartinkaupunki , kaivopuisto and such southern districts are rich areas . 
  kallio is expensive , but in no way for rich people . 
  i 'm not rich , and i live here , been living for four years , and been spending time here even longer since a significant part of my friends live here too . 
  yea , but spring and summer are n't notably cloudy in finland , so there 's a lot of sunshine still . 
   r\u00f6\u00f6peri has already moved on to what i call hipsters . 
  what you posted is n't really hipsters , but rather general women 's fashion . 
  hipsters are more like [ this ] ( http://static-sls.aws.sanomacloud.net/kodinkuvalehti.fi/s3fs-public/blog_images/nelliina/nelliinan-vaatehuone/files/2013/08/s1elok13_0.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://anna.fi/wp-content/uploads/s/f/editor/images/hipsteri2img_6673.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://static-sls.aws.sanomacloud.net/www.menaiset.fi/s3fs-public/styles/medium_main_image_no_upscale/public/wysiwyg_images/full_hipsterit_4_0.jpg?itok=gbfaxva - ) and [ this ] ( http://static-sls.aws.sanomacloud.net/www.menaiset.fi/s3fs-public/styles/medium_main_image_no_upscale/public/wysiwyg_images/full_hipsterit_2_0.jpg?itok=ymgp3pog ) . 
   these are young trendy urbanites from wealthy families who live a very millennial life with the newest gadgets and buzzwords . 
  not all young trendy urbanites are hipsters . 
  hipsters are n't trendy in a classical way as you posted , but have a mash up of pop culture , nostalgia , irony and subcultures . 
  what you posted is more in the lines of style like [ susanna koski ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/5720656/portrait/368/614/8e73b523a2810b006376380ec04bb75c/rm/susanna-koski.jpg ) . 
  modern classic fashion . 
  the only slightly hipster thing is the cap the woman on the right has . 
  if you google `` hipster girl '' [ it is very different from what you posted ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=hipster+girl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewibzbbewdtmahudliwkhuwxaumq_auibygb&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949 ) . 
  also , in a finnish cultural frame , being a hipster is not really associated with being from a wealthy family . 
  finland is so middle class . 
  in addition , they seem to have taken [ the original chairs ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/asuminen/burgetu1809job_an.jpg ) back into use . 
   people should be more open to negative opinions with no need of a huge text to explain why they disliked something . 
  well , the problem is that without an explanation , it is difficult for people to discern is the other person trying to mock you or expressing an opinion based on some critical points . 
  explaining it does n't need a huge text . 
  the guy 's explanation for his opinion was rather short :  yeah , nobody on the streets , feels like abandoned or too cold to stay out . 
  punavuori has been hipster for years too , i 'm not denying that . 
  also bohemians and hipsters have significant overlap , as the very definition of hipsters is so loose that it can easily apply to many bohemians . 
  kallio has for years been in high demand for hipster types . 
  i 've lived in kallio for 4 years and all this time it has been pretty much the same . 
  the only notable difference has been that the word `` hipster '' has seeped into the finnish language and people have learnt to recognize kallio as a hipster place . 
  it seems your morbid obesity and type ii diabetes due to mcfood has impaired your sense of humor !, 
  i think people downvoted him not because of having an opinion , but because people innately expect that when someone says something negative , it 's polite to explain why they think that way . 
  otherwise it comes out easily as mocking . 
  like if someone is asking fashion advice on a look and posts a photo of themselves , there 's two ways to tell the same conclusion : a : * `` you look fat in that dress imho '' * . 
  b : * `` the small horizontal lines on your dress emphasize width and makes you look heavier than you are . 
  '' * when someone disagrees and does n't like something , people perceive it contributing to the discussion when it 's explained why the disagreement and dislike , and perceive it mocking when no explanation is given . 
  the sun shines a lot during the summer . 
  i think in helsinki the sun shines 18 hours a day in midsummer . 
  i thought especially puu-vallila , kumpula and k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 gentrified decades ago . 
  to my understanding the area has been in high demand with high prices for a long time , and the gentrification happened in the 70 's & 80 's . 
  while kallio indeed is a hipster area , it 's not really a place for rich people . 
  kallio is still very populated with students , alcoholics , drug addicts and so on too . 
  if you walk through helsinginkatu on a sunny friday , the bar terraces make it clear a huge part of kallio is average people , with a notable amount of people who evidently have problems managing their lives . 
  vallila-kumpula-k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 is more family oriented middle class place than hipster/rich kid place . 
  as another commenter said , punavuori is more of a rich kid hipster place . 
  kallio has been a hipster district for years . 
  these are outside the city center . 
  somewhat related : [ burger king in a large art nouveau hall of the helsinki railway station ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zemsfgj.jpg ) . 
  well , these are mainly residential areas outside the center , so the people on these streets are mainly the people who live and visit around the residential areas , which is n't enough to create a crowd on the streets . 
  i also did try to place only a few people into the landscape instead of having crowds in the photos . 
  for example the park with the sofa in the last photo had a lot of people , as it 's a very popular park , but i framed just one person into a photo to be the center of attention . 
  likewise the hill on the first photo had a lot of people in the sun , but i framed the photo just to the two girls . 
  as another example of framing is [ this church photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qnqk2ba.jpg ) which was actually taken from [ under this yellow ruotsi sign ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@60.2019567,24.9634208,3a,75y,233.53h,87.71t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slmvxw36zduxfh9ynrc-xuq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , framing the big road and traffic away from the view . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but it 's somewhat along the lines of finnish style , thoug those mansard roofs more commonly are just on [ two sides of the house ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/12399/normal_mansardikattoinen_talo_tuusulassa.jpg ) instead of four as in the first photo . 
  we do n't normally wave flags like that . 
  i had no idea on that date what 's the occasion . 
  i just now googled it was the europe day for eu , celebrating the [ schuman declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schuman_declaration ) . 
  well , it seems i 'm wrong after all and now i 'm embarrassed . 
  let 's pretend this discussion never happened . 
  it 's our secret !, 
   wiktionary also has audio pronunciations . 
  click the play button and listen : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/few#pronunciation  it does not sound like a finnish y. 
  both of those do sound like the finnish y. 
  forget ipa for a moment . 
  for a finnish ear , the english words dew , few and pew are pronounced with * the finnish y * , not like the finnish u ( as the ipa description of / u / is definitely the finnish u ) . 
  it is irrelevant what ipa describes them as , as i was talking about finnish letters and phonemes , not ipa ones . 
  it 's in the end it does not matter if english has the ipa / y / but english most certainly has the finnish y. 
  the ipa alphabet is an approximation , and does not capture all the variations of vowels . 
   finnish total alcohol consumption is higher than other nordic countries ( supported by a report from who ) . 
  but lower than the eu average . 
   those are some pretty lenient definitions on renewables . 
  do you seriously believe those are the * only * definitions of renewables by eu ? 
  that a bureaucratic machine like the eu defines renewables only as they are described in that chart ? 
   ` wood and other solid biofuels ' probably contains fucking charcoal as well . 
  burning charcoal is nothing to be proud of , nor is it something we should strive towards . 
  it 's quite literally the opposite of what we should be doing . 
  from a environmental viewpoint charcoal made from wood no different from burning normal wood . 
  it 's just treated with heat before use . 
  it produces the same amount of co2 . 
   biodiesel and biogasoline are some other feel good terms as well , most of those fuels come hand in hand with massive deforestation . 
  for biodiesels and such to be included in the renewable energy target , they have to meet the sustainability criteria : * to be considered sustainable , biofuels must achieve greenhouse gas savings of at least 35 % in comparison to fossil fuels . 
  this savings requirement rises to 50 % in 2017 . 
  in 2018 , it rises again to 60 % but only for new production plants . 
  ** all life cycle emissions are taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas savings . 
  this includes emissions from cultivation , processing , and transport . 
  ** * ** biofuels can not be grown in areas converted from land with previously high carbon stock such as wetlands or forests . 
  ** * biofuels can not be produced from raw materials obtained from land with high biodiversity such as primary forests or highly biodiverse grasslands . 
  eu does not recognize peat as a renewable fuel , and using it does not add to the renewable energy quota . 
  secondly , the forest mass of finland is increasing , and we are one of the most forested countries in the world . 
  most of our forests are relatively young forests due to our intensive history with pulp production , so as pulp production has decreased , biomass production from wood has increased . 
  so we have n't really `` burned our forests '' any more than we have turned them into toilet paper in the past . 
  well , a finn would easily transcribe the finnish accent `` what '' as `` vat '' . 
  or , as your comment could be with finnish accent and the finnish writing system : aim priti s\u00f6\u00f6r t\u00e4ts ei ts\u00f6\u00f6rm\u00e4n \u00e4ksent . 
  finnis das not h\u00e4\u00e4 ** v ** ei / ** v ** iy / or / dapoljuu / saund , it h\u00e4\u00e4s samting in pit ** v ** iin tous ( labioudentaal approuksimaant ) . 
  [ really ?
