  and eu is a much more diverse place than the us . 
  oil and electricity use are also indicators of your environmental footprint . 
   because that 's the definition of propaganda . 
  cherry picking data to make sweden look better than the us . 
  it 's not cherry picked . 
  the site presents those same data points between any countries you select . 
  they have not been selected keeping sweden and us in mind . 
  also , that data there is very crucial and relevant when comparing countries . 
  the data is not cherry picked . 
  [ the site ] ( https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/ ) presents those comparisons automatically for * any * selected two countries . 
  city can mean two things : 1 . 
  administrative region called `` city '' . 
  like `` city of london '' . 
  a relatively large and dense urban area . 
  espoo , helsinki and vantaa are administratively separate cities . 
  when people talk about where they live and work , they tend to refer to the administrative cities , especially the people within the capital region . 
  as an urban area they are one whole , one city and is commonly treated as such , for example keh\u00e4 iii seen as the limit of the city , and capital region compared as a whole against the rest of the country . 
  lower taxes for rich people . 
  after all , it started as a private community of rich people . 
  at least we did not hitler . 
  yes , the finnish-swedish is a different thing . 
  it 's the mother tongue of swedish speakers here , and they have a different accent in english , whereas those whose mother tongue is only finnish have a different accent from that . 
  edit : where does the term `` moomin swedish '' originate ? 
  do the moomins in swedish dubs speak with a finnish-swedish dialect ? 
  or is it just a reference that it 's a finnish-swedish thing ( tove jansson being a fenno-swede ) ? 
  as a curiosity , [ here 's tove jansson speaking ] ( https://youtu.be/d1_iedjegzq?t=1m53s ) . 
  i have no idea how that sounds to swedes . 
  though it 's worth noting that the mother of tove was swedish . 
  what is quiet singy ? 
  a few english teachers of mine ( native english speakers ) have said finnish so flat that finns seem like slow dumb retards when speaking english . 
  to my ear it is at least . 
  not as much as swedish or norwegian , but still . 
  i 'm not that familiar with icelandic , but iirc it has preserved the monotone of old norse , whereas danish , swedish and especially norwegian have evolved this singy songy tone . 
  finnish also has a flat tone for unrelated reasons , so when speaking english finns too have a rather flat tone as the accent . 
  i noted that for example [ bj\u00f6rk in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75wfthpow8y ) has an accent which strongly resembles finnish accent to my ear . 
  [ edit : compare to the [ strong accent of our former prime minster ] ( https://youtu.be/gxsqzbhalfw?t=9s ) ] incidentally the dialect of swedish spoken in finland also ( to my knowledge ) has somewhat preserved the flat tone of old norse , and some rural swedish in finland preserves some features which only remain in icelandic too . 
   the quintessence of soviet commie block nightmare . 
  [ norilsk in siberia ] ( http://abload.de/img/f29239d04a6fe278fde634vkuq.jpg ) would like to have a word with you . 
  that 's a parody of an [ actual ad for a finnish hardware store in sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15evaadnq4i ) . 
   my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 second-hand embarrassment . 
  the first time i was in denmark we went trough the country with a train . 
  when the ticket inspector came and greeted us with '' * sgyygh flgorgh fglyoyherg * '' and kept talking to us we could hardly contain our laughter . 
  such a fascinating language !, 
  there 's also [ this finnish skit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_gtamzdloc ) about a danish biologist skiigge b\u00f6y on an excursion to finnish nature . 
  yea it 's not really architectonic . 
  all the stations are built the same way with the same basic structure ( 90 meter platform with exits on both sides ) and it 's just decoration and lights to make them different from each other . 
  there has been shorter trains before . 
  the [ blue lights ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jlvvofexxwy/t4qlz2ub0wi/aaaaaaaaacy/jiba8oy48ti/s1600/_dsc9621ps.jpg ) have for a long time marked where the short trains stop on the platforms . 
  so that 's why it 's not entirely clear are all the trains short now , as there has been shorter trains before . 
  i was especially thinkin of rogue one . 
  it 's because some of the deleted scenes [ were shot in a subway station in london ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4x42qmy.jpg ) . 
  they calculated that with the shorter interval of trains , there actually will be more carriages per hour than before . 
  iirc they already switched to shorter trains , and i have n't noticed any change . 
  to my knowledge l\u00e4nsimetro will be late less than a year . 
  it was scheduled to open in august 2016 , but it has been postponed several times and it seems it will be fully running in june 2017 . 
  only recently the construction became a joke , and the delay of 10 months still is nothing compared to olkiluoto 3 , which actually was supposed to open in 2009 and probably will be * 9 years late * , whereas the delays of l\u00e4nsimetro are rather recent , from last summer . 
  also slightly '' * evil corporation with secret underground research facilities focusing on deadly viral mutagens * '', 
  most of helsinki residents have originated from outside helsinki for over 150 years . 
  so the people who are n't drunks move to helsinki and become cunts . 
  no , it 's decades old . 
  every language has phrases like that . 
  think of `` lead lies '' in english . 
  what does it mean ? 
  to be fair , most of inner helsinki still is rather old . 
  architecture [ like this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7z6gwtzkh4g/vq51ohvdfei/aaaaaaaasde/shsfv9psjk0/s1600/img_0097x.jpg ) is still rather common . 
  to my knowledge helsinki still has a notable amount of art nouveau buildings by international standards . 
  i know that some old buildings were demolished because they realized it 's more expensive to modernize them than to build a new one . 
  like some buildings did n't have indoor toilets , they had crappy heating , small rooms and spaces and such . 
  iirc reason for protecting it is n't that it 's somehow pretty , but because it is an example of a ( failed ) utopia , an example of the building mania of the 60 's and 70 's . 
  so in a way it 's purpose is to remind `` look what you did '' . 
  i do n't know anything about the situation in india , but to me that sounds doubtful as india has over a billion people and to my knowledge has no social safety nets comparable to finland . 
  finland on the other hand already has minimum income and only 5,5 million people . 
  it 's a test . 
  they realistically can not test it with all finns without any previous tests of ubi . 
   i wouldnt say im similar to the russian rebels in ukraine . 
  similar * rhetorics * , not similar actions . 
   i have both swedish and finnsh citizenship and i lived in \u00c5land during the years that really shape you as a person so i identify as an \u00c5lander bc thats were i grew up and have relatives . 
  then why did you say stockholm is a `` foreign '' capital if it is the capital of your country of birth , of which you have citizenship of and where you have lived most of your life ? 
   i dont think you should compare me to perus or sd . 
  that is very unfair , im fine with finland being multiethnic but i just dont see any reason for \u00c5land being a part of finland . 
  your talk about how '' ** if we had our own people defending us and representing us ** '' and '' ** obviously you want people with your language and culture representing you . 
  nations are built upon that ** '' has strong undertones against a multi-ethnic society . 
   finns would stop having to accommodate \u00c5land in their politics and \u00c5landers would get more influence over their island . 
  were \u00c5land part of sweden , it probably would have less influence in sweden as * it would n't be a minority language in sweden anymore and would have no need for autonomy to protect the language * . 
   \u00c5land was before 1809 part of `` swedish '' sweden , finland was distinct in the sense it was treated as one of swedens 4 `` lands '' alongside g\u00f6taland , svealand and norrland . 
  [ half of finland was part of norrland ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/norrland#/media/file:map_swedish_lands.png ) . 
  if we follow your logic , then all of norrland should belong to finland or to sweden . 
  so , which is it ? 
  are finnish lapland and northern ostrobothnia parts of `` swedish sweden '' or should the modern swedish norrland be a part of finland ? 
   so swedish speakers in finland speak distinct dialects that are unique to finland whilst \u00c5landers speak a dialect related to those spoken in svealand , sweden . 
  all swedish dialects are somewhat related to other dialects . 
  \u00c5land swedish has features shared with both swedish in sweden and in finland . 
  likewise the ostrobothnian swedish is related to westrobothnian swedish dialects . 
   as i said the most important thing for \u00c5landers is autonomy but if presented the option of retaining their current status but inside sweden instead most \u00c5landers would prefer that . 
  asi i said , i have never seen opinion studies which support your claim , only ones that have the opposing view from \u00c5landers , that they prefer to be autonomous part of finland . 
   when walking in the foreign capital stockholm i can speak my mother tongue and feel at home , whilst in my own capital helsinki i usually use english and treated like a foreigner . 
  english is not an official language of finland in any form . 
  if you speak english in finland , of course people treat you like a foreigner . 
  what did you expect ? 
  also in your [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6q02ka/wonderful_%c3%a5land_i_grew_up_on_this_beautiful/dkw24sd/ ) you said this :  i was born in sweden to a swedish mom and a \u00c5landic dad .
