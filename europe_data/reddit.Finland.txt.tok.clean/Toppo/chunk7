   i live in the second biggest city in finland and get twice as much space in a city center apartment for the same price . 
  but i guess that from some remote countryside you would get a huge amount of more space compared to your current apartment for the same price . 
  that does not make your home a bad place , does it ? 
  to my knowledge the energy efficiency in sweden has reduced their energy consumption . 
  and the ban of incandescent light bulbs is not an isolated decision that was expected to have a major effect . 
  it is a part of large variety of restrictions on all kinds of electricity appliances . 
  so while restriction on one individual product might not yield large results , the restriction on large variety of products ends up having results . 
  so it 's not that `` light bulb ban did not really reduce energy consumption significantly '' . 
  it 's what incandescent bulb ban + washing machine regulations + television regulations + kitchen appliance regulations + vacuum cleaner regulations + phone charger regulations + many more regulations affect as a whole . 
  hahah , so much this . 
  similarly in finland there 's always news `` eu bans this '' and `` eu did that '' , and when someone did a bit research on all those things , majority of those things did n't come from the eu , but originated from the * finnish parliament * , which interpreted eu directives in the most strictest imaginable way , in ways the eu did not mean . 
  oh come on . 
  tons of eu citizens have no idea on how the eu works , and that 's part of the reason the parliamentary elections have such a low turnout . 
   in terms of jurisdiction , the ep co-legislates with the council of the eu on most matters , though only the commission can initiate legislation . 
  the simplest and clearest way i 've heard this explained is that the eu has a bicameral legislative body , where parliament is the lower house and council of eu is the upper house , and the commission is the executive government with the president of the commission , ( jose manuel barroso ) being the prime minister . 
  btw i think for this reason the council of ministers/council of eu should be renamed * the senate of the european union * . 
  i was kind of surprised that bavarian mountains & hills were n't there . 
  but , having visited old german beech forest , i 'm not surprised they are on the list . 
  they were very pretty , and the trees were just hugely tall . 
  switzerland stole all the alpine bits :(, 
  it would n't ruin the series , it would only take time , and i 'm a bit lazy now :d, 
  i used that in the set of cultural heritage sites , but i missed armenia , as it 's not on that list , so when making this one i used the unesco site directly , which also has nicer information of the places . 
  argh , it 's an annoying feature of imgur . 
  i used the same unesco logo as the first image in both natural/cultural image sets . 
  i thought that the descriptions you put to the image are saved on the album , and dependent on the album where the image is shown . 
  so when i re-used the image in the natural sites album , i wrote new descriptions for the image . 
  but imgur then mirrors this description to the other folder which uses the same image . 
  i think the kaali craters should be , as they are so fresh impact craters . 
  this list is about natural sites . 
  the skellings was listed in the previous list i made about cultural heritage sites : http://imgur.com/a/311uz, 
  oh thanks for noticing !, 
  it was in the unesco site list but i somehow missed . 
  i 'll add it !, 
  sometimes i miss sites and mix names and stuff as doing these is somewhat mechanic and i get messed up easily . 
  while unesco lists it as purely cultural , seeing their reasons for including it and the site itself it also saw it valid that it is also natural , so i added it to the list with a note on unesco classification . 
  * source is [ unesco site ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/ ) . 
  i added it to the info there . 
  * as said in the info on the imgur page , the list has ** all ** european natural heritage sites . 
  some countries have more than one ( like spain ) , some have none ( like estonia ) . 
  * added the name of the croatian site . 
  it was accidentally left out . 
  thanks for noting !, 
  edit : some sites are left out , like russian ones far away from europe , close to china and the pacific ocean , and overseas territories of france and the uk in the pacific , indian and southern atlantic ocean . 
  how about the netherlands and belgium ? 
  there are enclaves of belgian territory inside netherlands , and inside the belgian enclaves are enclaves of dutch territory : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg now that 's seriously a fucked up mess . 
   it 's not a case of `` i do n't like their opinions '' it 's a case of these people are party to crimes against humanity and have no business being around innocent people . 
  are you saying you currently have no laws in the uk that sanction crimes against humanity and other things the isis-fighters are doing ? 
  i mean , do n't you have * prisons * ? 
   the only human rights they deserve are public trial and a lifetime alone in 6 by 8 foot concrete room . 
  how far would you be willing to go to strip human rights of evil people ? 
  would you say that ~ ~ torture ~ ~ * enhanced coercive interrogation technique * should be the tool of every government when they face `` evil people '' ? 
  modern comparison : because the us has not declared war , and the war on terror is a `` military operation '' instead of war , the guantanamo bay prisoners are `` enemy combatants '' instead of prisoners of war . 
  and because they are not prisoners of war , the international law concerning prisoners of war does not apply to them . 
  the sort of same thing is if you strip someone of their only citizenship . 
  international laws that apply to citizens of countries suddenly do not apply to them . 
  these people have no nation they can seek help from if they are mistreated . 
  i never have thought of it making fun of only europeans , as the whole premise of the movie is built on the ridiculous exaggerated ignorance of americans about europe . 
  it not only laughs at europe , but also to stereotypically american ignorance . 
  earlier comment seems to gotten buried . 
  just to inform everyone : iltalehti is sensationalist yellow press . 
  they do shit news and clickbaits . 
  another day they had a headline `` familiar tropical virus found in swimming beaches !, 
  '' , which of course evoked ebola , but was n't . 
  then they have these `` top 5 things men * really * enjoy in a relationship : 3 . 
  sex '' or `` this random celebrity ate three liters of strawberries '' . 
  is n't this a reference to [ this quiz show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cey35bbwxls ) ? 
  no reasons for downvotes if it is !, 
  and to me it 's aesthetically pleasing , because you can just make a rough right angle for the borders when all baltic countries are included : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qep5jvn.jpg ),

   unfortunately that tends to fuel nationalism and the support for expansion . 
  to my understanding stuff like this can also fuel civil unrest against the ruling government . 
  afaik the arab spring was fueled by food shortages which then fueled the distrust on the actions of the government . 
  transparency international is headquartered in germany , where it was founded . 
  secondly whether it is corruption , environmental issues or human rights abuses , the world has more of those than any ngo can deal with . 
  therefore the existence of corruption , environmental issues or human right abuses in some country is not a proof that that country is bribing ngo 's to ignore them . 
  there 's just too much happening . 
   just because there 's an international agency funded mostly by the us he said foreign funded ngo 's . 
  that includes transparency international , world wildlife fund , human rights watch and so on . 
  those are not us funded . 
  that would be selfish . 
  and besides , the sanctions on finland targeted dairy products , which are n't that easy to store . 
  i ca n't just pile up 10 kilos of cheese and hope it does not spoil . 
  i was actually thinking of buying a shitload of apples from poland and making jams and cider and drying them and stuff . 
  the china one is n't that much of a stretch if you look at the athos monasteries from another angle : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/athos_13.jpg http://poseidon.csd.auth.gr/athos/icon19.jpg, 
  well , it does look more european than american to me . 
  they do look rather old , and definitely not what comes to my mind about america . 
  brick buildings are rather rare in european old cities , but what comes to mind is [ amsterdam ] ( http://www.kameramsterdam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/amsterdam-staat-verhuur-aan-toeristen-toe.jpg ) . 
  oh god what a language !, 
  what it actually is is an old landfill in eastern helsinki that was covered and landscaped . 
   because one is just that , domestic . 
  and that is better why ? 
   correct because foreign ngo 's are by their nature an outlet for foreign interests and a form of cultural imperialism . 
  so to you human righs , democracy and environmental issues are foreign interest ? 
  and how is it cultural imperialism , if no one is forced on anything ? 
   are you perhaps in favor of russian ngo 's operating in your country supporting separatism , orthodox conservatism and similar views ?
