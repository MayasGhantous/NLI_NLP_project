  we moved back to \u00c5land when i was 5 ( 1993 ) . 
  i remained there until 2005 when i went to study in uppsala and later stayed in sweden bc of the few jobs on \u00c5land . 
  if you have a swedish mother and for the first 5 years of your life you lived in sweden , i assume you have a swedish citizenship . 
  thus stockholm is not a foreign capital for you , but capital of your other home country . 
  likewise if you have lived most of your life in sweden ( 12 years in \u00c5land vs. 17 years in sweden ) and have n't lived in finland for the past 12 years , it 's hardly surprising you feel more home in stockholm than in helsinki , where you seemingly have never lived in for any significant time . 
   \u00c5land is so often overlooked by finnish politicians , if we had our own people defending us and representing us i think \u00c5lands interests would be better served . 
  \u00c5land is `` overlooked '' * because \u00c5land has strong autonomy * . 
  do you think the politicians of mainland finland should make more decisions concerning \u00c5land instead of letting \u00c5landers have the autonomy they currently have ? 
  also , your talk of `` our own people '' is the very kind of divide that you complain exists in finland . 
  imagine if russians in estonia thought like you ? 
  that '' * if we had our own people defending us and representing us i think estonian russians interests would be better served * '' . 
  the rhetoric you are using is the exact same rhetoric which was used to justify invading ukraine . 
  you basically are a swedish version of perus . 
  you were born in sweden , have lived most of your life in sweden , not in finland , and your mother is swedish , probably you have swedish citizenship , and then living in a foreign country to finland you start talking about `` our people '' and use that as a justification why parts of finland should belong to sweden . 
   i absolutely agree sweden treated its finnish speakers alot worse than finland treats its swedish speakers . 
  i fixed the link . 
  the link considered what * is happening now * . 
  sweden still treats finnish speakers worse than finland treats swedish speakers . 
   finnish is atleast recognized now in sweden , i have also not heard of any outright hostility towards finnish speakers lately like swedish speakers are being targeted in finland . 
  that 's because you are not a finnish speaker . 
  the news i posted concerned finnish speakers in sweden . 
   perus still lives btw . 
  yes , but you claimed that '' * even though perus recently collapsed their influence and supporters is still left * '' . 
  that is not true . 
  their influence and support has greatly diminished . 
   im proudly swedish speaking , prodly \u00c5lander and european who is fine with being part of finland but would prefer being under sweden with my fellow swedish speakers . 
  and just like perus and sverigedemokraterna , you are a proud nationalist who thinks nations should be made of `` our own people '' instead of letting nations be ethnically diverse . 
  and oh yeah , might i remind you that [ sverigedemokraterna has a much greater support than perus has ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anti-immigrant-sweden-democrats-yougov-poll-first-most-popular-refugee-a7649506.html ) . 
  that 's swedish nationalism for you . 
   before 1809 \u00c5land was considered part of uppland but was administered by \u00c5bo och bj\u00f6rneborg county . 
  before 1809 whole finland was considered part of sweden . 
  that 's over 200 years ago and with your line of thinking , entire finland should be part of sweden . 
  or with your line of thinking , russia could claim finland should be part of russia . 
   so \u00c5land was not viewed as part of \u00d6stra rikshalvan ( finland ) \u00c5landers at that time were just regular swedes whilst finlandswedes in finland had their own identity . 
  no , they did n't . 
  idea of ethnic identity is a rather modern phenomena and became popular in the later 19th century , after sweden lost finland . 
  before that normal people did n't really have the identity of `` swedish '' or `` finnish '' or `` swedish-speaking finn '' . 
   most \u00c5landers `` want '' to be autonomous within sweden but its just not an important issue . 
  i only remember seeing opinion studies that most \u00c5landers want to be autonomous but within finland , ( what i 've heard from \u00c5landers it 's because they do not trust they would have autonomy under sweden , as there is no reason to grant autonomy to a territory with the same language ) . 
   obviously you want people with your language and culture representing you . 
  nations are built upon that . 
  i dont think finns would be very happy with russia defending and representing finland . 
  russia has a drastically different culture from finland , whereas due to the shared 600 years finland and sweden have a very similar culture and way of life and society , so the comparison does not really merit on the culture part . 
  also language is not really that crucial . 
  there are tons of multilingual nations , like sweden , where finland is one of the largest minority languages , but they really do n't have a problem of being represented in swedish language . 
   even though perus recently collapsed their influence and supporters is still left . 
  their support has collapsed and their influence diminished greatly . 
  they are no longer in the government , and those splinters remaining in the government have much less power there as the other government parties can always threat to take swedish people 's party and christian democrats to the government instead of the splinters . 
  in the last gallup the splinter group had less than one percent support . 
   the finnish society is turning more and more against its swedish minority . 
  and your ideology has the consequence that [ swedish society is turning more and more against it 's finnish speaking minority . 
  ] ( https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/activists_protest_at_alleged_restrictions_on_use_of_finnish_in_sweden/9688773 ) that 's the result of the `` nations are built upon that '' - ideology getting more foothold in sweden . 
  that 's what you want . 
   because we speak swedish and have swedish culture . 
  so do tons of swedish speaking finns . 
  swedish language and culture is not restricted to sweden . 
  finland has been part of sweden longer than the viking age lasted , and swedish speaking finns have swedish cultural stuff like maypoles in midsummer and lucia-festivities and fikas and such . 
   we want swedes to defend us and represent us internationally . 
  * you * want , most of \u00c5landers do not want . 
  also why do * you * want sweden to represent and defend \u00c5land instead of finland ? 
   it also is annoying on a map to see \u00e5land part of finland and having to explain to foreigners that its swedish speaking . 
  that 's not a good reason . 
  i mean , imagine if russians started wishing russian speaking areas of estonia should be joined with russia because it is annoying to explain that estonia has russian speakers . 
  or imagine that if canadians started demanding quebec should be a part of france because it is annoying that people do n't know canada has french speaking population . 
   sadly since perus got into power i feel that respect is lost . 
  perus has proposed abolishing official swedish and militarizing \u00c5land . 
  doing so would 100 % certainly make the \u00e5landers vote for independence or maybe sweden . 
  you do know that perus imploded ? 
  the party as it used to be no longer exists . 
  those in government cabinet are no longer part of the party , but started a splinter group which seems to have shitty numbers in gallups . 
  likewise the official perus is no longer in the government , and their popularity is also a lot smaller than in the elections . 
  combined they have about 8 % support in gallups . 
   that presumably gave the representatives the illusion that \u00c5land was closer to finland and that its part of finnish archipelago . 
  well , if you consider the finnish archipelago east of \u00c5land being `` mainland '' finland , then \u00c5land is closer to finland . 
  the fact that \u00c5land is part of the same continuous archipelago [ is obvious . 
  why under sweden instead of under finland ? 
  probably all of them are also dead by now . 
  if you look at the surrounding streets , [ the building strongly resembles the neighboring brick buildings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r07kskd.jpg ) . 
  and [ another view ] ( http://www.vastavalo.net/albums/userpics/11816/normal_20120501aria104.jpg ) . 
  and [ here 's a street view ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.1711889,24.9468938,3a,75y,65.53h,105.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sordjhfpyfnvbpjwjbfv90g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
   the layout changes required are so massive that it 's cheaper and easier to tear the old building down instead of modifying it . 
  actually no with the library . 
  the shopping center was n't completely torn down , but the basic support structure of most of the building floors was used in the library and a new facade was built . 
  see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nahm9/london_tube_staff_ditch_ladies_and_gentlemen_for/dk8a0co/ ) . 
   the question is `` why should they ? '' . 
  for the same reasons straight people should . 
  so why should straight people be allowed to adopt children ? 
   everyone has the same right : marry a member of the opposite sex and have children or adopt so , you would be totally fine if opposite-sex marriages were banned * only gay marriage was legal * ? 
  because straight people still would have equal rights to marry , right ? 
  you 'd have to accept that as a valid solution , or either acknowledge that everyone does not have the same rights . 
  which is it ? 
   forced genderlessness where people pretend gender differences do n't exist . 
  how is this forced genderlesness ? 
  finnish language has no gender pronouns whatsoever , and no one has claimed it 's because finnish people pretend or think that genders do n't exist . 
  it 's a ridiculous claim that `` forcing genderlesness '' would be * the only reason * to use gender neutral language . 
  so finnish language alone proves that gender neutrality in some situations is not fixed to the idea of `` forced genderlessness where people pretend gender differences do n't exist '' . 
  finnish language proves that it is possible to have gender neutral features in language without the reasons you claim . 
  i mean , in finnish language the gender neutral pronouns are sometimes just very handy . 
  for example before trump was elected , and it was not known will the next president be a woman or a man , one can not just write `` the next president has to make tough choices , as * he * faces ... '' as it would have excluded clinton and . 
  without genderless pronouns you then have to go around the pronoun and write like `` the next president has to make tough choices , as * he or she * / * the next president * / * the person * faces ... '' in finnish it 's simpler , you can just use a gender neutral pronoun to deal with the uncertainty of the gender of the next president .
