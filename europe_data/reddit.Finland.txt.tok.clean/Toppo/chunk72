  perhaps new in the way it is currently pushed , but the pronoun itself exists and is used in that way , so my point still stands : ** there is no need to invent a new one , since `` they '' already exists . 
  ** your sources also confirm this :  using them , they , or their is a way to avoid making an assumption of gender as there is no gender explicit in these pronouns . 
  your source also says : '' * using them , they , or their is a way to avoid making an assumption of gender as there is no gender explicit in these pronouns . 
  * '' this proves [ my point  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nahm9/london_tube_staff_ditch_ladies_and_gentlemen_for/dk88b5j/ ) ** there is no need to invent a new gender neutral third person singular pronoun for english , as on exists already ** . 
  true , but that does n't really take away from the argument lgbt advocates have for this change . 
   all of whom are ladies and gentlemen ? 
  so , your premise is that gender identity should be fixed to biological sex ? 
  so you also refuse to treat trans women as women , and insist calling them men , since that 's the biology they were born with ? 
  just to want to know it clear what you stand for . 
  oh , how about that sexual orientation should be fixed to biological sex ? 
  do you believe that also to be true , and that homosexuality is a mental illness or a delusion ? 
  because you seem to claim that the experiences people have concerning sex and gender are strictly bound to how the vast majority of a specified sex experiences them . 
   also , `` special treatment '' ? 
  in a mode of adressing ? 
  the person above me just claimed that the respectful all inclusive mode of addressing is actually special treatment :  [ respect \u2260 special treatment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nahm9/london_tube_staff_ditch_ladies_and_gentlemen_for/dk8548g/ ), 
  you said that `` people were forced to use plurals '' , as if `` they '' in my example were a plural . 
  but it is not . 
  much like the english word `` you '' is * both * second person plural * and singular * , and `` you should leave '' can refer to both an individual person and a group of persons , the english word `` they '' operates both as a third person plural * and as a third person singular * , and can refer both to an individual and a group . 
  it 's called singular they and is a part of english grammar . 
  sure , but that 's not the scenario i presented . 
  edit : for clarity , i asked you to imagine a certain scenario , and how would straight men feel in that situation . 
  the point was to illustrate the position gender minorities have when they are ignored and treated as non-existent . 
  yes . 
  if you have no more pressing issues to comment about than this one , we truly have reached elysium . 
  since things obviously are black and white . 
  if you are a straight male , imagine if every public announcement treated all men as gay men , they would refer to '' * ladies and gay gentlemen * '' , all the toilets would be labeled as '' * women * '' or '' * gay men * '' , and straight men would be completely ignored from existence . 
  from my [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nahm9/london_tube_staff_ditch_ladies_and_gentlemen_for/dk85rd7/ ) : as a gay guy i understand this decision completely . 
  for understandable reasons it is rather common that when talking about men , people and even institutions talk with the tone '' * she is the dream woman of every man * '' and '' * every guy knows the feeling when a girl _____ * '' . 
  i 'm not triggered by it at all , but hearing that a lot is annoying , as it makes gay guys completely invisible , like we do n't exist , that we should not be included to the group of `` every man '' . 
  making slight adjustments like london tube did does n't produce harm to anyone , and makes it less annoying . 
  and iirc correctly here in helsinki the automatic public transport announcements always say just `` dear passengers '' and no one has complained about how they fail to mention genders . 
  saying `` dear passengers '' or `` hello everyone '' is * literally the opposite of special treatment , as it does not single out some group of people * . 
  `` ladies and gentlemen '' however does single out groups of people to be acknowledged and ignore the minorities . 
  imagine ( assuming you are a straight male ) if your daily commuting would have announcement `` ladies and gay gentlemen '' . 
  straight men would be ignored . 
  would you then think that it 's special treatment if straight men wish the announcement to be '' * dear passengers * '' or '' * good day everyone * '' ? 
  workers have to follow the policies set by employers ? 
  oh the horror !, 
  we truly are living in a nightmare . 
   they are , but the point is that nothing does ever appeal to this community . 
  it could also be argued that nothing does ever appeal to people like you . 
  every hope gender minorities have for being acknowledged is too much . 
   gay rights of the early 2010s gave birth to the gender-neutral pushes we see today , which was exactly the kind of `` slippery slope '' anti-gay marriage people were saying would happen . 
  this kind of gender neutral pushes have been part of lgbt rights for a ages . 
  comparable slippery slope would be '' * if we are going to decriminalize homosexual acts , it will lead to gay people requiring the right to marry . 
  * '' so what ? 
  sure , for them the idea of gay marriage is horrible , and they oppose that . 
  but for lgbt movement it was n't some hidden agenda or something the lgbt movement has denied , just like the push for acknowledging gender minorities . 
  only now it has become more talked about , as rights of gender minorities have become more tolerated and visible . 
  this however in no way proves the slippery slope presented by u/pokymonn has merit , as he is talking about categorically very different things . 
  he is not talking about gender minorities at all , but about some otherkin thing which are more like an online subculture and do n't have substantial connection to lgbt rights movement . 
   i mean i 'm 100 % for gay rights , but it is true that the more you indulge this line of thinking the further they push and nothing ever seems good enough . 
  but what if the thing you deem is `` good enough '' actually is n't good enough , and you do n't realize it because it does not affect your life ? 
  like imagine someone saying '' * if we decriminalize homosexual acts , they will require the right to marry . 
  the more you indulge this line of thinking , the further they push and nothing ever seems good enough * '' ? 
   that 's this group of people who felt so strongly about it they had to write in or other wise make their discomfort known . 
  about something trivial . 
  thereby creating unnecesarry drama . 
  so if someone let 's others know about some thing they 'd prefer to be changed , it 's creating unnecessary drama ? 
  is that how you define unnecessary drama leading to terrible and shit life ? 
  if we follow that definition , every small thing you wish to be changed and note about becomes unnecessary drama . 
  say you are annoyed that the bus drivers on your daily communing route are very rude . 
  letting the company know about this is creating unnecessary drama . 
  so if you make a complaint about rude bus drivers , you obviously have a terrible life , as you can not even accept bus drivers ( who you have very little contact with to begin with ) being rude . 
  you 're going to have a shit life . 
  and that 's the point of gender neutral pronouns . 
  you . 
  singular or plural pronoun ? 
  what about them ? 
   there are also people who do n't identify as humans or they identify as animals . 
  but non-binary do n't claim to identify something non-human , so that 's completely irrelevant to this subject . 
  non-binary do n't make a positive claim that they are something beyond human . 
  it 's just that their gender identity is comparable to what bisexuality and asexuality is to sexual identity : a mix of male and female traits or lack of those . 
   i 'm not ready to tolerate untreated mental illness , even less prone to consider it normal . 
  if a person does not suffer from non-binary identity , why is it an illness ? 
   i know that , it 's called hermaphroditism . 
  which is a clinical conditions , old as the world and rather unfortunate , but it is not `` normal '' . 
  it 's not called hermaphroditism . 
  hermaphrodites are organisms which have fully functional reproductive organs of both sexes . 
  like most flowers and snails . 
  there have never been cases of human beings with functional reproductive organs of ~ ~ the same sex ~ ~ both sexes , so there have never been hermaphrodites with humans . 
  secondly , just because intersex condition is a clinical condition , * is that a reason to ignore them ? 
  *   there are some people who innately identify with the opposite sex ( i believe the term is transsexual )  irrelevant in this case , they will still identify themself either as a lady or as a gentleman . 
  if you are going to quote me , ** at least quote the entire context ** : there are some people who innately identify with the opposite sex ( i believe the term is transsexual ) , ** but then there are people whose innate gender identity does not neatly follow the label man/woman , or people who completely lack the experience of gender identity . 
  ** the relevant point of the sentence is the bold one . 
   there 's no proof of it whatsoever , though . 
  uh , then in the very next sentence you yourself argue that differences in gender identity can be detected in brain scans . 
  * that 's exactly proof that gender identity is not bound to your anatomical sex , but is a phenomena born out of variations in how brains function . 
  *  since gender is the behaviour associated with sex , and since there are only two sexes , there can only be two genders . 
  that 's like saying '' * since sexuality is the behavior associated with sex , and since there are only two sexes , there can be only two sexual orientations * '' . 
  in other words with your logic you should claim bisexuals have a mental illness or they are larping . 
  are you willing to make that claim ? 
  well , i beg you to give attention to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nahm9/london_tube_staff_ditch_ladies_and_gentlemen_for/dk85rd7/ ) . 
  obviously as a good person you will give attention to that , 
  gender * identity * is a different thing from physical sex . 
  just like we have sexual orientation , * the ability to innately differentiate sexes and feel attraction based on this differentiation * , humans also have a gender identity , * the ability to innately differentiate sexes and identify with based on this differentiation * . 
  but just like with sexuality there are not just heterosexuals and homosexuals , but also bisexuals and asexuals , with human gender identity the identity does not always follow the physical sex neatly ( just like sexual orientation does not follow what is expected frome the physical sex ) . 
  this leaves some people to have blurred gender identity , mix of both ( comparable to bisexuals as sexual orientation ) , or even lack the experience of gender identity ( comparable to asexuals as sexual orientation ) . 
   but ... but the point is another , the point is that changing a decades old tradition because `` we want everyone to feel welcome on our transport network '' is ... well , is retarded . 
  that is a really bad argument , `` tradition '' .
