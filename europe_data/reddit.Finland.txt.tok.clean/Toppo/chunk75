  ** these prove your claim about homosexuals being infertile is simply false . 
  **  and since one of the basic aims of the marriage is to create a stable environment for having and raising children it 's naturally heterosexual institution and legal privilege . 
  that is not the case . 
  if that would be the case , marriage would be forbidden from women over 50 , from other sterile people and from heterosexual couples who decide to adopt instead of having biological children , or decide not to have children at all . 
  ** the fact their marriages are not forbidden , proves your claim about the necessities of marriage to be false . 
  **  what two guys living together have in common with marriage ? 
  pretty much nothing um , how about * love * ? 
  you are so focused on fertile males breeding females that you have completely missed the fact that in the west the * raison d'\u00eatre * of marriage * is love * . 
  but you do n't care about love . 
  ** you are so conservative that to you marriage is just about man shooting his semen inside a woman , instead of them loving each other and wanting to commit to each other ** . 
   i know people of the west tend to believe their culture is supreme and can be enforced on `` less civilized '' people , but not everyone accepts this cultural aggression and considers it a `` progress '' ... says someone who defends the right of muhammad to have sex with a 9-year old girl for the sake of traditional marriage . 
  apparently you evade answering these questions , because you are afraid answering these questions would reveal the weakness of your arguments . 
  but let 's try again : do you support banning marriage from women over 50 , from sterile people ? 
  do you support annulling marriages where the couple adopts instead of having biological children ? 
  ** because marriage of these people does not give life to the next generation , so marriage is not for them . 
  this is your logic , not mine . 
  do you stand by your logic and support forbidding marriage from these people ? 
  ** also : ** do you defend the social norm and tradition which led muhammad to have sex with a 9 year old girl ? 
  yes or no ? 
   outside those specific competencies the eu is a toothless tiger particularly in foreign affairs . 
  that 's mainly because that 's the way the member states want it . 
  they do n't want eu foreign policy to supersede their own national foreign policy . 
   because there 's only one acceptable way to approach the issue of homosexuality and all the others are `` homophobic '' . 
  if you say homosexuals should not have equal treatment before the law and use a strongly loaded term `` unnatural '' to describe a natural phenomena like homosexuality , how is that not homophobic ? 
  ** you are literally against equal human rights for lgbt people ** so what exactly makes you not homophobic ? 
   plus i 've never said that homosexuals should n't have equal human rights equal treatment before the law is a human right . 
  banning marriage from one group of adults is unequal treatment before the law . 
  by saying gay people should not marry , you are saying they do n't deserve equal treatment before the law . 
  you are saying they do n't deserve equal human rights . 
   but that marriage is not for them , since it naturally serves the aim of giving life to next generation . 
  so you support banning marriage from women over 50 ? 
  you support banning marriage from sterile people ? 
  you support annulling marriages where the couple adopts instead of having biological children ? 
  because marriage of these people does not give life to the next generation , so marriage is not for them . 
  ** this is your logic , not mine . 
  do you stand by your logic ? 
  **  nor that homosexuals are unnatural ( homosexuality is , not a homosexual person ) . 
  ** how can something which occurs naturally be unnatural ? 
  **  nor that homosexuals are `` bad parents '' - it 's just that having mum and dad is the best for kids ' development . 
  firstly , ** you questioned the right of lgbt people to have children ** . 
  why would you question it , if you do n't consider them to be bad parents ? 
  ... and you just completely ignored this : '' * [ scientific research consistently shows that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents , and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents . 
  major associations of mental health professionals in the u.s. , canada , and australia have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_parenting ) * '' do realize that you are not some neutral bystander who is making neutral evaluations of the situation . 
  ** you are one of those people actively opposing lgbt rights . 
  ** edit : oh and yea , ** do you defend the social norm and tradition which led muhammad to have sex with a 9 year old girl ? 
  ** and if you are trying to argue that natural = good and unnatural = bad , then ** are you for rape , cancer and infant mortality and against reddit , antibiotics and eyeglasses ? 
  ** edit 2 :  but that marriage is not for them , since it naturally serves the aim of giving life to next generation . 
  you should really take biology classes . 
  humans do n't reproduce via marriage . 
  marriage is not a requirement to reproduce . 
  ** unprotected heterosexual intercourse , not marriage , serves the aim of giving life to next generation . 
  ** animal kingdom is full of reproduction , and humans are the only species with marriage , and ** even with humans , people constantly reproduce without marriage . 
  ** marriage is less natural than homosexuality , as marriage only occurs within human cultures whereas homosexual behavior is rather common in animals . 
  oh and by the way you said this is agenda pushing :  maybe when you keep hateful ideology behind alleged human rights advocacy are n't you doing that right now ? 
  you are pushing an ideology where : 1 . 
  homosexuals should not have equal human rights , no equal treatment before the law 2 . 
  homosexuals are `` unnatural '' , a negatively loaded term . 
  homosexuals are bad parents . 
  have you considered that perhaps there are reasons why people who think like that are labeled as homophobic ? 
   lgbt activists and politicians who adopted lgbt agenda so , everyone who supports equal rights for lgbt people ? 
  * everyone of them * uses dirty tactics ? 
  so if someone waves a rainbow flag because they support equal rights to lgbt people , * even without asking these people * you claim they are abusing religious people , tradition , social norms , and so on . 
  how do you know they do that just by seeing them wave a rainbow flag ? 
  oh and secondly , social norms and traditions are not holy . 
  progress in society happens by questioning old social norms and traditions . 
  in medieval islamic world it was a social norm and tradition to enforce marriage with sex , even when the bride was a child . 
  are you arguing it was right for muhammad to have sex with a 9 year old child , because it was a social norm and a tradition ? 
  ** if social norms and tradition should not be questioned , criticized nor revised , then you can not but defend the fact muhammad had sex with a 9 year old girl . 
  **  yes , lgbt rights agenda is supported by the left - both mainstream and radical ( like greens , etc. ) . 
  so what ? 
  hitler supported animal rights . 
  does that mean animal rights are married to nazism ? 
  of course not . 
  you have a fallacy in your logic . 
  just because y is supported by x , it does not mean y is dependent on x. 
  your argument is like * because every pop singer is a human being , so every human being must be a pop singer * . 
  also , lgbt rights are supported many others besides the left . 
  in finland the economically right national coalition party for example has had an official stance to support same sex marriage for a long time . 
  likewise the swedish national party , which is not a left wing party , supports same sex marriage . 
  if your argument holds true , this situation should be impossible in finland . 
  yet this situation exists . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  besides , previously you were talking about the * radical left * . 
  now you broadened to talk just generally about the left . 
   the leftist vision of lgbt rights is the only one you know and accept - like most of the people in the west . 
  it 's not leftist . 
  apparently to you this is identity politics . 
  you do n't like equal rights for lgbt people , so you associate them with another thing you do n't like : leftist politics . 
   telling gay people about the chastity is considered funny at best um , so what ? 
  are you triggered if someone considers that funny ? 
  if someone considers it funny , that 's really no basis to claim you are being insulted or abused . 
   or when you say homosexuality is not natural , since human sexuality is based on the principle of complementarity - you 're labeled `` fascist '' and `` homophobe '' . 
  firstly , it does n't matter what is natural and what is not . 
  cancer is natural . 
  rape and murder and high infant mortality are natural . 
  reddit , antibiotics , eyeglasses , chemotherapy are not natural . 
  ** if you are trying to argue that natural = good and unnatural = bad , then are you for rape , cancer and infant mortality and against reddit , antibiotics and eyeglasses ? 
  ** secondly , ** homosexuality appears naturally in humans , therefore it is natural . 
  ** simple as that .
