   homosexuals have to get the `` right '' to marry each other - it 's like a dogma . 
  uh , what part of * equal human rights * did you miss ? 
  ** equal treatment before the law is a human right . 
  ** if straight relationships are given a legal prestige and protection via marriage , then due to equal treatment before the law , same sex relationships should have the same treatment . 
  are you against equal human rights as a dogma ? 
   `` gay rights '' equals `` right to get married '' and then - adopt children . 
  is it good for them ? 
  who cares . 
  it 's been extensively studied : '' * [ scientific research consistently shows that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents , and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents . 
  major associations of mental health professionals in the u.s. , canada , and australia have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_parenting ) * ''  you 're religious ? 
  bad . 
  [ ... ] and we ca n't really promote such rights in religious societies , so we need to destroy religion , make it marginal , call religious people `` bigots '' , and `` fascists '' , compare them to hitler and nazis and hate them - to promote `` social progress '' , defined by the left of course , because they have monopoly to say what is progress and what is not . 
  not true at all . 
  for example gay people can get married in most of the churches in the nordic countries . 
  prides here have religious people and representatives of the church taking part . 
  * this proves your claim how everyone supporting equal rights for lgbt people is abusing religious people to be a false claim * . 
  finland has only one purpose built mosque , [ this one ] ( http://www.ess.fi/incoming/2015/07/19/1266721_.jpg/alternates/w640/1266721_.jpg ) dating to the 40 's and built for the finnish muslims who defended finland in wwii . 
  it 's outside helsinki , so helsinki does n't have purpose built mosque either . 
   i can see activists and politicians do some good stuff for homosexuals and others , like trying to protect them from strict laws like death penalty for homosexuality , but this is not all they do . 
  who are `` they '' ? 
  everyone who supports equal rights for lgbt people ? 
   specific `` marriage '' of `` lgbt '' activism with radical left , and using homosexuals in pushing leftist agenda is purely political , hence ideological stuff . 
  what specific marriage of lgbt activism with radical left ? 
  like supporting equal rights for lgbt people is married with radical left , and it is impossible to support equal rights for lgbt people without being married to radical left ? 
   lgbt ideology goes way beyond advocating human rights for `` sexual minorities '' . 
  lgbt is not an ideology . 
  lgbt stands for lesbian , gay , bi and trans . 
  it refers to a group of people . 
  if you claim those things are an ideology , then surely heterosexuality too is an ideology , yes ? 
  and heterosexuality then is an ideology which advocates genocide of minorities ( countries have death penalties for homosexuality ) . 
  so if you support human rights for heterosexuals , you are advocating a genocidal ideology . 
  that 's how your logic works the other way around . 
  so , advocating human rights for lgtb people does n't count as agenda pushing . 
  for example in finland marriage is defined by the law and is independent of any religions , but religious groups can apply to a permission to wed couples . 
  civil unions were like marriage lite , a separate legal entity from marriage . 
  mostly the same legal rights and duties , but some restrictions . 
  people in civil unions could n't jointly adopt children , as only married people could jointly adopt . 
  people in civil unions also could n't change their names automatically like married people could . 
  civil unions did n't require any official ceremony , any kind of rituals from the state , whereas marriage required at least the state to hold a small ceremony for the couple . 
  i nothing else , the name . 
  at what point do you cross the line from advocating human rights to pushing an agenda ? 
  [ it is known ] ( http://imgur.com/yngcwk7 ) . 
  it 's a highway built on the nazca valley . 
  not by greenpeace . 
  [ this might be even more infuriating ] ( https://delange.org/nazca/dsc00306.jpg ) . 
  it 's hip to be square . 
  \u00d3h boy i hope no one tells you about cars and skyscrapers . 
  rapping against aliens . 
  oh wow interesting !, 
  so i learned i was wrong when i thought i was wrong !, 
  then you 'd be pleased about [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6itf4v/the_word_ladybug_in_various_european_languages/dj9m6hh/ ) . 
  it 's not just tilting . 
  for many countries , some features have been omitted . 
  like the other bar from nordic cross . 
  the aim here clearly is to take the central color scheme and create an uniform look based on it . 
  if this would just be tilted flags , the look would be much less uniform . 
  it 's rather comparable to how [ household pennants in finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_pennant ) are often stylized color schemes from the regional coat of arms instead of just being the coat of arms . 
  this gives an uniform style to the pennants . 
  i googled and `` lepp\u00e4 '' does n't primarily mean red , but blood . 
  so it 's * blood gertrud * . 
  during this discussion i learned that the name of the tree comes from [ the reddish color ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/d1/a0/38d1a0e04766b47c1b8c345ffa642e9c.jpg ) the freshly cut alder has . 
  sort of like * sudenkorento * ( dragonfly ) does n't actually mean `` wolf stick '' , but `` summer stick '' , * suven * korento . 
  though the word `` lepp\u00e4 '' has lost its meaning as blood red color , and only means alder in modern finnish . 
  so the modern meaning is more like `` alder gertrud '' . 
  so sad !, 
  more like cryatia !, 
  murica, 
  until winter . 
  oh , how very nice from them !, 
  i did n't know they were that helpful . 
  fun fact : this is the actual inspiration for rivendell in lord of the rings . 
  tolkien had visited lauterbrunnental and the similarities can be seen in the [ watercolor tolkien made of rivendell ] ( http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/rivimages/rivjrrt2.jpg ) . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  there is n't a sausage animal which looks like sausages and is made into sausages . 
  neither is there a meatball animal which looks like meatballs . 
  so , exceptions could be made for plant based drinks which clearly state which plant they are made of . 
  like coconut milk is a completely acceptable term . 
  red emperor hostel has nice and cheap when i have been in tallinn . 
  cost about 20 euros per night i think . 
  i pasted the wrong date . 
  it 's here , 22.9 . 
  the finnish word `` neekeri '' has had the connotation of `` nigger '' for so long that if someone willingly uses it in public , the do it fully knowing it is insulting . 
  racism is not restricted to valuing people by skin color . 
  it is also juding people by their ethnicity and heritage . 
  like a fenno-swede can be racist towards a finnish speaking finn just due to having different heritage . 
  but for example this from ~ ~ 30.9 . ~ ~ 22.9 . 
  2005 :  [ the true culprit is n't the afro who expresses himself exactly as long and as much as the system allows him to express . 
  the true culprit and the legitimate target of hate is the political elite living in utopia , who considers ** the nigger ** to be a poor soul to be taken care of , a teddy bear who does n't care about social harmony ] ( http://www.halla-aho.com/scripta/vahan_rikollisuudesta_vaihteeksi.html ) referring people of african heritage as niggers does n't strike you as racist ? 
  would you use that word in some public speech ? 
  would you say your black customer a nigger ? 
  or when talking about why he would n't interfere with a rape , which he considers likely to be by an immigrant :  [ other and probably more important reason is that i would n't want even in the least amount to take risk where i would have to pay damages for `` pain and suffering '' to ** some african horn human scum ** . 
  ] ( http://www.halla-aho.com/scripta/viela_raiskauksista.html ) if someone is willing to use that kind of language in the 21th century , and even when called for it refuses to take it back , i see no reason why not to consider them as racists . 
  edit : corrected the date of the text and added links to the finnish texts . 
  yes , they are wrong . 
  saying that someone like halla-aho is racist is not political correctness , not a witch hunt , it 's not persecution to call halla-aho a racist , and his writings undeniably have strong racist rhetorics . 
  calling him a racist is a different thing from him getting a sentence . 
  fyi , you do n't need to be a member of the parliament to be a minister . 
  and also before the elections of 2011 we had a corruption scandal involving all three major parties , the national coalition party , center party and social democratic party , causing major frustration towards them .
