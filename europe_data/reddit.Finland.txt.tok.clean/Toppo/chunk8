  i would allow it , even though i would disagree with them . 
  that 's different from favoring them . 
  democracy is n't about allowing ngo 's and opinions you agree with . 
  it 's about everyone having the right to start an ngo and have opinions of their own , without the government censoring . 
   hungary has taken a stance against foreign-run ngo 's invading their politics why is it any worse that a foreign run ngo is influencing politics than a domestic led ngo ? 
  you say that a foreign ngo like transparency international is worse than a say , domestic neo nazi organization ? 
  transparency international should not have the right to influence the politics via it 's local office branch ? 
  well , to me it looks more of [ this ] ( http://www.knowledge.me.uk/photos/dales/picture/foxup_moor.jpg ) than the average [ finnish landscape ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_smold1qjojg/tbp_5jryhyi/aaaaaaaabne/aopv9nc7ism/s1600/img_1585.jpg ) . 
  it 's `` blue moment '' in finnish , * sininen hetki * . 
  november in finnish is `` marraskuu '' , which does n't mean anything anymore to most , but comes from latin `` mors '' , death . 
  so it 's `` death month '' . 
  taking that , and october in finnish and december in ukrainian , you 'd get : * october = dirty slushy sleet month * november = death month * december = road bumb month how positive !, 
  [ this ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/62148020.jpg ) reminds me more of british islands than finland . 
  reminds me of `` lapset ovat kuin pieruja - jokainen pit\u00e4\u00e4 vain omistaan '' , meaning `` children are like farts - everyone likes just their own ones '' , though i really have n't heard that anyone particularly likes farts . 
  ** finnish ** * perseet olalla , literally * arses on shoulders * = extreme drunkenness . 
  * nakit silmill\u00e4 , literally * wieners on eyes * = extreme drunkenness . 
  * pellit kiinni , literally * hatches closed * = extreme drunkenness . 
  * kyrp\u00e4 otsassa , literally * have a cock on forehead * = to be angry , especially because being so bored . 
  * hiekkaa pillussa , literally * sand in pussy * = when a woman is angry . 
  * sitruunapillu , literally * lemon pussy * = a bitching woman . 
  vomiting can be called * speaking norwegian * . 
  to fail at some task or mission , is `` ryssi\u00e4 '' , meaning * to russian it * . 
  gibberish is * pig 's german * . 
  the english idiom `` that 's greek to me '' is * that 's complete hebrew * in finnish . 
  thanks for noticing !, 
  i 'll add !, 
  armenia for some reason was not on [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:world_heritage_sites_in_europe ) list so i missed it . 
  well , we have gotten used to wooden architecture , but our wooden architecture is more unique on an european level than bastion fortresses . 
  * ** revontuli ** , literally `` fire of the fox '' = aurora borealis / northern lighs . 
  * ** kuunsilta ** , literally `` bridge of the moon '' = [ the vertical reflection of moon on the water ] ( http://vuodatus-media-1.vuodatus.net/g/188/989016.jpg ) * ** t\u00e4hdenlento ** , literally `` flight of a star '' = shooting star . 
  * ** kuunsirppi ** , literally `` sickle of the moon '' = crescent moon . 
  * ** ukkonen ** , literally `` small/dear old man '' referring to ukko , the thunder god of the pagan finns = thunder . 
  months that have an understandable meaning in modern finnish : * january = `` tammikuu '' , literally `` oak month '' , but original meaning was `` core month '' . 
  * february = `` helmikuu '' , literally `` pearl month '' , according to some referring to icy pearls that form on trees on the end of february when temperatures start rising . 
  * may = `` toukokuu '' literally `` farming works of the spring - month '' , as `` touko '' means field work carried out in the spring . 
  * june = `` kes\u00e4kuu '' , literally `` summer month '' . 
  * june = `` hein\u00e4kuu '' , literally `` hay month '' , referring to agricultural haywork . 
  * august = `` elokuu '' , literally `` living month '' , referring to agricultural word `` elonkorjuu '' , the gathering of the crops . 
  * septemger = `` syyskuu '' , literally `` autumn month '' . 
  * october = `` lokakuu '' , literally `` dirty slushly sleet month '' ( loka = dirty slushy sleet ) * december = `` joulukuu '' , literally `` yule month '' . 
  finnish has some terms reflecting the recent agricultural past . 
  '' * puinti * '' is the word for treshing cereals to separate the edible grain from the stem . 
  '' * riihi * '' is a word for a small building where cereal crops were treshed and then dried . 
  from these we get sayings like these : * aivoriihi * = brainstorming in a group , aivo meaning brain . 
  * kehysriihi * = the government negotiations on budget , kehys meanin frames . 
  * riihikuivaa * = adjective for net income . 
  literally `` dry as from riihi '' , used like `` i get 1000 dollars of * riihikuiva * money '' , meaning you get the 1000 dollars and no taxes or anything go from that . 
  and when you settle some conflict , like someone has an argument , or something is very unclear to different people , causing confusion , settling this thing is `` puinti '' as in separating the grain . 
  related is also `` erotetaan jyv\u00e4t akanoista '' , which has the meaning `` let 's see who is the real thing and who 's not '' . 
  literally it means `` let 's separate the grains from their scales '' , which is something that happens while threshing cereals . 
  yes . 
  so much this . 
   you can take the cologne cathedral which is one of the most impressive buildings in the whole world but you take a boring park which just was awarded unesco in recent years . 
  the album had a `` read me '' in the beginning . 
  i wrote : '' * the criteria has been uniqueness and attractiveness , and somewhat being less known sites ( when present ) . 
  * '' while colgne and aachen cathedrals is impressive , cologne cathedral is very famous , and the aachen cathedral is n't by it 's looks that unique . 
  there are tons of gothic cathedrals in europe which are unesco sites , and if i were to list every `` i want this from my country ! '', 
  the list would consist just of gothic cathedrals , palaces , old towns and castles . 
  the park is very unique on the european level . 
  this list is about unesco world heritage sites , not about everything countries have . 
  of the unesco world heritage sites in netherlands . 
  one criteria for me was that the site is distinctive on the european scale , and of course that it looks pretty . 
  of the [ dutch world heritage sites ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_world_heritage_sites_in_the_netherlands ) amsterdam seemed the best choice . 
  what would you suggest ? 
  the other sites are [ suomenlinna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomenlinna ) , [ pet\u00e4j\u00e4vesi wooden church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pet%c3%a4j%c3%a4vesi_old_church ) , [ industrial area of verla ] ( http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/hae_kuva.aspx?id=102815&amp;ttyyppi=jpg&amp;kunta_id=286 ) , [ geodesic measurement points ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/struve_geodetic_arc#finland ) and some bronze age stone graves . 
  so which would you choose ? 
  out of those , the colorful wooden architecture seemed the most unique on the european scale . 
  old rauma is the largest wooden old town in northern europe . 
  and as stone and concrete have been the main construction materials in europe , the wooden town stands out from majority of old towns in europe . 
  naturally finnish people have gotten used to old colorful wooden architecture and think nothing out of it , but for many foreigners the wooden architecture of northern europe is rather unique . 
  if you look at other unesco world heritage sites from northern europe , there are a lot of wooden sites , like the norwegian one i listed . 
  well it is less known and less recognizable than the eiffel tower , notre dame or versailles . 
   now there is reports that these sanctions are hitting russia and finland as well as other countries - hard , and all of the sudden there is talks going on . 
  they have n't really hit finland hard . 
  the effect has been marginal . 
   you have not clue what [ the talks ] are all about neither have you , but yet you are sure to claim `` they will pressure ukraine '' * without any kind of information about the content of the talks * , even though niinist\u00f6 has said that * finland sides with the eu and the sanctions by eu * . 
  and again , niinist\u00f6 did not say he is there to be a peace mediator . 
  he just said he wants to have a line of communication with both . 
  so  how talks are going to stop invading country , is irrelevent , because niinist\u00f6 did n't go there to a ) get peace by pressuring ukraine or b ) get peace by stopping russia . 
  i did not say talks will bring peace oer that niinist\u00f6 even is there for that . 
  these are cultural , not natural heritage sites . 
  giant 's causeway is an unesco natural heritage site . 
  the criteria with the sites and photographs was to present something rather distinctive and unique within europe . 
  i do understand that durham cathedral might be appreciated on the uk level , but on an european scale , other sites of england might be more distinctive . 
  there are tons of gothic cathedrals in europe , like [ this ] ( http://www.google.fi/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-2sdywlfqbdg%2fuseikotfg4i%2faaaaaaaab4e%2faxuls1rvd-w%2fs0%2fcologne%252bcathedral%252bultra%252bhd.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uhdwallpapers.org%2f2013%2f12%2ftravel-in-similan-islands.html&amp;h=2160&amp;w=3840&amp;tbnid=ztwpt5vtsnwqhm%3a&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=gfdijus_aquvwm&amp;ei=4erwu83kmohqyqpt5ok4cg&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ved=0cemqmygbmbs&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=1220&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=38 ) and [ this ] ( http://www.google.fi/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fmegahdwall.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f06%2fparis-notre-dame-cathedral-of-205830.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fmegahdwall.com%2fhigh-resolution-wallpaper%2fparis-notre-dame-cathedral-of-205830.html&amp;h=768&amp;w=1024&amp;tbnid=09q_vcyfgrrdsm%3a&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=cyd-rd0ufby3em&amp;ei=8erwu9w6oqqaygo0z4lycg&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ved=0cc0qmygpma8&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=1213&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=37 ) and [ this ] ( http://www.ourtravelpics.com/seville/seville_042.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/0_amiens_-_cath%c3%a9drale_notre-dame_%281%29.jpg ) and so on . 
  reason was that there are tons of cities with walls in europe , and the wall as such is n't that unique in europe but the location of visby by the sea and the garden like streets are more unique . 
  the pictures where one could see the wall , the city and the sea were aerial , and they then lose the detail of the city . 
  the criteria with the sites and photographs was to present something rather distinctive and unique within europe . 
  i do understand that city walls are unique in sweden , but on an european scale , other qualities of visby might be more distinctive . 
  well , the problem i encountered while doing this that there are tons of historic centres in europe , and tons of palaces with gardens like [ this ] ( http://planetden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/palace_of_versailles1.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.apicaserta.it/images/home.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://baintonbikes.com/imagefiles/selfguided/blenheimpalace.jpg ) , and when you put all of them into the same list , they detract from each other , and as other countries have palaces and historic cities , the palace & city you mentioned are not as unique , whereas the river valley is distinctive within whole europe . 
  well , the problem listing them as a serial form , one country per time would be this : `` may i present to you , the 50 unesco world heritage sites of italy ! '', 
  `` may i present to you , the 2 unesco world heritage sites of estonia ! '', 
  well , i 've never been to london and the first views that come to mind are the westminster palace and london bridge , both on the river . 
  hey i wan na do that also !, 
   we do not like helsinki all my friends from espoo like helsinki and are n't really opposed to the thought of merging . 
  a few of my friends have moved to helsinki . 
  it is , but europe is filled with fortresses from the same era , whereas the old rauma is more unique on the european level as colorful wooden architecture seems to be mainly a northern european thing . 
  yea , it was a really difficult choise , because some of the athos monasteries are just [ amazing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/athos_13.jpg ) and look more like buddhist monasteries . 
  but the stone pillars of meteora got me to choose that one . 
  the small rural village did not feel right compared to the palaces and bridges of budapest , so i put budapest instead .
