** they ** absolutely do need a good paddlin ' !, 
  yeah sweden , what a douche !, 
  what ? 
  our pensioners especially love portugal !, 
   the germans gave us military equipment , tanks , artillery , planes even troops . 
  sure , but not because they cared about us or anything but because it served their interests . 
  so i would argue that instead of helping us they merely used us . 
  but whatever , no point arguing about semantics . 
   or do i have to give you the definition of the word ? 
  why so sour ? 
  are you familiar with [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) ? 
  nazi germany was one of the reasons why the winter war started , so saying that germany helped us is a bit strange . 
  it would be difficult and risky for us to leave the eurozone . 
  i think we would be better off if we just addressed our structural problems . 
   there were even talks of uniting the countries at one point , fun fact : [ finland was actually willing to rejoin sweden in 1940 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/3uzy7j/til_finland_proposed_to_sweden_in_1940_that_the/ ) , and the negotiations reached a point where a [ draft agreement was made . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nbivgwp.jpg ) one of the reasons why the negotiations failed was because the plan was opposed by both nazi germany and soviet union . 
  after the negotiations had failed finland decided to settle its security problems by allying with the nazi germany , so maybe the soviets made a mistake there . 
  not that i 'm complaining . 
  furthermore only america has the military potential to be a credible counterbalance against russia , it 's not the french or germans who are deploying stealth fighters to eastern europe . 
  which is why both sweden and finland are developing ties to [ usa ] ( http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2016-04-01/pro-american-non-alignment-sweden-and-finland-develop-closer ), 
  silly swedes !, 
  do n't you know that maintaining * `` friendly relations '' * , even if you have to sacrifice your national interests and even your sovereignty , is a winning move ? 
   linguistically finnish is nothing like russian . 
  sure there are some loan words from russian but there are far more from swedish , and there were even more before the [ fennomanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) had de-swedified ( for example replacing loanwords with * `` authentic '' * finnish words and changing the grammar ) the finnish language . 
  edit : ops , i guess i misread your comment . 
  i thought you claimed that finnish is linguistically similar to russian . 
  russians yes , russia is usually considered to be our only potential enemy and we have a difficult history with them ( not just ww2 but also the cold war when they held a gun to our head ) . 
  germans nope . 
  with the exception of ww1 and ww2 finnish-german relations have usually been about trade since the time of hansa merchants . 
   will need at least f-16 / mig-29 those planes are n't exactly uncommon , but i do n't know what romania 's security concerns are . 
   so mig 21 is better than nothing . 
  would n't modern jet trainers be good enough for that role , since mig 21s are largely useless anyway ? 
  but are n't weapons one of the things ` murican are really good at ? 
  how are you going to defend freedom with bad weapons ? 
  seriously , afaik f-22 is a better air superiority fighter and the f-35 is more versatile and is better in air to surface role . 
  i take it you are n't familiar with the authentic [ finnish santa claus ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4wag2hw47g/uqycxlgnsni/aaaaaaaacks/moyxysdpeks/s1600/pukki+pot.jpg ), 
  you mean like finns ? 
   we are not swedes , and we do not wish to become russian , so let us be finns, 
  i figured as much , kids are kids after all . 
  edit : i just read the thread , i thought the school was for grade schoolers or something lol . 
   still dark , cold and depressing . 
  heh , you think that 's depressing ? 
  cute !, 
   i will suffer 5 hours of watching nothing but grass fields and depressing sky . 
  just like home back in [ ostrobothnia ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a4/73/cf/a473cfef8ad6d625b8cbc5ea956824a3.jpg ) !, 
   do n't know what this is , but it looks nice . 
  i agree !, 
  more interesting than your typical concrete boxes . 
   `` art '' on my `` lovely '' desk . 
  up to this point i did n't think it looked that different from finland , however my school desk was covered with '' [ spiders ] ( http://supervaalikone.com/images/ehdokas_kirkkovene.jpg ) '' instead of swastikas . 
   i 'm from the north myself , and the north was mostly white , so i never encountered any civil war scars growing up apparently the war is still referred to as `` freedom war '' by some people in southern ostrobothnia , and calling it a civil war is considered to be a sign of communism . 
   and french . 
  some people take german really ? 
  i have always thought that german is more popular than french . 
  yeah finland is undergoing a rather drastic structural change , but if companies like m-files and optofidelity are of any indication tampere will eventually come up as winner as long as it plays it 's cards right . 
  i 'm more worried about my current hometown oulu . 
  so many mistakes have been here and now the city is paying for them . 
  yes , every summer my sister and her husband force me to visit their m\u00f6kki in a nearby island ( somero ) . 
  nope , thank god for the onion router . 
  people still use those ? 
  i can faintly remember wood burning saunas from my childhood , but all saunas i have been to have been electric saunas . 
  the last time i was in sauna was like five months ago so i do n't really know what i 'm talking about . 
  well from a finnish perspective anything before 20th century is ancient history . 
   huh . 
  i would have thought that the swedish minority in finland would be at the same economic level as most ordinary finns by now . 
  but there is still a clear divide ? 
  didnt know that . 
  there is n't or at least my swedish speaking relatives do n't fit the stereotype . 
  but then again majority of people in ostrobothnia have always been middle class people . 
  i 'm not the best person to explain this since min svenska \u00e4r mycket perkele , but kokkola has ( or had ) it 's own distinct swedish dialect `` grundspr\u00e5\u00e5tji '' . 
  there is a book written about it and i have heard they give courses on it . 
  another wooden area nearby is [ skata ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flveuloniiq ) in pietarsaari ( eller jakobstad ) . 
  i have to admit that it looks more interesting than neristan . 
  yeah it was only like 200 years ago , that 's like yesterday . 
   `` be in one of the  100k cities , or lose money by buying your house '' . 
  generally that is the case , but the west coast has been doing quite well ( at least relatively ) in recent years . 
  kokkola has similar gdp/per capita figure to tampere ( 35k vs 37k out of my memory ) while having a lower unemployment rate . 
  honestly op 's living standards do n't seem to be that special to me . 
  my sister lives in the same town with her family and they seem to have roughly similar living standards ( they own their home , they have two cars and but instead of a motorcycle they have a boat . 
  oh and they have two kids ) . 
  the `` b\u00e4ttre folk '' mostly live in south . 
  most swedish speakers in kokkola region are simple middle class folk . 
  furthermore it is not uncommon for finnish speakers to have swedish names in kokkola . 
  in kokkola the old town area ( called [ neristan ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/neristan ) ) [ is filled with wooden houses ] ( http://visitkokkola.blogspot.fi/2014/08/kaupunkilaisten-vinkit-matkailijoille_25.html ) , and some of them date back to 17th century . 
  i guess they are adorable . 
  not everyone is being affected by the current economic downturn , and so far the west coast ( the area where he is from ) has been doing [ relatively better than rest of the country ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/west_coast_least_troubled_by_forestry_mobile_phone_collapse_-_leads_in_gdp_comparison/7865138 ) . 
   he 's pretty much an upper class , as he 's a company owner not all business owners are plutocrats , on the contrary many small business owners are not any richer than your average middle class person . 
  edit : and as / u/thenorwegianblue put it , he lives in a small town ( i 'm from there ) so naturally his living expenses are lower than if he lived in helsinki or something . 
  ah kokkola , red or green ? 
   if you 're looking for a 5th gen fighter well i do n't really know what we are looking for , the idea that we should prefer a 5th generation aircraft is just my two cents . 
  in the media people mostly talk about the f-35 and gripen ng , so i think we 'll choose between them . 
   super hornet is a better alternative for finland unfortunately the super hornet has it 's problems , namely that it 's main operators ( namely usa navy and to a lesser extend australia ) are going to remove it from their service which would leave finland as it 's sole operator , and a country as small as finland ca n't really support a fighter 's entire logistical infrastructure . 
   my hopes are that finlands choses the gripen ng i would n't hold my breath since america is our most important defense partner , [ according to our defense forces ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fi&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000001127381.html ) . 
  furthermore why should we buy a 4th generation aircraft instead of a 5th generation if we are going to use it for decades ? 
  i mean is gripen ng ( or the other 4th generation aircrafts ) going to be modern in 2040 ? 
   on par with the best radars in usa inventory based on what ? 
  afaik russia does n't have an operational aesa radar yet , whereas usaf has been using them for many years ( i think since late 90s , not sure though ) . 
   sukhoi pak fa * mig-35 [ this is incorrect ] ( http://www.defenseworld.net/news/14915/finland_seeks_information_from_european__american_manufacturers_for_hx_fighter_program#.vxis3efqdme ) : finland 's ministry of defense ( mod ) has issued a request for information for its new hx-fighter aircraft program . 
  * the mod has sent a letter to great britain , france , sweden and the us * about the project launch on the 16 this month . 
  buying russian aircraft is a no-go for obvious reasons .
