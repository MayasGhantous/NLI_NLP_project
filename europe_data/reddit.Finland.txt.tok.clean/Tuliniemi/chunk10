  and the reason we do n't have a common european defence is because the different countries have radically different security challenges and needs . 
  because finland would have tough time defending itself let alone providing assistance to baltic states , and how are we supposed to move troops to say lithuania if they were attacked ? 
  we do n't exactly have [ great maritime transport capabilities ] ( http://lintukuvaaja.kuvat.fi/kuvat/others+sekalaista/ships+boats+sailing+laivat+veneet+purjehdus/jurmo1314ctomimuukkonen.jpg?img=full ) . 
  the only thing we could do for them is to help to defend their airspace with our air force but even that would be hard and we would at serious disadvantage against russia . 
  outside of nato finland has 0 ability to defend baltics . 
  loanwords especially from swedish are quite common in finnish , and they were even more common before the de-swedification in the nationalistic time period . 
  for example i can remember that my older relatives used words like [ * `` h\u00e4st '' * ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/51nhtw9exnl._sx355_.jpg ) [ * `` kaffel '' * ] ( http://pngimg.com/upload/fork_png3062.png ) and [ * `` hanttuki '' * ] ( http://www.supercat.se/shop/14698/art98/h6406/19896406-origpic-68f244.jpg ) . 
  see , we are n't so weird after all !, 
   we 're never thanked for it . 
  well i 'm grateful that you helped us to stay on the better side of the iron curtain during the cold war . 
   for starters russia is infamously corrupt . 
  i am sure that far less of the european military budget money is lost before reaching army units than russia 's . 
  i 'm sure the eastern europeans are delighted , i mean what good does it do if the europeans are incapable or just unwilling to use military force ? 
  also just because europe spends more money on defense does n't automatically mean it has greater military capabilities . 
   world does n't mean that it is everybody 's duty to do the same . 
  according to the article europe is over-reliant on the usa for things like intelligence and electronic warfare . 
  and how well are those resources utilized ? 
  for starters europeans are infamously disunited . 
   nato admits it has an `` over-reliance '' on the u.s. for the provision of essential capabilities , including intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , air-to-air refueling , ballistic missile defense and airborne electronic warfare . 
  i guess this confirms that the idea of common european defense is just a pipe dream . 
  if our country is called `` baltica '' does it mean we no longer have mandatory swedish ? 
   unfortunately for everyone , hitler did n't gave a shit about neutrality if it did n't suit him . 
  neutrality only works when others respect it , however if ( or when ) interests change you are fair game !, 
  true , and the worst case scenario is that we become enemy of both nato and russia . 
  however according to our leaders we are no longer neutral but * `` military non-aligned '' * even though we have very deep relations to nato sweden and usa . 
   neither nato nor russia could really afford to let finland be neutral . 
  sweden might manage to stay out if they really wanted to . 
  i have heard that the opposite is the case , finland has a better change of staying neutral ( though finland does n't seem to be as neutral as people tend to believe ) than sweden because sweden is geographically more important in the baltic sea . 
  no number for finland , or is it same as in sweden ? 
  germany has reputation of being highly bureaucratic , now i do n't know whether this is true or not . 
  i have read that it 's easier to attract american investors to finland than swedish investors . 
  now i do n't have anything against co-operating with nordics but why stop there when you can go global ? 
  there are plenty of potential markets and partners around the world , for example we should definitely steal the idea of [ asymmetric funds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asymmetric_fund ) from israelis . 
  afaik we are n't particularly close to them . 
   what do you think of the estonian accent ? 
  estonian sounds adorable and i mean that as a compliment . 
   do you know any estonians ? 
  i have met some , but i do n't have any estonian friends atm . 
  estonia . 
  while i have never been to estonia i 'm very sympathetic towards them and the progress they have made since the collapse of the soviet union seems to be impressive . 
  i 'm ashamed how some of our politicians have treated them ( for example halonen with her ramblings about post-soviet traumas ) , and i wish to apologize for our vodka-tourists . 
  now i do have my views on politics and economics but i 'm to a certain extend a russophile . 
  i 'm impressed by russia 's contributions to physics and mathematics . 
  while ago i met a russian guy and i was impressed by his knowledge of finnish literature ( like minna canth and mika waltari ) and i was really embarrassed of my ignorance about russia . 
  i also had a russian girlfriend back in school who had a really exciting accent . 
  superb !, 
  i would like to see high rise buildings with nice glass facades here too . 
  i guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder , also i 'm finnish after all so pessimism is kinda ingrained into my soul . 
  my issue is that we do n't have any amazing high rise buildings here . 
   here 's the tallest one in bulgaria : damn , everyone seems to have better architecture then we . 
  behold the finland 's tallest building [ hotel torni ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/tornihotelli.jpg ) in tampere !, 
  i like it , it has certain brutal charm . 
  looks nice , damn even romania is beating us in architecture . 
  the upcoming ctrl + c ctrl + v high rise cluster in [ kalasatama helsinki ] ( http://i.imgur.com/znc1frt.jpg ) needs something like that . 
  finland is in the game as `` east sweden '' . 
  gustavus adolphus of sweden ... [ during the time that the hakkapeliitta were being employed , finland was the eastern half of the swedish kingdom . 
  ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) technically accurate . 
  yes were we preparing against invasion from the west , and just to be sure we practiced of defending our eastern flank . 
  also here is an analysis on finland usa relations by security analyst charly salonius-pasternak . 
  not sure if this is correct at all but it is definitely interesting . 
  [ not just another arms deal : the security policy implications of the united states selling advanced missiles to finland ] ( http://www.fiia.fi/fi/publication/279/not_just_another_arms_deal/ )  ** do n't ask do n't tell : the mutually beneficial yet opaque finnish-us bilateral relationship **  finland and the united states have a strong , deepening and mutually beneficial , yet slightly opaque relationship . 
  in the web of multilateral , multinational and bilateral relationships that finland is weaving to enhance its security , the us relationship is a key cable . 
  the jassm deal serves as an additional sign of , and result of , how strong the bilateral usfinnish relationship is . 
  cooperation between the united states and finland is extensive , and has expanded into a number of areas during the past two decades . ^ 6  in the field of personnel education and training , the united states annually sends soldiers to be trained at a range of different finnish units , including the finnish defence forces international centre ( fincent ) . 
  finnish officers attend both short and long courses at us academies and staff colleges as well as serving as fellows at prestigious universities such as harvard . 
  during the past few years , the first finnish soldiers have been trained to operate as joint tactical air controllers ( jtacs ) to coordinate air-to-ground attacks . 
  finnish soldiers also serve in regional commands such as centcom , and participate in a number of international exercises . 
  lacking its own tanker fleet , the finnish air force has also worked with us air force europe ( usafe ) to certify finnish pilots for aerial refuelling . 
   the two countries also cooperate increasingly in research and development , with finland ( and germany ) contributing expertise to a project to understand how aluminum-hulled ships react to battlefield stresses , such as mine or torpedo explosions . 
  the new class of finnish navy surface vessels ( laivue 2020 ) will also benefit from us experiences with the littoral combat ship ( lcs ) and its mission modules . 
  finland 's efficient approach to developing and procuring materiel may even benefit how future lcs mission modules are built . 
   the veil of secrecy that covers much of the cooperation is , however , notable . 
  this speaks for mutual trust , strong discipline and a culture of secrecy on both sides . 
  cooperation is rarely discussed in any detail , making it difficult to assess the potentially positive and negative consequences of an increasingly close relationship . 
  the silence also highlights how politically sensitive extensive cooperation with the united states still is . 
  however , despite some public misgivings about close cooperation with superpowers , finnish civil servants and a handful of politicians have worked for two decades to develop a relationship which is built on trust and a mutual desire to achieve concrete results and military capabilities . 
  the fact that finland has become only the second country in addition to the united states to add jassm to its inventory is testament to the success of this work . 
   ^ 6 the development of cooperation can be seen in the need to agree to and sign different types of official agreements , memoranda of understanding and technical agreements . 
  the first , signed in 1991 ( sops 95/1991 ) is a basic document . 
  additional agreements followed in the mid-1990s and early 2000s , with the most recent ones being signed in 2010 ( sops 95/2010 ) and most recently an overall agreement on r & d cooperation ( he 5/2012 vp ) . 
  it is difficult for us civilians to judge the situation properly since we do n't know all the facts , for example the official report on cooperation between sweden and finland is ten pages long while the secret one is ten times as long . 
  and this is nothing new as even back in cold war days sweden supposedly store extra fighter jets for finland . 
  but i think i agree with you as long as neither sweden and finland are not in the nato . 
  however finland also has cooperation with usa and if security analysts are to be believed the cooperation dates back to cold war years and is deeper than most people realize . 
  i guess alakurtti is just a datsa ? 
  well there is [ this ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/daily_finland_to_sign_defence_cooperation_pact_with_uk/8996698 ) and finland 's defense relations with sweden and usa are supposedly quite deep , so thankfully we are not leaving everything on dialogue . 
   typhoon 's captor-m typhoon still does n't have an aesa radar ( captor-e i believe ) ? 
   how fucking retarded we are on average . 
  nah you ca n't be as bad as we are , we still do n't understand the importance of urbanization . 
   which for sure has been bad also for other reasons than currency . 
  exactly , even if we did n't have the euro we would still have our structural problems ( dependency on nokia , most exports being investment goods , retarded urbanization policies and russia 's collapse for starters ) . 
  now maybe we would have done as well or even better if we were n't in euro , but since it would be difficult and risky for us to leave ( or so the economists say ) the common currency we should just focus on our addressing our structural problems imo . 
  actually that was a joke . 
  some people here seem to blame the euro for everything , and this map shows that we have done ok over that time period even though we had the euro for most of that time . 
  maybe i should have used the '' / s '' tag, 
  aldrich , saint of the deep . 
  as we can see the euro has definitely hindered our economy . 
  finnish ingenuity !, 
  do n't be ridiculous !, 
  why would you want to confuse the two ?
