  you may accidentally throw away perfectly good drinks !, 
  this is actually my perspective on europe . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_skittles ) kyykk\u00e4 came to finland from east . 
  note that the m\u00f6lkky is a different game . 
   as we can both agree that scandinavians are peaceful and civilized sorry but i do n't agree with that , at least not if we are talking about 19th century . 
  back then swedes viewed finns as subhumans who were too stupid to govern themselves , so i 'm not sure if swedes would have allowed finland to leave and since finns ( at least the western finns ) had already been largely assimilated at that point i 'm not sure if they would have even wanted to leave ( in fact i think they initially wanted to remain in sweden ) . 
  i think it 's possible that we would have just become another wales . 
  but who knows what would have happened . 
  the 19th century was pretty good for us , there were no significant wars and economy developed nicely . 
  there is a reason why there is a statue of alexander ii in helsinki . 
  sure the honeymoon ended when the nikolai ii started the russification program , but even then there were russians , and especially russian intellectuals , who were against it and actually had respect for us . 
  at the same time swedish intellectuals were ranting about inferior mongoloid finns . 
   the single greatest mistake of swedish foreign policy since becoming a democracy was to not intervene on the side of finland during ww2 i 'm grateful for the sentiment , but in my opinion you did enough . 
  i mean there really was n't much more you could have done for us , though i 'm glad in retrospect that you did n't [ take us back when you could have ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/3uzy7j/til_finland_proposed_to_sweden_in_1940_that_the/?st=iq5qxchd&amp;sh=3b3b7ce7 ) . 
   there is just so much shit unfortunately i agree with you . 
  while i do have a soft spot for russia , the russia today is not the kind of russia i would want to love . 
  i fear that our politicians are just too weak to stand up for our country if needs to be . 
   if the alliance between finland and sweden was as strong as it is supposed to be . 
  i would n't get my hopes up , there is no alliance between sweden and finland and our cooperation seems to [ be largely empty talk ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kaleva.fi%2fuutiset%2fulkomaat%2fruotsalaistutkija-turha-odottaa-ruotsilta-merkittavaa-sotilasapua%2f719431%2f&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  honestly i would like to see both of us in the nato . 
  in the meantime we should strengthen our relations to other western countries , and fortunately this seems to be happening . 
   i cant for the life of me figure out how that is possible that 's what almost half a century worth of forced '' [ neutrality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) '' does to you . 
  also the situation between finland and russia is not black and white , and despite being a massive `` russophobe '' even i 'm willing to admit that at times we have benefited from russia ( we would still be eastern sweden if it was n't for russia and the 19th century was pretty good for us overall and i think we would done much worse as a part of sweden ) and whether good or bad we ca n't just ignore them . 
  do n't get me wrong , i despise our spineless politicians ( v\u00e4yrynen and other crooks should be in jail ) . 
   finnish universities still expect you to pass a 2nd language exam as far as i know . 
  true , but most people just do n't care and will not learn anything beyond the bare minimum of what is needed to pass the exams . 
  i even wrote one of my swedish essays with a help of google translate . 
  my teacher , smiling happily : ah , i see you have been practicing your swedish !, 
  me : yeah sure . 
  we do ? 
  granted , i do n't personally care about nordics but majority of finns do n't speak swedish at any meaningful level . 
  anyway , i just try to use combination of english and gestures when i 'm dealing with someone who does n't speak english . 
  sometimes i may also use sound effects . 
  fortunately dairy industry 's share of our exports is very low . 
   it was a mistake for your country to become dependent on imports to russia . 
  now you 'll have to obey . 
  finland is not dependent on russia . 
  around [ 60 % of our trade ] ( http://ek.fi/wp-content/uploads/tal76-2.png ) ( ven\u00e4j\u00e4 = russia , euroalue = eurozone , muut eu-maat = other eu countries and muu eurooppa = other european countries . 
  exports are on left and imports are on the right ) is with eu countries and russia is not a [ particularly important investor to finland ] ( http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
  yes , i 'm sure we would be able to negotiate with germany and france as equals . 
  [ our economy was growing at reasonable pace ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_growth_outpaces_eu_average/8929988 ) so i 'm not sure if the sanctions will have any further effect as long as the russia does n't decline further . 
  however it is possible that our growth expectations for this year will be cut by 1/3 after the brexit . 
  whether we buy it or not does n't really matter here , what matters is that the us has offered it for us and i do n't think they would offer it to just anyone . 
  sanctions have had a minuscule effect since the sanctions only cover a small portion of our trade with russia , the real reason why our trade with them has declined is because of russia economic problems . 
  furthermore a significant portion of finland 's exports to russia have been re-exports . 
  [ america is now a larger export destination for us than russia . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fi&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.taloussanomat.fi/kansantalous/2015/09/24/yhdysvallat-nousi-suomen-kolmanneksi-tarkeimmaksi-vientimaaksi/201512419/12 ), 
   not contemporary culture . 
  well the subject was originally about how a british guy feels closer to northern europeans , to which you replied that finns have nothing in common with you . 
  so of course what matters here is the contemporary culture . 
   well that is just silly . 
  i suppose , and i 'm not blaming you , but it just makes me nervous . 
  i have had people telling me to go back to siberia because of `` my genes '' ( ironically i have a swedish surname and some swedish ancestry ) . 
  and why does this even matter ? 
   no , i did n't say that . 
  * `` your culture is closer related to the sami people of norrland in sweden , or hungarians and the baltic countries . 
  '' * we have as much as common with them as much as portuguese have in common with iranians . 
   i was not ranting i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to blame you personally . 
  but that 's what i often have to put up with when i encounter someone who is `` interested '' in my culture , so my emotions sometimes get the better of me . 
  i do apologize for getting over emotional . 
   no , i was not thinking of stuff like that . 
  so you do n't know anything about us or our culture . 
  pretty much all of our traditions have european origins . 
   root of the language and cultural group of finnish is in the same language and ethnic group as baltic-finns . 
  which has basically zero relevance today , or do you think finns today are the same people who lived here 1000 years ago ? 
   ( and even swedish speaking areas , which i 'm sure i do n't need to tell you about ) . 
  i 'm from one of those areas , well at least from one of the areas where you can actually hear swedish in finland . 
   i am not lecturing , i am posting some opinions and facts . 
  you said : * `` your culture is closer related to the sami people of norrland in sweden , or hungarians and the baltic countries . 
  '' * the fact is that your average finn has no idea what you are on about , and this it not because we think ill of hungary ( for example ) or something but because hungary never had any real relevance to us . 
  for example did you know that english used to be a somewhat common language in my current town of residence ( oulu ) back in 19th century ? 
  there was a lot of trade with them back then , and do you know how much trade we used to have with hungary ? 
  in fact i think it 's possible that more finns speak japanese than hungarian since we have more dealings with them . 
   i mentioned these are used to trace origins of culture and nothing more . 
  no offense but it really freaks me out when people start babbling about genes , it feels like i 'm dealing with a neo-nazi or something ( not saying that you are ) . 
   you have much in common with swedes ( you are nordic for fucks sakes ) did n't you just say that we have more in common with samis and hungarians , and how we do n't have connections to anywhere and have nothing to do with germanics ? 
  not that i care , personally i do n't give rat 's ass about nordicism or whatever it 's called . 
   so that seems funny to me . 
  it should n't , there is nothing new or unusual about swedish racism and chauvinism towards finns . 
   as a celebration of diversity and similarity . 
  if the celebration means i have to listen someone ranting about my culture and about my `` asian ancestry '' and how my children will have `` mongol spots '' ( or whatever those things are called ) as it usual is then please count me out . 
   i admire finnish culture for what its worth can you name a single finnish writer , poet , composer or any cultural tradition we have ? 
  russia is not nearly as important to us as people seem to believe , for starters around [ 60 % of our trade is with eu countries alone ] ( http://ek.fi/wp-content/uploads/tal76-2.png ) ( ven\u00e4j\u00e4 = russia ) and virtually all foreign investments to finland [ come from western countries ] ( http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en_007.gif ) ( [ source ] ( http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2014/ssij_2014_2015-10-30_kat_001_en.html ) ) whereas russia is not a significant investor to finland . 
  so while russia is an important trading partner for us , the west is far more important and we should choose them over the russia if we have to . 
  maybe we should duck next time . 
  whether the sanctions are a good policy or not is debatable . 
  however only something like 1/5 of finland 's trade with russia has been affected by the sanctions , the real reason why our trade with them has collapsed is because of russia 's economic problems and especially due to collapse of ruble . 
  in fact our trade with them was decreasing even before the sanctions and the collapse of oil prices . 
   i do n't know if there 's any country like that for finland ( sweden ? ) . 
  not really , we have pretty diverse array of trade partners . 
  traditionally germany , sweden and russia have been our biggest partners and usa has become increasingly important in recent years . 
  roughly 60 % our trade is ( or was ) with eu countries . 
  however we are a small and therefore a weak country , so we can always be pressurized politically and militarily . 
  eidt : trade partners of : [ ireland ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irl/#destinations ) and [ finland ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/fin/#destinations ) . 
  the data seems to be little bit old . 
   germanic cultures . 
  the people in finland have been influenced by germanic cultures ( and other european cultures ) for centuries , for example there have been finns studying in german universities since at least 15th century . 
  and lot of finns have ancestry outside of finland ( me included ) . 
   your culture is closer related to the sami people of norrland in sweden , or hungarians and the baltic countries . 
  i do n't think you know anything about our culture because at least i do n't feel any connection to those groups , well maybe the estonians are an exception but i do n't know much about them personally .
