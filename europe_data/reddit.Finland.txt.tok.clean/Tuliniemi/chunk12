  seriously it 's annoying how every now and then i encounter someone who begins to lecture me about my culture and how i 'm related to some people i have never heard of . 
  it feels obnoxious and chauvinistic . 
   there has also been genetic analysis that follows up these cultural categories ( haplotype maps ) and you can see they have the same conclusion ( lower r1a and r1b haplotypes ) one of my friends is a person of vietnamese origin who was born and raised here in finland . 
  i guess he has nothing in common with me in terms of culture ? 
   i think you 'd have a hard time anybody who thought of finnish people as lesser people . 
  when i was in germany i encountered a group swedes who immediately began to rant how i do n't belong to there because i 'm not germanic or some shit like that after they had heard where i was from . 
  they stopped after my german friends told them to shut up . 
  edit : i 'm sorry , it 's getting late here and i 'm getting sleepy . 
  as i said it 's tiresome to hear the same memes about my culture over and over again , so i just felt like ranting . 
  my apologies . 
  yes , and some ( silly ) people also blame the eu for our problems with russia . 
   the us seems unlikely to sign a lone finland-us agreement to publicly guarantee defense of finland . 
  the article was about increasing cooperation and said nothing about security guarantees , and the cooperation between us and finland seems already to be somewhat extensive considering that us has allowed finland to buy advanced weapons like jassm and f-18 and the f-35 is a candidate for our next fighter . 
   because they are finnic i have heard people calling us `` finnic '' before but what does that even mean ? 
  if you are implying that we some kind of subhuman mongoloids then you are wrong . 
  [ please do n't come we are homos .

  actually we do n't have that many russians here . 
  and around 60 % of our trade is with eu countries . 
  the amount will slightly decrease after the uk leaves but still a majority of our trade will be with the eu countries . 
  shame , i think it would be fantastic if we were some small isolated country next to russia . 
  this is just a scheme by the brits to get [ their boat back ] ( http://www.kokkola.fi/palvelut/kulttuuripalvelut/museot_ja_perinnetyot/kh_renlundin_museo/nayttelyt/vene/en_gb/vene/ ) . 
  seriously though , deepening relations with western countries is a good thing especially since the eu looks ... somewhat unstable . 
  thanks for mentioning this , my understanding of the ww1 has always been rather vague .

  looks fine i suppose but i 'm not sure if i like the surface design . 
  i take it you were n't present at our high school graduation party .

  i hate to sound like a typical `` patriot '' but the ww2 is the most important event in our short history . 
  our economy has n't crashed we are just stagnant . 
  sure things are not brilliant but they could be faaaar worse . 
  edit : also i would n't take these kinds of studies too seriously . 
   finland would n't and will not survive . 
  that may have been true like 50 years ago or something , but that 's no longer the case : swedish is an irrelevant language for vast majority of finns , and these days we are influenced by germany and usa at least as much as we are influenced by sweden . 
  we also have a maritime cluster , health tech industry and various other industries ( like chemicals and various machinery ) . 
  nokia is also still around and entrepreneurship is starting to take off . 
  [ i did n't invest in eastern poland :( ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knk7dredg3i ), 
  do n't know about berlin since i have never been there , but the parts of germany i visited were just stunningly beautiful . 
  heidelberg especially felt like something out of fairy tales . 
   germany instead . 
  good choice !, 
  southern germany especially is lovely , baden-w\u00fcrttemberg < 3, 
   it was more of a `` we do n't need the eu , we have the commonwealth '' . 
  are there actually any meaningful links between the commonwealth countries ? 
  for example they do n't seem to trade that much with each other according to my quick googling . 
  trade partners of : [ uk ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/#destinations ) , [ canada ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/can/#destinations ) , [ india ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/ind/#destinations ) and [ australia ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/aus/#destinations ) . 
  officially it 's [ whooper swan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whooper_swan ) , though all true patriots know that our real national bird is [ ukkometso ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_lw3qrtfm ) !, 
  you are mostly right , however finland has also received influences from directly from germany and other european countries for centuries . 
  for example there were finns studying in germany back in 15th century and we imported national romanticism from germany . 
  could you please tell them that we need some good architecture here ? 
  damn , why ca n't our plutocrats do something like that ? 
  very nice . 
  why is it that we ca n't ever build anything nice ? 
  though i suppose the [ new central library ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/9/97/keskustakirjasto_1.jpg ) will look at least somewhat interesting . 
  not sure if i 'm happy or annoyed about the fact the almost everything in my life seems to be associated with sweden in one way or another . 
  well , that was a lame joke from my part but thanks for reminding me about vispipuuro , have n't tried it for years . 
  i 'm kind of surprised that someone with a swedish flair knows the name . 
  do n't forget the delicious m\u00e4mmi !, 
  somewhat disappointed , i believe in the eu despite it 's flaws and i do think it would be sad if the eu were to fall apart , but i do respect will of the british people . 
  i like brown eyes , i find them to be exotic .

  according to supercell 's founder ilkka paananen the supercell is europe 's first `` decacorn '' , a startup with a valuation of at least 10 bln . 
  because norway refused to join eu and therefore needs to be punished ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  * ei-jaf-allah-jokyll * see , it 's easy !, 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okkupert )  the eu , in desperation , asks russia to initiate a velvet glove invasion of norway . 
  russian special forces kidnap berg , insisting that he submit to eu demands or face a full-scale invasion . 
  you know , i 'm a massive russophobe but even i think this is a little far-fetched . 
  is this why women drown less frequently ? 
   oh , and we also erect a gigantic phallus covered in flowers that we drunkenly dance around in some of my swedish speaking relatives have that tradition , and i think i participated in it once when i was a child . 
  anyway , i think i 'll celebrate this midsummer by playing witcher 3 : blood and wine . 
  i did , and i also found this article : '' [ is kazakhstan getting eurasian union blues ? 
  ] ( http://www.eurasianet.org/node/77731 ) '' does n't seem like a happy family to me . 
  rising population + strong urbanization trend = [ more high-rise buildings ? 
  ] ( http://www.ldcol.com/wp-content/uploads/kalasatama_4_web.jpg ) if so then sweeeeeettt !, 
  i do n't know anything about those countries , but i suppose the eeu could have some appeal to isolated post-soviet central asian countries . 
  however russia does n't seem to be the primary trading partner for either country : [ tajikistan ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/tjk/ ) and [ uzbekistan ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/uzb/ ), 
  are there actually any potential new members ? 
  honestly i do n't see why anyone in europe would want to join . 
  the eu is the world 's second largest economy so i do n't see what the eurasian union could offer . 
  nokia had manufacturing and r&d operations around the world like every other truly global company , but they still employed lots of people here in finland , which why especially salo , oulu and tampere have been hit so badly . 
  did you read the article ? 
  nokia accounted for 4 % of our gdp and 21 % of our total exports , and more importantly nokia accounted for lion 's share of our high technology exports , and high technology products are the kind of advanced high value added goods that a developed 1st world country is supposed to produce ( instead of third world level goods like paper ) . 
  furthermore nokia was our only really strong global consumer brand . 
  most of our exports are investments goods ( elevators and various machinery for example ) and while there is nothing wrong about making investment goods it 's also important to have consumer goods because if the demand for investment goods drops due to lack of investments in the world you would have at least something to sell . 
  if the old nokia was still around it would be far easier for us to handle our current economic problems . 
   that was innovative , but also targeted at an audience that would never sustain nokia . 
  i was under impression that it sold reasonably well ( at least when compared to lumias ) despite the fact it was n't launched in the us or in the larger european countries . 
  of course it is entirely possible that it was too little too late . 
  true , but the consumer market is also potentially much larger and losing it was a catastrophic failure no matter how one looks at it . 
  however as i said nokia has done very good job at turning things around since then . 
  i think that is possible , there are some good things happening in our economy for example entrepreneurship is starting to takeoff and certain sectors are doing ok ( like maritime cluster and health tech ) and the strong urbanization trend should help as well . 
  however finland 's economy is still very fragile and is vulnerable to external shocks , for example we would be in serious trouble if china were to crash . 
  no not really , the phone business was far larger than the network business so nokia is still a shadow of its former self . 
  however nokia has done great job during the last few years so it 's entirely possible that nokia may do a comeback . 
  well the good news is that nokia left behind a trained workforce and other benefits , so it should be possible for us to diversify our economy and to a certain extend this is already happening .
