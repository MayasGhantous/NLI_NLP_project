   estonia should be given to germany 's sphere of influence why ? 
  should n't estonia be also absorbed into russia along with finland ? 
  maybe i 'm not just crazy enough to understand his reasoning . 
   putin did not beat around the bush that he understand his offer as competition to ttip . 
  europe has enormous possibilities , it would be wrong to reign them in with ttip , he warned . 
  [ usa is a larger trading partner to eu than russia ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6760204/6-27032015-ap-en.pdf ) , and eu 's trade with russia was declining even before the sanctions and collapse of oil prices . 
  even finland exports more stuff to usa than to russia these days . 
   finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' maybe my crazy gun nut cousin is n't so crazy after all . 
  we also have blood sausage here in finland , it 's called '' [ mustamakkara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mustamakkara ) '' or black sausage . 
  another food with blood is '' [ r\u00f6ssypottu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6ssypottu ) '' . 
  blood seems to be popular in these parts . 
  edit : rotten sharks sounds horrifying !, 
   first of all we 'd have about 100 000 new unemployed sure if we were to cut all subsidies immediately . 
  however if we were to reduce them progressively by say 20 % - 30 % over the period of next 5 to 10 years then there should n't be such a massive problem . 
  and there are other ways to support agriculture , for example by cutting down regulations which is something the farmers have complained about . 
  and does there really need to be any agriculture north of [ `` p\u00e4hkin\u00e4saari '' border ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4hkin%c3%a4saaren_rauha#/media/file:p%c3%a4hkin%c3%a4saaren_rauha.png ) ? 
   secondly your daily food bill would triple . 
  our food is already one of the most expensive in europe despite our massive subsidies ( [ largest in the world according to some ] ( http://www.talouselama.fi/tebatti/suomessa-on-maailman-korkeimmat-maataloustuet-3435446 ) ) . 
  there are other factors affecting the food prices , like for example the fact that our grocery retail industry is essentially owned by 2 companies and there is no real competition . 
  do you remember how people reacted when lidl first expanded here ? 
  turned out that more competition is actually good for the consumers , so maybe that 's something we should focus on ? 
  and what prevents us from importing food from abroad ? 
   have n't even the slightest idea of european agriculture and it 's economical realities . 
  i have been told that sweden has abolished their national agri subsidies , and they seem to be doing fine . 
  sure , southern sweden is more favorable to agriculture than southern finland , but if they can live without subsidies then ca n't we at least reduce them little bit ? 
  just to help to balance our budget at least ? 
   i 'm willing to bet you do n't even know ( without googling it ) why the system was implemented in the first place . 
  i have to admit that * i do n't * actually know since i do n't work in that industry , but i have been told ( and i have read ) many times that we have to support domestic agriculture in case we ca n't buy food from abroad . 
  i agree with this view , but do we need current level of agricultural production to cover our security needs ? 
  and are subsidies even the best way to support our agriculture ? 
  and i do n't base my opinions on my ignorant and biased views , i base my opinions on what i have read and heard from proper professionals , and i can assure you that there plenty of experts out there who have criticized our agricultural policies in a far greater depth than i 'm able to . 
   just kindly shut up already about the agri subs you know what , i agree with you this is getting old and there are far more interesting things going on in our country . 
  but let me ask you something : do you think it 's sensible for us to cut from education and r&d , which you know are essential things needed for maintaining an advanced industrial base which we need in order to be able to produce sophisticated high value-added goods and services ( instead of third world level stuff like pulp ) , while we are spending billions ( according to professor [ esko niemi ] ( http://www.taloussanomat.fi/kotimaa/2010/08/03/professori-maataloudelle-miljardi-euroa-piilotukea/201010628/12 ) for example ) in economically non-productive ways ? 
  and one more thing , i 'm not a five year old . 
  i 'm willing debate my points in an intelligible manner and i 'm willing to concede my points if i 'm proven wrong . 
  are you ? 
  sure if we are talking about 1/5 of our total exports , however russia 's share of our exports have traditionally been around ~ 11 % which is significant but not absolutely vital since around 60 % of our exports go to eu countries . 
  so while russia is an important trading partner for us , losing 1/5 of our trade with them is not a matter of live and death in the long term . 
  and the sanctions have nothing to do with being nice to the yanks , we just do n't want to be part of the `` happy eurasian family '' . 
  only about 1/5 of our trade with russia has directly been affected by the sanctions . 
  our trade with russia has collapsed mainly because of russia 's economic problems . 
  furthermore [ the yanks are now a larger export destination for us than russia . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.taloussanomat.fi%2fkansantalous%2f2015%2f09%2f24%2fyhdysvallat-nousi-suomen-kolmanneksi-tarkeimmaksi-vientimaaksi%2f201512419%2f12&amp;edit-text= ), 
  tl ; dr [ there are regions in finland ] ( http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/documents/publications/mapsofthemonth/momsept11/mom_09-2011.pdf ) that are not economically self sustaining and require wealth transfers from the wealthier regions , and usually the money is n't spent well and is wasted on useless things ( like keeping an airport which no one ever uses open with taxpayers ' money ) . 
  a year ago i read a book written by a finnish economist where he talked about his experiences in the former soviet union and his descriptions of the ddr felt oddly familiar . 
  well fuck , maybe then people will finally understand that we need real reforms . 
  if not , then maybe sweden will be kind enough to buy us back . 
  is there a god who is n't a vicious cunt ? 
  not really , finland was doing fantastic between 2000 and 2008 . 
  our current problems are due to really bad luck ( first 2008 happened , then euro crisis started , then nokia lost its phone business and finally russia collapsed ) and our own stupidity ( * moar agricultural subsidies and damn dem cityfolk ! * ) . 
  and btw , my hometown kokkola ( or karleby ) had the fourth largest merchant fleet in sweden when it was still part of sweden , so being * '' [ landlocked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landlocked_country ) '' * ( which finland is n't ) is not really that big of a problem . 
  as a nokia shareholder i hope this will never happen , returning to phone business would be like jumping into a pool filled with sharks and crocodiles . 
   as for what 's ailing finland , here 's an abbreviated rundown : also our trade with russia has collapsed and we spend billions every year in nonproductive agricultural subsidies and pork-barrel projects ( while simultaneously cutting from education and r&d ) , for example how much money did we pump into talvivaara again ? 
  however our economy [ seems to be growing again ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/bank_of_finland_revises_economic_forecast_upward/8944203 ) , so as long as the world 's economy remains more-or-less stable we may finally be recovering ( please china do n't crash !, 
  yes . 
  we used to place birch trees front of our home at mid summer . 
  however i do n't remember seeing any mid summer bonfires , we have always burned bonfires at easter . 
  their f-16s are more modern and more capable than our f-18s . 
  size is not really that important when it comes to reducing the radar signature , unless the difference is at least around order of magnitude . 
  shape of the aircraft , materials used and intake design are far more important factors . 
  small size also had disadvantages , like for example limited capacity for fuel and weapons which restricts aircraft 's performance . 
  of course whether this matters or not depends entirely on what the aircraft is designed for . 
  i 'm sure rosatom would love to build a nuclear power plant for you !, 
  yes , it has been estimated that our economy would have been recovering if our trade with russia had n't collapsed . 
  however russia , while important to us , has n't been our main trading partner since the collapse of the soviet union . 
  around 60 % of our trade is with eu countries , and germany and sweden ( and even america ) are in many ways more important to us . 
  edit : now that i think about , it possible that it is sweden and not russia that has traditionally been our main partner . 
  as long as the building boom is based on urbanization , then yes i think it is . 
  in fact i think our economy will get healthier as we become more urbanized . 
  of course eventually we 'll have to address our other issues , like filling the void nokia left behind . 
  around [ 9.8 % ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/bank_of_finland_revises_economic_forecast_upward/8944203 ) . 
   the construction and service industry lead the promising upswing . 
  i wonder how fast our economy would grow if the hillbillies in our government would just accept our inevitable urbanization . 
  no ... not enough snow . 
  ah snus , the disgusting substance the people here in oulu seem to love . 
  one of the reasons , along with ikea and candyland , why people visit haaparanda . 
   finns are simply more outgoing than us in sweden really ? 
  the stereotype here is that you swedes are bunch super happy and outgoing people . 
  now that sounds more familiar !, 
  the nile looks quite neat . 
   i was standing at a bus stop in helsinki when my local friend started waving at an approching bus is that normal ? 
  i have never done that and i have never seen anyone to do that . 
  but i do live in the west coast . 
  earlier today when i was leaving my apartment i quickly slammed the door shut after i saw the elevator stopping at my floor . 
   it is n't the fault of the finns . 
  absolutely !, 
  we spend billions every year in agricultural subsidies ( while at the same time cutting from r&d and education ) and we are probably the only developed country that is trying hinder the natural urbanization trend . 
  clearly we are not responsible for our own problems !, 
  and we only got to fire bb guns !, 
  [ would it be ok for us to skip this one out ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_during_the_great_northern_war ), 
   we are the only nation that competes with the usa on being technologically advance i take it you have n't heard of japan or germany , or south korea . 
  i thought majority of swedes are now supporting nato membership ? 
  they apparently have a [ good corporate tax system ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/pm_estonia_a_model_for_finnish_corporate_tax_system/8061509 ) . 
  i have been wondering if estonia will eventually surpass us since we seem to be incapable of reforming our country . 
  unfortunately . 
  yeah nokia used to make all sorts of things : rubber boots , tires , military radios , toilet paper and etc. 
  basically for decades [ an agrarian hillbilly party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_%28finland%29 ) has been resisting natural urbanization trend , so every year we are spending billions to keep those areas populated since many of those regions [ are n't economically self-sustaining ] ( http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/documents/publications/mapsofthemonth/momsept11/mom_09-2011.pdf ) . 
  [ no , i 'm not making this shit up .
