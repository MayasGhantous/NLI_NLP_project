  i think we 'll choose between f-35 and gripen ng , and i would put my two cents on the f-35 . 
  those are authentic ostrobothnian puukkos !, 
  i do n't know if central ostrobothnia , or kokkola region , has it 's own traditional clothes . 
  you are just jealous of our umlauts . 
  at first i was annoyed , but then i remembered [ what our politicians are like ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uusisuomi.fi%2fkotimaa%2f170473-matti-vanhanen-valayttaa-suomen-ja-ruotsin-valtioiden-unioni&amp;edit-text= ) , now i am laughing . 
  i hope you are right , the last few years have been quite demoralizing . 
  this may happen sooner than later if people here do n't get their act together . 
  at least then they can to nordic !, 
  our prime minister / u/juha _ sipila has plenty of capacity !, 
  i think the swedes have already [ bought ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rautaruukki-ssab-idusbrea0l09n20140122 ) [ enough ] ( http://www.miningweekly.com/article/boliden-buys-finnish-nickel-copper-mine-for-712m-2016-03-10 ) . 
   nokia had been a big pride for finland which is one of the reasons why we are in trouble . 
  nokia was our sacred cow and we basically became a * `` nokialand '' * . 
  we would have been much better off with a more diverse economy . 
   went on to sell out to microsoft the deal with microsoft was actually pretty good if you ignore all the sentimental nonsense and examine to deal from a pure business perspective . 
  nokia is still around and is by far our most valuable company . 
  german , french , spanish or russian . 
  far more interesting than our [ `` plains '' ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/mpwicks/9484106748/ ) . 
  ostrobothnia is a region of finland known for it 's flatness . 
  the land is actually rising from the sea and centuries ago the whole region was below the sea . 
  why are you so cruel ? 
   meaning your former vassal states need to have a shred of respect left for you i do n't want to sound unis\u00c4mmaallinen but did n't they just increase the amount of mandatory swedish in our schools ? 
  and you are n't ? 
  i have been hearing all my life how happy and cheerful you svedut are . 
  do n't you have norway ? 
  they even speak * your * language !, 
  as an ostrobothnian i find this to be weirdly arousing . 
  unfortunately it is always easier to blame others than it is to address your flaws . 
   explain why would n't it benefit finland ? 
  leaving euro would bring some theoretical benefits , but it would be extremely challenging as [ finnish economist sixten korkman put it ( article in finnish ) ] ( http://www.hs.fi/talous/a1455157705504 ) , and there are potential downsides as well such as very high interest rates [ ( good thing i do n't have any loans ) ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qebluqrl--/18k287qlp93jcjpg.jpg ) . 
  furthermore euro is not responsible for our structural problems ( for example : being dependent on single company , aging population , trade with russia , lack of entrepreneurship , unfinished urbanisation and so on ) . 
   holidays abroad would become more expensive afaik all imports would become more expensive and since we import most of our consumer goods people would still have to pay the bill . 
  there are no free meals . 
   sweden did n't and they 're doing much better sweden also has a much more diverse economy ( for example they have ikea , h&m , volvo , saab , ericsson , electrolux , klarna , spotify and so on while we have angry birds , pulp and elevators ) and has fewer structural problems because , instead of sitting on their asses , the swedes actually reformed their economy . 
   leaving the euro now wo n't bring back the money we 've lost in the past decade or so . 
  people yearning for markka do n't seem to remember that markka was essentially a third world currency and we benefited from the stability euro provided between 1999 and 2008 . 
  we can argue whatever joining euro was a mistake or not ( i 'm willing to concede that i 'm unsure myself ) until the cows come home , but it will not fix the issues of our economy . 
  unfortunately there are plenty of *** is\u00c4mmaa !, 
  *** rednecks in our country . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5-ahidzqas ), 
  honestly i do n't understand why sweden would agree to this . 
   where does this idea that finland 's military is so much greater than sweden 's come from ? 
  because professionals are n't posting stuff on reddit . 
  [ paavo v\u00c4yrynen for ~ ~ president ~ ~ king !, 
  ] ( http://kepu.fi/ ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ keminmaa, 
  a freely floating currency could work , however the problem is that it would be really difficult for us to leave the euro zone . 
  for example we would have to create a new payment system to replace the [ target ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/target2 )  maybe finland should adopt the swedish krona ? 
  this could actually be more sensible , but we could always just address our structural problems . 
  hey we did ask for collateral !, 
   took away the best bits . 
  [ no not really ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910999/microsoft-job-cuts-2015-nokia-write-off ) . 
  if you bought nokia shares back in 2012 you have made around ~ 200 % gains . 
  which is not bad at all . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  nokia 's phone division was a sinking ship and it is entirely possible that nokia 's incompetent management would have never come up with an effective answer to iphone or galaxy s series . 
  not that i 'm saying that losing phone industry was a good thing , but i think things have turned out ok all things considered . 
  at least nokia now has a change to reinvent itself and start with a clean slate . 
   how else does a market leader go down like nokia did , if not for microsoft dragging them down ? 
  [ nokia was fucked up way before the deal with ms ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/08/nokia-stephen-elop-operation-new-book ) , the decision to focus on the windows phone was just the final nail in the coffin . 
   nokia had only its phones . 
  actually the networks side of nokia has always been profitable , and now that nokia has [ acquired alcatel-lucent ] ( http://www.techtimes.com/articles/121397/20160104/nokia-acquires-alcatel-lucent-17-billion-become-major-player-broadband.htm ) it is now the second largest player on the market . 
  and since nokia is no longer losing money from it 's phone division ( its now microsoft 's headache ) it can now freely focus on growth industries like [ internet of things ] ( http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/21/nokia-growth-partners-announces-350m-fund-focused-on-iot/ ) and [ virtual reality ] ( http://www.wired.com/2015/11/nokia-ozo-vr-camera/ ) . 
   they would still be market leader today . 
  are you sure ? 
  even with the best management i think it would have been very tough to compete against apple and samsung and the emerging chinese manufacturers like huawei . 
  eh , at least the quality of our football games would improve . 
   nokia could have adapted or nokia could have gone bankrupt . 
  it looks like it was the [ microsoft that got the short end of the stick ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910999/microsoft-job-cuts-2015-nokia-write-off ) . 
   look at finland . 
  to be fair a large portion of finland 's problems are self-inflicted . 
  i think lapua 's [ coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua#/media/file:lapua.vaakuna.svg ) is also very cool . 
   i would have thought it would be a little better off since a lot of trade would flow through that region . 
  i 'm from western finland so i do n't really know that much about eastern finland or their trade with russia , but as far as i know [ lappeenranta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lappeenranta ) is finland 's gateway to russia . 
   or has always been a little poorer than the rest of finland ? 
  pretty much . 
  edit : [ and it looks like the trend is going to continue . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/west_coast_least_troubled_by_forestry_mobile_phone_collapse_-_leads_in_gdp_comparison/7865138 ), 
   finland has to start cutting back on it 's social spending . 
  or we could cut agricultural subsidies and pork barrel spending ... but instead our [ hillbilly government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_%28finland%29#founding_of_the_party ) is cutting from education and social spending . 
   i can only assume that the economy has n't effected most people yet , basically yes , and there are also [ large regional differences in finland ( link pdf ) ] ( http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/documents/publications/mapsofthemonth/momsept11/mom_09-2011.pdf ) so when people talk about finland being rich they are talking about southern and western finland , however [ kainuu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kainuu ) for example is not rich . 
   we should be encouraging the growth of new businesses and business models in every economic sector . 
  well obviously . 
  unfortunately our country is filled with agrarian hillbillies ( agricultural subsidies ftw and fuck urbanization ! ), 
  and leftist curmudgeons ( last year there was like 143 strikes in finland while in sweden there was only 5 ) and our right-wing parties seem to care only about big businesses and do n't seem to give a fuck about startups or small-businesses . 
  ca n't say i enjoy any of them since there are no positive stereotypes about us . 
  [ time to send in klamydia !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vitvhe4tnii ), 
  ca n't think of anything bad about canada . 
  no , i think you are talking about our prime minister sipil\u00e4 . 
  [ could someone please explain to me why we tied our economy to russia ? 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsuomenkuvalehti.fi%2fjutut%2fmielipide%2fpuheenvuoro%2fvoisiko-suomi-olla-venajan-hongkong%2f&amp;edit-text= ), 
  i do n't think we could afford to take karelia even if we wanted to . 
  we already have enough money drains as it is . 
  well the question was specifically about countries , not people . 
  though i wonder how many countries/people germans have fought ? 
   how did that come about ? 
  i 'm not sure , it has been a while since i have read about it , but it seems that there are loads of nationalistic myths about our history . 
  i think on possible source is `` kumpujen y\u00f6st\u00e4 '' by aarno karimo which , i believe , used to be popular . 
   cudgel war , afaik the cudgel war was just a typical peasant rebellion and the idea that it was a some kind of a struggle for independence is just an old nationalistic myth . 
  ditto , and i guess it would be nice to have an excellent hockey team . 
  though i 'm more into football .
