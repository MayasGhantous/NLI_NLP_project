   but i 'm not sure should they be counted as they were n't our wars . 
  technically not but if they were then one could , interestingly enough , make an argument that we finns have been at war with each other . 
  for example [ western finns and karelians have traditionally been enemies . 
  do you have a source ? 
  because i have n't heard of any . 
  we have fought : 2 or 1 wars against soviet union/russia 1 against germany and 1 against ourselves, 
  i did n't believe i would ever witness perfection ... but now i have !, 
  [ this !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_lw3qrtfm ) nah not really . 
  actually now that i think of it , i 'm not sure what i should be patriotic about .

  [ according to this ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/finland/government-debt-to-gdp ) our debt-to-gdp ratio was 33.9 % in 2008 , and in 2014 it was 59.3 % . 
  i may not be an expert but that sounds rather quick to me . 
   your debt is tiny the issue is not how much of debt we have but how quickly the amount is growing , and our government seems to be either incapable or unwilling to stop the trend . 
  eventually the interest rates are going to rise . 
  furthermore our aging population is going to limit the growth rate of our economy . 
  at this rate , you may get a change to buy us back . 
   so long as finland does n't start accumulating debt , [ we have been accumulating debt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/finland/government-debt-to-gdp ) since 2008 , and it does n't look like we are going to stop anytime soon . 
  it seems that [ ostrobothnia has been the best performing region ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/west_coast_least_troubled_by_forestry_mobile_phone_collapse_-_leads_in_gdp_comparison/7865138 ) of finland , and as far as i know the region 's economy is largely based on manufacturing . 
   too large public sector due to overextended welfare state . 
  in my opinion , in finland it is too easy to live on welfare and not work . 
  i think pork-barrel spending and agricultural subsidies are far more bigger problems . 
  every year we are spending billions unproductively , and now thanks to collapse of nokia we can no longer cover those expenses . 
  and the worst part is that our government is now cutting from education and from social security : in other words , lowering our living standards . 
  other problems are the relative lack of entrepreneurship ( fortunately this is now changing , albeit slowly ) and the collapse of our trade with russia . 
   you 'll have to fuck up royally ... well we are kinda going bankrupt ... so uhhh ... gib krona big br\u00f6 ? 
   i love the finnish dialect of swedish [ this is for you !,

  [ your new anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9aosff98wg ), 
  poland may not can to space but poland can to growth !, 
  true , but tampere is the second largest city ( if you do n't count espoo ) so it is still worth of consideration imo . 
  what is being said here in reddit is completely different than the impression i have gotten from my relatives and associates . 
  have they been living in a bubble or ? 
   btw , any suggestions on swedish speaking cities in finland ? 
  [ ostrobothnia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrobothnia_%28region%29 ) is probably the most swedish place in finland ( if you do n't count \u00c5land ) , and the economy [ does n't seem to be doing too badly ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/west_coast_least_troubled_by_forestry_mobile_phone_collapse_-_leads_in_gdp_comparison/7865138 ) . 
  besides that i would recommend either helsinki/helsingfors , turku / \u00c5bo or tampere . 
   i mean i love russia but most redditors hate us . 
  i 'll have to admit there are lot of finns who absolutely hate russia & russians , which is not something i 'm proud of . 
   i live sweden but most redditors hate us . 
  huh ? 
  i would have thought everyone would like you . 
  [ even if they adopt a foreign religion ? 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-finland-iduskcn0ur20g20160113 ), 
   we would be much better off by jointly negotiating than this bullshit . 
  i just read a newspaper article about some conference in troms\u00f8 , and this does n't seem very likely at this point . 
  * `` it became clear in troms\u00f8 that norway and finland have n't been coordinating their negotiations with russia . 
  would we get our [ old eastern borders back ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_n%c3%b6teborg#/media/file:treaty-of-n%c3%b6teborg.png ) ? 
  if that is the case then i 'm in !, 
  i suppose your optimism is flattering but ... nope . 
  oh just go to backwoods of kainuu and you will see plenty of diversity !, 
   east sweden aka finland . 
  when will this stupid meme die ? 
  just because swedish is a mandatory subject in our schools does n't mean we are a part of sweden !, 
   ** swedish ** - finnish telecom operator looks like the old habits die hard !, 
  what about russian accent ? 
  movies are n't dubbed here , which is something i 'm really glad about !, 
  well finnish politicians have always been spineless towards russia , so unfortunately i 'm not actually surprised . 
  heh , we finns always brag about how we are so tough , but it looks like we are actually just cowards . 
   norway did well by implementing the quick return policy which stopped most of the human trafficing . 
  why are n't we doing the same thing ? 
  germany does have an aerospace industry , but afaik they mostly participate in multinational projects like eurofighter and tornado . 
  edit : also france and sweden , though the jas-39 uses american engines . 
  i suppose it is hard to compete against lahti . 
  there are n't many countries that can build modern fighter jets , since they are extremely complicated and sophisticated pieces of technology . 
   but in finland everyone interestingly those are n't even the biggest cities in finland . 
  i was kinda expecting lahti to be there , since the place is a shithole , but i do n't know about savonlinna or kuopio . 
  yep . 
  what 's up with savonlinna ? 
  what about non-former soviet clay that is not in nato ? 
  whose brilliant idea was it to tie our economy to this country again ? 
  i 'm somewhat patriotic , but i 'm not at all nationalistic . 
  [ just because something is cheap does n't mean it 's good . 
  ] ( http://www.upi.com/business_news/security-industry/2009/01/15/russia-to-fly-34-mig-29s-that-algeria-rejected/73581232035135/ ), 
   f-35 is a bloated crap , made for the bloated american military . 
  just another pork project . 
  for some reason we seem to love their [ `` bloated crap '' ] ( http://www.fiia.fi/fi/publication/279/not_just_another_arms_deal/ ) . 
   it 's probably most effective against less technologically advanced countries . 
  and that 's where modern jets are mostly used in combat . 
  i would expect a non-stealth aircraft to fare worse against a technologically sophisticated enemy than a stealth aircraft . 
  also , japan is planning to develop a domestic stealth fighter and as far as i can tell it is aimed against china . 
   shape limitations . 
  how is this a limitation ? 
  stealth shape does n't seem to hinder the f-22 in any way . 
   modern fighters like the ef already use heat signatures instead of radar waves , ir-detection has it 's limitations ( like range and atmospheric conditions ) and does n't replace radar . 
  furthermore f-35 also has an ir-sensor so ef has no advantage there . 
   you ca n't hide the heat of the engine as easy no , but you can reduce the ir-signature and both f-35 and f-22 are designed to do that . 
  from experience , swedes have traditionally been more or less chauvinistic towards us . 
   but i doubt stealth will be that interesting in a few years . 
  i do n't think that is very likely since [ everyone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_pak_fa ) [ and ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chengdu_j-20 ) [ their ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitsubishi_atd-x_shinshin ) [ grandmother 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_neuron ) [ dog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bae_systems_taranis ) is working on stealth technology . 
  or , do you think dassault , sukhoi , mitsubishi and other companies are wasting their time and money ? 
   ` stealth ' also has downsides are there any downsides besides cost and maintenance ? 
  mind you , the latest 4th generation aircraft are n't especially cheap either . 
   it is merely less easy or less quick detection . 
  if i had to choose between a plane that can be detected at range of 50km and plane that can be detected at 200km , then i would much rather be in the former .
