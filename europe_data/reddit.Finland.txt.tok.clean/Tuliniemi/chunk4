  true , but the main difference between the f-35 and 4th generation aircraft is stealth which is something that can not be added with an update , since one would have to redesign the entire airframe . 
  is there a reason to buy anything besides a 5th generation fighter ? 
  i mean a 4th generation aircraft ( say f-16 block 52 ) may be modern at the moment , but is that still going to be the case in 2030 ? 
  hockey is popular throughout the country , but afaik the biggest hockey fanatics are in tampere and oulu . 
   than a lot of the germanic nations i do n't know about the other nations , but at least that is not my impression of sweden or norway . 
  in fact they have always come across as smug to me . 
   our politicians can actually be useful when they want to be once in a blue moon i suppose , but i do n't see them to be any more competent than their swedish colleagues . 
   that your politicians are weaker than wet paper and your national pride is in the gutter for a second i thought you were describing finland !, 
  why would anyone object to it ? 
  furthermore when has anyone ever accused swedes or norwegians of being nazis ? 
  fortunately it 's quite popular here in finland . 
  i just love it !, 
  nope . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm an ostrobothnian and therefore the only sports i know are football , [ pes\u00e4pallo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pes%c3%a4pallo ) and greek wrestling . 
  seriously though , i have heard about it but i have no idea what it is about . 
  i 'm sorry , i mean i tried to read the hungarian version first but i just did n't understand it . 
  i understood the estonian version just fine . 
  then why is n't it more popular here in finland ? 
  i mean it 's pretty popular where i 'm from ( ostrobothnia , or more specifically kokkola ) , everywhere else hockey seems to be number 1 . 
  i could n't understand the hungarian sentence . 
   but mostly our technology is if not up to date , at least sufficient . 
  is there enough for the +500 k reserve you suggested ? 
   besides , we have tons of ammunition and guns in storage , great !, 
  now we only need : - modern artillery , and by modern i mean self-propelled artillery . 
  you know , the kind of artillery that can perform modern artillery tactics like shoot-and-scoot . 
  - medium to long range surface to air missiles . 
  at the moment we mainly have short range air defense weapons and nasams is the only medium range system . 
  i suppose the +500 k reserve does n't need modern air defense ? 
  - ability to intercept cruise missiles and [ ballistic missiles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k720_iskander ) and so on ... also you are assuming russia would invade us . 
  what are we supposed to do if they just decide to bomb our country to stone age with cruise missiles and ballistic missiles and block our shipping routes with their navy ? 
   luckily the finnish defense forces know this , so they have realistic plans in case of a war . 
  you mean the same defense forces that has reduced our reserve ? 
  and in case you did n't know [ most of the professionals support nato membership ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/ylimmat_upseerit_haluavat_suomen_natoon_-_onko_se_ainoa_mahdollisuus/7031590 ) . 
  maybe they know something ? 
   finno-ugric unity is there is such thing ? 
  i 'm not sure if your average finn even knows or cares . 
   as brutal as it sounds , we need the +500 000 reserve to defend that whole 1000km stretch of land . 
  and how are we supposed to arm , train and maintain such a large force ? 
  or , do you think that winter war - era level equipment is going to work in modern warfare ? 
  seriously just buying 500k modern radio sets , which are vital to any military operation , alone is going to cost an arm and leg . 
  there is a reason why the size of our reserve has been reduced . 
  ah litmanen our best , and our only , good football player ever !, 
  why would either side agree to that ? 
  i mean would you limit the moving space of your own country by tying it another one ? 
  yeah , we really do n't have a reason to be proud of ourselves . 
  however we did at least support estonia from behind the scenes . 
  [ finns want to rejoin russia and seek protection from western homonazis !,

  sweden always had very close relations with nato and us . 
  it 's actually a common fear here that sweden will join nato and we 'll be left to deal with russia by ourselves . 
  do n't exaggerate !, 
  i mean [ st\u00e5hlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaarlo_juho_st%c3%a5hlberg ) was pretty solid !, 
   hockey is serious business . 
  are n't you more interested in football these days ? 
  at least that is the impression i have . 
  i come from part of the finland were football is actually popular , and i think it is a real shame that our national team is so atrocious . 
  you mean the eu that ca n't agree on how to handle the refuge crisis ? 
  for some reason my heart is n't full of hope . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_narva_%281700%29 ), 
   when in reality , of course , the kremlin 's opinions are less than irrelevant to finland unfortunately our politicians have usually been a bunch of spineless worms . 
  for example our president mauno koivisto was too scared to support the independence of [ baltic states ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/savisaar_estonian_independence_lacked_finnish_support/5195590 ), 
  sweden is surrounded by friendly countries , so i do n't think that is a big issue . 
  they do have a better air force and navy . 
  for example we do n't have any [ aew&c planes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_340_aew%26c ) . 
   we should finally stop pretending and join nato like we should have done a long time ago . 
  absolutely !, 
  of course it is entirely possible that it is too late for us to join nato , and if that is the case then our eu-membership is the only real protection we have . 
  back in 2007 our financial minister uttered the infamous words : * `` ei koske suomea !, 
  '' * or * `` no worries !, 
  finland will not be affected !, 
  '' * naturally our gdp collapsed by 8 % . 
  the guy is now working as a european commissioner . 
  i also think that my country is , at least in some ways , a banana republic . 
  no it 's ule\u00e5borg . 
  i have been told that kemi is much worse . 
  to be fair , there are genuinely beautiful places in oulu . 
  that 's dangerous !, 
  he should have at least worn gloves !,

  interesting , today i learned what [ kekri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kekri_%28fest%29 ) is . 
   finland ( santa claus ) not exactly correct . 
  [ nuuttipukki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._knut's_day ) is closer to krampus than to santa claus . 
   really , actually , i think that 's among the problems , the constant comparisons and attempts to do what sweden is doing instead of trying to find the best way for us . 
  normally i would agree with that , but there are time when we should definitely try to learn something from our neighbors , and it 's an undeniable fact that sweden is doing a lot of things better than we are . 
   but also , unless magic happens in the startup sector as much as i like startups , i think our health-tech , maritime cluster and ee/energy-tech sectors are overall more impressive . 
  true , but i do n't think paper , steel or refined petroleum products are that much better . 
  just compare [ our export portfolio ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/fin/ ) with : [ germany ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/ ) [ japan ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/jpn/ ) and [ sweden ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/swe/ ) . 
  soon you will have overtaken us !, 
  [ rant ] but no worries !, 
  we are going to get our triple-a back by cutting from education and r&d and from social security , and most importantly by not reducing agricultural subsidies or pork-barrel spending because potatoes are a good investment !, 
  soon our credit rating will be aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !, 
  if we are so innovative why are we exporting mainly third world level rubbish like pulp ? 
  i mean sure we are doing well in some areas , like in health tech and in maritime technologies , but we should be doing much better !, 
  well we have also taken a hit since refined petroleum products make up a significant portion of our exports . 
  sure the oil crisis is not the primary reason for our problems ( nokia , russia and our own stupidity are ) but it is n't helping .
