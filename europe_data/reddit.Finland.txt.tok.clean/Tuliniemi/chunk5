  [ exports -12 % due to low oil prices ( article in google-english ) ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.taloussanomat.fi%2fkansantalous%2f2015%2f07%2f08%2fvienti-12-syyna-oljy%2f20158631%2f12&amp;edit-text= ) [ original in finnish ] ( http://www.taloussanomat.fi/kansantalous/2015/07/08/vienti-12-syyna-oljy/20158631/12 ), 
  i would like to think that , but for some reason i am skeptical of the idea that right-wing thugs with criminal background are going to act in a sensible manner . 
   community safer for everybody . 
  does that include my foreign friends ? 
  goddamn immigrants !, 
  i think germany is generally viewed favorably here , i mean sure there are people who are mad about euro or refugees or whatever but they are in the minority . 
  while most people 's knowledge of germany is limited to typical stereotypes ( beer cars and so on ) the more educated ones appreciate germany 's influence on our culture and society . 
  for example finns have studied at german universities since middle ages . 
  the feeling is not mutual as far as most finns are concerned . 
  there was a guy whose name was `` ruotsalainen '' in my school . 
  he was a real brick . 
  i have never seen so many people !, 
   finland has been non-aligned since the ww2 if by `` non-aligned '' you mean being a [ soviet union 's bitch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) then you are right . 
  edit : i guess truth hurts ... 
   give us a call when europe is ready to stand ready to defend itself without i do n't think this is going to happen for a long time if ever . 
  if russia is a threat to finland then i only see two options for us : nato or [ yya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) . 
  i would rather choose nato . 
  according to one theory , the reason why our government did n't want to join nato is because the old nato countries ( usa , uk and germany ) wanted to push the responsibility of defending the baltic states to us . 
  i have no idea whatever this is true or not .

  so i guess you can give back all that tar that was taken from us poor [ ostrobothnians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrobothnia_%28historical_province%29 ) ? 
  you know , back in the old days ostrobothnia was one of the largest , if not the largest , producer of tar . 
  however we were not allowed to sell it directly to foreign customers , instead we had to sell it to those assholes in stockholm at below market prices , who then sold it forward at much higher prices . 
  after 1809 we no longer had to do that and for some reason our economy began to develop . 
  how does that even make any sense ? 
  we are the ones who are free !, 
  i do n't think they are even moving here , vaara ohi !, 
  [ based on our coffee consumption ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finns_and_their_beloved_coffee__they_couldnt_drink_more_if_they_tried/7510668 ) , i would say we are brazilians . 
  [ live footage from tori . 
  ] ( https://www.periscope.tv/ilgga/1yqjdmqgrkexv ), 
   which cultural group do they belong to ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you mean by `` cultural group '' , but there is ( or at least there was ) a cultural difference between western finland and eastern finland . 
  back in the old days ( like centuries ago ) western finns referred to eastern finns as `` ryss\u00e4 '' ( `` russian '' being a decent translation , though the word was originally used to refer to anyone whose religion was orthodoxy '' ) and eastern finns called western finns as `` ruotsi '' ( `` swede '' ) . 
  edit : i 'm from [ western finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kokkola ) and i have had more dealings with swedes than with estonians , in fact i have never been there and i do n't know any estonians , so i ca n't really say anything about estonia . 
   they were a colony of both russia finland had it 's own currency and tariffs when it was a part of russia and traded with foreign countries more or less as it pleased . 
  for example finland had very deep economic ties to uk back then . 
  rather peculiar `` colony '' . 
  i wonder if he will cut agricultural subsidies and pork-barrel spending ? 
  how exactly does immigration prevent people from getting jobs ? 
  25 % of people are worried about economy while 58 % are worried about immigration ? 
  are people drunk or something ? 
  modern finnish language did n't even exist before the late 19th century , since it was created by fennomanian movement . 
  before that people just spoke unofficial regional dialects , and swedish was already the de facto language in the western finland ( for example oulu dialect was basically just a form of broken swedish ) . 
  i was just kidding , but hiironen does sound nice . 
  just too far from the downtown for me . 
   do you know of any ( sci-fi ) author who has explored this subject ? 
  no , but i think i was once read an article about what if finland had remained as a part of sweden . 
  in short : helsinki would never have become our capital , instead finland would have been built around turku ( \u00c5bo ) and ostrobothnia . 
  finnish language would probably be dead . 
   hiironen how can anything so close to kaketsu be any good ? 
   it 's about defending the western world and its values . 
  well maybe as a part of sweden we could have avoided all that finlandization and kekkoslovakia shit , and we would n't have the problems we are now experiencing . 
  however we managed to survive both the second world war and the cold war , and we are now a member of eu and eurozone . 
  furthermore russia 's relevance to us has been declining : for example america is now a larger export market to us than russia . 
  so it looks like that after so much hardship we may get both independence and western values . 
   most people probably do n't even realize finland exists heh , and there are people here who actually think * `` nordic defense cooperation '' * is a good alternative to nato . 
  i just hope that eu and eurozone are going to be enough . 
   remember how nations were run back then your average finn knows next to nothing about history , and if they do it 's the old nationalistic narrative ( evil swedes destroyed ancient finnish nation and enslaved them and blah blah blah ... ) for example i did n't learn until few years ago that i have swedish ancestry . 
  since then i have read more about history and my perception has changed . 
   well , how is viborg doing ? 
  dunno never been there , but we managed to remain independent and we are now a developed nation ( well if our government keeps fucking things up , we may no longer be in near future )  my point is that finland should n't complain that sweden did n't help more than it did . 
  i do n't think any sensible person blames sweden for anything . 
   they should never have left the union in 1905 . 
  are you seriously claiming that norway and finland should never have sought to become independent and should have stayed with sweden instead ? 
  i can sorta understand norway , but why would we want to become an ethnic minority ( like kurds ) when we can have our own country ? 
  just out of curiosity , is this view common in sweden ? 
   so sweden was completely right in not take in finland at that point . 
  in retrospect i 'm actually happy you did n't . 
  sure sweden would have been much better than soviet union , but things have turned out ok for us . 
   why did n't you join sweden right after 1917 ? 
  because finnish nationalism was very strong at that point , so rejoining sweden was out of the question . 
  of course it did n't stop our nationalists from trying to turn our country into germany 's puppet . 
   instead you even stopped \u00c5land from joining sweden !, 
  ummm ... sorry about that ? 
   poland which has considerably fresher wounds than finland . 
  the winter war still has n't been forgotten , and russia/soviet union held a gun next to our head for almost half a century . 
  furthermore finns have n't really interacted with russians that much ( for example russian has never been widely spoken here ) , so most finns are very ignorant about russia . 
  do they spend billions ( around 10 billion i think ) every year in useless agricultural subsidies and ~ ~ pork-barrel ~ ~ * `` regional development programs '' * while simultaneously cutting from education and r&d ? 
  do they also think that brewing pulp ( or whatever [ `` sellun keitto '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulp_mill ) is in english ) and other low-tech industries are a good foundation to a first world economy ? 
  i doubt that they could do worse even if they tried . 
  oh well , we may find out if the worst comes to worst . 
  hey !, 
  no wood , no ikea furniture !, 
  sorry but we are kinda used to being independent . 
  however if our government keeps screwing things up you may get a change to buy us back . 
  no i 'm pretty sure much of it is genuine , or at least that is my understanding . 
  i have encountered people with rather strong opinions about russia . 
   same noises they make about sweden and estonia . 
  i do n't know anyone who hates estonia , neither in a serious or in a light-hearted manner ( but then again i 'm from western finland and we do n't really deal with them ) . 
  russia is the only country finns genuinely hate . 
  disclaimer : i do n't personally hate russia or russians , i 'm actually fairly apathetic as far as personal feelings are concerned . 
  just telling what is , as far as i know , the common feeling among my coyntrymen . 
  regular people always have had a negative view on russia . 
  it is our politicians and intellectuals who always had this weird hard on for russia ( or soviet union ) . 
  ironically we got rid of you by accident . 
   your country would never join nato . 
  sweden already has very deep ties to nato , in fact sweden is sometimes considered to be an `` unofficial '' member of nato . 
   losing finland why , i 'm almost flattered !, 
   why did n't finland join sweden again [ actually we almost did , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/3uzy7j/til_finland_proposed_to_sweden_in_1940_that_the/ ) however you swedes said ` no ' because you were afraid of germany and soviet union . 
  we actually did have [ intelligence cooperation with americans ] ( http://www.kaleva.fi/mielipide/vieras/suomen-salaiset-ja-vaaralliset-lansisuhteet/182972/ ) ( [ in google-engrish ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kaleva.fi%2fmielipide%2fvieras%2fsuomen-salaiset-ja-vaaralliset-lansisuhteet%2f182972%2f&amp;edit-text= ) ) , and probably with swedes as well .
