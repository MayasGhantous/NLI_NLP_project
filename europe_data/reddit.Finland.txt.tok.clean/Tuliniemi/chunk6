   and holy fuck , finland is dark , for a country that is neutral . 
  we were neutral , not because we love russia or something , but because it was the only way to preserve our independence since we could n't resist openly . 
  after the soviet union collapsed we quickly joined the eu and the eurozone ( yes , the membership of eurozone is a form defense policy ) , and since then we have n't bought a single major weapon system from russia . 
  [ also our military trains with nato on a regular basis ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/16_finnish_jets_join_nato-dominated_exercise_over_lapland/7976788 ) , while ( at least to my knowledge ) we have n't had a single exercise with russia . 
   but finland , a non-nato country for example , the worst ? 
  then your knowledge of finland is clearly lacking . 
  finns in general have no love for russia . 
  so poles like pigs ? 
   nice mixture of old and modern , i actually kinda prefer the old building . 
  sorry , but i think we have become addicted to [ freedom !, 
  ] ( http://www.airforce-technology.com/news/newsus-to-supply-agm-158-jassm-for-finland ), 
  i do n't see any real alternatives to f-35 . 
  i highly doubt that 4th generation aircrafts are going to cut it against pakfa . 
  if f-35 is unaffordable or unavailable or whatever i think we should go for the jas-39 ng , since the swedes need this deal more than we do , which means we may be able to milk economic concessions out of them . 
  hey , freedom ai n't free and so on !, 
  especially when you are not in nato . 
  what makes sweden better than finland ? 
  their eastern neighbour !, 
  there is an `` easy '' solution to our problems : [ just restore the old borders !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_n%c3%b6teborg#/media/file:treaty-of-n%c3%b6teborg.png ) i 'm only half serious . 
  almost all of the value in the country is created below that line and we are wasting billions every year in ultimately futile pork barrel policies and agricultural subsidies , because people are , and have been , moving to south ( oulu being the exception ) in droves . 
  we could easily save a billion with better urban policies and by slashing agricultural subsidies . 
  but no , instead our government is cutting education and r&d funding , because who needs high tech products when you have potatoes ? 
  no worries , and you are kinda right actually . 
  while regular finns may hate russia , many of our politicians and ` intellectuals ' do seem to love russia for some reason . 
  our ex-president tarja halonen for example .

  well your [ air force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_air_force ) and [ navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_navy ) are better than ours . 
  due to brainwashing from `` finlandization '' - era there are still loads of people in finland with rather strong anti-western , and especially anti-american , views . 
  i wonder if any of these people realize they are just `` useful idiots '' ? 
  sometimes i have absolutely no idea what the hell my fellow countrymen are thinking . 
  finnish attitude in a nutshell : '' [ waah !, 
  no-one helped us during the winter war !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_support_of_finland_in_the_winter_war ) '' and now : `` lol noobz !, 
  we no need help you !, 
  with that attitude do n't expect anyone to help us , i mean how is isolating ourselves by burning bridges going to help us ? 
  so you would have preferred the alternative ? 
  you would have preferred if they had n't allowed us to trade freely ? 
  you would have preferred if they had n't acknowledged our neutrality ? 
   americanophilia is almost as disgusting as russophilia . 
  you know what else is disgusting ? 
  irrational americanophobia and russophobia !, 
  look i 'm not one of those people who claim americans are angels of virtue or something , but they are n't devils either . 
  edit : oh , and i would n't call having a modern electronics industry `` useless '' . 
  where do you think we got our first transistors from ? 
  they do n't exactly grow in trees . 
   who 's talking anything about holding any grudges ? 
  well not you specifically , but anti-american sentiments are n't exactly uncommon in finland . 
   oh sure , probably all of it was earmarked `` not to be used against finland . '', 
  of course not , but that does n't mean we should blame americans for that . 
   point being : there is no reason to have resentment or gratitude towards us , not one way or the other . 
  [ hannu rautkallio seems to have a different opinion . 
   ... yeah , just forget about us supplying ussr with the lend-lease program in 1941-45 . 
  the aim of the lend-lease was to support soviet union to defeat nazi germany , they were n't specifically aimed at us . 
  and it was n't america 's fault that we ended up siding with the nazis , it was fault of both nazi germany and soviet union ( [ user crejcrej provided an excellent explanation of this on another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/3uzy7j/til_finland_proposed_to_sweden_in_1940_that_the/cxjeues ) ) . 
  i see no reason why we should hold a grudge against us . 
   the americans would 've nuked us during the cold war to deny the area to the soviets . 
  and ? 
  so would have the soviets ( or `` our good friends '' according to the leftists ) and so would have the swedes if they had built those nukes they were planning to . 
  during the cold war were in a really tough spot , and we should be grateful for any help we got . 
  or would you have preferred if finland had been on the other side of the iron curtain ? 
  after all finland was n't that important country , and to prevent any transfer of technologies to soviet union american could have easily said : `` lol no transistors or microchips for you ! '', 
  instead they allowed us to trade more-or-less freely . 
  [ does everyone have their candles ready ?

  he is just stating his opinion . 
  it 's not like he is raping a cat . 
  even if us played a small role , it does n't change the fact that they helped us . 
  so i see no justification for the condescending attitude . 
  hurray !, 
  why are you being downvoted ? 
   if we should thank anyone it 's the germans you mean the germans who sold us to soviet union with [ molotov-ribbentrop pact ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) no offense but the germans were just using us . 
  actually america supported us ( at least indirectly ) during the cold war , for example they allowed us to purchase western technologies and without them finland would be a `` northern uzbekistan '' . 
  `` in this figure finland was marginalized , but its survival as an independent , democratic state was on the american agenda . '', 
  this . 
  i really wish our `` concerned citizens '' would use just half of the energy they spend on raving about the muslims in sweden to actually helping our country . 
   finland takes in like 5 migrants a year , your knowledge is obsolete : this year alone we have taken in over 30k refugees , and they are going to cost us 843 million $ next year . 
   edit - oops looks like i got downvoted even when providing sources . 
  i guess people just do n't want to know . 
  i upvoted , and thanks for the sources .

   that 's insanely strong for sweden and it 's surprising how the gap between finland and sweden seems to be getting larger and larger .
