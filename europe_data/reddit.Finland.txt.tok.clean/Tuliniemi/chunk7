  it 's not actually that surprising if you know few things about finland . 
  here are some key differences : - sweden has n't been dependent on single company ( nokia ) - sweden 's third largest trading partner has n't collapsed - the division between workers and employers is n't as deep as it is in finland , and because of this sweden has been able to reform it 's labor market . 
  also while there were [ 143 strikes in finland last year , sweden had just 5 strikes ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1448599974886.html ) - sweden is more business and entrepreneur friendly . 
  in finland there are still plenty of people with ddr-mindset . 
  - sweden does n't waste billions every year in useless agricultural subsidies and pork-barrel policies, 
  congratulations sweden . 
  i 'm starting to think that [ this is a good idea ] ( http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2009/04/20/lapinlahden-linnut-uusi-suomen-kartta#media=38860 )  the video is in finnish but the meaning of it should be obvious . 
   actually those `` smes '' are subcontractors to auto makers . 
  autos are by far the most important part of germany 's exports . 
  true , but smes still play an important role in germany 's economy . 
  and i do believe that smes are one of the areas where our economy can grow . 
  according to kauppalehti [ smes make up only 3 % of our exports , while in sweden the number is 13 % . 
  [ they used be , but their popularity has basically collapsed ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/yle_poll_shows_steep_drop_in_finns_party_support/8365117 ) . 
  who would have known that it takes more to run a government than just running your mouth and making promises ? 
  you know what is ironic ? 
  some swedish journalist complained how we finns are cowards for letting the finns party in our government . 
  while the incidents you mentioned were shady at best an undeniable fact still is that finland is relatively corrupt free country on global scale . 
  sure , finland has very little corruption when compared to russia or nigeria , but that does n't mean we should ignore corruption . 
  the real issue in finland is that too often cases like those mentioned are just swept under the rug . 
  furthermore while there is very little corruption in day-to-day life , i believe there is more corruption at the very top of our society . 
  surely you are familiar with the term `` good ol' boys network '' ? 
  now how do i know this ? 
  well actually i do n't , because very few studies have been done on this subject . 
   this is part of the narrative provided by the current conservative-right government and big business that is exactly correct , the current situation benefits big businesses . 
  but i was talking about smes , not big businesses . 
  the tragedy is that no one is currently defending small businesses : to some people there is no difference between the two . 
  [ just read the comments of this news article . 
  ] ( http://www.uusisuomi.fi/raha/140726-yrittajan-kova-avautuminen-ay-liikkeelle-sanon-nyt-aaneen-sen-mita-moni-ei-uskalla?ref=suosituimmat )  but if you start to actually compare facts you find that for example it is way cheaper to get rid of a finnish worker than a german one . 
  it is true firing workers is very easy in finland , but hiring is much more difficult especially if you are small-business owner . 
  meh this person is looking at finland through rose-tinted glasses . 
   or corrupt , this is so true !, 
  there is absolutely no corruption in finland !, 
  for example : suvi lind\u00e9n 's golf course , vanhanen ' `` lautakasa '' and himanen 's `` blue book '' are legitimate businesses !, 
   super-flexibility , wut ? 
  i take it that the writer of this article has n't run a sme-business in our country . 
  for example , finland 's labor markets are notoriously inflexible . 
   sweden was able to navigate similar shocks by letting its currency take the strain at key moments over the last decade . 
  swedish gdp is now 8pc above its pre-lehman level . 
  sweden also has a far more dynamic and diverse economy , partly because they did n't have [ far left jerks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taistoism ) terrorizing business owners and [ `` politically incorrect people '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tauno_tiusanen ) . 
  for decades entrepreneurship was witchcraft and devilry . 
  and sweden does n't waste billions every in agricultural subsidies and pork barrel policies , while simultaneously cutting from education and r&d . was joining the eurozone a mistake ? 
  maybe , but that does n't change the fact that it is us finns who are ultimately responsible for our country , and the inconvenient truth is that there is a lot wrong with our country . 
  what is so wrong about finland you ask ? 
  well that is a long story , but i have two book recommendations for those who can read finnish : `` narutettu sukupolvi '' by [ tauno tiusanen ] ( http://liberalismi.net/wiki/tauno_tiusanen ) and `` lumedemokratia '' [ here is a decent english synopsis ] ( http://www.martenscentre.eu/publications/quasi-democracy-finlands-fall-cradle-innovation-abyss-stagnation ) however things are slowly starting to get better , i 'm sure we will get back on our feet . 
  i suppose it is not , as long as you do n't expect anyone to help during your time of need . 
  like how we finns always bitch and whine how everyone left us alone during the winter war . 
  i hope they will change it quickly , this is so shameful . 
  i 'm so sorry france . 
  :( seriously fuck our useless politicians !, 
  meh , i like to be original . 
  namely networks and radio-tech . 
  they also have a sizeable patent portfolio and they used to have here-maps which they sold to german car makers . 
  they also seem to be interested in [ virtual reality ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/ozo-camera-breaks-new-ground-virtual-reality-post-microsoft-nokia-2046842 ) . 
   talking to a kgb does n't mean anything [ that is putting it mildly . 
  ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/paavo_v%c3%a4yrynen#kohu.2c_kritiikki_ja_keskustelu ) in a proper western country v\u00e4yrynen would have been kicked out of politics long time ago . 
  in fact most of our cold war era politicians should have been kicked out . 
  for whatever reason we , unlike other eastern european countries , have n't done our post-soviet laundry . 
  you pretty much nailed it , though calling v\u00e4yrysk\u00e4 a `` weird chick '' is putting it mildly . 
  did you read the part about kgb ? 
   center party representative whom everybody dislikes then who keeps voting for him ? 
  why ? 
  he is our very own eternal presidential candidate !, 
  i guess i should brush up my swedish then . 
  good enough ? 
   `` very interesting since it 's the euro that keeps finland from recovering . '', 
  actually i think it is our very own stupidity that is keeping us from recovering : - for a decade nokia was our holy cow and it was illegal to criticize it - we deepened our trade relations with russia despite obvious risks , and ignored other potential markets like poland , brazil and usa - we have hindered smes and startups with excessive regulations and taxes - we have very poor urban development policies - our agricultural subsidies are ridiculously excessive ( around 2.5 billion $ every year ) you know ... sometimes , in my weaker moments , i wonder would it be so bad if stockholm was our capital ? 
  sure they were jerks who stole our tar but at least they did n't wear pants on their heads . 
  in all seriousness though there are some positive signs , for example entrepreneurship is becoming increasingly popular . 
  in recent years hundreds of new startups and smes have created all around the country , and the people involved in the scene are becoming increasingly competent . 
  prehistoric fossils like v\u00e4yrynen will eventually retire and be replaced by younger , and hopefully by more fresher , politicians . 
  ... ... ... eventually . 
  ship building : meyer , abb and w\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 . 
  sure , you will complain that the first two are n't our companies . 
  but so what ? 
  the important thing is that they have operations here and employ people . 
  health tech : planmeca and polar electro radio tech : nokia nano tech : picosun software : well maybe i was a bit too optimistic on this one , since we do n't have anything like google . 
  but we have managed to create a decent number of small but innovative companies . 
  you have done very well for yourself if you had founded say stonesoft , hantro or codenomicon . 
  look i 'm not claiming that everything is wunderbar , but now is not the time for typical finnish pessimism and melancholy . 
  for the last two decades our entire tech industry , and almost rest of the economy , was dominated by a single company and it was n't a good thing for us . 
  now we 'll just have to build something new . 
  just ask [ keith silverang ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/tyoelama/art-1288646372712.html ), 
  are you talking about smes or startups ? 
  smes are great because they create jobs and there are tons of them . 
  people always think of cars when think about german economy , but the actual driving force behind german economy is their army of smes . 
  with luck , we may eventually have our own . 
  startups are great because they create new rich people , and yes this is a good thing because some of them will become business angels . 
  take ilkka paananen for example . 
  after acquiring millions from the supercell deal , he founded ( or co-founded ) [ lifeline ventures ] ( http://www.lifelineventures.com/ ) . 
  oh do n't be so pessimistic , we are competitive in many areas ranging from healthtech to shipbuilding to radiotech to nanotech to software . 
  we just have to develop a healthy self-esteem and bravely build a new future . 
  i 'm sure we will learn marketing as well . 
  `` would you have suggested to devalue the fim even more through currency interventions ? '', 
  i do n't personally think we should leave euro , but i do n't think anyone is suggesting that we should intentionally devalue our hypothetical currency . 
  instead the usual argument is that a free-floating currency would make it easier for a us to adjust our economy . 
  not my opinion though . 
  we did the same mistake with russia . 
  yes , in theory at least . 
  markka or squirrel skin or whatever would probably lose value against euro which would make our exports cheaper . 
  the big problem however is that loans and mortgages are nominated in euros , so the interest rates would rise if our currency was to lose value against euro .
