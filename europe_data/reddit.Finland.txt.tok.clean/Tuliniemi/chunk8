  we finns always complain how everyone left us alone during the winter war , but yet we are unwilling to help others . 
  how about we search for new trading partners ? 
  like poland or ` murica or something . 
  actually america is now a larger export partner to us than russia , and a large chunk of our exports to russia have been re-exports , so it is not that bad . 
  vii spiik inlish veri kut !, 
   do you mean domestic as `` inside the country '' or as `` inside home '' ? 
  inside the country , as i said swedish is taught as a second domestic language ( toinen kotimainen ) and not as a foreign language ( vieras kieli ) like english for example . 
  i do n't why but that 's the law . 
   and in practice is what this statistic is all about . 
  well in that case it should be counted as a foreign language . 
   for other finns , swedish is a foreign language yes in practice but officially swedish is the second domestic language , so finns do not study swedish as a foreign language but as * `` second domestic/native '' * ( toinen kotimainen ) . 
  no but * officially * swedish , and finnish , are considered to be native languages . 
  so for a finnish speaker swedish is not officially a foreign language . 
  do n't ask me why , i do n't make these rules . 
  i 'm swedish but it 's scary how little news we read about finland , very sad . 
  there are swedish news in finland if you are interested . 
   but i remember somewhere that i read that the sannfinl\u00e4ndarna ( swedish spelling of it ) party wanted to remove swedish or so ? 
  yes they did , however other parties did n't agree with it and their popularity has collapsed since then . 
  actually swedish is a * '' [ toinen kotimainen ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/toinen_kotimainen_kieli ) '' * i.e. 
  second native language so it 's not officially a foreign language . 
  that we are mongols from central asia or something .

   seriously why is there big deviation from other nordic countries ? 
  well for starters nokia lost its phone business and the paper industry has been on decline , and there are plenty of other issues . 
  it would be really really hard to cover the airspace size of russia with air defense systems . 
  now someone has to ride that thing like a jackass . 
   it 's generally considered the best of the 4.5 generation fighters really ? 
  i 'm definitely not an expert but i have always been under impression that the rafale is better . 
  the typhoon still does n't have an aesa radar and the rafale performed better in [ swiss evaluation ] ( https://www.scribd.com/doc/81390363/swiss-air-force-confidential-report-on-the-evaluation-of-the-eurofighter-the-gripen-ng-and-the-rafale ) . 
  tallinn is ahead of helsinki ?

  aster 30 is used by several countries so i 'm not sure if it 's correct to assume that everything france makes is awful . 
  also the reason we did n't buy it because it was too expensive . 
  * `` we bought 5 volvos instead of a one cadillac . 
  well they did , in a way , save our shipbuilding industry by making deal with [ meyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meyer_turku ) so they are n't * completely * useless . 
  and one should keep in mind that it was n't our politicians who created the nokia so we even should n't expect them to save our economy . 
   the problem with the aa systems is that the better ones are only sold to nato members was n't the [ samp/t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aster_ ( missile_family \\ ) ) offered to finland ? 
  ... better than [ kepu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_ ( finland \\ ) ) . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mgm-140_atacms finland is not buying [ the atacms ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/paper_finland_cancels_us_missile_deal/7162963 ) , we do however have the [ agm-158 jassm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-158_jassm ) . 
   the f-35 is literally too expensive to buy for the air force . 
  it 's apparently cheaper than the rafale and the typhoon and it may end up not being significantly more expensive than the jas 39e while being far more capable . 
   if we managed to find money somewhere , in which we do n't . 
  we bought f-18s in early 90ies and back then [ our economy was in deep shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_1990s_depression_in_finland ) . 
  i do n't see a reason why we ca n't afford to buy new fighters if we were able to afford back then . 
  we are also going to spend over a billion to [ buy new corvettes ] ( https://corporalfrisk.com/2015/09/26/mtalaivue-2020-who-forgot-the-marketing/ ) . 
   and they are not going to sell us the f-35 , period . 
  then why did they decide to respond to the rfi concerning the f-35 while they declined the f-15 and the f-16 ? 
   the article you linked did n't even specifically say that they were trying to market on finland . 
  [ they are . 
  ] ( https://corporalfrisk.com/2016/06/21/the-grey-ghost/comment-page-1/ )  it would actually might be a risk to sell the new 5th generation stealth fighter to finland considering our proximity to the russian border and possible espionage attempts . 
  finland was able to buy f-18s along with the latest avionics and weapons ( amraams and sidewinders ) just after the soviet union had collapsed , and back then we were n't part of the eu and we were n't a nato partner . 
  also they have been willing to sell other advanced weapons to us like the jassm missile . 
   that are only built for a specific purpose . 
  and what is that purpose ? 
  the main reason we are buying new aircraft is not to bomb democracy into third world countries armed with obsolete weapons but to defend our airspace from an opponent with good air defense systems and a good air force . 
  the f-35 will be the most survivable multi-role aircraft in such environment since that 's what it 's designed to do . 
   but finland is n't really in any formal relationship with the us to get an advanced plane as the f-35 , [ f-35 and superbug ] ( http://airheadsfly.com/2016/05/02/us-will-not-offer-f-15-and-f-16-to-finland/ ) have been offered to finland while f-15 and f-16 have n't been offered . 
  finland was one of the first foreign countries to receive advanced [ jassm ] ( http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/finland-to-buy-cruise-missiles-for-its-hornets-05370/ ) cruise missile so our relations with americans ca n't be that bad . 
   i also doubt that we would buy them due to their cost all modern fighters are expensive and if [ lockmart is correct about f-35 's declining cost ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2016/02/bogdan-predicts-f-35s-for-less-than-80m-engines-included/ ) then it may end up being cheaper than rafale or eurofighter . 
   limited application for our defense strategy . 
  then why do we have fighters in the first place ? 
  eh they do n't seem to like me . 
  my strongest memory of sweden was when me and my swedish cousin were beating the crap out of each other when we were kids . 
  i feel the same way and now that i think about it almost all of my friends are foreigners and immigrants . 
  because : * i do n't like metal and it gives me a headache , i prefer something cheerful like pop * i do n't care about hockey , squash and football for me !, 
  * i do n't care about the 95 hockey gold medal * i have never seen the `` tuntematon sotilas '' and i do n't care about the winter war * i do n't like alcohol , at most i may have a glass of wine every now and then * i 'm not depressed * i do n't mind small talk * i 'm not really that fond of saunas * i do n't really hate sweden * i have both swedish given - and surnames * i do n't really fit either [ fennomanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) or [ svecomanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svecoman_movement ) identities * oh and i do n't care about [ mannerheim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) , [ st\u00e5hlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaarlo_juho_st%c3%a5hlberg ) is my hero . 
  yes but there has never been anything official as far as i know and talk is cheap . 
  i think sweden will eventually decide to join nato with or without finland and i hope our politicians are on the ball then . 
   people and books dont get along these days . 
  i guess it 's too much effort to read lots of words . 
  shame . 
  i 'm actually planning to read the * witcher * books right after i have done with the * a song of ice and fire * books .
