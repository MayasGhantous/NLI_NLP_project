  if finland can make win-win deals with germany and other western countries then why ca n't ukraine ? 
   surely you are not saying that finland is validly nordic because it has swedish loanwords and historically swedish regions ? 
  no the reason finland is a nordic country is because the nordic countries were the only western group open to us during the cold war and we were lucky enough to avoid occupation by soviet union . 
   firstly , finland did n't dare to recognize our restored independence before several other european countries , including sweden . 
  i do n't want to make excuses but finland did support estonia behind the scenes . 
   what important nordic influences has this brought to finnish culture , specifically ? 
  there are loads of swedish loanwords in finnish and there were even more before the de-swedification by the [ fennomania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoman_movement ) movement , and some parts of finland have traditionally been more `` swedish '' than `` finnish '' . 
  what 's the deal with northern sweden ? 
  no sauna no good . 
  yeah , and also the [ keilaniemi towers ] ( http://www.lansivayla.fi/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/documentimages/20786262.jpg?itok=swhyaoys ) in espoo . 
  finland is next to denmark and lapland . 
  yeah our vodka tourists are the beacons of civilization ... 
   when did reddit think finland was a super power ? 
  never , but unfortunately plenty of finns ( and especially the uneducated rednecks ) have a rather inflated ego when it comes to defense . 
  fortunately those people are n't the ones making the decisions here . 
  also japan , taiwan and singapore , the asian ( well at least some of them ) countries have done really well . 
  i would love to see more wooden architecture here . 
  things have been pretty bad during the last few years , but there are things i 'm genuinely excited about like the strong urbanization trend and our `` entrepreneurial renaissance '' . 
  and the west-coast where i 'm from has so far fared better than most other parts of our country . 
  so i 'm cautiously optimistic , though i 'm worried about our officials who seem to be incapable of doing anything useful most of the time . 
  i might have a different opinion i was for example from eastern finland . 
   russian exports due to sanctions finland 's trade with russia has collapsed mainly because of russia 's economic problems , [ source in finnish ] ( http://www.hs.fi/talous/a1460520098543 ) . 
   not too easy to find positive economic news . 
  finland is undergoing a drastic structural change that may last for years but things could be far worse . 
  same here in finland : [ finland , home of the $ 103,000 speeding ticket ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/ ), 
   pretty surprised that finland and sweden rank highly should n't be a surprise to anyone who 's familiar with the country . 
  the idea of fighting against invaders is basically part of our national character . 
   germany in the winter war how did germany help finland during the winter war ? 
  they are the ones who gave us to soviet union with molotov-ribbentrop pact and germany blocked several countries from aiding us . 
   if they had just let the reds win from the get go yeah sure , i mean soviet style socialism worked great for eastern european countries ... not !, 
  so why the hell would we have done that ? 
   social fascists in government what ? 
  finland had a democratically elected government before the winter war and the radical right wing movements ( like [ lapua movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) ) had mostly been suppressed when the winter war began . 
  and what is social fascist anyway ? 
  [ 7 bridges archipelago ] ( http://www.7siltaa.com/ostrobothnia_tourism.html ) between kokkola and jakobstad especially during the [ venetian festivals ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/veneziansk_afton ) in the late august . 
  the scenery looks beautiful with hundreds of candles burning at the shores and with fireworks going off . 
  other archipelagos , for example the ones around turku and vaasa , in finland are also worth of visiting . 
  finlandization and our civil war . 
  there are successful gaming companies , like blizzard valve and ea , so is there a reason why a mobile game companies ca n't succeed in long term ? 
  maybe the industry is just maturing . 
  however i do agree with you , fortunately we do have other industries like maritime cluster and health tech . 
  they are still based here and pay taxes here . 
   fundamentally , their populations are not less competitive than ours , but we have monetary independence . 
  you also have a more diverse economy and russia 's collapse did n't hurt you nearly as bad as it did us . 
  you are also more urbanized and you do n't waste billions every year trying to hinder the natural urbanization trend , and you are at least 10 years ahead of us in entrepreneurship . 
  people always talk about how the euro is damaging our economy but no one ever mentions our own failures . 
  ca n't comment on denmark . 
  did n't know that we spend that much , not that i 'm complaining . 
   finland , you should give norway some mountains instead . 
  we have mountains ? 
  people actually wore those things ?

  good thing that my nieces are growing up as `` tv\u00e5spr\u00e5kig '' so they are going to be save .

   the interconnector aims to end finland 's heavy energy dependence from russia , which has been the country 's single natural gas exporter since 1974 . 
  true , but natural gas only accounts for 10 % of total energy consumption afaik . 
  however this is great news !, 
  [ finnish complaints choir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atxv3dzkv68 ) [ explanation by wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complaints_choir ), 
  that actually looks quite nice . 
  i hope the three little pigs are wise enough to build their homes with bricks . 
  i have never heard of those people . 
  i ca n't really say anything about that but from what i read ( briefly ) the situation does n't seem to apply here . 
  so are we sill going to have mandatory swedish ? 
   estonia almost nobody would consider a child of two russian parents an ethnic estonian , no matter how well he or she speaks estonian the situation is not comparable . 
  in my home region ( kokkola region ) there have been finns and swedes living together for the last 800 years or so and historically ( like centuries ago and before modern nationalism ) people here felt closer to swedes than to say karelians whom both finns and swedes saw as outsiders or even as enemies . 
   we 'll even claim that we 're the hard workers . 
  is it just me or do all people seem to think that * they * are the hard working ones ? 
   that means they are finnicized swedes really ? 
  i have never thought it that way . 
  we ( well at least me and my relatives ) have always seen ourselves as finns , sure we may have a stronger connection to sweden than most people and some of us speak swedish natively but we have always been finns . 
  finnishness is not monolithic entity there are many different aspects of it . 
   however why would one draw the nordic-not nordic border between estonia and finland i ca n't answer that , but who knows maybe estonia would be a nordic country if it had n't been occupied by soviet union . 
  and it 's entirely possible that finland would n't be a nordic country if soviet union had n't been hostile towards us . 
   all finns are finnic , how do you not get this ? 
  for example there are people here in finland , and especially here in west coast , who are more `` swedish '' than `` finnish '' despite the fact that they are native finnish speakers . 
  of course one can argue that all finnish speakers are finnic but at least for me that feels completely arbitrary . 
  does it mean that my friend who was raised as an english speaker is more english than finnish ? 
  but of course this all depends on what you mean by finns since we are not a monolithic hive mind . 
   and estonia shares many of the same swedish influences . 
  is that true ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying that you are incorrect since i do n't actually know much about estonia ( a fact that i 'm not proud of ) , but it would surprise me if estonia has been influenced by sweden as much as finland has been . 
  for example people in my native region did n't even speak finnish before the rise of finnish nationalism , instead they spoke `` swennish '' and my older relatives ( and occasionally my parents ) use words like [ * `` h\u00e4st '' * ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/51nhtw9exnl._sx355_.jpg ) [ * `` kaffel '' * ] ( http://pngimg.com/upload/fork_png3062.png ) and [ * `` hanttuki '' * ] ( http://www.supercat.se/shop/14698/art98/h6406/19896406-origpic-68f244.jpg ) . 
   estonia is just as finnic as finland , so why should n't estonia be considered a nordic country ? 
   estonia is just as finnic as finland well finland is considered to be a nordic country because of the strong swedish influences in our society and culture and not because we are finnic . 
  furthermore not all finns are finnic . 
   i mean , if someone called you germanic , would n't you correct them ? 
  i would n't care too much , i do n't believe that people should be forced into arbitrarily defined groups . 
   i do n't see the insecurity i 'm sorry but that 's how it came across , at least for me . 
  but maybe it 's just me since i 'm throwing stones from a glass house . 
   and estonia is widely identified as a very tech-savvy nation already , so we 've got that going for us !, 
  keep up the good work . 
  you know , i have always admired how you have handled your post-soviet homework , while we have n't done ours . 
  do you estonians actually care about that ? 
  no offense but the insecurity is n't charming . 
  few decades ago it was commonly assumed that finland was a communistic eastern bloc country , however that perception has changed ( not that finland is a well known county ) thanks to rise of nokia and other progress we have made . 
  if you are so worried about how foreigners perceive you then create something people can identify you with . 
  like [ start a band ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abba ) or learn how to play [ football ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iceland_national_football_team ) . 
  and we no longer make cellphones .
