are these set up situations ? 
  looks like it from the shouts in the beginning of some videos . 
  so kansallinen kokoomus then ? 
  assuming this is made for americans , every other party would be on the left ? 
  still expensive as hell . 
  i would pay 15 eur tops for guidebook . 
  we could finance it , but our drama imo sucks ass big time . 
  finnish police series is a joke , so as long you provide the actors and writers . 
  or crime series copied from denmark/sweden ? 
  btw , i am 110 % backing the helsinki-tallinn tunnel . 
  i would like to see more/any skyscrapers in helsinki . 
  i love modernism , glass and metal buildings . 
  one of the reasons i like rotterdam so much . 
  in finnish it 's used quite often , [ * keski-eurooppa * ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/keski-eurooppa ) . 
  but people have variable definitions for it . 
  but still no estonia ? 
  yes , i tought the initial question was something along the lines of `` why france is allowed to have colonies if portugal is n't ? '', 
  did n't portugal gave their dependencies away voluntarily ? 
  also , you can say wahtever you want in translation , no-one is n't going to check . 
  eli5 , why migrants want to go to uk ? 
  why france is n't good enough ? 
  especially if you are from french speaking africa . 
  are n't we pretty tight already ? 
  travel without passport and move to another country almost like you can move within one country . 
  ( you need to register with local authority but that 's all ) . 
  how does it make harder to keep illegal immigrants out ? 
  if they got no schengen visa , you throw them out , no ? 
  i understand that the lack of passport controls at the border would make it harder to spot illegals though . 
  well , i would say that any administrative centre can be used as a scapegoat , and the rest of country blames it for any mistake ? 
  `` the economy of lappi is failing , and it 's the fault of the morons sitting in helsinki and not giving a shit ! '', 
  a quick test shows that forex is cheaper . 
  sell 10 $ = 6.91 #, 
  basically you could , from tallinn to st. petersburg , and allegro to helsinki . 
  might be able to do that in one day . 
  but why would you ? 
  hah , what you know about coldness , you live in south . 
  well the mayor of helsinki , jussi pajunen pre-approved this , if i remember right . 
  i recall there were talks about funding of the tunnel with private money , like with channel tunnel ? 
  but nevertheless rail baltica is happening , and if i 'm not able go to berlin from my home city , i could take a ferry to tallinn and train from there . 
  it is already in planning , if you can call rail baltica and tallinn-helsinki rail tunnel hst . 
  i sincerely hope i could take a train to berlin someday . 
  truly unlimited , at least with saunalahti . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  til people in estonia thinks we are fat . 
  ` murica of the north . 
  they were , also the official number instructions were in the booth, 
  karhu is somewhat tolerable , lapin kulta and koff are the worst imo . 
  ( there might be some good beers from small breweries that i have n't heard of . ), 
  well there goes that theory . 
  h\u00e4kkil\u00e4 says in iltalehti that he used the proper way to write the number 7 . 
  the candidate 's number was 57 . 
  they maybe just forgot the second vertical line from the number seven , and the ballot ( s ) got voided ? 
  even if i trust finnish voting system , i 'd want to start investigation too . 
  any beer that is n't from my country . 
  i prefer heineken or guinness . 
  what do you mean stop . 
  they tried to teach it to me at school , five years later ja kan inte spr\u00e5k svensk , or something like that . 
  maybe it was just a teenage rebellion . 
  `` uus p\u00f5hjamaa '' , like new [ bothnia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrobothnia_ ( region ) ) ? 
   gripen no thanks , i choose life . 
  happy europe day to everyone !, 
  glad europa dag til alle !, 
  some translations could be wrong , used google translate nearly for all the languages . 
  i found [ this ] ( http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2271/1933393674_75fde35f4e.jpg ) . 
  it 's a soviet poster trying to get russians drink less . 
  there is an reservation fee in long distance trains ? 
  last time i was in germany , i simply hopped in to ice from berlin to m\u00fcnchen , but i was using interrail pass , so maybe it 's different . 
  also , vr has straight competition with buses ( matkahuolto , finnish associate of many bus companies . 
  and recently low-cost onnibus ) . 
  but do they care about competition ? 
  no , instead they changed the pricing from e/km to airline type pricing ( it 's cheaper to buy tickets few weeks in advance and price depends on the demand . 
  ) , which increased the prices . 
  you can be in a different country within 2 hours by car in europe . 
  finnish vr is above the mighty db ? 
  whaat ? 
  ca n't be real . 
  opened the link and saw distribution restriction statement that it shall not be distributed outside dod . 
  how screwed am i ? 
  they were made by nokia , so practically indestructible , hehheh . 
  the nokia rubber was a different company before 2001 . 
  i 'm using my own in painting jobs . 
  with original filters ofc . 
  no sickness yet . 
  am i seeing lots of [ finnish m/61 gas masks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m61_gas_mask ) ? 
  yayyy finnish exports in use !, 
  yes , but it looks imo kinda funny when road signs here says `` sairaala , sjukhus '' . 
  i agree , if there is federal europe someday , i want to its language to be english . 
  i always mix up sjukhus and suihku ( shower ) , they look so similar . 
  can you beat me ? 
  lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliupseerioppilas and yes , same thing in finnish , you could add words to make endless combinations btw , i like hearing icelandic , i like the odd sounds when pronouncing things :d . that 's what i like in danish and dutch too . 
  we would just flee with russia , [ like last time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diet_of_porvoo ) . 
  they promised autonomy and own parliament . 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  thanks !, 
  maybe i 'll apply for a e-residency then , would be maybe cheaper to use estonian debit card next time i am in tallinn :d . 
  the article says that with e-residency , you can open estonian bank account ? 
  is there such advantages for me , or can i , as a eu-citizen , open bank accounts in other eu countries without any kind of e-residency things ? 
  [ meanwhile in sweden ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg ), 
  huh ? 
  that 's the best synthesizer i 've ever heard .
