  still , for the finnish service provider this would mean a heftier bill from the foreign partnering operator , and in the end those extra costs are gon na slide down into our prices . 
  a little late to the party but came to say that this new roaming bill sucks for finns . 
  we use data more than most , more the probably anyone . 
  so the prices have gone down to sub-30 $ for unlimited . 
  now , if a finn were to visit say germany they would obviously get to use data unlimited just like in finland but since it costs more there the german network operator will send the huge bill to their finnish service provider . 
  who ends up paying for the extra ? 
  the customer . 
  the law states that they ca n't just throw the extra to that customer so what will end up happening is that they will ever so slightly raise the charges on everything and for everyone . 
  all the major mobile network providers in finland also sell regular internet connections . 
  we have nokia , one of the leading telecom manufacturers in the world . 
  it is in their interest to test their cutting edge tech in finland . 
  large amount of mobile phones , usage is `` modern '' , meaning that people use data a lot and have the newest devices on hand , and the towns of 100k-600k people allow to get good coverage with just a few towers . 
  finnish government is also very proactive on making sure the network infrastructure is keeping up with the device technology . 
  not sure how people in other eu-states use their phones , but here data is king . 
  no , less is more here . 
  sober finns most definitely ramp up the climate change . 
  drunk finns stay home and booze up in underwear . 
  it 's better for the world and climate change if finns are kept nice and tipsy . 
  make finns drunk again mfda does n't really roll off the tongue like the other ones . 
  we take one for the team . 
  got ta give the world those sweet metal tunes . 
  maybe the first one is the answer to the second one , and vice versa . 
  not that i particularly would n't want to be in nato . 
  or particularly happy . 
  they might question your status as a country , but our whole country 's existence has been questioned . 
  so you have it easy  guys , finland probably exists . 
  it is thought thru twitter with memes . 
  damn , macron is the coolest president ever . 
  thank you france . 
  i hope this is the new norm . 
  not because i 'd want us relations to turn bad , i just like when the us president is n't treated as the most important person in the world but just on par with the rest . 
  macron clearly knew his moves and executed them to perfection . 
  aww , you understand me , you really really do . 
  thanks . 
  i have some ancestor kvens . 
  do n't know much about that line but just that my mother 's great-grandfather was a kven . 
  cheesy is saying it mildly . 
  it 's corny as hell . 
  [ resilient : `` men give up , but i do n't * ever * give up '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkyd-cdd_gs ), 
  yeah . 
  it did n't have the same stigma here , the few black people people saw just were described as such . 
  but ... it was still highly ignorant , borderline racist . 
  my mom 's alphabet book from the 50 's had a text `` n *** washes his face , but ca n't whiten at all '' . 
  that type of stuff was taught to kids ... 
  it was n't straight up disgusting but it was still very ignorant and built an image where the black person is a bit less than a `` normal '' white person . 
  or at least strange , abnormal . 
  but again i have to stress that there were n't that many black people in finland so it was just different to us . 
  i do n't even want to see all the horrible stuff i wrote in gymnasium . 
  too much to bare . 
  it 's been 10 years now since that , and regrettably my writing level is probably worse now . 
  my university stuff was hilariously awful as well . 
  hey , finnish is very simple . 
  i had it down at age 2 . :p yeah , when you grow into it you do n't really question * why * , but once you get to school and they start to teach you about grammar and [ all the 15 different cases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_noun_cases ) ... you start to wonder if you really even understand your own language . 
  i hated the classes where we had to learn the names for all these . 
  i just use the language . 
  i felt like the english lessons about grammar were much much simpler . 
  finnish is like a practical joke towards foreigners . 
  `` lets see how much different and more complex we can really make everything '', 
  yep . 
  but , if we want to draw up a non-compound word this is a fairly notorious one : * ep\u00e4j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llistytt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6myydell\u00e4ns\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00f6h\u00e4n * , literally meaning * `` i wonder if -- even with his/her quality of not having been made unsystematized '' * finnish language has prefixes and suffixes , and to the base word * j\u00e4rki * ( = * reason * , which is also the base word for `` systematic '' and `` order '' . 
  in that long word * '' ... j\u00e4rj ... '' * part is a declined version of this ) you can construct a mammoth of a word . 
  though , that particular one is a tough one to understand without having to stop and deconstruct every prefix and suffix . 
  but understandably the term * kalsarik\u00e4nnit * gets the rep. lol . 
  we have a saying `` finland was ran into the world map '' and the success of those runners practically did just that . 
  and there were more . 
  toivola , iso-hollo , lehtinen to name a few . 
  going down [ this list of olympic medalists in various long distance events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_olympic_medalists_in_athletics_ ( men \\ ) ) , the 20 's and 30 's are packed with finns , many times having two on the podium or even three . 
   the most famous athlete of finland is paavo nurmi . 
  awesome !, 
  good find , not many know him . 
  understandable , it 's been nearly a 100 years . 
   as far as i 've heard of , finns call him the `` eternal paavo '' . 
  huh , i have n't heard of this . 
  but he is among the athletes baring the nickname `` flying finn '' . 
  originally that group consisted of long distance runners , ethiopia has nothing compared to the dominance finns had in the early 20th century olympics . 
  kolehmainen , nurmi , ritola are the three faces on `` finnish runners ' mt. 
  rushmore ''  he won 9 olympic gold and 3 olympic silver medals . 
  he was banned to participate in the olympics after the games of amsterdam 1928 . 
  he was the last torchbearer at the helsinki 1952 summer olympics and lit the olympic cauldron . 
  and in austria , people still say `` i 'm not as fast as nurmi '' when they need more time . 
  whoa , that 's ... strange . 
  and very cool . 
  nurmi was a unique personality . 
  true to the persistent finnish stereotype , he was very quiet and distant , hardly spoke to nor really befriended anyone . 
  he just came to the track and ran . 
  his own son later told that he never really knew his father . 
  man was a myth . 
   the aland islands are part of finland but most of the alanders consider themselves swede and therefore , the alands are an autonmous province . 
  i do n't think this is true . 
  they think of themselves as \u00c5landers first and foremost . 
  i think generally they are fine with their position as an autonomous island . 
  i do n't think they really wish to be part of sweden . 
   the right wing populist party `` true finns '' is rising and rising . 
  finland was one of the first european countries where populistic right wing parties gained bigger traction and now i believe we are among the first where they are seeing numbers drop . 
  you 're right , i do n't know what i was thinking . 
  `` oh , so we ca n't get thru the ordinary route , better try the estonian border now . '', 
  x-rays are n't fool proof . 
  you can work around that easily with lead insulation , like the vests you have to use when you are being x-rayed in hospital . 
  also , you ca n't make up a system to stop any cracks , be in human error or anything you ca n't stop them 100 % from happening . 
  welp , that 's my day ruined .
