nah , there 's also cinnamon that 's basically only used for rice porridge , nothing else . 
  and some stock cubes for meat and chicken . 
  but not much else . 
  salt , onion , ~ ~ white-onion ~ ~ garlic , pepper and ketchup are practically the only spices i use/need in the kitchen . 
  plus some weird pizzamix - spice that has oregano in it . 
  if wikipedia articles list chocolate pizza as a pizza variant , i 'm free to call my flat white bread topped with special tomato sauce ^ ( ( read as : ketchup ) ^ ) and cheese a pizza , no matter what other ingredients it may have . 
  but why would i get it ** only ** for pizza if i can just use my ketchup , and make a decent pizza from that ? 
  making pizza is n't even planned usually - it is just what happens when i do n't have potato or pasta to go with my mince meat/tuna . 
  also to those who call it heresy ... 
  i 'll just call it * pitsa * then , since it 's on a whole new level of awesomeness from the thrash you call * pizza * . 
  weird ... are shrimps also a foreign topping in the north-america ? 
  could you send a site of the pizzeria that lacks tuna as topping ; i need to send some constructive criticism . 
  i know some people whose usage of ketchup is disgusting , putting ketchup in stuff like porridge and soup . ^ ( ** edit : and cereal ; wtf ** ) i do n't see how using ketchup instead of tomato sauce is so bad . 
  now eating the 2nd pizza , with tuna replaced by ground meat ( half beef , half pork ) , bacon cut into small pieces , metworst and ham . 
   ( edit : got curious and found the video . 
  ah , memories ... ) that looks delicious , minus the olives . 
   or does finland just not give a shit ? 
  others just give too many of those . 
  til people in other countries give too many fucks about pizza . 
  ^ ( * continues eating a delicious homemade `` not-pizza '' of which 's ingredients include heinz ketchup , grated cheese , canned tuna and pineapple * ), 
  too long , did n't read we are not interesting in hearing stories from other people unless we 're drunk , then we can share & listen to other people 's shitty stories until we get separated . 
  bonus : meeting interesting people leads to having friends - keeping up relations to them is too much of a hassle . 
  i was expecting small dots littered around countries and was utterly disappointed upon opening the map . 
  `` halp , forest elking '', 
  oh -- ^ ( i blame moon for assisting the joke out of my orbit . ), 
  why should they ? 
  it 's specialized knowledge used in only certain professions , while high school 's goal in the finnish system to prepare people for university . 
  oh nordics ... never change . 
  you could say everybody who lives in a country that speaks germanic language lives in an outdoor wc . 
  i think it 's probably around the same level of ease after reading the other comments . 
  it 's fennoscandia ... 
  i use it , and so should everyone else, 
   pretty sure it 's all of scandinavia  scandinavia i feel like someone jabbed me in the guts , please just say nordics or something else ... 
  i am curious on how well can native english speakers read this, 
   `` why is this guy talking to me , i do n't know him '' more like `` is this guy drunk ? '', 
   remember people , one ~ ~ arm ~ ~ ** man ** length !, 
  ftfy, 
  people who do n't have a free seat do n't sit , they stand while looking at their mobile phones , avoiding any and all eye contact with others on the bus, 
  what ? 
  are you trying to imply they ever take it out ? 
  well , at least it 's not the iso-britannia, 
  according to wikipedia denmark counts as well , i just thought of the scandinavian mountain range , my bad . 
  scandinavia is norway , ** denmark ** and sweden , but if you want to be accurate , you can use `` fennoscandian - '' , `` nordic - '' or `` best countries ' - '' instead . 
  edit : according to wikipedia denmark counts as well , i just thought of the scandinavian mountain range , my bad . 
  the golden rule is that if you have nothing worth saying , you stay silent . 
  it 's ok to forget this rule when drunk , since most others do it anyways . 
  ok , give us enough oil and we 'll light it up, 
  around 100 meters according to [ this ] ( https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm ) website . 
  i did n't wish for a proper summer anyways . 
  [ this morning ] ( http://m.imgur.com/glkymsj ) first time i 've ever experienced snow 2 weeks before midsummer in my 18 years of life . 
  \u00c4s juu kan see , finlant is veeri dankerous . 
  no , they just happen to retail our beer and vodka at a cheaper price than in finland . 
  it 's easy since the pronunciation always follows simple rules . 
  since bawbawbaw1 's sentence does n't have any 2 letters in a row , it should be rather easy to pronounce . 
  easy to write and pronounce . 
  always logical , never do we pronounce `` o `` s as `` i `` s , or `` x `` s as `` z `` s, 
  with regret . 
  as long as manual cars exist , you really should n't learn it , you may brake at high speeds and cause severe accidents if you ever have to drive a manual car . 
  and is far less expensive . 
   you guys have a grenade problem kek, 
  ... would n't that make us 15-0 in the rounds won ? 
  we had smart politicians that decided it 's smarter not to fuck with a nuclear-armed superpower that can level our country in matter of hours . 
  those same people made sure we held onto our sovereignty and democracy . 
   free of ` soviet taint ' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_people%27s_republic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satellite_state uhh ... 
  i 'm sorry ... polen can not into roman either . 
  grand duchy of finland was a part of russian empire that never became a part of ussr ( therefore free of ` soviet taint ' ), 
  because france is n't russia , 
  why would russia not attack a country ... 
  \u00dcbermensch are to equivalent of the neanderthals to the glorious homo germanicus . 
  i guess he was confused at the fact that swedish is still an official second language in finland . 
  i swear i could make a blind taste test and ask people which pizza used ketchup and not even italians could tell the difference . 
  and can confirm the part about disliking helsinki , but have n't met anyone that 's anti-norway . 
  i even know some finns that live in the far-northern finland but work in norway due to better pay . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's mostly hate on russians . 
  hate on sweden is some ice hockey banter gone overboard and some hate on the language that 's compulsory in schools . 
  i have n't really heard of any hate on norway either . 
  superb language . 
  you do realize the joke stopped being funny by the 2nd comment , right ? 
  at that point all it did was make me worried about the average quality of education in europe . 
  personal space !, 
  2 people per a kilometer squared !, 
  but how do you represent 2 separate usa : ns ? 
  no , it 's just that saara 's picture has grey background and the maker of this image placed her like this because southern finland allows the face to fit better . 
  besides , if sami people was given their own region it 'd be further north and need a chunk of norway and sweden too . 
  i was just memeing . 
  this '' / s '' just does n't work in finland . 
  but [ which ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bread_roll ) [ semla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) ? 
  `` get '' belongs inside the quotation marks . 
  oh , it was a reference . 
  i do n't listen to that much music so i was very confused . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  did you reply to the wrong comment or something ? 
  `` pinus sylvestris '' , says wikipedia . 
  keep in mind that i do n't know shit about trees or biology . 
  ah , the karma double-dip . 
  nobody said it 's the same . 
  ketchup is objectively superior because it comes in a bottle and does n't spoil nearly as fast . 
  heathen , most of pasta-foods without ketchup are like hangover without the drunk . 
  i 've seen some places here put both kebabsauce and the white sauce you 're talking about on kebab . 
  sometimes the tzaziki-like-sauce is put on the salad ( often served alongside the kebab ),
