i think [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p9nrytg.png ) polandball describes nordic drinking habits pretty accurately . 
  [ finnish comedy tends to be a bit grim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfg9xopkk ), 
   they saw a gunman entering the train car with an automatic rifle , he said . 
  ` as he was cocking it to shoot it , alek just yells , ` spencer , go ! ', 
  and spencer runs down the aisle , ' sadler said . 
  ` spencer makes first contact , he tackles the guy , alek wrestles gun away from him , and the gunman pulls out a box cutter and slices spencer a few times . 
  and the three of us beat him until he was unconscious . ', 
  thank god these men were on board and acted quickly !, 
  i had no idea people do this in helsinki !, 
  oh , i did n't know it was widespread . 
  in finland everyone just stands wherever they wish and you ca n't get past them if you 're in a hurry ( in finland it is impossible to ask for them to move , you are supposed to just frown silently ) . 
  when i was visiting london i liked the orderly fashion when using escalators . 
  absolutely everyone stands in the right side of the escalator , leaving the left side free for those who are in a hurry . 
  before april 2014 you could n't find any hard liquors on the alko website , it was banned until that . 
  so he 's talking about the previous state of things . 
  if i recall correctly , the alko website did n't show any hard liquors a few years ago but the ban was lifted some time ago . 
  edit : i did some googling and found a finnish source . 
  i recalled correctly and the ban was lifted on april 2014 . http://yle.fi/uutiset/alko_tyytyvainen__vakevien_hinnat_tulevat_nettiin/7114483, 
  i really like those all , i 'd also like to add the finnish army honorary march [ porilaisten marssi , 18th century ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iagm6-riuus ) ( [ wiki link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bj%c3%b6rneborgarnas_marsch ) ), 
  this is really sad news but not that surprising . 
  we 've gotten used to nokia and later microsoft firing people after people . 
  he was talking about the military service , not civilian service . 
  you do n't get sent to the reserve after civilian service . 
  here 's the article ( in finnish ) http://yle.fi/uutiset/vaaliehdokas_yritti_aanestaa_itseaan__aani_katosi_jaljettomiin/7953002 edit : he made a complaint and the police is investigating the matter . 
  uhh , well i do n't think my misery is ** endless ** , so to speak . 
  an adequate amount of misery . 
  same in finland , i 'd find it a bit strange if someone over 20 still lived with their parents . 
  i moved out when i was 19 to go study in a university . 
  there used to be , but now they 're all gone . 
  replaced by cellphones . 
  yes , i agree with you . 
  i 'm not concerned with a ukraine-like situation in finland in the foreseeable future . 
  but if europe lets this situation slide with russia it would imply a weak europe and that would be bad for future development of russian-european relations with security in mind . 
  in a weak europe it is easier for russia to influense finland and the baltics . 
  huh ? 
  i definitely think the sanctions must be kept in place and i think this is also the popular opinion . 
  i 'm not saying the sanctions do n't hurt us , they most definitely do . 
  but they must be kept in place to combat further russian aggression . 
  a weak europe would be more dangerous to us than our current recession . 
  oh , i never realized how much i need some surplus polish nuclear waders !, 
  there are atoms everywhere !, 
  a finnish military surplus store [ varusteleka ] ( https://www.varusteleka.com/en ) ships worldwide . 
  i tried out of curiosity and shipping costs to germany seem to be only 7,45 $ , probably about the same for all eu . 
  they sell pretty good stuff with affordable prices . 
  i have bought some cheap army clothes from there to use while fishing etc. 
  i study computer science too and what you said sounds very similar to our system . 
  a lot more work than high school but it is n't a life and death situation anymore so pretty much no stress . 
  if you fail high school end exams it means no more studies for you , thus the extreme stress . 
  in university if for some reason you fail a class you can try again next year and failing an exam does n't mean losing your chances for continuing your studies , you just do the exam again . 
  the exams may be hard but at least they wo n't do any permanent damage to your career !, 
  yeah , each exam takes up to six hours . 
  [ the student hat from the title ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mug8wse.jpg ) . 
  the students get to wear these in the graduation seremony . 
  i do n't know if other countries apart from nordics have any similar tradition in europe . 
  i guess it 's kind of same as the square hat that high school graduates wear in the usa . 
  this picture makes me uncomfortable , thank god my high school exams are long gone . 
  probably the most stressful time of my life , university has been nothing compared to preparing to these exams . 
  thanks for the map , aryan finland sends its [ regards .

  although kekkonen was democratically elected every time . 
  russian politics are a bit more shady . 
  finnish = spanish ? 
  uh , now when i think about it , it might be a bit weird ... finnish language so progressive !, 
  the word for hobby-horse also means an excuse in finnish . 
  so the pro-immigration people are saying that anti-immigration folk are only using sexual crimes committed by refugees as their excuse to protest against refugees . 
  so the pro-immigration protesters are taunting the anti-immigration protesters with the hobby-horses . 
  i do n't know if any law specifically protects protests . 
  usually police monitors protests and orders any people interfering to stay back . 
  if they refuse the order then they commit a crime and can get to jail to protect the protest . 
  thanks for the idea , i posted the picture there . 
  hopefully funny results ensue . 
  [ last week people dressed as clowns were harassing an anti-immigrant march . 
  ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article8619858.ece/alternates/w960/lks%2020160123%20tampere.jpg ) these people apparently do n't want to be taken seriously . 
  a piece of news about this in english : http://yle.fi/uutiset/two_loldiers_of_odin_clowns_arrested_in_tampere_during_anti-immigrant_parade/8620086, 
  no police state in any way . 
  this policeman is protecting a legitimate demonstration from being disrupted by this protester . 
  it 's a part of free speech . 
  today there was a demonstration in helsinki protesting against further immigration . 
  a counterdemonstration was also arranged where hobby-horse wielding people tried to disrupt the demonstration . 
  police stepped in to ensure peace between the two demonstrations . 
  source for picture ( news in finnish ) : http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1454123672070.html this was such an absurd picture i had to share it .

  [ kouvola ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fjeslan.jpg ) is somewhat disliked for its soviet looks . 
   rejected names : matti was rejected for a boy because it did n't indicate gender . 
  matti is a perfectly normal male name in finland , maybe he had finnish parents . 
   they also consult foreign embassies for assistance with non-german names . 
  i wonder why it was still rejected if they supposedly check them with embassies . 
  that is exactly what i said .

  most of these are no longer in use , but the coastline of finland is littered with cannons pointed at the sea .
