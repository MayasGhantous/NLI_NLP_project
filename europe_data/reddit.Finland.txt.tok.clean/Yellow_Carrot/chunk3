  reservists are people who have military training . 
  a bit different from `` every abled man '' . 
  sweden has n't trained new reservists since 2010 apart from a small professional force . 
  i would n't call estonia 's armed forces sad , they spend a fair share of their gdp in military expences , more than sweden . 
  another example of a cold war disaster averted was [ the note crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/note_crisis ) . 
  to put it shortly , soviet union demanded that finland and soviet union together have a consultation on how to defend against west german aggression . 
  this would 've destroyed finnish neutrality and in the end soviet union withdrew their demand . 
  this success ensured finnish president kekkonen 's re-election . 
  kekkonen ( white shirt , middle ) looked pretty chill in hawaii when he received word of the crisis : http://i.imgur.com/xuqo2fn.jpg, 
  you 're thinking about special forces or movies . 
  in reality regular troops are still regular troops even if they get paid . 
  besides , fighting a war is not such a complicated thing for a regular soldier that it ca n't be taught in 6-12 months ( service time in finland ) . 
  the last time i was in a mandatory refreshment training i was actually impressed how well everyone still knew their jobs years after leaving service . 
  to me it seems like he is questioning if the woman made up the claim she was raped and that the cubans are now jailed under false accusations . 
  ridiculous to always presume that even after the trial . 
  all rape is not made up by women . 
  other commenter said that there was even video evidence : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53moo0/cuba_volleyball_players_jailed_for_rape_in_finland/d7ug9oo, 
  of course you can talk to someone if it serves a purpose . 
  for example asking someone if a certain bus has already gone . 
  but after that you are not expected to carry on a conversation , they asked a question and got an answer . 
  i think in some countries that would lead to small talk but usually not here . 
  we do n't make friends with random people on the street . 
  friends are made at school , college , work , hobbies or with friends of friends . 
  i 've never experienced any trouble with this in finland , the buses usually maintain their schedule just fine . 
  if anything they 're late , never too early . 
  cheek kissing was a stressful experience for me when i was in france !, 
  yeah i 've heard other stories too where a stunned tourist is left to just stare at the back lights of the bus as it drives past them !, 
  all because they did n't know to raise their hand . 
  i thought about the reason behind this as well and i also suspect that the population amount is part of it . 
  i find it confusing that in some countries ( or all other countries ? ), 
  the driver either guesses whether you want to ride the bus or they stop at every stop . 
  seems like such a waste of time to me !, 
  you signal the bus driver = bus stops , you do n't signal = bus keeps on going . 
  it 's probably the shadow playing with your eyes . 
  oh man , this picture reminds me of this one indian guy who was standing in a queue behind me . 
  all the time i tried to go farther away from him and he would just keep pushing against me . 
  an utter clash of cultures ... 
  oh right , i guess you just have to adapt . 
  i mean , even in finland we do n't always have the luxury of 2 meters of personal space !, 
  it 's funny when you think about it . 
  even i have many times noticed a foreigner coming too close to me , the absolute worst i can do is give them a disgruntled look and go on with my day . 
  ah , i have the perfect [ comic ] ( https://i.imgur.com/l6g4eak.png ) to describe bus travelling in finland !, 
  you ca n't tell me what to do !, 
  * upvoted *, 
  well , this picture is of course a funny extreme . 
  but yes , it is polite to keep your distance to others . 
  just google finnish bus stop and see the results : http://i.imgur.com/fpv0whf.jpg http://imgur.com/2jhn1hn https://imgur.com/uaouv all these look perfectly normal to me . 
  yeah talking to a stranger at a stop is almost a capital offense . 
  if someone tries to strike a conversation with you , you can be sure they are either drunk , insane or a foreigner . 
  please mind my [ personal space ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dfmduoxcn8 ) .

  i do n't think they 're pulling him , the safety rope is there to just make sure he does n't sink under the ice and die . 
  finland ca n't possibly afford a professional military with the same strength that hundreds of thousands of reservists provide . 
  a lesser force would jeopardize our independence . 
  but yeah i can see both sides of the argument . 
  this is just the way majority wants it here . 
  here 75 % of age group 15-24 supports conscription [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.defmin.fi/files/2973/mts_raportti_suomeksi_nettiversio.pdf ) ] so i doubt a chance to vote on the subject would change anything . 
  being a democracy does n't mean a country ca n't have conscription . 
  the people vote to have conscription in place , that 's democratic right ? 
  in finland conscription has a strong support of the voters . 
  you can take a look at a map to figure out why . 
  yeah that 's pretty cool !, 
  even i have distant relatives there , some of my family moved there in the beginning of 1900s . 
  but i only a while ago learned from reddit that it 's actually a very significant number of people there with finnish ancestry . 
  for interested people , map of the us with [ percentage of population who are finnish descendants ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/pct_finnish4.png ) after learning this i 've been intrigued to travel there , maybe even visit long lost relatives . 
  well that 's something i did n't expect to hear : nordic building style in mexico brought there by americans who originally came from here . 
  great how culture spreads !, 
  not according to the news piece written about it . 
  finnish : http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1421556867993  hengitt\u00e4v\u00e4 hirsirakenne voisi ratkaista yleiset kosteusongelmat translated : breathing timber structures could solve common moisture problems . 
  no , the timber breaths and thus does n't get moist . 
  no moisture no mold . 
  but heating will be more expensive though . 
  the red barns come from traditional [ falu red paint ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falu_red ) . 
  used for ages in nordics and good for preserving wood ( and looks nice too ) . 
  cool to know that nordic immigrants brought it to the us !, 
  i do n't know where you got that . 
  it just does n't get mold so easily and looks pretty . 
  do n't be so hostile . 
  i 'll tell what i know . 
  [ prefabricated buildings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prefabricated_building ) are cheap and fast to make but modern thermal insulation in walls easily collects moisture , especially if mistakes were made while building . 
  this leads to mold in time . 
  timber buildings are more expensive to make i imagine and they require lots of heating in our winter because insulation is n't as good . 
  but the building breaths so it does n't collect moisture and thus it does n't get mold . 
  you seem to think wood is somehow unsuitable for buildings . 
  however old wooden buildings have usually no problems with mold or moisture . 
  triggered, 
  yeah the article was quite poor actually , it does n't describe the drink much at all to those who do n't already know it . 
  [ wiki has a decent article about it . 
  got ta take care of my personal space !, 
  lousy tourists [ are always too close to me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/azzmgph.png ) ... ^ ^ mumble ^ ^ ^ mumble ... ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  sorry , i know nothing about beer brewing , i just read it from the sahti wiki article :  unlike most beers , traditional sahti wort goes straight from the lauter tun to the fermenter without boiling . 
  this gives it a relatively short shelf-life i tried to do more research and some people wrote that sahti becomes too sour to drink after a while because it still has live lactobacillus bacteria in it . 
  so possibly it does n't go ` bad ' as in poisonous , it goes ` bad ' as in it tastes too terrible to drink after a few weeks . 
  but i have no more knowledge on the matter than what google tells me . 
  i 've heard many times before that old sahti will give you stomach ache but now i 'm unsure . 
  a good lager but not sahti !, 
  in the news article i edited on my previous message a finnish brewery owner says that he was serving sahti at a berlin beer festival last january . 
  so it might not even require a trip to finland to get a taste , 
  both of those are just regular lagers , no luck !, 
  i 'd guess it 's pretty much impossible to find ouside of finland , it only stays good for some weeks which is too little for any meaningful importing .
