  this is because of sahti is not boiled like regular beers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahti edit : there recently was a news article about how people are interested about sahti but imports are a huge challenge . 
  they sent a 1500 litre test branch to the us and it was sold out in advance . 
  interested people can try google translate : http://yle.fi/uutiset/michael_jackson_siivittaa_sahtia_yhdysvaltoihin_asti__linkki_mesopotamian_ja_nykyoluen_valilla/9076220, 
  life would be pretty difficult if i only spoke finnish . 
  english is quite necessary for many jobs ( i work in it , would be unemployed if i did n't know english ) . 
  let alone using the internet would be quite difficult ... edit :  knowing english means less than knowing how to write a small application how are you even supposed to learn programming without english skills ? 
  all those programming languages you mentioned are based on english . 
  depending on the area the snow is put on trucks and driven elsewhere . 
  but when suitable , the snow is just gathered in some place where it does n't bother anyone , like this parking lot corner . 
  this place does n't seem particularly busy . 
  i do n't see why it would be necessary to take the snow elsewhere when it can just stay there in the pile until it melts by itself . 
  the amount of work needed to just keep snow out of sight for no reason would be insane . 
  huh ? 
  if you mean the pile of snow , that place looks like a corner of some parking lot and the snow has been gathered there on purpose . 
  snowplows need to plow the snow somewhere . 
  it 's because of swedish speaking finns , not to please sweden . 
  it 's our second official language . 
  then you have understood it wrong . 
  it definitely means drinking home alone . 
  yeah i pretty much agree . 
  although as relations with russia are tensioning , some finnish politicians have been suggesting appeasing to russia etc finlandization politics . 
  luckily most of these politicians are old soviet era people who did n't notice that soviet union ceased to exist a while ago . 
  pretty irrelevant i mean . 
  indeed , i 'm glad finland is nowadays integrated to the west via the eu . 
  helps us avoid ending up in a similar situation again . 
  just to add to this , [ kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) was both popular with the people and the leaders of soviet union . 
  he managed to keep good relations with the soviets during the cold war and still keep finland neutral ( [ yeah you do n't need to lecture me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) ) . 
  ah , makes sense to link our english language option to the sidebar instead of the default !, 
  at least if you fellow europeans are supposed to understand anything . 
  huh , why is that ? 
  strange that some countries have a default sub and others do n't . 
  finland also has two subs , one in english and the other in finnish . 
  the finnish language sub is our default . 
  edit : i just noticed that even our tiny / r/suomi has more subs than your / r/de , strange that only your iama has been defaulted . 
  i think you used the wrong sub for finland , / r/suomi ( 1.1 % ) is the more active finnish sub and also the geolocation default sub for finns . 
  you appear to have calculated with the much smaller english speaking sub / r/finland ( 0.22 % ) . 
  just some feedback , nice and interesting map nevertheless !, 
  of course , we call that [ pl\u00f6r\u00f6 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pl%c3%b6r%c3%b6 ) !, 
  recipe : put a coin in an empty coffee cup . 
  pour coffee on the coin until it is not visible anymore . 
  then add vodka until you can see the coin again . 
  then enjoy !, 
  instead of standing right next to each other at the stop , people are extremely spread out because of the finnish perseption of personal space . 
  normal country : [ pic ] ( http://rzhooker.com/uploads/projectbusstop/project%20bus%20stop%20upload%201%20-%20july%201/rzh-bus-stop-15.jpg ) finland : [ pic2 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5pstmyk.jpg ), 
  yes , even in this [ photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/duktpgu.jpg ) you can clearly see how the adjutant is worried how this sauli dude manhandles the president !, 
  sauli being the only way he knows , [ cool as fuck . 
   does anyone know what kind of fish that is right in front behind the potatos and how they were prepared ? 
  the vendaces are rolled in a mixture made of salt , pepper and rye flour . 
  once the fish have been covered with this they 're just fried in butter . 
  delicious !, 
  the filling is made with ground beef and rice . 
  and onion in this case ( text in finnish but see the pictures ) : http://purkitkurkussa.blogspot.fi/2012/05/lihislihapiirakkalortsykeitinpiiras.html, 
  the original l\u00f6rtsy is filled with meat , the sweet jam version is a more `` recent '' thing ( recent being from the 80s ) . 
  my friend is from savonlinna ( l\u00f6rtsy is the local delicacy there ) and he 's very passionate about his l\u00f6rtsys so i better know this !, 
  from my point of view the danish are evil !, 
  finland and estonia are together buying k9 howitzers from south korea . 
  finland will buy 48 and estonia 12 pieces according to news sources ( finnish source : http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9446485 ) .

  the finnish name for santa ( joulupukki = christmas goat ) originates from old finnish pagan festivities where some men would dress themselves as goats ( symbol of fertility ) and visit houses drinking alcohol offered to them . 
  at some point the pagan kekripukki turned into christian joulupukki . 
  huh , so that 's what freedom looks like .

  translated lyrics ( excluding the nonsense scat singing ) from another [ thread  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5ua98z/had_this_song_in_my_head_for_a_long_time_finally/ddt3lw0/ )  the sound of a polka drifted from my neighbor 's and set my feet a-tapping oh !, 
  ieva 's mother had her eye on her daughter but ieva she managed to fool her , you know . 
  'cause who 's going to listen to mother saying no when we 're all busy dancing to and fro !, 
   ieva was smiling , the fiddle it was wailing as people crowded round to wish her luck . 
  everyone was hot but it did n't seem to bother the handsome young man , the dashing buck . 
  'cause who 's going to mind a drop of sweat when he 's all busy dancing to and fro !, 
   ieva 's mother she shut herself away in her own quiet room to hum a hymn . 
  leaving our hero to have a spot of fun in a neighbor 's house when the lights are dim . 
  'cause what does it matter what the old folks say when you 're all busy dancing to and fro !, 
   when the music stopped then the real fun began and that 's when the laddie fooled around . 
  when he took her home , when the dancing was over her mother angrily waiting they found . 
  but i said to her , ieva , now do n't you weep and we 'll soon be dancing to and fro !, 
   i said to her mother now stop that noise or i wo n't be responsible for what i do . 
  if you go quietly and stay in your room you wo n't get hurt while your daughter i woo . 
  'cause this fine laddie is a wild sort of guy when he 's all busy dancing to and fro !, 
   one thing i tell you is you wo n't trap me , no , you wo n't find me an easy catch . 
  travel to the east and travel to the west but ieva and i are going to make a match . 
  'cause this fine laddie ai n't the bashful sort when he 's all busy dancing to and fro, 
  well as a finn i 'm a vodka elemental so koskenkorva is as essential to me as water is to you !, 
  anyone have some idea why finland is doing better than the other nordics ? 
  the difference is surprisingly big to me . 
  i thought [ drinking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ofymvai.jpg ) was the popular pastime but i guess drugs would work as well . 
  you 've been downvoted but this is true ( well , not exactly as cows ) , bear was a sacred animal in finnish paganism : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_paganism#sacred_animals, 
  four brits had the bright idea to cross the finnish-russian border to get to drink beer in the russian side . 
  they were lucky to be caught by finns instead of russian border guard . 
  now they will get some fines and are already back at uk . 
  i do n't know what you counted as a motorway but in my opinion finland is missing almost all of them . 
  english wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highways_in_finland finnish wiki has a map of the roads : https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/valtatiet_suomessa for the lazy : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/suomi_valtatiet.png, 
  finns going to sweden is no surprise , a traditional emigration destination that offers good employment opportunities in a similar culture . 
  i have lots of family who moved there during the cold war and even one of my friends moved there for work a couple of years back .
