is there a translation ? 
  why the fuck do people post articles in french , german or whatever to an enlish sub . 
  like wtf . 
  it was more of a joke . 
  obviously you should n't apologize for the misgivings of the lax immigration policies , since most people other than the very elite have little to do with it , other than voting of course . 
  i 'd be very interested to see where the funds of the trafficker 's are coming from , aside from the refugees themselves . 
  isis ? 
  saudis ? 
  this does impose a lot of pressure on countries set against isis . 
  the train company decision to haul them here without asking for papers is the best . 
  even immigrants themselves have admitted there 's a shit ton of suspicious characters among the ` refugees ' and a lot claim to be from syria to get in . 
  shit is getting out of hand . 
  i do n't think i saw finland there so here i go . 
  ** the coalition government : ** * ** centre party ** ( * suomen keskusta * ) - currently in power , formed the coalition government with the national coalition and finns party . 
  centrist and liberal economics wise with strong focus and presence in municipalities and rural areas ( formerly called the agrarian league ) . 
  often attributed to cronyism , and famous for the slang phrase `` centre betrays '' ( * `` kepu pett\u00e4\u00e4 '' * ) . 
  current prime minister is centre 's juha sipil\u00e4 , a christian centrist with an entrepreneurial background . 
  laestadians are a huge part of the voter base . 
  * ** national coalition party ** ( * kansallinen kokoomus * ) - right wing , conservative , ran the former coalition government , very much personified by the former prime minister jyrki katainen and his dealings with the euro crisis , and currently by the pepsodent smile minister of finance alexander stubb . 
  more focused on the national and international scale , a major part in the recent policies driving for social and health care reformation as well as municipal mergers . 
  * ** finns party ** ( * perussuomalaiset * ) - nationalist , leftist and eu-skeptic party with a strong focus on immigration . 
  recently gained a lot of infamy when a finns party mp wrote a ambivalent facebook update opposing multiculturalism . 
  that lead to a demonstration by 15 000 people . 
  often called racists by the far-left parties and activists , though most right wing conservatives/nationalists tend to drift apart form them due to leftist economic policies . 
  ** the opposition ** : * ** social democratic party of finland ** ( * sosiaalidemokraattinen puolue , sdp * ) - social democrats , old socialists that drifted apart from the more radical left after the civil war in 1918 . 
  strong connections to the trade unions and identifies as a sort of labour party , although major part of voters think they shoot themselves in the foot with their regulation of the job markets . 
  ( full disclosure : imo they have crippled the job market by legislation that burdens small businesses in that they ca n't afford to hire anybody which in turn cripples the job market in a national scale . 
  the new coalition strives for localized contracts instead of the collective labor agreement ) * ** green league ** ( * vihre\u00e4 liitto * ) - green party that 's very leftist in their economic policies , eager to tax the finnish industry by way of emission taxes and so on . 
  also home for a few liberalists , but imo the intellectual wing left for the pirate party or others . 
  originally formed from a collection of environmental activists . 
  more recently made famous by the first ever gay presidential candidate pekka haavisto . 
  also a strong proponent for multiculturalism and cultural diversity . 
  * ** left alliance ** ( * vasemmistoliitto * ) - socialist party and recently very strong proponent of green policies due to an influx of young members , which drove most of the old school working class socialists/communists to finns party or communist micro-parties . 
  youth group has strong connections to anti-fascist organizations and anarchists . 
  * ** swedish people 's party of finland ** ( * suomen ruotsalainen kansanpuolue * ) - a representative of the finnish swedes , a minority that 's a remnant of the time finland was a province under swedish rule that ended in 1809 . 
  their policies and leanings change depending on who is forming the government , but they do have a strong focus on preserving the historical , cultural and lingual heritage of swedes in finland ( also called svenska talande b\u00e4ttre folk ) . 
  * ** christian democrats of finland ** ( * suomen kristillisdemokraatit * ) - christian conservatives whose leader p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen is famous for driving prohibitionary policies . 
  they are quite lefists in economics , calling for personal and collective responsibility and emphasizing value of human lives in a very christian manner . 
  after the relevant one 's there are liberal parties , nationalist parties , communist parties , the pirate party and so on . 
  tl ; dr : centre - centrists and cronies national coalition - conservatives finns party - nationalists sdp - the name says it , union pawns green league - hippies left alliance - hippies and neo-commies swedish people 's party - swedes christian democrats - they do n't like anything fun, 
  i 'll be honest , this rustled my jimmies . 
  i 'd wager that mistake would piss off any s\u00e1mi more so than a finn . 
  sure they do , though valburgis day is relatively new as a tradition . 
  weirdly , this is a distant reminder of finnish easter tradition of kids dressing up as witches and going from door to door to sing a traditional song and hand out wicker canes cut from the little branches of pussy willows - for candy etc. 
  i would n't be surprised if some sort of whipping was involved in the olden days . 
  i think the root of it is a pagan tradition , and a lot of those have come from the balkans , so it should n't be a long shot to think slavic traditions have had a hand in this . 
  interesting easter tradition though , you do you czechs . 
  or just plain sound warnings . 
  that wind was n't a gentle breeze as i 'm sure you 've noticed . 
  thanks for the sound warning ya douche . 
  in my country the process to revert or change a law is an arduous one so for the 4 year term each mp really needs to consider what 's worth their time and energy . 
  of course there 's a lot of political back and forth but then that 's a discussion on democracy as a whole , and if you do not like the change it brings every few years , then you have to ask if you really want a parliamentary system at all . 
  `` tighter control '' well , there you have it . 
  i 'm not sure if you meant something along the lines of more control over policy making in the long run , but this pretty sums up why more than two terms is frowned upon . 
  even when putin was not a president himself , he was the prime minister , which has reaaaaally raised some eyebrows , and ofcourse taking the podium yet again , after the one term medvedev . 
  far be it from me or any other non-russian to dictate who you should elect , but do you really think his position in the government is solely based on popularity ? 
  [ blazerz ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3y9vpg/map_of_putins_net_approval_rating_xpost/cybswqu ) answered this above . 
  also brutal dictator is quite a stretch , and this coming from a finn who does n't really enjoy living next to such an unpredictable nation . 
  he does enjoy popularity among the people and projects a strong image in foreign politics , which can net him a lot of points among other nationalities , since strength is still quite valued in diplomacy and war . 
  i do n't support his actions and he plays a lot of shady and clandestine games out of distrust towards other nations . 
  russians , in many ways , seem so alien to the `` western '' world , where as indians in my mind are as conservative still , though correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  i also understand that there 's literally a billion indians so generalizations , both yours and mine are quite a leap . 
  most usually move to the larger population centers in the south , if they do n't live there already , and most who study in the town they grew up in , move into their own flat , rental/dorm/whatever . 
  girls usually start their third level studies right after high school , guys most likely serve in the army/civil service for 6 to 12 months before moving on to study . 
  very concerning and those people wont win anyone of my compatriots over with that hodgepodge . 
  losing petsamo and karelia is still a really sore spot to some . 
  would you agree with the idea that not a lot of people in russia place any value on politicians ? 
  iirc russia 's politician 's are quite closely tied to the oligarchs/mafia , a hunch based on news and a bit of reading on the matter . 
  my experience on the matter is that most people with radical ideas , once elected get pulled into the system and ground to bits . 
  the compromises and difficult choices erode their public image and lead to them disappearing from politics after one or two terms , and a professional politician ( as in , corrupt/puppet ) takes their place . 
  though you make a rather crude generalization based upon one individual . 
  i think this subreddit is testament to growing dissent among the russians . 
  the war he won was an invasion into europe , which does not really help to sympathize with this growing sentiment , rather most view it as war-mongers praising their icon . 
  this is the general sentiment in finland at least afaik . 
  roks at it again . 
  dunno about their current state , but holst 's statement really drives home the fact how misrepresented male rape victims are , even going so far as to making male rape a women 's issue . 
  not to mention the fact politico deemed roks worthy of interview after their history , an article that talks about male rape has no comments from male rape victim 's support group . 
  i do n't know if that 's due to there is no such organisation or that they did n't think to seek a comment from one , furthermore i do n't know which is worse . 
  this . 
  mostly it was just madam chancellor 's brain fart and now everybody 's paying the price , in addition of falling into the pockets of the federalists . 
  the crisis itself was born outside eu 's sphere of influence , because of the usa-russia proxy war and middle east being generally a fucked up place . 
  that 's the direction eu has been taking for ages , so no i do n't think i would give merkel credit for stupid shit like this . 
  merkel wishes all the masses welcome , now there 's a cry for eu border guard ? 
  everybody lashes out on hungary for trying to protect borders , the ride never ends . 
  i might have been a bit dramatic , but and i fully support identifying the moderate muslim community from the wahhabist sect , but rather through a reform conducted by the moderates . 
  as is , islam teaches many out-dated beliefs that are not compatible western society . 
  you also make the incorrect assumption that i would be leftist . 
  i am not . 
  though i might have read in a bit too liberally . 
  but again , banning extremist preaches only sweeps the problem under the rug . 
  you should not be afraid of islam . 
  that 's the last thing you wan na be . 
  islamophobia is used as an straw-man to counter any criticism towards the religion . 
  i understand people are afraid , and recent events have gotten everybody on the edge , but the last thing you want to do in the face of terrorism is succumb to fear . 
  after that you suggest we ban islam ? 
  that is n't akin to western society and is another way to serve the interests of radicalists . 
  by banning something you only sweep the problem under the rug and you further isolate the radical elements from the rest of society . 
  they are not going to stop just because they 're told so , they 're going to brew their ideology of hatred out of the public eye and the results are gon na be possibly even more savage . 
  the best way to discount a nonsensical ideology is to pull it out of the shadows to be seen and judged by everyone . 
  in the long run , your fear-mongering authoritarian proposals serve only the interests of terrorism .
