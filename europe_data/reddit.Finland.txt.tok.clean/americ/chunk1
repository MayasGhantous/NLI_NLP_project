not exactly on a national border , but travel to tallinn , estonia from helsinki is a 2-3 hour trip one way . 
  the effect it has , is that finns travel to tallinn to pay 30-50 % less on alcohol than they would in finland . 
  i had a friend from the us visit , who didnt believe me when i told him about this . 
  the day we went to the ferry terminal , out of the door came a man pulling an industrial crate full of alcohol behind him . 
  my friend quickly realized i was n't pulling his leg .

  you could do a trip on 1800 , if you budgeted out , and planned out roughly what you wanted to do . 
  what 's nice about europe , is that you have quite the diversity of transport options that do n't require a car ( rentals can be quite expensive ) . 
  for example , if you live on the west coast you can actually do roundtrip tickets for a lot less than you 'd expect . 
  check out http://www.norwegian.com/us/ . 
  oakland - oslo/stockholm ( one way ) start at 250 $ . 
  once you get into the eu , your flights inside can be quite cheap ( much like flying within the us ) . 
  they also have decent deals from the east coast as well . 
  after that , check out staying in airbnb , though google hotel finder worked quite well for last minute deals . 
  a lot of people recommend hostels , which are fine , but airbnb can be quite cost competitive , and the option of having your own apartment with a kitchen will cut down on cost if you do n't mind cooking . 
  most places have public transit for a reasonable price within the city ( if you 're in a city with a population greater than 100,000 people in western europe ) . 
  lastly , check out / r/travel . 
  i have n't used it myself , but i 'm pretty sure they would be able to figure out a trip on $ 1800 for you !,

  thanks !,

  i think the sub is a good way to follow pan-european news , as there is no ` european news.google.com ' equivalent , plus the comments are usually quite insightful . 
  the sub can be an echo-chamber/cj at times , but in general / r/europe is quite nice . 
  `` it 's your own health you destroy , after all . '', 
  smoking is directly linked to increased risk of cancer . 
  treating cancer is not inexpensive . 
  in many european countries , the burden of paying for healthcare is shared by all members of society . 
  thus , an individual smoking will harm others by burdening others with the deferred health/economic costs til later in life . 
  take bladder cancer for [ example ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bladder_cancer ) . 
  it has the [ highest treatment per patient cost ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2694315/ ) of any cancer . 
  tobacco smoking is the [ most common risk factor in patients with bladder cancer ] ( http://jama.jamanetwork.com/mobile/article.aspx?articleid=1104233 ) . 
  it 's not just your own health you destroy , but you are literally taking taxpayer euros out of the pockets of your family , friends , and neighbors , when you choose to smoke .

  any russian language speakers wan na confirm ? 
  dual american-finn living in helsinki now for 4 years . 
  oregon , usa for 22 years before that . 
  1 ) having been here for 4 years , i have only encountered 2 people that i can remember who got confrontational when my nationality came up : 1 ) was a drunken lady in kallio who started criticizing us foreign policy ( i agreed with a fair number of points ) , and 2 ) a belgian dude got a little carried away with insults while watching the us-belgian soccer match last summer . 
  those strongly contrast from the 99.99 % of other people who i 've met here , who are generally interested when they hear i 'm an american , which is typically followed up with a ` why [ the fuck ] are you here ? 
  no one comes here , let alone from the us . ', 
  2 ) i 've been all over the states . 
  have n't made it to hawaii/alaska yet though . 
  3 ) have n't met any finno-americans who are not dual citizens . 
  i consider dual-citizens ( myself included ) to be different . 
  the treaties/laws governing dual-citizenship between us and finland require a first degree relative in order to get finnish citizenship if you were born in the us . 
  many still have living extended family living in finland , and some even speak finnish ( myself included ) . 
  this contrasts from people who are 3rd/4th/5th generation immigrants , who do n't really have any cultural/language/familial connection . 
  but , a lot of finns ( especially elderly finns ) are interested in family history , so from that pov , knock yourself out !, 
  4 ) reading your post history , you appear to be a self described ` cultural catholic ' , and appear to be anti-left , conservative . 
  spend a week in here in finland , perhaps in the helsinki area . 
  finland is a culturally secular , progressive social democracy , with a strong welfare state tradition , and you 'll see that the country works , and society here is n't falling apart . 
  helsinki/finland is actually really quite lovely during the summer . 
  it stays light out incredibly late , wood/smoke saunas at a summer cottage , sailing in the archipelago , and going out to enjoy nightlife when the sun is still up , and heading home when the sun is coming up is a great experience !, 
  eh , dual american-finn here , would say finnish political culture and american political culture are much different than one another . 
  difference here though , is unlike the colonials who were subject to ` taxation without representation ' , the finnish pm , whose party was elected by majority vote , supports the proposal . 
   and the idea of promoting the spread of liberty across the world ( which includes iraq ) is central to america 's traditional conception of itself . 
  maybe if senior us administration thought critically and altruistically when considering intervention , instead of relying on jingoism and false causus beli , then intervention would be more popular / more supported by the population . 
  i do n't think most americans would be opposed to ideals of helping other people in the world , but why should american lives and blood be spent to achieve those ends ? 
  i 'm not against your premise though , let 's take your example . 
  did n't south korea ask for international intervention against a clear foreign aggressor ? 
  and the war was wrapped up in about 3 years ? 
  that contrasts sharply with intervening against a dictator ( we support / have supported many dictatorships ) , who had weapons of mass destruction ( which did n't exist ) , who supported al qaeda ( who did n't ) . 
  this article is from october 2015 ... 
  finland has a large number of private security guards ( rent-a-cops ) . 
  mhm !, 
  i saw this originally in / r/upliftingnews , and the title made reference to finland 's policy , however , / r/europe has a title policy of not editorializing posts . 
   but swedes are more educated finland has scored higher than sweden in primary education ( pisa rankings ) for at least the past 16 years ( source upon request ) . 
   imagine the drop in intelligence when you tell people they 'll be looked after for life . 
  that they do n't even need to try . 
  nordic countries do very well on pisa ( international primary school test rankings ) and have had societal support for welfare states for over 60 years . 
  today , most supporters of most right-wing support the welfare state . 
  while not perfect , it is my opinion that the nordics set an example of how it could be done , and not just done , but done successfully . 
   i mean cmon how do you talk to a stranger in finland . 
  america has ( at least when i was living there ) much more stricter cultural mores regarding nudity than europe ; it has links with ` tradition ' , conservative culture , and religion . 
  i am colorblind as well , thanks for thinking of us !, 
  i completely agree !, 
   just pray that you do n't have any major health problems because the finnish public health care system is crap and overcrowded , i had to wait 6 months for a specialist and ended up having to seek private health care myself to get anything done in a reasonable timeframe . 
  ( disclaimer , i have a medical degree from a finnish university central hospital and work in academic medical research in finland ) . 
  * the standard of care of treatments for our specific sub-specialty , is on par with the rest of the world . 
  * many of the same physicians you see in the private sector in the evenings / weekends , are ones who would treat you in the public sector during the weekdays * despite what many people think , healthcare is a finite resource .
