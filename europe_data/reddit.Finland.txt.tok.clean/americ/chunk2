  as it is a finite resource , care has to be distributed somehow . 
  finland has elected to construct the public health service it currently has . 
  it is by no means perfect , but for a base-standard of care , it is better than none . 
  * additionally , many studies have been done on time from diagnosis - treatment . 
  it would be unethical / against the hippocratic oath to develop a system that does not treat patients in the best , evidence-based manner possible . 
  * there is absolutely nothing stopping you from going to the private sector . 
  you have that right , and i will defend that fiercely !, 
  err , i guess i ment , how is your life/career in latvia after moving back ? 
  more adversity or opportunity ? 
  easier / more difficult than finland ? 
  less rewarding or more rewarding ? 
  cool !, 
  are you able to put your degree to use in latvia ? 
   p.s. 
  i love your attitude about wanting to change your country for the better !, 
  where did you live in finland , and what field are you in ? 
   plus , when state employees post on facebook , he said , `` hierarchy is no longer respected . '' if the man is indeed doing his job and delivering results , then who cares about hierarchy ? 
  i want a police man that responds / gives traffic tickets , not an administrator telling me what he can/can ' t do . 
  tl ; dr fuck non-merit based hierarchy . 
  finland  netherlands ... ?
