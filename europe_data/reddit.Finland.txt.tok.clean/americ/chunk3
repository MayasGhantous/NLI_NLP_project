  the horse herders are excellent horse riders . 
  it seems like the men and the horses are grown together , and like that , they move with immense speed across the vast plains . 
  even the most populated villages have huge horse herds because even the owner of the smallest little piece of land has 6-8 horses . 
  to amuse themselves , the shepherds do all sorts of horseriding tricks such as riding fast with the horse and pick up something from the ground , or jumping from the back of one moving horse to another . 
  the cattle herders are usually not as swift . 
  they are generally quite sturdy and strong . 
  the sheep herders ( of the ` pusta ' ) , out of all of the herders of hungary , are the most content and friendly . 
  they can stand for hours leaning against their cane watching their herd eat . 
  sometimes , to kill time , they carve wooden spoons , or knit socks .

  ** ( spaniards ) ** - in the high plains , there are vast , lush , fields . 
  one can not see a single tree there . 
  the peasants can not stand trees . 
  they think that their leaves give shelter to the birds that eat their grains . 
  so they get rid of all the little birds except for the swallows . 
  and they try to demolish every tree as well , so there is no forest anywhere . 
  whoever travels in these regions , will soon be followed by beggars . 
  often , whole big herds of beggars rush after you , chasing your wagon . 
  some of them are almost naked . 
  they walk on sharp rocks of the roads with bare feet , holding their little children 's hands . 
  the blind is lead by the physically disabled , who can barely move themselves . 
  in spain , there is a lot of misery and poverty . 
  the biggest reason for this , is the spanish tendency for laziness . 
  but , despite everything , they are very proud , they think highly of themselves , mainly this applies to the noble , but , even in other levels of society , even to the lowest mule rider , you can observe the same , proud look in their eyes and a good posture .

  there , the shepard girls hang out with their cattle all summer and prepare butter and cheese out of milk , which is transported home down in the valley on the back of the horse in the fall .

  disclaimer : am a cancer researcher in finland . 
  here 's a relevant [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4g4eau/dutch_babies_born_healthier_since_smoking_ban_in/d2fc2yg/?context=3 ) about smoking that i wrote on / r/europe months ago . 
   `` it 's your own health you destroy , after all . '', 
   smoking is directly linked to increased risk of cancer . 
  treating cancer is not inexpensive . 
  in many european countries , the burden of paying for healthcare is shared by all members of society . 
  thus , an individual smoking will harm others by burdening others with the deferred health/economic costs til later in life . 
   take bladder cancer for [ example ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bladder_cancer ) . 
  it has the [ highest treatment per patient cost ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2694315/ ) of any cancer . 
  tobacco smoking is the [ most common risk factor in patients with bladder cancer ] ( http://jama.jamanetwork.com/mobile/article.aspx?articleid=1104233 ) . 
   it 's not just your own health you destroy , but you are literally taking taxpayer euros out of the pockets of your family , friends , and neighbors , when you choose to smoke .

  i am not a native speaker ** trump , brexit , a tough situation in the baltic sea . 
  nordic cooperation needs to interest other people than just paavo v\u00e4rynen . 
  i remember a clear moment , when i became a nord . 
  i was 17 years old , and my family had moved to england . 
  in the middle of the school year , i entered an international school . 
  i did n't know anyone , and i did n't know the language well . 
  at a student party , swedes and norwegians heard that there was a finn . 
  they took me under their shoulder like a fallen brother . 
  i learned in a few weeks , the words to the swedish national anthem . 
  nordic cooperation in 2017 is like a couple married at the diamond jubilee . 
  more cooperation came after ww2 . 
  the nordic union was founded in 1952 , and the leaders of the nordic countries signed agreements of freedom of movement , joint labor markets , and social questions . 
  the union picked up steam in the 1970 's , when they established the nordic union ministry . 
  then the the member states took different paths . 
  finland and sweden joined the eu in 1990 's , whereas denmark had already joined in 1973 . 
  now , the nords are enjoying the third golden age . 
  it 's a shame as cooperation would have a lot of demand !, 
  geopolitical attitudes are changing . 
  britain is leaving , the eu is falling apart . 
  russia is playing an ugly game in the baltics . 
  and the us nuclear codes have been given to an unpredictable bully . 
  the nordic paradox is , that nordism is favored more around the world than in the in the nordic countries themselves . 
  in nordic airports , there moves in the same blood delegations who arrive wondering , how can these same countries can be so highly ranked in all possible measures - be the question wellbeing , education , or equality . 
  the flattered nordic countris have already started the branding . 
  such concepts are artful words , such as ` nordic noir ' ( crime novels , series , and movies ) , nordic cuisine ( cuisine ) , nordic design ( design ) , and nordic cool ( vague category ) .
