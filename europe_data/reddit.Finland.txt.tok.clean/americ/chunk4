  these are marketing ( concepts ? ) . 
  why not speak of global ( harvinaisuushy\u00f6dykkeist\u00e4 ) than equality , peace , and the welfare state . 
  precedent for cooperation has a guidebook . 
  the swedish historian gunnar wetterberg suggested in 2009 , that the nordic countries should create a union state . 
  one that would have a single currency , joint labor markets , join foreign and defense policy , and joint immigration policy . 
  the states would practice cooperation in research , education , and culture . 
  a 26 million inhabitant superpower would be born , the worlds tenth largest economic power . 
  the union would be lead by danish queen margareeta ii . 
  this would be the same kummarus ( ? ), 
  as in the kalamar union , the unionstate , which was born , when danish and norwegian queen margareeta i was also selected to lead sweden in 1389 . 
  wetterberg 's idea was not without support . 
  polls indicated 40 % support amongst members of the nordic countries that would be possibly part of the nordic union . 
  previously , the unionstate model was discussed by the economist sixten korkman in a column in 2015 . 
  korkman did not think the idea realistic , but listed the benefits of closer nordic cooperation . 
  i do n't support a nordic federal state . 
  but i do support further cooperation in economics , science , defence policy , and culture between the nordic countries . 
  i also do not wish for the eu to break apart , as paavo v\u00e4rynen and a portion of populist nationalists do . 
  i wish for the nordic countries to raise their voices and show an example to the world : peaceful cooperation has power . 
  the nordic countries could have an open role in saving the eu , says risto e.j. 
  penttil\u00e4 , k-group [ finnish supermarket ] cep , who is preparing a book on the topic . 
  in penttil\u00e4 's mind , the nordic countries should `` be a lighthouse of liberalism and free market economics in europe '' . 
  nordic cooperation could be built on the 1962 helsinki agreement . 
  it should be updated , says penttil\u00e4 . 
  he supports the idea of a referendum , that finland has not done proper foreign policy since paavo lipponen 's time . 
  penttil\u00e4 says he as advertised the idea to prime minister sipil\u00e4 [ finnish pm ] and has already written and had speeches on the topic . 
  what is holding back further nordic cooperation ? 
  some belong to nato , some done . 
  some are in the eu , some are not . 
  one uses the euro , the others do n't . 
  the biggest issue is desire . 
  danes mourned brexit and norwegians are afraid that trump will break apart nato . 
  a rare sign of cooperation , is finnish and swedish joint-defence policy . 
  in all the nordic countries , internationalism is now out , and nationalism is in . 
  in the nest of populism , basic parties offer curling up from the problems of the world . 
  in finland , the same attitude is being taken towards non-finnish languages . 
  while politicians are shy , fortunately the citizens are not . 
  hundreds of thousands already have moved due to work or love from one nordic country to another . 
  it is nordism at its best . 
  they say it 's supposed to be open by april . 
  i walked by the above ground entrance to the otaniemi one during the christmas holiday , and it was actually quite nice looking !,

  [ wiki link ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/methicillin-resistant_staphylococcus_aureus ) . 
  methicillin = an antibiotic staphylococcus aureus = bacteria species common in human infections if i understand correctly , this is the percentage of mrsa detected in tests of antibiotic resistance in all staphylococcus aureus infections acquired in hospitals . 
  the star represents ` poor quality of data ' . 
  percentage of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) isolates in healthcare-associated infections in acute care hospitals in europe . 
  data from the years 2011-2012 . 
  original data from the european centre for disease prevention and control can be found [ here ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/healthcare-associated_infections/database/pages/hai-pps-database-microorganisms-antimicrobial-resistance.aspx ) . 
  the finnish doctor 's union also has a similar [ statement . 
  there is a trend amongst occupational health insurance providers as well . 
  while it can cost the health provider more money to provide multiple services as rapidly as possible , workplaces are willing to pay more to not lose productive workers to sick leave . 
  liberal interpretation of the physical location ( of modern successor states ) that poles fought in between 963-2017 , based on this list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland finland was a mistake though : the list has poland as an ally/belligerent in the war , but afaik , no polish troops were ever in finland . 
  `` polish military forces were part of the coalition forces that participated in the isaf mission in afghanistan led by nato . '',

  i then posted it to / r/dataisbeautiful , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5mms87/countries_poles_have_invadedoc/ ) . 
  i am more than certain i messed up the countries invaded , and would love to correct it .
