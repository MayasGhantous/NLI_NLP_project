finland is not a neutral state . 
   finland because related language and culture i love you too sweetie . 
  that 's why there are all those `` ie , ei , uo , ui , yi , ai ... '' etc in finnish words but not in the same words in estonian . 
  something similar but not quite the same happened to saami in southern finland as well . 
  it was even more radical , a vowel shift , for saami . 
  i do n't know what it 's about southern finland mixing up vowels in words ... :o, 
  silly estonian , you forgot the diphthong . 
  it 's `` tie '' . 
   i 'm an ignorant twat . 
  ftfy . 
  100 0000 m2 100 00 are 100 hectare 1 km2, 
  controversial ? 
  what is this ? 
  the immigration situation in europe and neighbouring regions is in a state of mess . 
  north africa , sahel and the middle east are increasingly unstable regions with a massively growing population in many countries . 
  there 's war in north africa , war in ukraine , war in the middle east , frozen conflicts in transnistria and the caucasus , economic hardship and uncertainty and a growing young population in many of these regions . 
  it has lead to disaster and it 's only going to get worse in the coming decades . 
  regions bordering europe are unstable and the eu has no answers to these problems . 
  i suspect we 'll just wait and see the problems become worse and worse and create a fortress europe in the end . 
  providing family planning and birth control to many of these regions would be a cheap way to prevent problems in the future . 
  the population growth trends in the sahel , for example , are simply unsustainable and will lead to problems . 
  we could help them now instead of paying more for it in the future . 
  do n't worry . 
  many of the loanwords are so old ( from proto-germanic or proto-baltic or even older ) that it 's difficult for native speakers too to know if its a loan word or not without the help of an etymological dictionary . 
  modern ones like `` televisio '' , `` radio '' or `` internet '' are obvious but older ones like `` lattia '' ( compare modern english or swedish `` flat '' ) are not so obvious . 
  i lub you . 
  you 're both cute . 
  se on kivaa * partitive case . 
  yup from gothic . 
  `` em\u00e4 '' would be the finnish word for mother . 
  also notice `` emo '' for animal mothers . 
  in estonian mother is still `` ema '' . 
  i have no idea how it got borrowed . 
  maybe the word got loaned by a group of finnic speakers on the coast and then spread from them . 
  i 'm no linguist but i 've done some reading on my own . 
  i 'm not a 100 % sure . 
  i guess it could be from swedish too . 
  does n't matter because they were borrowed from swedish and german , not from latin or greek . 
  they 're not all swedish-words . 
  many germanic loanwords predate swedish and are actually loans from proto-germanic . 
  the reason for this is that when proto-finnic language arrived at the gulf of finland around 3 000 years ago ( 1 000 bce + ) there were already some proto-germanic speaking people living on the coast of modern day finland . 
  these people then mixed with the finnic speakers giving us much of their vocabulary . 
  there was no swedish back then . 
  swedish loanwords are two millenia older . 
  i made a cute little map of this : http://i.imgur.com/7y3eprq.png saami is wrong but it 's close enough . 
  interesing reading for finnish-speakers about the language history of finland : http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/kielet_suomessa_kautta_aikain.pdf, 
  not always though . 
  * sammas could be older , from proto-indo-aryan . 
  idk, 
  found the german . 
  ya , they all say that . 
  correct . 
  oh please . 
   it 's almost germanic in finnish too : `` viini '' a loanword from swedish `` kumi '' a loanword from german `` lakritsi '' from swedish `` ja '' from proto-germanic `` makeinen '' from `` makea '' or `` sweet '' in finnish , originally from proto-germanic `` vaahto '' and `` sekoitus '' i 'm not sure of , could possibly be loans from 2000 + years ago from proto-germanic or baltic . 
  idk, 
   hello / r/europe i am greek hey babe . 
  finnish surnames : korhonen ( rich , proud or possibly deaf , mentally slow ) virtanen ( stream ) m\u00e4kinen ( hill ) nieminen ( cape ) m\u00e4kel\u00e4 ( hill ) h\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen ( tavastian ) laine ( wave ) heikkinen ( heikki , a finnish first name ) koskinen ( rapid ) j\u00e4rvinen ( lake ) first names are boring . 
  - nen or - inen is just something you put in a surname , like a diminutive i guess . 
  some linguists even group ugric and samoyed as ugric-samoyed branching off from proto-uralic . 
  there probably was no finno-ugric proto-language so it does n't make sense to classify languages as if there was one . 
  also karelians in karelia . 
  uralic big !, 
  finno-ugric is an outdated term . 
  uralic should be used instead . 
  finno-ugric excludes the samoyed languages but according to 21st century research there 's no reason to do so . 
  there was no early split into finno-ugric and samoyed branches from proto-uralic . 
  that does n't say much . 
  things have changed after 2008 . 
  our gdp has n't grown in 7 years . 
  unemployment keeps going up . 
  for the next ten years 2016-2025 predicted growth is 1 % per year . 
  it 's going to be a difficult decade . 
  long term predictions for 2026-2035 are n't much better with 1,2 % yearly growth predicted . 
  i hope they are relocated back to where they came from . 
  i do n't give a fuck about your faith . 
  your faith does n't get to dictate laws . 
  want different laws ? 
  piss off . 
  respect the laws or fuck off . 
   the issue is that you have a group of frustrated , alienated young men who do n't understand the cultural expectations they 're living under . 
  why are they here then ? 
  they do n't belong here . 
  black africans belong in africa , not here . 
  blacks will never be finns , they 'll always be others . 
  they are supposed to go back to africa once the war or whatever is over . 
  i do n't understand why are blacks let to come live in the country ... 
  why are blacks , muslims and russians let into the country ? 
  they add nothing to society but cause problems . 
  * balt ftfy . 
  happy summer solstice !, 
  roma and gays are ok . 
  blacks , muslims and russians can fuck off tho . 
  borders should be closed for such people . 
  after clicking that link it took me five seconds to realise i was n't having another migraine attack but the text was just in greek . 
  ca n't comment on the article but the way i 've seen medical companies promote their products , here in finland , is by arranging short training to doctors and nurses . 
  if you take part in the training/promotion of their products they 'll pay for your dinner . 
  sometimes they have longer 1-2 day trainings with lectures and all , meals and accommodation provided of course . 
  they also visit wards directly and bring bakeries to the staff along with the product they 're promoting and give a short presentation why it 's such a good medication/product to use while the staff is enjoying their coffee break . 
  is this corruption ? 
  maybe , maybe not .
