  i mean what kind of a country uses paid trolls to spread propaganda on social media ? 
  it 's fucking pathetic , is n't it ? 
  no one likes you . 
  you 're a fucking shitty neighbour to have , a real pain in the rear . 
  no one wants your shitty eurasian union . 
  all you have is belarus and kazashktan . 
  dictatorships . 
  pathetic . 
  even they 're having second thoughts because of your cunt of a president . 
  even fucking _ dictatorships _ do n't want your union . 
  your closest allies ? 
  what does that tell you ? 
  pathetic . 
  you 're at war in ukraine and your president keeps lying to you about it . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  he 's so afraid of euromaidan and a western oriented democratic ukraine he 's sacrifising young russian lives to quell it . 
  he 's so afraid of a maidan in his own country he has to lie about people dying for their country . 
  young russians who died for their country are silently buried and the anguish of their families suffocated . 
  a real patriot . 
  a coward he is . 
  you had your man in kiev . 
  everything was just fine and putin fucked it all up . 
  now young russians are paying it in their blood . 
  for what ? 
  for economic misery , more distrust between peoples , more lies , more propaganda , more useless deaths . 
  a bleak future , a victim complex . 
  that 's breeding ground for fascism . 
  that is exatcly what putin is delivering and young russians have to pay for it in their blood . 
  see [ gensek ] on armas . 
  deal with it . 
  i 've lived in eastern finland ( savolaismurteet ) all my life . 
  no one uses `` h\u00e4n '' in spoken language . 
  there 's nothing impolite about using `` it '' . 
  i 'm glad you and us did get out . 
  no no , we have a great relationship . 
  a special relationship like the finlandised folk like to call it . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  just a week ago a close advisor to putin said in komsomolskaja pravda : `` friendship is over [ between finland and russia ] '' `` finland is becoming a border state which is going to face a national catastrophe '' `` stubb [ our prime minister ] is basically an american '' the soviet union was a friendly neighbour and the soviet union helped finland '' [ finland ] does n't have much to offer : forests , lakes and rocks . 
  hardly any population , no oil , no gas , no nuclear weapons '' finland will face economic hardship and emigration `` they [ finland ] want a little war with us '' http://yle.fi/uutiset/putinin_lahipiirilainen_tylyttaa_suomea_reunavaltio_jota_odottaa_kansallinen_katastrofi/7922234 we 're getting along just fine with our friendly neighbour . 
  which are being oppressed and are dying . 
  in proto-finnic there was no `` h\u00e4n '' , was just `` se '' . 
  that 's why it sounds more natural , it is more ` natural ' . 
  some things take a long time to die in languages . 
  `` se '' will ` never ' , not any time soon atleast , die out . 
  who knows `` h\u00e4n '' might become totally archaic in the next hundred years and be replaced by `` se '' if things go the way they 're going . 
  my post was n't supposed to be humorous . 
  :o i 'm confused ... @_ @, 
  we do n't even use `` h\u00e4n '' or `` he/she '' that often . 
  in spoken language `` se '' which translates to `` it '' is more common . 
  `` it '' is perfect . 
  you can use it with anything , an object , a human , an animal , your wife etc. 
  `` where is your wife ? '', 
  `` it is ... '' perfect . 
  assault rifles that you can aim with in the dark . 
  the current ones ( rk-62 ) are badly worn-out and lack proper sights . 
  i wish finland did the same . 
  we have plenty of politicians with past links to kgb ans stasi in politics today . 
  these same politicians used the intelligence services to cover up their past in early 2000s . 
  they need to go . 
  finland declared itself neutral . 
  what do you expect other countries to do ? 
  come rushing for aid ? 
  sign a sudden military alliance . 
  not going to happen . 
  did you expect finland to rush for norway 's aid when it was attacked by germany ? 
  why expect any more from them either ? 
  yeah . 
  it 's bad . 
  i do n't expect the immediate future to be any better . 
  sucks . 
  i suggest you read some of the actual text . 
  about europe :  climate temperatures will almost certainly increase across the region , with a rise in extreme weather events such as the 2003 heatwave ( which caused over 35,000 deaths ) . 
  rainfall patterns will probably change , with northern europe becoming wetter in winter and mediterranean regions becoming significantly drier , particularly in summer months . 
  droughts are likely to increase in number , particularly in the central and southern regions . 
  rising sea levels could have significant impacts for several major low-lying cities particularly in the netherlands . 
  ( page 119 ) today 's extremes will become the new norm . 
   agriculture and fisheries the climatic effect on agriculture will probably have a significant impact on future yields . 
  significant decreases in yields in the southern regions are expected due to water shortages and increasing temperatures , with small decreases in the central regions , and increases in the north . 
  europe is likely to remain self-sufficient for arable and livestock production , although many european people may be concerned about food security . 
  technological advancements , such as more efficient desalinisation plants , are likely to mitigate water shortages in the mediterranean area , and genetically modified crops are likely to become increasingly widespread ( despite opposition from environmentalists ) , allowing continued production as temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change . 
  warming of the oceans , due to climate change , may affect fish migration and could lead to the collapse of some fisheries in european waters . 
  there may also be tension over fishing rights , particularly in the north atlantic , as non-european fishing fleets seek to operate in the area . 
  ( page 119-120 ) it 's a known fact that , when temperature goes up 1c after a certain optimal point , yields go down 10 per cent . 
  possible droughts do n't help either . 
   shock : rise of a european power if a european country financially out-performed the rest of the eu to a significant extent , domestic political concerns could prompt the country 's leaders to use its leverage to dominate europe not only economically but also politically , severely challenging the eu 's cohesion . 
  in such a situation , europe could split between those countries who are dependent on the large power and those who resent its influence . 
  there is a risk that nato could become less effective , as european countries may place loyalty or opposition to the economic power above any other alliances . 
  this is talking about germoney . 
  russia realises this . 
  there 's a reason why they want talk with merkel and not other eu-leaders . 
  they want to create a division inside the eu by doing so . 
  i 've barely scratched the surface but there 's so much fascinating stuff to read in this report . 
  thanks for posting this . 
  this is some scary shit . 
  they do n't have very optimistic predictions on how we 're going to cut emissions in the future . 
  global energy demand by source : ( page 25 ) http://i.imgur.com/g3ncxpl.png annual co2 emitted per capita : ( page 32 , there seems to be an error with the colous of 2025 and 2035 ) http://i.imgur.com/d7ezsye.png  shock : catastrophic climate change if advances in energy technology are insufficient to ensure the required amounts of electricity for economic growth , ** countries could burn hydrocarbons at ever-higher rates . 
  ** this may increase greenhouse gas levels , causing global temperature rise . 
  in turn , this could lead to long heat waves in normally temperate latitudes . 
  sustained drought could contribute to repeated harvest failures , as arable crops would be unable to cope with the high temperatures . 
  severe food shortages could lead to sudden mass migration of populations across national borders , triggering ** widespread social unrest .
