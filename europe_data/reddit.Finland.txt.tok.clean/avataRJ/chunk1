it 's designed to keep firing a rocket to keep contacts . 
  the comet is too small for any meaningful gravity , the legs exist partially to try and grapple the rock . 
  residence laws . 
  another example is [ \u00c5land islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85land_islands ) in the baltic . 
  officially part of finland , they enjoy considerable autonomy . 
  getting so-called `` home region rights '' in \u00c5land is not a simple matter . 
  also , they are an eu member thru finland , but are taxed as if they were a foreign country . 
  ( a lot of passenger ferries between turku/helsinki , finland and stockholm , sweden stop briefly in \u00c5land - this allows them to keep the tax free shops open . ), 
  remember the political officer murdered right in the beginning ? 
  you may want to check what his name was . 
  probably just a coincidence ; though vladimir vladimirovich 's father was a submariner . 
  and then there is the curious case of the [ storozhevoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_frigate_storozhevoy ) . 
  some of the towns in the countryside are essentially company towns . 
  when the factory goes down , that affects almost everyone there . 
  not yet a mass migration , and some old factories have been repurposed , e.g. 
  the former paper mill housing a datacenter at hamina , but the ones that have been built into less advantageous locations ( some with state subsidies or originally as state-owned companies ) are in trouble . 
  for a country of five million , i understand that the capital region is expected to breach two million before 2050 . 
  there 's now 1.4 million people there , so a 10 - 20 thousand people per year . 
  finland post ww2 was still a special effort because of moving 1/3 of the entire population - nowhere near that , though the approach ( `` let 's offer small farms to these people '' ) probably would n't work too well these days . 
  finland industrialized after ww2 , since the allies ( i.e. 
  soviet union ) demanded reparations as industrial goods . 
  the news are a bit silly . 
  sure , there 's a lot of talk of this now and they 'll need to start to select a new plane soon-ish , but i think they 're planned to have the planes operative in the 2020s . 
  i guess someone in the ministry of defense smelled money now that the parliament for some reason seems to think increasing defense spending is a good idea , and tries to get the funds into the budget . 
  lots of people still in finland use the `` neutral '' policial rhetoric , but officially , finland is no longer `` neutral '' . 
  the current term is `` militarily non-allied '' or something like that . 
  if there were n't an election coming , the national coalition would be probably very keen to change that . 
  unemployment would be one a bit more urgent one . 
  we 're not yet having full-blown bangkokization , but a whole lot of jobs end up moving towards the capital from the countryside . 
  combine that with the nice trend of increasing shortage of apartments in helsinki , and this will lead to an increased amount of homeless people in finland . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's fun being homeless in some other country , but being homeless in the winters of the north is just brutal . 
  in 1916 , the social democratic party of the grand duchy of finland got 103 seats in the parliament . 
  the parliament took very long until it could assemble . 
  there were some minor things , like our head of state abdicating . 
  with the throne vacant , the parliament got a really good idea to declare themselves as the highest authority in the grand duchy of finland . 
  the russian provincial government said nope , and thus that parliament made two records : the only parliament where one party had a simple majority , and the shortest parliament thus far ( seven months in session - consider that it took nine months to assemble the parliament ) . 
  oh dear , have n't seen that in quite some time . 
  the person asking the question is [ dr. luukanen-kilde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rauni-leena_luukanen-kilde ) . 
  admitted , she is n't best known her work as a physician . 
  i was somewhat amused to note that our local supermarket sells komsomolskaya pravda . 
  no , i do not live in russia ( though not terribly far from the border ) . 
  back in 2012 , with the mayan stuff and all , some people started circulating the weather forecast of utsjoki ( northernmost town of finland ) . 
  you see , finnish meteorological institute does list sunrise and sunset in its predictions . 
  except that in december , it cheerfully notes for northern lapland that '' [ the sun does not rise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polar_night ) '' . 
  now , estonia at least has been economically very successful . 
  however , population-wise they 're around 1.3 million or so . 
  for comparison , that 's a bit smaller than san diego , ca and a bit larger than dallas , tx . 
  and oh , about one fourth of that population is russian as a legacy of the soviet times . 
  talking about soviet times and military , when estonians finally got the russian military to leave after becoming independent , i do believe the withdrawing units took with them from the bases everything that was n't bolted down , and most of what was bolted down , and probably destroyed a lot of what was left for the good measure . 
  estonians probably agree with you - since they 've got the control of the bases in their own territory , they 've been pouring money to modernize the [ \u00c4m\u00e4ri air base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%84mari_air_base ) . 
  probably takes a decade or so to buy their own fighters , though , but since 2012 they 've actually had an air base . 
  active service numbers do n't really tell much in countries which use the cadre system . 
  the question is , how fast can the active reserve be activated and how well is it trained . 
  in the case of finland , a good number of `` peacekeepers '' are reservists . 
  commanders might be career military . 
  no idea if the same model is followed on the other side of the gulf . 
  i believe that there 's enough pressure in the pipes to keep the essential stuff going a fair bit longer . 
  especially when a lot of stuff can manage with alternative sources - or , in a pinch , they could probably ( at an ugly cost ) make gas from other petrochemicals at the porvoo refinery . 
  ( yes , there is an oil refinery in finland . ), 
  [ one of the local profs estimates that for the first month there would be issues for some industrial and heating plants . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/tutkija_suomi_ei_ole_kriittisesti_riippuvainen_venajan_tuontienergiasta/7423128 ) i do seem to remember than when one of the public buildings had gas heating installed at my old home town in the nineties , one of the questions was `` what happens if the ruskies shut the pipes '' . 
  ( probably an exact quote , it was run by quite conservative people . ), 
  that flag is probably also a heraldic nightmare . 
  because if we follow the western traditions , there are rules on what to put on flags or arms . 
  as far as i understand , with nato countries there are few important distinctions . 
  first , in the gulf of finland , it might not be entirely unplausible that the russian planes were actually just off-course . 
  okay , it 'd tell us pretty bad things about the state of glonass , but still remotely possible . 
  the strip of international airspace is quite narrow . 
  second , russian planes use those routes to travel from leningrad oblast to kaliningrad , and there is literally no other route ( since non-civilian aircraft ca n't take a shortcut over the baltic states ) . 
  third , the craft were within finnish airspace . 
  now , around america or scotland there 's a wealth of international airspace , so anyone coming close has no real excuse . 
  in most cases ( unless the russians get a base in cuba ) the planes ca n't be on a ferry flight . 
  and as far as i am aware , russian state aircraft have not actually entered american or british airspace and have been met by interceptors at the border . 
  one of the probable reasons for relocating fighters is that the finnish air force is n't equipped to keep an interceptor in the air 24/7 , and that would be necessary if they 'd go shadow all the russian air traffic close to the border . 
  if they 're having planes closer , they might manage to scramble in time to go say hello . 
  ( this would be a bad idea if they were under fire , because they would n't have time to react if the base came under attack . ), 
  usaf might see a plane coming a few hundred klicks away over the pacific - in fiaf 's case , the distance from helsinki ( finland , north of the gulf of finland ) and tallinn ( estonia , south of the gulf ) is 82 km . 
  this includes some finnish airspace , a narrow corridor of international airspace , and some estonian airspace . 
  ( edited for spelling . ), 
  in finland , the military has quite a lot of other airfields and if those are not enough , prepared highways to be used for runways - as bases , that is , not for emergencies only . 
  so seeing fighters on the largest commercial airport is slightly unusual . 
  ( my best guess would be that they save a bit by using already in place commercial infrastructure . ), 
  yes , original headline is `` finnish air force moves hardware to helsinki-vantaa airport ; public reports hornet sightings '' . 
  as they would not specify what the other airstrips are , hard to know . 
  deploying some to helsinki makes sense because most likely airspace violations with somewhat plausible deniability happen next to the narrow corridor of international airspace between finland and estonia ( helsinki is quite close , and has the infrastructure ready ) . 
  third for a week , and it 's an unarmed plane over the sea . 
  the default response is probably to id and escort the plane out if necessary . 
  notably , the finnish interceptors were this time in the air already ( last time we had a spree of `` lost '' russian planes , interceptors needed to go supersonic to get into visual range of the planes as they were leaving finnish airspace ) . 
  you may consider different response between swedish submarine hunts and finnish equalents - in sweden , these were much publicized , and the military responded with live depth charges and mines . 
  in finland , we officially do n't have many incidents - but that 's because what counts as a detected sub here is if the navy or the coast guard can get a picture of the vessel , so suspected detections and other `` operational data '' is n't publicly discussed . 
  e : oh , i understand within the last week there has been some submarine traffic spotted on the gulf of finland , too . 
  as long as the subs are surfaced , they 've considered just a regular ship , though - these ones were spotted from [ civilian passenger ferries ( finnish article , mobile phone pic of a kilo class sub ) ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288729642970.html ) . 
  [ and then there 's this one ( article in finnish ) . 
  ] ( http://www.ts.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/669944/merivoimat+kohtasi+venalaisen+sukellusveneen ) for clarification : both subs were in international waters ( the sub that got a visit from a finnish fast attack craft barely so ) . 
  notable that fsb , like its predecessor kgb , also includes border guards - this plane apparently is registered as a border guard plane . 
  of course , it is n't like the border guards could n't have `` surveillance equipment '' on board . 
  ( i am relatively certain that when finnish officials conduct aerial survey of forest growth near the border , they may `` accidentally '' snap a few pictures of what 's happening on the other side of the border . ), 
  the finnish territory back then was essentially one big forest , limiting soviet mobility combined with questionable operations , most famously having [ two divisions surrounded and defeated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_suomussalmi ) and then the [ division that was sent to relieve them getting surrounded and defeated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_raate_road ) . 
  ( also , i understand that at least the 44th was issued summer gear for operations in northern finland - the battle happened in december . ), 
  now , ukraine 's territory is more or less entirely part of the european plains .
