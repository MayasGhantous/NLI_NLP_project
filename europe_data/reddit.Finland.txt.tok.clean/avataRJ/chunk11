  however , some parts of the building might have got some moisture , and then it turns out that the a/c literally sucks - that is , sucks the spores and mold from the structures into the breathing air . 
  and in case of new relatively airtight buildings , in order to keep the building dry and functional , it 's been designed to run a/c 24/7 , but people wanting to save money instead shut down a/c after office hours , so the building is completely unventilated for 2/3 of the time . 
  there 's also an issue where too tight building schedules ( especially when the constructor is paid a lump sum for the building ) mean that cast concrete structures and the like might not be completely dry before they get covered up by layers of insulation , and so the moisture gets trapped in the structures . 
  and before long , something starts to grow on that moisture and the problem starts to bloom . 
  the walls are thick enough to retain heat . 
  though this might be the last of its kind , as new tighter regulations for energy efficiency in public buildings more or less disallow the use of common logs for building material and require more complex insulation . 
  ( nothing learned from the times of the oil crisis when we started building non-breathing bottles for houses , if you ask me . ), 
  yes , the finnish school is finished . 
  the unpainted-looking sections are probably treated by some kind of clear finish . 
  in finland , the siren would go off for real also for major industrial disasters . 
  ( would need to be pretty big , though . ), 
  i think the building codes were recently changed , but old buildings do still have quite a few shelters . 
  ( only the big communal ones are built to be nukeproof , and even those only for non-direct hits . ), 
  economies of scale . 
  when the process is heavily mechanised , the amount of work that goes to a single ton of goods is very low . 
  compared to the farmer himself picking up and packaging the produce manually , the loading them up to his pick-up and driving to the market . 
  also , in some cases the large chains are able to buy kind of `` left overs '' - still good quality produce , but it 's cheaper for the seller to sell them at a discount than keep them in a warehouse . 
  this is probably less notable with nuts and more significant in products that do n't keep well - or do n't keep at all . 
  ( electric markets - if it costs a lot to shut down a power plant , for short periods of time it is cost-effective for the power company to pay someone so that they 'll receive the electricity . ), 
  actually , underwater rugby is a separate diving sport . 
  a couple of friends used to play - it is a lot more popular in finland compared to water polo . 
  well , the torygraph is n't necessarily impartial , but they ran [ this piece of news ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/12077703/turkeys-president-says-all-he-wants-is-same-powers-as-hitler.html ) on the first of january this year . 
   in a statement that surprised even his critics , mr erdogan responded to arguments that putting political power in the hands of the presidency would not work in a `` unitary state '' . 
  he said there were other examples of its being successful . 
  `` there are already examples in the world , '' he said . 
  `` you can see it when you look at hitler 's germany . 
  there are later examples in various other countries . '', 
  i do n't know turkish law , but at least back home there are different grades to state of emergency , from relatively mild to `` the government decided to ask the parliament to suspend democracy for six months '' that comes with full articles of the state of defense act . 
  so , it might be that they declare a state of emergency to allow the police to keep anyone arrested for as long as they want without trial . 
  ( which , admittedly , is pretty heavy-handed . ), 
  edit : [ elsewhere in this discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tt7th/erdo%c4%9fan_declares_state_of_emergency/d5k2ufl?st=iqvz22lq&amp;sh=a113c15e ), 
  if he does n't work in the turkish public sector , probably not , though i understand that there 's additional checks on all leaving turkish citizens ' papers on the border . 
  ( public sector workers and all university staff have been told not to leave - so for foreign university staff members the situation is probably a bit ambiguous right now until someone tries leaving and we 'll see what happens . ), 
  [ mv artic sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mv_arctic_sea ) managed to evade communications for more than three weeks . 
  hijacked on the baltic sea , no less - if the russian owners would have reported that , it 'd been probably difficult to get thru the danish straits . 
  iirc , even in the 90s publicly doing missionary work in turkey was illegal . 
  had religious friends who did visit ; apparently they went to church in the swedish embassy . 
  the wikipedia article cites two books for the ming reformation , [ passing of the manchus ] ( https://books.google.fi/books?id=ldzaaaaayaaj&amp;pg=pa382&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) and [ the search for a vanishing beijing ] ( https://books.google.fi/books?id=tmmvxx67fpic&amp;pg=pa176&amp;dq=marquis+of+extended+grace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=dtvdt92hn6qy6qglvmizcw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=marquis%20of%20extended%20grace&amp;f=false ) , the latter of which is visible in google books . 
  correct , though i believe that when qing fell , there was talk of installing the marquis of zhu ( i.e. 
  ming ) or duke yansheng ( confucius 's descendants ) as the emperor before founding the republic . 
  byzantine , no . 
  the last holy roman emperor became the first emperor of austria , so technically karl von habsburg could claim to be a successor of charlemagne . 
  probably not amongst the most likely of claims . 
  additional imperial pretenders : [ jin yuzhang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jin_yuzhang ) is technically the pretender to the great qing . 
  i do n't think that we can trace who would be the [ marquis of extended grace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marquis_of_extended_grace ) though the [ house of zhu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_zhu#modern_era ) of the emperors of the great ming appears to do quite well . 
  apparently the military did n't want to go all tiananmen in support of the coup , so while the situation is anything but clear right now , the crowd and the police is disarming the soldiers they 've caught and it looks like the coup is failing . 
  fox at least is streaming it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mq5hrudoyo ( apparently both having the same source / audio ? ), 
  government / president / akp party on one side , apparently with most of the army and the police as well . 
  a group of soldiers attempting the coup ; political affiliation unclear . 
  the turkish government is blaming supporters of a moderate politician fethullan g\u00fclen , some of whose supporters deny this . 
  g\u00fclen lives in the u.s. right now . 
  the kurds probably do n't like erdogan , but have more to fear from the army being in control . 
  reports were of a helicopter being shot down . 
  the helicopter was shooting police , so the jets would be on the government side . 
  we 'll probably see military on both sides , so maybe a show of force just in case some of the folks involved in the coup might be trying to get erdogan ? 
  sonic boom means fast overflight . 
  going over the speed of sound is loud . 
  probably includes countries which allowed passage or intermediate stops of cia/state aircraft . 
  i do seem to remember from finnish media that there was a minor scandal over a plane that `` may have been carrying prisoners '' . 
  in this case , i assume the designs will be more or less like the n1 tablet . 
  but yeah , most of the engineering will be probably outsourced , and maybe they 'll have someone coordinating design . 
  in `` feature phones '' , the contract lasts longer . 
  the smartphone contract is already over . 
  so , android phones are free game for nokia to license to someone . 
  ( it helps that foxconn is behind the venture , too , so they 'll be able to coordinate all nokia-branded phones with hmd . ), 
  when they sold the phones to microsoft . 
  and to be quite frank , it 'll be foxconn making the phones , with maybe the design coming from ex-nokians from hmd . 
  i assume than in many places the people 's front of judea / judean people 's front thing has happened as well and finnish comrades are n't really unique in not fitting in a single party . 
  ( let 's ignore the wealth of leftist parties that have disbanded , merged or otherwise no longer exist . ), 
  thanks for the correction - did an on-the-fly literal translation without actually checking what the parties officially call themselves in english . 
   i 've been giggling all night . 
  ... no offense meant , but i 'd suggest sleep deprivation may be a factor . 
  ( not that i would n't have been somewhat happy with the local results . ), 
  eh , there 's a lot of former young finns ( liberals ) in the greens . 
  while there are ex-commies in the greens as well , they 're not terribly far in the left - i 'd reserve that for skp ( finnish communist party ) , ktp ( communist worker 's party ) and maybe the left alliance . 
  for foreigners : yup , there 's three parties with the roots in the old communists in finland . 
  left alliance is the most mainstream one , somewhat recently taken over by `` academic left '' , though still having a few of its strongholds of old school communists left . 
  ( interestingly , they lost in kotka - one of the places in finland which still has a public outdoor statue of one vladimir lenin . ), 
  i think those are included , not the netherl ** a ** nds . 
  i think it is was a joke in the swedish-speaking community in finland that to speak finnish , just append - i to the end of the word . 
  since old style finnish likes to end words in vowels , lots of older loan words were formed essentially that way . 
  finns say `` saksa '' ( `` germany '' , probably from saksi `` saxony '' ) and `` saksalaiset '' ( `` germans '' ) . 
  estonia is similarly `` viro '' , from the virumaa province and sweden is `` ruotsi '' from roden/roslagen area . 
  the pinyin `` q '' is roughly the same as wade-giles `` ch ' '' . 
  similarly , as the alcohol prices are getting more expensive in estonia , some finns have taken sudden interest in latvian tourism . 
  there 's this concept called `` conscription '' , which often involves something called `` reservists '' . 
  depending on the system , the so-called `` reserves '' may be occasionally called back for training or even operations . 
  so , not sure if it 'd be a part-time job or something a bit more traditional . 
  in finland there are the `` local defense troops '' which are actively-training reserve organizations . 
  at least finnish defense force ads are occasionally ... creative . 
  aggravated assault , unless a higher court finds otherwise . 
  i do n't buy the `` nazis were provoked , so totally the victim 's fault '' crap , but it did n't help for the victim to leave hospital and take some non-prescribed chemical assitance of his own . 
  i was expecting [ something else ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fxmtwkzmsts/tpdrv7i901i/aaaaaaaac9e/dchcvnnblce/s1600/monty-python-spanish-inquisition.jpg ) . 
  well , the district court did hand him the `` go directly to jail . 
  do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 '' card , but he can still keep the process alive for quite some time . 
  first a republic ( according to the declaration of independence ) , but before that really took off , there was civil war , and what with a lot of the republic-leaning leftists being in jail the parliament thought that having a strong king would be a good idea and keep the riff-raff at bay . 
  ( seriously , social democrats - which back then included communists - had 92 seats of 200 in the parliament , with [ one representative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matti_paasivuori ) not being in jail suspected of treason . ), 
  well , they also wanted to select a king from germany to seal the alliance in a true crusader kings manner ( with the germans helping the government/whites against the reds ) , but unfortunately , the germans happened to lose the great war . 
  at which point there was considerable uncertainty of how the allied powers would respond to der kaiser being deposed in germany but one of his relatives becoming king in another country . 
  the potential diplomatic crisis was defused when the king-elect did not accept the crown .
