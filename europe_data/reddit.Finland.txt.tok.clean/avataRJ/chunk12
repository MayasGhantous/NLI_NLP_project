  and yes , to elect a king , the parliament went back not to russian , but old swedish laws about the end of the dynasty . 
  despite being part of the russian empire , the grand duchy of finland had retained much of the swedish legislation , and technically , the [ swedish constitution of 1772 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_constitution_of_1772 ) had never been repealed . 
  so , royal election . 
  they first planned to have one of the german emperor 's sons , but did n't get acceptance , as finland was seen as too unstable . 
  as a compromise , after it all came falling down , the president had a very , very strong office - with some people joking that finland was the only nordic monarchy . 
  the other nordic countries had mostly-ceremonial constitutional monarchs , and finland had a very strong president . 
  while some preparations were made for the coronation , the crown itself was never made . 
  ( and the regent mannerheim could enjoy `` being the king '' until they established the republic . ), 
  they 've made a replica of the crown . 
  also , the inheritance of the crown is not clear - whether the title would be with the head of house hesse or pass to a cadet branch ( assuming der kaiser 's relatives would prefer to be in germany ) . 
  do n't worry . 
  parts of the service workers ' union already threatened to strike . 
  probably no good for anyone , but would n't they be happy to stick it up the man after the government acted as a corporate lapdog on the `` social contract '' negotiations . 
  if mr. sipil\u00e4 deals with that situation as hamfisted as he did with this ( writing letters to people you do n't like might 've worked for kekkonen , but that was in the bad old days ) , we 're going to have our share of problems soon enough . 
  i 'd guess that the moldarse swamp that 's used by the reserve officer school for field exercises would be the most famous one . 
  i believe the limit mentioned elsewhere in the thread is 5 kg of processed dairy for personal consumption , and if you bring more than that , you 're an importer by russian regulations . 
  there was some speculation about 100 kg being the limit , but that is apparently for unpasteurized products . 
  sanctions , counter-sanctions , counter-counter sanctions etc. 
  to be brief , blame european gay fascists from repressing the people of the motherland . 
  ( note : not to be mixed with european straight patriots funded by the motherland ) . 
  did you intend to comment with a link to the actual image instead of a link to the thumbnail ? 
  for countries not listed , this applies :  there is , however , one small exception . 
  if you are traveling to st. petersburg for up to 72 hours on a cruise ship ( on the condition that you are sleeping on the ship and are accompanied by an authorized tour guide ) or on ferries from helsinki and tallinn with st. peter line , you do not need a visa . 
  there has been talk of extending this privilege to passengers on the allegro train from helsinki , but to date train passengers still need to get a visa . 
  to find out more about visa-free travel for up to 72 hours , see our visas for cruise ship passengers and ferry passengers pages . 
  correct . 
  if you are on a cruiseboat or a cruiseferry making a port call in st. petersburg , you can visit the city visa free . 
  [ some conditions apply .

  yeah , old wikipedia sources for the prices of the older planes . 
  the $ 6b offer is from a probably non-neutral canadian ( ? ), 
  [ blog ] ( http://gripen4canada.blogspot.fi/p/the-saab-gripen-ng-capable-and.html ) . 
  it 'd make sense it 's in cad , though i would n't think it too unbelievable that for some reason it 's in usd , which would already bump up the price . 
  also now that i checked the blog date , it 's 2013 - so back then the gripen-e was still vapourware . 
  now that it 's actually flown , we 'll start to get better price estimates . 
  however , if something that is still a budget fighter costs more than the eurofighter , then someone has done something terribly wrong . 
  though i guess the old gripen 's price was pushed down by the secure buy from the swedish air force . 
   projected to drop to 80mil by 2020 . 
  that 's cheaper than the gripen , rafale and typhoon . 
  i did n't quickly find any clear projections on the price of the gripen-e . 
  it 's clearly a different beast than the gripen-c ( which costs about $ 40m - you can get two old school gripens at the price of one budget f35 ) . 
  apparently , saab offered canada a $ 6b ( assumably cad ) deal for 65 gripen-es and maintenance , which means that they could offer the planes for $ 70m ( usd ) each , including 40 years of maintenance . 
  according to reports to the french parliament , rafale c costs ( excluding development costs ) roughly $ 70m . 
  the eurofighter is going to cost $ 90m though , and the feasibility of continued production might not be too good , so at some point parts are going to be expensive . 
  that said , the gripen is a light fighter , so the competition is a bunch of heavier planes . 
  for comparison , the gripen 's empty weight is 8 tons and maximum take-off weight 16 tons . 
  rafale 's comparable numbers are about 10 and 24.5 tons , eurofighter 's 11 and 23.5 , and f35a 's 13 and 32 tons . 
  not sure how strong they are these days . 
  a finnish dairy co-operative used to have a [ near monopoly ] ( http://www.dairyreporter.com/manufacturers/fresh-milk-antitrust-fine-costly-decision-for-consumers-and-valio ) , but swedish arla and lots of smaller dairies are gaining ground . 
  in the 60s there was massive butter overproduction and a ( partially legitimate ) smear campaign against margarine producers , often considered getting a start from an article titled `` do we eat refined filth - does a foreign margarine trust play with finns ' health ? '', 
  i understand that it 's a way smaller single-engine multirole plane . 
  rafale 's multirole , too . 
  eurofighter is by design an interceptor which can also do some other roles . 
  the gripen-e is supposed to be very cheap to fly . 
  rafale flight hours are apparently quite expensive in comparison . 
  finnish , norwegian and swedish air forces do quite commonly train together . 
  i guess they could all speak swedish , but usually they go with english . 
  i 'd guess at least the instructors for the norwegians with their f-16s and finns with their f-18s are probably trained in the u.s. and of course , this is an ad as well , so there 's no need to dub or subtitle it separately to various languages if it 's in english . 
  in finland , even the more highly-processed ( most commonly , lactose-free ) milk is labeled `` milk drink '' . 
  `` oat milk '' and the like are `` oat drink '' etc. 
  in the comment replied to , i was not quite sure which terms to use . 
  as others have pointed out , despite ncp being of conservative origins , they are n't exactly what people might think as capital-c conservatives , either . 
  the homma guys do n't really match `` alt-right '' either , but i 'd still say that they 're separate from our proper far right nutjobs and traditional ncp-brand right-wing politics , and as such , the descriptor is n't entirely wrong , either . 
  note to non-finns : traditionally , agrarians/centrists , liberals ( parties of the '' [ young finnish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_finnish_party ) '' tradition ) and conservatives ( heirs to the `` old finnish '' ) are grouped as `` bourgeois parties '' in finland instead of `` right-wing '' . 
  and yes , it 's `` finnish '' not `` finns '' there - as the really old party grouping in finland was swedish-speakers vs. finnish-speakers . 
  dr halla-aho keeps a blog . 
  when the guestbook part became unmanageable , it was spun off as hommaforum ( `` the thing forum '' ) discussion board , which i believe is quite large these days , with similarities though , such as their own slang . 
  ( such as ironically calling themselves `` netzis '' , referring to openly fascist or racist movements `` extreme homma '' etc. ), 
  a lot of those memes - including calling dr halla-aho `` the master '' ( which i believe he does not fancy ) come from a funny little 1994 documentary called sieg heil finland . 
  yes , including calling their thing `` homma '' and the upward trend in the logo . 
  e : fixing a few typos . 
  i kind of agree with / u/hardly _ lolling - the ministers are n't there exactly to decide all the details , but to provide political oversight . 
  so the career officials are going to go thru the available options and the minister and other elected people are going to decide which one they are going to pick . 
  it is n't strictly necessary to be an expert on the field , though it may help . 
  i suggested '' [ finns party ( unity ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_finland_%281994%29 ) '' , but i guess '' [ new alternative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_finland_%281994%29#deva_.e2.80.93_skpy.27s_electoral_front ) '' is ok , as well . 
  during the 90s recession , our centrist prime minister was esko aho . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hybrid_air_vehicles_hav_304_airlander_10#overview ) ,  the airlander 10 is capable of staying aloft for five days while crewed , and over two weeks while unmanned . 
  the type had the potential for various civil and military applications ; these include transportation purposes , conducting aerial surveillance , acting as a communications relay , supporting disaster relief operations , and various passenger services such as leisure flights and luxury vip duties . 
  many of these duties could involve different configurations of the airship 's mission module to suit . 
  northrop also said the lemv could be used as a cargo aircraft , claiming that it had enough buoyancy to haul seven tons of cargo 3,900 km ( 2,400 mi ) at 50 km/h ( 30 mph ) . 
  according to hav , the design would allow operators to choose between trade-offs between endurance and cargo capacity , carrying up to a maximum of 30,000 lb of cargo . 
  it 's been ages since airships were also suggested as a way to provide cargo services , including relief , into areas of no paved runways or ports . 
  i 'm pretty sure mps are voted for in the parliamentary election , not in the party 's internal elections . 
  a lot of the northern and eastern mps went wholesale to the new group . 
  you know , from the finnish countryside . 
  if not for soini and terho , you could almost typecast the new group as `` finnish rural party '' . 
  we 'll see that pretty quick , with city council meetings . 
  the minister of defense is also a docent ( academic title , occasionally translated as `` adjunct professor '' ) in military history , making him probably amongst the most qualified people for the job . 
  [ yle ] ( https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9666763 ) has a group pic and mentions that speaker maria lohela is also part of the group . 
  the new choice will be chaired by simon elo and vice-chaired by tiina elovaara . 
  e : and since the first list , veera ruoho has also announced joining the new group . 
  another mp is leaving , not clear what group , and the chairman of the finns parliamentary group might leave , as well . 
  if that happens , the finns will have less seats than the greens . 
  background : the government coalition between centre ( nordic centre/agrarian ) , national coalition ( conservative ) and finns ( populist mix ) fell apart when the right wing of the finns party won the party internal elections last weekend . 
  the finns party had essentially two major groupings : the old `` anti-fat cat '' style populist wing and the newer `` alt-right '' wing . 
  essentially the entire old guard ( and a few of moderates the immigration critic wing ) left the party group in the parliament . 
  the only way to leave the euro zone is to leave the eu , though . 
  there 's a few issues involved , including * dr. halla-aho 's status as an mep , along with his rather combative relationship with the media * the first vice chair , who 'd then run the party in finland , is a relatively fresh as a politician ( first elected as a city councillor in 2012 , mp since 2015 ) and has stated somewhat controversial opinions * the second vice chair ... imagine if mr trump was from bumfuck , nowhere instead of new york and you get the drift . 
  * the third vice chair has had some contact with neo-nazis . 
  such as hiring a card-carrying member of a neofascist movement as his parliamentary assistant .
