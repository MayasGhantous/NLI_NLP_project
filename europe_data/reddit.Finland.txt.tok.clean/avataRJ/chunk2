  the russians are at least as well equipped as the ukranians , and probably better armed . 
  ( though i ca n't scold the ukranians for not giving heavy weapons to the volunteers . ), 
  norway is a member of nato . 
  ( and yes , i am well aware that these observation flights are pre-planned well in advance . ), 
  funnily enough , i think finnish and norwegian air forces did a monitoring flight a few weeks ago . 
  ( e : [ yup .

  if someone needs a bigger version of that image , the finnish version of the news blurb provides a [ print quality ] ( http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/wcm/efa8b9004544083d9491bc609a8fa5d4/20140828_31__122.jpg?mod=ajperes ) one . 
  yes , mixed up with my native-language summary of article four ( which has `` in the opinion of any of them '' translated roughly as `` any of them may request '' ) . 
  i did indeed misremember article five . 
  article four has the `` in the opinion of any of them '' . 
  the funny part is that local politicians talk about `` possible natural disasters '' etc. 
  though still , ~ ~ ( just like with the nato 5th article ) ~ ~ , the host country will need to request assitance , and my understanding is that nato countries are in no way obligated to help . 
  [ i think this is the relevant document . 
  ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.everyspec.com%2fnato%2fnato-atp%2fdownload.php%3fspec%3dajp-4x5a_may2005.016612.pdf ) e : [ here 's a newer copy of that document on norwegian defense forces ' site ] ( http://hogskolene.forsvaret.no/english/documents/ajp-4.5%20hns%20-%20may%202013%20edb%20v1%20e.pdf ) . 
  the beef is on page 13 or so . 
  e2 : today is not a good day to spell for me , apparently . 
  e3 : yes , i did misremember article 5 . 
  iirc , nato members also need to ask for help ( * no , i did n't recall correctly * ) , so this is kind of parallel to this . 
  however , the important distinction is that unlike with its members , nato troops are not required to assist `` host nations '' . 
  ( e : spelling + correction ), 
  i understand that even back when we had an [ agreement of friendship , co-operation and mutual assistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yya ) with a country called `` soviet union '' , our military had dealings with the west . 
  the air force is more or less certified to host nato planes , etc. 
  - possibly to a slightly higher degree than some of the eastern nato members . 
  ( fiaf flies f-18s , for what that 's worth . ), 
  i understand that the air force regularly exercises with the swedes and the norwegians . 
  and then there 's individual events like some marines that came to train in finland , nordic battlegroup , etc. 
  so the political process is the key - i 'm not quite sure how fast that 'd be , but i 'd assume that nato is n't a mickey mouse club . 
  several foreign leaders stated that they 'd welcome finland to nato , but i would n't take that as a promise of `` sure , send the papers in triplicate , we 'll stamp 'em and you 're in '' . 
  e : case in point . 
  there 's apparently a military exercise called `` northern coasts 14 '' going on . 
  one of the afternoon papers had `` german military on the march to turku '' ( free translation ) as one of the news . 
  the finnish usage of `` nato option '' is perhaps best described by our current prime minister , who ( in his typical style ) detailed three possible solutions to the nato question : we join , or we do n't join , or then we have the nato option . 
  essentially , `` nato option '' is political rhetoric for `` i do n't want to say what i think about nato , because it might scare some of my voters away '' . 
  the supporters of nato use it as `` let 's not scare voters , when the time comes when my seat in the parliament is in no jeopardy we 'll join '' and the opponents use it as `` we do n't need to join , they might accept us later '' . 
  well , iltalehti was originally the evening version of [ uusi suomi ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/uusi_suomi#mediaviewer/tiedosto:uuden_suomen_viimeinen_numero.jpg ) , though uusi suomi was originally supporting national coalition ( conservatives ) , not patriotic people 's movement ( fascists ) . 
  the new uusi suomi online news site does report that according to moscow times , the price of food is up in the russian far east , with allegedly suggestions about restarting the traditional reindeer farming . 
  the article is mentioned as amongst the most read on the mt site , but the link to it does n't seem to lead anywhere . 
  the highest point of finland is n't at the border , but it 's still a spur of the fell . 
  the actual summit ( 41 meters higher ) is on the norwegian side of the border . 
  as a slightly related matter , finnish authorities have decided to allow an exception for ( already packaged ) refrigerated goods intended for the russian market to be sold in finland with product information in russian , provided that there 's the same information available near by in finnish and swedish , as well . 
  apparently , the business in shops near the eastern border is good . 
  do n't think people from st. petersburg would come to finland to shop ? 
  well , let 's say that russia stopped importing potatoes in july . 
  my mother mentioned me , amazed , that she 'd slightly afterwards seen a family buying several carts full of potatoes at a local supermarket . 
  ( my old folks live close to the border along european route e18 . ), 
  but are they [ pompous enough ] ( http://satwcomic.com/coat-of-arms ) ? 
  and the followup , in case someone happens to read this : the components were air-to-air missile seeker heads . 
  they were sent from vietnam to be serviced in ukraine . 
  finland requires a permit for transporting weapons through its territory , and therefor ( as far as i am aware ) it remains interdicted until the paperwork is in order . 
  another similar event happened in december 2011 , when m/s thor liberty got into distress in the gulf of finland en route to kotka , finland . 
  the pilot dutifully reported the port authorities that he had noticed some of the cargo loose . 
  once harboured safely , the harbor authorities noticed that the loose cargo was industrial explosives , at which point the harbour was cordoned off and a full cargo check was initiated . 
  there were some crates from germany listed as `` raketen '' , which were opened and 69 patriot missiles were discovered . 
  some eyebrows were raised , because the final destination of the ship was in china , though eventually it was found out that the missiles were being sold by germany to south korea . 
  after the explosives were properly loaded into containers , the paperwork was done , the ship left with the missiles . 
  afaik moscow has since signalled that russia will not receive any flight recorders . 
  ( there are total of 12 in the plane . ), 
  there were union plans at one point before the ww ii . 
  nowadays it would be entirely impossible . 
  i mean , where would we go to get our cheap booze ? 
  the 2005 map pointed out by the op in comments is a bit different ( more homicides in the south ) , but otherwise , not very strange . 
  poorer and less populated areas in the east and north , and high population density in uusimaa ( county surrounding helsinki ) . 
  well , news about shootings are actually somewhat regular , but the dark version is that apparently , we 've gotten worse at aiming . 
  as the old saying is that you behave in the sauna as you 'd behave in a church . 
  so , um , no . 
  the `` traditional '' finnish homicide is that a group of people bottle up in some hovel to drink , and then they get into an argument , and someone decides to solve it with a knife . 
  ( traditional shooting used to be the same , but instead of a knife with a hunting rifle that was stored on the antlers hanging on the wall - gun control laws have more or less eliminated that , though . ), 
  can you still get the civilian professional permit to handle explosives if you get demolitions/raivaaja training ? 
  there 's a legend of guys on * sissi * ( light infantry , recon/ranger kind of guys ) training given an area of operations where they were supposed to practice survival skills . 
  in a version of the story , this area includes someone 's ( family ) summer home , promptly turning the exercise into a week-long fishing & sauna trip . 
  ( `` oh , you ate combat rations ? 
  we caught some fish and made smoked salmon . '' ), 
  still a touchy subject in finland . 
  in general , the military was trying to reform even the decade ago , but the old `` prussian '' habits do not die fast , including bullying ( despite the hard stance officially against it ) . 
  one way the service can be useful is that for units needing lots of drivers , if you had a driver 's license , you could receive some extra training from the army , and provided you had the required quota of practice and then completed the red tape , you could upgrade your civilian license , i.e. 
  from b/passenger car license to bc/passenger cars and trucks , or from bc to bece/with heavy trailers . 
  ( but not from b to bece . ), 
  the typical propaganda also mentions learning life skills ( well , technically everyone gets some first aid training ) , improving physical fitness ( this is mostly true ) and for some cases , being the first time some people are separated from their mothers . 
  ( there are legends of people who were taught in the army how to tie their shoelaces . 
  while the common uniform is fatigues , for special occasions the proper uniform can be requested . 
  to wear the uniform properly , you need to use a tie . 
  apparently tying a tie is harder than it looks . ), 
  and then the fact that everyone gets dumped in the same place , some of them selected for leadership ( leadership types , more skilled , and then the quota gets filled by some insane troll logic ) and this results in a very interesting psychological experiment . 
  of course , the other opinion is that it wastes a year from young men 's life that 'd be better spent studying . 
  or the fact that in order to keep the trained reserve in a fighting condition , they 'd need to be regularly called back . 
  ( i 've had ... um , two days of refresher training during the last decade . 
  at this point , my memory of how to operate the squad radio approaches the level of the retiring first sergeant we had during basic training : ( 1 ) do n't hit it with a hammer , ( 2 ) do n't throw it in a lake . ), 
  the actual experience on the service varies wildly depending on various factors , including the unit , instructors and conscript leaders . 
  there 's always a few conscript ncos who let the chevrons to get to their heads . 
  the old staff ncos also used a very strong `` drill sergeant '' stereotype . 
  and then there 's people who 've been introduced to each other in the army and stay as friends . 
  due to timing , there 's this one sports event and a military exercise arranged the same time . 
  used to meet my old instructor ( good guy ) at the gas station when coming back with a team . 
  ( by chance , but several years in a row . ), 
  especially if you were selected to the reserve officer school ( which trains all the conscripts who are to become platoon leaders , one place for the entire country ) and considered to be skilled/good guy there , you could get valuable contacts . 
  however , the value of having that `` 2nd ltn ( res ) '' line in your cv has degraded a lot , unless you apply to a very conservative company . 
  there 's recently been much discussion on a visa-free treaty between russia and finland , but this far , no . 
  not sure if there are exceptions , such as finns being able to visit russia ( i.e. 
  vyborg and st. peterburg ) , but only when it 's a tour as a part of a cruise .
