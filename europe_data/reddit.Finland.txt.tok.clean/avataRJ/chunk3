  the imperative part being that the border crossing must be done on a ship . 
  i do n't know about how russia handles the customs , but a lot of local shops are tax free . 
  i understand it 's handled so that they get all the recipes , they 're checked at the border and the vat is reimbused , so at least on the finnish side there is an incentive to go thru customs . 
  the border is heavily forested - especially on the russian side , to the point where the border is very obvious on aerial photographs ( the soviets used to keep it uncut as an extra barrier , the finnish side has farms and stuff from the times the border was n't there ) - so i would n't expect uncontrolled routes . 
  the [ border line ] ( http://www.raja.fi/functions/border_surveillance ) itself is cut and patrolled ( on top of any electronic surveillance ) . 
  the rich people are probably still rich . 
  the almost-rich probably need to re-think their spending . 
  the demographic this would hit the worst would be the people who 'd buy a ticket on a charter bus which would drive directly to the parking lot of a large supermarket or a mall , and then people would do their shopping , and then the bus would drive back . 
  another demographic hit ( probably partially converting to the previously-mentioned ) would be the emerging middle class , which would pack the family to the compact car ( e.g. 
  a nissan micra ) and drive to finland for a vacation . 
  these two are probably responsible why there 's so many large supermarkets in southeastern finland . 
  in finland , one of the companies probably suffering is actually a former part of nokia ( that is , the company formerly known as finnish rubber works ) : nokian tyres . 
  russia used to be a major market for them - and funnily enough , while nokian has a factory in russia , the russian customers were quite strict that the products they 'd get had the `` made in finland '' stamp , believing that those were of higher quality . 
  i understand that the tire factory has recently invested heavily on the central european market . 
  edit : here 's a [ report ] ( http://www.sitra.fi/julkaisut/raportti66.pdf ) from the beginning of the boom . 
  electrical and optical devices and machinery and vehicles being major categories . 
  yeah , i remember the times when you could see a column of car transports trucks head to the border . 
  along with other trucks , at the best/worst the queue at one point was roughly 100 km long . 
  ( admitted , the police broke it up and assigned parking lots to the trucks to keep regular traffic still going . ), 
  assumably a lot of the re-exports are going directly to russia , though : they 've built a few new ports . 
  why would they buy american phones ? 
  in any case , this has a lot to do with the value of the ruble dropping a lot . 
  so suddenly , finnish goods ( along with many other goods from abroad ) are a lot more expensive to russians . 
  another indicator is that while many russians had bought datshas ( vacation homes ) abroad as a status symbol - many of these in finland , being conveniently close to st. petersburg - the market for these has recently crashed and many are for sale as people are trying to get money for more pressing needs . 
  do n't have yet an english language source for this , but as stubb replaces [ jyrki katainen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jyrki_katainen ) as prime minister of finland , mr. katainen will replace [ olli rehn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olli_rehn ) as a [ commissar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commissioner_for_economic_and_monetary_affairs_and_the_euro ) for the remaining days , with an aim to be the finnish commissar for the next term . 
  mr. rehn will become a mep . 
  stubb was also elected as a mep , but his seat will go to [ petri sarvamaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petri_sarvamaa ) . 
  time to invest on the xylitol factory we have around here . 
  according to helsingin sanomat ( largest newpaper in finland ) one of the student chapters of the national coalition party has indeed left an initiative to the national coalition party meeting ( held tomorrow ) that the party should try to make finland a monarchy . 
  ( the funny thing is , the national coalition * was * originally founded as a monarchist party . ), 
  the suggestion has nearly zero chance of passing even in the party meeting , though . 
  oops . 
  not sure . 
  okay , that was n't that easy to find information about that after all . 
  edit : [ this page ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/after-election-success-far-right-parties-line-eu-money-parliament-302610 ) seems to suggest that the rules are the same . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00264f77f5/grants-to-political-parties-and-foundations.html ) took a while to find . 
   since july 2004 , european political parties have been able to receive annual funding from the european parliament . 
  the funding takes the form of an operating grant . 
  it can cover up to 85 % of the eligible expenditure of a party , while the rest should be covered by own resources such as membership fees and donations . 
  [ ... ]  the grant can be used to meet the expenditure directly linked to the objectives set out in the party 's political programme , such as meetings and conferences , publications , studies and advertisements , administrative , personnel and travel costs , campaign costs connected to european elections . 
  ( mild edit , original latter quote was a bullet-point list . ), 
  i understand that the parliamentary groups do get a budget and easier access to committee representation . 
  i understand the seven state requirement was introduced specifically to block the far right groups from accessing taxpayer money . 
  without group they 'll become [ non-inscrits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-inscrits ) ( non-attached members ) . 
  from the wiki , `` being part of a group grants access to state funds and committee seats '' . 
  for the follow-up question : in 1918 , [ finland was declared a kingdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_finland_%281918%29 ) . 
  this was justified as needing `` stable leadership '' and things like that after the civil war . 
  the issue is that there was no royal family , so the monarchists started digging the law books . 
  since the legislation had been quite stagnant , they found the swedish instrument of government of 1772 . 
  since finland had originally inherited swedish laws , and the law had n't been repealed , technically it was still valid ( despite the fact than finland had been declared a republic in the declaration of independence ) . 
  so they went on to elect a king . 
  now , this is the very end of the ww i. 
  the germans had helped finnish whites to beat the reds , so to maintain strong ties a german prince was elected , friedrich karl of hesse . 
  ( originally they 'd wanted a junior son of the kaiser , but this was not okay to the germans . ), 
  the election was concluded on 9th of october . 
  der kaiser abdicated on 9th of november , and on 14th of december our king-elect renounced the throne . 
  republicans won the next election . 
  some finnish papers like to keep track fo the pretender , though . 
  in order to change the constitution , either two successive parliaments must accept the change by a 2/3 majority , or the parliament must consider it urgent by 5/6 majority and then confirm any changes by 2/3 majority . 
  any exceptions to the constitution can be also accepted similarly , most notably what is considered the dark spot of finnish democracy - the extension of president urho kekkonen 's third term by four years . 
  the powers of the president have been very much given to the parliament and/or council of state ( government ) or removed altogether after the reign of urho i ( 25 years as the president - after that , a limit of 2x6 years was introduced ) . 
  originally the office of the president carried many of the powers that would have belonged to the monarch , and occasionally it was joked that finland was the `` only nordic monarchy '' ( the other nordics being monarchies with ceremonial heads-of-state , and finland being a republic with a strong president ) . 
  that 'd certainly be the first occasion where a person had been a president and first lady/gentleman . 
  but just think of the chances , with the bushes you 'd have a chance of electing a third-generation president !, 
  actually , d'hondt works perfectly fine if you vote for a party , which has a predetermined list of candidates . 
  ( i think they vote this way in sweden . ), 
  i understand `` long lists '' are used in sweden , as well . 
  on the finnish system : the adverts display the candidate 's number , on the voting station there will be lists posted on walls listing all candidates , and in the voting booth there will be the same list . 
  the ballot paper is provided to the voter when the voter identifies himself . 
  the number is drawn in the booth , ballot folded . 
  an official stamps the ballot and then the voter places it in the box . 
  if the voting is done in advance , mostly the same thing happens , except the voter places the vote in an envelope , which gets collected and counted later . 
  as a thing , there is no candidate number 1 to prevent bias . 
  before the real election there was an election held for some schoolkids , and independence party ( fringe single-issue `` secede from the eu '' party with a side dish of returning to markka and direct democracy , i think ) won by a landslide by the virtue of having candidate # 69 . 
  at 99.9 percent , the results are now essentially final . 
  the largest local party is national coalition ( kok - epp ) , lead in the polls by our current minister of european affairs and foreign trade [ alexander stubb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_stubb ) . 
  their other selected candidates are [ sirpa pietik\u00e4inen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sirpa_pietik%c3%a4inen ) ( current mep ) and [ henna virkkunen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henna_virkkunen ) ( minister of communal and administrative affairs ) . 
  ( if dr. stubb gets elected as the chairman of his party , it can be expected that he will be replaced in the europarl with [ petri sarvamaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petri_sarvamaa ) , a current mep . ), 
  the second party with three seats is centre ( kesk - alde ) , a nordic agrarian party . 
  their leading candidate is [ olli rehn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olli_rehn ) , european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs and the euro , tightly followed by [ paavo v\u00e4yrynen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paavo_v%c3%a4yrynen ) , a eurosceptic . 
  the third is [ anneli j\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anneli_j%c3%a4%c3%a4tteenm%c3%a4ki ) , a current mep and ex-prime minister of finland . 
  ( dr. v\u00e4yrynen may eye return to the national parliament or ministerial position should centre win the next national election . 
  he would then be replaced by [ hannu takkula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hannu_takkula ) , a current mep . ), 
  third comes the finns party with two eurosceptic and immigration critical candidates , [ jussi halla-aho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jussi_halla-aho ) ( originally profiled in the 2011 national election as the candidate of hommaforum , an immigration critical discussion forum ) and [ sampo terho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sampo_terho ) , their current sole mep and the chairman of the association of finnish culture . 
  the fourth is social democrats with two candidates , [ liisa jaakonsaari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liisa_jaakonsaari ) ( a current mep and a member of the right-leaning wing of her party ) and miapetra kumpula-natri ( chairwoman of the grand commitee of the finnish parliament , i.e. 
  kind of `` upper house lite '' , also in charge of eu affairs in the parliament ) . 
  fifth comes leftist alliance , returning to the europarl with merja kyll\u00f6nen , the recently resigned minister of transport . 
  sixth , greens ( losing one seat ) with [ heidi hautala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heidi_hautala ) , profiled on environmental protection and human rights . 
  she resigned from the position of minister of international development and ownership over a scandal related to whether or not state-owned arctia shipping should sue demonstrators who had came onboard an icebreaker . 
  seventh , swedish people 's party with current mep [ nils torvalds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nils_torvalds ) ( yes , he 's linus 's dad ) , part of the left-leaning wing of his party . 
  he will join the centre party candidates in alde . 
  notably , christian democrats lost their sole seat , with [ sari essayah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sari_essayah ) ( a current mep ) being the most-voted candidate not selected to the european parliament . 
  the most voted candidates were dr. alexander stubb ( almost 150.000 votes right now ) , dr. jussi halla-aho ( over 80.000 votes ) and mr. olli rehn ( over 70.000 votes ) . 
  first projection : * kok 3 * kesk 3 * ps 2 * sdp 2 * vas 1 * vihr 1 * rkp 1 looking at european parties : * alde 4 ( kesk & rkp ) * epp 3 ( kok ) * s&d 2 ( sdp ) * efd ? 
  2 ( ps ) * gue/ngl 1 ( vas ) * greens/efa 1 ( vihr ) edit : and apparently , [ the forecast ] ( http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2014/eurovaalit/ehdokkaat_vertauslukujarjestyksessa.html ) is n't shown on the english page ( link to finnish page ) . 
  edit 2 : actually messed up . 
  finnish greens are in greens/efa . 
  these results will be compiled by yle ( finnish public broadcasting company ) , it is expected that a mathematical model will be applied to correct skew in first-counted districts ( smaller towns and countryside ) at roughly 21:10 local time . 
  edit : oh , party affiliations for the projected `` four large '' : * kok ( and kd ) = epp * kesk ( and rkp ) = alde * sdp = s&d * ps = ... actually not sure ( eurosceptics ) kok and kesk 3 - 4 seats , sdp and ps 1 - 2 seats , other contenders for a single seat are leftist alliance , greens , swedish people 's party ( rkp ) and christian democrats ( kd ) .
