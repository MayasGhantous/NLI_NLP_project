  very distantly related : a wolverine was spotted in my home town ( on someone 's backyard ) , probably some 100 km or so from previously assumed range . 
  ( [ news about the spotting in finnish . 
  marseille , some greek islands , probably the nile delta and the turkish half of cyprus would be quite affected . 
  a lot of southern italy , too . 
  though yes , turkey could also do the project , probably at the dardanelles ( west of the sea of marmara ) to save istanbul . 
  on another map , that would n't be quite just enough yet to fill the aral basin with water from the sea . 
  unless turkmenistan or kazakhstan would help a bit by building a canal . 
  and even then , i guess that the russians might be interested on consulting the dutch on how to build a dyke at rostov-on-don . 
  ( russians already have a big dam project protecting st. petersburg from being claimed by the baltic sea - wind direction does affect water level in the gulf of finland quite a bit , so with strong westwind the people at st. peters would get their feet wet . ), 
  the gibraltar dam would solve a good amount of the issues for the mediterranean countries . 
  on the other hand , the black sea breaking thru the caucasus into the caspian sea would be a sight to see . 
  i studied german for two years in school . 
  we were specifically reminded that if we needed to see the manager anywhere , the correct word to use for that kind of leader is not * der f\u00fchrer * . 
  [ commando ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commando_%28comics%29 ) , published as `` korkeaj\u00e4nnitys '' ( j\u00e4nnitys = excitement/triller , wordplay on `` korkeaj\u00e4nnite '' = high voltage ) is/was a source of learning german for many young finns . 
  admittedly , the vocabulary tends to be somewhat limited . 
  ( yeah , yeah , finnish school system was originally copied from the germans , and it used to be quite common language to study at school , too . 
  nothing compared to english or swedish , though . 
  also , there were some special issues of * korkeaj\u00e4nnitys * which were specifically made for finland and not translations of commando . ), 
  the competitiveness-increasing plan has a name : [ horizon 2020 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizon_2020 ) . 
  in short , decreased material consumption , increased material recycling and reuse , decreased energy consumption and higher manufacturing efficiency . 
  on some fields there already is a shortage of skilled labour , and things like cutting unemployment benefits and essentially forcing people to take any job increases the pool of unskilled labour , but europe probably ca n't compete with low-wage countries on availability of unskilled or low-skilled labour , so the option left is to increase efficiency and refining rate . 
  pan-european slashing of benefits does , however , have a term , and it is called inflation . 
  all in the hands of the european central bank . 
  a little bit probably would n't hurt to help exports out of the eurozone get going . 
  well , the last election was in 2011 , the term of the parliament is four years . 
  however , there is a small chance ( sdp and nc not finding consensus ) that the coalition 's going to fall , which would trigger an early election . 
  the parties are probably wanting to see the europarl elections first to gauge relative strength ( before planning further : changes would happen over the summer ) . 
  the current top three parties on gallups are the nc ( pro-euro/eu , at least the top politicians ) , center ( agrarian , a mix of policies from olli rehn who is very pro-euro to eurosceptics ) and finns ( populist , eurosceptic , ca n't - we-return-to-80s party ) . 
  most of the other parties ( that matter ) support the euro and eu . 
  the finns party line may be changing to a more moderate direction , possibly in a bid to get into the cabinet . 
  ( my personal opinion is that they intentionally torpedoed their chances to get into the cabinet in 2011 by presenting a list of demands no other major party would accept , so that they can balloon their support in the opposition . ), 
  in practice , if the finns do n't get the top position , the old `` big three '' can probably find a consensus and form a coalition after the next election , very little to change . 
  if the finns party gets to be the biggest , then by custom they get to name the prime minister and the negotiations to form a coalition can be pretty tough . 
  by custom , the president is above party politics ( symbolically resigning from the party after being elected ) , but in a pinch , it is meaningful that national coalition currently holds the office . 
  not sure what the current situation is , but last september ranked # 3 in the world for economic competitiveness . 
  ( though i do personally think that the competitiveness rankings are probably useless , tailor it to work in one environment and does n't work at others . ), 
  now , part of why the finnish public finances look so good is that there are large pension funds that are , i understand , counted as public funds even if it is not allowed to use those for purposes other than pensions . 
  politically , pm katainen surprised many by announcing that he 'll resign and a bunch of ministers are looking towards the european parliament . 
  after a tight vote , the social democrats did vote in a union hawk as chairman instead of our current deputy pm / treasurer . 
  he 's pretty new in the world of politics , so hopefully having the party hq help a bit behind his back . 
  however , sdp will probably be looking to capitalize on the changes in the cabinet and try to push their own agenda . 
  they used to be competing of the top position in politics , but currently the populists have passed them - and being a `` caretaker party '' means that the worker part of the traditional support base is leaking towards the populists . 
  i understand the new chairman 's policy on spending is not only increasing the role of the public sector but also increasing stimulation to the economy . 
  it 'll be interesting what the national coalition ( corporate lapdog / wannabe rich people party currently leading the cabinet ) has to say about that . 
  of the small finnic languages , [ ingrian/izhorian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingrian_language ) will die and there 's probably nothing we can do about it . 
  [ karelian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelian_language ) might survive if it sees the revival , but the odds are n't necessarily that good . 
  the last [ livonian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_language ) speaker died in 2013 . 
  [ veps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veps_language ) is still taught to children , but not very many . 
  [ votic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/votic_language ) will die , with less than hundred native speakers left . 
  / u/kookosbanaani already mentioned s\u00e1mi languages . 
  or the other uralic languages , [ mari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_language ) will probably survive for a while longer . 
  similarly for the [ permic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/permic_languages ) languages , udmurt ( half a million speakers ) and komi ( a few hundred thousand speakers ) . 
  the related [ samoyedic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samoyedic_languages ) languages spoken in siberia ( so technically not in europe ) are not in a good shape , either . 
  [ actually , it may not be quite that simple . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberian_natural_resources ) though yes , those parts - at least as far as i 've heard the news - have been very stable for quite a few years now . 
  did n't some areas in siberia wish for a higher degree of autonomy , or is it just loud individuals ? 
  the picture on the article is n't by chance . ), 
  i understand that some parts of fenno-swedish used to be essentially swedish locked into 19th century . 
  now , i ca n't speak that ( i 'm from the east part of the country , not many swedish-speakers here ) but i understand the dialect of [ n\u00e4rpes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzz5d26u0yu ) is quite unintelligible . 
  the finnish equivalent would be the old [ rauma dialect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rauma_dialect ) , though speakers of old kymi dialect ( close from where i am from ) could qualify on some phrases . 
  my paternal grandmother spoke a southeastern dialect from the karelian isthmus - though inland karelian dialects would be more distant from `` standard finnish '' . 
  this . 
  i was visiting spain for a work trip , a colleague simply did not agree to get coffee from any place else than starbucks . 
  ( the twist is , he insisted on calling it `` robert 's '' after [ a chain we have in finland ] ( http://www.robertscoffee.com/en/roberts-coffee/ ) . ), 
  what about those rubber ball like potatoes ? 
  in case you are not familiar , peeled potatoes cooked in a central kitchen and then taken heated to various nearby cantinas ( schools , hospitals , etc. ), 
  to be served . 
  not counting their heavier weight , probably could be used to play ping pong . 
  i hope i just did n't trigger the weaponization of finnish cuisine . 
  the finns ( or true finns ) party is also considered to be socially conservative , even if they do not economically conservative . 
  the direct predecessor of the party is finnish rural party , which counted unemployed and small farmers among its supporters . 
  the mainstream finns party line is much more urban , supported by workers disillusioned of the social democrats and other leftists , being the `` most leftist non-socialist party '' . 
  the vocal party minority is the right-wing `` immigration critical '' faction ( which at least i understand as a politically correct euphemism for `` racists '' ) and old school nationalists ( people disillusioned with the national coalition party ) . 
  of course , the true finnish ( pun intended ) radical right-wing faction is national coalition 's youth organization , which seems to have a nice habit of electing our local equivalents of neocons as youth league chairmen . 
  they are not a party though , and their parent party is much more conservative . 
  most recently , there was a minor scandal in the youth league when the press noticed that they had `` decriminalization of agitation against ethnic group '' in their program . 
  i think one of the chairmen within the last decade was privately a royalist , too . 
  finnish does also have a dictionary , but it 's about the standard variant of the language which is perceived as very official-sounding to many . 
  unless in a very formal situation , we speak in regional dialects , and thus do n't necessarily care about the official words . 
  especially for computing vocabulary , where the committees making up new words have n't really kept in pace . 
  some people do , however , understand old official terms which have n't stuck - occasionally you hear people saying `` n\u00e4k\u00f6radio '' ( visual radio ) for tv etc. 
  wait , that 's ... err , faroe islands ? 
  iirc , the f-16s were patrolling the baltic airspace ( they do n't have their own air wings , but get patrolled by nato allies ) , and as the bomber probably came from kaliningrad , it 's more or less routine to do an identification mission when you get strategic bombers that close . 
  ( it was n't exactly that long ago , before finland had relatively modern jets , that the finnish air force did n't bother keeping even radars manned outside of office hours . ), 
  not really racist ( finland is very ethnically homogenous ) . 
  but things like [ his statement about countries occupied in wwii ] ( http://whatsupfinland.org/english/hagglunds-remarks-cause-controversy-in-finland/ ) come into mind . 
  somehow i got reminded by an old school language learning tape about some potential problems finns might have pronouncing english . 
  it has the finn proudly declaring that `` yes , we have very good doctors ! '', 
  ( he 's earlier , with roughly equal pride , pointed out his boss 's family and told that `` he 's a very impotent man !, 
  '' , prompting the guest to ask about whose children are those and wonder about finnish doctors . ), 
  for the most part , this change happened by looking up anything in the inventory that had the descriptor `` anti-personnel mine '' and replace the word `` mine '' with the word `` charge '' . 
  the practical change is replacing a pressure-based detonator with a remote detonator . 
  and since after this change there were no longer any anti-personnel mines , this gap needed to be closed somehow , so the fdf bought some new types of ap charges & munitions . 
  ca n't remember if they got the fascam they wanted , because placing mines by hand is totally evil , but somehow shooting that stuff with rocket launchers was apparently a-ok . ( edit : fascam , no . 
  cluster ammunition , yes . ), 
  also , even according to the treaty banning antipersonnel mines , it 's still perfectly okay to booby-trap anti-tank mines . 
  i would n't be exactly surprised if the fdf had a few extra `` traps '' . 
  because finland has still at least technically the capability to wage old-school total war . 
  also , some things are still in the cold war era `` crazy prepared '' mode - late last year there was some discussion about if air raid / atomic shelters should be still required in newly built large buildings . 
  ( there two large shelters just around the corner from my office , they 're used as recreational rooms right now . ),
