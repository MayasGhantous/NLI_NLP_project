  any laws which include the word `` realm '' are less than funny . 
  ( the state of defense law does however mention that anyone 's basic human rights `` should not be violated more than necessary '' . 
  president gets the call to declare state of defense , the parliament has a veto . ), 
  noteworthy that [ general h\u00e4gglund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustav_h%c3%a4gglund ) is a second-generation general officer . 
  ( his father was a general in wwii . ), 
  more or less early picked to the fast track . 
  large reforms of the military during his time as the chief of defense made him a kind of a minor celebrity . 
  has a history of less than diplomatic statements . 
  ( imagine an ultrademocratic , low-budget version of prince philip . 
  of course , being retired , he does n't get as much attention than the royals do in britain . ), 
  seriously ? 
  nowadays , most militaries are no longer issued ridiculously pompous ceremonial uniforms . 
  so , camo is all they 've got for uniform . 
  the function of the high visibility vest is to allow other people using the road to see them well . 
  these days , it is not very fashionable to have casualties during peacetime exercise maneuvers . 
  well , the communist party pravda apparently has a circulation of 100k or so still . 
  and then there 's komsomolskaya pravda ( former youth version ) that transformed itself into a tabloid and has a circulation of 660k . 
  probably would need to rip open a lot more than piping to get every place with moisture to dry . 
  more or less only if you have mountains and dammed rivers . 
  when you have a surplus of solar or wind , either reduce hydro power production or even pump upstream . 
  then use hydro power to compensate . 
  i understand the norwegians already do this : when the danes have surplus wind power , they sell it really cheap to norwegians . 
  who then sell it back when it is n't suitably windy in denmark . 
  there may also be possibilities with smaller scale `` smart grids '' and local storage and production ( suggestions include using electric car batteries and other smaller-scale local storage for extra power , and use the same sources in case of threat of brownouts ) . 
  yes , a small professional army will do well in a small-scale conflict . 
  and for larger and richer countries ( in europe france and germany ) , that relatively small army can be well-equipped . 
  same goes for russia : their troops on crimea are no doubt from the professional part of their army , and well-equipped . 
  if they 'd somehow need to throw around the reserves , then we 'd start seeing older hardware . 
  even if russia has a backwards image in the west , they have a lot of natural resources and it 's a damn big country . 
  the war in georgia tells us one thing : proper anti-air can humiliate a numerically superior force . 
  on the ground , though , it does n't matter if the invading tanks are t55s or t72s , if there 's nothing but land rovers on the other side . 
  not sure about the state of georgian at weapons , but i 'd assume that with little opposing armour , the role of a tank would be fire support and the rest of the job would be left for infantry to be done the traditional way . 
  noteworthy that special olympics and paralympics are entirely different events . 
  not sure about winter sports , but in my own sport , there 's a few paralympic athletes that could give a proverbial bloody nose to a lot of healthy `` athletes '' . 
  though yes , this still does give a kind of a signal that russia considers people who are physically handicapped to be classified into the `` cripples and other undesirables '' category . 
  i 'd guessed that sweden , too , has highways that can be prepared to be used as landing strips . 
  ( finland has , what , three regular air bases - if the air force would mobilize , fighters would be spread all over . ), 
  sure , russia has a lot of stuff , and they are modernising their grear , but it is n't all top of the line , either . 
  not like most european armies would n't be boy scout associations with guns . 
  much more economical than maintaining world police . 
  not being tested in an actual shooting war , hard to say how a modern conscript defense force ( of a democratic country ) would fare against professional armed forces . 
  this seems to be somewhat common . 
  after all , ( quite ) some time ago time had [ the map mentioned here ] ( http://www.finnbay.com/f-time-magazine-returns-the-carelian-province-and-lake-laatokka-to-finland/ ) . 
  germany * might * be okay , but poland and lithuania have apparently split kaliningrad oblast . 
  similarly , ukraine and russia seem to have split belarus . 
  half of estonia is marked as russia , but in the return finland has expanded to pre-wwii borders . 
  apcs are n't tanks , but i ca n't deny that putin 's resorting to diplomatic measures . 
  that is , the kind of diplomacy the civilized world knew of 150 years ago . 
  looking at wikipedia , [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukraine_cencus_2001_ukrainian.svg ) [ two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukraine_cencus_2001_russian.svg ) maps about language distribution in ukraine are probably meaningful . 
  do note that in the russian language map the colouring is slightly misleading , as white marks less than ten percent native speakers . 
  the kherson region just north of crimea has almost 3/4 native ukranian speakers . 
  ( of course , native language probably does not map 1:1 on political opinion . ), 
  local ( finnish ) media seems to be drumming up the military exercise near by , along with headlines like `` fighter jets are ready in the air '' . 
  personally , probably just pressure . 
  and russia still has a naval base in crimea , which adds some spice to the situation . 
  distantly related , apparently last night there was some kind of a fight between crimean russians and tatars . 
  independence day parade , and fdf flag day / marshal mannerheim 's birthday parade . 
  and then , for towns near garrisons , the day when conscripts pass basic training and take their oaths . 
  some bigger places have it in the base , but smaller bases like to travel to some nearby town and hold the parade there . 
  though those are mostly people , of course , and less about the military hardware . 
  i used to live near the local `` campus '' of the military college , as evident of the road signs `` watch out for armored vehicles '' . 
  truth , the first thing to die in a conflict . 
  the article lacks details , but i 'd assume that collectors can get licenses for more weapons . 
  iirc , a little bit to the east ( i.e. 
  finland ) it should be possible to get a license to own operational fully automatic and other military weapons as an long-time collector . 
  however , the more potentially dangerous stuff you own , the more there 's paperwork , and the storage is an issue . 
  ( essentially requiring a vault or something equivalent in your house . ), 
  and then there are issues with some collector weapons being deactivated , but possibly repairable to original condition ( as `` weapon parts '' were mentioned ) . 
  grenades would probably be the biggest issue , though it was not mentioned whether those were hand grenades or artillery grenades ( not sure if swedish makes a distiction ? ), 
  not very long time ago a `` collector '' managed to get killed in finland ( ~ ~ i think oulu/ule \u00e5borg ~ ~ kemi ) while trying to deactivate ( ? ), 
  a wwii era artillery round he had found from the wilderness . 
  [ police surrounded the place and called the military in . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/police_uncover_heavy_arms_cache_in_kemi_following_deadly_blast/6831514 ) so , if there 's weapons that were licensed in a given state of repair that have been modified to be `` more functional '' , or there are weapons or explosives that have been improperly stored , or there are unlicensed weapons or explosives , then the licenses are probably going to be revoked . 
  i am * not * a gun law expert , nor i do know anything about swedish law , though . 
  e : spelling/syntax, 
  expanding : saab originally stood for `` svenska aeroplan aktiebolag '' or `` swedish aeroplane ltd. '', 
  funny anecdote from mid-forties : finns had broken soviet diplomatic codes , and as part of [ operation stella polaris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_stella_polaris ) the codes were sold to west . 
  allegedly , truman ordered the codes to be returned to the soviets . 
  oss copied some of them , and to their amazement , noticed that the soviets continued to use the codes that they by now knew to be broken . 
  the gini index for finland ( pg . 
  39 ) is the lowest - i.e. 
  the income is rather equally distributed . 
  the other side of the wealth coin , i.e. 
  assets , probably are n't as equally distributed ( there 's been some talk about having a possible class divide between people who are renting their apartments and people who can afford to own their homes ) . 
  on table 7 ( pg . 
  41 ) i seem to read that as far as the distribution of assets go , finland is pretty mediocre within the compared set of countries . 
  ( by no means a representative set . ), 
  if we can trust wikipedia , [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth ) would seem to indicate that finland is the 9th most equal country in the world if distribution of wealth is considered . 
  ( [ the equivalent list for income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) seems to be a bit incomplete . ), 
  i do n't see guns on their turrets . 
  it would be logical to assume that these were command post or signaling vehicles designed to support the artillery . 
  there 's only a few of those there . 
  * probably * fire control or command post vehicles , not ifvs . 
  well , we 'll see if the ep can get its will thru . 
  of course , we could see a power struggle between the parliament and the council ( which would ominuously remind of the issues with senate/congress in the united states ) , but i do n't think it would be very likely . 
  especially when a single party ca n't probably get an absolute majority in either . 
  the voting system must be proportional , i 've understood . 
  most will probably use [ d'hondt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) , though some use single transferable vote ( northern ireland and ireland at least ) . 
  the votes in d'hondt can be personal ( candidates within party list ordered by popularity , most popular selected proportionally ) or to a party ( predesignated selection order of candidates within the list ) . 
  a group of finns from the backwoods go to have a holiday in italy .
