  they see the sea for the first time in their lives . 
  jussi sees the mediterranean first . 
  he turns and says to his friend : `` matti katso merta ! '', 
  also , if you 're a swede and in finland with two local girls , anna and klara , you should not talk to klara about anna having a bright forehead ( `` annas klara panna '' ) . 
  it gets better , because vowel length is meaningful . 
  `` kusi '' is a vulgar word for `` urine '' . 
  some say that dialects are merely languages without nation-states of their own . 
  now , it is certainly possible to write down finnish nearly phonetically . 
  there are a few exceptions , though , like the common `` yhteen syd\u00e4meen ei mahdu kahta \u00e4mm\u00e4\u00e4 '' ( you ca n't fit two m 's in one heart / you ca n't fit two bitches in one heart , depending whether '' \u00e4mm\u00e4 '' is considered the letter m pronounced or derogatory dialectic word for `` old hag , bitch , wife '' . ), 
  most people pronounce the forms of `` syd\u00e4n '' ( heart ) with m 's with a double consonant . 
  finnish has two official forms : `` kirjakieli '' ( book language ) and '' ( huoliteltu ) yleiskieli '' ( ( carefully-tended ) generic/standard language ) . 
  in school , only kirjakieli is written , but technically it is possible to write the different dialects , too . 
  on most professions , you are also not required to speak yleiskieli , but naturally , if we had , say , a news anchor from rauma ( extreme example ) speaking his/her native dialect , people in the east would n't have a slightest idea what he was saying . 
  traditionally , if you are speaking an uralic language , it is either finno-ugric or samoyedic . 
  ( some linguists apparently consider finno-permic languages a separate subgroup of uralic languages . ), 
  so , hungarian is an ugric language in the finno-ugric subgroup of uralic languages . 
  i do also have a linguist friend who claims that her focus of study ( turkish ) and finnish are obviously related , but i have this far quite not agreed to agree . 
  used to be somewhat common when the candles on christmas trees were real candles . 
  as it states in the end , geert wilders is a dutch populist/nationalist politician . 
  of course he 's going to say that his party will do well . 
  ( to be quite honest , the populists are going to do quite well in many countries , though it still should not be blown out of proportion , at least not beforehand . ), 
  no , the finn in question is the late [ pekka siitoin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pekka_siitoin ) , self-declared `` reichf\u00fchrer '' of finland . 
  his style was so over the top that some `` extreme right activists '' accused him of being a leftist plant to discredit local neo-nazis . 
  edit : apparently this material has been filmed during a seminar of one of siitoin 's `` political parties '' . 
  in quotation marks , because i do n't think they managed to get enough supporters to actually register as a party , even if they could pass the registration process as an association . 
  ( no , it is not legal in finland to register a group with the purpose of replacing the government with a dictatorship . 
  as far as i understand that / r/nottheonion is for ( a ) real news that are ( b ) humorous , but i believe this link does not actually fullfill either of these criteria . 
  around here , the european parliament elections have more `` celebrity candidates '' than national parliament elections . 
  it 's more distant , so there 's two kinds of people interested : those who think about eu careers & other serious politicians , and then the people who fill the lists to get more votes and/or fill additional seats if those are gained . 
  in case of charismatic leaders , the leading candidate can draw in a few people with him ( proportional representation by party/coalition ) . 
  these will be the next most-voted , and these candidates are n't necessarily `` career politicians '' . 
  one of the current finnish meps was a celebrity orthodox minister ( `` minister '' as in `` priest '' ) . 
  chrome used to be a lot faster if you use only few tabs . 
  however , if you use loads of tabs , firefox has always behaved better ( if you 've had the memory ) and now , with memory requirements cut , i 'd rank firefox the better browser . 
  ( with the exception that chrome has better pdf support . ), 
  a research project like this is n't probably ran by a bunch of undergrads . 
  so there will be experts with high salaries . 
  iirc , the total hr expenses to a university will be something like 2.3 times the salary due to other expenses ( administrative costs , keeping offices warm * , maintaining equipment , pension funds , etc. ) . 
  now , if we 're lucky , those guys can also make the vaccine . 
  if their labs do n't have production capability , they 'll probably need to order that from somewhere , and oh boy , it is n't industrialized mass product . 
  might even need a tailor-made arrangement ( probably still in an existing facility ) and lots of experts making sure everything gets done right . 
  okay , now we do have the researchers who know what to do , the vaccine . 
  next we 'll need patients . 
  probably involves paying a whole lot of doctors around the world to do the practical parts , too . 
  and in addition to real type one diabetes patients , there 's a need of a healthy control group . 
  at least the control group is probably compensated for their trouble of getting a shot of experimental medicine . 
  i am not involved with the medical industry , but if they want statistically good results , they 'll want to have a few hundred patients involved , total . 
  possibly some insurance in case something goes wrong , and then some additional insurance in case something goes horribly wrong . 
  and like that , costs creep little by little . 
  or much by much , however you prefer . 
  * ) finland . 
  in warmer countries , replace `` warm '' with `` cool '' . 
  due to [ how d'hondt works ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method#allocation ) , the european parliament will have 3 - 4 large parties . 
  in case of three parties , the largest one may breach the 30 % threshold . 
  therefore , in order to get to the top spot and one-third of the seats , eurosceptics would pretty much need to become more popular than any of the old parties and one of the established parties would need to be more or less completely crushed . 
  ( yes , there are eurosceptics in the traditional parties , but even with them counted in the number , not very likely . ), 
  however , the more worrying part is if a few countries get a straight-eurosceptic government ( i.e. 
  all the relevant government posts ) . 
  that could do a lot of damage in the council of the european union or the european council . 
  that 's some seriously old-fashioned manners . 
  a whole lot of people do n't use hats - and the folks who use their wool soft caps all round the year certain do n't ( and probably should n't ) take them off . 
  typically , looking at people and nodding is an accepted form of greeting ( along with mumbling/grunting something that can be interpreted as `` hei '' ) , unless the other party goes for something more flashy , like waving . 
  i do actually own a wide-brimmed hat , which i do occasionnally use . 
  this message may contain some self-irony . 
  considering that one of the `` latest news '' list on the linked article is '' [ researcher : drinking now a ` common hobby ' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/researcher_drinking_now_a_common_hobby/6873544 ) '' , i assume this alone would get overwhelming acceptance in finland . 
  yes , if the source of randomness is bad , there is a possibility that it affects key strength ( if the attacker knows about a pattern in supposed randomness , the amount of information they need to guess is diminished ) . 
  in case there are other sources of randomness involved ( for example from user interaction , including keypress timings and/or mouse movement ) the effect of this is not as bad as it sounds when these are mixed together . 
  if relying only on `` not actually random '' generator for randomness , it can be bad . 
  edit : [ wikipedia article about the attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/random_number_generator_attack ), 
  also , when thinking about key lengths , aes ( a `` symmetric key '' system ) is n't equivalent to , say , pgp ( which is a public or `` asymmetric key '' system ) . 
  public key systems require longer keys for the obvious reason ( they have a public part that technically anyone could have , used for encoding , and the secret part , which decodes - figuring the secret part is complex , but for short keys possible to do in a reasonable time ) . 
  technically , there is one method that is mathematically not breakable , called one-time pad . 
  however , this requires a key that is at least as long as the message , and underlines the so-called `` key distribution problem '' , i.e. 
  when the message/data is safe , how to make sure the key is safe . 
  naturally , it helps when in a dropbox-type case you 're essentially transmitting to yourself . 
  ( this is why the asymmetric systems are used , since the public key is safe-ish to share when the systems are used properly . 
  as far as i remember , these rely on the difficulty of factoring the products of very large prime numbers , so if that problem ever gets efficiently solved , most of our current asymmetric key methods fail instantly . ), 
  i wonder how many boxes support ssh/sftp these days , at least those which are aimed for consumers . 
  ( plain ol' ftp sends your data in clear . ), 
  des has known to be broken for ages , but aes ( while theoretically broken * ) is still on the `` good enough '' category ( assuming the key is strong , of course ) . 
  that is , when you do it yourself before sending off the data into the wild . 
  the `` rubber hose attack '' ** is the most efficient one and that ca n't be fixed as long as there 's a human component ( i.e. 
  the company providing a service can access encryption keys ) . 
  * ) this means that there exists an attack that is better than trying out all possible key combinations . 
  it 's still not `` fast '' in layman terms . 
  ** ) ability of the attacker to get keys by asking a human . 
  ( caricatyrically , by beating with a rubber hose until keys are yielded . ), 
  in finnish , it is also * skandit * ( `` the scands '' ) or more rarely the older native * k\u00f6livuoristo * ( `` the keel mountains '' ) . 
  finland has 13 seats , currently divided as national coalition ( epp ) 3 , centre ( alde ) 3 , spd ( s&d ) 2 , greens 2 , true finns ( efd ) 1 , swedish people 's party ( alde ) 1 , christian democrats ( epp ) 1 . 
  as a quirk , true finns and cd allied , ( ran with a common list ) . 
  the `` winner '' : alde . 
  centre party has been doing well lately . 
  they 'll probably tie with the national coalition ( epp ) , but the other party in alde from finland , the swedish people 's party , has very loyal voters . 
  the other party in epp , christian democrats , has been hurting and might drop out . 
  ( unless they can run on a common list with other small parties and get lucky . ), 
  true finns ( efd ) will be larger than spd ( s&d ) or greens , but due to the granularity of the scale , i 'd expect them to gain only one seat - especially if and when their chairman stays in the finnish eduskunta and does not run for the ep . 
  so two seats for efd , s&d and greens . 
  the rest probably wo n't be able to gain a seat . 
  unless they have a very popular candidate and run on a common list with another small party , in which case it 'll probably come at the expense of the greens or possibly the swedes ( alde ) . 
  summary for finland ( personal expectations ) : * alde 4 * epp 3 * efd 2 * s&d 2 * greens 2 and one final note : finnish christian democrats are n't like european big christian democrat parties .
