  their origin is as a religious party named christian league , which split off the national coalition . 
  i do believe that there are worse nuclear pollutants than even chernobyl still in operation . 
  they are called coal power plants . 
  however , it is important to note that different types of power are for different purposes . 
  you ca n't just turn a nuclear power plant on and off , so while they provide reliable base power to for example industry , we 'll need still power plants that can output highly variable amounts of power : these are the combustion-based plants and hydropower ( dams ) . 
  investment into solar and wind power will only increase this need , as it becomes necessary to not only compensate for load variance , but also for the variable output of solar and wind power . 
  there are a few solutions , though . 
  one is a smart grid - essentially , optimizing the flow of energy on the fly so that the remaining controllable output plants are used with maximum possible efficiency . 
  the other is building energy storage , but i understand this is very expensive , unless you happen to have a lot of hydro power available ( in europe , this means norway is perfectly positioned to take advantage of renewables , as long as they do n't shy away from building dams , which enable the use of wind ) . 
  for base power , deaths-per-gigawatt over the entire production chain , i do believe we do not yet have a technology that beats nuclear power . 
  of course there are other criteria than human life , especially if the human life in question is spent in some far away country . 
  new types of nuclear plats ( using other fissile materials than uranium ) may also offer some advantages , but i am not sure if there 's a lot of them in the wild ( i.e. 
  outside of laboratories ) . 
  it would be wonderful , though , to have a council of heads of state . 
  i believe juan carlos , at least , would have a few choice words to say about the state of affairs . 
  philippe would consider european politics to be a welcome calm compared to his own country . 
  willem-alexander is kind of new , not sure what he 's like - and i 'm just ill-informed on henri . 
  carl gustav might concentrate on the post-meeting party . 
  as things would drag on , margrethe would light up while elizabeth would frown and tell how churchill would solve the matter . 
  ( most of the presidents are figureheads , and the mentioned heads-of-state are royals and their respective countries do n't have a president . ), 
  european council is where the representatives of the country sit , so those are actually depend on national elections ( mostly parliamentary elections , except for france , lithuania , romania and slovenia , which have a presidential system and send their head-of-state ) . 
  european parliament is different , and this kind of a map does not apply to that , since that election uses d'hondt system and not a winner-takes-it-all system . 
  not sure if i 'd use the word `` epic '' about our modern war heroes . 
  though if we do , [ lauri t\u00f6rni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lauri_t%c3%b6rni ) ( larry thorne ) probably counts . 
  if we look at older , less well-known war heroes from the time when finland was part of other realms , jacob de la gardie probably earns a mention ( [ for taking moscow 1610 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_la_gardie_campaign ) ) , which i guess is a somewhat rare feat ( unless you happen to the title `` khan '' ) . 
  from the swedish times , the most famous finnish ( - born ) soldier is probably [ torsten st\u00e5lhandske ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torsten_st%c3%a5lhandske ) . 
  his noble surname means `` steel gauntlet '' . 
  what he did in the thirty years ' war for the swedes is written in the linked wikipedia article . 
  what it does n't mention of swedish cavalry tactics is that instead of [ caracole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caracole ) , the swedes ( including the finns of that time ) held fire until twenty paces , fired again at five paces , and then attempted to trample and hack their way through the enemy . 
  as evident of him capturing enemy flags in person at [ wittstock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_wittstock ) , st\u00e5lhandske apparently led from the front . 
  ( at wittstock , he was a major general . ), 
  from the russian ( or as we prefer , autonomous grand duchy ) times , probably should mention general erhnrooth . 
  just not quite sure which one , i 've got my books at home and wikipedia is n't very helpful . 
  ( noblesse oblig\u00e9 , the killing profession kind of runs in the family . 
  i count seven generals in the family between 1744 and present day . ), 
  from the late autonomy and early independence , i am probably obliged to mention [ gustaf mannerheim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) . 
  he was a general in the imperial russian cavalry , including an intelligence trip across asia . 
  ( i understand that he could reach modern-day uzbekistan by train , and then spent two years on horseback riding to beijing . ), 
  after the czar fell , he returned to finland , was made chief in command of the loyalist army during the civil war in 1918 , acted as a head of state after the said war , again became the cinc in the three wars that finland fought as parts of the world war ii and became the head of state again ( as the only person who was thought to be able to get finland out of the war - he resigned from presidency in 1946 ) . 
  last war hero in the list might be general of the infantry adolf erhnrooth , who was pretty much known as * the * war veteran in his late years . 
  in the `` greatest finns '' tv show , he was the highest-ranking non-head-of-state . 
  yes , he is one of the general erhnrooths i mentioned earlier . 
  ( he married a danish countess relatively late in life ; their son is currently an officer , as well . ), 
  going for mythological heroes , we probably have to mention [ v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4in%c3%a4m%c3%b6inen ) from the kalevala . 
  talking of kalevala , a whole lot of the original runes that were edited and published as kalevala were collected , on foot , by [ elias l\u00f6nnrot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elias_l%c3%b6nnrot ) . 
  dr. l\u00f6nnrot was also responsible of a good part of forming the written finnish into its current form , as he also wrote the first finnish dictionary . 
  as many concepts did not have a word in finnish ( which was the language of the `` ordinary folk '' ) , this task kind of required some `` original research '' . 
  it might be justified to say that he invented finnish literature . 
  ( literally . 
  there was no word in finnish for `` literature '' until he made up one . ), 
  not all of his invented words stuck , but a whole lot did . 
  he is also one of the few finns with an asteroid named after him ( [ 2243 l\u00f6nnrot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2243_l%c3%b6nnrot ) . 
  not quite sure how many there are . 
  a quick search found at least [ 9793 torvalds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9793_torvalds ) . ), 
  of modern civic leaders , [ urho kaleva kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) has somewhat of an aura of both respect and dread . 
  he was president of the republic for 25 years , something no one else probably could n't even imagine . 
  that said , even when there was no term limit in the law , no one was probably even intended to serve that long . 
  ( after ukk died , a term limit was added . ), 
  [ most of the people in the ceded areas were evacuated . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evacuation_of_finnish_karelia ) not sure how mr. stalin dealt with those who stayed . 
  there is a small but occasionnally vocal group of people who campaign for returning the ceded territory . 
  ( my father 's side grandparents were from the isthmus , old provincial anthem and a few other songs are still a kind of a family anthem . ), 
  official line is that there are no disagreement about the border of any kind between finland and russia . 
  as for `` finnish '' culture on the other side of the border , there has been a revival of interest in the carelian language ( a close relative to finnish ) in the autonomous carelian republic . 
  the southern parts of the ceded territories are n't part of the autonomous areas though , but are part of leningrad oblast . 
  ( yes , the area around st. petersburg is still called leningrad . ), 
  exact amount of talk depends both regionally ( i think my current home town used to be part of the provice viipuri was the capital of ) and culturally ( as the evacuated people were spread around the country ) . 
  organize a seminar about the ceded areas in helsinki , people probably agree that it 's time to go on . 
  we had one at the university , most of the panelists supported some kind of solution that would give finland more access to the ceded territory . 
  i 'd assume that there 's separate keymap for coding when you ca n't use , say , the native-language characters . 
  you get used to using altgr and shift for special characters relatively fast ( in finland , we use the same keymap as swedes - i.e. 
  [ this ] ( http://frontype.com/keyboarding/540px-computer-keyboard-sweden.svg.png ) ) . 
  typing { is irritating , since the right thumb is on altgr , and the first finger ( at least on my small hands ) ca n't reach 7 , so i need to rotate the hand and use the middle finger . 
  as a kid , in the days of dos , i used to memorize the u.s. keymap myself , nowadays been little need since most programs handle the keyboard `` correctly '' . 
  ( except for some games occasionally reverting to u.s. for some reason . ), 
  the belgian is [ jean-claude camille fran\u00e7ois van varenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-claude_van_damme ) . 
  one version of how the different city quarters in my current home town were named involves a story on treating game animals . 
  lipi\u00e4l\u00e4 = `` lyeton '' , a guy who made lye lived there . 
  parkkarila = `` tannerton '' , a guy who tanned hides lived there . 
  ( s ) kinnarila = `` skinnerton '' , a guy who cut the hides lived there . 
  lavola = `` standton '' , a carpenter made market stands and racks . 
  kourula = `` troughton '' or `` mangerton '' , they traditionally made the feeders for the market-goers ' animals . 
  not necessarily everyone living in a village had the same name . 
  in skinnarila ( nowadays better known of the university campus ) there used to be a farm called kinnarila ( back in the day farm names used to be also surnames of the people who lived there , or vice versa ) . 
  tolkien 's preserved response to the germans regarding whether he was `` aryan '' is pure gold . 
  you see , the germans wanted to publish the hobbit ( yes , this is back when it was somewhat new , between the wars ) , but wanted to make sure that the author was clean , so they asked his publisher . 
   i must say the enclosed letter from r\u00fctten & loening is a bit stiff . 
  do i suffer this impertinence because of the possession of a german name , or do their lunatic laws require a certificate of arisch origin from all persons of all countries ? 
   personally , i should be inclined to refuse to give any best\u00e4tigung ( although it happens that i can ) , and let a german translation go hang . 
  in any case i should object strongly to any such declaration appearing in print . 
  i do not regard the ( probable ) absence of all jewish blood as necessarily honourable ; and i have many jewish friends , and should regret giving any colour to the notion that i subscribed to the wholly pernicious and unscientific race-doctrine . 
    you are primarily concerned , and i can not jeopardize the chance of a german publication without your approval . 
  so i submit two drafts of possible answers . 
  one of the drafts was :  thank you for your letter . 
  i regret that i am not clear as to what you intend by arisch . 
  i am not of aryan extraction : that is indo-iranian ; as far as i am aware none of my ancestors spoke hindustani , persian , gypsy , or any related dialects . 
  but if i am to understand that you are enquiring whether i am of jewish origin , i can only reply that i regret that i appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people . 
  my great-great-grandfather came to england in the eighteenth century from germany : the main part of my descent is therefore purely english , and i am an english subject - which should be sufficient . 
  i have been accustomed , nonetheless , to regard my german name with pride , and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war , in which i served in the english army . 
  i can not , however , forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature , then the time is not far distant when a german name will no longer be a source of pride .
