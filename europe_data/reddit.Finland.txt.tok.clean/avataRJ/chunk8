    your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country , but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper , even if it had ( as it has not ) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication , of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my abstammung . 
  1799 platypus anatinus ( flat-footed ducklike ) , 1800 ornithorhynchus paradoxus ( bird-nosed/beaked animal paradox ) . 
  wonder what the aborigines call it ? 
  any defense can be broken with enough explosives . 
  it 's a whole another science how to design embassies and such with dragon 's teeth camouflagued as flower pots and whatnot in front . 
  for peacekeeping purposes they 'd probably use some kind of portable version of the czech hedgehog . 
  soini himself is n't `` far right '' type , he 's just `` whatever gets me a comfy state-paid car and a fat salary '' type . 
  admitted , he 's probably got some nazis in his party , which he likely regrets admitting in retrospect . 
  considering the location of the future power plant , i 'd rather expect it to be a centre party ( ex-agrarian party ) project , but i have to confess that i am not too well-read on the project . 
  the 1988 prize was indeed awarded to `` united nations peacekeeping forces '' ( quite commonly known as the [ blue berets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_berets ) ) and is n't counted for any country . 
  i assume it should be clear from context that this is separate prize , but i 'll edit my comment a bit .

  good school system since it was reformed in 1972 - 1977 . 
  prior to the ww ii we were basically an agrarian nation , and rapid industrialization followed to pay off the soviets . 
  the first finnish nobel laureate had his prize just before the war ( sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 , literature ) . 
  the chemistry one just after the war is connected with agriculture ( way to preserve hay/food for cattle , iirc ) . 
  medicine one is little known in finland , since finnish-born granit worked in sweden , and the peace prize is recent * ( ahtisaari 2008 ) * . 
  ( i do believe a lot of finnish peacekeepers * also * do have papers for the nobel peace prize framed - the blue berets were awarded a collective prize in ' 88 . 
  * this is n't counted for any country , as it is awarded to the united nations .

  like , those apollo missions really got nowhere . 
  and the 13 had really bad problems . 
  though not quite as bad as the shuttle . 
  even in southern finland ( where glacial rebound is slower ) , there are seams in some large buildings so that the structure wo n't crack . 
  crush their economies with development aid , of course !, 
  ( no really , those things need to be thought out a lot better . 
  just pouring resources can make things worse - for example , too much food aid for countries experiencing famine means the remaining local farmers get screwed by offered cheap food , for example . ), 
  i 'd like to reserve a beach vacation in chicago . 
  i mean , turkey . 
  [ piri reis map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piri_reis_map ) , or a fragment of it ? 
  part of the accuracy is that it 's apparently a compilation of different maps - for example , the parts of america being a copy of columbus 's ( now-lost ) map . 
  the ministry of interior estimates [ 80 groups with 1000 people in them ] ( http://www.intermin.fi/en/security/combating_crime/organised_crime ) . 
  i think the few larger biker gangs are the major ones . 
  then there 's a few `` vest gangs '' ( biker gangs minus the bikes ) , and some domestic old school groups . 
  along with a number of foreign groups ( russians , human trafficing gangs - i think some syrians were just caught smuggling people over the eastern border ) . 
  e : finnish wikipedia cites the police giving 81 groups , 1200 people estimate for 2011 . 
  the cited page is no longer accessible . 
  same article says that half of these groups are mc clubs . 
  about 80 % of organized crime in finland is drug related , and since most of that happens thru helsinki , it was investigated by aarnio 's bunch . 
  ... and the estonian chief in defence has noted that any little green men in estonia should be shot on sight .

  eu member countries do n't execute people , but yes , assuming normal civil conditions , i 'd expect a bismarck response .

  traditionally , second-largest party in the coalition gets the deputy / finance post . 
  ministry of foreign affairs ranks third ( so it 'd be stubb , unless the coalition parties decide otherwise ) . 
   may the gods who abandoned us is n't that the other way ? 
  though i blame the previous minister of interior of that . 
  or then it 's time to dig up the kalevalas . 
  eh , most are probably against . 
  even if we 're no longer officially `` neutral '' ( some eu treaties include military co-operation ) , the `` neutrality '' has been a part of the long-standing political liturgy so long that a whole lot of finns actually believe it . 
  in the case of finland , the building pictured is cirrus , a residential tower in helsinki . 
  it is the tallest * residential * building ( 86 m ) , and the building with the most floors ( 26 above ground , two below ) . 
  finnish wiki lists the height as 87.5 m . the tallest conventional building in finland is a hotel in tampere ( hotel torni , meaning `` tower '' ) built last year . 
  it has one above ground floor less , but due to higher floor height , it is two meters taller ( 88 m ) . 
  ( half a meter if we are to trust the finnish language wiki . ), 
  additionally , the finnish wiki lists the mikael agricola church in helsinki as the tallest church . 
  the spire reachest 97 meters ( some sources list 103 meters - the church is six meters above sea level ) , though it is possible to retract the spire on top ( which subtracts 30 meters of height ) . 
  the tallest free standing structure in finland and arguably the tallest building is the n\u00e4sinneula observation tower in tampere ( 168 m ) . 
  there 's a restaurant at 124 meters above ground . 
  economic exclusion zone and territorial waters are two different things . 
  territorial waters are the state 's sovereign territory , whereas eez means that they have the rights to the resources under the waves , but on the surface it is international waters . 
  ( and submarines in territorial waters are a special case - if they are surfaced , they 're counted as ships . 
  if they are submerged , they are automatically assumed hostile . ), 
  and finally , while it is probably most likely that the `` submerged contact '' was a russian sub , it is n't confirmed yet . 
  the fdf is a bit more skittish on making claims than the swedes are . 
  highly depends who all pass - the likes of antti h\u00e4kk\u00e4nen and susanna koski probably ca n't be called liberals . 
  way too late for a proper analysis at least on my part . 
  d'hondt ( same as europarl ) , no minimum amount of votes , but there 's a hidden threshold . 
  13 districts . 
  e : [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_parliamentary_election,_2015 ) seems to have a good summary . 
  95.7 % counted . 
  * centre ( nordic agrarian ) : 49/200 ( +14 ) * national coalition ( conservative ) : 38/200 ( -6 ) * finns ( populist ) : 37/200 ( -2 ) * social democrats : 34/200 ( -8 ) * greens : 15/200 ( +5 ) * leftist : 12/200 ( -2 ) * swedish people 's party ( liberal ) : 9/200 ( + / - 0 ) * christian democrats ( conservative ) : 5/200 ( -1 ) * representative of \u00c5land islands ( expected to work with swedish people 's party ) : 1/200 e : expected changes : nc to 37 seats , finns to 38 seats . 
  the `` no comments '' part is mostly tactics , though . 
  they 're on the lead , so no reason to accidentally try to turn people away from voting them . 
  the irony being that the initial nato plan on defending the baltics allegedly was `` could n't finns defend them ? '', 
  the finnish army is still has armour and artillery , which is n't a given in this continent . 
  ( second-largest artillery in europe , if i am not terribly mistaken . ), 
  the swedes have more or less disbanded their army , but due to maintaining military-industrial complex , their air force and subs are n't too bad . 
  at least if they start keeping stuff manned outside of office hours . 
  the actual system probably depends on the country , but in countries with the cadre system the professional soldiers ' job is to train the reserve . 
  as there are no or very few professional line units , the bulk of the potential wartime force would then be called to arms from the reserves . 
  unless these reserves are properly trained , the newly activated units are not very effective . 
  thus , if the military does n't have the budget to organize exercise maneuvers for the reserve units , then they probably liaison with volunteer organizations . 
  in finland , there 's [ one specific ngo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_defence_training_association_of_finland ) that has this role , taking care of some of the training of volunteers . 
  however , the ngo does not have their own units ( the volunteer [ local defense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/local_defence_troops_%28finland%29 ) are organizationally separate , if probably much overlapping ) . 
  or then you could go to that bar ( siltanen ) in helsinki where the estonian president is going to do a dj gig . 
  ca n't find an announcement in english , sorry . 
  there is a mechanism where citizens can suggest things the parliament should do . 
  in this case , as the article states , there has been a petition to hold a referendum to leave the currency . 
  thus , the parliament will discuss whether such a referendum will be held , and most likely decide that such a referendum is not necessary . 
  the whole petition was started as a publicity stunt by an eurosceptic career politician ( [ hrh paavo i ] ( http://www.kepu.fi/ ) , by grace of [ kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen#legacy ) , the prince of [ keminmaa ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bumfuck,_nowhere ) , a weasel extraordinaire ) , but of course there are enough people to sign it . 
  v\u00e4yrynen has very little support ( d'hondt favours large parties - very difficult for solo candidates to get thru ) and his new party accepts only mps and meps as members , so probably for a while it 'll have a membership of one . 
  also , it is wonderfully twisted for russian nationalists to celebrate a victory by their atheist predecessor with a shiny named after a saint .
