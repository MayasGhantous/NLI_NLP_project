  no comments on awarding one to someone whose country was on the losing side . 
  apparently in song of songs 5:14 the part translated `` his body is like polished ivory decorated with lapis lazuli '' uses a word for `` body '' that is otherwise translated `` loins '' . 
  the finnish translation translated to english would be `` his hips are a piece of art set in ivory , covered with sapphires '' . 
  one interpretation is that the `` loins '' / `` hips '' part made of elephant tusk covered with blue things is , well , um . 
  finnish loans a whole lot of words . 
  our word for mother ( '' \u00e4iti '' ) is a loan word . 
  estonian has retained the old `` ema , em\u00e4 '' which in finnish is used only for animals . 
  as old as the bible . 
  essentially , in a part of the bible king solomon tells ( poetically ) that he 's packin ' . 
  cnut the great , alternatively spelled knut . 
  or * kn\u00fatr inn r\u00edki * if you insist on old norse . 
  well , the old dialects have been slowly disappearing . 
  before radio broadcasts , dialectic boundaries were much clearer . 
  but yes , we do have some relics from extinct languages . 
  and we still have officials with a job to figure out words for new things , some of which catch and some of which do n't . 
  the `` pipliasuomi '' ( bible finnish ) was strongly based on western dialects , but later changes and additions mean that current `` yleiskieli '' ( generic finnish , standard finnish ) mixes different dialects more evenly . 
  people who mostly speak standard finnish might have hard time understanding a heavily dialectic speech from a hundred years ago . 
  as a minor note , finland has a minority speaking swedish as their native tongue . 
  the local dialect in n\u00e4rpes , however , is quite close to old swedish . 
  or if we insist on comparison to languages which are n't supposed to have gone extinct 500 years ago , icelandic . 
  i did n't know anyone alive who owned a gun until recently in finland . 
  ( grand-uncle owned a dozen or so - a few shotguns , a rifle for hunting moose , an old military rifle for small game , etc. ), 
  however , a colleague does practical shooting and owns a few applicable guns , and i recently learned that one of my students does hunt ( so assumably owns a few guns ) . 
  however , i 'd expect that as urbanization progresses , guns per capita goes down ( because it 's a lot easier to go hunting if you live in the countryside or in a small town ) . 
  in finland , the office of the president is almost stripped of its powers ( though the president can still hold speeches , including giving the ministers a serious talking-to , and also name important officials independently of what the government suggests ) . 
  most importantly , however , the president traditionally resigns from any parties he or she has belonged to and is supposed to be a unifying figure . 
  especially now when post-election the parties make a deal who form the coalition ( though the largest one gets a shot on the prime minister 's office ) , the president is selected directly by the people , not by party officials . 
  ( president halonen was pretty famous for disregarding what the government suggested . ), 
  the president used to be pretty powerful , and one of the president abused the powers on top of staying on top for 25 years , his successors made sure that does n't repeat and that there are more checks on the president 's power . 
  currently there 's some discussion if we 've gone a bit too far . 
  if the crap hits the fan , the president is expected to hand out the chief-in-command position to a general , but the state of defense law is still a fine example how the president technically has the power to turn the republic into a military dictatorship . 
  ( the parliament gets a veto , though . ), 
  we do n't have mountains either , but it helps that the country is quite forested . 
  ( well , you probably can still drive a tank thru the farmed forests , though . ), 
  at least in finland , this includes an estimate on illegal guns , and apparently in germany as well . 
  one person probably owns more than one gun . 
  this is guns per people , not guns per households or gun-owning people per all people . 
  iirc , the amount includes an estimate on illegal guns at least in finland ( and apparently in germany , too ) . 
  well , at least we got to trade something back to our nordic cousins . 
  ( after all , i understand that the `` patriotic '' movement that styles itself as `` the resistance '' is essentially a chapter of the swedish organization . ), 
  wonder if these guys have clean in the eyes of the law ? 
  ( it was slightly amusing that a majority of the guys who started patrolling as `` sons of odin '' in finland to `` provide safety '' apparently had a record themselves . ), 
  there were two legitimate demonstrations going on : a protest against racism on a square near the railway station and the anti-immigration march from narinkkatori to senate square , which probably passed the other demonstration a few blocks away . 
  a group of twenty people , described by ~ ~ the police ~ ~ * yle * as `` leftist radicals '' tried to obstruct the anti-immigration march and were guided away by the police . 
  three of them returned and were arrested by the police for the duration of the demonstration and fined for insubordination . 
  actually , that mosque serves a congregation which only accepts ethnic tatars . 
  other groups do have their houses and spaces , but as far as i am aware , none of them are purpose-built mosques . 
  at the moment , there is only one mosque in finland , built in 1942 in [ j\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4rvenp%c3%a4%c3%a4_mosque ) . 
  and when it comes to style , it looks [ very finnish ] ( http://www.keski-uusimaa.fi/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/doris/processed/images/23325367.jpg?itok=nohth-4l ) . 
  ( various islamic organizations do additionally have prayer spaces , but the pictured small tower is the only minaret in finland . ), 
  pretty sure op is finnish , and when spotting this source , mtv in finland had n't either linked the vice article they used to write the piece of news or the op missed it . 
  ( [ linking it pretty soon afterwards . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4385n4/finnishfelix_baumgartner_a_country_where_one/czg841n ) ), 
  the russian border is controlled , but naturally , if you can cross it and apply for asylum , i guess they ca n't turn the person back . 
  and local yellow papers have been screaming that there are tens of thousands of refugees that the russians might unleash upon us . 
  in finland , everyone can fish without a permit . 
  that is , as long as you are using only a ( single ) hook and line ( float and rod optional ) . 
  some locations may be restricted ( typically rapids of salmon-rich rivers ) . 
  ... not sure if that 's the case in austria . 
  finland has a tiny weeny issue : before they can get the law changed , it is strictly illegal to send the finnish defense force abroad except for `` crisis management '' ( peacekeeping ) . 
  of course , some people have asked questions on why we did sign the eu treaty and did n't enact legislation that 'd allow keeping the treaty in full ( but there 's also a whole lot of people who still think that we 're a neutral country and will raise hell if the defense force can be sent abroad ) . 
  there 's a law change coming , but ~ ~ since ~ ~ * until * then , the official line is that we 'll try to wiggle into some peacekeeping operations to free up people who can fight elsewhere . 
  e : late in the evening , my grammar/vocabulary seems to go down the drain . 
  the funny part is that after independence , we were briefly a republic , then after the civil war some folks thought that in good old fashioned monarchy such things would have never happened and proceeded to elect a king ( falling back to old swedish legislation that technically might have never been taken out of use in finland - how to elect the monarch if the dynasty dies out - and the romanovs did ) . 
  they wanted a german prince to secure help from germany . 
  well , they did n't get the kaiser 's sons , but they did get friedrich karl of hesse . 
  but then germany lost ww i , and frederik kaarle said `` thanks , but no thanks '' to solve the little dilemma of having one of the ex-kaiser 's close relatives a monarch in europe . 
  and then , finland became a republic again , with strong presidential powers as a compromise . 
  how the succession would have went is a bit fuzzy , because we did n't get a king in the first place , but apparently the crown prince would have been wolfgang von hesse . 
  after that , there are a few options , making the `` pretender '' either henrik donatus von hesse ( by primogeniture ) or philipp von hessen ( assuming the head of the family would be only the landsgraf , and the finnish crown would 've gone to a junior family member ) . 
  at least for lower-quality stuff , you get the finished part from china often cheaper than our local steel factory can make the raw material . 
  it 's just crazy . 
  of course , it just might happen that if you send your blueprints to china , a chinese manufacturer starts then making a similar product . 
  ( no , not a copy - if you 're really unlucky , their replacement parts do fit your product , but it 's different enough that your replacement parts do n't fit theirs . ), 
  as far as i understand , it is a hard vacuum inside . 
  so whatever heat expands is because the miniature star inside is radiating quite a bit of energy . 
  of course , a lot of it is gamma and other stuff we ca n't harness , but a lot of energy can be collected . 
  collecting more that is needed to keep the fusion going , now that 's the tricky part . 
  to the east in the gulf of finland the water level can raise by two meters if the wind blows from the west . 
  this is why the russians built a huge dam to protect st. petersburg , which is built on old swampland in the very bottom of the gulf . 
  helsinki is 80 km away . 
  this is the view to tallinn harbour from the opposite side of the city . 
  syrians shot down a turkish f-4 . 
  ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_2012_interception_of_turkish_aircraft ) ), 
  at least the other plane in the pictures is apparently flying a circular pattern . 
  you see , a jet fighter can turn while it is in the air . 
  i was unable to find information of the loiter speed of the su-24 , which is indeed designed for fast low altitude flying , so its abilities to `` loiter '' are worse than , say , su-25 which is designed for that kind of a thing . 
  edit : if the su-24 flew from syria , we can expect that it has up to 90 minutes of endurance , based on how a craft of similar model ( not sure of differences within different variants ) `` buzzed '' a us destroyer in the black sea . 
  ( [ link ] ( http://news.usni.org/2014/04/14/russian-fighter-buzzes-u-s-destroyer-black-sea ) ), 
  this assumes that the turkish to english translation is perfect . 
  right now , unless we have someone who can read turkish check the original source , we do n't know - but it sounds as a reasonable explanation ( even if still a somewhat unreasonable response , even if it is in response to a 2012 shootdown of a turkish aircraft ) . 
  if they do have a policy to warn aircraft as they get close to the border and the plane was loitering near the border , it could 've been there for half an hour as far as we know . 
  five minutes is easily doable . 
  i understand that the turkish pilots were waiting with the finger on the trigger and shot once the plane was over the border ( at least according to their radars ) . 
  this is about the warnings , which probably were issued before the plane entered turkish airspace . 
  the m-looking marks on one of the red flight paths ( there are two in the picture ) mark the location of the aircraft when the missile was launched and when the missile hit , as far as i understand that . 
  that was indeed obvious . 
  responded anyway . 
  the total number of jets ( trainers ) in the baltic inventory is three ( 3 ) . 
  there 's a reason why baltic air policing is done by nato allies , currently hungary and germany .
