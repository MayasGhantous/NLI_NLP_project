  for example , here 's statistics from some nationalities from 2013 ( source tilastokeskus.fi , statistic generator ) . 
  the working percentage by nationality from highest to lowest : estonia 51,6 nigeria 51,3 germany 48,6 finland 42,4 sweden 41,1 china 36,5 turkey 35,4 afghanistan 11,2 iraq 9,5 somalia 7,9, 
  what ? 
  mustalainen = gypsy . 
  although i have respect for storebrorsan sverige , i 'd say we are culturally closer to v\u00e4ikevend eesti . 
  i agree but i guess it 's a bit problematic to force people to join this kind of an experiment only because they happen to live in a town participating in it . 
  most of these i can confirm , although the central finland stereotype is new to me ... 
  here 's a shorter summary : ** helsinki ** : arrogant assholes ** espoo ** : rich capitalists ** vantaa ** : poor people and alcoholics ** eastern finland / north carelia ** : racists and unempolyed alcoholics ** savo ** : crooked / dishonest people talking constantly ** turku ** : the asshole of finland ** rauma ** : no one understands their language ** south-western finland ** : swedish-speaking fishermen ** ostrabotnia ** : cows and surly rednecks with knifes ** lapland ** : mosquitos , reindeer and their herdsmen ** h\u00e4me ** : slow people ** central finland ** : no one even remember their existence , so no stereotypes here i 'm from helsinki myself . 
  why does n't un also condemn finland 's gender-discriminating military service law ? 
  military service / civilian service is only mandatory if you happen to be born with testicles . 
  yes , apparently : coffee-iceland drinks energy caffeine . 
  and i thought the finns like coffee . 
  they did n't rate any country . 
  they were n't asked . 
  canada would probably be rated very high . 
  much higher than the us . 
  everyone loves you . 
  `` istu mu kyrval '' ( estonian ) = sit next to me , `` istu mun kyrv\u00e4l '' ( finnish ) = sit on my dick, 
  i think this is very much true . 
  i have three spanish friends studying in finland . 
  once we started to discuss the economy and politics in spain , and all the three spaniards ended up lashing their home country like it was the worst place on earth , while me , the only finn around the table , tried to defend spain . 
  that was bizarre . 
  interesting . 
  but i still do n't get it - why do n't people vote for the less corrupted parties in order to change the constitution ? 
  why is it so difficult to get 60 % ? 
  one would think that a constitutional amendment would be of highest priority in people 's minds when electing new members of the parliament . 
  the greeks have pride but no honor . 
  i do n't want to offend anyone , but that 's just how it looks like from a northern european point of view . 
  a huge cultural difference regarding fair play and honesty . 
  do n't you know that even finlandsvenskar swear in finnish since the swedish swear words are so lame . 
  russian gays are even seeking asylum in europe because of the persecution . 
  finland just granted asylum for one gay couple . 
  http://news.yahoo.com/russian-gay-couple-gets-asylum-finland-report-190726774.html welcome to finland . 
  we had 20 \u00bac in finland yesterday and pretty much the same view on the beach . 
  it 's unusually warm now . 
  today it may rise to 22-23 . 
  the effect of immigration on the finnish economy is negligible . 
  the government is cutting benefits ( not removing any , really ) because of a recession that has been going on for 10 years . 
  the recent wave of asylum seekers is a fly shit in the big picture . 
  sweden has maybe not been practicing a sustainable immigration policy , but at least they can keep their economy growing unlike finland . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm not a fan of superstitious rites and therefore not of halal slaughtering , but the conditions the animals have to live in should be of much higher interest than how it dies ( as it 's anyway very fast and efficient ) , if we really care about animal welfare . 
  well , if the whole world knew finnish , i 'm sure we would n't be so eager to learn other languages either . 
  barley is probably one of the most cultivated grains but it is surely not the most eaten ? 
  it 's used a lot as animal feed and beer of course . 
  some traditional foods are made of barley however , like a flat bread called rieska . 
  rye bread is the most popular type of bread in finland . 
  it 's traditionally made of sourdough by fermenting , but today the most common rye bread is made using yeast and contains often also wheat . 
  oat porridge is what most of us used to eat for breakfast as kids . 
  i still do . 
  yummy . 
  even in a t-shirt you can survive several hours , however it 's gon na get uncomfortable and painful in a few minutes for most people . 
  hands and fingers will be the first parts to get cold and stiff and develop frostbite in maybe an hour or so . 
  but you can stay out comfortably the whole day in -12 c with proper clothing . 
  when it 's -20 or colder i prefer not to stay outside for more than 1-2 hours if i can avoid it , especially if it 's windy . 
  the face will freeze and risk frostbite even if the rest of the body is well covered . 
  hmm , i did n't know we have hills in helsinki ? 
  norway has the best cross-country skiers in the world and an amazing sport culture in general . 
  i love how everyone does sport in norway . 
  germany : thanks for keeping order , and lidl ireland : thanks for your great sense of humor sweden : thanks for making us a part of western europe spain : thanks for the warm weather and warm people russia : thanks for the blins belgium : thanks for the chocolate, 
  as if we will ever implement any reforms in finland ( 5.5 million people ) . 
  the labor unions have too much power and no one is ready to give up any achieved benefits , even when it means higher and higher unemployment and lower and lower exports etc. 
  i 'm not sure what you 're upset about . 
  why would n't someone maybe need psychiatric ward if they are 13 ? 
  i think it makes a difference . 
  nordic countries are very secular and have been like that for a long time . 
  religion is considered a private thing which should n't be forced on others . 
  after getting rid of superstitious rites , i 'm not comfortable with importing new ones . 
  we are going backwards if we allow an imam to cast his spell on everything we eat . 
  it 's not just words , it 's an ideology based on superstition . 
  seriously ? 
  that ca n't be true , can it ? 
  hard to believe you would n't practice normal slaughtering in denmark anymore . 
  edit : ok , i read further down and it seems to be true . 
  unbelievable . 
  finnish/estonian somewhat , although estonians seems to understand finns better than the other way around . 
  hungarian - no way . 
  despite a couple of similar words and kind of similar rhythm , it 's a totally different language . 
  yes i got what it means , although j\u00e4\u00e4-\u00e4\u00e4ri would be an artificial word in finnish . 
  we say j\u00e4\u00e4n reuna . 
  ( \u00c4\u00e4ri has more of an abstract meaning for edge . ), 
  oh yes , we also have `` paatti '' , which means a small boat . 
  so silly . 
  finnish makes more sense : t\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 - work night - ty\u00f6y\u00f6 \u00d6\u00f6t\u00f6\u00f6 - night work - y\u00f6ty\u00f6, 
  explanation : finnish translation for venemaa would be boatland . 
  it 's finland . 
  we have similar signs . 
  i 've learned the connection between the finnish and hungarian languages for the first time in primary school . 
  later it 's been discussed both in secondary and high school . 
  maybe you just have n't paid attention in class ... ? 
  it 's disturbing that even young boys who have barely reach puberty engage in this behavior . 
  seems like a lot of fun judging from their laughing faces . 
  reminds me of my vacation in tunisia a few years a ago , when even 10-year-old boys were whistling at us ( ladies aged 20 + ) . 
  we thought it was kind of funny , i 'm not sure anymore . 
  no it 's not . 
  it mentions the cologne happenings as well but mainly discusses the same things as the yle article . 
  no time for proper translation , but here 's the crappy google translation for you : `` helsinki police says intensified oversight of the new year celebrations and they were prepared for the broad asylum seekers assembly . 
  according to police , it was received before the new year hint that by asylum seekers in the metropolitan area would have been possible parallel plans to the train station in cologne , germany that convened in men . 
  cologne , about a hundred women has made a declaration of sexual harassment in the new year . 
  similar cases were also in hamburg and stuttgart .
