  iraqis asylum seekers have arrived in helsinki told the new year holidays from elsewhere in finland and in addition to the city 's own reception centers . 
  railway station station in the tunnel had to eleven at the time of up to 1 000 iraqi asylum-seekers . 
  police removed the scene dozens of people , and in the early evening was apprehended several individuals . 
  - the police have been informed of the three harassment cases , of which two have been reported to the police . 
  in retrospect , it has become known that this would have occurred in the downtown area in general . 
  police harassment takes every case seriously and urges them to always report the crime . 
  it is regrettable that the cases should be information often only in retrospect , and they have not told the police officers patrolling the spot or order of men , says the helsinki police department deputy chief , ilkka koskim\u00e4ki . 
  koskim\u00e4ki of the more serious disruptive behavior it was possible to prevent the police a good frontloading , transparent controls and to intervene in a low . 
  police director general seppo kolehmainen , the new year 's eve police occupation is anyway usual evening higher . 
  - new year 's eve there is anyway a need to invest in the city , and riskier patrols , regardless of whether we asylum seekers or not . 
  new year 's eve police services will always be needed and therefore the workforce is much more focused that night , says kolehmainen news broadcast on mtv . 
  according to kolehmainen , any mass harassment design motives can only be guessed at . 
  - in general , issues relating to asylum-seekers are sensitive to , the motives can only be guessed at . 
  of course , now you should take a cool analytically thing at a time and put some ice cap in this . 
  let 's take things matters , and l\u00e4hdet\u00e4 stir up anything , says police commissioner seppo kolehmainen . '', 
  in finnish : http://yle.fi/uutiset/helsingin_poliisi_kolnin_hairinta_uhkasi_tapahtua_myos_helsingissa__1_000_turvapaikanhakijaa_asematunnelissa/8576615 `` according to the police , asylum seekers may have had planning similar plans in helsinki as in cologne , germany . 
  three assaults were reported to the police in the new years eve . '', 
  but another , updated article tells something different : `` head of national bureau of investigation : no similar plans in finland as in cologne '' http://yle.fi/uutiset/krpn_tutkinnanjohtaja_suomessa_ei_suunniteltu_vastaavaa_kuin_kolnissa/8576981 anyhow , over 1000 asylum seekers gathered to the central railwaystation tunnel in helsinki to celebrate . 
  they had arrived to helsinki from different parts of finland . 
  okay ... 
  in the 6th happiest country in the world ? 
  are you sure ? 
  both these things are norms in finland as well . 
  how do you spot a russian in finland ? 
  he does n't know how to queue . 
  trying to enter a bus with a group of russian tourists is frustrating since they apparently do not understand why people are standing in a line and why the first ones should step in first . 
  so there 's no risk of carrying the weird fungus or some contagious bacteria into the house in shoes that may have been walking around in dirt and filth and dog poo and who knows what else ? 
  anyway , in nordic countries , for about 350 days a year people wear socks in their shoes , so usually they will not be barefoot after taking the shoes off . 
  helsinki , december 24th 2015 : http://imgur.com/a/7tsfa like any summer morning . 
  it 's also called pillupuhelin , pussy phone . 
  we also have different names of months . 
  even estonia has the jan , feb. . . names but we have totally different finnish names . 
  do n't know about hungary ? 
  hey that 's interesting , finnish also has puolitoista which means literally the same as halvanden ( = 1,5 ) . 
  we do n't use another `` halfs '' anymore though . 
  the modern joulupukki ( santa claus ) is such a wimp compared to the good old [ yule goat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yule_goat ) . 
  never heard of a goat delivering presents in modern times . 
  exactly . 
  we have 3-4 different types of herring , 2-3 salmon dishes , and 2-3 types of caviar ( roe e.g. 
  from vendace , rainbow trout , pike perch ) . 
  those are for starters though , the main dish is ham . 
  this is not about the citizens ' `` right to keep and bear arms '' , but about the military and effective defense ( against russia ) . 
  it 's not like normal people here want to carry guns like in the us . 
  i agree with your point and i do n't blame the refugees who want to leave because of living in a shithole like a reception center ( although obviously their life is not in the greatest danger ) . 
  i could n't take it either . 
  it 's just sadly all we can offer for now . 
  and even if could offer better conditions for the application process , i 'm not sure we should , because that would greatly increase the ones who come as economic migrants not qualifying for refugees , again putting greater pressure on the system , leading to more cramped accomodation etc. . . 
  so unfortunately , the real refugees just need to try to survive for the few months of the application process . 
  you get it after eating a sandwich on the airport ? 
  sunrise in helsinki today : 9:11 sunset : 15:17 sunrise in oulu today : 10:20 sunset : 14:04, 
  exactly . 
  if 20 000 arrive and 300 leave , 19 700 are still staying . 
  ( did n't bother to check the exact numbers but that 's close enough ) . 
  i 'm sure he 'd be happier in sweden , sleeping in a tent in the slush , everything else being the same . 
  no concrete short-term benefits . 
  but the reasoning behind the ban on death penalty goes beyond that . 
  showing that you are capable of handling violence without violence sends a message and contributes to a less violent society . 
  i 'm not religious myself , but the christian ideal of not seeking revenge but conquering evil with good and loving your enemy is something that made western civilizations superior to others in many ways . 
  it 's hard to hate someone who does n't hate you back . 
  ( even as an atheist i try to apply this philosophy to my own moral principles . ), 
  i 'm aware of that we still use punishments ( jail is a punishment ) , but they are non-violent punishments . 
  well , it 's hard to prove cause and effect , but after a cut in the alcohol tax in 2004 the consumption increased , and after the rises in the alcohol tax 2008-2009 it decreased again . 
  i wonder if they are still active isis members who came to finland planning to be involved in possible future terrorist acts or recruit new isis members , or if they actually wanted to escape from isis and have a new future . 
  hope we 'll know after the investigation . 
  that username, 
  we are best in recession in the whole europe , wuhuu . 
  i 'd say that 's a good reason to party hard tonight . 
  now apparently a police station in skellefte\u00e5 is isolated and guarded by `` heavily armed policemen '' . 
  http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21797046.ab this has something to do with the arrest of the suspected terrorist , but the police wo n't tell more . 
  update : the situation was over at 8 am today . 
  cutting healthy erogenous tissue from baby boys as a standard procedure and thinking that it 's not a big deal and somehow necessary is definitely not a thing in europe . 
  why would you do that in a civilized country ? 
  many iraqis and somalis already have family or friends in finland which is why they want to come here . 
  as opposed to syrians , who do n't really have connections here but in sweden . 
  `` interior ministry : finland set to reject two thirds of asylum seekers '' http://yle.fi/uutiset/interior_ministry_finland_set_to_reject_two_thirds_of_asylum_seekers/8446795 reaching the limit . 
  dunno , in the world happiness report 2015 we seem to be ranked 6th , while greece is on place 102 , right between swaziland and lebanon . 
  funny how they show all these small european nations separately , and then there 's `` west africa '' . 
  `` they all look the same !, 
  '' , right ? 
  in finland the students are given a lot of responsibility of their own studies , true . 
  so slackers are not pushed . 
  in high school i honestly did my math homework less than 5 times during the 3 years . 
  i still graduated with fairly good grades . 
  but it was kind of a shock when i started my university studies and realized that i actually have to use some of my free time to study in order to pass the courses . 
  i used to these prejudices about indian people that they smell like curry and do not respect women . 
  but after working with some i 've noticed that most are great people : smart , funny , hard-working and humble . 
  and at least the ones i worked with had no problems working with women . 
  they do smell like curry though . 
  game industry is fairly big in finland . 
  in the beginning of the week , the russian media asked russian citizens to stay away from finland , sweden , of norway , if they have small children . 
  according to them , russian kids can be taken from them and given to gay and lesbian parents . 
  at least 30 different sources started spreading the news suddenly , attacking the finnish social authorities . 
  the reason is the case of a 13-year-old girl who where taken into custody in middle finland . 
  according to the mother , she was taken from her because she had told her not to be friends with finnish children . 
  here are some of the original russian sources : http://tass.ru/obschestvo/2294361 http://www.rg.ru/2015/09/28/finlyandiya-site.html http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1539616 http://regions.ru/news/2561113/ http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1503436/ http://www.kompravda.eu/online/news/2170445, 
  are these people expecting the un to punish finland for not adding enough spices in their free chili con carne ? 
  what does he mean they have to drink water from the toilet `` like animals '' ? 
  tap water in finland is among the purest in the world . 
  unless he 's drinkig from the toilet seat .
