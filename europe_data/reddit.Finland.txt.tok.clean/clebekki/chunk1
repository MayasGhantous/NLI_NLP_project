probably something anti-russian written on her bosom . 
  glorious , yet again one thing in which we beat sweden !, 
  both in wins and medals . 
  loved the sport when i was in my teens , not surprisingly those years were also when finns were at the top of the game . 
  and it was 90 % just other nordics on the medal table too . 
  @ 0:49 http://i.imgur.com/ykqtivv.gif source is kinda related too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9deuvte-4ju, 
  in common usage we use comma , so 1,5 + 2,5 = 4,0 . 
  in scientific or technical usage we use period , i think , but it 's ok to use comma too , but you have to be consistent . 
  i know , i thought about it for a second ... again . 
  since reddit is mostly in english , should i use the anglo style decimal point ? 
  hells no !, 
  also i do n't use cubic furlongs or hogwarts or whatever to measure water . 
  that allowance meaning you only pay for anything over 30 000 litres ? 
  checked my last 6 month bill , i live alone and used 15,6 m \u00b3 of water at 4,130 $ / m \u00b3 . 
  30 cubic meters seems about right . 
  is it really true that norway has crappy roads ? 
  i 've heard this before a few times . 
  you should use some of that oil to put in quality asphalt and to pay for the asphalt . 
  the audio is much , much more eerie . 
  but you really have to understand all the languages spoken on the tape to get the full effect . 
  the moment of realization and when the whole tone of everyone changes ... `` dom \u00e4r i sj\u00f6n ! '', 
  most of canada has it even worse , absolutely no alcoholic beverages of any kind in grocery stores in ontario , for example . 
  you get beer from beer stores and other alcohol at lcbo stores , their alkos . 
  putin is going for a gorbachev look with that white sea . 
  humour , however dark , is sometimes necessary for you to keep it together during tough times . 
  the aid convoys to eastern ukraine remind me of how they dropped bread from the sky to the starving finns during winter war ... their lies and excuses are pathetic . 
  i get quite excited , especially women 's pole vault , high & long jumps and heptathlon are very titillating to watch . . 
  i based the list on this study . 
  beats me . 
  part of the reason must be our long and cold winters and relative lack of indoor facilities for football . 
  football culture is also in it 's infancy here still . 
  finland : 1 . 
  ice hockey 2 . 
  athletics / track & field 3 . 
  skiing edit : that was for viewing , as for under 18 year old 's sports club membership the list would be : 1 . 
  football 2 . 
  gymnastics 3 . 
  ice hockey and just for general hobby for all ages : 1 . 
  cycling 2 . 
  swimming, 
  some of the cheese ( and yogurt and other dairy stuff ) meant for the russian market were put in finnish stores for about half the price , since they only had labels in russian . 
  they sold like a mofo , partly because it was cheap , partly because of the novelty and partly because russians bought them too . 
  bundesliga has the highest attendance of any league in europe , maybe that , dunno . 
  and why is he shooting at that poor mother duck ? 
  a lot of jumbo jets and airbus giants heading to eastern asia , japan especially , take that route . 
  that 's nice , i love european old towns , good to see them restored in romania too . 
  do you know what they are building there , and what was there before ? 
  joensuu , yes . 
  noljakka , no . 
  east side represent , what what . 
  i kinda like the look , and in dayz they have the best loot out of all civilian buildings , 
  the house on the right looks like `` the piano house '' in dayz . 
  [ you and me both , bro . 
  spectacular !, 
  http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/norway/hammerfest it 's pretty wicked , there theoritically is some sort of twilight this late in the summer , but it 's pretty light . 
  compare that to budapest for example , hours of total darkness . 
  typically finnish . 
  even if you 're in the middle of a city , you are still in the middle of a forest . 
  edit : fun fact , the first pic was taken just before 3 in the morning . 
  june . 
  you as in who ? 
  easter nor halloween are nowhere close to equinoxi . 
  that sounds very much like the finnish [ juhannus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midsummer#finland ) ( midsummer ) . 
  very old pagan stuff later named after bible people . 
  i think most of europe has some kind of midsummer celebration , at it 's origin is always pagan . 
  space plumbing ? 
  after all that hullabaloo some dude wrote a book called `` conan o'brienin maailma '' ( conan o'briens world ) and it sold pretty well . 
  i have it , got it as a christmas present . 
  dunno why , i 've never liked conan that much . 
  yeah , when the south park episode where the world nuked finland was aired it was a huge thing in finland . 
  we got mentioned in south park !, 
  or when the amazing race had a pitstop in finland ( or when they were * near * finland in norwegian & swedish lapland ... ) . 
  or when james may did a top gear segment in finland . 
  or ... the list goes on , it 's always in the tabloids . 
  we have a ` laululava ' in joensuu too , but wow that 's impressive . 
  yes , that is truly the reason . 
  i fail to see how ice hockey is commercially unfriendly . 
  they even added special `` advertisement timeouts '' , many in each period . 
  hockey is extremely tv friendly compared to football , which has no time outs or other chances for ad breaks . 
  the clocks keeps on running , 45 minutes at a time , nonstop . 
  what 's that got to do with anything i said ? 
  football wo n't ever be very popular in the states because it 's not advertising , and therefore tv , friendly . 
  in all the major sports the clock is stopped all the time ( or no clock at all ) so it 's easy to stop the clock just for the ad breaks too . 
  there are running paths everywhere , also in cities , and four to six months of the year they are pretty much converted into ski tracks . 
  naturally the more south and/or west you go in europe , the more you have to travel to be able to ski . 
  there are roller skis , but it 's not the same . 
  this may be a silly sausage thread , but i still learnt a lot . 
  ... of steel . 
  limpdick sweden would need that . 
  oh wait , this is n't / r/polandball . 
  ^ i ^ love ^ you ^ sverige !, 
  he 's a swede . 
  love , finland . 
  they are amazing . 
  hard outer shell with salmiakki powder inside . 
  and if you crush them and mix with vodka , you get excellent salmiakki-flavoured booze . 
  also ** s ** ub ** u ** rban ** v ** ehicle, 
  we can also say chilipippuri , which is chili pepper , which is chili paprika , which is paprika . 
  or an old school term turkinpippuri ( turkish pepper ) , which is also a name for salmiakki candy ( [ tyrkisk peber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyrkisk_peber ) ) .
