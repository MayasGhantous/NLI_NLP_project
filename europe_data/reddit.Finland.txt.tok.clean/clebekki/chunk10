  same for german . 
  i understand writing pretty well still , can navigate swedish or german websites/stores easily and stuff like that . 
  but the good thing is , the basics are now in the brain . 
  if i were ever to move to sweden or germany , i 'd be constantly exposed to the language and i 'd probably pick it up quickly again . 
  so i do n't think all those years of learning were wasted . 
  same in finland . 
  i almost never see it happening here . 
  75k city in finland . 
  edit : exception being if there is [ this particular sign ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@62.6047291,29.7530658,3a,63.3y,141.62h,89.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seveg3cgjp5klbvax5-p0bw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-gb ) . 
  if you want to look at the silver lining , the hundreds of millions of dollars of war reparations the soviets demanded kickstarted finnish metal industry . 
  now seen as success stories like nightwish and children of bodom . 
  i have a large red beard , and east asians often stare at me . 
  i think i look normal/nothing out of the ordinary so must be the beard . 
  it may be part of the reason , but not a very big part , otherwise finland would be much lower too . 
  after ww2 finland lost [ over 10 % of its land to russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/finnish_areas_ceded_in_1944.png ) , with that also access to lake ladoga and the arctic ocean , and one of our biggest cities vyborg . 
  in comparison the area lost was about as big as estonia or denmark . 
  it 's not really a political issue anymore . 
  something like 99 % of the finnish population was evacuated and the lost areas have since been repopulated by russians and ex-soviets . 
  of course there are some people who still entertain the thought of `` get karelia back !, 
  '' , it pops up in the media every now and then , but it 's mostly used in jest for the vast majority of people . 
  ok , last time i had to buy cigarettes was this spring , ca n't remember the brand but it was 6,50 e. 
  probably marlboro red , first thing that came to mind at the store . 
  i thought they raised the taxes again 1st of july so i guestimated ~ 7e . 
  the price of a cigarette pack is 16-24 dollars in the us ? 
  lately i have been regularly playing tekken 7 and civilization vi . 
  also been clearing my bundle backlog of indie point 'n' click adventures , a couple games i recently finished were the silent age , the samaritan paradox and shadows of the vatican act 1 . 
  you can buy cigarettes at almost every grocery store or kiosk , but the government has recently increased the fee for the seller , so stores are limiting the checkout lines from which you can buy cigs . 
  the seller is n't allowed to display any tobacco products either . 
  supermarkets usually have [ these machines at the checkout ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/704944/landscape16_9/1024/576/b781bbd90b99a1c933124cf2110a0146/zm/1303429.jpg ) , you have to ask the clerk for the product 's number you want , push the button and it spits out the cigs . 
  a pack of cigarettes costs about 7 euros , but further tax increases have been planned . 
  menthol and other flavoured cigarettes will be banned by the year 2020 . edit : here in the eastern finland black market for russian cigs is alive and well . 
  most people know a guy ( who knows a guy etc. ), 
  who sells cigs for about half the price they cost in stores . 
  plenty of bunkers in the east , most famous one being the salpa defence line of bunkers , fortifications and trenches . 
  [ example photos . 
  ] ( http://retkipaikka.fi/vapaa/salpalinja-viimeinen-este/ ) there are also several bunker museums along the salpa line . 
  technically they are not called bunkers , but korsu instead . 
  in practice they served the same function , were mostly underground and were often made from steel and concrete , though wooden korsus are common too . 
  district heating from a power plant that burns woodchips and peat . 
  if it 's hot , i drink about a bottle ( 1,5 litre ) a day . 
  the minerals , especially kalium ( or i guess it 's potassium in english ) , help keeping your fluid balance in check . 
  [ star of africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afrikan_t%c3%a4hti ) is the first one that came to mind . 
  it 's been very popular for decades , not too complex so kids can play too and i think most finns have played it at some point in their lives . 
  you can also sell the berries tax free , unless you do berry picking for a living . 
  [ and use a device like this ] ( http://www.clasohlson.com/medias/sys_master/8873114927134.jpg ) . 
  in some ways it 's similar to finnish accent , spaniards ( mostly ! ), 
  pronounce the way words are written like finns do , at least when speaking english . 
  it 's phonetically simpler than native english speak , so easier to understand . 
  that 's my theory at least !, 
  spanish one is somehow super easy to understand , even when it 's really thick . 
  unlike thick italian or french accents . 
  i watch a lot of formula 1 and alonso and sainz are really easy to understand , while people like boullier and sometimes grosjean , or fisichella and davide valsecchi , are often difficult to understand . 
  i believe he is doing just fine . 
  i lost interest quickly too , but his other channel , beyond the press or something , occasionally has interesting videos so i stay subbed to that . 
  [ this map shows that there probably are n't boars in the stockholm region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/sus_scrofa_range_map.jpg/1920px-sus_scrofa_range_map.jpg ) . 
  strange , since finland and russia both have them more north than sweden . 
  not really hotness , just a mustard flavour and the texture is more paste-like , thicker . 
  felix has by far the most different flavours in finland , but there are some store brands and smaller companies making it too . 
  herkkumaa being the second biggest brand . 
  in finnish it 's called `` kurkkusalaatti '' , or `` sinappikurkkusalaatti '' ( a bit more mustardy , sinappi being mustard ), 
  no , it was about westerners travelling to countries in the mena region , kinda like this thread . 
  the original point of the thread was something else though , in one `` subthread '' it veered into tourism . 
  everyone agrees on the government 's conservative and religious backwardness . 
  but not getting into that , it is one of the safest countries in the region for visitiors . 
  recently in some thread , ca n't remember the sub , someone said that iran is a safe country to visit and they were downvoted to oblivion and got a lot of `` iran ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ?! '', 
  comments with upvotes all around . 
  propaganda spread by some countries does clearly work . 
  finnish governments travel advisory for iran says security situation is safe and there is no hostility towards foreign tourists . 
  low risk of terrorism and crimes agains foreigners are rare , but areas bordering iraq , pakistan and afghanistan should be avoided . 
  hbo nordic movie selection is a joke , there are like a couple dozens movies and most of those are stand up sets . 
  but the series selection is pretty great . 
  all hbo shows plus some from showtime , amc , fx , bbc , etc. 
  i rarely watch movies anymore anyway so this is perfect for me . 
  i cancelled netflix when they blocked the us , uk & canada vpn workarounds . 
  huh . 
  did n't know about that . 
  i only checked the irish embassy site in italy and they said a passport is needed for the irish , maybe it 's more lax the other way round . 
  did you go straight to ireland from the schengen area or via uk ? 
  because ireland and uk have a common travel area thingy with themselves , no passport checks . 
  kinda like a smaller schengen , or similar what the nordic countries had before schengen . 
  once you got to the uk with your passport , you did n't need it anymore because of both of them being in the eu stuff . 
  ireland is n't in schengen , so irish people need a passport to enter the schengen area . 
  you 're all good .

  i believe the problem is not only rising tuitions , but the fact that even bankruptcy does n't wipe student loan debt in the us . 
  i find this strange , you are not guaranteed a job after graduation but have to take huge financial risks to graduate , while almost all other kind of debt clears with bankruptcy . 
  yup , most of the costs of installing a toilet is from plumbing and connecting to the sewage system , the actual bowl is the cheapest part . 
  [ it 's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum , and i 'm all out of gum . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0gz4y9w6o0 ) could n't be more american . 
  one that 's not mentioned , americans are always chewing gum . 
  fun fact : finland 's most popular chewing gum brand is jenkki ( yank ( ee ) , meaning all americans not what it means in america ) . 
  yes , accessed from the bathroom , [ this gives you an idea ] ( http://www.blosius.fi/images/kylpyhuoneremontti_palin_0703_tuomarila-2.jpg ) . 
  even many single room/studio apartments nowadays have a sauna . 
  also most houses have the sauna inside , not as a seperate sauna building in the backyard , although those are not unusual either . 
  some apartment buildings in finland have a communal barbecue spot on the inner yard of the building . 
  and `` chinese '' : hui lai lee = one having a break, 
  here 's a good example of what makkaraperunat , or mp , or paskalaatikko ( shitbox ) etc. 
  technically that 's a british movie , according to imdb . 
  now i know why colbert used to say that `` oregon is the canada of california '' .
