  i 'm a finn but we share much of the `` jam culture '' of sweden . 
  preserves without crap-ton of extra sugar would be the choice , it 's the kind of jam perhaps most used here and american foods in general are considered too sugary for eurotastes anyway . 
  i see you are from oregon , and i hear oregon is somewhat known for its jams . 
  and everyone loves jam , swedes like to have it with crepes/pancakes/pl \u00e4ttar for example . 
  so some jam made of berries not readily available in swedish stores could be nice . 
  forget strawberry , raspberry etc. 
  that are common here , go for loganberry , huckleberry or marionberry instead . 
  something familiar but different . 
  i 've never been to a house/flat that had ac , but [ air source heat pumps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_source_heat_pumps ) are getting more common . 
  they are good in colder climates , because they can be used to heat a house/flat even in very cold temperatures and in the summer can be reversed to cool instead . 
  yes , the only nation-wide standardised exam , but it 's only for those who choose the so-called academic path after grade 9 , basically after grades 10-12 . 
  vocational school pupils do n't take this test . 
  the exams are held both in the spring and autumn , most take the test in the spring , but it 's good to have a second option . 
  you have to take at least four exams , and one of those has to be your native language ( finnish , swedish or sami ) exam , and another mandatory one is an advanced syllabus exam ; either second national language ( for most this is swedish ) , foreign language or maths . 
  the last two you can choose from a variety of subjects , including psychology , philosophy , history , physics , chemistry , biology , geography , religion and a few others . 
  you can choose as many exams as you want , but 4 is the minimum . 
  also noteworthy is that foreign language exams are in two parts , written exam and a listening comprehension exam . 
  you are graded differently in the final exams . 
  normally schools have 4-10 scale , the matriculation examination has : l - laudatur ( outstanding ) e - eximia cum laude approbatur ( excellent ) m - magna cum laude approbatur ( good ) c - cum laude approbatur ( satisfactory ) b - lubenter approbatur ( fair ) a - approbatur ( passable ) i - improbatur ( fail ) doing well on the exams help getting into universities , but it is n't absolutely mandatory to have good scores . 
  newspapers print the names of all who passed the exams and write stories about those few who were best of the best . 
  papers also compare schools based on their average test scores and publish the lists . 
  estonia 3 . 
  sweden 4 . 
  germany 5 . 
  china 6 . 
  japan 7 . 
  usa 9 . 
  norway 10 . 
  france the order varies based on the metrics , but the top three is clear . 
  no surprises really . 
  it 's in the top 10 in radio and number one in spotify . 
  hard not to hear it daily . 
  there is this aussie kids ' / teens ' tv show called h2o : just add water , which is brilliant in every way . 
  it has hot mermaids and shit . 
  the main characters of the last season were ** cle ** o , ** be ** lla and ri ** kki ** , so i forged my username as a tribute to the undisputed queen of summer daytime television . 
  i got a pair of [ `` winter crocs '' ] ( http://images.crocs.com/is/image/crocs/standard/isnpiv-black-and-black-mammoth-_10049_060_alt100.jpg ) for christmas from my bro , and i must admit they are very handy during the winter . 
  i smoke so have to go outside often , they are easy to slip on , warm and snow does n't ruin them as easily as regular slippers i use most months of the year . 
  a couple of times in canada people told me that they thought i was russian because of my accent . 
  which is strange , i do n't think finnish and russian accents are similar at all . 
  then again , many people think the hydraulic dude is russian too . 
  `` norway ? 
  is n't that the capital of sweden ? '', 
  depends on the job description . 
  if local languages are generally not required for doing the job , like it and similar , sure . 
  but that has been the case for years . 
  if the job requires interacting with people who do n't speak english , of course skills in local language ( s ) are needed most of the time . 
  private companies can do what they like , but for public services and government owned companies , the local languages skill requirement needs to remain . 
  it 's not . 
  english and swedish are mandatory . 
  many people take at least one additional language , usually german , russian or french . 
  spanish and italian are less common , and i believe mandarin is on the rise . 
  i wonder how the relatively harsh winters of v\u00e4sterbotten and high-speed rail work together . 
  none . 
  few i like to watch maybe biennially though are [ big night ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115678/reference ) , [ fight club ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/reference ) , and [ the fifth element ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/reference ) . 
  [ shaun of the dead ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/reference ) too . 
  shaun of the dead , one of my favourite movies of all time , never get bored of watching it . 
  then tried hot fuzz , it was ok but that 's it . 
  then checked the tv series spaced from the same folk , meh . 
  it would have to be either somewhere in new england or the pacific northwest , perhaps upstate ny too . 
  lets say oregon , but not portland area . 
  absolutely breathtaking nature , a blue state , not too crowded and mild climate . 
  minnesota was first that came to mind , probably the state which would make me the least homesick , but it 's too cold there . 
  if i ever leave finland , i 'd make sure it 's somewhere warmer . 
  i definitely would n't want to move anywhere south , way too hot there . 
  florida would maybe be my least favourite , with the humid hotness and hurricanes and stuff . 
  i live in what is called the finnish lakeland , and i must say every city and town here has way more water than needed for the size of the settlements . 
  [ the population of the larger cities range from only 35 000 \\ ( savonlinna \\ ) to around only 230 000 \\ ( tampere \\ ) ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@61.9772693,26.828108,8.13z?hl=en-gb ) . 
   estonia would be ok also but then we could not get the cheap booze from so close . 
  well , if we were the same country , latvian border would be much closer than the estonian border is now . 
  if upper peninsula of michigan was its own state , definitely that one , but the rest of the state is not too similar so i say minnesota too . 
  all teachers in finland have to have a master 's degree from a university , except kindergarten teachers need only bachelor 's . 
  pedagogy is not considered vocational . 
  and 1 . 
  stigma about higher vocational education ? 
  not at all . 
  but after comprehensive school ( at the end of junior high in the us maybe ? 
  9th grade ) students choose either the academic path of high school ( lukio ) or various vocational schools ( ammattikoulu ) , and there is a stereotype about vocational-schoolers , or `` amis ( laiset ) '' , and it 's not too flattering . 
  it 's been on since 2009 , eight seasons so far . 
  there is n't really any tradition in finland for graduating comprehensive school ( after 9th grade ) . 
  for those who choose the academic path instead of vocational schools , there are celebrations after graduating lukio , or high school ( usually after 12th grade ) . 
  [ penkkarit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penkkarit ) are held on february , after school 's done but before the matriculation exam later in the spring . 
  students dress up , like for a masquerade or cosplay party , and climb on the back of lorries they 've rented and decorated . 
  [ like this ] ( http://www.lansi-savo.fi/sites/default/files/images/news_item/14121943.jpg ) . 
  they are driven around town for a while , and the students throw candy to the onlookers . 
  sometimes they also visit an elementary school or other lower level schools and wreak havoc , since many are already drunk at this point . 
  after this they usually chill for the afternoon , eat out and gather strength for partying in bars , pubs and nightclubs til the wee hours . 
  edit : oh and they also buy a graduation hat , [ like this one ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/15/ea/37/15ea371689b1cade540e48f95dff1c61.jpg ) , but 's that only after they have passed the exam . 
  we are generally considered more jovial , talkative and sometimes more musical than the rest of the country . 
  my personal experiences tend to agree with the stereotype . 
  the culture has somewhat more influences from the east , russia and karelia , than other parts of finland . 
  eurosport too , but i do n't think op was after sports channels . 
  here we have peanut butter and nutella right next to each other . 
  only the biggest super/hypermarkets have more than one brand though . 
  i started watching and thought what are you on about , it 's perfectly comprehensible . 
  then it slowly became almost complete gibberish . 
  there 's [ an asterix album in the rauma dialect ] ( http://www.lukuhetki.fi/murre-asterix-4-asteriksim-boikkane-mukul/3893 ) btw . 
  so our `` linnuntie '' , bird 's way/road , is a calque from swedish . 
  this is the earliest one i could find latenight googling : http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/1920/c5d3fe054e9a4d1e98d2915b6d70115d.jpg might as well give the source too , it 's a tabloid but sometimes they do make interesting articles . 
  i started with [ these cursive ones ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/468/0fa5d928619b436d867a81307a5285d7.jpg ) in the late 80s , my first year in school . 
  the next year they changed it to [ this one ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/628/a93c32e08dae4768869a4bda9f183aeb.jpg ) , which was a bit confusing .
