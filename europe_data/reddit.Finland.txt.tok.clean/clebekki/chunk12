  the new cursive was simpler , but for someone just learning to write the change was ... confusing . 
  i think nowadays they prefer [ something like this ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/628/46827e3320294f89b12a933830ecda7c.jpg ) as a guideline , but it 's not `` enforced '' that everyone writes the same way . 
  more emphasis on keyboard skills and such . 
  then you turn the tv on channel 1 to watch the public broadcasting company 's election coverage and wait for their prediction . 
  depending on that you either go to bed or have a few more beers . 
  off the top of my head i remember [ the sauna elf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sauna#traditions_and_old_beliefs ) . 
  not scary or creepy really , but i was told by my parents that if i act improperly in the sauna , the sauna elf will come at night and tickle me awake until i 've learned my lesson . 
  also sometimes after my parents threw water on the hot stones ( l\u00f6yly ) they said `` there the sauna elf was again , did you see it flash behind the stones ?! '', 
  and i was always miffed i did n't see it , but behaved in fear of the horrible punishment . 
  not every monday at noon , only the first monday of every month . 
  hbo nordic . 
  used to subscribe to netflix for a couple of years , stopped when they started blocking vpns . 
  of course not , i ask my butler to do it . 
  2016 market shares in finland : android 67 % , iphone 20 % , windows phone 13 % . 
  no need to even smuggle dongles . 
  there was a case in finland in the late ' 00s where members of a gang set up a wireless access point somewhere near the prison and their prison buddies used that to go online with their xbox360s . 
  but the online capable consoles have been banned for nearly 10 years now . 
  and in ipa : [ me\u02d0mi ], 
  even if they could n't nuke south korea , they have built a fuckton of artillery , rocket launchers and ammunition for them . 
  seoul is within range of said artillery/rocket strikes and a full-on strike would be devastating . 
  then there are the possible chemical weapons . 
  or probable , if they can build nukes , they can make chemical weapons . 
  the same situation with finnish yle . 
  at least they still have the olympics . 
  til i can speak norrland swedish fluently . 
  as long as nothing happened to anna , i 'm fine with every conclusion . 
  do n't want to google it either , just keep the memories . 
  i really liked the little vampire ( der kleine vampir ) books by angela sommer-bodenburg , found the first one at a library just after i learned to read in the late 80s . 
  i also loved the illustration by amelie glienke . 
  by mid nineties i kind of grew out of it and never finished the series . 
  i think the whole coast of bosnia & herzegovina is grand . 
  the `` cassette levy '' was ridiculous , but we got rid of it in 2015 , still much too late . 
  10 + years ago we always group ordered blank dvds from germany , you got 100 discs in germany for the same price you would have gotten 10 discs in finland . 
  chile or argentina would be my first choice . 
  botswana if i had to go to africa , and vietnam in sea . 
  i live in a new town , founded officially in 1848 by emperor nicholas i of russia . 
  there was a village there before , and some late bronze age/early iron age settlements have been dug up a few kilometres from my flat , by the river . 
  just having the bants , enjoy your trip !, 
   it 's too far away ...  we 're american what 's going on here , normally you yanks go on about how everything in europe is within walking distance compared to the us !, 
  my relationship to guns is that i do n't own one , i do n't need one and i do n't want one , but i know how to use them if i need to . 
  my father has a few shotguns and rifles , for hunting , and i did shoot with one of each when i was a kid . 
  supervised of course . 
  our neighbour preferred handguns , so i shot a few .22 s and 9mms too , which were a lot less scary for a kid than rifles or shotguns . 
  my own main gun was an air gun , it was a fun hobby . 
  and during conscription i shot all kinds of stuff , an assault rifle , a machine gun , bazookas . 
  it was ok , now i know how to use them if needed . 
  blue cross flag . 
  i 'd say it 's somewhat popular in cable/satellite households . 
  they often air the same , usually winter sport , events as the public broadcasting company , it 's just which commentators one prefers . 
  the ads on eurosport can get annoying , since they rotate the same few online gambling ads all the time , and most of them are in swedish . 
  the obvious one is sweden , ice hockey and floorball especially . 
  we also have a yearly [ athletics competition just between sweden and finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland-sweden_athletics_international ) . 
  100/10 unlimited internet + cable/iptv hybrid box with 2500 hours of space for recordings , 40 $ / mo. 
  speed is as advertised and the connection is reliable . 
  not popular at all . 
  there are 17 active rugby clubs with 26 teams in finland . 
  american football is much more popular , and even that is a niche sport here . 
  do n't see rugby becoming more popular anytime soon . 
  [ kekkonen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjt-aejkzf0 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen, 
  milk . 
  however i eat too much kebabs and pizza and even mickey d 's sometimes , and then the choice is diet coke . 
  many europeans do n't like what the us government does all around the world , but there 's no hatred towards regular americans and certainly no danger . 
  that 's just under 10 $ per m \u00b2 , you could say that 's cheap . 
  i live in a similar size town in finland , but 7km from the center and i pay about the same ( 410 $ for 43m \u00b2 ) . 
  in the center it 'd be easily 15 $ per m \u00b2 . 
  i got my first puukko when i started first grade , but i had practiced with my dad 's and grandad 's puukkos even earlier . 
  quite common in ( semi - ) rural finland . 
  finland does n't have dorms like colleges in the us for example . 
  instead every city has a firm or two that rents student apartments , universities or polytechnics have nothing to do with them . 
  there are studio apartments for students , shared apartments ( 2-5 students live in the same apartment , each have their own room and share the kitchen/living area and bathroom ( s ) ) , and family apartments with two to three rooms . 
  usually water and electricity is included in the rent and the housing is generally quite a bit more affordable than normal rental apartments . 
  it 's quite popular also for a group of friends to rent a 3-5 room apartment from the non-student market . 
  edit : this video shows a normal shared apartment for three students and later a family student apartment : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhvm2zrzirc, 
  i speak finnish but have to say my favourite is basque because all the mystery and unknowns about it . 
  in both of you drawings you drive from estonia to russia , around lake ladoga to northern finland . 
  that 's not a viable route , either because of lack of proper roads and/or border crossing stations . 
  either with a ferry from tallinn to helsinki , or a short land route from estonia to st. petersburg to south-eastern finland are more viable options . 
  mazda 3 sedan . 
  hey now , m\u00e4titahna / sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar is delicious too !, 
  never tried it with new potatoes though . 
  early harvest potatoes , i believe . 
  delicious with butter or pickled herring . 
  central/eastern finland , it 's -3 c ( 27f ) , there 's about 40cm ( 1 ' 4 '' ) of snow on the ground , it 's cloudy . 
  that amount of snow is pretty standard here for this time of year , temperatures are a bit on the warmer side . 
  but it really varies , in february it can be anything from around the freezing point to over -30 c. 
  typically it 's between -5 and -20 c ( ~ 25 to -5 f ) , but a week long cold snap of -20 to -30 c ( ~ -5 to -20 f ) is totally normal . 
  technically three , russia is a european country too . 
  but in this context it 's more practical to think russia as its own entity . 
  on a related note , irc is still used and if you stretch the definition could be called social media . 
  ircnet is a mostly european network and one of the biggest ones . 
  then there 's euirc and some other small/tiny ones . 
  not what op was looking for probably , but irc is great , i use it more than facebook , whatsapp and twitter combined . 
  five first things that come to mind : * adam malysz . 
  epic skijumper and epic moustache . 
  * / r/polandball of course * that eurovision song contest performance where the lovely ladies churned butter . 
  * polish style sausages , very tasty . 
  * poles love metal music . 
  edit : honorary mention , robert kubica would 've been a wdc one day ... a real shame . 
  i used to have a -91 opel kadett way back in the day , turned me off opels for the rest of my life that 's for sure . 
  me neither .
