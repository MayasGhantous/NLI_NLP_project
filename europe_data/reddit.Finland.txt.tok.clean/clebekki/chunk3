  in finnish norja . 
  which also means supple , willowy , loose-jointed . 
  pretty weird . 
  to think about it , it 's pretty easy to spot estonians too , no matter what the language . 
  at first i always think `` is that a finn ? '', 
  but after a couple of sentences you clearly notice the few differences in pronunciation and it 's clear they are estonian . 
  funnily sometimes this happens when some icelanders are speaking english , although the language is not even related to finnish . 
  but it 's much faster and easier to notice they are not finnish speakers . 
  these would be the team 's football shoes : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rutwbd30_64/tbxatlzxfpi/aaaaaaaaabu/x03hoxxdubc/s1600/reinot_87565b.jpg reino is a finnish first name and also the brand name of those slippers . 
  til ctrl + f works in steam client . 
  never really had any use for that there . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ni8pey0.png now i know what civ to take and what victory to go after next . 
  edit : damnit , kylenr found it faster , civ v has tons of achievements . 
  first rule of po ... israelbox is you do not talk about israelbox . 
  ^ do n't ^ leave ^ a ^ hummock ^ without ^ lichen , ^ or ^ you ^ only ^ leave ^ hardship ^ for ^ these ^ antlered ^ beings . 
  an educational poem i made up in the dead of night . 
  lichen actually . 
  except that finnish example has nothing to do with tone and the thai example is all about tone . 
  the kokko-story means the same whether you say it monotonically or with theater style enthuistic intonation . 
  both are agglutinative languages and both have vowel harmony . 
  just that makes them somewhat similar , but in my general linguistics studies at uni i did n't even once come across a suggestion that they are related . 
  different languages can have very similar morphological structures , yet be in no way related . 
  if the penis & ballsack combo of sweden & finland was mirrored , it 'd look like we were pissing on moscow . 
  it 's 3 am and i 'm drunk , have to go pee . 
  i was suprised by how much lowland there is in northern italy . 
  i 'm sensing a civil war already , south vs north . 
  as with the us , the north would crush you !, 
  and free all your ... tulip farmers ? 
  prost !, 
  the netherlands could be our hawaii . 
  or maybe that 's iceland . 
  well , then it could be our puerto rico . 
  we have some extra too . 
  the elk hunting season is just about to start and our highways become elk slalom tracks . 
  danish hockey fans will probably remember that forever . 
  and keep reminding us . 
  i do n't mind , i was actually very happy for you guys !, 
  the scottish highlands are barren , because there can be only one . 
  no worries , i just put it there so everyone can `` appreciate '' my lame joke . 
  the company ( reima oy ) which make the packs for the government also sell them directly to people . 
  it apparently costs 274.15 euros , and as a company it probably makes some profit off of it , so the value of the box is probably somewhere between 200 and 270 euros . 
  yeah and i 've met both of them . 
  a joke . 
  bad one , but a joke nonetheless . 
  edit : i responded to him/her saying something in the lines of `` there are americans who do n't sleep holding a bible in one hand and a gun in the other '' s/he edited that out . 
  also , news events that happen outside the usa and do n't directly have something to with the us are covered less in the states than in europe . 
  i have no data or evidence for this , just personal observations . 
  what ... seems needlesly complicated ? 
  do n't know about drugs . 
  ** tobacco ** in finland . 
  you ca n't smoke anywhere anymore , to exaggerate a little . 
  tobacco tax is high , a pack of 18-20 cigarettes i think is at minimum 4 $ . 
  tobacco products can not be shown in stores . 
  there are tobacco machines at cashier lines , they only show a number , [ like this . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xwdvuta.jpg ) you have to ask the cashier which number is for which brand and pack size . 
  age limit is 18 . 
  expensive . 
  beer from ~ 1 $ per 0,33 l can/bottle . 
  wine from 6 $ per 0,75 l bottle , liquor from 10 $ 0,5 l bottle . 
  anything over 4,7 % is sold only in government monopoly , alko , stores . 
  milder ones can be sold at pretty much any store or kiosk . 
  age limit is 18 for up to 22 % alcohol , above that it 's 20 , but can be sold in bars , pubs and the such for 18-year-olds . 
  drunk driving limit is 0,05 % , 0,12 % aggravated . 
  punisments are pretty severe , from a hefty fine ( and it 's based on your income . 
  the more you earn the more you pay ) to prison for up to 2 years , and of course driving license is suspended for at least a month . 
  estonia of selling cheap liqour to finlans , but can not into nordic . 
  : o in finland the cheapest beer is over 20 $ a case . 
  4,5 % , 24 pack , 0,33 l cans . 
  that 's almost a euro per can ffs . 
  if you want anything else than the bulk and bland finnish lagers , you must be prepared to pay at least about ~ 2,5 $ per bottle/can . 
  finns think very highly of germany and germans . 
  there is the fact that in the 40s they destroyed finnish lapland , but then again , the nazis practically saved us from being annexed to the soviet union . 
  but that 's the past . 
  today , like the nordic countries , one of the most respected countries in europe/world , if you ask almost any finn . 
  at least in the netherlands and finland they round prices to the nearest .05 euro . 
  but if you pay with plastic the total sum is n't rounded . 
  for example i just look at a receipt , i paid by debit card and the sum was 20.38 , but if i had paid with cash i would 've paid 20.40 . 
  however , individual item prices are still way more often priced in the form x.y9 ( 1.99 , 1.69 , 2.49 etc ) than x.y5 . 
  he was most likely rich , some of them have spent over 10 000 euros to get here , get taxis from tornio to turku ( 700 + kilometres , 1000 + euro trip ) , and all that . 
  he was not a refugee in desperation , he was shopping for a new place to live with no real worries . 
  it 's actually unusually warm this autumn . 
  last year we had about 10cm of snow for a while at this time , today it was 18 degrees and sunny ( in eastern finland at least ) . 
  i made a small snowman to look for any illegal immigrants on 22.9.2014 : http://imgur.com/v94ahgj, 
  sorry i took long to answer , was in a hospital for almost three weeks . 
  yeah , insects , we mostly have mosquitoes . 
  the more north you go , the more you have them . 
  lapland during summer is insanity . 
  wasps and horse-flies can be a bitch too , but other than that it 's all good . 
  canada was a breeze to get into . 
  but i 'm a white northern european male who had a return ticket . 
  the cameroonians on the plane did n't have it as easy though . 
  that particular area is not called anything , it shows parts of savonia and finnish karelia . 
  it is a part of a larger area unofficially called as j\u00e4rvi-suomi , literally lake-finland . 
  for there are a lot of lakes in that part of the country . 
  the lakes and forests are really our main speciality . 
  when i look at central europe or the uk on a map , the lack of lakes is really striking . 
  this pic is a comparison of the lake district in england and part of the `` lake district '' in finland , at the same scale . 
  it 's kinda lakey for the uk , but ... http://i.imgur.com/jrbiqpz.jpg, 
  raw herring and salmiak , count me in !, 
  i think most people have been seeing tsipras 's face enough on the news lately , maybe better to leave it out .
