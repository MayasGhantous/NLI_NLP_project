  sounds very finnish too . 
  and while i think it 's an old name , it does n't have that `` old people name '' feel to it . 
  worst might be ** jorma ** . 
  it was a very popular name for baby boomers after ww2 , but at some point it also took the meaning penis ( like dick ) and is not at all popular anymore . 
  or ** yrj\u00f6 ** , from greek ge\u00f4rgios . 
  it 's also a slang word for vomit . 
  a female name ** impi ** ( virgin ) is not one of my favourites either . 
  best ... 
  i like men 's names like ** taisto ** ( from taistelu , = fight , battle ) , ** aarre ** ( treasure ) , ** otso ** ( bear ) and ** vesa ** ( seedling , sapling ) . 
  and women 's ; ** aamu ** ( morning ) , ** lumi ** ( snow ) and ** meri ** ( sea ) . 
  meri-tuuli is also somewhat common , it means sea wind , but that 's a bit too much . 
   it was mostly a joke though and alot of norwegians got pissed about it being set up like a charity event . . 
  the whole butter crisis situation was hilarious though , how can you not make fun of it haha . 
  one of the richest countries having to rely on donations and smuggled contraband butter ... 
  i mean , rotfl !, 
  cheap food is unhealthy food . 
  of course you can get inexpensive healthy food too , but ingredients for healthier foods are much less available in poor neighbourhoods than in wealthier areas . 
  convenient , cheap fast food is horribly unhealthy and many areas in the us have almost no alternatives to it . 
  saturated fats are considered more bad for you than unsaturated fats . 
  edit : since i got downvoted , here 's a source for my claim : http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good, 
  easy , just park your boat on the path where the cable would be laid . 
  i would n't go so far as to say simple , but it certainly is more `` logical '' and regular than english or french . 
  there are other maybe surprising similarities between turkish and hungarian , and finnish too , although they are not in the same language family . 
  all have vowel harmony and all are agglutinative languages ( basically meaning adding shit at the end of words instead of using seperate words like prepositions ( in , at , on etc. ), 
  in english ) , and no grammatical gender . 
  all those bloody non-euros coming here and taking our karma and refusing to assimilate or follow the rules of a civilized subreddit . 
  i 'm so angry now , grrr . 
  the germanwings people said in the first press event that the plane had the latest software . 
  [ in finnish ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lws3c5l.png ) why is australia in eurovision song contest why is australia participating in esc why does australia have marsupials why does australia have a unique biota why does northern australia have rainforests, 
  everything in america is much sweeter than here . 
  even their regular white bread is yucky sweet , i do n't get it . 
  2004 honda accord sure as hell is n't upper middle class in finland either . 
  also the other one is a company car . 
  residential electric saunas are often giving about 80c ( + -10 c ) at max power . 
  a proper wood heated sauna goes to 100c without even trying , and a really proper smoke sauna , sky 's the limit . 
  yes , it 's snus in the last pic . 
  you ca n't sell snus in finland , but lots of people use it here . 
  sweden is just next door , you go there and buy shitloads of it . 
  it 's , or at least was , sold in the border shops in russia too , so eastern finns are sorted too . 
  umm , in springtime , when all the snow is melting and grit dust is all over the place , you need to drive two blocks and your car looks like that . 
  certain parts of the americas have massive drug related crime and other problems . 
  there are cartels that have bigger armed forces than some states . 
  they said that they 've lived and worked in europe for fifteen years . 
  i do n't think they 're a total foreigner to a european cultural or sociopolitical climate . 
  low crime rates , it 's a really safe country like other nordic countries . 
  most crime is committed under the influence of alcohol and between people who know each other . 
  the risk of ( physically ) being a victim of a stranger is very low . 
  i 'd say most finns are pissed off about cutting the police budget , people here generally trust the police and do n't want fewer of them , especially with the 35k newcomers from middle east . 
  but the government is cutting everything , so for example the cuts made to education gets more media coverage and makes people more loud/angry . 
  now think about the population density of finland . 
  there are so many people living in areas where the police might get to in a few hours or maybe the next day , if they are not busy . 
  also small towns with maybe four police officers max . 
  and where do they mostly put up these immigration centers ? 
  remote areas of small finnish towns . 
  it 's not going to be pretty . 
  i do n't follow the finnish media that closely , but i do n't think estonia is a news topic anymore . 
  it was a couple years ago , because of the 20th anniversary , but not in a controversial way . 
  i remember that many years ago jutta rabe was in the media a lot , and mostly got negative coverage . 
  i do n't know enough of her or her work to have an opinion . 
  too soon , bruh . 
  i live in eastern finland . 
  it 's all trees , road signs and the occasional drunkard leaning on either of those . 
  or lakes . 
  at least in the south/west you sometimes see a field . 
  not here . 
  and finnish . 
  really . 
  actually you can also kinda use [ a rod with a reel ] ( http://static3.motonet.fi/img/5/542440/500/542440.jpg ) , but only when icefishing . 
  the only exceptions are rapids or streams which migratory fish use , no fishing there . 
  well , how ya doin ' , beautiful ? 
   your country has a million or so more inhabitants it 's the other way round , finland has ~ million more people than ireland . 
  unless you count northern ireland too . 
  there are differences in finland too . 
  people here in the east ( finnish karelia and maybe savonia ) are more chatty than in the rest of the country , generally speaking . 
  and i kinda ... like it . 
  ^ ^ please ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ take ^ ^ away ^ ^ my ^ ^ citizenship ^ ^ for ^ ^ saying ^ ^ this ... 
  the snow looks nice , but in reality it messed up the public transport system pretty bad . 
  many buses , trams and trains were either cancelled , very late or stuck in snow . 
  it was no picnic with cars either . 
  the pic was taken a couple of days ago during a snowstorm in southern finland . 
  at [ 30 secs ] ( https://youtu.be/ope9qnzxmp8?t=31s ) i thought the assailant in pink hits her fellow soldier , but looking at it again the little guy was supplying the cop with ammunition . 
  interestingly that guy also hit the cop at the beginning of the conflict . 
  war is chaotic , man . 
  it was +6 just before christmas with no snow , very unusually warm , and now it 's -24 and getting colder . 
  also got a few millimetres of snow last night , but usually we have close to half a metre by now . 
  triple-glazed windows and proper ( district ) heating and it 's a comfy 21,6 degrees in my apartment . 
  and outside you just need proper clothing , wear many layers and it 's not that bad . 
  but having a car is a pain , and my renault 's heater is n't very good at all . 
  -20 here in eastern finland now . 
  pretty normal for january , but there 's still ~ ~ no snow ~ ~ only about a centimetre of snow , which is very unusual . 
  the mods there are elitist idiots , who want to keep the subreddit `` pure '' or some other nonsense . 
  -08 too , if i remember correctly . 
  that christmas when i drove to my parents ' place in southern finland it was -28 degrees ( in eastern finland ) . 
  this xmas it was 6 . 
  midsummer is maybe the biggest celebration of the year in finland . 
  it 's that or christmas . 
  cities are deserted because everyone goes to the lake - and seashores to drink and drown and other fun stuff . 
  long gone are winters when you skated along frozen canals and rivers . 
  well , not gone , but getting more rare all the time . 
  i 'm more fond of smaller cities than warsow or krakow , but not knowing the language the bigger cities are more attractive for a newbie tourist like me .
