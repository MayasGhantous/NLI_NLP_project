  i 'm planning a trip to poland next summer , first thought is always warsow but krak\u00f3w is an option . 
  if the airport is no fuzz and it 's easy to get to downtown from there , it 's even more tempting . 
  i could also pop out of polan to go say hello to the czechs and maybe slovaks too since they 're nearby . 
  that just adds insult to injury . 
  anna is a common name in finland , and it also rhymes with `` panna '' , which means to fuck . 
  and `` anna '' also means `` let '' . 
  so `` anna anna , anna mun sua panna '' means `` anna anna , let me fuck you '' . 
  no need to add shit to this shit . 
  this is the worst time of the year here . 
  it 's getting cold , freezing , and there are only a couple of hours of daylight . 
  the darkness is worst now because there is no snow in most parts of the country . 
  when the snow comes , it 's much more bearable and does n't feel so dark . 
  * in arabic . 
  not trying to be a douche , easy mistake to make and everyone understood what you meant anyway . 
  fun fact , `` perse '' means `` ass/arse '' in finnish . 
  so persepolis is arse-city . 
  that must be especially true for the us , because american tv and movies are so popular everywhere in the west . 
  based on all the sitcoms etc. 
  everyone in the us is either rich or at least upper middle class . 
  in reality it 's more like breaking bad , 
   we only do bloodsausages blood pancakes too !, 
  now there 's something that really is an acquired taste . 
  [ indigenous sami people .

  english grammar is far from simple . 
  i have a book called a student 's grammar of the english language that i used when i studied english at uni . 
  it 's ~ 500 pages . 
  and it 's just a shorter version of a comprehensive grammar of the english language ( edit : that 's about 1800 pages ) . 
  it 's all relative . 
  the rules allow some minor editing like cropping , noise reduction , toning and brightness adjustment etc. 
  but you ca n't remove ( or add ) anything except possible lense dust . 
  i do n't know how much this is edited , or if it 's edited at all . 
  the rules , in finnish only , sorry : http://www.vuodenluontokuva.fi/vlk/saannot2015 edit : google translate did a surprisingly good job with that : https://translate.google.fi/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vuodenluontokuva.fi%2fvlk%2fsaannot2015&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url, 
  they do n't mind the human head , or other places , either , although their finnish name is literally `` moose fly '' . 
  those motherfuckers are a real pain in the arse . 
  the translation is correct , but it 's not about protesting , it 's about celebrating . 
  although this [ infamous `` torilla tavaltaan '' ] ( http://www.nesretro.com/yabbfiles/attachments/1333751676529597.jpeg ) - photo can be interpreted as both a protest and a celebration . 
  no , from scientific studies and doctors . 
  i have crohn 's disease so i have to be very careful what to eat . 
  no-one has claimed italian desserts are healthy !, 
  forget about the desserts , i 'm getting hungry . 
  they probably are n't . 
  every cuisine has lots of unhealthy stuff , but overall and compared to most other cuisines italian food is healthy . 
  the amazing thing is that the italian cuisine is one of the healthiest in the world too . 
  delicious and healthy , simply great . 
  they must all be like / u/itwashere , love the cold and hate the heat . 
  plenty of the former and very little of the latter here . 
  i had an aussie professor in uni , he hated cold but loved beer , so he must be the exception to the rule . 
  he did n't own a pub though . 
  seems like it 's unusually cold for this time of year in europe , and unusually warm in north america . 
  been -10 in finland for days , not very common for early november . 
  same in finland , but a common exception is nature documentaries , often the original narrator is replaced by a finnish one . 
  parts where someone is actually seen speaking on screen are subtitled as usual . 
  not dubbing really , and i kind of like it , you can 100 % concentrate on watching the beauty of nature . 
  in finland you can get the bulkiest of bulk lagers ( ~ 4,5-4 ,7 abv ) for about 6 $ a sixpack . 
  anything other than that would be 9-12 $ . 
  fancy craft beers are about 3-6 $ per bottle . 
  i 'm using the anglosphere definition of scandinavia here , so nordic . 
  we can help a bit about the winter warfare thing , call us . 
  edit : since i 'd rather have the eu army come here to train winter combat and all that it involves than the [ bloody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axiszlqp12u ) [ yanks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l67mnbplfmy ) ... 
   2 ) a ticket for 20 over only costs a little bit of money . 
  in finland the fine for speeding is proportional to your income . 
  some rich bastards have been fined over 100 000 $ . 
  in individual sports it could still happen , the us has many times won gold , silver and bronze in a single event . 
  with team sports it 's of course different . 
  i agree . 
  just saying it 's not just this subreddit as / u/onetruewaaq said , it 's a bigger thing `` irl '' too . 
  objectivity is often forgotten when two camps measure their dicks . 
  i think he is talking about the west with `` while you guys doing it , its fine '' . 
  saudi arabia 38 % favourable . 
  wow . 
  you can with some mobile apps , like reddit is fun . 
  on a related note , every medium-sized or larger bridge in finland has been designed with easy detonation in mind , so there are holes and structures that military engineers can use to quickly and efficiently blow up a bridge . 
  that 's if the new greater finland plan does n't work and we have to run to sweden . 
  in lutheranism nothing is cheerful , not even weddings . 
  i checked the availability of moldovan wines at our government alcohol monopoly chain alko , only two wines : - ch\u00e2teau vartely sauvignon blanc 2013 - 0,75 l 11,19 $ - eno cabernet sauvignon 2013 - 0,75 l 9,41 $ i hate how expensive alcohol is here , and because of prices and the government monopoly , selection is quite poor too . 
  no scientific study includes all people , surely you must know that ? 
  based on your comment i 'm not really sure . 
  just look at the phonetics of the languages , compare how those apply when pronouncing a different language and the similarities are striking . 
  your personal feelings or experiences do n't change facts . 
  you 've met plenty of both and made a phonetic analysis on this small sample ? 
  good for you . 
  finnish and icelandic accents of english are almost identical . 
  definitely not taken at 2am . 
  and if it really was , definitely not in naantali . 
  http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/finland/turku it would be nautical twilight , you would only see some glimmer of lightness near the horizon in the sun 's direction . 
  some of them look like snowflakes made of planes . 
  probably triggered him further by mentioning jebus . 
  i could 've chosen kinder and more eloquent words , but i judged they were n't up for reasoning . 
  we have ikea and lidl , would n't mind having kfc . 
  i got addicted to that shit in canada , it 's disgustingly good . 
  toonie tuesdays are why my arteries are probably still clogged with all kinds of stuff . 
   serve as anti-semitism jesus , stop waving the anti-semitism card at everything . 
  edit : they deleted their comment , basically they were saying what / u/hematophagian said serves as antisemitism , if it was n't clear from my short snippet . 
  kiri means actually `` spurt '' . 
  it 's also strange , though kind of appropriate , that the book talks about `` kasutamine '' all the time . 
  `` kaasuttaminen '' means `` to gas/to press the accelerator pedal '' , but why would i need to do that to adjust the a/c ? 
  raamattu is bible in finnish , so it 's a hand-bible . 
  driving my mazda 3 is delightful , but i would n't call it a religious experience . 
  you seem to be good at finnish and estonian .
