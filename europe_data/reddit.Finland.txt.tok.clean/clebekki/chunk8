  not really worth the time and effort it takes . 
  also a multiple visit visa costs a couple of hundred euros a year . 
  it was -32 here on friday at midnight , now it 's -3 . 
  ~ 30 degree shift in under 48 hours . 
  is that prague ? 
  the snow makes the elevation differences more pronounced , or maybe it 's just the angle of the photo . 
  started to investigate the geography of eastern turkey and found out there 's a city called batman . 
  just south of the mountain region though , so a hot place . 
  also the baltics are one of the few that call finland similar to what finns do . 
  suomi , soome , somija , suomija , from north to south . 
  happy cake day !, 
  i like france and french people , they are tenacious and orgulous for a reason . 
  they were a major part in making europe the secular haven it still is , that alone is a thing to applaud . 
  silly stereotypes learnt early from anglosphere children 's tv/books do n't mean much . 
  this map i made a while ago shows population split in three regions , fits with the homicide map pretty well . 
  that 's what i thought too . 
  they claim the attack now that news has come that the terrorist is still on the run - maybe trying to make the situation look scarier by putting their name on it . 
  apparently isis has claimed the berlin attack : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38385961, 
  north or east . 
  oulu is on the coast so has milder weather than joensuu for example , although oulu is much more north . 
  eastern finland every now and then gets the supercold or - hot fronts from siberia too . 
  i only get glonass and gps signals , but is n't galileo supposed to go live on thursday so does n't yet work on consumer devices ? 
  if i recall correctly the eu was working on legislation to require mobile phones sold in the eu to have galileo support . 
  no idea what 's been happening with that though . 
  for android try `` gps satellites viewer '' by s.f. 
  applicality ltd. 
  heard about this on bbc world news on telly . 
  a politician and two journalists killed , around restaurant closing hours on saturday , everyone knows there 's always at least one police patrol near at that time . 
  also the suspect stayed on the scene to surrender , and was sober . 
  does n't sound like the `` usual '' homicide in finland at all . 
  sounds very similar to how it 's done in finland too . 
  i once had to wait a minute or so to get to a booth , but i was the only one in the so-called queue . 
  at the time i was also living in the city centre , a district with the most voters , and the polling station was the town hall . 
  yup , it would kind of make sense to go with gripen . 
  but then again i 'm just a layman . 
  finland is considering the gripen as a replacement for hornets , it would be a pretty good deal , with r & d and manufacturing partnerships included . 
  but somehow i think the yanks will get the deal with their f-35 . 
  norway and denmark already went that way too . 
  i did some research and apparently it has something to do with bombs . 
  the one with only one filling `` was like an atomic bomb '' , the one with both fillings was even more powerful , like a hydraulic bomb . 
  interesting . 
  i always forget which is which , and i even googled to be sure . 
  fixed . 
  it hit our cheese industry pretty hard too . 
  on the other hand , we got super cheap cheese for a little while when they sold the cheese meant for russian market here in finland . 
  atomi ( atom ) has ham and egg , vety ( hydrogen ) has either ham or egg . 
  it 's a lappeenranta thing , though it has spread to some neighbouring areas too . 
  it 's a good choice for finland , but [ this one from the same painter ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/gallen_kallela_the_aino_triptych.jpg/1920px-gallen_kallela_the_aino_triptych.jpg ) , akseli gallen-kallela , is more famous in finland . 
  because kalevala and stuff . 
  they could make landfall in romania , follow the non-mountainous area around danube through hungary and ... yeah , vienna would be the final choke point , but serbia and romania would stop them earlier . 
  it 's been a while since my german lessons in school , but does n't it say something like `` post a picture of your kids and the whole world sees it '' , not just all your friends ? 
  i thought it did n't look like a roll in the picture . 
  here a kebab roll , `` rullakebab '' , is basically pizza dough rolled with kebab meat , salad , sauces and maybe some cheese inside . 
  those are usually pretty big , while pita kebabs are more of a snack . 
  oh , kebab rolls are popular here too . 
  i know kebab pita , but what 's kebab bulka ? 
  even better , more time for the beer to get cold , because systembolagets are few and far between . 
  no but yeah , stronger beers and wines should be in the milk stores , the monopoly can keep their vodkas . 
  the area of finland increases about 7 square kilometres per year and we do n't have to do anything . 
  the dutch will lose this battle no matter how hard they try to reclaim land !, 
  the only reason i have small amounts of uht around , as emergency milk to go with coffee if i 'm out of fresh . 
  i remember that f2 tornado of 2004 , it happened just 15km from where i live , just north of a 75k population town . 
  it had a ~ ~ 10km ~ ~ almost 20km track , mostly over lakes and uninhabited islands fortunately . 
  made me wonder what would have happened if it had appeared just a little bit to the south . 
  yet !, 
  the valley is close to the sierra nevada mountains . 
  in the us , a valley near their sierra nevada mountains is called death valley , hottest place on earth . 
  ominous . 
  when i visited canada it was super weird that there were no bike paths or lanes anywhere , i assume it 's the same in the us . 
  [ this is what a typical finnish suburb looks like ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@62.6187234,29.8189239,3a,75y,111.28h,77.38t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1syrrh8cjjnovixhhw_fd2ng!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dyrrh8cjjnovixhhw_fd2ng%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d99.33894%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-gb ) . 
  there 's a seperate bike path at least on one side of every road or street in urban areas , often on both sides . 
  then there 's a bike/pedestrian network of paths , in google maps shown as dotted grey lines . 
  in finnish to be drunk is `` nakit silmill\u00e4 '' , to have frankfurters on your eyes . 
  maybe whoever made this infographic mistook a frankfurter for a stick , an eye for an ear , and finnish for danish . 
  or was drunk . 
  with a tent you have the ability to choose to put it up so it 's in shade in the morning . 
  with a block of flats it 's not so easy . 
  yes 24 is cool enough to fall asleep no problem , and a tower fan with sleep mode helps too . 
  the problem is that the night here is about 4 hours long and the sun starts shining so early and it warms the place back up early in the morning . 
  eastern tip of m\u00f8n ? 
  same in finland . 
  my top floor apartment has been 27 degrees for a couple of weeks now , and the temperatures outside have n't even reached 25 yet this summer . 
  because of pollen i only ventilate in the evenings , i usually get the temps down to a bearable ~ 24 for the nights . 
  it 's still miserable . 
  [ yup , maybe a degree or at most two colder ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rntw6hq.gif ) . 
  [ population density ] ( http://mikkokangasoja.puheenvuoro.uusisuomi.fi/sites/default/files/domain-654/kuvat/norden_pop_density.gif ) . 
  you are probably right , but then again , i 'm not very interested in penises so have n't looked very closely at them . 
  at a glance they look more or less the same . 
  i never understood this . 
  i 've seen erect circumcised penises only in porn , but they look the same as erect uncircumcised . 
  maybe some scars and weird colour differences , so maybe some chicks dig that ? 
  because there is no minimum wage in nordic countries written in law . 
  minimum wages instead vary from field to field and are based on collective bargaining agreements between unions and employers ( 's unions ) . 
  in finnish : shield toad , dust sucker , motor road , stream horse , horn snout , ear jewellery , attic dog , seal , toilet seat , butter bread , seed goahti/teepee , peanut butter , wash bear , fried egg , potato . 
  homosexual activity was illegal until 1933 in denmark , 1940 in iceland , 1944 in sweden , 1971 in finland and 1972 in norway . 
  i was surprised finland was n't dead last in this stat too . 
  do the schools in where you teach have a dress code for the pupils too ? 
  siberia is only beginning to warm up and usually the worst heat waves we get come from ( south - ) east . 
  the seas moderate the south-western heat waves once they reach here . 
   32 +  better yesterday it was almost 25 here and i suffered horribly all day .
