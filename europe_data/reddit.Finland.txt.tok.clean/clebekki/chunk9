  bbc world interviewed a resident who managed to escape , he said his neighbour 's fridge exploded . 
  fourth floor . 
  in finland , one smoke detector per every 60 square metres is required , and one for smaller apartments . 
  in buildings built after 2009 the smoke detectors must be mains powered with battery backup . 
  in finland it 's about 27 $ for unlimited data , calls , sms . 
  30 $ for 200mbit/s . 
  my guess is a canoe or rowing `` track '' of some sorts . 
  it 's missing at least the motorway that passes my home town . 
  google maps has it the same colour as other motorways on your maps : https://www.google.fi/maps/@62.5546169,29.7125238,11.01z?hl=en-gb ( bing maps too differentiates it from the two-lane highways [ bing maps link removed because automoderator does n't like links to bing maps apparently ... ] ) it also has these motorway signs : https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1198,h_674,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/13-3-6908753.jpg,

   btw , thank you for downvoting     i did n't downvote you , princess . 
  this is what we have to deal with in the official finnish language subreddit , where ow is a mod . 
  he basically uses his mod priviledges as downvote button , posts he do n't like get removed and comments and commenters he do n't like get banned for one day , or permanently . 
  there 's no point arguing with him . 
  5 degrees in eastern finland and raining like from esteri 's arse . 
  i 'm not sure how good a guy i am , but the losses to the danes and just a week ago to the french in hockey does n't trigger anyone . 
  i mean hockey fans are pissed off , but just at their own team and coaches , not the opponent . 
  some , like me , see those losses as more of a wake up call and can be happy for the small teams ' success . 
  but losing to sweden is always the end of the world . 
   there 's a shitload of lakes called pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi means literally `` sacred lake '' in english . 
  the basic package is 19 hours of theory , 17 hours of regular driving lessons , 1 night driving lesson and 1 slippery conditions driving lesson . 
  then you have to pass a theory exam and a driving exam . 
  then after you have passed your exams and got your provisional driving licence , you have to do more lessons within two years . 
  the so called practice phase , 1h of theory , 2h of driving , and the advanced phase , 4h of theory , 4h of driving + another session at the slippery conditions track . 
  that 's about it . 
  the french tricolour . 
  my guess is some types of crime go down too , like burglaries . 
  summer cottages are prime targets for burglars during the darker and colder months , during summer it 's light and the cottages are occupied . 
  it actually goes up , because people are more active ( and more drunk perhaps ) during the warm and light nights . 
  a couple of years ago police got most crime reports in august ( 43 100 ) and least in december ( 26 400 ) . 
  even criminals hate -20 c temperatures . 
  looks more cheydinhal to me . 
  a bottle ( 0,5 l ) of kozel is 3,29 $ here , cans are `` only '' 2,49 $ . 
  `` next winter 's weather . '', 
  `` it snows and everyone is fucking pissed off . '',

  the pizza is actually only 1,69 !, 
  yeah i checked the squid rings too , 2,19 e here , ~ 1,65 e there . 
  about as expected . 
  same , iberia week here too now . 
  i wonder how much difference there is in prices between finland and poland . 
  here 's the finnish brochure : https://www.lidl-flyer.com/fi-fi/#/4378b131-2b13-11e7-a7b6-005056ab0fb6/view/flyer/page/4, 
  it was greek week here too , i wonder if the national weeks are europe-wide or it 's just a coincidence . 
  i bet italy do n't have the `` italiamo '' weeks , do you ? 
  i bought some halloumi , pretty good quality for the price . 
  you will soon be anyway , after eesti raised its alcohol tax . 
  drunk finns incoming in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  / r/oldschoolcool / material for sure . 
  not part of the attraction and probably not an emergency exit either . 
  probably for maintenance purposes , flat roofs are not ideal in a country that gets lots of snow . 
  [ this upside down house ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--0fr8hu7jts/u5rebfpzeai/aaaaaaaacaq/tjyauh1rmxk/s1600/dscn0731.jpg ) was one of my favourite `` rides '' at an amusement park when i was a kid . 
  the youth radio station of yle ( public broadcasting company ) made [ a spotify playlist ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/ylex.fi/playlist/7ljumkdq5eemvb49ejiovb ) a few years back .

  mustard is [ kotisinappi ] ( http://www.kotisinappi.fi/ ) . 
  ketchup is [ felix no added sugar ketchup ] ( http://www.felix.fi/tuotteet/ketsupit/felix+sokeroimaton+ketchup+480+g ) . 
  good read , i knew most of that already but not all . 
  did n't want to `` disqualify '' the baltics , russians and swedes from answering although i knew they all have their own sauna cultures . 
  banya definitely qualifies as a type of sauna , and i 'd say so does turkish baths . 
  i 'm not an expert on zombie metabolism , but i 'm pretty sure they would freeze their asses in the winter . 
  most males in finland have some military training , so the defence forces would be mobilized and slow zombies would be easy pickings even for the worst shooters . 
  low population density means the breakout would n't be too quick to handle , and about 180 000 islands in as many lakes would make life difficult for zombie hordes . 
  in finland those are not lockable , or i 'm doing something wrong and ca n't figure out how to lock them . 
  in finland there have been plenty of german and swedish shows on tv , `` classics '' mostly . 
  i do n't remember anything from france , if you do n't count fort boyard . 
  it 's mostly american and british here too though . 
  * h\u00e4kkinen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haitabpqhas, 
  i know i do that , do n't know about others . 
  i rarely go to the cinema , i rarely watch tv , but i used to do both a lot . 
  the subtitles at cinema are even more `` compressed '' than on telly or dvd/br , they subtitle only the bare minimum to get the point across so that the first line is in finnish and the second in swedish . 
  that means that each line stays on screen for shorter than in the other media , but at least my mind and eyes still scan all of it and i constantly find mistakes in both subtitles . 
  this can be really distracting when i understand all three languages quite well , so i prefer to watch movies at home . 
  without subtitles if it 's in english , with only finnish ( or english ) subtitles if it 's another language . 
  same in finland . 
  usually there are also subtitled versions with original voices available , many people prefer it that way . 
  a tabloid in finland just had an article that `` lucifer 's tail '' is going to hit finland this week . 
  it might get to a scorching 23 c in southern finland for a day !, 
  i hope the government has emergency plans ready . 
  here in the north the last couple of summers have been very cool . 
  `` continental '' europe has had it rough though . 
  the original huy fong brand has a rooster , flying goose is another popular brand , apparently more popular in germany . 
  the offbrand versions are overly sweet in my opinion , most have at least double the amount of sugar than the original huy fong . 
  where i live you find the original brand at almost every grocery store . 
  oh boi , that song reminds me of my conscription . 
  the other one is californication by rhcp , both big hits back then . 
  we used to play both a lot in our room at the barracks , the other one sarcastically and the other because we liked it .

  have to use emulators for c64 and ps1 though so it 's not quite the same . 
  i wonder if kids back then telegraphed their parents and asked to send them nudes . 
  during conscription the usual : assault rifle , light machine gun , heavy machine gun and i was one of the lucky ones on my company to fire a live light anti-tank weapon , in addition to several practice ones . 
  also threw a couple live hand grenades but those are not guns . 
  before conscription i had fired a 9mm cz pistol , 12 and 16 gauge shotguns , .22 rifle and pistol , and of course air rifles and pistols . 
  the pistols were my neighbour 's dad 's , the shotguns and rifles were my dad 's . 
  after conscription i have n't fired any weapons . 
  pouta : dry weather , fair weather , not raining l\u00f6yly : steam specifically when throwing water on a kiuas, 
  they have romanian flair , so my guess is romania . 
  i learnt english , swedish and german in school , i also went to an english speaking kindergarten . 
  english i still use daily so i am almost fluent . 
  swedish i almost never have to use so although i spoke it pretty well years ago , not so much anymore .
