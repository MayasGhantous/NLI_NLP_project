  when people got upset by the amount of people our politicians told us `` you got ta understand that there is war in syria , and we got ta help them '' ... now out of those 30 000 people +5 000 or something that came this year , only around 6 000 + got accepted ( [ source ] ( http://www.migri.fi/download/65768_tp-paatokset_tammi_elo_2016.pdf?4834a8f68c30d488 ) in finnish ) . 
  now we can hope that the other 25 000 + go home or do n't do anything bad here . 
  there are already reports of some of them disappearing or going to seek asylum to neighboring countries like sweden or germany . 
  there are of course , a lot of other things fucked up in this process that not many people are aware , and some people still naively believe that this what we are doing is good for us . 
  but does n't life imprisonment vary a lot ? 
  this map makes it seem like life imprisonment is somehow the same in every country . 
  people do n't like that he gets treated like human even tho he is a scumbag, 
  not really , although this is kinda blown out of proportion . 
  we right now are having a plan to have subjects support each other . 
  in history class you will learn why did the population start to grow so fast and then the next class at geography you learn about it too and the problems it makes etc. 
  stuff like that mostly right now at least . 
  dota 2 player from estonia , one of the most succesful ones in the world actually . 
  you also have to have some kind of pay tho , since low pay just encourages corruption . 
  low populated cities usually always look the same at the first sight . 
  go to turku or helsinki , those are pretty unique cities . 
  well yes , nokia was one of the reasons . 
  we believed too much in nokia and every political decision was made to benefit nokia and when it crashed , we crashed . 
  nowadays things are looking brighter . 
  unemployent rates are still high but the economy is growing but slowly ( 0,5 % growth last year ) . 
   rkp ( centre ) what ? 
  i am pretty sure they are centre-right . 
  and green party does n't really identify themselves as any of those , but they are centre-right . 
  our welfare state has gotten weaker mainly because we have had 2 significant depressions in the last 20 years . 
  now we got rid of our second depression , we can only hope we do n't have another one . 
  i am fairly positive that that would completely destroy our welfare state . 
  using switzerland as an example of direct democracy is stupid . 
  it is only partially like that and there are many other factors why they do well . 
  big international companies operate in english here . 
  nokia for example afaik is 100 % english speaking company . 
  although to get these kinda jobs is a tough work :p, 
   sure , you wo n't mind someone knowing that you bought some apples at the local supermarket last saturday morning , but you might want to keep other things private ... like what exactly ? 
  am i suppose to be scared of someone seeing me buying porn or something ? 
  was n't there some people doing terrorists attacks that came to the country as refugees ? 
  i do n't think your statement is 100 % true, 
   switzerland is fairly multicultural oh yeah and it is a federal state and in the state people are divided into their own groups . 
  you can have a multicultural society but it needs to be federal one which people live in different communities . 
  every single multiethnic nation is like this and switzerland is n't really that good example because it 's mostly white . 
   the californian dream if we forget that there is dozens more of violent crime there and really poor neighborhoods and only count the rich people ( see . 
  mainly whites ) then yes it is a great place . 
   heck even rich gulf countries have become multicultural societies ( due to immigration ) and they 're still rich hahahaha :d you really do n't even know what the fuck are you talking about do you ? 
  the immigrants in those countries are fucking slaves you know and they are not citizens . 
   because ` merica ? 
  or france ? 
  uk maybe ? 
  do n't understand  it 's definitely not the norm explain how it 's not . 
  fucking i link you a map of london which you can clearly see it shows that it is a trend . 
  do you want more ? 
  why are you dismissing it ? 
  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/57/bb/03/57bb03d9d9e0a0290000dc7ff69ef4ff.png http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1319789/thumbs/o-racial-dot-map-900.jpg?6  it 's definitely not the norm , also the black communities over there were formed because of colonialism/slavery it is not only the black communities it is also the asian communities , latino communities etc. 
  your statement only holds true when we are talking about it in federal wise ( blacks mostly reside in ex-slave states ) but the ones who have moved to other cities still remain in black neighborhoods . 
   you linked to a google search and this is the first map that showed up , which is roughly the opposite of your point , with the obvious exceptions being central african countries ( where diversity is due to it being sort of a belt between animist/christian and muslim africa ) and megastates like china india and russia , which are huge and obviously are religiously diverse . 
  here you go , i was n't meant to link that . 
  even tho you can see the religious divide in these countries as well tho ... https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/list_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level%2c_list_based_on_fearon%27s_analysis.png/1200px-list_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level%2c_list_based_on_fearon%27s_analysis.png at least in my country it is pretty common knownledge that african countries have a lot of problems cause of the bad borders which were drawn by colonialists not by people . 
  also can we talk about the fact that in multicultural society people tend to lean towards right-wing monetary policy ? 
  they do n't want to pay the social services of other races cause they do n't identify with them . 
  white man in texas does not wan na pay some poor blacks school in detroit etc. 
  nationalism and the sense of a one community is what drived nordic countries to have these social welfare systems . 
  multiculturalism destroys this . 
   not really , identity politics , or race above all else , is different from hanging out with people you identify with it 's a start of what becomes identity politics . 
   and that too is not the norm everywhere , and imo is in general symptom of something else ( eg `` immigrant '' neighborhoods are usually just poor neighborhoods , and immigrants make up much of the poor population ) . 
  why is there then rich black neighbourhoods ? 
  why is a white flight a thing ? 
  why did n't whites move out when there were poor whites there ? 
  i also have asian friends who i hang out with , but majority of my friends are white and i see the divide on backgrounds . 
  middle-easteners hang out with each other , somalis hang out with each other , asians hangout with each other and whites hang out with each other . 
  it 's like nerds hanging out with nerds etc. 
  it 's not absolute but the correlation is there . 
  look at [ the ethnic map of london ] ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2015/dec/london-ethnic-1.jpg ) , you ca n't just say this is just a coincidence that people have choosed the same neighborhoods as their counterparts . 
   that 's not true , syrian borders were artificially drawn , but it is not more multicultural than most countries in the world , and multiculturalism is not the issue ( it may have shaped the dynamics of the conflict , but not caused it ) . 
  i do n't know if you get the message ( it might be my english ) but yes , i meant that syrian borders were artificially drawn it was not a ethostate to begin with . 
  what do you mean `` most countries in the world '' ? 
  european countries are almost all of them pretty homogenic . 
  [ in this map you see the ethnic and religious composition of syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:syria_ethno-religious_composition..jpg ) . 
  most people there are sunnis ( 68,4 % about and that is pretty low ) and even in this sunni religion there are different enthnic groups with different interests ( kurds , turkmen etc ) . 
  this is why [ federalization of syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalization_of_syria ) is a concept and sdf supports it to solve the conflicts ( also because it would be great for kurds to have their own state ) . 
  syrian civil war was not really started by multiculturalism , but you can see how the war divides people into their own groups . 
  un tried to solve israel-palestine conflict by splitting up the land because they figured out that these two groups ca n't live under the same roof . 
  one of the main problems why africa is so bad off is cause it is so multicultural . 
  look at this map : https://www.google.fi/search?q=diversity+of+nations&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewijw8x6xcbvahxha5okhw66chiq_auicigb&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=919#imgrc=hvaqfzwmvg6mtm: i see a correlation on poor countries and the diversity of the people there . 
  with few expections like canada and botswana ( btw it is not a coincidence that botswana is really well of and that it is one of the richest countries in sub-saharan africa ) it is pretty clear that if the country is multicultural there is a lot of problems . 
  i do n't think you actually need to be an idiot to do identity politics . 
  the only thing that person needs to do is be different from the main population and then he or she does n't share the same identity as others and starts to identify as ` put x ethnic group , race or religion here ' and therefore starts to act like a member of that group instead of acting as the member of main group ( finns , swedes etc ) . 
  there is no situation where a black man identifies as much to some white man as he does on some black man . 
  it is only natural and you see this when people choose to be friends with people that look like them and when they live in neighborhoods filled with people who look like them or share the same background ( white flight ) . 
  there is a reason why there are borders . 
  they were drawm by people sharing the identity and countries like syria whos borders were drawn not by people living there are at war . 
  if in modern day you see a civil war the country is most likely very ` multicultural ' . 
  if there is diversity , there is identity politics . 
  it is disgusting but that 's the reality . 
  any reason why is jewish population increasing in germany but decreasing in france etc. 
  eli5 : what are the benefits for haing high gpd per capita ? 
  the prices inside the country are gon na be high as fuck so it would n't be any different from low gpd per capita country where the prices are low ? 
  so , how much are say norwegians or swiss better of than swedes or finns ? 
  the amout on people accepted in sweden is ridiculous . 
  that is over 1 % of your whole population ... that is just crazy, 
  no one really knows , it may drop or it may increase . 
  since the structure of party has changed entirely no one can really say which one will it be . 
  the finns party used to be right-wing populistic party with centrist economic ideology and they were against the eu and some what anti-immigration but not too much . 
  they worked as a party you would vote if you were frustrated to main stream parties and wanted change . 
  now the party is economically right and also really anti-immigration .
