mountains . 
  pretty much yes . 
  well they can go to the police if it 's legalized too . 
  the only difference being that the law does n't punish the buyer . 
  yes it is . 
  have fun . 
  the act of buying is illegal while selling is not . 
  prostitute gets money and the buyer gets fines if he is busted . 
  umm . 
  if the prostitute books a time in the dungeon and has no other contracts there i think it 's okay . 
  i 'm not an expert in this field so i could be wrong :|, 
  it 's legal here and in denmark if it 's not organized and i feel like that system works well . 
  the laws in norway , sweden , and iceland are really stupid like you said . 
  source for finland trying to join nato ? 
  i 'm 99 % sure that we never tried . 
  it was in 1939 . 
  that was probably just a typo though . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  they could flank us so we have to be prepared for that too . 
  i have the button on my keyboard right next to \u00c5 . 
  it allows to write some letters that are not on the keyboard . 
  you push it and then you push the other letter . 
  i can do this \u00eb\u00ff\u00fc\u00ef and i bet you have the button too . 
  you can use these in a similar fashion . 
  i do n't understand . 
  i thought that [ this flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3fbu7ik.png ) was the lgbt homogay flag ? 
  transylvania has nothing to do with it . 
  i ca n't believe that they messed up denmark 's flag either . 
  yes . 
  we have a fairly big amount of swedes on the coastal regions and swedish is a national language of finland . 
  if enough people in the municipality speaks swedish then all the signs will be in swedish too . 
   helsinki is a bit ugly , but the countryside is adorable :( i 'd suggest you to visit seurasaari . 
  it 's quite pleasant place and if you like nature , old buildings and squirrels you 'd love it . 
  depending on where you live in espoo biking there could be viable . 
  there 's few pictures in wikipedia . 
  [ here ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/seurasaari ) and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seurasaari ) . 
  i also remember talking to you earlier this year about me planning to bike to riga . 
  that did n't unfortunately happen due to sickness and i 'm hoping to do it next summer . 
  you could go to espoon keskus . 
  it 's not actually the centre but the name means `` centre of espoo '' . 
  welcome to finland and sorry about espoo . 
  some people came to my school ( in helsinki ) from there and judging by them it must really be a pain to live there . 
  edit : last bit is obviously / s, 
  there is just a board with the coat of arms of helsinki and a text `` helsinki '' . 
  [ here is a picture . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/welcome_to_helsinki.jpg ) edit : most municipalities in finland have a coat of arms . 
  [ here is a wikipedia page with all of them . 
  ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_kunnanvaakunat ) [ similar page for the swedish ones if you want to take a look . 
  ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruotsin_kuntavaakunat ) sadly there are no pages in english . 
  why does the hand belong to sweden in that map ? 
  the swedes are not at all drag to our nation and society . 
  they do n't have to be a drag if you manage it correctly . 
   i have nothing against people speaking their native tongue . 
  but for the love god learned to speak the official and required language i think that this is a bit conflicting . 
  if hungarian was an official language there would be less problems . 
  you said that you 'd want them to learn romanian or throw them out of the country even if they 're natives . 
  that is discriminating against hungarians and pretty much counts as racism . 
  the way we deal with the swedish speaking minority works quite well . 
  they have to learn finnish in theory but many of them do n't . 
  we provide all the services in swedish too . 
  your `` though luck either learn it or get out '' attitude is truly toxic and borderline racist . 
  i seriously hope that this is n't common view held by romanians . 
   why should n't one speak the language of his country the language of their country is n't their language . 
  all i 'm saying is that it would be good for the hungarians to get all the education and services in hungarian . 
  that 's not ` special ' treatment . 
  that would be equal treatment . 
  i 'm also not saying that they should n't be educated . 
  i do n't know where you got that from . 
  the roman empire and modern day romania are entirely different and giving hungarians autonomy would n't cause the collapse of your country . 
   they live in romania so they should at least speak the bloody language . 
  this is a truly toxic attitude . 
  because they happen to live in romania they should speak romanian ? 
  that 's bullshit . 
  they have been there so long that they should be considered natives and their language should be granted official status . 
  ( i could n't find any sources that it would already be ) i do n't think that you 're keeping them in slavery . 
  i just think that romania is n't being entirely fair to them . 
  yes it is . 
  it 's still quite silly though because a , o , \u00e4 and \u00f6 are all different letters and pronounced differently . 
  \u00c5 is a swedish/norwegian/danish thing . 
   they can spend all their life without talking one bit of romanian . 
  which is stupid in my opinion . 
  why is it stupid ? 
  to me it seems like you have some grudge against hungarians which would actually make you a racist . 
   we do not want to visit museums under any circumstance . 
  this is a big mistake . 
  museums are the best places you can visit in europe . 
  they would probably get hungarian as an official language in the region . 
  i do n't understand what is so bad about autonomous regions . 
  hungarians are a big minority ( ~ 6,5 % ) in romania and a majority in sz\u00e9kely land . 
  i think it 's mistreatment of your minorities to not give them the option of autonomy . 
  it 's also stupid to think that autonomous areas would n't be full members of the state and that would n't be a reason to stop sending them money . 
  we send money to \u00c5land and denmark sends money to gr\u00f6nland for example . 
  you could also ask how the \u00c5landers profit from the autonomy they have and i ca n't really answer to that . 
  they do n't have us finns meddling with their business at least . 
  romania already pays for their education and healthcare . 
  what would really change except they could make their own decisions regarding their own issues ? 
  not there . 
  the kingdoms were still separate . 
  it was denmark , norway and sweden under one crown and not just denmark . 
  we do this too .
