  i do n't care about karelia but it would be nice if we could maybe buy petsamo back . 
  having a port up there could be useful . 
  i do n't know how many people live there bit it ca n't be too many . 
  i know they do n't want to sell and finland does n't want to buy so it does n't really matter . 
  nah m8 , the swedes have very limited amount of ways the word can end . 
  georgia and ukraine . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if someone is allowed to dislike russia it 's estonians ( and other baltics ) . 
  i do n't like russia that much either and it has nothing to do with recent events . 
  i 'm sure that invidual russians can be great people but the way the russians have acted towards us is quite annoying and tiring . 
  people can have real reasons for disliking russia too . 
  you should know that . 
  just a fun fact . 
  finland did n't have unified constitution until 2000 . 
  we had many constitutional laws all over the place . 
  i think that even now we have 4 different constitutional documents . 
  thanks for the warning . 
  i have n't actually seen proper saunas outside of finland and estonia . 
  i heard that russians have quite good saunas too . 
  that 's one thing they have n't fucked up . 
   i really ca n't handle the saunas either i think that this is normal if you have n't been saunaing regularly . 
  at least you have the `` go outside to roll on snow '' part down already . 
  you 'll get used to it . 
  i currently live in an apartment building and we have only one sauna in the building which sucks . 
  i 'll go to my grandparents ' summer cottage soon where they have 2 saunas . 
  my grandparents ' do n't really use them anymore because they are so old so i have 2 saunas all for myself !, 
  that 's super neat !, 
  it 's always fun to hear that people are interested in our language and culture . 
  does your coworker speak an eastern dialect ? 
  they can make conversations with foreigners tricky sometimes . 
  read the article about [ consonant gradation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consonant_gradation#finnish ) and say that again  to me that does n't make any sense . 
  we have also many other rules that do n't really make sense to me . 
  no , there is not enough space in sauna . 
  20 cm is the minimum in sauna but preferably more . 
  also the 2 meter bubble may have been a joke but it 's quite true . 
  there are exceptions such as friends , family members and situations like lifts and buses . 
  ninja edit : i 'm of course speaking about my own small sauna . 
  in public saunas you must give more space . 
  ah , thank you . 
  if i can understand norwegian to some extent i 'm sure that the swedes can too . 
  norwegian sound like funny swedish and danish is unintelligible even to the danes . 
  how do expat differ from immigrants ? 
  are n't expats immigrants too ? 
  nobody brings knives to sauna . 
  sauna is a sacred place and no weapons or fighting allowed . 
  drinking is fine . 
  i 'll post the sauna rules here : 1 . 
  no clothes 1 . 
  no weapons 1 . 
  do n't open the door after water has been thrown on the stones 1 . 
  do n't wear clothes 1 . 
  do n't touch others 1 . 
  no clothes, 
  english is quite easy in my opinion and it has plenty of rules which make sense . 
  i like it that we can have a language which almost everyone can speak . 
  of course the language should be finnish but i ca n't do anything about that ( yet ) . 
  american conspiracy to lure sweden and finland to nato . 
  there is n't really that much influence . 
  it 's really hard to borrow words because dropping an english word to the middle of a sentence is a pain in the ass . 
  most have also a bit quirky accent and are a bit hesitant to use english . 
  i think it 's good because we have such a beautiful language . 
  just google `` kuusi palaa '' for examples . 
  is n't h\u00e4h\u00e4h\u00e4h\u00e4h\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4 the evil laugh ? 
  why would he drink wine ? 
  real men drink vodka !, 
  midsommar is much better anyways . 
  i assume that you get drunk , burn giant fires and grill food . 
  we also do the sauna thing which i think you do n't do to the same extent anyway . 
  me too . 
  i liked the kroon . 
  it 's a bit sad that i do n't have any anymore . 
  i 've got some kroons from 1929 but i guess those do n't count . 
  we do n't have 0,5 l cans here but the 0,5 l bottles are 2 $ -2,50 $ here . 
  fuck you . 
  in finland it 's called `` jesari '' which is shortened form of `` jeesus teippi '' . 
  literally it means `` jesus tape '' because it makes miracles happen . 
  those numbers do n't represent that . 
  we do n't want war either . 
  6 months if anyone is wondering . 
  ( 9 and 12 are possible too ), 
  conscription is n't mandatory for women but they can still decide to go . 
  in wwii we had [ lotta sv\u00e4rd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lotta_sv%c3%a4rd ) . 
  they were pretty important but did n't really fight on the front . 
  no hockey . 
  oh you think that sweden and finland would n't sit and chill there if we could ? 
  good joke . 
  the point of being neutral is to not engage in situations like that . 
  as others already said it 's because it 's criminalized and people are scared to get help because it would label them as criminals . 
  it 's sad :(, 
  are n't the biggest drug consumers the russians in estonia ? 
  is that what you mean ? 
  no it means `` iiiiiislaaaaand ... '' ^ ^ shitty ^ ^ joke ^ ^ i ^ ^ know, 
  nato tonks definitely better than communist russian tonks . 
  communist tonks ca n't shoot through nato tonks . 
  nato tonks best tonks . 
  leopard fueled by fuel , can do over 70 km/h , has 120mm gun , can shoot through 1 abrams m1 . 
  leopard best non-imaginary tonk . 
  leopard fueled by the power of burning communist universes , can do over 5000km/h , has 800mm gun , can shoot through 600 abrams m1 . 
  leopard best tonk in whole multiverses multiverses multiverse . ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ getting ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ ridiculous ? 
  leopard fueled by the power of burning communist countries , can do over 3000km/h , has 440mm gun , can shoot through 200 abrams m1 . 
  leopard best tonk in whole multiverse .
