  leopard fueled by the power of communist blood , can do over 1000km/h , has 200mm gun , can shoot through 30 abrams m1 . 
  leopard best tonk . 
  nooo the tracks are not visible . 
  you ca n't throw a big birch log in there . 
  ( tactic used against soviet tanks in the winter and continuation wars ), 
  leopard best tonk , remove abrams . 
   given our history of declaring neutrality that on its turn was n't respected that sounds somehow familiar ... 
  pfft . 
  makes sense . 
  i took a picture of it . 
  this is completely unrelated but how can your flair be the eu one in some of your comments and finland in some others ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  we have also another word for urine which is pissa . 
  i do n't know if those are related . 
  water is vesi in finnish and it 's quite similar to viz . 
  interesting . 
  what i have heard is that he shortest words are most similar because the do n't change as easily or something like that . 
  for example `` voi '' which means butter is pretty similar in all uralic languages as is `` kusi '' which means urine and `` veri '' which is blood . 
  well fuck me then . 
  big part of that is just gibberish but not entirely . 
  so swedes and norwegians have fake rye bread ? 
  pfft . 
  with my limited estonian i 'd bet on `` kaksteist kuud '' and `` aasta '' would be `` year '' if google translate is right . 
  what was the point of your comment ? 
  does sai also mean `` received '' in estonian . 
  saaja is the exact same in finnish . 
  that meaning for the word `` sai '' feels so wrong to me . 
  it does n't have to be wood . 
  the golden parts of the [ uspenski cathedral ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/uspenski_cathedral_helsinki_2012.jpg ) in helsinki are actually copper plates . 
  the amount of gold on that buildings roof is about as much as is in an average wedding ring . 
  if you go there you should probably visit kyoto too . 
  it has a ton of historical sites and was spared of bombings during wwii . 
  it 's over 3 million right now . 
  some said that [ this ] ( http://d3sd9qpucc1g5p.cloudfront.net/scaler/f6aa7c961da06d429d3e7d178a814670e1cf80bbf33c554d8911b3078a175604 ) was cringey . 
  i think it was funny . 
  i know what you mean . 
  it sounds similar and i still ca n't understand anything . 
  it 's so annoying . 
  the same thing happens with sami . 
  if you have never heard sami [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npgpbejbruu ) is a clip of o\u0111\u0111asat ( sami news ) . 
  the subtitles are in swedish so disregard them . 
  i can sort of understand estonian so it 's not as annoying . 
  well they have more cases . 
  it has many similar aspects grammarwise but still sounds like alien speech . 
  there is almost none common vocabulary . 
  probably . 
  german is n't that far off from english . 
  hungarian is an alien language which nobody understands . 
  i did n't see that . 
  still that 's pretty impressive . 
  why do we always suck at the economy stuff . 
  uhh , norwegians sure are richer . 
  they are n't that rich but they seriously are n't poor . 
  their ppp adjusted gdp per capita is a bit higher than us but a bit lower than the icelanders . 
  they should n't have that much to complain about really . 
  things are just fine there . 
  winter war was part of wwii . 
  finland was invaded for the same reason as poland was ( molotov-ribbentrop pact ) so it should definitely count . 
  i know . 
  nationalism have n't been that big thing anywhere in europe after wwii . 
  i 'd imagine that being nationalistic in belgium would be hard anyways . 
  hey but that 's something they can be proud of if they score so high !, 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  it 's not our fault that others do n't like the dark winters , high prices , cold weather and friendly people . 
  so it means that the food went through too quickly ? 
  what does das durchfall mean ? 
  i thought that pencil meant stift and pen meant ballpoint pen . 
  kugelschreiber is still super cool word . 
  ( kuula = ball , k\u00e4rki = point , kyn\u00e4 = pen ), 
  i think that kugelschreiber takes the cake . 
  if i 'm correct it means pen . 
  hilariously long word for pen . 
  ( yeah , our word for it is kuulak\u00e4rkikyn\u00e4 . 
  not much better . ), 
  does n't matter . 
  we 'll buy finnish beer from estonia too because it 's cheaper . 
  we have so big taxes on alcohol products here or something like that . 
  [ democracy \u2122 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/b-2_spirit_bombing.jpg ) delivery !, 
  this conversation sums up international politics pretty well ... 
  i 'll probably come there during the summer holiday . 
  i 'll have to bookmark your offer or something so i 'll remember . 
  you are awesome . 
  thank you !, 
  i checked this from their website and it 's actually free . 
  they 'll allow it if there is enough room for the bike . 
  i 've never seen a bus with full cargo so it should probably be fine . 
  i do n't know about people being grumpier there . 
  estonians always seemed cheerful people to me . 
  to be honest we have some soviet-style buildings as well . 
  the gray beton cubes are just awful . 
  i do n't know why but they imitated the soviet buildings a lot back in the 60s . 
  the buildings just have better insulation than the ones in ussr . 
  i also wanted to ask about the bus line . 
  do you know am i allowed to take a bike with me or is there a fee or something . 
  thanks . 
  what the hell ? 
  i have to pay at least 20 $ to get to kotka which is n't even that far . 
  ( i live in helsinki ) we do n't have wifi or electric sockets . 
  they are not shitholes . 
  they may be a bit worse off than many other countries but they are doing pretty well now .
