  boring and uncharismatic ? 
  that he certainly is . 
  he 's a former businessman and does n't drink alcohol but i ca n't think of any other similarities . 
  his actions were very naive and show his inexperience as a politician . 
  of course the press would be interested his cousins company got the deal even if that was n't intentional . 
  sending the angry emails was incredibly stupid and counterproductive . 
   i 'll enjoy watching him try to get out of this mess . 
  he 'll just say he regrets sending the emails and it happened in the heat of the moment . 
  there probably was n't anything shady in the original deal so i highly doubt anyone will resign over this . 
  i lived in germany as a kid and most people said gr\u00fcss gott . 
  we lived in baden-w\u00fcrttenberg , about a kilometre from the swiss border . 
   `` moi '' it 's almost never used in the north . 
  we either say `` moro '' , `` morjesta '' , or `` terve '' . 
  reminds me of the old joke about lahti . 
   i imagine it was a great source of amusement to trick a poor urbanite stranger into placing a `` testicle lake '' in official records . 
  many of the surveyors did n't speak finnish which probably added to the hilarity . 
  implying it was a poor choice ? 
  besides , they were upgraded to have ground-attack capabilities afterwards . 
  we have both , m\u00e4mmi is just a traditional easter dessert . 
  gravlax is great btw , i prefer to make it by myself . 
  `` pretty strong smell '' is a serious understatement . 
  you want to open the can outdoors , preferably downwind of any humans nearby . 
  written danish i can actually decipher . 
  it 's not that different to swedish . 
  the problem arises when it 's pronounced . 
  i understand some spoken swedish but danish on the other hand ... about as intelligible as hebrew . 
  why do n't you work to the economist then , i 'm sure they 'd appreciate your insight . 
  last week swedes violated finnish airspace near \u00c5land . 
  mistakes happen , only when it becomes a regular incident it 's more serious . 
  yup , it 's the west line . 
  a huge mess of a project but it seems the first part will open next january . 
  [ the new ones will look slightly better ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/lansimetro/sets/72157629328857858/ ) . 
  finns party ca n't be pinned on one political axis . 
  basically they are socially conservative social democrats . 
  what is going on with finland ? 
  in reality we have one centrist , one centre left and one centre right . 
  preserving history is nationalism now ? 
  i hope you do n't vote . 
  gamla stan makes only a tiny fraction of stockholms surface area . 
  tearing down a part of your cultural heritage is one of the worst ideas i 've ever heard . 
  either we lower regulations to china levels or subsidy new buildings . 
  free market is useless when it does n't benefit the people . 
  it will happen eventually , hopefully before we are annihilated by climate change . 
  the inherent contradictions of capitalism will destroy it just like what happened with previous modes of production . 
  it would be naive to think we are living at the end of history . 
  a clear mandate for comrade hoxha to build a few thousand more bunkers . 
  noticeable but his pronounciation is good . 
  careful , the thread will soon be full of pissed off turkish nationalists . 
  there seems to be quite a lot of them on this site . 
  bunkers , interesting language and good footballers who may or may not actually represent albania . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/relativevalue.php?use%5b%5d=cpi&amp;use%5b%5d=nominalearn&amp;year_early=1660&amp;pound71=400&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=400&amp;year_source=1660&amp;year_result=2017 ) tl ; dr : it was a large sum of money . 
   basically we have n't needed rules because people were just too darn nice and got along [ not really . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85dalen_shootings ) swedish workers have struggled very hard to gain what they have now . 
  you only get concessions when you are organized and have power , not by asking nicely . 
  that 's always a claim which should light up your bullshit detector . 
  the guy is pretty eccentric . 
  selling it here is illegal but you can bring a restricted amount for personal use . 
  of course the law is broken constantly and smugglers are making a lot of money . 
  it 's basically finland with some subtle differences , going there does n't really feel like going abroad . 
  you can buy snus there legally which is nice . 
  you 'd think so . 
  our postal service is expensive and shitty but you can hire them to rake the leaves from your yard and mow the lawn . 
  [ not even kidding . 
  is n't that basically a cv90 with a body conversion kit ? 
  protip : drinking beer is actually bad if you are trying to stay hydrated . 
  `` why does n't anyone think of the rich people ?! '', 
  modern day stalinists are mostly doing book clubs and shitty youtube videos with a few thousand views while far-right and social darwinist sentiment is growing day by day in europe and us . 
  i honestly ca n't relate to your worries in any form . 
  stalinists are dumb historical revisionists while nazis and other far right people directly threaten ethnical and sexual minorities . 
  you should get your history straight , the soviets did n't collectivise agriculture when lenin was the party 's chairman . 
  after the revolutions in western europe failed he tried to implement some kind of a social democratic economic system with the nep . 
  the revolution also resulted the decriminalisation of homosexuality , improved womens rights and a land reform . 
  you seem to care more about agitation than facts though . 
  nice dodge . 
  how do you plan to implement this new world order though ? 
  forced deportations , sterilisations or what ? 
  and let me guess , the best way to preserve your mythical and idealised traditions is a white ethno-state ? 
  you should try to understand the historical context and the effect of propaganda . 
  putin is bringing them some stability at last and every news media is telling them how the west is trying to impose their power and influence on russia . 
  that 's not of course completely wrong , it 's how the world works . 
  the anti-russia circlejerk on this sub is ridiculous and irrational to be honest . 
  that 's basically what china is doing . 
  the problem with that approach is that the decisions of the experts actually effect the lives of other people , thus they are political . 
  most of the time there are winners and losers . 
  all people do n't share the same economic and social interests . 
  you do n't necessarily need to be a nationalist to want independence . 
  [ paavo v\u00e4yrynen for president ] ( http://kepu.fi/ ), 
  we never stop posting . 
  / r/suomi is n't large enough to contain the rare political drama we are experiencing . 
  you guys have fights in the parliament and shit but our politics are so bland and boring most of the time . 
  i do n't get why the splinter group was so keen on propping up sipil\u00e4 . 
  there 's nothing they can hope to achieve in the government at this point . 
  that was anticlimactic . 
  i was hoping for a longer and more entertaining crisis but with the splinter group the government has a majority . 
  expect a direct ferry connection from helsinki to riga this summer . 
  brace yourselves latvians . 
  is n't v\u00e4yrynen recruiting for his new party ? 
  they would get along splendidly . 
  a goverment of ncp + greens + rkp or something like that would be just like the current one with slightly different aesthetics . 
  i 'm not too enthusiastic .
