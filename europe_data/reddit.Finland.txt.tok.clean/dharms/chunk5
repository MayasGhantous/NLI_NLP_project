  none of his daughters would theoretically inherit the throne anyway . 
  according to the current law the heir apparent is [ karl friedrich von hohenzollern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_friedrich,_prince_of_hohenzollern ) . 
  he does n't want the the throne though so it would fall to his son [ alexander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander,_hereditary_prince_of_hohenzollern ) . 
  picking mushrooms in finland has been a long tradition only in the east and the habit has spread to the other parts only quite recently . 
  most of the harvest is still unutilised . 
  there is a huge market for mushrooms abroad , mainly in italy . 
  what will replace them in your opinion ? 
  humans are tribal animals and will naturally drift towards social groups . 
  almost every apartment and house here has a sauna by default . 
  as an indenpedent mp he would n't really be a figurehead of anything . 
  minister appointments are an internal matter for parties so i guess he wo n't be a minister for much longer . 
  in theory they could even fire him from the party but he would still remain an mp . 
  novelty value . 
  i would n't mind owning one but riding it probably is n't fun . 
   this would probably be one of the big reasons finnish imigrants find it easier to adapt in sweden . 
  it might help in some cases but the swedish you learn in school is at a very basic level and most people are n't very motivated in learning it . 
  cultural similarity is a much larger factor imo . 
  at least here in finland only old people like to keep their money as cash . 
  debit/credut cards and online banking are so extremely convenient there 's very little need for physical money . 
  why to write a new one ? 
  there 's no way the ban could be enforced at any case . 
  actually you never lose all your benefits no matter what . 
  it would be unconstitutional . 
  in spain it would n't be but by ostrobothnia standards that 's quite old . 
  russians burned down most of the older ones during the [ great northern war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_during_the_great_northern_war ) . 
  yes it was arson . 
  the suspect has confessed already but police is n't commenting the case any further . 
  not our own one for sure , it 's boring as hell . 
  het wilhelmus , god save the queen and fratelli d'italia are maybe my favourites . 
  it 's not the official anthem though . 
  i do n't know how you feel about your current anthem but i like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) song much more . 
  this incident is bad enough but i would be absolutely gutted if some idiot burned down my home town church . 
  the walls are full of paintings from the 18th century and were paid by families which still have living descendants there . 
  churches are the prime examples of old craftsmanship and you can smell the history every time you go to one . 
  personal feelings about religion are irrelevant in recognising their cultural value . 
  fuck the guy who did this . 
  destroying public and culturally significant property is sickening . 
  i hope he goes to prison for a long time . 
   sure coal is bad . 
  but hopefully it wo n't be long until those are gone too replaced by ... what ? 
  they are there because they produce continuous power . 
  renewables do not . 
   which ones in particular ? 
  i was slightly wrong here . 
  instead of opening old ones they are building new plants . 
  http://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/04/23/germany-to-open-six-more-coal-power-stations-in-2013/ https://carboncounter.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/why-germanys-nuclear-phaseout-is-leading-to-more-coal-burning/ http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26820405  germany continues to be a net exporter of electric energy , in 2015 we had a net export of 50 twh . 
  in 2015 we were a net importer with france though . 
  we imported 11 twh more than we did export to france . 
  you are right , i retract my statement . 
  that was the impression i got from the news but did n't get the full picture . 
   where do we store used fuel ? 
  mining uranium should be limited and more emphasis placed on reprocessing waste into fuel . 
  modern efficient breeder reactors like ifr can utilize used fuel producing much less radioactive waste . 
  the rest can be stored deep in bedrock in seismically stable areas . 
  besides , the long term development of technology is greatly underestimated . 
  with the time scales we are speaking of it becomes likely we 'll find a better long-term solution . 
  we should develop renewable energy techniques but they are cyclic by nature . 
  nuclear power can produce a stable source of electricity regardless of sun , wind and tides . 
  are you serious ? 
  closing down nuclear plants was the most idiotic thing germans have done since a long time . 
  it forced them to open old coal plants and import massive amounts of power from france . 
  nuclear power is one of the cleanest and safest ways to produce electricity and everyone concerned of the environment should encourage using it . 
  it was a shady business involving overproduction of copper and financing a war at the same time . 
  the `` coins '' were valued higher than the commodity value of copper but it was n't sustainable . 
  look at his post history , it was sarcasm . 
  just like the finns party is pretty much a normal centrist conservative party . 
  populists seem to become more moderate when given power . 
  i do n't think it 's a democracy if only cardinals are allowed to vote . 
  i feel we have all the keys for success but obsolete institutions and short-sighted politicians are holding us back . 
  labour unions hold disproportionate political power and housing prices in growing urban areas are artificially high which hinders people from moving for work . 
  i agree but does n't that apply to sweden as well ? 
  every time i go there it looks just like finland except the language . 
  prices are high , food is bland and people are quiet . 
  norway at least has mountains and fjords . 
  that 's about the existence of my knowledge about slovakia as well plus the fact they were a part of czechoslovakia . 
  slovenia on the other hand ... marek hamsik and gorenje kitchen appliances are the first thing i can think of . 
  mountains as well . 
  fair enough . 
  we eat that too , the local variant has mayonnaise in it . 
  i 'm suprised by your low consumption . 
  i thought you eat potatismos with everything . 
  if potatoes are stored improperly they develop [ dark spots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2ir2vx.jpg ) inside which ca n't be seen in a superficial inspection . 
  i 've sometimes seen them in even finnish potatoes . 
  swedish-speaking finns have their own strong cultural identity . 
  to my knowledge none of them consider themselves as swedes . 
  renewables ca n't produce a continuous and predictable power output . 
  until we have practical fusion reactors fission is the best we 've got . 
  some people on internet . 
  it 's illegal but it wo n't you get beaten by cops and put on the sex offender list . 
  very misleading title . 
  they are not being `` deployed '' , it 's just a training excercise . 
  the f-15 's are n't even armed . 
  gabriel faur\u00e9 as well . 
  i got [ this cd ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/51ifbvuzvol._sl500_.jpg ) from my dad as a teenager . 
  the dvorak songs were my favourites . 
  i think everyone has heard bach , beethoven and mozart at some point . 
  i would be very laborious to pick an example from every composer mentioned . 
  do n't forget chopin . 
  some people do n't even realise he was a pole . 
  jean sibelius our most internationally famous composer/musician but overall we have a very strong classical music tradition .
