  grexit would help greece much more in the long run, 
   a better candidate would be a basic old age pension , strictly tied to age because everyone gets old after all . 
  ** it would be at the subsistence minimum of the poorest country , ** so we are going to turn romania into florida then are we ? 
  black sea baths for all, 
  what a load of shit , the greek public sector is smaller than the that of the uk in terms of government employers per 100k people, 
  thats a fair point as well, 
  `` capitalism lunging from crisis to bigger crisis '' ? 
  here we are ? 
  http://imgur.com/ku1ntfd i 'd much rather be looking at what 's inside other peoples fridges though but backed out from shame after seeing i only have half eaten kebab shop pizza from last night and 1.5 l cola, 
   who is this `` everyone '' you speak of ? 
  everyone as in ... the court of public opinion , the popular narrative , the majority , call it what you want but i 've noticed a change, 
   `` you live freely if you have n't a reputation to lose . '', 
  i can totally see that on a motivational poster * `` you live freely if you have n't a reputation to lose . 
  '' * * adolf hitler *, 
  you really do n't know how pr works then do you . 
  i have n't been on reddit or following this since friday but that also makes it obvious how the public mood has changed and everyone now sees it as a german takeover of another sovereign nation * #thisisacoup *, 
  sch\u00e4uble the ellen pao of europe , now if only he would just resign as well * #thisisacoup *, 
  i 'd rather live in a log cabin with my reindeer and grow potatoes for the rest of my life than live in the federal neo liberal european union, 
  i 've often said the same about ukraine and it 's inability to wait six months for a democratic maidan instead of rioting, 
   if you 've been following ttip , you 'd know that a good chunk of the documents in this leak have been available for some time from the eu 's ttip website . 
  no , nicely worded pr summary 's have been available . 
  for the same reason i do n't read a car brochure to find out how it runs and what falls off after a few years . 
   ireland is the beneficiary of a fairly secret but very real policy of monetary financing . 
  while potentially illegal and certainly opposed by ecb and eu policy , ireland is actually paying off a substantial part of its debt to itself : ireland 's central bank took over the debt of the infamous anglo irish bank , whose speculative excesses cost the irish economy nearly 20 % of gdp when it became insolvent . 
  this is what i 've been saying for the past week regarding the `` we ca n't brake the rules '' `` our hands are tied by the ecb '' crap that schwable doodle has been singing the only difference between ireland and greece is ireland submitted itself to becoming a neo liberal tax haven for big business and sold off or monetized most of it 's remaining state assets and greece did n't . 
  it 's also worth noting ireland would be dealing with 30 % / 40 % youth unemployment as well if they were n't all highly mobile and english speaking who easily picked up jobs in the us/canada/australia and beyond edit : it 's also worth noting that debt monetary financing seems to be aimed ( in my opinion ) more toward taking the pressure off the current government as there is a very real threat of left wing sein fein taking power next year , the details of the deal stipulate that the bonds the central bank of ireland currently hold are to be sold onto the private market in increments . 
  looks like our dear eu ` eurogroup ' have been having some more secret chats about how to shape europe the way they wish behind closed doors . 
  i can smell the sweet sweet eu transparency from here, 
  oh come on , you think most people want to be part of a european superstate considering how undemocratic and frankly shit the eu has been showing itself to be over the past decade , up here in the north we are too good to have our country reduced to southern levels and the south does n't want northerners telling them what to do . 
  you 're not lying , it may well have prevented it but all that would be happening is we in the north would be paying for greece and well it 's obvious that 's not the position we want to be in so therefore slowly backing away is the logical option apart from that i would say the biggest issue here in finland is that people do n't want our good homogeneous population diluted down with refugees and their good old multicultural values because it 's now obvious how that has been a failure in the uk , france , germany , sweden . 
  people are becoming more patriotic as i 'm sure you have noticed thanks to the problems associated with immigrants and that is the dominant trend , add in some more economic hard years and it will only continue . 
  even stratfor the intelligence agency who are usually pretty on point predict rising nationalism and a possible split in the eu . 
  all people myself included want is a free trade area , even the common currency that saves me a few minutes once a twice a year changing currency is getting old thanks to the lack of economic sovereignty it brings, 
  yes but there is still no reason our side needs to be agreeing with further eu integration and i 'm sure other member states agree so right there you see how we do n't have to be on out own . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure most finn 's would agree with what i said along the lines of let 's be friends but not get married, 
  finland is not an export economy , as least not anymore as we now run a trade deficit and have done for many years . 
  there is some credit to your claim that having our own currency would mean it would be strong anyway thanks to the silliness of the euro zone but then we are free to print in order to keep it down as sweden have been doing . 
  if they actually tried to discredit geithner that is pretty ridiculous given his standing and credibility . 
  ireland got permission to turn their private banking debt into t bills issued by their central bank with a 40 year maturity . 
  i ca n't find the link now as i 'm on mobile but basically the descussion was , why did the ` troika ' break their own rules when mr germany minister is here saying to greece rules are not to be broken and xyz is illegal . 
  it 's clear to me there is two euro zones . 
  one for the good guys and a debtors prison for the rest they do n't like the look of . 
  and let 's not talk about germany breaking surplus stability and growth rules and france for it 's deficit spending . 
  he 'll even finland is now breaking the the rules as well now but who cares we are good guys right ? 
  thank you , i finally laughed , time to hang up reddit for the night, 
  yes i can only describe it as closest to shrooms overall but as the shaman guy was saying to me it 's a medicine and cleansing process so if your body is sick you may well feel very sick . 
  naturally being where i was i 'd been living off a pretty clean and natural diet in the week beforehand but compared to the shrooms i was far more aware of my body the whole time as in it would have made me mentally and physically sick if i had a big mac in my stomach at the time . 
  other than that peru where i went was great , at first i was afraid of all the shit i might find in the jungle and then after the whole spiritual thing i became pretty comfortable about it and ended up tagging along with some americans who were following a pretty well known alternative route back to civilization , funny thing after two weeks with no contact one of their parents reported them missing and we were met by the peruvian search and rescue but then they turned out to be cool and got a free helicopter ride  i can say for sure such a trip wont make any medical condition worse that 's for sure and when it comes to dealing with death and spirituality it certainly is one of the medicines for the soul and it sure shored up a belief in me that life is by no means pointless nor do we just simply die . 
  i guess the only downside is it might leave you questioning a lot of the shit we do in the name of progress on this side of the world and even make you dismayed with the world around you . 
  i say why turn our ass to either side when you can dance with both . 
  well i pretty much did and experienced the same these finnish `` madventures '' guys did on their gonzo travel show : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glopagbd0k8 basically the spiritual , `` everything is connected '' , there must be a god of some type warm feeling most people report , kind of like we somehow only experience time on a linear plane but that there is a separate non linear that is more in the spiritual but we are not normally aware of , then to be more specific i remembered my own birth and first breaths as if it was yesterday like literally `` seeing the light '' set and setting of course is the key thing with these types of experience so the jungle is indeed perfect and getting there is the metal preparation time but only thing i would do different is not to make it all about the drugs as it 's possible to overhype it . 
  if dmt is like crack cocaine this is like really good cocaine in that you will remember the whole experience and it wo n't just be over in 15 mins but naturally wont be as intense but leaves you time to actually process it . 
  i 'd only ever smoked dmt once before doing that so i was kinda like `` oh this is n't nearly as mind altering as i thought '' but at the same time i learned a lot more about myself and got a lot more from it overall which is a good thing . 
   the reason behind that is the imf analysis that came out . 
  and the imf is basically the international financial arm of the usa so that report and it 's timing is not meaningless either, 
  you left out that vat on medicines is being left unchanged at the lowest rate which caught my eye, 
  nope he 's right , i spent way too much money going to live wild in the amazon for a few weeks , getting one with the nature and eventually taking ayahuasca to meet my soul . 
  not exactly the same thing but i 'd sure be interested to check this out, 
  yep , i 'd like to say there is still hope for change but the `` meh slowly becoming germany would n't be so bad '' has turned to `` no way i want to follow in their footsteps '' soon we 'll be having no kids and throwing away our cultural identity to work our entire lives as efficiently as possible as well . 
  yep , i was calling myself a finnish european for a while as well but it 's fair to say the euro has ruined our economy ever so slowly as well . 
  fact is it 's no fun letting germany decide how your economy is best run . 
  we could really do with becoming more compedative as our exports have been falling back in recent years but hey that 's not our decision now . 
  with debt forgiveness and actual money for investment the country . 
  do n't expect to hear about that thought until the western media has it 's day of gloating about the raw deal syriza got . 
  true but at least more and more of us want to pack our bags and quit rather than continue with the charade or have you heard if the true finn 's success . 
  well i say that because i think we are above germany and france and they are not exactly model society 's . 
  importing foreigners instead of giving their own people time and space to have kids is one in a list of many straws but to put it simply i like our own culture just fine and believe in our leaders ability to effectively rule ourselves without some bueraracat shaping our economy to their liking, 
  truth that your country leads an undemocratic quasi debt colony dictatorship too much to handle twice in one day ? 
  yea they did n't seem to care to much about the deal they did with ireland that now has it 's central bank buying government debt . 
  the most stupid thing about this is the eu has no rules if you are a government that does what it 's told . 
  wait is n't that a sort of dictatorship, 
  and yanis did n't break rules , he just said he had to record meetings to keep track of what was said . 
  in any case who established this ` eurogroup ' and gave them these powers to discuss the future of nations under secrecy, 
   delusional wow , all i read is about how the eu and troika are an undemocratic bunch of economic hitmen trying to turn the rest of europe into the new franco german empire and fuck everything about that . 
  they have used every dirty trick in the book to undermine syriza and i will never forget this , anti eu for life now . 
  it 's pretty ridiculous and the media propaganda machine tried to have a go at yanis for recording the meeting on his phone to keep track of what was said/agreed, 
  well it 's not relevant to the current events considering it discusses a pre election greece brooding about the possibility of a yes vote and the author seems positively hard about the prospect of syriza leaving office, 
  terrible and out of date article, 
  that sounds really interesting , reminds me of the almost as infamous irish letters where the ecb was `` strongly urging '' if not demanding them to formally request a bailout . 
  then there is also this weird deal where they broke their own rules letting the irish state collect payments on bonds it then issues back to the government there which breaks their own rules . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlwhelan/2013/02/11/irelands-promissory-note-deal/ just goes to show how much rules mean to different debtors or should i say subjects, 
  you took my examples there before i had time to mention them , smoking and climate change . 
  the latter is the probably the most controversial in our time as it really is divisive among conservatives and progressives and science reflects that . 
  unfortunately it seems ( at least to me ) to cause the scientific community itself to get dirty and start ousting some of the paid climate change deniers http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/21/climate-change-denier-willie-soon-funded-energy-industry look i understand the biggest enemy to science is the dodgy scientists that discredit their good work so there is motivation to weed them out but at the same time in the grey areas that are n't of huge importance like climate change there is less motivation to care about one corrupt scientist and ii fear it will only become more common unless we make it independent of business or get more critical with scientists so they sort out their own garbage . 
  at the end of the say i think they need to be paid better for starters, 
  sorry but it 's been brought up many times in a russian context that people comment saying along the lines of `` look at this guys post history '' it 's obvious what their agenda is and such comments are never treated as personal attacks . 
  are you saying i should report all comments referring to the particular and one directional nature of someones post history as personal attacks from now on ? 
   within reasonable amounts like i said ** within reasonable amounts ** anyway i 'm not advocating for anything , the precautionary principle the eu has adopted is just fine by my standards so i hope that answers your questions . 
  but generally speaking foodstuffs and products which have an impact on ones health over a prolonged period that ca n't be lab tested on humans over a long period , the bad design of a car axle might cause you to have an accident but that could then be easily identified and you could be compensated in full . 
  if i get sick in 20 years and by that time it 's been shown that gmo corn actually gives that specific type of cancer it 's very hard for me to prove i eat that specific corn every day and it caused the problem . 
  given those two examples it should be pretty clear what things should be treated with caution . 
  any further probing questions are just you being a jerk since this sort of `` where is the proofs '' shitposting is all you seem to do on reddit, 
  i 'm not talking about any sort of scientific conspiracy , propel just want to get paid for their work and it 's the private industry jobs proving the science private companies want to see that are first of all more numerous and secondly get paid best . 
  it 's just logic and then when you think how science is just consensus based then you see how it can very easily be a problem . 
  sure , maybe they do n't like that word , i 'm sure it 's ok to highlight the fact 95 % plus of their posting history is devoted to just one specific lobby intensive topic though and it 's the somehow implied derogatory nature of the `` sh ** l '' word that 's the issue here ? 
   name a single thing that has been proven safe . 
  water , air , marijuana . 
  of course within reasonable amounts , too much of anything is dangerous i 'm not a scientist but i would presume via every available toxicology test , devise a scale of `` potential for harmful effect '' instead of just `` well i ca n't find anything bad '' and of course it 's observable effect over time on a small scale before mass introduction . 
  but like i said i 'm spitballing shit that 's not in my field but forcing people who do n't want to be test subjects is not the way to go . 
  eh we just did that via 1 trillion in qe to aid banks and big business , why not 400bn to write off one of the biggest political crisis of the eu ?
