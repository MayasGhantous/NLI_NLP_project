  windows 8 now that 's a challenge, 
  have you sources for any of this , `` had them last summer '' and so on . 
  i 'm trying to read up more on this topic and all of what you are telling me is fresh news to me . 
  yes ** the conversations date from at least january 2014 ** but not the important leaks which were only released recently, 
  source on the starting because afaik these leaks only came out in the past months ? 
   propaganda is being exposed using leaked wiretapped materials that they were illegally recording in the past 7 years . 
  ahh the old government that wiretapped and implicated themselves and somehow the tapes fell into the hands of the opposition just at the perfect time they agree to russia 's pipeline plan and you somehow think russia has a hand in overthrowing them . 
  yea totally , nothing fishy at all here / s  so i am seeing russian bots started to write on this and suddenly macedonia becomes huge geopolitical deal on the internet . 
  distract , distract , distract , * anyone who disagrees with me must be a shill . 
  * time to poison the well guise . 
  ** to ** the right !, 
  , bloody hell if they get any more right wing the uk will be goosestepping in no time . 
  i sense another class war coming thatcher style, 
  dude if you think she can just up and move from sweden to another country you get a job in i hate to say it 's never just that easy here . 
  moving states here usually requires learning another language , selling all your stuff is coomon as moving it is usually prohibitively expensive/less car ownership and there may even be waiting lists for housing , for example you can be on a waiting list over a year to get an apartment in sweden right now so i can see her being very reluctant to just pack and leave . 
  bureaucracy of moving states is also a holding factor , sure nowadays if medical and social welfare benefits travel with you but not all countries are the same and bureaucracy of it is still huge imo . 
  because according to the us and eu they have n't been paying enough `` commitment to democracy '' and we all know what that means  especially when the turkish stream pipeline is being approved by the current government and the west does n't want it . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/russia-macedonia-pipeline-idusl5n0we1lf20150312 i just hope they do n't destabilize and throw their country down the tubes like ukraine did . 
   but yanukovich decided its good idea to sent berkut to beat and shoot people exactly why him actually doing that seems all the more improbable . 
   i dont follow the soap opera here . 
  your better off  and yea he probably does mean that but i 'm not playing ball either . 
  i ca n't imagine how any country or people could treat the elderly and especially veterans like that . 
  so freaking sad thinking what that day must mean for this man :(, 
   oh and look who posted it too eh , the new york times ... or am i missing something ? 
  yep totally putins mouthpiece and not the newspaper of record for the usa / s look the nyt do n't just print business insider clickbait , articles there have more meaning than just the mere words . 
  and visits like that in terms of diplomacy have more meaning than you or i will ever know . 
  do n't forget the us economy is now on the edge of recession with negative growth last quarter and a fraction of one percent predicted next quarter . 
  they can not afford another recession with interest rates still at zero . 
  this is pretty much `` game over now lets get back to business russia '', 
  wow , do n't know how that article slipped by me . 
  from another article about the visit , i almost fell over laughing  lavrov , however , gave his american counterpart a basket of potatoes and a basket of tomatoes , as well as a `` victory '' t-shirt commemorating the 70th anniversary of the soviet defeat of nazi germany . 
  considering how this meeting is being read a diplomatic victory i ca n't help reading `` trololol , trolol '' through the lines here . 
  yea i get it , eastern european who does n't want to believe china plus russia is more beneficial to china than us containment and eventually being surrounded on all borders and putler is literally satan . 
  geopolitics is my hobby and i can only respectfully disagree . 
  here is a great ( and fully sourced and data filled ) article dealing with the myths and reality 's of the china/russia alliance which was a great read , have a look ( or do n't ) and feel free to discuss because i have to say i agree with most points it raises . 
  [ the strategic alignment between russia and china : myths and reality . 
  ] ( http://www.theasanforum.org/the-strategic-alignment-between-russia-and-china-myths-and-reality/ ), 
  you leaving out the fact that china is fast approaching every metric of economic parity with the usa , it 's there on gdp ppp and will soon be the worlds largest economy . 
  i agree with you that currently for the united states , russia is an enemy and china is a potential enemy but for china they are looking to be number 1 and right now the us are sitting there opening stating they want to `` contain '' china . 
  i 'm well aware of the fact china and russia could destroy each other but who wins then ... ? 
  their common enemy does !, 
  just to bring pop culture into this because it is relevant , putin has huge respect and following in china for his patriotic hard-man attitude and xi is capitalizing on this himself by striking up almost a personal friendship so again i do n't see this as a facade on behalf of china , would they go to war for russia , probably not but if they keep increasing ties who knows and if they want to project enough power to get this bipolar world they may just have to form a military pact to get it . 
  [ ( wall street journal ) why russia 's president is ` putin the great ' in china like xi jinping , vladimir putin is seen as a strong leader who is n't afraid to confront the west ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-russias-president-is-putin-the-great-in-china-1412217002 ) basically every single move between china and russia has singled they are growing closer and you want to tell me they will go against each other now ? 
  now i 'm not saying there is going to be a war but china and russia want a bipolar world where power is shared more evenly and they know working together is the way to get it . 
  now about the prospect of war , i do n't believe anyone wants it and i think the idea of nato coming to blows with russia is pretty small but likewise i do n't fear russia in the slightest , we trade with them and economically it 's stupid to ignore you biggest neighbor so i 'd rather keep things the way they are . 
  if russia were to ever attack us thats big time shit right there anyway so nato makes no difference anyway . 
  true that but fighting wars on two fronts has also proved detrimental too but do n't worry if it ever happens because of the distance between the asia and the americas nukes should mean it 's over pretty fast and that right there is one of the more paranoid reasons i 'm glad we ai n't in nato . 
  and now oligarchs and friends of the imf can buy the rest of it up on the cheap as ukraine is forced to sell the bottom mid catastrophe when everything is worth the least . 
  [ european , u.s. energy companies interested in privatization in ukraine ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/263123.html )  ukraine hopes to attract strategic investors with `` long-term vision '' with its planned sale of nearly 300 state-owned assets , the former soviet republic 's economy minister said on friday . 
  yea i totally understand why venice was such an important hub just by it 's geography now, 
  ** first grade subtraction ** q : * if you have three pepsi 's and drink one how much more refreshed are you ? 
  * a : [ ... ... ... ] ( https://youtu.be/hk0bmaummgw?t=13s ), 
   how is china the good cop really ? 
  because to the non western/non aligned sphere which makes up the silent majority of the worlds citizens they do n't really have much of an opinion when it comes to this conflict as your graphic on who supports sanctions goes to show . 
  places like pakistan and much of africa see china as people who come and build stuff in exchange for access and trade as opposed to the usa which usually brings war and weapons . 
  [ is the usa for example promising similar projects around the world such as this in pakistan ? 
  ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/chinas-grand-plan-for-pakistans-infrastructure/ ), 
  never said they stay peaceful but as the us proves in this era you do n't win peoples hearts with war and as far as global opinion is concerned china is perceived as the more peaceful and less interfering global power right now . 
  also you totally ignored my part where i specifically said it 's an advantage for china to use russia as bad cop in their good cop/bad cop relationship . 
  russia comes and kneecaps you while china offers to treat you in their hospital and maybe gives you a job after . 
  well if we know how to keep out mouths shut and let russia be more concerned with the us in the pacific arena we 'll be fine . 
  basically take the us attitude to ww2 where we can lend lease and join at the last minute for the cultural victory . 
  assuming nukes are kept off the table where we all end up fucked . 
   / r/whiterights is a racist subreddit and / r/conspiracy loves talking about how evil jews and immigrants are taking over the world . 
  while i agree on the first , the second group you are just pigeonholing and in fairness who is n't trying to take over the world in one way or another . 
   just take a look at the soviet/chinese relationship in the cold war . 
  they did n't get along very well and nearly went to war because of resources , borders and ideology . 
  true that but then it was all powerful ussr and a different chinese outlook too which was warming to the us after nixon and kissinger visits . 
  we are witnessing ever increasing chinese and russian partnership , with xi and putin presenting an image of an honest friendship to the world at the victory day celebrations and upcoming joint naval drills in the mediterranean , there are chinese naval ships sitting in the black sea as we speak . 
  i see two outcomes , a chinese slow economic takeover of russia making china ever more powerful or a more strategic alliance like we see today with china using russia as it 's bully boy/foreign policy enforcer while presenting themselves as a peaceful alternative hegemony to the rest of the world ( china has big agriculture stakes in ukraine as well you know ) . 
  right now their paths are not diverging anyway, 
  india is n't taken into account and yes i agree as it stands india is the wildcard in the region, 
  it 's so lazy to attack the poster and not the post, 
  it 's no secret , they see a common enemy that want 's to tell them what to do , they are a natural self preservation alliance in the making . 
  here is a good article that discusses this on many levels http://www.theasanforum.org/the-strategic-alignment-between-russia-and-china-myths-and-reality/, 
  how so and how would that realistically make a difference anyway considering a chinese controlled russia would still command the power and resources of russia ? 
  if you allow me to be blunt your comment is based on emotion and politics and makes no sense . 
  in the realm of geopolitics whether you define the alliance as china + russia/china + chinese lebensraum there is little to no difference when it comes to force projection . 
  then developers will just create a plugin to block network delivered ad 's instead of google ad 's . 
  the great thing about net neutrality is once you become as big as google and try to capitalize on that dominance others will develop something better and cheaper to try and take your market share . 
  it 's a self regulating system and that 's why it should never change . 
  the emerging alliance between china and russia becomes a reality with russia junior partner but holding the strings of energy dependence with which china ca n't do without . 
  usa/china + russia becomes the new cold war with hopefully nothing to do with europe . 
  europe becomes more stable economically and politically as the trouble spots of the world move more to the pacific . 
  immigration , refugees and ethnic tensions being the biggest problem for future europe . 
  more anti climatic i 'd say . 
  clearly russia has china 's back in that fight . 
  ugh , old drunk people / r/cringe, 
  well i do n't know about the argument in general but in my mind i meant it more like the government and society is more afraid to admit they could be wrong about a policy that has pretty much defined their nation . 
  right now as a politician changing your mind and saying `` maybe so much emigration was the wrong thing '' would be political suicide . 
  * afraid of being labeled a racist , * afraid to admit a policy that defines a nation and people has failed . 
  more the latter in my mind , it would be political suicide since it 's obvious you ca n't just roll back mass immigration . 
  they 're just afraid to say no at this stage . 
  either that or half the people polled were immigrants themselves, 
   you 've decided that the macedonian government is a great government that is about to be oppressed by the eu/us . 
  no , i 'm warning this guy do n't pull a ukraine or you might get the same result . 
  plus destabilizing your own country with months of protest is not going to help their situation and anyone thinking of doing business there either . 
  the government in democratically elected , why would you want to subvert the democratic process ? 
  i presume you have an opinion on whats going on there ? 
  i do n't get hungary being listed as junk with 76.90 % debt/gdp but yet ireland is ok with 109 % debt/gdp .
