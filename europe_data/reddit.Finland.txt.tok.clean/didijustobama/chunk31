  it 's because they kicked out a bunch of central bankers is n't it ? 
  i seriously do n't know what happened this subreddit that a pro-peace viewpoint is downvoted . 
  th constant spamming of military propaganda is getting way too much as well, 
  for a european sub this guy sure loves to spam his military propaganda . 
  look you probably have all day to talk about the details of this and debate and nit pick the finer points of it since you seem to only talk about the macedonian troubles on reddit but unfortunately i ca n't get drawn into a `` whose going to have the last word on this '' reddit encounter . 
  you seem to want the best for your country that much i can agree with but achieving it by force will only do the opposite and by destabilizing the political climate to the state it 's in now will only have the opposite effect . 
  ukraine should bee recent enough proof you ca n't simply throw out an old boss , put in a new boss and expect things to magically get better , whether you choose to believe it or not the headlines i quoted have shown your country is now in the geopolitical cross-hairs of major powers because of an energy pipeline the eu has demonstrated it does n't want happening . 
  answer me honestly , do you think that pipeline will be built if the opposition comes to power ? 
  will the lack of those gas transit fees be a net positive or negative for decades to come ? 
  i get that there are problems but why all of a sudden they are such a priority , what 's wrong with waiting for elections to throw the government out ? 
  as far as i know you still have free elections in your country , do your compatriots a favor and air your grievances there and if you ca n't wait until then perhaps put your energy into promoting the opposition candidate of your choice democratically . 
  i get that you are angry but with revolutions come counter revolutions and do n't fucking turn your country into the next ukraine and your people as pawns . 
  and maybe try and be open to the fact this espionage shit happens every day so do n't throw the `` conspiracy theory '' buzzword in there , it 's demeaning to those of us who see geopolitics for what they really are . 
  sorry snowfall then , i guess the last two years have been exceptional then ? 
  exactly and just like them all he only cares about his own wallet in the end . 
   are you skeptical about the reason why there are protests ? 
  or are you skeptical about the guilt of the government ? 
  both , the rhetoric coming from the west states they are not happy with the current macedonian government and prefer the opposition which is parroted as more `` western friendly '' then there is the fact the monitoring of citizens can provoke such an apparent outrage when it 's becoming obvious europe and the us are doing the exact same to their citizens anyway . 
  all of which conveniently coincides with this news dated march 12  russia 's stroitransgaz said on thursday it will build a gas pipeline across macedonia , which could eventually be used as part of a route to supply europe with russian gas via turkey . 
   stroitransgaz is owned by gennady timchenko , an ally of president vladimir putin , who was among the first businessmen to be placed under sanctions by the united states in the crimea crisis . 
  a spokesman for stroitransgaz said the sanctions would not hamper the project in macedonia , which is not a member of the european union . 
   the 96.6 km ( 60 miles ) negotino-klecovce gas pipeline will cross macedonia from near the greek border in the south up to the vicinity of the serbian border in the north . 
  stroitransgaz will build 61 km of the link by june 2016 . http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/russia-macedonia-pipeline-idusl5n0we1lf20150312 and guess when the recent `` leaks '' and protests started happening ? 
  it 's pretty freaking obvious what is happeneing but looking at your post history i have a fair idea what your agenda is here , 
  i think the proper metric you should be looking at would be the mean average temperature and not the economic performance which is * supposedly * a result of the weather . 
  i ca n't even ... 
  this guy , the same dude who spams pictures of russian aggression and makes crazy statements on ukraine day in , day out . 
  this guy is literally a eu war hawk and unfortunately such a thing now exists, 
  wtf i have to say beyond skeptical of all this after ukraine especially hearing the rhetoric from the eu and usa and knowing their key position between europe and russia . 
  we all need to keep an open mind on all this unless we want to see another ukraine . 
   `` this continued inaction casts serious doubt on the government of macedonia 's commitment to the democratic principles and values of the euro-atlantic community . 
  continued failure to demonstrate this commitment with concrete action will undermine macedonia 's progress towards eu and nato membership , '' the message reads . 
  [ eu , us ambassadors ** concerned ** with macedonia gov ` t ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/168478/eu,+us+ambassadors+concerned+with+macedonia+gov't#sthash.otusrrs7.dpuf ) [ then my ** concern intensifies ** ] ( http://zurnal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sporedbi-ukraina-makedonija.jpg ) to me this looks like a photo op for regime change in the 21st century social media style . 
  winter happens every year but yet since 2008 some people think it 's a valid excuse for bad performance while negating the fact if it was true it should spur extra growth in the next quarter . 
  yet you never hear q2 reports saying `` this should have been higher thanks to the cold winter and delayed activity '' i do n't mean this as a dig at the us , the fact is they said the exact same last year so at some point you have to say it 's just winter being winter . 
  technically because the earth is a sphere we are the closest eu nation to japan anyway . 
   could have meant billions in expanded trade markets but c'est la vie . 
  american brewers are getting very good at making german style wheat beers ... congrats , if you ask me we should all share our skills but not our jobs . 
  localization over globalization !, 
  we really are the japanese/asians of europe are n't we . 
  edit : [ obligatory weirdness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhreqkrvone ), 
  i guess you have n't watched american sniper yet then, 
  support for an apartheid state based on a guilty conscience is hypocritical and not the logical german thinking i respect them for . 
  do n't let that stop you , i adopted my dog which came from romania . 
  they have so many strays there it 's almost unbearable and most times they are just rounded up and shot . 
  any pet that comes into finland and i presume sweden will of course be vaccinated , chipped and have it 's proper pet passport . 
  while money should n't matter in these things adopting my dog from romania with all that word done cost less than the veterinary prices for the work alone here . 
  overt pride in ones country and history seems to be frowned upon in the eu : / but hey we have `` europe day '' with a few flags flying everywhere i notice . 
  skirts marching at [ 37m48s ] ( https://youtu.be/ge023ihacye?t=37m48s ) then cuts away to putin and the lads having a chuckle ... would love to know the joke . 
  have to say i was only going to watch a bit of this but now i 'm 30 minutes in , it 's pretty fascinating and impressive, 
  as a standup comic i think sometimes in crisis you just have to joke about it . 
  humor is a way to release pent up feelings and i think it 's completly possible to laugh about something but also see the tragedy in it that said let me add some / r/russia ( s ) take on it http://i.imgur.com/ypnd249.png, 
  wow look at them down-votes , is this the ukraine does nothing wrong lets stick our heads in the sand subreddit or what, 
  sorry i did n't know , have they started flat out banning the colour red yet or is it just red flags you ca n't have , what about red t-shirt , will the police take that off me too if i bring it to ukraine ? 
  israel seems to have finally worn it out though ... or at least least nobody is buying the disagree with israel therefore you must hate jews crap anymore . 
  while the new government is becoming more totalitarian by the day i have my doubts about that . 
  eastern europe was an obvious good place to put money since it 's obvious the eu would take them in and start ploughing in development funds but ukraine is a whole other thing and russia has made it pretty clear it does n't want it joining the eu and so on . 
  ironically i 'd say russia is a better place to invest now thanks to the sanction sale . 
  oh finally so this is the sensational propagandist article everyone here is talking about that contains `` several factual errors '' according to the finnish ministry of defense [ defence forces respond to newsweek : `` reservist letter not connected to prevailing security situation '' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/defence_forces_respond_to_newsweek_reservist_letter_not_connected_to_prevailing_security_situation/7967864 ), 
  in other words they are paranoid neo american nutjobs, 
  i 've never met an anarchist who wants to beat the shit out of anyone who does n't agree with them . 
  thanks for the reading . 
  after going through them i can see the logic in releasing dangerous people who would like to kill your enemy 's it seems nobody in the west is officially willing to back or support these claims and after the fake gas attack reports , the fake `` hero kid '' video and so on ii do n't take claims from there without proof anymore . 
  the is oil i was aware of but they are trading that with turkey as well and no doubt anyone who is willing to pay . 
  that 's quite a tale you got there , any sauce per chance ? 
  do n't swedish cops know they are supposed to shoot the homeless not arrest them, 
  sure , could you be a dear and tell yours to maybe no whitewash genocide as well , k ? 
  my grandfather was like that too but with his hobbies like his classic car , wood carving and so on . 
  he never told me how it wanted to go to walmart and greet people however . 
  ahh i 'm too tired to explain now , next time i 'm in the states i 'll ask the person why they are working here when they would be enjoying retirement golfing , fishing , hiking or the normal activities i see retired people doing here , k ? 
   there 's a reason weed has n't been decriminalised in the uk , and that 's because it 's unpopular well it sure does n't help the attitude when you put a near oap journalist ( john snow ) to smoke his first cannabis in an mri machine with a tv crew filming it all . 
  damm that would give me an anxiety attack and i 'm not a novice . 
  actually now that i remember that whole thing was pretty shameless in my view and just when there was a semblance of a move toward decriminalization in the uk . 
  half my family is from ireland so i know the attitudes quite well and i have to say they are changing fast , if you asked me ten years ago , do i think weed will be first legal in ireland or finland i would have said finland without any doubt . 
  nowadays it 's the total opposite and i 've seen the older generation change from `` reafer madness '' to `` bigger problems to worry about '' if there was quantifiable tourism and medical benefit i 'd say people will soon be 50/50 on it, 
  maybe it 's just me but i 'd like think that old lady could just be let retire and enjoy the rest of her time instead of wasting her time making people feel uncomfortable in knowing that 's her job . 
  same goes for those people who wear signs to get around advertising laws , either make it illegal or let them put a sign there but do n't waste somebody 's time making them stand there for minimum wage . 
  i 've been saying it for a long time germany is the usa 's trojan horse in europe . 
  anyway since when do you win a war , take control of a country and let them go about their own thing again , germany ca n't eve get their gold back from the fed . 
  believe me they would n't , i know few regions in europe that smoke as much weed as the british isles and the french . 
  yes they have the whole `` ira going after drug dealers , keeping the streets clean thing '' but weed flies under that radar for the most part afaik, 
  i simply prefer the small chance of an honest smile of a happy worker than forced pleasantry . 
  if someone acts in a forcefully polite manner to me it puts me under pressure to react the same way . 
  plus i think to an extent everyone should be able to act naturally in their work environment , if not how are we ever supposed to tell genuine happiness from forced niceness . 
  put simply there is a reason i have a girlfriend i see every weekend and not an escort . 
  sorry i 'll tell my non existent government to get right on it . 
  ma bear !, 
  you brought yo bong, 
  i like many things about us culture , that said being a worldly travelled guy there is few places i bring up the american `` forced niceness '' and they do n't agree it seems plastic and annoying . 
  just the idea of someone greeting me when go the the supermarket seems like an inefficient waste of a good worker and here am paying for that dude to welcome me, 
  no , my answer is i 'm pretty sure nobody here got round to it yet and i 'm not surprised since we only had elections last weekend and right now have no government yet . 
  the us on the other hand reaffirmed their position on the matter just yesterday, 
  given your history that seems like a brave remark . 
  yea but in that case it 's not like turkeys does n't understand the usa 's real opinion on the matter , a lot of americans do n't understand this but one of the biggest issues people in europe and beyond take with the culture is the this sort of two faced attitude . 
  for example when i 'm in the states the whole `` hi , how was your day , now what can i get you '' attitude everywhere comes off as insincere and borderline annoying as i know you do n't care just serve me and be on your way . 
  i would still argue it would convert more people than violence ever did, 
   seems like finland , along with most of the world , does n't reconize it either . 
  i assume it 's a periphery/small nation thing . 
  ireland , portugal and norway seem to be in the same boat too, 
  yea it 's jut funny you make specific reference to ireland over other eu nations and border nations like france for example,
