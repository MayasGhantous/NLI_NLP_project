  * hostile population with totally different culture and language , this will be an ongoing and opposed occupation and not an annexation . 
  * biggest pr disaster the kremlin ever faces , attacking a neutral country , killing tens if not hundreds of thousands and they were not even a nato threat . 
  * continued resistance to occupations and a country which will continue bombing targets via ied 's and other guerrilla tactics long after the fighting on front lines ends . 
  ** pro invasion ** * geo-politically finland looks like a nice buffer state to put an ocean between russia and the west on the northern front and that 's about it . 
  the biggest defense finland has is that it 's not a threat to russia and in no way could the kremlin ever sell finland as an aggressive state that needs to be dealt with to the population . 
  a war with finland would be so immensely unpopular it would lead to a full blown crisis in moscow . 
  but it will never happen and for sure would lead to major escalation and probably ww3 so i 'm not even going to think about it and neither is russia so calm your tits dear . 
  explain our trade surplus then , anything we want we can have . 
  that is out trade advantage over countries like the usa who import more than they export , they * need * our stuff , we do n't strictly need theirs and certainly not their inferior cars or food . 
  this post gave me a war boner . 
  europe makes all the goods and services we need and if we do n't there there 's a job for somebody . 
  if we need something from the us or china we know how to ask and we do n't need their shit we do n't want forced on us so better off without it i say, 
   40 % male customers 50 % female 10 % both hmm 50 % you say and would be pretty easy to just hang up on the guys, 
   what the hell ? 
  because as a young ** and fit gay guy ** you can make easy money by cruising gay bars ? 
  what the hell , you must be gay to be a male prostitute ?? 
  is it unimaginable that some of these guys are nailing some cougars ? 
  yes , yes , anyone who shows any support for russia or does n't get 100 % on board with the western circlejerk is 100 % a `` sock puppet '' of kremlin . 
  / s grow up , at this point i take up russia 's argument more often than i used to just because of people spouting shit 24/7 . 
  i even noticed house of cards taking on the anti-russia spin last night as well, 
   so many reporters on russia today quitting on air you mean that one reporter who went on a media charade with all the lights on her afterwards , seemed more attention seeking to me . 
  i follow a few journalists who work there independent and not the station itself , abby martin always speaks her mind and i 'm not going to stop watching because someone tells me everything is propaganda which i know for a fact is not true https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zolxrjgibjs, 
  too bad your ad hominem is not going to work on me and i wont just shut up despite your attacks . 
  you would probably just wish i stopped having an opinion at all would n't you . 
  except that statement is not true , point me to this `` russian propaganda '' i post, 
  i do , i 'm just saying i remember the moment geography was suddenly a european thing ( as standard ) instead of a national thing . 
  oh noes , am i being accused of something now . 
  this subreddit has gotten so ridiculous lately , well i simply refuse to be bullied by people like you so you can go lick my finnish member if you think i 'm proving myself to anyone, 
  i ca n't believe i 'm defending the station now but here  i have watched them since the day they were established and it is a pure propaganda channel . 
  no , their reporting is 99 % factual like any network or broadcaster , please send me links to false stories if you think my guesstimate is inaccurate but i 've read and watched quite a few of their us discussion shows along with the max keiser show and it 's simply alternative media that slates the us in ways they would not like to talk about themselves in public . 
  that is referred to as `` spin '' i often watch bbc/al jazera/rt so i can get three perspectives on a single topic and work out for myself who has what stakes where and from that what is the truth in the middle . 
  if you had an interest in seeing through propaganda you would do the same but seems you think the western media stations do n't care to push any narrative and to me that makes your thinking a bit naive . 
  well i still remember the day all our geography books were changed and all of a sudden we learned european capitals and rivers instead of more local stuff . 
   they always flip the coin so that there is only one side . 
  really as i 've seen lots of evidence they try harder than you think to always have guests from both sides and so on . 
  it 's in fact the western side that are often reluctant to appear [ and often when they do it 's as unprofessional as this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie5jk0a1tcm ), 
   going by the uk 's nightmare on nuclear power plant dealings recently , with france 's edf and japan 's hitachi frances tvo were building us one too but it 's only 200 % over budget in both time and cost . 
  despite objection i 'm pretty glad we got russia to construct our next one, 
   europe has been moving away from the u.s. for some time now . 
  oh gawd i wish that was true but have you not seen the trade agreements and the eu lobby groups , we are becoming little america and it 's killing me, 
   when a dictator seems to lose their ability to keep their country stable but gadaffi crushed that little rebellion in no time , he had full control but the us/nato removed him for ( other ) reasons then ? 
  oh look another reddit account which only talks about ukraine ( going by last two pages of post history ) giving us their perspective on the conflict , no propaganda here , no sir ree bob / s, 
  i found it rude an unprofessional for someone in a public ministry no matter what the context . 
  estonia just showed themselves as a bit childish there and plus , by declining to comment they just gave rt free pass to show only one side of whatever story it was in relation to, 
   why would they tweet the response ? 
  because networks normally like to give both sides of the story and explain why one side of a story declines to comment if they do n't respond and when the estonian guy was as immature as this in his response of course they should show him up for it . 
  not everything that does n't fit the perfect ukraine is propaganda , the guy actually seems to be from finland, 
  wow an account that posts on behalf of ukraine non stop that thinks the holocaust did n't happen . 
  not helping the old `` no nazi 's fighting for ukraine '' argument there bud, 
  well i feel the need because i 'm a classical left wing liberal who opposes migration and i have people right now calling me a right winger who hates all muslims . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pvu99/anton_lundin_pettersson_21_chose_his_victims_at/cw9zxe7 my views are literally socialist and line up perfectly with a slavoj zizek, 
  what about people who stab shoppers in ikea , i assume that 's ok too then ? 
   you would find a way to make it about `` the persecution of the white man '' and how all the muslims are evil . 
  when have i ever spake about those topics , i do n't recall ever doing so . 
  it does n't change the fact your comment breaks the subreddit rules and i 've seen tamer ones removed for less . 
  i have many muslim friends and do n't think white people are being persecuted , affirmative actions laws should they exist kinda are going that road but it 's certainly not a viewpoint of mine . 
  sounds like you make up straw-men in your head there mate, 
  what makes you classify this as a terror attack , do you class the ikea murders in the same way ? 
  is there any other archive site than archive.is ? 
  it 's not available from finland thanks to some beef the site owner has with us and i can never be bothered to fire up a vpn just to view a few links . 
   http://i.imgur.com/0unyaqc.png but thanks for the fame , i say that because i said this would happen months ago and i was right . 
  i guess being correct about an obvious cause and effect reaction makes me racist now too / s, 
   i 'm generally left wing , but i disagree the fact you have to state this in advance just goes to show how this subreddit is fostering an opinion that anyone who speaks out against immigration is a far right xenophobe . 
  what has happened to this place, 
  does anyone genuinely enjoy smalltalk ? 
  it 's like political correctness for polite conversation . 
  sorry mate but from the outside it looks more like ireland broke you and the rest followed, 
  there was a great quote regarding the three generation cycle of war or so the theory goes . 
  something like `` my grandfather went to war so his children could go to university , his children went to university so their children could be poets and artists '' i messed up the quote but seems instead of poets and artists we got self deprecating people who do n't believe they should take any pride in what they were given by the generations that went before them . 
  two chapters of a book you ca n't even quote here is your source for a statistic , if you ca n't do better than that i 'm done here, 
   the really funny / ironic / tragic thing about this is that right wing terrorism has killed more people ** in germany in the last ten years ** than islamists terrorist . 
  sure and weighty tv sets have also killed more people by falling on their heads than terrorism in the us over the past ten years . 
  if you zoom out to a european scale there clearly is a problem . 
  i 'd imagine china appreciates the undemocratic and authoritarian nature of the eu . 
  perfect bedfellows, 
  so you 're saying we should n't have democracy ? 
  i do n't even get your point but it sounds like you are making excuses for extremist muslim terror attacks , many of which have nothing to do with their conditions or status but liberal writers making fun of their imaginary idol . 
   and it were the muslims who were first affected by this when their jobs were exported en masse in wake of the 1972 oil crisis . 
  source ? 
   who 's profiting of importing low skilled migrant labor ? 
  who 's fault is it that wages are driven down ? 
  is it muslim worker that drive the wages down ? 
  or is it the person on the top who profits from paying as little as possible for someone 's labor ? 
  yes the guy on top is profiting by getting cheap migrant labor and keeping the proletariat busy with class strife by creating an even lower class below the lower class european who wo n't complain lest be be sent home . 
  do i like it no , is more migrants sucking on welfare going to fix it : hell no, 
  what ? 
  it 's cheap low skilled migrint labour that 's driving wages down and making it harder for hard working european middle and lower class . 
  these people do n't have a culture of unionization or fighting for workers rights either . 
   it should be muslims who are afraid of europeans . 
  if i do the math , extremist muslims have killed more europeans than right win nuts have killed extremist muslims . 
  so no , even your logic does not add up, 
  tor is encrypted to the point nobody knows who 's or what data is passing through your connection . 
  so you ca n't get in trouble for relaying tor . 
  acting as a vpn is just being the middleman knowing what someone is exchanging , tor is like six guys passing a letter with only the address to the next person in the chain on the envelope being the extent of what each person knows about who and what is sending the package, 
  do n't follow this dimwits advice , he uses hola which is a freemium vpn that lets others download child porn or whatever they wish using your own ip and connection as a vpn as you use it . 
  the guy thinks he 's such a clever pants paying for things legit without even knowing he would be better off torrenting thanks to the botnet he just installed on his computer to access us netflix, 
   find one that does n't . 
  it 's not hard . 
   you 'll have no trouble using hola for the purposes of netflix . 
  enjoy the letter someone sends you through your door for someone else pirating shows on your internet connection .
