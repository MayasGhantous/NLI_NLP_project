i would say that putin is mad , but he is more likely trying to write himself to history as one of the big guys . 
  the savior of the soviet russia , who returned russia to `` its place '' . 
  our luck is that china uses russia 's situation to their own favour . 
  next years with russia are going to be very full of tension . 
  the `` submarine '' in the sweden 's waters was just media trick to move media 's eye from ukraine . 
  fighters and bombers training to for attack strike all around europe is the same trick . 
  now we just wait the full scale attack from the `` separist forces '' . 
  have you noticed , that there is n't as many russian commentators in these threads anymore . 
  let 's see what happens next . 
  are the russian 's just protecting themselves from the west if the crisis in ukraine goes too deep . 
  pictures from russian supermarket in st. petersburg . 
  in short , the food sanctions are finding their ways to russian consumers . 
  fish , chicken , meat products and vegatables are already almost sold out . 
  at the moment , i think that russians would be far better option than the economic immigrants . 
  with russians we would share a lot more common values and they are n't over represented in our crime statistics as the main groups ( middle-east , north africa ) of our asylum seekers . 
  i am dreaming of a fucking cold winter and lot of snow . 
   how we can walk in the winter for 1 km to get food ? 
  they really have chosen poorly if they ca n't move during the winter . 
  we have about 400 - 500 000 unemployed people and the amount is going to be after this year around 440 - 540 000 . 
  we have a workforce of 3 000 000 at the moment so one of six does n't have a job . 
  amount of employed people is 2 523 000 ( august 2015 ) in a nation 5 400 000 people . 
  30 000 asylum seekers that are approved to stay , will cost us almost 400\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ per year . 
  note : only 3 % of registered asylum seekers in finland are from syria . 
  biggest group of seekers are from irak 32 % , because we did saw that irak was unsafe location until this week . 
  southern irak is now seen as safe place . 
  it still is a mystery that if we really can deport anyone back there . 
  the second largest group is from somalia 23 % , because we ca n't or wo n't deport them back . 
  it is n't seen as safe and somaliland does n't want these people . 
  edit . 
  did you know that some of somalis that have a safe place in finland do send their kids to somalia if they come too familiar with finnish mindset and culture .

  it is also [ statistically ] ( http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf ) proven that immigrants from middle-east and northern-africa are over presented in finnish crime statistics . 
  also these group 's are hard to employ and only 50 % of unemployed group members will get a job . 
  eventough they get the same resources as immigrant from anywhere else ( p. [ 34 ] ( http://www.tem.fi/files/40368/maahanmuuttajien_tyollistyminen.pdf ) table 9 . 
  ethnicities on right side , on down years in finland and on right employed people of the ethnicities . ) . 
  on p. [ 58 ] ( http://www.tem.fi/files/40368/maahanmuuttajien_tyollistyminen.pdf ) there are tables 20 . and 21 . 
  these tables show how the people from different regions and countries have employed themselves after government courses ( 20 . ), 
  for unemployed or after state sponsored employment . ( 21 . ), 
  ( on both tables you can see on the right side employment rate and at down is months from the course or sponsored job . ), 
  both these groups have a lot of uneducated people with big families , young children and idea of mother staying at home . 
  what will make a little difference . 
  on the crime [ statistics ] ( http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf ) ( p. 22-23 ) there is also table , that shows by language or nationality what are the employment rate 's of all people in that group and of men in that group . 
  on the left side are the nationalities or languages spoken by the group . 
  dark blue is the employment rate of all the people in that group and light blue is the men . ), 
  well , in finland we do n't have the money for it . 
  we 're making huge cut backs to all our services . 
  our minister has told that the asylum-seekers are costing to us 13 200 $ / per person / year if they get the asylum . 
  does n't anyone else feel like this ? 
  it 's a fucking [ trap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4qzpbcfia ) !, 
  the first one was taken by security and for the second one only slapping and kicking before another security personal arrived . 
  http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2015/09/06/turkish-cop-who-found-boy-tells-of-tragedy.html found the picture . 
  i have seen a lot of material being moderated down that does n't support the immigration and will bring more light how the media is downplaying facts for their own agenda . 
  yesterday there was two pictures published were it was shown that ~ ~ greek ~ ~ turkish police moved the drowned syrian child to the famous spot for better photos . 
  apparently he landed on , different , more remote spot on the beach between rocks . 
  a little bit . 
  hakkapeliitta was a unit of finnish soldiers in the swedish army . 
  they got their name from the battlecry hakkaa p\u00e4\u00e4lle . 
  here is a [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) page about hakkapeliittas, 
  this song gives me always chills . 
  jaegars march [ j\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rinmarssi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7b8e2lgly4 ) . 
  there is subtitles on the video and here is link to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4ger_march ) page . 
  there has been a little discussion on time to time that we should make [ finlandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3jj0vdln-u ) for our national hymn . 
  swedish translation by joel rundt . 
  english translation by keith bosley . 
   finland , behold , thy daylight now is dawning , the threat of night has now been driven away . 
  the skylark calls across the light of morning , the blue of heaven lets it have its way , and now the day the powers of night is scorning : thy daylight dawns , o finland of ours !, 
   finland , arise , and raise towards the highest thy head now crowned with mighty memory . 
  finland , arise , for to the world thou criest that thou hast thrown off thy slavery , beneath oppression 's yoke thou never liest . 
  thy morning 's come , o finland of ours !, 
  well , finland needs 3 more asylum facilities a week to cope with the flow of asylum seekers . 
  we get only 1000 persons / week . 
  what the actual fuck !, 
  this is just so fucked up . 
  we really need pour money to the camps and send un forces to syria for making safe zones . 
  this ca n't continue without huge amount of drowned people . 
  i was just a week ago there . 
  our hotel was about 200m from the railwaystation in question . 
  did n't see or hear anything , because we did n't visit that direction . 
  i was quite shocked as i saw the images from there . 
  wow , wtf germany are you doing ? 
  before taxes it is about 3200 $ and after taxes it is around 2100-2300 $ . 
  it is n't a lot , but still it is amount of money that someone will get as wage from a entry job . 
  those situations were way different . 
  karelians were finnish as everyone else at the time and they spoke the same fucking language and share the same basic culture . 
  karelia was also the one of the wealthiest part of finland . 
  so they really did n't come for better living conditions to start everything over . 
  sweden did take finnish refugees , but those were mainly children , under 12 years , and the children did came back when the war was over . 
  edit . 
  typos and better sentences . 
  if i want to come to iceland , what is the best time of year to do it ? 
  cool !, 
  and that 's my point . 
  they have shot it straight away when the plane crossed from syria 's airspace to turkish airspace . 
  but why there is n't a single warning about using force against the airplane ? 
  or a warning that they 're are in turkish airspace ? 
  you have to remember , that the same food is provided to our kindergarden and schools . 
  so it is n't anything that we would n't eat ourself . 
  we wont step it up , because politicians and their networks are making money out of the immigration . 
  goverment is paying 43 $ / day/person for companies to provide housing , food and medical services to asylum seeker . 
  there a lot of companies wanting to build up new centers for asylum seekers .
