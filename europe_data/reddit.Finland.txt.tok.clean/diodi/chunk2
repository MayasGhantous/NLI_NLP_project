  he made me feel like he was trying to endanger the aircraft . '' http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/caped-man-holding-a-toblerone-like-a-sword-on-a-plane-told-the-pilot-to-fly-to-sochi-9270132.html, 
  yes . 
  the graph shows the net wealth ( net wealth = wealth - debt ) . 
  us has huge gdp per capita , but it 's distributed differently . 
  u.s. trails at least 15 oecd countries in median wealth http://www.middleclasspoliticaleconomist.com/2012/07/us-trails-at-least-15-oecd-countries-in.html, 
  what would be the endgame ? 
  finland do n't have significant russian speaking minorities like baltic states or ukraine . 
  fake elections and that kind of bullshit would not work in finland . 
  finns have very high will to defend their country with weapons . 
  in polls roughly 80 percent of finns support resistance by weapons , even with an unknown outcome [ 1 ] . 
  for comparison , only 5.4 % of people in southeast ukraine would be willing to take up arms against threats from russian forces [ 2 ] . 
  finland is also eu country . 
  what part of `` let 's have all trade with eu stopped and our foreign assets frozen and hope that they greet us as liberators at the end ? ', 
  sounds like good idea ?

  baltic states are really hard to defend from initial surprise attack . 
  there is no defensive depth . 
  the reason why baltic states are safe is nato 's article 5 and eu 's [ mutual defense clause ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/mutual_defence_en.htm ) . 
  there is no way russia could come up as winner or propaganda could spin collapsed economy as a good thing . 
  russia ca n't hope to keep the baltic states and have any relations with eu or nato member states . 
  it would be hot war all over the globe until russia retreats or nato ceases to exist . 
  even after the retreat , russia would have to pay huge war reparations to get its freezed assets and the assets of putin 's millionaire and billionaire friends . 
  putin is cynical realist . 
  he fucks with ukraine because he knows ukraine is weak and alone and he can pay the price . 
  if putin decides to mess with baltic states , it happens trough violent non-state actor sponsorship . 
  starship troopers is classic . 
  it 's in the reading list like i said . 
  www.amazon.com/starship-troopers-robert-a-heinlein/dp/0441783589/ http://navyreading.dodlive.mil/files/2012/11/cno_reading_list_2012_small.pdf, 
  it may be in the reading list , because officers need their propaganda too . 
  that 's far from being textbook being studied . 
  starship troopers is in the reading list for u.s. chief of naval operations professional reading program . 
  brzezinski 's '' `` the grand chessboard '' gives much better rationale of why russia is doing what it 's doing . 
  unlike brzezinski , dugin is not in any way involved in government or taken seriously as geostrategist . 
  he is just building moral and ideological narrative to russians . 
  russia is not competing as much with france or germany as it is with us . 
  the competition is more [ between us and russia over eurasia and ukraine is the pivot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25ui9d/why_france_insists_on_going_ahead_with_selling/chkxw5m ) . 
  i was not talking about the ship sale . 
  i was questioning their willingness to defend ukraine in general . 
  eu countries could take the hit and pressure russia hard , but they do n't want even slight inconvenience to defend ukraine . 
  france exports to russia seem to be 1.85 % of all exports . 
   does france want to provide armaments to a country with a very poor human rights record at home \u00ddes . 
  of course . 
  human rights play the role in media when things have to be justified , but international relations are very cynical underneath the headlines . 
  france or any western nations will gladly sell arms to dictators in saudi arabia , bahrain , kazakhstan , etc. 
  if the bad guy is in our camp , many bad actions will be forgotten . 
  russia is not in the western camp but money is just too good . 
  of course russia has no right . 
  but what democratic country would be willing to take even 1 % cut to their gdp for ukraine ? 
  willingness of the western countries to erect sanctions seems to be function of their trade with russia . 
  international politics is about countries advancing their own interests . 
  and russia just has more interest in ukraine than western countries . 
  even the people in ukraine do n't seem to be willing to die for their country [ 1 ] . 
  ukraine has been weak and divided over a decade . 
  strong prey the weak . 
  what would make southeast ukrainians take up arms ? 
  while the attack took the west by surprise , there is nothing surprising in the russian determination to fight over ukraine . 
  controlling ukraine one way or another is fundamental for russian geopolitics and has noting to do with putin being a dick ( yeltsin and gorbachev had same ideas about crimea and ukraine ) . 
  now is the last time for russia to act . 
  it either takes what it can , or ukraine will fall into the western sphere of influence forever . 
  baltic states are in the nato and russia has lost them for good . 
  russia can only use them as pawns to get what it really wants . 
  here is what zbigniew brzezinskin wrote in his book [ the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives , 1998 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_grand_chessboard )  * the states deserving america 's strongest geopolitical support are azerbaijan , uzbekistan , and ( outside this region ) ukraine , all three being geopolitically pivotal . 
  indeed , kiev 's role reinforces the argument that ukraine is the critical state , insofar as russia 's own future evolution is concerned . 
  * ...  ... * ukraine , a new and important space on the eurasian chessboard , is a geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform russia . 
  without ukraine , russia ceases to be a eurasian empire . 
  russia without ukraine can still strive for imperial status , but it would then become a predominantly asian imperial state , more likely to be drawn into debilitating conflicts with ... however , if moscow regains control over ukraine , with its 52 million people and major resources as well as its access to the black sea , russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state , spanning europe and asia . 
  ukraine 's loss of independence would have immediate consequences for central europe , transforming poland into the geopolitical pivot on the eastern frontier of a united europe . 
  * the assumption that russia is equally interested with confrontation with eu or nato countries is absurd . 
  france and germany know that this is part of the larger geopolitical competition between us and russia over eurasia . 
  what is politically possible for china is not politically possible for eu country . 
  it 's good for germany but bad for europe as a whole . 
  after all you wrote ( you even mentioned china ) , you should be able to figure out why germany has current account balance problem and why it 's not a good thing . 
  the euro 's three crises http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202012/2012a_shambaugh.pdf, 
   unless one or more countries decided to intentionally devalue their own currency to pursue an export-lead growth policy like china has done for many years . 
  that 's how you continuously export more than you import w / your own free-floating ( well , managed float in this case ) currency . 
  everyone agrees that this is not good thing and it can lead to trade wars . 
  we have this `` not good thing '' within eurozone and germay is in the position of china . 
   because exports are a real cost for a nation , http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/current-account-balance-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html, 
   any country can devalue their currency to any arbitrary degree they like euro is floating relative to other currencies so exports within eurozone and other areas is roughly even . 
  the problem is internal to the eurozone countries . 
  big currency zones like u.s. have mechanisms that automatically balance economic differences between different states ( automatic fiscal transfers , people moving relatively easily ) . 
  eurozone does not have those things , it 's very far from optimum currency area . 
  if all eurozone countries had their own floating currencies , their values would reflect their economic power and there could be no long term imbalances in exports . 
  for germany the benefits of the eurozone are huge . 
  the value of euro is weighted sum of the eurozone economies and it 's artificially low for germany and artificially high for most others . 
  it 's estimated that german gdp grows 0.5 percentage points more in euro . 
  that 's at least 18 billion per year . 
  we have the best statisticians !, 
  there is this concept called optimal currency region . 
  for currency region to work well , it needs to have : 1 . capital mobility ( eurozone has this ) , 2 . labor mobility ( people move from places with bad economy to places with better economy ) , 3 . similar business cycles ( each country has recessions and booms at the same time ) , 4 . automatic risk sharing ( for example common fiscal policy like in us where federal benefits even out the downturns in states that are not doing well ) . 
  eurozone has only capital mobility and it 's very suboptimal currency region . 
  when countries that have differently structured economies than the biggest economy ( germany ) go out of the sync with germany , they will have worse time than without euro . 
  on the other hand germany benefits from this . 
  euro has value that reflects the sum of the economies in eurozone . 
  from german viewpoint euro is weaker than it should be and it helps german exports . 
  for most other countries euro is stronger than it should be and it harms their exports . 
  to solve this issue , eurozone must either dissolve or integrate more strongly . 
  current situation ca n't last forever . 
  i do n't know what would be the best solution , but it looks like eurozone will end up having common fiscal policy in some way or another .
