  euroarea is very suboptimal currency area . 
  only criteria that euroarea fulfills is capital mobility . 
  it lacks labor mobility , price and wage flexibility , automatic fiscal transfer mechanisms , has dissimilar business cycles . 
  it 's impossible to continue having common monetary policy and separate fiscal policies . 
  we have to choose between more integration ( common fiscal policy ) and less integration ( giving up euro ) . 
  country where organized crime is integrated into society . 
  organized crime runs companies with high visibility ( sis and vis ) and works with the police and justice system . 
  that 's because he is in the middle of the process of dealing with the issue . 
  if he would say that military involvement is out of the question , russians would have much easier decision making process and upper hand in negotiations .

  * ... then remembers that finland is not technically scandinavia , lowers the knife and says ` your 're dammn right !, 
  if i did n't miss anything , biggest trust is finland to finland : 3.69 . 
  germany has less than < 90 transport planes ( in fact , germany has leased planes from russians to move their troops around ) . 
  german air force has no tankers for in-flight refueling capability . 
  the amount of sorties they could fly to baltic countries or ukraine would be limited . 
  ukraine or baltian countries would be lost and forward bases taken during those weeks when germans would mobilize . 
  there is not enough ready forces in europe to do area defense anymore . 
  germany needs force projection to protect ukraine , baltic states etc. 
  cold war is long gone and germany and other european countries have reduced their readiness . 
  even such small event like libya was too much for non-us nato countries . 
  us had to provide 80 % aerial refueling and provide aerial bombs , because allies where running out . 
  germany can still defend germany . 
  russia has no logistics to attack germany by land and germany do n't have logistics to attack russia ( unless us provides it ) . 
  u.s. defense secretary gates warned that nato is facing `` collective military irrelevance '' , because there is only one significant participant in the military actions . 
  homicide rate in finland : 2.2 homicide rate in united states : 4.8, 
  this is not propaganda towards finland . 
  the goal seems to be to spread false sentiments and ideas about finnish-russian relations to foreign news agencies and people . 
  finnbay has lots of normal content and it 's not so easy to detect that it skews up things unless you can understand finnish news sources . 
  and discussion in / r/finland is [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/finland/comments/22eqo8/russian_infowar_in_finland_the_source_of_all_the/ ), 
  somehow we have good rankings in education , [ global competitiveness ] ( http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2013-2014 ) , press freedom , [ corruption ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results ) etc. 
  but we totally suck where it really matters : eurovision song contest ( except for that one time when stopped trying , said fuck this shit \\ m / , and united all the metalheads in europe ) . 
   perhaps it 's just not happening in a way you like . 
  it 's not about liking or disliking . 
  the question is if there is enough labor mobility to balance instabilities created by common currency . 
  there clearly is not . 
   no thanks . 
  and i 'll be likely voting against that for the foreseeable future . 
  exactly . 
  there is no solidarity among eurozone countries . 
  the solution for problems created by common currency is to either have common fiscal policy or to exit euro . 
  currently we are in limbo with common monetary policy and independent fiscal policy without proper transfer mechanisms . 
  solidarity and common destiny are additional criteria for currency area . 
  eu clearly lacks it . 
  unity has been forced to eu citizens faster pace than they are willing to accept . 
   and that scenario should happen because ... ? 
  ... finland does not have independent monetary policy . 
  germany is the biggest economy in eurozone and german economy sets the interest rates . 
  if finland has boom while germany is in regression , low interest rates inflate bubble in finland . 
  when things change and germany has boom , ecb increases interest rates making finnish recession deeper . 
  you just have to [ compare sweden and finland to see how it can happen . 
  ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/the-euro-curse/ ), 
  movements of goods has happened somewhat but eu countries lack homogeneous preferences for goods and this limits the movement . 
  eu is trying to harmonize products with standards and people everywhere are complaining . 
  there is not enough labor mobility across the region . 
  polish and estonian people working in finland or sweden are good start but not big enough to change things . 
  if young spaniards start moving to germany in huge numbers and settle there , we are talking . 
  not very likely though . 
  we are missing : 1 . labor mobility , 1 . an automatic fiscal transfer mechanisms ( common fiscal policy and taxation for example , not just emergency measures ) 2 . similar business cycles ( boom in germany while finland descends into recession would put finland into same position as spain very fast ) . 
  i do n't think these two can be separated . 
  the point i was trying to make that in eu economic decisions often done in political reasons that are not economically justifiable . 
  for example , eurozone was mainly political endeavor . 
  economists warned that eurozone would fulfill only one criteria for optimal currency area ( free movement of capital ) and that happened . 
  so , when krugman makes economic argument and takes the eu politicians in face value , what he predicts is not exactly happening . 
  if eu would follow strict discipline and ecb would stay strong , eurozone would be no more . 
  now when imf and others have turned their coat on austerity , it seems that eu countries are gradually implementing policies that allow eu to limp forward . 
  from the pundits who write opinion pieces , [ he is the one that is worth listening . 
  ] ( http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/130485/claim-krugman-is-top-prognosticator-cal-thomas-is-the-worst/ ) i think that paul krugman does not understand european politics , but he understands european economics . 
  his euro breakup predictions did not happen because eu leaders give up inch by inch when backed to corner instead of standing behind their statements . 
  eurozone problems are still exactly same as they were in 1988 when krguman wrote his [ the euro : beware of what you wish for ] ( http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/euronote.html ) . 
  his question `` but how do you run a common currency without a common government ? '', 
  is still open and unsolved . 
  eu is jumping from crisis to crisis and doing fiscal transfers when faced with reality ( = what common government does automatically ) but is not committing to common fiscal policy permanently . 
  there is no much evidence backing up the theory that austerity would help in downturn and he says is very vocally . 
  i think that paul krugman does not understand european politics , but he understands european economics relatively well .

  better headline : ## nordic correspondent of ft eyes growing russian presence in finland with apprehension in the article he gets no support for the worry and used old stereotypes to make the point . 
  russian business presence is very marginal in finland . 
  the presence of russian money is more significant in britain . 
  one ex-nokia vp told me that the main problem with maemo/meego was the fast development pace that was not good fit if the goal of releasing the phone . 
  the software was most of the time changing , buggy and documentation was lacking or nonexistent . 
  when you plan to release the phone , many things have to be freezed and documented so that people outside the main project can finish their stuff and write drivers etc. 
  in other words , there was problems with slow middle management and meego project did not have those problems . 
  it had the opposite problem . 
  symbian was outdated , but you could actually release phone with it . 
  i have heard that when finnish tv was broadcasting emmanuelle bus-loads of people came from the southern estonia to see their first erotic movie . 
  you ca n't make open fire without permission from the owner , but you can use kerosene stove like most campers do . 
  ** after ** media reported it . 
  these actions tell how democracy and public opinion works in sweden . 
  there was no way they could defend these records , so the easiest way out is to do the right thing and turn it to prosecutors before public pressure towards politicians grows too high and they start sacking people starting from the top . 
  that 's only because sweden is full of sad croatian bus drivers . 
   or are there other factors beside monetary policy you blame ? 
  finland is part of eurozone . 
  finland does not have monetary policy anymore .
