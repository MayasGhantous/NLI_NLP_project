they are also the most educated party in finland . 
  sure , but what education ? 
  the greens are anti-nuclear so that ca n't be it . 
  i 'm genuinely surprised that seemingly normal people have started voting for the greens . 
  what happened ? 
   highly educated voters you do n't need an education to be an unemployed artist . 
  sure , the entire cultural identity and linguistic rights to use your mother tongue in your native country is a small thing . 
  see also : netherlands , belgium , switzerland , spain , ireland , scotland , sweden , baltics , etc. 
  are you saying finland too joined the emu based on bogus accounting ? 
  japan is a neighboring country to russia and thus news agencies in japan are surely following russian developments . 
  of course , it 's easy to be a critic , so could you instead suggest where we should be getting news about russia ? 
  just fyi , i 've never heard of japantimes either . 
  first winter is n't even over, 
  which has nothing to do with sweden . 
  `` swedes '' in finland are not swedes . 
  they 're finlandswedes , and if you do n't know that as a person supposedly from finland then why would anyone join a discussion with someone who ca n't read or grasp simple concepts . 
  however , it seems you 've confused yourself and stopped talking about the swedish era when the two countries were one , and you are now talking about the swedish-speaking population in finland which is completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand . 
  such is the problem with anecdotal evidence ... having tried both alko and systemet i would rate them the same . 
  systembolaget has a larger selection 18 000 vs. 6 000 , but this is to be expected since they have almost double the market ( population ) : 10 million in sweden vs 5.5 million in finland . 
  revenue 2016 : swe : 2.8 billion fin : 1.1 billion, 
   while systembolaget is a genuinely great retailer with excellent service and a wide range of products in all shops , the same ca n't be said about alko . 
  haha , what . 
  probably the biggest argument for keeping alko is how they blow most foreign alcohol retailers out of the water with their excellent service . 
  not sure of abloy locks are made here anymore either ... 
  finland is a strong b2b country . 
  a dude and a scoundrel is not the same thing . 
  however , the [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/j%c3%a4tk%c3%a4 ) `` article '' on it also has the scoundrel meaning :  ( colloquial , offensive ) a man whom the speaker wants to be considered as a scoundrel or a bastard, 
  is ... is that all ? 
  [ get on our level , svampgermans .

  ... in modern slang . 
  the archaic word means lumberjack ( tukkij\u00e4tk\u00e4 ) , or in old slang a dockworker ( satamaj\u00e4tk\u00e4 ) . 
  in this case dockworker since it 's the western harbor . 
  does your data analyze child mortality from 1938 when the maternity package was implemented and the first decades when the change from high mortality to low mortality took place ? 
  the package had the biggest impact in the early days . 
  times were very different in the the poor agrarian young nation of finland . 
   pack could be used as a cot as poorest homes did n't always have a clean place for baby to sleep  1949 : income testing removed , pack offered to all mothers in finland - if they had prenatal health checks ** [ incentive that pushed mothers towards health care professionals ] ** according to statistics finland :  in 1936 , 40 per cent of children dying under the age of one died from birth injuries , developmental defects or innate weakness . 
  many children also died from pneumonia , diseases and violence . 
  nowadays only a few per mille die at the age of under one , and the most common cause of death for children aged under one is inborn malformation . 
  infectious diseases are very rare causes of death among under one-year-olds . 
  * http://www.stat.fi/til/ksyyt/2010/ksyyt_2010_2011-12-16_kat_007_en_001.gif  in 2010 , 138 children ( infants ) died under the age of one . 
  fifty per cent of children dying under the age of one died during their first week of life and two thirds during the first four weeks of life . 
  perinatal mortality ( deaths during the first week and stillborn ) was 4.1 per thousand births . 
  the figure has been falling from the beginning of the 1980s to nearly one half . 
  in 2010 there were 17 cot deaths .

   the rankings are based on six factors - per capita gross domestic product , ** healthy life expectancy , freedom , generosity , social support ** and absence of corruption in government or business . 
  oh look , now that i bolded different parts , a completely different message comes across . 
  i would sure be happier if i lived in the slum , my family had to sell their assholes for drug money and i die at 22 when my gang gets killed in a ~ ~ drive-by ~ ~ donkey ride-by shooting from our competing gang !,

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/promiscuity#global_studies  in 2008 , a u.s. university study of international promiscuity found that finns have had the largest number of sex partners in the industrialized world, 
  holy shit . 
  not progressive enough with a heterosexual couple ? 
  the main point of the party is defending the swedish language and culture of swedish speaking finns . 
  the reason their views are all over the map is simply because the members have a mix of political views and are united under one umbrella party . 
  it has traditionally been known as a liberal , right-of-center party , but it seems the newcomers are more red . 
  many municipalities have had a hard time finding candidates and so they are turning to university students interested in politics - in svenskfinland typically the more redgreen persons . 
  does n't typically count as eastern europe though . 
  so you complain about the circle jerk and then whip it out and start jerking semantics ? 
  third wave feminism / = equal rights and treatment for men and women, 
   by that definition of `` universal suffrage '' , the us would not really achieve it until 1965 because that was when the voting rights act was signed into law , protecting all citizens ' right to vote regardless of race . 
  alright , cool . 
  my bad .

  darude is definitely more famous and is in fact still active .

  your empire spent more time and interest on gold and riches instead of educating your people . 
  so what , you now have an ignorant people but at least you 're rich , right ? 
   nikolay bobrikov  assassinated  june 1904 , helsinki , finland, 
  being an empire does n't mean you take care of your people . 
  the people who , lacking education , will be illiterate and ignorant . 
  i 'm guessing this is the reason . 
  white collar workers have a bigger need to exercise to stay well .
