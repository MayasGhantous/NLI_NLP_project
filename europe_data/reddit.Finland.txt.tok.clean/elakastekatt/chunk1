why ? 
  why is that the point ? 
  in my opinion the point of the whole justice system is to minimize the impact of crime on the citizens . 
  making prisons as unpleasant as possible does nothing for reaching that goal . 
  the goal for the prison system should be twofold : primarily : rehabilitate offenders so that they can once again function as normal members of society . 
  having the prisons be at least somewhat pleasant is a ** very ** important part of this . 
  another hugely important part is educational opportunities . 
  secondarily : house the fairly small proportion of ( violent ) offenders that are essentially impossible to really rehabilitate . 
  even for them their existence should be made somewhat comfortable since the goal is ** not ** to punish them but to protect other citizens from them . 
  absolutely necessary for the future . 
  with ever increasing automation comes a greater need to properly tax the richest and distribute the resources for example in the form of basic income . 
  that is much more difficult to do for individual countries since such people can easily just move into another country . 
  the european union together would be big enough to do it . 
   pre-martial sex is deeply taboo indeed . 
  in most of the world sex is only acceptable after combat but in the west we do it ritually before engaging in battle . 
  first of all , finland is not really socialist . 
  secondly , how do you explain the difference between finland and sweden ? 
  sweden 's economy is doing very well despite similar taxation and strong social security . 
  only if you look at freedom from a very narrow perspective , that of negative liberties . 
  if you include positive liberties in your definition of freedom then at least a part of society becomes about guaranteeing those liberties to individuals that might not have them otherwise .

  i know . 
  that 's one of the two i mentioned that are currently being built or planned . 
  but since building has n't started yet we ca n't know about any delays yet either . 
  they are in no rush about decommissioning current nuclear power plants . 
  they generally oppose building new ones though , but that is unlikely to come up very soon since current projects have gone very , very badly . 
  there 's unlikely to be much interest by companies to build another one after the two that are currently being built are finished . 
  if they are finished . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant unit 3 was supposed to be operational in 2010 . 
  the current estimate is 2018 . 
  current cost estimate is over $ 8.5 billion . 
   i do n't recall seeing stem educated having fancy for greens or for the left in finland . 
  not for the left , sure . 
  but for the greens , most definitely . 
  let 's take otaniemi voting district from espoo to use as an example . 
  since aalto technical university is situated there , the vast majority of people living in the district are stem students . 
  the greens received 39 % of the vote there . 
  the greens have the highest portion of employed people among their supporters . 
  the finns have the highest portion of unemployed . 
  very easily . 
  just use per capita statistics like they have used here . 
  wikileaks is an entirely unreliable source . 
  wikileaks `` confirming '' something is like north korea saying their citizens have the highest living standard in the world . 
  it 's simply not to be trusted . 
   a non-labor related cash grant , such as an ubi , would almost certainly reduce the amount of labor an individual is willing to provide you have to compare it to the current system though . 
  right now it 's not beneficial for you to accept part time work if you 're unemployed . 
  you will earn around the same amount of money . 
  ubi would fix that . 
  accepting part time work would become beneficial for unemployed people . 
  that 's total bullshit . 
  criticising the government happens all the time in finland by both media and private citizens . 
  there is no way you can get prosecuted just for criticism . 
   trump is calling out politicians , the elite he pretends to be calling out `` the elite '' . 
  in reality , he 's the very definition of plutocratic elite , much more so than any of his opponents . 
  the only thing he has done to earn his wealth was happening to be born to the right parents . 
  no ordinary junkie is anywhere near as much a scum as a neo-nazi . 
  you 're one bad troll / straw feminist . 
  not necessarily . 
  there are some examples of muslim women marrying non-muslim men without anyone converting . 
  for example , afghani-finnish politician nazima razmyar is married to a finnish christian man . 
  another finnish politician , ben zyskowicz , who is jewish , is married to a finnish tatar muslim woman . 
  that 's complete bullshit . 
  while there were some belgian investments into infrastructure in the congo , you 're really exaggerating it . 
  furthermore , there are some things that are considerably more important than physical infrastructure when it comes to long term development . 
  mainly healthcare and education . 
  let 's take china as an example . 
  while during mao 's rule china 's physical infrastructure remained really shitty , they did make great improvements in literacy/education and eventually healthcare . 
  that is what allowed china to start its incredible economic growth once their economic policies improved after mao 's death . 
  congo on the other hand had less than 100 people ( iirc ) with tertiary education at the time of independence . 
  in a country of 16 million . 
  let 's make a comparison . 
  * china : shitty infrastructure + decent healthcare and education -  great economic growth * congo : decent infrastructure ( which i still think you 're overestimating ) + shitty healthcare and education -  low economic growth unlike you seem to claim , belgium really screwed over congo by not educating the native populace . 
  belgian infrastructure investment was mainly to extract natural resources but that is completely useless if they leave behind no one who knows how to effectively use it . 
  ohh , that 's not what i meant !, 
  sdp is definitely centre-left . 
  what i meant that among young people anyone who leans centre-left votes for the greens , not sdp . 
  sdp 's voter base is by far the oldest of all parties in finland and it has nearly zero support among people younger than about 35 . 
   the problem is that even these people ca n't take their personal serious . 
  i do n't understand what that means . 
  i 'm not as familiar with the greens in germany but in finland they have found a sizeable niche among mainly young-ish and urban people by focusing on issues such as education and science . 
  also by being the only centre-left social liberal party . 
  in the case of anyone younger than 35 or so , they seem to have entirely taken over the centre-left position on our political spectrum from sdp ( traditional social democrats ) . 
  could be something similar going on in germany . 
  refugees from germany , austria , hungary and poland . 
  also a couple thousand soviet pows . 
  this continued up to 1944 , all the way until finland signed an armistice with the soviet union . 
  yeah , i do n't see many other options for finland in 1940 and 1941 . 
  but an alliance is an alliance . 
  countries can be allied without agreeing ideologically ( or even militarily ) 100 % on everything . 
  saying that finland was co-belligerent , not allied with germany has its roots in the cold war . 
  during the cold war , a good relationship with primarily the soviet union but also the west was extremely important . 
  taking that in mind , downplaying the relationship between germany and finland during wwii makes sense . 
  but the reality is that it was an alliance . 
  an alliance of necessity is still an alliance . 
  though the fact that finland handed over a couple thousand soviet pows to germany is something that it is easy to judge finland for . 
   while at the beginning of their relationship , finland handed over jews , who unfortunately were promptly murder , the finnish government later refused subsequent requests . 
  this is n't entirely correct . 
  there was the case of finland handing over 8 jewish refugees in 1942 . 
  in the case of soviet prisoners of war , it continued up to 1944 . 
  according to a recent doctor 's thesis ( suolahti 2015 : yhteinen vihollinen , yhteinen etu ) finland handed a total of approximately 2900 of these pows to germany .
