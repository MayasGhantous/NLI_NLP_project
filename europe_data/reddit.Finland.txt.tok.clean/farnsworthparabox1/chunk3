  the uk are one to talk if we are bringing up historical land grab attempts, 
  fair enough - i 'm hardly a regular there but used to visit occasional for my own amusement and back then it was very pro-brexit but perhaps not anymore now that reality has sunk in, 
  telling them to chill out is pretty far from panicking . 
  yea r/unitedkingdom is the remainers , r/ukpolitics is the brexiteers . 
  they dont - if you read the papers today , all spain said was `` chill out , buddy '', 
  but the uk government has n't commented , condemned or refuted such comments - almost as good as saying they agree fully . 
  no , it would only be hugely unfair to prior eu members trying to come back in and didnt get a fast track . 
  they dont exist . 
  also trident is calculated fully in scotlands budget , ironically . 
  a finnish candy for anyone who doesnt know it , despite the name suggesting otherwise . 
   there was a similar message from uk foreign secretary boris johnson as he arrived at eu foreign ministers ' meeting in luxembourg . 
   mr johnson said : `` the sovereignty of gibraltar is unchanged and is not going to change , and can not conceivably change without the express support and consent of the people of gibraltar and the united kingdom , and that is not going to change . '', 
   theresa may has said the uk is `` committed '' to the territory and its sovereignty is not on the table during brexit talks . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39475127 there you go - government ( including may ) talking about sovereignty of gibraltar , with nothing from spain to provoke such commentary or question about sovereignty your analogy to finland is wrong - the correct analogy would be that finland decided , through no provocation from the russians and no evidence to suggest it , that russia was imminently attacking and then finland started making aggressive comments in the press about invading russia on that basis . 
  that would ** never ** happen, 
  there was a hypothetical question and a hypothetical answer . 
  you are suggesting the question ( and therefore answer ) is actually real by suggesting that spain does in fact want to take over gibraltar . 
  its insulting because they 've never said they would, 
   joint sovereignty which the spaniards will push for  it 's being their implicit policy for awhile  but if they still wanted it , which they would , brexit presents the ideal diplomatic scenario, 
  the interview was hypothetical , you are trying to make it real - read your first comments . 
  if i 've blown this out of proportion , then so has pretty much every newspaper in the uk cos everyone is talking about it . 
  the question was hypothetical , so was the answer . 
  but now people like you ( and probably 95 % of comment section on daily mail ) are trying to make it real , since you are saying the spanish will actually push for sovereignty even if the answer was hypothetical , the guy was wrong to give such a provocative answer . 
  he should 've said `` you are crazy , spain would never do that ! '', 
  instead he said what he said , and including a bizarre analogy to falklands , as though spanish-speaking people are somehow the problem . 
  this is a ridiculous conversation . 
  i 'm done . 
  even if it was made by a former politician / former head of the tory party , nobody i the current government has been willing to condemn or even refute his comments . 
  former head of conservative party . 
  also , not 1 person in the current government has been willing to make a statement on the comments though they 've been asked . 
  they 've made the active decision not to refute or condemn his comments . 
  so the uk are now threatening war over a hypothetical scenario ? 
  it has not been put into question at all . 
  read the article, 
  no it has n't . 
  since the referendum in 2002 , they have totally backed off . 
  read the article !, 
   joint sovereignty which the spaniards will push for . 
  has spain actually ever suggested joint sovereignty with regard to brexit talks ?!, 
  i dont think they have . 
  the only thing the eu has suggested is spain has a say in the relationship the eu has with gibraltar , which has no implication on sovereignty . 
  thats why this chat about war by the tories is even more annoying , they ( and now you it seems ) are accusing spain of something they havent done, 
  the fact that the uk is feeling the need to publicly announce that they will defend the sovereignty ( when its not been put into question ) and saying they will go to war with spain if needed ( when spain has never suggested invading ) does warrant a response . 
  its insulting to spain that this is being suggested about them, 
  i 'm glad the response from spain was just `` chill '' :d, 
  why ? 
  stroopwafel from netherlands . 
  is any of this being reported in any european media ? 
  not a word of it in the finnish press . 
  i think this potential war only exists in the minds of the uk politicians and press . 
  yes but thats what * may * has said , not spain . 
  is she pre-emptively accusing spain of something , or has spain actually said or done anything to suggest they would do anything to damage sovereignty ? 
  wtf - when has spain ever suggested or even hinted at invading gibraltar ?!?!, 
  they havent !, 
  thats whats so offensive about this whole thing . 
  the uk has started talking about a war while spain has never said anything to provoke such commentary - yet you claim that the * uk * are the ones to restore peace when they are actually the * only * ones actually talking about starting a war in the first place . 
  agree - spain has not suggested or threatened any sort of land grab anyway , nor would they do it . 
  all of it has been made up by uk politicians . 
  it 's also super offensive to spain that the uk is making any such claims, 
  what actions of spain on gibraltar ?!, 
  they havent done anything !, 
  i know she didnt say it . 
  but either he said it on her behalf or about her , or then he 's just making shit up . 
  i think the former is more likely to be true . 
  the question may have been a problem , but the response he chose to give made the answer a problem as well . 
  if the uk govt were against a war , he would 've said that spain has never threatened the uk !, 
  and they havent . 
  him going all aggro saying they will start a war with spain is a pretty problematic answer . 
  yea i thought it was a peculiar and dumb choice of words - seems like he 's specifically implying something about spanish-speaking countries . 
  source ? 
  true , but we havent heard such provocative comments over specifically going to war with x country over y issue from the uk government ( or others ) until now , though of course its a given that any country would defend their territories . 
  the eu has done nothing to provoke such commentary, 
  yea its so unnecessary too - nobody has threatened to take over gibraltar so her provocative comments are in response to basically nothing . 
  its so insecure to start threatening security , its like she already is resigned to getting a really shitty deal , without realising that hostile comments certainly wont help her case . 
  i thought tusk handled it really well and diplomatically , basically refused to stoop to her level and just said that `` threat '' in the article 50 letter ( which i personally do think sounded like a threat ) must be misunderstanding cos he knows she wouldnt threaten security of europe, 
  agree totally . 
  any brexiteer claiming the eu was not the reason for peace and prosperity on our continent was always wrong but now has proven to be since she 's discussing war the same week of triggering article 50, 
  i did read the article , not that its really worth doing so since its the telegraph after all . 
  i 'm aware that it said michael howard instead of theresa may but he 's hardly gon na be talking out of his ass , he would only say what he knows is true regarding theresa may . 
  jokes on them . 
  blue passports are not particular to the uk at all, 
  well , that escalated quickly . 
  she went from saying she wants to be good friends and neighbours to wanting war . 
  yes . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it was an autonomous region ( with own money , legislation , citizenship ) called the grand duchy of finland and had their own parliamentary election in 1907 ( the year this picture refers to ) . 
  pretty much the only bit finland wasnt autonomous over was foreign affairs . 
  this question has been asked a lot on this thread so if you look you 'll find even more detailed explanations, 
  i dont see many modern day female politicians ( or male , for that matter ) winning any beauty contests . 
  i guess the closest i can think of who could win is justin trudeau . 
  it does not imply that its two separate events ( as i previously explained ) and i dont feel like going in circles with this argument just because you need to vent for some reason . 
  then your original post where you said my title is misleading is moot, 
  no , you wo n't be able to convince me that because i 'm finnish , my english is automatically poor and i lose the argument . 
  it is n't . 
  i was responding to you - you are saying my title is wrong or misleading because nz is the winner instead of finland and i am telling you that because my title includes both right to vote and right to run for office , i am right . 
  you 're irritating me anyway because this topic has been covered 2-3 times on this thread already . 
  it was still a country though , even if part of russian empire . 
  one duchy still exist in europe today ( luxembourg ) that is a country is it not ? 
  no you are n't - my title says finland is the first country to let women ** both ** vote and run for office ( and does not imply anything other than exactly what it says ) , so you claiming that nz is instead just is n't true . 
  also saying `` one year later . . '' makes it even more obvious its one event ( not that it needed clarifying ),
