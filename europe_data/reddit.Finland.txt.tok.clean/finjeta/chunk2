   stalin did n't understand that a german invasion of the su was coming , and soon , and was utterly surprised when it did occur . 
  this is only partly true . 
  stalin knew hitler was going to backstab him and tried to prepare but did n't think germany would be ready to attack as soon as he did . 
  stalin thought he had another year before war would start and could n't believe germany had gotten ready so quickly . 
  yes , if you read the article youd know it 's about the confession few days ago by rebel commander about killing prisoners of war and some older videos and pictures from donetsk airport .

  according to google translate this article talks about start of euromaiden and i dont see what i should be telling to the ukrainians since it was russia that forced yanukovich not to sign the treaty . 
  ukraine was n't to be allowed to join eu , it was trying to get free trade agreement with them andit did n't say anything about russia ad definetily nothing about russian naval base in crimea . 
  or why has n't belarus been forced to close russian bases in their territory . 
  there was [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2yuowh/probably_nothing_but_reports_of_military/ ) in / r/russia that shows military helicopters landing near kremlin and reports of similiar activity near fsb .

  or maybe they shot it down because they had warned russian not to fly in their airspace for months and just said `` fuck it '' . 
  shooting one fighter down wont make a difference fro the jihadist groups but stops russia from flying in turkish airspace . 
   ... some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell .

  no , something much worse . 
  life in sweden . 
  kinda , i mean even you have only 400 artillery more than us and we have less people than new york . 
  [ 16th in the world ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/armor-towed-artillery-total.asp ) , only russia and ukraine have more artillery in europe than us . 
  im honestly suprised that no one is trying to revive lotta sv\u00e4rd type group as an option for female conscription .

   russia denies annexing crimea russia denies invading poland in 1939 russia denies doping at sochi olympics i love this sub . 
  i refuse to believe that poland would have had worse army than finland at the time . 
  we had hundred fighters from 1920 that flew half the speed soviet ones did . 
  we had 30 `` tanks '' half of which broke down before making to the frontlines , the rest never fired at enemy . 
  we did n't have enough uniforms or ammo for our soldiers or our artillery . 
  by february finland had used most of its pre war ammo and our soldiers were using swedish or russian bullets . 
  the only saving graze finland had was our defensive lines had been recently upgraded and that soviet commanders seemed to be worse at military stradegy than reddits armchair generals . 
  and had their asses kicked few months later by finland . 
  i 'm not saying that poland could have beaten ussr but they did n't exactly have the best military record before 1943 . 
  and this right after russia 's been massing troops at the border . 
  not suspicious timing at all . 
   eastern europe would probably be defeated befor anyone could form a front baltics , maybe . 
  whole eastern europe . 
  you do realise that war isnt just sending bunch of soldiers in one direction untill youve won . 
  you need food , water , ammo , fuel , equipment for your vehicles and much more . 
  launching a suprise attack to entire europe is quite simply impossible not to mention that poland many other eastern europe countries have plans in place for suprise attack to slow them down untill their army is fully mobilized . 
   some sort of hybrid war preparation that knocks out parts of mobile communication , internet/phone , power and water supply could probably be done without a single russian agent/weapon crossing europeans border . 
  so this plan to take out the whole of europes water , power , mobile communication and such would recuire you to strike roughly 80 000 targets in a timeframe of less than a hour . 
  totally realistic . 
  and it would alert the armies who can operate without public infastructure . 
  tldr : no , europe wont fall in a day . 
  because poll asking major companies and financial leaders about their future can not be trusted because a random reddit user knows to let the dust to settle instead of preparing for the fires . 
  there was no distress signal before disapearing from radar but there was one 2 hours after it . 
   just a minor correction , hating gays just makes him an average person not from first world nation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_by_country_or_territory, 
  after reading the whole thing i still have no idea why sweden is ranked so low or why some other countries are falling too since they never mention anything about first world countries having negative growth , quite the opposite in fact . 
  the only thing that i could remotely consider being a reason is refugees ( page 29 ) but even then they specifically mention internal refugee movement , not external . 
  ( sweden is a cohort 4 countries if someone wants to check it ) . 
  i also do n't understand why the hdi in that paper is so different from the real one . 
  according to the paper , norway was meant to have hdi of 0.98 in 2010 but it was actually 0.94 and jumps like that are all over the place . 
  even sweden which according to the paper will have an hdi of 0.941 in 2015 but has 0.907 today . 
  even the said horror of being below libya would leave sweden with hdi of 0.906 , which is still 0.001 bigger than it is today and that 's after apparently losing 0.043 from the 2010 number . 
  tldr : numbers are wrong and the methods not explained . 
  name of the list is `` un projections of very high hdis '' and the bottom pictures and the address shows it came from 4chan . 
  quality source you got there , perhaps do n't trust everything you see online . 
  we make fun of `` people 's current fears '' because it 's more like paranoia where every attacker is labeled as muslim terrorist no matter who they are or what they did . 
  for future reference see this list . 
  if a bomb goes off it 's most likely a muslim , if theres a truck targeting citizen then it 's probably a muslim , if theres a shooting it 's probably not a muslim if theres a random attack with a knife/axe/other then it 's most likely not a muslim .
