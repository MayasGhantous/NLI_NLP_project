  sure it 's awesome to those who travels , but in reality it 's only minority who travels regularly . 
  finns travel more in europe than europeans travel here -  finnish operators have to pay more to foreign operators than foreign operators pay to finnish ones . 
  the increased fee what we will have in future is paid by all , including those who do not travel at all . 
  what happened ? 
  we finns lost nokia and our paper industry ( and russian trade ) . 
  why you are that stagnated ? 
  what happened ? 
  half of your pigs died to plague in multiple years ? 
  do n't be worry because swedes . 
  or actually you should be worried because of swedes . 
  they do n't have to pay housing depts back at all , they just pay interests . 
  there will be economic bubble in sweden and in some day it will burst . 
  when they pay only interest , people have more money to spend for consumption which helps to grow their economy . 
  lets discuss about the price and you can have all the snow we have !, 
  does it drop below that at the nights ? 
  like we do n't have ? 
   tammikuu literally translated as `` oak month '' i do n't have any clue where tammi/oak part comes . 
  oaks does n't even grow in finland naturally , except in southern coastal areas . 
  finnish lands karasjoki and kautokeino :( norwegians could give finmark to us for our 100th independent year . 
  for the people who did n't recognize the name mentioned above .

  it was yle then . 
  why you / u/tommih changed the tittle from attack to killing ? 
  organisaatio did the yle change it ? 
  itse goes now as :  neo-nazi group member gets 2-year prison sentence for helsinki railway station attack, 
  hmm no this is not dehumanizing the victim and justifying the violence . 
  everyone here speak only about the kick . 
  none speaks about how his friend smugled drugs to the hospital for him . 
  he did personal choise to leave the hospital before doctors let him go . 
  he was high in hospital and after he left . 
  but here in / r/europe we talk only about the kick . 
  discussion goes exact same rout as it did in / r/suomi before this was handled in court . 
  before that everyone said drugs did n't matter at all in this case but in court judges though the rupture in his head went worse because of his drug use and early leave from hospital . 
  the kick was n't reason for death . 
  shame on you * because you * tell only half of story . 
  the half what gives most sympathy points . 
  * those who just blame the kicker . 
   `` acts of war between the soviet union and finland recommenced on 22 june 1941 , the day germany launched its invasion of the soviet union ''  who would have known that russians didnt like that we let germans use our air bases to bomb them . 
  the planes i assume you mean came from east-prussia , bombed leningrad and after that landed to utti for refueling before flying back to germany . 
  how is that using finnish air bases to bomb them ? 
  time was ~ 0300 22.06.1941 0605 soviet air force attacked against finniah navy 0730 finnish submarines laid mines to estonian ssr waters 24.06.1941 ussr embassy left finland . 
  25.06.1941 soviets launched bombing campaign against finnish cities with 500 bombers . 
  after that prime minister jukka ragnell spoke in radio and told finland is again in state of war . 
  the first steps of continuation war are well documented so i am not sure why we are figthning about this . 
  hitler said that finland is with them against soviet union but as long i know finland was sovereign state insted of puppet goverment . 
  yes . 
  we finns were in revenge mode but what you say is same bullshit since none of us is nostradamus and capable to foretell what would happen . 
  as i said . 
  we finns knew about operation barbarossa and i am sure would have been attacking but a lot later . 
  i believe it would have been situation where nations like brazil and mexico were . 
  join war when enemy 's hemorrage is deadly sort . 
  but summer 1941 ? 
  no i do n't think so . 
  anyway . 
  it still was defensive war for finns . 
  ussr did n't have proper casus belli for continuation war - and we have to remember how winter war was false flag one . 
  what to regret when it was ussr who attacked first ? 
  after 3 days of ussr bombing on finnish cities and military targets pm of finland declared in radio finland is again in state of war . 
  was finland prepared ? 
  yes . 
  did finland know about the german plans ? 
  yes . 
  are those information relevant ? 
  no , since it was soviets again who were agressor against finland there . 
  you southerners . 
  there are a lot more snow in the ground . 
  the president sauli niinist\u00f6 is 68 years old and his wife jenni haukio is 39 years old . 
  are you out of the loop ? 
  cruises are going to / r/latvia in future . 
  / r/eesti is too expensive after their next tax raise . 
  ketchup is not only thing what pasta needs . 
  salt and ketchup and it , s good . 
  finland have a swedish speaking [ minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish-speaking_population_of_finland#/media/file:svenskfinland_municipalities_2008.png ) . 
  hufvudstadsbladet is one of their major newspaper . 
   but its true . 
  proof it then . 
  you did n't tell them when you head back to home sun is already below the horizon . 
  fun times . 
  maybe he meant really clear night sky . 
  there are couple of brighter objects on sky like north star , sirius , canopus etc with jupiter and other satellites what could be visible . 
  i have not ever lived city sized as coepenhagen so i am not sure . 
  once some redditor from netherlands said that he have n't ever seen a stars on sky . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=4&amp;lat=7902543&amp;lon=2441215&amp;layers=b0tffff ) is the reason why not . 
  when i was a kid i used to lie on my back in snow during winters with my cousin . 
  we were looking a stars and we also wondered what is out there . 
  aliens ? 
  it was clear sky in finnish countryside without any light pollution * . 
  just like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/awb3aox_h4y ) ? 
  from data : the netherlands lose ** again ** . 
  uk north ? 
  you [ southrons ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/southron ) . 
  some of friends of my go to haaparanta to buy some snus so i ask them to bring me raml\u00f6sa . 
  heresy . 
  -15 to -20 \u00bac is totally okay . 
  i 'd like to be in spain now !, 
  winter war was ended way before battle of norway . 
   biggest evil europe has ever seen . 
  and you mean soviets right ? 
   finlandization it does n't mean what you meant . 
  finland had bilateral trade agreements with soviet union but finlandiztion means that politicians/press form their policy/actions to not agitate soviets and to act as resigned in front of soviet union .
