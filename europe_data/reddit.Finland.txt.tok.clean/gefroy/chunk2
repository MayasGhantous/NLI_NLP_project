   none of them wanted to request asylum in belgium , so they have been ordered `` to leave the territory '' . 
  i am thinking what would happen to the random man without a proper documents and without registration to shengen area if he would be from africa/middle-east . 
  if he would n't ask asylum should n't he be arrested for the illegal entry to country ? 
  would the police say `` leave the territory '' to the man who would be from a ) canada , b ) panama , c ) kosovo or d ) thailand or would police arrest them if he would n't ask asylum ? 
  it was sub-zero here in kainuu on last night .

  there is really a problem with patent and copyright things in seed market . 
  there is [ colombian document called 9.70 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkq8u2khabi ) what tells :  9.70 documentary '' tells the story of a group of farmers from which the colombian government seized and destroyed 70 tons of rice . 
   in a very short amount of time , the colombian government approved a series of laws and resolutions in order to sign a free trade agreement ( fta ) with the united states as quickly as possible . 
  one of the conditions set by the us was to create a legislation for the ` privatization ' of seeds . 
   the documentary examines the impact caused by these decisions , exemplifying them by using the case of campoalegre , a southern colombian town where the resolution was set in motion . 
  in 2011 , the agency responsible for monitoring agricultural activities in colombia ( ica ) came to the town and seized 70 tons of rice , then returned with the police , and finally destroyed the seeds by burying them in a landfill for considering them illegal .

  i am from countryside and my uncle ran our family farm after my grandpa . 
  i were living in next house 300 meter far away . 
  i am not saying that i am farmer but are you ? 
  i doubt that . 
  anyway . 
  for example if my uncle bought 2 tons of seeds and if he only used 1900kg for his fields - he would have to destroy the last 100kg . 
  where is common sense on that scenario ? 
  there is none . 
  as an european i am okay with gmo if it does n't have patents . 
  a while ago there were a news article in ~ ~ helsingin sanomat ~ ~ [ yle ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/kuka_omistaa_siemenet__suurteollisuus_vai_ihmiskunta/8008546 ) that there are problems with gmo seeds in usa - farmers have to buy gmo-seeds every year from same provider and farmers are not allowed to store the seeds for the next year . 
  if they do so gmo-provider can sue the farmer . 
  i do n't like such development in our society .

  musti is retired now after 50 years . 
  in the map there is a finnish city vaasa is where i used to live a year back . 
  there used to be older harbour in vaasa but because of post-glacial uplift they had to move it to better location . 
  i have also heard something about even older harbour before those two but i am not sure about it . 
  a bit of inland there is also a `` vanha/old vaasa - gamla vasa what used to be coastal city but is no more . 
  post-glacial uplift is truly real deal there . 
  you norwegians are lucky again . 
  we finns can only protect from savage swedes if we flee to lakes and forests - unfortunately swedes have a little practice of both already . 
  are you saying that was not scene from history document ? 
  the report i linked have eurostat as a source . 
  research have been published in 2013 and uses 183 billion as estimate of full year so it varies a bit from exact value . 
  `` eurostat is a directorate-general of the european commission located in luxembourg . 
  its main responsibilities are to provide statistical information to the institutions of the european union ( eu ) '' - wikipedia . 
  [ direct link to eurostat source of gdb in europe 2003-2004 , 2012-2014 also with ppp and percentage differences and exact euro value ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/2d/gdp_at_current_market_prices%2c_2003%e2%80%9304_and_2012%e2%80%9314_yb15.png ) . 
  your link does n't lead to anything but google . 
  i assume you meant first link what shows greek gdp as value 250 billion . 
  first link uses as source a world bank what is organization with hq in washington dc so this graph shows gpd as usd . 
  2013 exchance rate of usd to euro was [ ~ 0.75 according to x-rates . com ] ( http://www.x-rates.com/average/?from=usd&amp;to=eur&amp;amount=1&amp;year=2013 ) . 
  250 billion 2013 usd to 2013 euros is 187.5 billion euros . 
  what is same what eurostat gives . 
   check your facts that you follow . 
  is there some other facts i need to check ? 
  i do n't believe - i follow facts . 
  shadow economy is huge thing in southern europe and fixing it we would n't have crisis like this . 
  at the year of 2013 greek gdp was 183 billion euros and the size of shadow economy was extra 24 % - 43 billion euros . 
  if they could decrease that to half it would be 21 1/2 billion euros more taxable money - think if they would have such moneys as taxable every year past 20 years . 
  every euro in shadow economy is problem and i am not saying it 's not a problem here in north but if country like greece have one fifth of gdp in shadow economy , i think it is justified to say greeks do not follow rules . 
  people in greece have to change their mind about the idea of paying taxes . 
  if greece would have been more effective taxing system would we have crisis like this with this size ?

  it is strength to follow eu rules and forbid greece aid . 
  it is embarrassing to give money to greece because it is literally against eu rules . 
  especially against the [ article 123 ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-viii-economic-and-monetary-policy/chapter-1-economic-policy/391-article-123.html ) and [ article 125 ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-viii-economic-and-monetary-policy/chapter-1-economic-policy/393-article-125.html ) . 
  rules are here for reason and [ greece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece ) / south europe could have to follow rules and pay taxes instead of dodging taxes and milking subsidies ( [ island of blind for example ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/04/03/wsj-island-of-the-blind-riles-greek-public/ ) ) . 
  oh , though you meant the writing there . 
  i have seen some stereotype maps about the europe from american perspective with finland as blank spot because none know we really exists . 
  step by step into the nordics . 
  personally it would be okay for me to give you right to vote in nordic council . 
   finland actually finland does . 
  unfortunately we have 2 official languages and finland is republiken finland , finland on that minority language . 
   finland is not part of scandinavia in any way . 
  northern finland is part of scandinavian peninsula . 
  denmark is not part of scandinavian peninsula . 
  denmark is part of cultural scandinavia when we finns have only ties to it trough the swedish rule - lot of similarities but still different .

  you are correct on that but true finns used to be the name so it 's accepted still on these days .

  i have been never met a swedish speaker in finland who identifies him/herself to swede instead of finnoswede . 
  some of them identify themselves to pure finns . 
  my experience with swedish speaking minority is that i got small branch of my family ( mother 's side ) who speak swedish as first language ( i am even a godparent to one swedish speaking girl ) and i have some friends who speak swedish as first language , but they also speak finnish language . 
  i have also lot of family ( father 's side ) who live in sweden but they are pure finns - naturally they speak swedish now after 40 years . 
  some of their children have been born there and i am not really sure how do they identify themselves .
