  [ two swedes have been arrested by norwegian police for smuggling more than 250kg of butter into the country ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/8965649/swedes-arrested-for-butter-smuggling.html )  the arrests follow the seizure earlier this month of a 90kg consignment found stashed in the car of a russian man at the norwegian-swedish border the norwegian police plan to destroy the confiscated butter . 
  and the food crisis was that bad in norway that you smuggled sm\u00f6r from the sweden , finland and denmark ...  a norwegian newspaper sought to attract new subscribers by offering them a half kilo of butter , while students auctioned butter on the internet in a bid to raise funds for graduation parties .

  as a publically identified as a greek i choose you to be target on my question : how is the living on the basic greek , who have a job and gains somewhat medicore ( or just a bit lower ) payment for it . 
  life is still totally okay on them , right ? 
  73 years , 11 months and 8 days ago , 22.6.1941 at the 6.05 without declaration of war soviet airplanes bombed armoured ships at the waters of finnish \u00c5lands . 
  at the 7.55 soviet artillery began to shoot finnish areas from the hanko peninsula what was rented to soviet union after winter war . 
  on same day the minister of foreign affairs of finland required a declaration from soviet ambassador in finland . 
  finland did n't return to the artillery fire 24.6 finland let soviet union to evacuate the embassy in helsinki . 
  25.6 soviet air forces bombed helsinki with dozen other cities with ~ 500 planes and air defences shot down 27 planes . 
  on same day prime minister ragnell stated in radio that we are again in war against soviet union . 
  finnish army began to march and 10.7.1941 army started an offensive and first units reached the laatokka ( biggest lake in europe and half of it used to be part of finland before the winter war ) . 
  end of the august finnish army reached old borders in karelia . 
  hell yes finnish people were eager to take lost lands back . 
   how would such a war end ? 
  both world wars were fought until one side was utterly defeated . 
  unconditional surrender was the only outcome . 
  it debends what are the wargoals . 
  not all wars end to unconditional surrender . 
   and what about tactical nukes . 
  say you are russia and you can destroy the american 4th fleet with tactical nukes fired from a sub or aircraft . 
  if you do n't the 4th fleet will get into the black sea . 
  do you launch ? 
  this would be like in chess . 
  would you eat a rook with sacrificing a knight what would be eaten by the bishop . 
  in this scenario the bishop would be eating 2nd pacific fleet what is advancing to sea of japan . 
  i ca n't answer to your question . 
   this is true if you consider everyone to be level-headed and sane . 
  i thought it is / r/europe 's consenus that putin is n't actually sane . 
  well , if we had buddies like hitler and stalin in 1940 's i trust obama and putin . 
  some ex putin troll said in western news that putin trolls are not allowed to speak negative things what were caused to russia since the illegal annexation of crimea . 
  would you mind to proof that you are not a paid putin troll with speaking how western sanctions effect to your daily life ? 
  i doubt that . 
  there is no point to use nuclear warheads if retaliation would destruct as much from own areas . 
  would be different if one side would ' t have to be afraid of retaliation but that is not really possible when both sides have hidden nuclear submarines at the coastal areas . 
  kinda same that everyone were scared of gas attacks in ww2 but none used it . 
  why ? 
  the benefits what you gain from first gas attack is lost because enemy will use gas attacks later to you . 
   finland owes alot to germany , they helped us secure our independence in the civil war , they helped us by arming our weak military , training us and helped fight the soviets . 
  if it was n't for the germans we might have not gained our independence nor defended it successfully . 
  we need you badass germany !, 
  well said . 
   what can i say , the party of this person is in the government . 
  i might read you wrong then . 
  seems you meant the party itself instead of the person . 
  have you tested yet [ salmiakki ice cream ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njbbakwoeeq ) ? 
  it 's is tv commercial so finnish part is bit exaggerated . 
  he is member of [ city council of helsinki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_council_of_helsinki ) and presents fifth largest party in city . 
  bit different job than a people do in a parlament . 
  edit : yes yes . 
  downvote the facts . 
  goverment \u2260 city council . 
  actually , it is said that picture is fake . 
  i am not going to argue is it or not but concentration camps were kinda popular in every country , including in americans at the time . 
  bit different than death camps what germany had . 
  edit : [ this new article ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1405061679323 ) says that the finnish troops left the city 27.6 , soviet troops liberated the camp 28.6 and 30.6 photographer galina sanko gathered kids behind the barbed wire and take photo . 
  picture is used a lot in soviet union after the war without a finnish language text and used to tell what `` fasict camps looks like '' . 
  nazi means people who is part of the party . 
  did an average g\u00fcnther who was drafted to arms sign his name to party participant list at same time ? 
  nope . 
  well , to be fair the commanders were killed by their own politruks , just because their unit failed or they retreated . 
  thanks for long posts . 
  i really appreciate it - short 1 sentence answers are really uninteresting because it never answer tho question : `` why this one wrote that , what is the background '' . 
  anyway , there is my answer . 
  ( after the writing , it went a bit longer what i though first ) --  the first is that it 's by no means a given that much of your tax money goes towards the kind of public services you like . 
  most people think of roads , schools , etc. 
  but only about 1.7 % of your taxes goes towards roads and transport , for example , a sum that is vastly overpowered by the phenomenal amounts that go towards bombs and methods of dropping them . 
  you are correct on that what is image of the taxes . 
  roads and schools are top of the mind on everyone . 
  i am on finland so i use my country as example . 
  finland is also pretty small country so budget is calculated easily - 2015 revenues are 51\u00a0938\u00a0438\u00a0231 $ and expenditures are 55\u00a0037\u00a0649\u00a0885 $ so the difference is -3 099\u00a0211\u00a0654 $ . 
  the numbers are from [ this ] ( http://www.valtionbudjetti.fi/ ) site . 
  unfortunately it 's not working with google translate - anyway , i recommend you to explore that website because it gives nice overall view from revenues/expenditures in finland ( example as western welfare state what we both present ) . 
  i am pretty sure there are websites about belgium available in internet . 
  about the budget itself you can see that in finland most money 8 784\u00a0244\u00a0246 $ ( ~ 16 % of total budget ) goes as an aid to the municipalities . 
  municipalities have in finland 535 different mandatory tasks by law and over than thousand obligations how each task have to do ( mostly reporting duties ) [ source ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1371351220725 ) municipalities gives a services to citizens and each service needs workers . 
  because of that 48 % of the budget of the municipality goes as payment to workers . 
  [ there ] ( http://www.virtuaalikunta.net/fi/tietoa/talous/sivut/default.aspx ) is a chart what shows the expenditures in municipalities as in percentages . 
  social and health services 52 % these are healt care , financial aid to the poor people , taking care of elder people , kindergarten etc. 
  education and cultural services 23 % schools , libraries , museums , galleries , youth and free time services , physical education services like swimming halls , jogging paths and playing fields etc other tasks 20 % fire department and rescue , garbage collection , sewers , water supply , energy supply etc. 
  financial and other expenditures 5 % loans etc. 
  because private sector is not enough good in each municipality the budged depends a lot from money what the state gives . 
  [ here is a list from 2011 ] ( http://www.yle.fi/tvuutiset/uutiset/upics/liitetiedostot/kuntien_verorahoitus_2011.htm ) of each municipality what kind of percentage from the incomes comes from the state . 
  small northern municipalities got most money from the state . 
  [ this ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/sipila_leikkaa_miljardeja__kokeile_laskurilla_miten_sina_saastaisit/7988198 ) news site was made just after the elections . 
  finland is living with loan at the moment and we have to decrease our expenditures what means cutting the benefits . 
  with sliders you have to save 4 billion euros and there is slider for everything . 
  numbers are for 2019 when is the time for next parliament elections . 
  unfortunately the sliders does not work with google translate but if you are interested you have to translate it manually . 
  i tried to save money but it was really really hard . 
  government have so many different task what it have to do . 
  not only schools , health care and roads what the image are . 
  --  you also get only a tiny say on the expenditures you think are morally wrong . 
  in belgium , for example , the weapons factories selling guns to gaddafi were national companies , paid for by your taxes whether you like it or not . 
  i used [ this ] ( http://armsglobe.chromeexperiments.com/ ) internet site - it shows global sales of military and civilians arms trade from 1992 to 2010 . 
  gaddafi were overthrown during 2011 arab-spring event . 
  anyway , even if such would happen with any other similar country it is still an investment . 
  you spend money for it - you gain more money from it . 
  moral is double bladed sword - if you have cellphone ( and you have ) and relatively cheap clothes it tells you support [ cheap labour , propably child labour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfans2y_frk ) and you are funding [ wars in kongo ] ( http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/12/07/the-ugly-truth-about-the-materials-in-your-cellphone/ ) . 
  we who live in west , we do n't care about the moral , check the youtube video behind child labour text - 2min video about the 2 $ t-shirt vending machine in middle of berlin .
