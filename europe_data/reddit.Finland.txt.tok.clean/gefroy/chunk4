  t-shirt what i am wearing at the moment is tagged with text : made in bangladesh . 
  where is the shirt you are using manufactured ? 
  maybe this was enough of moral . 
  --  the second counterargument is that the services provided by the state are essentially geographic monopolies , so even the ones you think of as morally commendable ( education , healthcare , etc ) are provided in a very inefficient way ... 
  privatization is good , and it 's bad . 
  difference on it is that private company have to make profit to work . 
  if the winnings margin is not enough for owner it will decrease the investment money to service it products . 
  for example here in finland is quite much of debate about the free meals in school kids . 
  every kid in primary school and in high school gets a free meal each school day in finland . 
  there are many schools in each municipality and each got own kitchen . 
  now after privatization there is only one large kitchen what products all the food and brings the food to schools with cars . 
  it gives a saving to municipality because old way cost 2 000 000 $ and after privatization it only cost 1 900 000 $ but it decreased a quality on it . 
  it fill the requirements of food but is it good when potatoes are `` rubber potatoes '' because the potatoes were boiled without the peel . 
  because this varies in each municipality i do n't bring any source . 
  another example is [ vehicle inspection ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mot_test ) what is mandatory to do in every year here in finland . 
  in finland here used to be government owned company what got largest market share . 
  but at 2003 government sold suomen autokatsastus oy to private sector and what it caused : - pricing increased - small companies have been driven out . 
  positive about that is vehicle inspection stations are open for longer time each day and now they offer coffee for customers - service is better . 
  because of the slow bureaucracy in finland it seems that the status of small companies is not going any easier in future what would decrease the price . 
  i am not saying all privatization is bad . 
  some tasks are totally okay to be done by private sector .

  ** bit old [ data ] ( http://www.trafi.fi/filebank/a/1321969240/cd706fe6ef12f53357dc7dc4298f5717/1298-ake207selvityskatsastustoiminnanhintakehityksesta.pdf ) about the vehicle inspection but page 17 tells in english that 150 % rise in payment from 1994 to 2007 . 
  current ** average ** prices from [ katsastushinnat.fi ] ( http://www.katsastushinnat.fi/ ) website are today : - inspection 44.43 $ - [ obd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/on-board_diagnostics ) 13.62 $ - exhaust gas for petrol engines 18.51 $ ( total 76.56 $ ) or diesel 29.18 $ ( total 87.23 $ ) exhaust gas test can be done in authorized repair station . 
  obd is done for cars manufactured 2001 or later . 
  more taxes are only good because it 's more moneys to public services . 
  i think there is no cap how good such services are . 
  well , all state authorities have to serve with finnish and swedish language in every municipality in finland . 
  it is officials duty to use interpreter if neither citizen or official use another language enough good . 
  actually , they can go to easter finland and demand ~ ~ any ~ ~ state public service with swedish language ... that 's the law . 
  someone once told his skin burned in florida even it was cloudy there, 
  unfortunately only 1 nation from 5 is producing petrol . 
  norwegians does n't need any paradise islands because they can go to their [ bouvet island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) . 
  greece should start a sell their tropical paradise islands - we nordics could buy one or two . 
  once i played as muscovy in ck2 and i declared a holy war against suomenusko tribes . 
  my great army melt away because of huge attrition . 
  the areas could supply only ~ 800 guys . 
  well . 
  my branch changed quite to the opposite what i am trained for . 
  wuhwuh . 
   i thought you would say the 6-5 victory against them in the world cup 2003 . . 
  this is something we do not discuss . 
  well , winter war began with soviet attack to finland 30.11.1939 and ended to peace 13.3.1940 . 
  great britain and france decided to send troops to finland ( other side of coin is that they wished to block the ore transports to germany from swedish [ kiruna mine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiruna_mine ) . 
  28.3.1940 allied forces planned to mine norwegian waters so german vessels have to stay in open waters - they did n't mine any waters before german attack to denmark and norway 9.4.1940 . 
  allied forces did a their own landing to norway 16-17 .4.1940 . 
  last allied forces were withdrawn from norway 7.6.1940 and king of norway ordered the surrender 9.6.1940 . 
  tl ; dr : war over norway was n't even started when winter war ended . 
  there is town called [ lestij\u00e4rvi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lestij%c3%a4rvi ) what gives 1000e per year for 10 years if you get baby .

  well , we `` rurals '' do not ask highways , hospitals and universities to each county . 
  what we ask is maintaining roads , schools for children and health centers for each county .

  edit . 
  oh , it was [ linked ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35c4my/happy_europe_day_reurope/cr31upj ) earlier to this thread . 
  does your railroad company ( s ) say same excuses than in your eastern neighbor that there is snow on the rails at winter and it 's raining at summer ? 
  that ca n't be correct . 
  finnish valtionrautatiet ca n't be that good . 
  vr is kinda hated in public here . 
  where you were ? 
  you can continue to spread your pirate/lefty butthurtism but you have to remember - the representative you mock is part of party in opposition . 
  in opposition you can only speak , sign the iniatives and question the coalition members . 
  [ there ] ( http://kansanmuisti.fi/member/hakkarainen-teuvo/?as.type.st=1&amp;as.type.si=1&amp;as.type.in=1&amp;as.type.wq=1 ) is a nice website in finnish language you can follow what each represantive have and have not done . 
  with your logic the future prime minister is in same boat - he also were in outside of coalition . 
  do you mock him for doing nothing ? 
  to work , study or follow your love - sure , no problem . 
   people vote wrong sometimes exept people ca n't vote `` wrong '' . 
  you can disagree with that x percent of people but that x percent is direct share of population on area . 
  he probably meant word : coalition . 
  yeh , there is [ 2011 version ] ( http://www2.hs.fi/extrat/kotimaa/puoluekentta/ ) for comparison . 
  pretty conservative there . 
  national coalition party is liberal , not conservative . 
  the finns party is conservative . 
  - centre - kesk - national coalition party - kok - the finns - ps - social democrats - sdp - greens - vihr - leftist - vas - swedish people 's party - rkp - christian democrats - kd and - vasemmisto - left wing - oikeisto - right wing - liberaali - liberal - konservatiivi - conservative, 
  kesk wont allow vas to join the cabinet because it would turn the scale too left . 
  rkp could be an option if ps promises not to touch swedish language teaching in schools for next 4 years - it 's a big thing for ps but the minister audi is more important . 
  green party is not okay for kesk for ideological reasons and kd is so signfiant it wont help at all but could do harm in future . 
  this is pretty good text about how nokia died . 
  the original [ in finnish ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/a1380853015869 ) and same [ on english ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/a1381288411564 ) . 
  pretty scary reading . 
  you forget ps what makes things a bit easier when future prime minister can pick two big parties with them to cabinet . 
  for example the iltalehti ( not a best source for this i know ) predicted [ that ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/vaaligraf7mp_eb.jpg ) kind of result . 
  the elections will be close to that according the polls we have and if unless there is nothing surpricing . 
  keskusta wishes to get in cabinet with sdp to form old `` puna-multa - red-soil ? '', 
  because so called `` porvari-burgher '' cabinet did n't go so good in the past . 
  also ps wishes to join the cabinet for first time ever . 
  quite common in europe . 
  abbreviation may vary a bit . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_european_socialists#member_parties lithuania , germany , sweden , switzerland etc. 
  the public sector is really massive so it requires a lot of tax incomes from private sector . 
  finland have been doing something we call cheese slicer policy - cut a bit from everything . 
  basically we need two massive reforms to get balance on economy . 
  - [ municipal mergers in regions ] ( http://vm.fi/en/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/expansion-of-government-powers-with-regard-to-municipal-mergers-will-not-proceed?_101_instance_chtsflfececq_redirect=%2fen%2fsearch%2f-%2fq%2fmunicipalities ) - [ social welfare and health care reform ] ( http://www.stm.fi/en/ministry/strategies/service_structures ) we really need those 2 to get passed asap and our economy to grow because we will have big expenses in the future because our future army reforms . 
  we need new ships for our navy and new fighters for our air force from 2025 onwards . 
  both need a separate funding - but it seems we ca n't have all what we were planned to have . 
  it 's unfortunately because there always will be an army in finland - our own or foreign , not both . 
  it 's amazing how people used to vote same parties in every elections . 
  i have to admit that things went good prior 2007 financial crisis so i do n't understand the result of elections of 2011 . 
  also it makes things go hard if every prime minister after lipponen 2 leaves the office before the elections .
