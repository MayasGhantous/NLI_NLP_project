  lasts of them could do hard the choices but they did n't do and now they ask vote them again . 
  personally i have lost my trust for the old major parties so i will vote the fourth option in next elections . 
  i would like to see how [ the finns party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns_party ) will act in cabinet . 
  it ca n't go any worse than the current one . 
  kesk and sdp took a lot of loan 2003-2007 before the crisis when everything went fine in finland . 
  during vanhanen 2 the shit hit the fan , hard , and this last katainen + stubb coalition have been a joke because 6 of 8 parties were in cabinet . 
  it have been like stagnation and ministers have been talking same liibadaaba since the last elections how to fix the economy but still we are waiting for the next cabinet to do the hard decisions to fix the economy . 
  i really hope next cabinet have 's only 3 parties without any small parties . 
  3 large parties can take 120 + from total 200 seats and it 's more than enough . 
  in the finnish army the nco 's teach that gayism is brotherhood . 
  well , looks like they are drinking on some summer cottage ( at winter ) so probably they came from/are going to sauna . 
  atleast it look like our cottage drinking trips . 
  then it 's better to sell naquadria to arabs . 
  i just came back home from p4x-351 and i found a good stash . 
  after couple of these trips alfred nobel seems like poor guy next to me with his tnt . 
  [ mutual defence clause ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/treaties/lisbon_treaty/ai0026_en.htm ) the treaty of lisbon introduces for the first time a mutual defence clause , specifically binding eu member states . 
  if a member state is the victim of an armed attack on its territory , it can rely on the aid and assistance of the other member states , which are obliged to help . 
  two restrictions moderate this clause : - the mutual defence clause does not affect the security and defence policy of certain member states , specifically those which are traditionally neutral ; - the mutual defence clause does not affect the commitments made under the framework of the north atlantic treaty organization - nato . 
  neutral countries like finland , sweden , austria and ireland reserved right to stay out of that part of lissabon treaty .

  have to say those are impressive aurora borealis to be photoed in that south . 
  i visited in prague couple of years ago and at late night after the bars i went to local fast food restaurant what was not a franchise place . 
  most surprising thing there was that they did n't use cash register . 
  they literally had a small metal box where they kept the change and they calculated the price with pocket calculator . 
  here in finland every shop/market/barber / restaurant , no matter what kind of shop you have , you need to have a cash register what automatically writes double receipt - one for a customer and one for shopkeeper and there are no exceptions with that rule . 
  that made me wonder what kind of rules they have for cash registers in greece ? 
  if there is no same kind of rule - they better make that . 
  anyway . 
  best way to collect taxes would be to forbid the cash money and use only debid/credit cards nationwide . 
  silence , your \u00f6stsverige might be smaller in size but have bigger military and we still have grudge over the p\u00e4iv\u00e4rinta incidence in 1975 . 
  these warmongers on both sides of us . 
  at least we still have peaceful norway as our neighbor . 
  usually dreams do not exist . 
  finland : - still dreaming about greater finland, 
  oh conjugations mentioned . 
  we are able to conjugate noun ` kauppa/shop ' with [ 2253 different ways ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) . 
  this kind of comments makes me think that what kind of education is in countries where they come from . 
  germans did n't refuse to leave . 
  in peace terms with finland and su were a note that finland have to seise all german proverty and expel the germans . 
  finland told that to germans and they began to leave . 
  after a while su noticed that it was not agressive at all - su forced finland to take arms against the old brother in arms . 
  finland had to attack or it would be a violating the peace treaty agreements with the su - there were danger that su attacks finland then . 
  tl ; dr : germans was moving out from country - but not enough for the soviets .

  i suggest you to read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/4eg2mb/oc_laine_vs_puljuj\u00e4rvi_an_in_depth_breakdown ) . 
  it is well written even it is oc . 
  you have to remember that s/he lives in england . 
  [ there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uopgpr6mom ) are some cultural differences . 
  please say you are not from edmonton ? 
  graveyard of talent , like what philadelphia used to be for goalies years ago . 
  anyway , laine is better - his shot is impressive for his age . 
   any cool prison break stories ? 
  as my knowledge says that ~ ~ breaking out is not illegal here and does not grant more jail time ~ ~ . 
  i remember i read that from some news but i could be wrong tough . 
  edit : it is crime to flee - but if you are on holiday but do n't return back to prison - it is not a crime . 
  will do . 
  drinking average 1 liter per day . 
  i just checked the days from the carton and it was packed 5.3 and last day to use is 14.3 . 
  just the basic milk what is pasteurised , homogenisated and with added vitamin-d . 
  alcohol seems to be cheap in south . 
  once i heard that if you are going to visit someones home in france and you give a bottle of wine as a souvenir - it would be same than bringing a milk carton in finland . 
  not really sure is there a truth behind this . 
  just bought 3 liters with 0.87 $ per liter . 
  i think there are even cheaper in lidl with 0.75 $ . 
  just bought 3 liters with 0.87 $ . 
  couple of years ago it was 1.10 $ per litre . 
  i do n't get it why greek police does n't arrest those for crimes like illegal border crossing ? 
  crimes ca n't be acceptable even if there would be a lot of criminals doing same things . 
  last time i checked illegal border crossing were a crime . 
  hey , atleast it 's + + + . 
  well , inflation eats all of it anyway so it 's \u00b1 0 . 
  partition of sweden , all of us have been waiting this exact moment for centuries . 
  someone linked [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d9micit.jpg ) to finnish subreddit / r/suomi . 
  text told that this is from finnish peacekeepers base but now the base is controlled by the french forces . 
  this thread gave me great joy but the basic depression is lurking behind of me now . 
  i am sad ... 
  there are 3 places where finnish man can be do close to another man when it would be a problem in `` normal '' situation . 
  - sauna , everyone is equal there . 
  - any place where we are drunk . 
  foreigners could call us social on that special moment . 
  - army , `` gayism '' is `` brotherhood '' during conscription year . 
  mix two of those and it 's even better . 
  99 % of time it 's drunk in sauna with friends . 
   i 'm a military police by training , maybe i should start to expect a letter from the army !, 
   yep . 
  same here . 
  i am trained for reconnaisance nco but i am stationed to mp squad leader in sa-int . 
  i myself consider myself patriotic . 
  finnish culture is deep in with me and i think i do n't have anything common with people who live outside of nordic countries . 
  every rule have exception , here it is estonians . 
  i hope that the nordic council would turn eu-like organization but i understand the economic advantages of eu but i do n't really support it as structure what writes regulations , directives and other acts . 
  some of directives does n't work here in north . 
  best example of that was phase out incandescent light bulbs what created heat . 
   the nordic council is the official inter-parliamentary body in the nordic region . 
  the nordic council was formed in 1952 . 
  the council has 87 elected members from denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as from the faroe islands , greenland and \u00c5land . 
  written for example [ here ] ( http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/new_zealand/press_corner/all_news/news/2015/20october_eu_army_en.htm )  the treaty of lisbon introduces for the first time a mutual defence clause , specifically binding eu member states .
