   two restrictions moderate this clause :  - the mutual defence clause does not affect the security and defence policy of certain member states , specifically those which are traditionally neutral ;  - the mutual defence clause does not affect the commitments made under the framework of the north atlantic treaty organization - nato . 
  there is no military alliance in eu . 
  there is a mutual defence clause but neutral countries are opted out which means we finns , swedes , irishmans , austrians and people of cyprus . 
  interesting thing was after terrorist attack in paris . 
  french asked help , we finns participated giving ~ 100h of our flight hours on common transportation planes . 
  since when we lost northern finland ? 
  even wikipedia writes : '' ... is a peninsula in northern europe , which today covers norway , sweden and most of northern finland . '', 
  if that is wrong , would you mind to make it correct please . 
  [ odoacer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odoacer ) superceded last west roman emperor [ romulus augustulus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romulus_augustulus ) and odoacer formed kingdom of italy and returned the imperial insignia to constantinople . 
  thus this east roman empire is real roman empire . 
  is there a list of nations what are already reserved ? 
  personally i have been thinking that i should uninstall paradox games from my computer . 
  time to time i tend to play euiv/ckii/hoi3 / vic2 too much so it effects negatively my slept - i do n't sleep enough and i see game dreams . 
  maybe sounds fun but i did n't write this as a joke .

  btw . 
  why there is norwegian nobel commitee at all ? 
  sweden and norway were in union during the time of alfred nobel but alfred were swede . 
  stupid question . 
  no he does n't . 
  first pill is your personal choice . 
  it does n't force you to take it but how about the second ? 
  your discretion is altered . 
  had to pick sweden . 
  it feels most like home even it would n't be home . 
  would be disaster to my mind forget the sauna . 
  it is most unfonately people here are downvoting honest answer . 
  but that logic ... a gun is only a tool . 
  banning a guns is like banning a cars . 
  the pencil is miss spelling words etc. 
  drugs are killing people and i do n't believe it would n't stop in future no matter what happens . 
  one drug is already killing more people than anything , alcohol , and it is legal already . 
   [ assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths worldwide in 2013 , up from 128,000 deaths worldwide in 1990 . 
  [ 2 ] there were 47,000 unintentional firearm deaths worldwide in 2013 . 
  [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_violence )  [ dangerous alcohol consumption was responsible for 3.3 million deaths worldwide in 2012 , according to a new world health organization report monday . 
  ] ( http://time.com/96082/alcohol-consumption-who/ ) but drugs drugs as the drugs  [ drug abuse kills about 200,000 people worldwide each year , according to a new united nations ( un ) report . 
  ] ( http://www.drugfree.org/join-together/drug-abuse-kills-200000-people-each-year-un-report/ ) why we ca n't compare weapons and drugs is that it is the man who squeeze the trigger - however in case of the drugs it is the drug itself what effects to the judgement skills of the man and thus this the actions of the man . 
  combining these two equals to disaster . 
  if someone is sick by mind and does something horrible wrong - he ca n't keep responsible for the actions , it is the sickness behind it and it have to be treated . 
  in case of drug , when a man takes the pill and do something wrong it is not same - because the man took the pill on purpose and the drug effected his brains and thus this he made actions he would n't do sober . 
  it is another discussion where is the limit on stimulant and drugs . 
  anyway , this conversation is not about the drugs or cars but the weapons . 
  to avoid school shootings and other gun violence we have to make sure there are strict rules who can own the weapons ( these reservists who shoot reservist shootings are generally using weapons they do not own themselves ) and those rules have to be followed . 
  sick people have to be treated and they better not to touch any weapons . 
  are those guns harming you in some way ? 
  is it bad that some people wish to train their skills for the day when shit hits the fan ? 
  i do n't really get the reasoning why such weapons should be banned when there is a real purpose for it - but i am eager to listen . 
  i could be wrong . 
  it was times ago . 
  what are we to judge them ? 
  people ca n't vote wrong . 
  this is the way french people wish to see their nation to go sl let it be that . 
  if i remember correctly they had to take loan from russian banks because none of francais banks gave them any . 
  well , there is an example of noun [ kauppa ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) - 2253 times .

  sounds fair for russian pilot that turkish commander ordered to shoot missile knowing that jet is going back to the syrian air space . 
  -- operator : `` sir . 
  the russian jet entered to our airspace 3 seconds ago . 
  commander : `` pilot , shoot it down '' pilot : `` base . 
  the russian jet is heading back to syrian airspace and will be there in 8 seconds '' commander : `` shoot it down , now '' pilot : `` fox two ! '', 
  operator : `` the russian jet entered to the syrian airspace '' pilot : `` base , returning to the airfield '' operator : `` hit in 10 seconds . 
  9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , we have a kill '' commander : `` well done lads '', 
  laws are different in different countries and self defence rules very a lot - here in finland the judiciary gives judgment for excessive use of force . 
  anyway i would like to you to check [ the map ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/a069/production/_86856014_russian_plane_shot_down_624.png ) about the insident . 
  the missile exploded in syrian air space so i have to ask , what you think : it was `` legal '' shot ? 
  edit : about the excessive use of force - you ca n't punch the burglar in your house . 
  there were a [ map ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/a069/production/_86856014_russian_plane_shot_down_624.png ) about the incident . 
  the missile exploded in syrian airspace . 
  and still , it 's kill and you go to jail for first degree of murder . 
  you really ca n't say that to another one who is not threat to you . 
   the hometown of the prime minister who basically gave up his home to these refugees not happened [ yet ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1448342438112.html ) . 
  autumn after that and finally a new winter upsurge . 
  were n't saxony and bavaria kingdoms either ? 
  not sure did they have electoral rights . 
  ckii+euiv are my only sources on this . 
  just took it as a big european economy . 
  i do n't really think it is good way to compare economies when trying to remember different brands . 
  before i kneel to your leader and yell him king in the north , can we again call the western lapland as a finnish soil ? 
   my lords !, 
  here is what i say to these two leaders !, 
  angela merkel is nothing to me , nor jean-claude juncker neither . 
  why should they rule over me and mine , from some flowery seat in south ? 
  what do they know of the bothnia or the lapland ? 
  even their gods are wrong . 
  why should n't we rule ourselves again ? 
  it was the euro we bowed to and now the euro is dead !, 
  there sits the only king i mean to bend my knee to . 
  the king in the north !, 
  since the route to norway and finland are blocked from south they would stay to denmark , right ? 
  just to be fair . 
  if cars are not accepted i could n't name five british brands in one minute . 
  i figured out royal dutch shell but is n't it half dutch right ? 
  then i checked [ ftse 100 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ftse_100_index ) and i saw some brands what i am familiar with but most of them are companies what i do n't recognize . 
  the odds must be less than 1 % for that .
