  well . 
  harsh treatment will work , if there are enough points for it . 
  you can say it straight . 
  no need to dodge the truth that you only wish to buy cheap liquor from tallinn . 
  [ a polar ekku ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxcgmfaund8&amp;feature=plcp ) hibernates under the snow like the bears on the winter . 
  i see your point but if they are not registered - finland have to register them . 
  sweden should do it already but some reason ( we know why ) they have n't done that . 
  before sweden , denmark/germany/austria / hungary/serbia/fyrom / greece/turkey should have done that but incase not , first country who notices them have to do it . 
  basically j\u00f6rgen svensson from stockholm have a right for own asylum application and he could come to finnish borders and claim it . 
  finnish official would laugh him off though but j\u00f6rgen have a right for the application . 
  anyway , glad we have countries hungary who follow the rules . 
  anyone can get in if they apply asylum but keep others out . 
  no really point on that . 
  finland is last country where they can come and all who come here will pledge asylum . 
  only those who have active asylum process going in other countries could be turned away but the big chunk who are moving in sweden illegal are still able to get in . 
  cheers . 
  i uninstalled ghostery and i am trying disconnect . 
  there were some things on ghostery which speaks against using it but i do n't remember what those were exactly . 
  anyway , i am using it . 
  i have been only 4 flights in my lifetime , none of them with norwegian either ryanair . 
  i am sourcing to [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10127355/anger-over-norwegians-long-haul-service.html ) . 
  bit old - they might be better now . 
  it 's just flight . 
  a bit of fees will make some extra . 
  would you like to have luggage in cargo ? 
  remember to carry credid card if you wish to go wc or have a blanket on flight . 
  social welfare and healt care reform have been on the table really long time . 
  [ katainen cabinet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katainen_cabinet ) from 2011 were supposed to make the reform but it crashed several times . 
  [ a bit information ] ( http://stm.fi/sote-uudistus?p_p_id=56_instance_iot1fzedezrp&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=5&amp;_56_instance_iot1fzedezrp_languageid=en_us ) on the website of ministry of social affairs and healt . 
  -- edit : prime minister juha sipil\u00e4 , centre party , gave ultimatum to the head of national coalition party , current minister of finance , alexander stubb that they have to accept 18 regions . 
  national coalition party favours 5 regions but are ready to bend for 9-12 regions . 
  alexander stubb said that they ca n't support 18 regions and they will not back off this . 
  alexander stubb also mentioned that [ they are not leaving the cabinet ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015110520621025_uu.shtml ) by themselves . 
  prime minister juha sipil\u00e4 keeps it likely that he will meet the president sauli niinist\u00f6 tomorrow and they will talk about the future of his coalition . 
  the finns support centre party . 
  in case of that there will be 2 different options : 1 ) no new elections but juha sipil\u00e4 throws ncp over the board and takes swedish people 's party of finland and christian democrats to coalition . 
  that would mean [ weak 101/199 majority ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1446699003148.html ) on the government ( chairman does n't vote , part of the finns , 102/200 when calculating the chairman ) . 
  social democratic party is not ready for government without new elections but it is still option . 
  2 ) new elections could be risk since current cabinet have been taking a lot of shit when handling current economic crisis . 
  sdp who lost a lot of seats in last elections have been gaining a lot of votes on the new polls . 
  there might be risk that new head of cabinet would be called as prime minister antti rinne , sdp . 
  the finns would lose half of their seats according to the [ new polls ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/perussuomalaisten_syoksy_jatkuu_sdpn_kannatus_pomppasi_taas/8430304 ) . 
  their supporters are not happy for recent decisions about the migrant and economic crisises . 
  [ experts from ministry of social affairs and healt favours 9-12 regions ] ( http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/a1446696797413 ) . 
  18 regions would mean that there would be way too many regions without enough population and again it would also mean constitutional legal limbo ( where the proposition made by prime minister jyrki katainen , ncp , fell ) . 
  the center party supports more regions because their supporters come from the regions and it would mean [ more power and wealth to their party ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/paakirjoitus/2015110520617228_pk.shtml ) in regions . 
  -- wall of text . 
  sorry for rough up english language . 
  i did n't pass my [ matriculation exams on english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matriculation_exam_\\ ( finland \\ ) ) . 
   certain areas like dvorce and troja couple of years ago i visited in prague and i wondered with my friends how boring these areas are by name . 
  prague 2 , prague 6 etc , my hotel located in prague 9 close to o2 but does those areas have proper names ? 
  as a finn i have to say that baseball is national sport in finland . 
  for example [ 2011 finals in youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14l5flhar4q ) !, 
  generally if you are speaking about the wealth and you use the decimals , use only 2 decimals . 
  oh , thanks for the info , i did n't really check the url address . 
  fun fact : swedish flag comes from [ finland-proper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_proper_ ( historical_province ) [ coat-of-arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southwest_finland#/media/file:varsinais-suomen.vaakuna.svg ) . 
  actually finland is getting less and less new migrants every day . 
  according to our media . 
  that is exact reason why in finland , builder is called as `` kirvesmies - axeman '' . 
  i have seen some russian text written with latin alphabeth . 
  is the same possible with greek language ? 
  like writing '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 '' as `` tpexw '' or something similar . 
  denmark would back us with registering all the migrants who enters to denmark ... 
  none uses finland to get into another country . 
  we are last country where migrants are able to move . 
  in case of hungary , migrants wish to use hungarian soil move to austria . 
  best idea to stop migrants would be to send finnish border guards to denmark/sweden bridge ( should not be problem since when obama visited in norway , norwegian border guards were temporally inside finnish areas doing their job ) and if they wish to enter , migrants have to apply asylum instantly . 
   just because iraq was in danger of starvation and this was from what i understand averted does n't mean anyone actually starved . 
   close to starvation it is interesting to not call iraq situation at the 90 's as starvation . 
  let me copy a bit of [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/starvation ) to you : `` starvation is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake . '', 
  it is really interesting to not call 1200 kcal daily energy intake as severe . 
   one single country that was close to starvation . 
  i gave you a map - check that . 
  even if there would be only one country in world what suffers for famine i am able to say that there are famine in the world . 
  with your logic i am not allowed to say that . 
  why i am not allowed to say that there are starvation in middle east if that country locates in middle-east ? 
   i do n't get why you are taking this so aggressively either . 
  i am frustrated because of you after all these posts . 
  first you blame me doing a claim what i did n't do . 
  you could n't even quote my words of that alleged claim when i asked . 
  you made a claim that there were not any starvation in middle-east but you did n't provide source for it - even i asked multiple times you did n't found anything to support your claims . 
  later when i provided the facts you tried to question them again without any counter source . 
  i am frustrated to argue a person who play with two rules , one for you and one for me . 
  you must have problems with reading . 
  [ gulf war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war ) took place in 2 august 1990 -- 28 february 1991 and there were peace until the [ iraq war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_war ) 20 march 2003 -- 18 december 2011 . 
  the un program food-for-oil were there to help in starvation in 1995 ( first shipment of food arrived may 1997 ) -2003 and that was n't wartime shortage anymore . 
  you asked me to provide source to middle east starvation and i did - you did not even try to raise any objections . 
  save your face and say `` okay , i stand corrected , there were starvation in middle-east '' . 
  may i ask why are fighting for this ? 
  you said that `` i challenged you '' ( i feel that i did n't do that ) so is this personal to you ? 
  are you refugee , descendant of refugee or just migrant from middle-east ? 
  is it hard to accept the truth that things were n't that good in iraq at the 90 's ? 
  it does n't matter for me but please do n't fight against the windmills like don quijote did in the book . 
   did you find anything to support your claims other than wartime shortages in one country ? 
  then this conversation is finished . 
  that sounds desperate excuse to get away from the debate you are loosing . 
  since i have to do all the work for you . 
  more un sources .
