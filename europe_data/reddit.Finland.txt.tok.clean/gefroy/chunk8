  actually according to that map it seems to be more severe than in iraq at the same time . 
  -- i wait you accept that you were wrong and say next in your reply :  til that people in the middle east starve ~ ~ ? ~ ~ !, 
  i also ask you to say that you are ignorant as you said about my passed away mother . 
  ice hockey and nothing more . 
  could n't find the english language either but the hunger strike in lahti actually happened . 
  [ asylum seekers on hunger strike in lahti , finland : '' when reporters went away , asylum seekers went to eat '' ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015100120449411_uu.shtml ) . 
  they ate traditional finnish thursday meal : [ pea soup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pea_soup ) . 
  so , found anything to undo my claims ( with an un sources ) ? 
  wow . 
  gulf war ended 1991 but i am speaking about the next decate in iraq . 
  us attacked again to iraq in 2003 and that was timen when they overthrown saddam hussein . 
  so i ca n't say that there is starvation in africa since there is n't starvation in ** every ** country ? 
  can i say that there are mountains in nordic countries even there is n't mountains in denmark ? 
  what is the logic on this ? 
   what is the implication of `` think about the children from africa/middle-east '' then ? 
  that i have to think children who live in africa/middle east when i eat . 
  edit . 
  i am on tablet so i missclick the save button way too fast . 
  anyway copypasted some un stuff to the another guy and it 's also a perfect answer for your question . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mz408/finland_to_tighten_line_on_iraqi_and_somali/cvjvng2 ) . 
  well , i did n't claim that they were starving . 
  even i asked from you - you could n't provide me the quote of my starvation claims . 
  only thing i claimed sure what my mother said and that is something i really ca n't proof . 
  since she is dead and i do n't have a record . 
  i only gave you wikipedia site that there were oil-for-food-program in iraq after gulf war . 
  name tells quite much but lets look closer . 
  [ un-website about the program ] ( http://www.un.org/depts/oip/background/inbrief.html )  food & medicine : between march 1997 and march 2003 , foodstuffs worth some $ 13 billion and medicines and health supplies worth over $ 2 billion , have been delivered to iraq . 
  the programme helped to improve the overall socio-economic condition of the iraqi people countrywide and prevented the further degradation of public services and infrastructure under sanctions . 
  ( economic sanctions were lifted on 22 may 2003 ) . 
  ** the nutritional value of the monthly food ration basket distributed countrywide almost doubled between 1996 and 2002 , from about 1,200 to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day . 
  ** malnutrition rates in 2002 in the centre/south of iraq were half those of 1996 among children under the age of five and the decline in malnutrition rates was even greater in the three northern governorates . 
  is that enought for starving ? 
  you can survive with that some time , but years ? 
  does n't sound healthy . 
  please do n't ask me to find proof what kind of long time effects that would have to the human body since i am not a doctor . 
  the fact sheet  the mission visited iraq from 10 to 17 march 1991 and reported that `` the iraqi people may soon face a further imminent catastrophe , which could include epidemic and famine , if massive life-supporting needs are not rapidly met . '', 
   although established in april 1995 , the implementation of the programme started only in december 1996 , after the signing of the memorandum of understanding ( mou ) between the united nations and the government of iraq on 20 may 1996 ( s/1996/356 ) . 
  the first oil was exported under the programme in december 1996 and the first shipment of supplies arrived under the programme in march 1997 . 
  so the question is , when did the food rations decease that low between 1991 and 1997 ? 
  i ca n't find answer for that question but since you are an sure that there were not large scale starvation i assume you can proof that it was only temporal . 
  [ un news section says ] ( http://www.un.org/news/dh/iraq/oip/facts-oilforfood.htm )  ** humanitarian relief operation ** the oil-for-food programme achieved its core mission of providing humanitarian relief to 27 million iraqis . 
  caloric intake rose by 83 percent , while malnutrition rates in much of the country were cut by half , and some 76,500 mines were cleared . 
  on the health front , enough medicines and vaccines were imported to eradicate polio and drastically reduce other often deadly communicable diseases , including cholera , malaria , measles , mumps , meningitis and tuberculosis . 
  the capacity to undertake major surgeries increased by 40 per cent in the centre and south of iraq . 
  why should i try to proof something i have not claimed . 
  you are pretty sure that i said that there are starvation in middle-east . 
  please quote that text so i can also see that . 
  in the other hand you said that there were no any starvation that area . 
  oh there were two of you now . 
  sorry , i though i were speaking to that swede . 
  i did n't check the usernames . 
  i did n't say that they starve . 
  originally i said that why mom taught to me that i have to eat everything with words : `` think about the children from africa/middle-east '' . 
  but if you are seeing on my comments something what i refer to starving , please quote my text . 
  i ca n't answer that question since i am not familiar to subject . 
  you are the one here who is telling me the `` facts '' without sources . 
  show me something what refers to your claims . 
  you are making kinda wild assumptions here . 
  i only said : `` my mom taught me that i have to eat everything - `` think the children who live in africa/middle-east '' . 
  but because you are that sure that there were no children in middle-east starving i would like to see some kind of source . 
  show me your facts . 
  and i do n't like you call me a liar and especially i do n't like when you call my mother , who has passed away , ignorant . 
  now i keep you just stupid person . 
  why you ask that from me ? 
  i am not an expert with food status in africa and in middle-east . 
  neither i 'm not trying to express such expert . 
  quite same if i ask from you `` what kind of food belorussian people tend to eat '' . 
  if you are interested about the food status in middle-east - wikipedia is good place to start . 
  if you ca n't find answer from that website i suggest you to look if there are some united nations reports available . 
  dunno , do you wish to fight about the semantics ? 
  i should ask that question from you because i did n't talk about the starving . 
  you did . 
  did the children starve in middle-east ? 
  when i was a kid there were ruler called saddam hussein who ruled the lands what used to belong to ancient kingdom of babylonia/assyria/etc . 
  his domain produced a lot of oil but the saddam hussein had a program with un : '' [ oil-for-food programme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil-for-food_programme ) '' and according to news sources un estimated that 60 % of iraqis were totally dependent on the program at the year of 2003 . 
  that program existed 1995-2003 . 
  2 % of migrants in finland comes from syria . 
  most of them comes from iraq . 
  [ situation in iraq september 2015 map ] ( https://pietervanostaeyen.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2000px-iraq19.png ) shows that large areas are under the control of isis but much larger area is under control of goverment . 
  i though that their government is not filled with radical islamist who behead their heads . 
  my mom taught me that i have to eat everything - `` think the children who live in africa/middle-east '' . 
  yesterday it was sub zero here in finland at the morning . 
  i am really surprised that nothing really happened after us get caught spying europeans . 
  why there were n't any charges against the cia bosses etc ? 
  just to be fair , i know there were some european countries who practiced spying but did my country ( finland ) practice . 
  why i ca n't have justice if my internet data was on their watch list ? 
   wtf is that a lake ? 
  - yes  people walking in a half-frozen lake ? 
  - they are skiing . 
  there could be leak on ice - only a bit of water lies on the ice . 
   is that ` safe ' ? 
  [ depends how thick the ice is at the moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69_xemmn-wk ) . 
  danish are just mad since they are not living in scandinavia . 
  denmark locates behind the sea but part of finland locates in the peninsula . 
   they had over six million soldiers fighting germany link led to the winter war , not continuation war . 
  yeh . 
  coming home tomorrow from my holiday . 
  ck2 is good game indeed . 
  but i ca n't see it as fun in mp than euiv . 
  you got one already ?
