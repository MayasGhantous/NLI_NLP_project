  can we have another for slovakia-slovenia and chechnya-czechia please . 
  18 should be a limit . 
  sure . 
  after the terrible and evil part left . 
  there is a country who were in war against all of those three at the same time . 
  a small democratic country called finland . 
   authorities estimate that if they continue working at the current rate , it could take anywhere from 300 to 700 years to complete . 
  the `` tannu what '' comment i made was a reference to the game / u/zsmg mentioned . 
  hearts of iron is a grand strategy game series - hearts of iron 4 released on 6.6.2016 . 
  in game ussr have option to intergate tannu tuva to the soviet union . 
  when the event happens , there will be news screen pop-up what tells about the event in history . 
  the pop-up have `` ok '' button with text `` tannu what ? '', 
   any reliable source ? 
  have you heard about the [ finnish democratic republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) ? 
  it was a puppet goverment led by otto-wille kuusinen and other finnish communists who left finland after lost civil war in 1918 . 
  soviet union declared terijoki goverment only legal goverment in finland . 
  terijoki is small town on border between the countries - soviet union conquered that town relatively fast . 
  goal was to `` restore '' areas for finnish democratic republic . 
  the map shows a small piece of land what was supposed cede to russian ssr and all of karelia to future finnish democratic republic . 
  like in case of baltics . 
  soviet union wanted whole country . 
  the plan was to march into helsinki in two weeks and conquer the country before stalin 's birthday . 
  tannu what ? 
  did soviet union reach their wargoals ? 
  no did soviet union gain name paper as a victor ? 
  yes, 
   has anyone voluntarily joined the ussr ? 
  @personal messaged .

  let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away . 
  let the old gefroy drown . 
  let his lungs fill with sea water , let the fish eat the scales off his eyes . 
  what is dead may never die , but rises again , harder and stronger . 
  what is dead may never die !, 
  -- his royal majesty the king of portugal and castile attends and will personally command his royal portuguese navy to the glory . 
  his royal majesty declares :  we are small nation and we might have a small army and navy - but we will replace raw power with our willpower . 
  so shall we be victorious !, 
  the king of portugal , castile , aragon and the algarves , the lord of brazil and venezuela will be there . 
  well . 
  germans did more good to us so we can forget what happened in last months . 
  good buddies in general . 
  the thing is . 
  finland never been in euros , neither in the worlds ... 
  indeed . 
  you can expand your colonies and enjoy easy life under my protective wings . 
  iberian union, 
  castile is taken cared . 
  in next week you serve your lord , the king of portugal , castile , aragon and the algarves , the lord of brazil and venezuela , as a viceroy . 
  his most faithful majesty , king manuel i of portugal and the algarves , who is blessed with the wisdom will continue to explore the seas and spread the joy of the christendom to the natives in west . 
  savoy will be there . 
  at this time i do n't lose provinces after i got them !, 
  please do n't use word `` everywhere '' because it is not [ `` everywhere '' ] ( http://www.eliteprospects.com/draftcenter.php?year=2016&amp;layout=&amp;ranking=rank6 ) . 
  would be my first mp game so i might suck . 
  seems like savoy is free .

  using same nickname in steam, 
  ireland have been doing with their economy really well after last recession .

  on some things uk is like a developing country . 
  housing seems to be one . 
  yeh . 
  there are already a horror stories how companies called monsanto works . 
  once a farmer boughts seeds , the surplus seeds cant ' t be used in next year and also the new harvest ca n't be used as a seeds in future . 
   scandinavia is a culutural region , not geographic . 
  there is cultural region and there is geographical region . 
  keywords have been here ` the western part of lappland ' - not whole of finland . 
  i do n't know what kind of map you have but i do n't see land connection from denmark to scandinavian peninsula . 
  did someone talk about synonyms ? 
  we agree that finland is not part of cultural sphrere of scandinavia but on same time fact is denmark does n't locate in skandinavia - western lappland in finland locates . 
  incorrect and correct at same time . 
  it 's called for scanfinavian peninsula for reason . 
  denmark doeas n't have land on peninsula anymore since losing scania to sweden hundreds of years ago but western lappland is part of peninsula . 
  for cultural viewpoint you are right . 
  really . 
  what have you done to the cucumber ? 
  salt ? 
  bologna locates inland so it 's fresh water . 
  does n't the water in venice ( where most of canals locate ) come from river instead of the tide ? 
  there should not be salt in water and thus this in air . 
  i think a public building inspector would have a stroke in finland if he would see canal next to building . 
  there must be a lot of moisture inside of building what cause the grow of mold spores . 
   that is fresh and usually hand-made egg-and-flour pasta strips served with a ~ ~ minced meat sauce ~ ~ * ketchup * slow ~ ~ cooked for at least three to four hours ~ ~ * boiled for five to ten minutes * . 
  ftfy, 
  they did n't want more tanks because tanks are obsolete but because they have already more than enough in reserve . 
  not all wars are hold in deserts where one side have 100 % air superioty . 
  but how about [ ceuta , islas chafarinas , melilla , pe\u00f1\u00f3n de alhucemas and pe\u00f1\u00f3n de v\u00e9lez de la gomera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plazas_de_soberan%c3%ada ) at moroccan coastline ? 
  so who you were again ? 
  i visited there 10 years ago as tourist and saw people jumping down from cliffs . 
  ca n't hear you from down there !, 
  what did you say again ? 
  it 's going to backfire here in finland . 
  we have here unlimited 4g connections with unlimited calls , sms and mms with ~ 25 $ cost . 
  because operators ca n't get payment from roaming -  they have to change unlimited plans to limited or increase payment .
