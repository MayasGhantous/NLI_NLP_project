  just pretend you like hockey and salmiakki vodka and you 've practically scored already . 
  i know what it 's like . 
  it took me two weeks in seattle to adopt the pnw accent . 
  my math teacher did n't find out until the finals that i was n't american even though i was one of the most active kids in class . 
  but yes , an american accent is just as attractive as an australian one here as long as you do n't play your cards entirely wrong . 
  oh yes . 
  it 's a multiplier . 
  if you 're nice , it triples the pussy , but it can also be very costly if you 're a douche . 
  but they come out laestadian .

  just flaunt your accent and give them a dash of american charm , and , who knows , you might be able to skip rules 1 and 2 . 
  i 'd say it 's both . 
  it 's the south 's fault for implementing it , and the national government 's fault for not just fully legalizing it already . 
  got almost too jealous for my own good . 
  it fucking better . 
  huh . 
  well , at least time is on our side . 
  i thought belgians and germans could buy in the south but other tourists could n't ? 
  it 's the government 's fault when it 's easier and cheaper to buy it from a darker-shade-of-gray market than legally . 
  they fucked it up . 
  except deez nutz . 
  same here . 
  it pretty much is . 
  `` strengthening ties '' is a code word for international booty calls . 
  what , that 's your studiebidrag ? 
  holy shit .

  so you 're saying non-eu members should get to pick all the raisins out of the bun and the eu should welcome the shafting with open arms ? 
  never go full retard , switzerland , never go full retard . 
  well , they are next to each other . 
  schr\u00f6dinger 's scandinavia : either an incredibly homogenous group of countries with utopian societies or an immigration-ridden hell hole about to be ruled over by shariah law . 
  pick the one that fits your narrative . 
  yes . 
  britain 's the real queen of this . 
  fucking arrows and shit . 
  the nordics are n't that different from each other . 
  as much as it pains me to say , sweden is actually not all shit . 
  it 's disgustingly liveable . 
  hold on to your seat . 
  here comes a real shocker : you can ( technically ) go to jail for blasphemy in germany , denmark , and iceland , among others . 
   poland  roads are superior pick one . 
  the law was practically so old that it was created to protect thor 's sanctity , not some weird christian god . 
  i know it is n't islamist terrorism but you still should n't forget about 2011 . 
  imagine looking in the mirror every morning and seeing a stranger . 
  and then having everybody laugh at you for it . 
  jeez . 
  oh , so cherry picking all the best performing ones . 
  well guess what , france is a burden on finland , maybe we should start there . 
  whatever it is , i want it . 
  a majority of people everywhere would like to pay less taxes . 
  also a majority would like to get more benefits . 
  this is the fundamental problem with direct democracy , so it should only be applied to social questions like gay marriage or legalization of recreational substances . 
  this , this , this , and this . 
  either you 're in or you 're out . 
  we 're letting norway and switzerland free ride with our eea and schengen too , so they should be thrown out as well . 
  ^ ( scotland should stay though . 
  they had nothing to do with this . ), 
  founding members of what ? 
  at , se , and fi did n't join the eu until 1995 . 
  as my fellow nords pointed out , your claim remains completely baseless until you provide some source or explanation . 
  going for that short con . 
  i too am for free trade but when the possible outcome can range from ever-so-slightly possible to a catastrophe that will destroy europe as we know it , i ca n't help but be pessimistic . 
  i 'm 100 % against the mass collection of private data because even the head of nsa has had to admit in front of congress that their multi-billion program has succeeded in only one terrorist case . 
  a case where a somalian-born cab driver sent $ 7000 to al-shabaab . 
  boy , does that make me feel safe . 
  the only things left to privatize in finland are education and healthcare . 
  with our spread-out population , neither of those are profitable enough to be privatized without massive cuts to service or a gigantic hike in prices . 
  also , when it comes to looks , i wish he had started working for colgate instead of trying to represent the people . 
  i sincerely hope my sarcasm radar is broken . 
  also pro-ttp , pro-nsa , and pro-privatization . 
  except she has had a ton of plastic surgery to look more non-s\u00e1mi . 
  this . 
  the kokkari youth is right wing as fuck . 
  when a party 66 % of the people oppose gets 50 % of the seats , you know you have a problem . 
  that 's not democracy . 
  ever thought how weird and arbitrary 18 is ? 
  20 would be a nice , round number , and it 's slightly closer to complete brain development . 
  not that i 'd be for raising the age of majority to 20 , but it 's just something to think about . 
  eh , i do n't know . 
  it 's what people from other parts of finland think helsinki is like . 
  while the depiction is n't entirely incorrect , it 's quite the caricature . 
  it 's exactly people like you our fellow frisian was referring to . 
   / r/european this seems to be their top post : https://i.imgur.com/0gozo6p.jpg that 's just ... beautiful . 
  nice , unadulterated idiocy . 
  yeah , he was shocked yesterday when he found out . 
  well , ai n't that \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 !, 
  a lot of the immigrants in thailand are probably chinese . 
  a lion 's share of the thai population is actually ethnically chinese , but they tend to integrate really well and speak the language .

  if it 's got rubber in it , it 's made by nokia . 
  it 's our national flower , actually .
