  congratulations , you just bought 1000 liters of milk . 
  one good argument that i 've heard is that if you crack down on guns so hard that the street price of an assault rifle becomes $ 30,000 , what crime are you going to need a gun for when you already have $ 30,000 to waste ? 
  i get having a gun in your home for protection , but it has to be locked in a safe to 1 ) avoid rash decisions and 2 ) keep it away from kids . 
  also you do n't need assault rifles to protect yourself from burglars , they 're called * assault * rifles for a reason . 
  you 're not supposed to kill the guy , that 's murder , unless he tries to kill you first .

  i guess i 've overestimated the amount of electricity wind power can produce . 
  i agree , there 's still tons of room for improvement , but it 's still the best drug legislation on the planet . 
  way better than finland where everybody gets a criminal record and maybe even six months in prison . 
  while colorado has better cannabis laws than holland ( washington 's law sucks but , hey , it 's still legal so that 's good ) , when it comes to other drugs , the us is still a hell hole . 
  for example , dutch cops wo n't make your life too difficult for a small amount of acid , and they let you test your drugs in order to minimize harm to users . 
  all shrooms are very much illegal in colorado too . 
  if you look past the imperfections , the fact that you guys accept the reality that drugs are n't going anywhere and that minimizing the risks and helping addicts is way better than trying to ban them at all costs , including human lives , that 's what makes it sane .

  decriminalization = / = legalization . 
  decriminalization means that you no longer have the risk of having to serve a prison sentence for simple possession of small personal amounts like you do in finland , sweden , and norway . 
  depenalization would mean getting rid of fines too but still listing it as technically illegal , and legalization would completely erase its illegal status altogether .
