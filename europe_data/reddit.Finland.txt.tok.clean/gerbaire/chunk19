  / u/nevarix is right . 
  `` tyst '' means quiet in swedish , but it 's just a coincidence . 
  both `` tysk '' and `` deutsch '' come from the proto-germanic root `` theosc . '', 
  that 's where the word came from . 
  pretty much all european peoples named germany after whatever german tribe was closest to them . 
  except the poles who named them mutes for being the only neighboring people unable to speak with them . 
  `` saksan '' in this case means `` of germany . '', 
  `` german '' can either be `` saksa '' or `` saksalainen , '' depending on whether it 's the language or the ethnicity we 're talking about . 
  i 'm sure you would . 
  still does n't mean i can realistically expect you and all of your countrymen to know how to order a ham and cheese sandwich in your sleep . 
  i 've found that the french seem to have terrible delusions about the importance of their language . 
  no one outside of france , belgium , and switzerland gives two shits about it . 
  it 's a language with horrific grammar and near-impossible pronunciation , and frankly , it 's not a fun or even useful language to learn . 
  i studied it for ten years , i would know . 
  i 'm glad it 's over . 
  the attitude seems to be the biggest problem , though . 
  i was fourteen when i last traveled to paris , and i found it absolutely disturbing how the locals would straight up decline to acknowledge my existence if i tried to talk to them in english , and then they 'd laugh at me for trying again with my faulty french . 
  bitch , i speak more languages than you do but i 'm still doing it all wrong . 
  i was a fucking kid , give me a break !, 
  french is n't any fancier or more civilized than , say , polish , so you 're not above anyone else . 
  get over it . 
  come on over to finland . 
  ca n't help if you do n't speak a word of finnish or swedish , you still do n't get service . 
  when in rome , right ? 
  i can understand both just fine . 
  truly an attra *** xxchckh *** tive a *** xxchckh *** cent . 
  what are you saying ? 
  they might be slightly isolationist and eccentric , but they 're our isolationists . 
  all hail / r/ankdammen . 
  depends on if i 'd like to go for a more familiar choice ( sthlm ) , something a little different ( adam ) , or somewhere in between ( cph ) . 
  only a lot ? 
  it 's basically the nl 's long-lost scandinavian twin brother . 
  you 'd fit right in here in helsinki . 
  everything north of vantaa is basically lapland . 
  yl\u00e4femma !, 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  no tunnel . 
  you guys are weird . 
  and gross . 
  this . 
  everything south of the paris-berlin axle is way too hot in the summer . 
  not in finland it ai n't . 
  here it 's h\u00f6gsvenska all the way . 
  norwegian is historically a west scandinavian language . 
  danish just happened to become the lingua franca between the various dialects and its elements got integrated into a more standardized norwegian . 
  it 's what it was that counts in linguistics , not what it 's become . 
  the same applies to english : it used to be a germanic language just like any other but now its become heavily latinized , but it 's undoubtedly a germanic tongue . 
  we could and we should ( as long as the eu does n't have its own army ) but we wo n't and that 's the sad part . 
  now that 's an idea i can get behind . 
  let 's dig up turku and dump it in the sea . 
  we should also keep pumping water from the west to the east side of the dam and have the shit water climb up all the way to the streets in st petersburg . 
  it 's been incredibly stupid we 've become even this heavily reliant on trade with russia . 
  if history has ever taught us anything it 's that russia is not to be trusted . 
  ever . 
  good thing you did that in a game and not irl . 
  to be fair , you do need a tank for those roads . 
  like damn . 
  the graphics are great but gameplay is rather tedious . 
  nah , i heard the fountain at sergels torg in stockholm has been feeling a little lonely lately . 
  nah man , now you 're giving too much credit . 
  paradox is a swedish company and they developed europa universalis . 
  they 're also the distributor to cities skylines , but the game itself was devved by colossal order , a small finnish studio of 13 people . 
  i know , technicalities ... 
  hey now !, 
  cities skylines is a finnish game . 
  it 's only published by a swedish company . 
  yup . 
  i 'm addicted to it already . 
  the funny thing is , i do n't even own the game yet . 
  we 're above sweden . 
  shut up , it 's time to party . 
  did i. . . ? 
  did i just understand everything ? 
  this . 
  i hardly even speak a word of estonian , but i remember the lyrics after all these years . 
  the swedish . 
  this absolutely blows my mind . 
  i never carry cash , ever . 
  fuck coins in particular . 
  you 've got quite the nerve telling people what to do , west spain . 
  as trees grow , they take in carbon , form sugars and oxygen , and grow in size . 
  trees also free up the same carbon once they die . 
  burning them is just another way to kill the trees and release the carbon . 
  you 're right , trees do n't sit there idle : some of them grow , some of them die . 
  in a natural state , the growth and the death balance each other out . 
  introducing new carbon , which has previously been underneath , to the atmosphere is what 's problematic . 
  you 're also right about carbon not being magically created nor it disappearing . 
  but we need to stop it from leaving where it 's stored underground and entering the atmosphere in greater amounts . 
  that 's why we should recycle the carbon in our ecosystem ( trees and atmosphere ) instead of bringing more of it from outside our ecosystem ( underground ) . 
  burning coal changes the carbon 's location from a non-problematic place underground to a problematic place in the sky , entering the ecosystem it had previously been kept away from . 
  no trees will appear to bind it up unless we plant them , the existing ones are already busy recycling their buddies ' carbons . 
  now , we can take advantage of the trees ' inevitable death , and have it recycled back into new trees . 
  leave the coal carbon in the ground , and recycle what you 've already got . 
  it 's like dams : water goes through , it evaporates later on , and it comes back as rain . 
  do n't bring new water from outer space to run the dams , that 's too much water . 
  you still have n't understood the concept , it seems . 
  do n't worry , though , i drew [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/nles5rq ) for you . 
  as long as you do n't burn trees faster than the rate they renew themselves , it 's carbon-neutral . 
  i 'm not at all following you and your logic . 
  just watch this or something : http://youtu.be/dq-civjudks,
