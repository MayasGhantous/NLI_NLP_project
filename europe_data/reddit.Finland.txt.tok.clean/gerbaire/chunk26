  yes please . 
  we need to strengthen european defense instead of relying on nato . 
  it 's not really of any use to boost exports when you * have * no exports to boost . 
  besides , finland is incredibly competitive as is . 
  \\ ^ this . 
  jesus fucking christ , the mark was the worst . 
  `` regaining competitiveness '' would n't help , seeing that both of our chief exports , nokia and paper , are dead . 
  you betcha . 
  some context : ** this will never go through . 
  ** this citizens ' initiative was written by a center party representative whom everybody dislikes , and the finnish parliament is very pro-euro . 
  finland had a very tough time with the finnish mark which was extremely unstable due to currency speculation and was subject to tons of devaluations . 
  our financial situation would be way worse with a small currency that is expensive to maintain and would inflate in an instant . 
  yup , but the demand not so much . 
  china and ipads killed both exports . 
  we 'd be way worse off with an unstable , small currency with both of our chief exports ( nokia and paper ) gone . 
  but for what price ? 
  definitely not 13 $ / month . 
  i 've lived in the us . 
  most definitely not . 
  he dun fucked up . 
  yeah , phone subscriptions are pretty much the only thing about finland i 'm going to miss when i move abroad . 
  i pay 13 $ / month of fast unlimited 3g . 
  `` eet 's only a game , why you heff to be mad ? '', 
  and he is n't wrong . 
  it still is one of the wealthiest regions , rivaling with uusimaa . 
  yes . 
  \u00c5land , what the fuck ? 
  i guess the area being full of large cities , there are no tight-knit communities and income inequality tends to be larger in large urban areas . 
  do n't care for either , but yes . 
  grocery stores and restaurants seem to be ~ 10 % or so cheaper . 
  hey dough !, 
  sweden is way cheaper . 
  it 's weird . 
  stockholm is exactly like helsinki . 
  except it totally is n't helsinki . 
  and everybody speaks swedish ( and the wrong kind at that ) . 
  and vowels . 
  we have a lot of potential customers in poland . 
  exactly . 
  it 's popular because it 's catchy . 
  sure , it 's made out of very generic building blocks , but it works . 
  just like anything that contains tons of sugar and fat tastes godly . 
  are you sure it was ineffective ? 
  i mean , have you seen any witches recently ?

   anywhere in the northern states , except dakotas you got ohio , congratulations !, 
  good investment . 
  i do n't know how it is in belgium , but the guards at the gates in finnish military bases are unarmed . 
  it 's not like someone 's waiting for an attacker with a finger on the trigger . 
  maybe you could take some of ours ? 
  i agree with this sentiment .

  just because most polygamist relationships are nonconsensual , it does n't illegitimize those that are . 
  i see no point in mentioning this . 
  i did say it needs to be consensual . 
  of course , if it 's all consensual . 
  same goes for polyadoption . 
  if one parent is ok and two parents is even better , then porqu\u00e9 no los tres ? 
  laponia streches over both countries . 
  it 's practically a historical name for lapland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laponia_ ( historical_province ), 
  ostrobothnians ca n't speak neither finnish nor swedish . 
  it 's weird . 
  * r\u00f8\u00f8\u00f8\u00f8\u00f8\u00f8\u00f8v *, 
  in america , corporations are people . 
  that 's one more issue sanders would like to address . 
  er mah gerd , murslerms !!, 
  funny how you bring up the bias of my sources while you cite an article that does not refer to any reputable or fair study . 
  this is a perfect example of confirmation bias where you disregard thousands of pieces of evidence to find a false testimony that `` proves '' the contrary . 
  just google `` marijuana bronchodilator '' and be amazed . 
  here 's something to get started on : http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/747982_3 ps : i do not know a single person who mixes cannabis with tobacco . 
  everybody i know knows that its gross and unhealthy . 
  your anecdotal evidence against mine . 
  pps : while reading the posting history of the person above , i realized how they drop words like the n-word like it 's nothing . 
  this is nothing but a telltale sign of the intelligence of the poster i 'm replying to . 
  this discussion is n't probably going to lead anywhere . 
  a person unable to learn and grasp the concept of humility is most likely unable to comprehend more complex concepts such as actual source critique and confirmation bias, 
  well , the thing is , you * do n't * know what you are talking about . 
  while weed might contain 4 times the amount of tar , it 's a bronchodilator , meaning that the bronchioles in your lungs expand , and the tar is n't trapped . 
  tobacco is the opposite : it makes the bronchioles shrink temporarily , trapping the tar and making it accumulate over time . 
  tobacco is also radioactive , causing cell mutations in the lungs , while marijuana is n't significantly so . 
  it 's important to notice that the average marijuana user does n't smoke even 1/4 of what an average tobacco user does . 
  marijuana can not be linked to major lung damage over time , studies show . 
  the flemish , even though their dialect is the `` softest '' variant of dutch , sound very guttural . 
  also guttural languages , wind turbines , and weed . 
  and with us , apparently . 
  wtf . 
  d'awww . 
  fuck this shit . 
  aladobi in finnish . 
  not at all common or traditional though . 
  it keim sam stoun , truu timo 's siit , ap , ap in ti \u00e4\u00e4s of timo . 
  just the artists . 
  i 'm surprised he was n't von trier . 
  the cold war is back on , nukes have n't disappeared , and russia is still invading and occupying its neighbors . 
  how is it different now ? 
  experts in finlandization for sure . 
  do you really want to be left alone next to an unpredictable country that has jumped into 3 wars within the past 8 years without a word of warning ? 
  do you really ?
