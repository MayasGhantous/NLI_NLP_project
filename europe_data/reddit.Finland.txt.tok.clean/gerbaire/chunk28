  and it 's only two pages out of a travel book that has otherwise very normal content . 
  literally no clue . 
  i just read it at my neighbor 's place to kill the boredom until i spotted that part . 
  can confirm . 
  when you 're tripping with your child , you want to be sure you get the dosage right . 
  well , he is ukrainian . 
  source ? 
  finnish is good at conserving proto-germanic words , like kuningas and armas , not the other way round . 
  at least wiktionary claims that * hamara has an indo-european origin . 
  yes , putin did but that was only a few years ago . 
  but it 's not at all widely acknowledged in russia or taught in schools . 
  just look at the russian wiki article for it . 
  last time i checked , it said something along the lines of `` there is a difference in opinion who was really behind it all but there was probably finnish artillery near the border . '', 
  mainila too . 
  wars are started by pulling this shit . 
  and the only response you get is `` xaxaxa cyka . '', 
  of zwemt in de grachten . 
  fan int ' hell\u00e4\u00e4 . 
  source . 
  to be fair , there 's never good * anything * in zuid-limburg . 
  good coffeeshops would never risk their reputations with material whose source they ca n't trust 100 % . 
  space can into poland . 
  living space , that is . 
  selfie soldiers checking into ukraine was a piece of golden investigative journalism . 
  people really think america is eco-friendly ? 
  there is no comparison to be had between christians who reject secular laws and muslims who reject secular laws ? 
  interesting opinion , to say the least . 
  am like him , am boring . 
  can confirm . 
  you are what you ... smoke ? 
  even finnish christians spew this shit . 
  just the other year , we had p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen , who was then the minister of the interior ( you know , the one responsible for cops and stuff ) saying that people should rather follow the word of god , not so much the national laws , if they contradict one another . 
  i live in holland and i have n't seen any finnish-style salmiac here . 
  it tastes different here . 
  a bit like finnish licorice with regular old salt on it . 
  we have lower suicide levels . 
  vii mast diil vit it . 
  are you calling your sweet-ass zoute drops superior ? 
  allow me to laugh . 
  why only have one article when you can wrap your noun around two , like a sandwich : ** den ** sk\u00f6na katt ** en ** , ** det ** stora hus ** et **, 
  americans argue that weekend means the two ends of the week . 
  do n't worry , i heard vlad will gladly liberate you and a few of your terroritories . 
  i 'm referring to the paratroopers . 
  to be fair , half of all nordic people are black metal singers . 
  they literally did just that in crimea . 
  it 's not like it 's a new and relatively unknown development . 
  when is my turn ? 
  i 'm actually surprised that finland is n't any higher due to vaccine-related narcolepsy cases . 
  dutch is practically 40 % german , 30 % english , 20 % scandinavian , and 10 % weird vowel combinations that make even a finn go `` whaaa ? '', 
  i just got back and i most certainly did . 
  it 's one of my favorite places in europe , and i 'm really glad i live so close to it now . 
  i happened to walk past something half-decent in the hague just a few days ago : https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.076427,4.3248347,3a,75y,118.08h,91.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdtf-f3qefyolk3df4cp7tw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656, 
  huh . 
  i 'm going to delft in 15 minutes . 
  interesting clip . 
  that 's a thing ? 
  of course that 's a thing ... 
  goddamn walloons , man . 
  money can certainly buy happiness but it will never fill that empty void . 
  \u00c5tta and natt in swedish , unfortunately . 
  but interesting fact nevertheless . 
  do you have a source for your information ? 
  not that i do n't trust your research , i 'm just so intrigued that i want to read more about it . 
  yup . 
  but can someone from finland proper confirm that they say that because i 've * never * heard it ? 
  no bacteria can spread in temperatures that cold , so you 're good . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  there are oecd studies which clearly demonstrate that the less time people work , the more productive they are per hour . 
  also , gdp per capita is inversely proportional to hours worked . 
  we seem to be entering times where there simply is n't 8 hours of work for everybody . 
  shorter work days to combat unemployment and introducing basic income are becoming increasingly relevant ideas . 
  i guess people really did invest in eastern poland . 
  tj \u221e more like . 
  you 're right . 
  that 's even more decisive . 
  simply because they ca n't vote does n't mean that they do n't count towards anything . 
  especially saying that the majority of brits wanted to leave the eu without mentioning that only 37 % of all brits actually casted a leave vote is disingenuous . 
   we do n't vote for a leader as such , but we vote for mps of a political party . 
  accepting that the leader of this party will be our primeminister if they get a majority of seats in parliament . 
  that is exactly what i just said . 
  it 's a package deal . 
   the opposition party will always moan about the pm not having a mandate when an old leader steps down and a new ` unelected ' pm takes their place . 
  no one voted for this package deal . 
  she is unelected , and therefore lacks the mandate of the populace . 
   but it 's happened to both the tories and to labour in the past , it 's a fair system . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  you should n't be able to swap the person in charge , the most powerful position in the country , without consulting the electorate , does n't matter what party you belong to . 
  not even those who were n't old enough to vote ? 
  you know , the ones this decision affects by far the most ? 
  theresa may has never been the presumptive pm nominee in a general election . 
  tony blair and david cameron were chosen as pm because the parties they led won the elections . 
  theresa may just happened to be appointed to lead a nation of 60 million out of the blue simply because reasons . 
  whenever the pm steps down or is otherwise subject to a change , there should always be a reelection or a referendum on the new pm . 
  no , 52 % of the ones who voted . 
  only 37 % of the public . 
  i would understand banning veils that cover the face . 
  i 'm all for that . 
  there 's no reason to conceal your identity in public unless you really need to use a scarf to protect your face from frostbite . 
  but the burkini does n't even cover the face . 
  only your hair .
