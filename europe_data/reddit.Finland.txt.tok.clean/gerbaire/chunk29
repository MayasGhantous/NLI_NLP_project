  are brides banned from wearing veils at weddings too ? 
  overreaching , simple as that . 
  i 'm dumb , i do n't get it . 
  / r/mapswithoutnz, 
  i bought a carton of milk earlier today . 
  except it was actually washing detergent , not milk , regardless of what it says on the carton . 
  i really wanted to make chocolate milk but the washing detergent is really good detergent so i have nothing to complain about . 
  you 're triggering me very hard right now . 
  \\  finland \\  mountains pick one . 
  norway gib halti plx ), 
  no duh , but the level of snobbery is a new phenomenon . 
  no one really cared what beer they were drinking as long as it was a combination of hops , yeast , and water . 
  but craft beer being a thing is quite recent in finland . 
  before , everyone was happy drinking lapin kulta , koff , and karjala but now every young urbanite has become a beer snob . 
  there 's something wrong . 
  finland 's always been number one but we 're not even on the list . 
  people are upvoting this comment ? 
  what is happening to / r/europe ? 
  sure , no denying that , but why are they included in the poll ? 
  including norway . 
  so was albania less-bad or a lot worse ? 
  the first point technically applies to finnish too . 
  the germanic `` joo '' just happens to be gaining ground . 
  no one 's saying people should unlearn english . 
  it 's all about promoting bilingualism and national heritage . 
  i 've been to all three of those places without having spent a single night in switzerland . 
  no , i even asked once i got down to the village .

  they 're not . 
  it 's just right wing feelgood . 
  eh , not really . 
  we had some growth last year , but i think brexit is causing us to go below zero again . 
  nope . 
  here 's two vacation pics from milna and maslinica in july 2013 . https://imgur.com/a/s6ktf wimbledon was in the beginning of july , right when we were there . 
  how widespread is polish still outside of vilnius ? 
  did the ussr affect it at all ? 
  it 's really interesting . 
  i was in croatia in 2013 . 
  i was hiking at the castle ruins in hvar and i kept hearing loud-ass cheers coming from the town . 
  turns out they watch every djokovic game and cheer when the opponent scores points . 
  omg finally someone from greece on this sub !, 
  how do you feel about coming from a corrupt country that 's asking for handouts ? 
  plus buying a tesla makes ecological sense there . 
  your energy supply is 90 % co2-free hydro . 
   extrapolating anti-russian activists being shut down to the whole population and make it about nation/race is dishonest . 
  dissent and suppressing popular opinion is oppression . 
  it affects all crimean tatars . 
  even their flag has the ukrainian colors out of thankfulness for the ukrainian government for letting them return , so it 's not a fringe group of people who feel this way like you paint it to be . 
  ebin, 
  1 ) firstly , crimean tatars have lived in crimea for centuries . 
  slavs are a more recent introduction . 
  secondly , the word `` slav '' comes from proto-slavic . 
  `` slovo '' used to mean `` word , '' which contrasts `` nemts '' meaning `` mute '' , a word for foreigners . 
  furthermore , the turkish and crimean tatar words for `` slave '' are `` kul '' and `` qul '' respectively . 
  the use of the word `` slav '' for `` slave '' came from the byzantine greeks . 
  2 ) really ? 
  really ?

  karelia is part of russia because finland has accepted the loss of territory and so has the international community . 
  that is not the case between ukraine and crimea . 
  nor is there a reason to change that as long as there is no valid referendum . 
  he said the fuel would be cheap . 
  norwegian oil is not cheap . 
  i never argued about the de facto status . 
  but we should n't just accept their claim for it and concede to their violent takeover of the peninsula . 
  i know i wo n't recognize crimea as russian until 1 ) there is a fair referendum and 2 ) the right of the crimean tatars to their ancestral homeland is secured . 
  this is pure speculation until we find out for real . 
  this guy needs to stop painting crimea with the same color as russia . 
  we ca n't accept the illegal referendum . 
  the local population has to get to decide in a * free * vote . 
  not really , but i wish there was . 
  we really need to hit 2 % . 
  norway is n't a member of opec . 
  but that accent though . 
  lex is latin for law , so yes . 
  no , they do n't . 
  combining a strawman with the slippery slope fallacy is truly an art form .

  he hated turks and arabs and was a fan of breivik . 
  islam had nothing to do with it . 
  not all mass killings or shooting rampages are terrorist attacks . 
  the munich shooter was n't -- as far as we know -- connected to any terrorist network nor was his goal to instill fear in the german people . 
  he just wanted to kill people . 
  am from helsinki . 
  can confirm . 
  speak for yourself . 
  if you painted that with a pure white , it could actually look decent . 
  controlling free speech * in order to * control the masses . 
  the irony lies in the fact that twitter has been on-and-off banned in turkey because erdowang does n't like free speech . 
  anybody who could 've put a better campaign together . 
  i find it extremely undemocratic how a pm can raise to power like this completely unelected . 
  i 'm sure there would have been plenty of people willing to take the job and with more favorable public image . 
  may just had the right party affiliation . 
  shit just got scary .
