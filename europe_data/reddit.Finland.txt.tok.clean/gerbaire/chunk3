  they look so un-finnish . 
  [ eh , ] ( http://imgur.com/at71w5c ) could be better , but i 'm not complaining . 
  at least all of my history classes called it sveaborg , and [ britannica ] ( http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/575967/sveaborg ) seems to agree . 
  also in a historical sense , the translation is indeed [ sveaborg ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_sveaborg ) , but i guess people do n't care anymore and call it by the finnish name . 
  suomenlinna has an actual english translation : sveaborg \\* * insert shock **, 
  that looks a lot like a typical northwestern upper middle class suburb in the states . 
  wow . 
  looks a bit like kallio . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( please ^ ^ ^ forgive ^ ^ ^ me . ), 
   hesalaiset the who ? 
  never heard of that ... ? 
  soon , it will be renamed kannibalgrad . 
  i do n't even like alcohol , but i 'd drink the fuck out of that . 
  turku has an airport ? 
  just do n't ask locals how to get to the design district . 
  we have no idea . 
  the city came up with the idea a few years ago with tourism in mind , and we do n't actually use that term ourselves . 
  i 've only heard bastukvast , but i guess you learn something new every day . 
  i find it disturbing how talented ove sundberg can be sometimes . 
  dat accent tho . 
  try the ruishampurilainen . 
  it 's got rye bread and shit . 
  if you drink , `` kallion kierros '' ( tour de kallio ) is a uniquely helsinkian activity where one enjoys a beverage at each of kallio 's numerous bars in one evening and tries to make it out alive . 
  if you do n't mind a pint , that 's supposed to be fun , i 've been told . 
  the word is vihta or vasta ( depending on your dialect ) in finnish , in case you have no idea what to google . 
  i 'm not moldovan , but i believe they do want to retain territorial integrity . 
  if they let transnistria split , it would give other separatist regions , mostly gagauzia , the signal that you can achieve something by turning rebellious . 
  would n't matter . 
  they 're bust already . 
  gosh , my sides . 
  i really hope that 's real . 
  compare that to finnish : h\u00e4\u00e4y\u00f6aie . 
  ( y is a vowel , by the way , similar to the german \u00fc . ), 
  good old remove kebab propaganda music . 
  ca n't hate this . 
   it 's not like they 're out of touch with what 's going on there . 
  trust me , they are . 
  '' ` teknik ! ', 
  exclaimed the russian when he saw a door hinge . '', 
  except , you know , the usual drunken knife fight jokes . 
  i hope this is sarcasm . 
  be the moral example instead of resorting to the whataboutist fallacy russia and israel have have been guilty of this year . 
  this . 
  if you 're sitting next to a stranger and there 's an empty row ahead of you , run for your life !, 
  except the eu will start gearing more and more towards norwegian oil and gas until satisfactory energy independence is established . 
  we buy with hard cash , and when russia ( which is a major producer ) is more or less completely cubanized by the west , which does n't seem like a pipe-dream any longer , oil and gas prices are guaranteed to go up . 
  conveniently , for you guys , you are geographically close and have a political climate that is the most compatible out of other producers . 
  `` taste our apples . 
  they 're so good they were banned in russia . '', 
  hmm , to vote for free money or not to vote for free money ... that is the question . 
  finland can not into relevance . 
  not a very attra *** xxchk *** tive diale *** xxchk *** t , is it ? 
  we can get rid of * rikssvenska * but do n't you dare to touch our dialects . 
  can someone tell me why it 's in latin letters instead of cyrillics ? 
  i thought you could pick and choose in bosnia but not in serbia or croatia . 
  wow , that took a quick turn from ironic to really dark . 
  loved how all the jokerit fans started booing when it was sung at the talviklassikko last winter . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  no longer exists , does n't matter . 
  i think you may have missed / u/aschebescher 's . 
  while i agree that we were finlandized , i 'd save the thumb expression for the eastern bloc . 
  also , the place that you guys bombed now belongs to russia , so who cares . 
  saying that the uk is detached from europe sounds like a load of bull [ in finland ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw-v2/images/europe.gif ) , especially because you guys have the tunnel and everything . 
  like that . 
  this is the first one that really made my blood boil out of anger and appallment . 
  enjoy your upvote . 
  this . 
  fuck those guys , but they 're the closest thing we have to a family , and you can always count on your brothers . 
  can confirm . 
  a lot of the swedes i 've met have been a little douchey ( not all , of course ) even though finland can into v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd just as much . 
  confirmed . 
   it 's just a homage to your superior cheese , ~ ~ jeez ~ ~ * cheese * . 
  ftfy, 
  croatia  italy there , i said it . 
  lower population density ? 
  lmao , finland says hi . 
  imagine that a place like that exists a stone 's throw away from finland . 
  i know you 're not supposed to say `` came here to say this '' but i came here to say this . 
  10/10 , would look at her again . 
  if we even got our current projects built , that 'd be great ... 
  or c ) the eu becomes a military alliance , which is the option i would root for . 
  a tight-knit alliance with sweden would be a good place to start . 
  do n't say that . 
  just do n't . 
  no idea . 
  just ban him to be on the safe side . 
  finland coupled with sweden could be a pretty effective combination . 
  finland 's got the troops and sweden 's got the tech . 
  this is why nordic military cooperation is vital . 
  our militaries are worthless separately . 
  eh , not sure if sarcastic . 
  even though finlandization is n't as strong as it was some decades ago , it 's still there . 
  a lot of it , if not all , is nowadays related to economics , because they 're a major trading partner of ours and we export a lot of products there . 
  more like `` i had the capability to have sexual relations with her , too bad she could n't assure the safety of her genitalia . '', 
  in finland , we have a saying : `` stupidity condenses in groups . '', 
  grounding jets is fun . 
  ^ ( too soon ? ), 
  probably not , but we even beat you in the swedish language . 
  our [ most swedish-speaking municipality ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hammarland ) is more swedish-speaking than yours !, 
  ha , take that !,
