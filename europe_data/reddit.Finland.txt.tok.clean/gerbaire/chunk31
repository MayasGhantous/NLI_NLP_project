  get money out of politics . 
  huh . 
  ca n't say i understood the whole dynamic but i guess that 's a thing . 
  thanks !, 
  i had n't even heard of sturgeon before the referendum but she 's turned out to be quite a tough lassie . 
  good on her !, 
  please shed some light onto this , thou enlightened . 
  i 'm thirsty for knowledge . 
  measly britain 2018 , calling it already . 
  well , he ca n't send his german wife home , now can he ? 
  the bank of england just pledged to spend # 250 billion , 27 years of eu membership worth , on helping out the now collapsing financial sector , though . 
  what were the well-informed arguments ? 
  no s\u00e4rskrivning , you danskj\u00e4vel . 
  you seriously have no clue what the phrase `` ethnic russian '' means and you are confusing it with `` russian national . '', 
  you 're the one who should be looking this up . 
  chechens are most definitely not ethnically russian . 
  they 're ethnically chechen but their nationality is russian . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians please read that very carefully . 
  especially the disambiguation in the beginning . 
  you need to come from a long line of russian-speaking east slavs to count as ethnically russian . 
  it 's not ambiguous at all . 
  you are telling me to take my flag off when i 'm merely pointing out the fact that russia is a hateful society . 
  what 's in it for you to get so riled up about it , spewing non-sense about chechens being ethnic russians and calling me bigoted for pointing out that somebody else is just that and showing historical evidence to prove the point ? 
  who are you loyal to ? 
  you really are pushing this `` the west is so russophobic '' angle like a putin bot . 
   right . 
  other undeniable facts are that sun rises from the west , you are a very tolerant person and finland is still a grand duchy of russian empire . 
  you 're saying russia is tolerant ? 
  what the fuck . 
   they 'd have a huge civil war across the entire state this has happened . 
   ethnic russian '' as a concept includes countless sub-ethnicities on its own no , it does n't . 
  as i said , only ethnic russians are ethnic russians . 
  not all russians citizens are ethnic russians . 
  you should seriously go to bed now . 
  not all russian citizens are ethnic russians . 
  that 's why i specified the chechens as a separate identity . 
  there is vicious hatred towards non-ethnic russian among ethnic russians . 
  that 's an undeniable fact . 
  africans would merely be another minority to hate on . 
   traditionally , russian racism included antisemitism , as well as hostility towards various ethnicities of caucasus and central asia . 
  [ 1 ] the director of the moscow bureau for human rights , alexander brod , stated that surveys show xenophobia and other racist expressions are prevalent in 50 percent of russians . 
  [ 2 ] in 2006 , amnesty international reported that racism in russia was `` out of control '' and estimated the number of russian neo-nazis at around 85,000 in 2008 . 
  just read these . 
  there are several cases of people getting beat up or killed because of their ethnicity . 
  you mentioned the tajiks . 
  well , here 's an article of a highly publicized case of tajiks getting beaten the shit out of them as part of a hate crime just last month . 
  i know several people who have lived in russia as foreigners , and they all tell the same story . 
  russia is a very hateful country against minorities , let that be ethnic , sexual , or other . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism_in_russia http://www.eurasianet.org/node/78686, 
  let me reiterate a very important part of a previous comment of mine :  of course there are a handful of black people in russia . 
  north korea must be the only country that does n't have a single one . 
  what i 'm talking about is there being enough of them for them to be a sizable minority . 
  do you know what sizable means ? 
  america would n't have problems with race relations if the diversity of their population was negligible . 
  maybe it 's just time for you to go to bed already . 
  so you 're * really * suggesting a black minority would be embraced by the russian society ? 
  allow me to laugh . 
  just look how much solidarity they 're giving the refugees . 
  i mean , fuck , they 're dropping cluster bombs on these people back in syria as we speak . 
   i rest my case on `` man so stuck in propagandist message , he 's straight up willing to take his self-victimization and just shove it in face of anyone who dares to point out how he 's self-victimized , because those subhuman westerners are so fascist '' . 
  of course there are a handful of black people in russia . 
  north korea must be the only country that does n't have a single one . 
  what i 'm talking about is there being enough of them for them to be a sizable minority . 
  all you need to know about minorities in russia is [ the deportations of crimean tatars ( the problems seems to have started again , by the way ) and balts , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/gulag_location_map.svg/2000px-gulag_location_map.svg.png ) and [ the wars in the caucasus . 
  ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000hspys3a9ve0/s/900/russia-chechnya-war-eru102563.jpg ) an african minority would have been absolutely fucked over there . 
  now , go back to sippin ' that rt russophobia juice . 
  the true irony in this one is that the russians would lynch the blacks doubly as hard if they just had any . 
  hell , they 'd probably even go to war against them like they did against the chechens . 
  you are de * jure * not part of the eu . 
  you are de facto , though . 
  i see it as an educational issue . 
  people who do n't know any better are buying into brexit bs . 
  what do the islanders sound like ? 
  do you understand italian and spanish through romanian or have you studied them ? 
  i understand them too but because i 've studied both plus french . 
  but romanian is always total gibberish to me . 
  not all finns . 
  just [ jonnes .

  do you want to leave the un as well ? 
  i was too young in 1997 to know anything about christensen . 
  holy fuck . 
  and a finnish chick married him and had a kid with him three years later . 
  everything is just so insane about it . 
  what is more free than having twenty bodyguards for each mp ... 
  none , but they certainly should for this level of finlandization . 
  yes , but russia is pouring absolutely insane amounts of money into drills they certainly ca n't afford . 
  frankly , yes . 
  income inequality is a massive problem in the whole of the us . 
  a lot of this is due to the fact that this is per capita , not the median . 
  just because someone is filthy rich and brings up the average , does n't mean everyone else is not poor . 
  do you not want kim , putin , and whoever the fuck leads isis dead ? 
  i know i do . 
  yes , that is true . 
  but i 'm sure there are a lot republicans who would n't be too pleased to have a new wedge driven between the two irelands . 
  if you speak out against the eu , you speak out against people like me . 
  extremely simple , just like geert . 
  ooh , nice of you to tell me this .
