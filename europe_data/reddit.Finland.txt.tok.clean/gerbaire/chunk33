  2 ) i realized who you are and that i 've had an online argument with you before . 
  if your ' e adamant enough to debate about personal taste and semantics without agreeing to disagree , debating quantifiable matters and facts is going to be just as fruitful . 
  we still need to put an end to the last bastion of finlandization , which is our defense policy . 
  we ca n't risk our independence by remaining unaligned . 
  a dictator who sold our democracy for his own benefit with the notes from the soviets that he ordered . 
  horrible piece of shit if you ask me . 
  the first clip is probably the first time i 've ever seen an explicit shot of real weed in a music video . 
  i would n't be surprised if the blunt was n't fake either . 
  he really does n't look sober smoking it . 
  this guy seriously does n't give a fuck . 
   eu 's common fishery and agricultural policy is not part of the eea agreement . 
  according to the eea agreement article 19 , norway and the eu are nonetheless committed to gradually liberalize their trade in agricultural products . 
  bilateral tariff quotas and tariff-free quotas are established between norway and the eu for certain agricultural products such as cheese , meats , fruit , vegetables and flowers , among others . 
  there are massive exceptions within the eea framework . 
  de facto , norway does n't have import tariffs from the eu . 
  the change would be negligible . 
  http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/norway/eu_norway/trade_relation/index_en.htm  you should have searched about this before you wrote that . 
  this is basically my university major . 
  you 're already part of the common market ( eea ) . 
  this would n't change . 
   oh , and goldmember quotes and references on reddit . 
  ugh ... vell , then there ` sh no pleashing you . 
  when i 'm speaking about bohemians , i 'm talking about artsy people from counterculture scenes with leftist communal leanings and generally not a ton of money . 
  [ example pic .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gentrification ) this is what 's going on in areas surrounding vallila . 
  r\u00f6\u00f6peri is way past this . 
  r\u00f6\u00f6peri has already moved on to what i call [ hipsters ] ( http://www.lily.fi/sites/lily/files/user/11439/2013/09/kuva_7.png ) . 
  these are young trendy urbanites from wealthy families who live a very millennial life with the newest gadgets and buzzwords . 
  in fact , r\u00f6\u00f6peri has started becoming so expensive that these people are getting pushed and are finding their way to taka-t\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 and kallio . 
  this causes a chain reaction where the bohemians are getting replaced by hipsters , leaving behind even wealthier neighborhoods and pushing the bohemians farther away from downtown . 
  the hipsters have n't made their way here yet , but kallio is already in the process of getting taken over . 
  well , define high demand and high prices . 
  two very different things when comparing helsinki to the rest of finland . 
  i grew up around here so i know the families that live in these parts . 
  they 're upper middle class areas ( at least on the helsinki scale of things ) , and the houses are usually bought with a shit ton of debt . 
  but the wave of uber wealthy residents that traditionally went for penthouses in the south or villas in grani are jacking up the prices towards the 1 million and over category . 
  the only thing that 's somewhat relieving the pressure is new development in kalasatama . 
  it 's not anecdotal . 
  here you can see that the area is definitely seeing the most growth in the whole country . 
  the gentrification process is * far * from over . 
  no , it 's been bohemian . 
  r\u00f6\u00f6peri has been hipster for years . 
  only recently have the hipsters started flocking north after eira started leaking over to r\u00f6\u00f6peri , making it too expensive even for hipsters . 
  the summer is already over . 
  we had 10 good days starting on may 1st . 
  i got a pretty bad sunburn in early may . 
  wtf . 
  yeah , these are my hoods . 
  it 's not very touristy but the area between the train tracks and vanhankaupunginlahti/gammelstadsfj \u00e4rden makes for some pretty comfortable and aesthetic living . 
  too bad the entire city has realized this and it 's rapidly gentrifying . 
  check back in 10 years . 
  that title is held by r\u00f6\u00f6peri ( punavuori/r \u00f6dbergen ) at the moment . 
  this . 
  it 's for cleansing and relaxation , not reproduction . 
   are those people even ( legally ) recognized as female ? 
   i sort of doubt it . 
  as we can see on the map , depends what country . 
  i do n't know about ftm but in mtf cases , as long as there is healthy sperm , what hormone levels the biological father / legal mother has is probably quite irrelevant , since all you 're doing is transplanting dna and none of the hormones . 
  why there has to be legal genders is something i do n't get . 
  i do n't see a function for them . 
  i wish we had n't explicitly legalized gay marriage but rather just deleted the words `` man '' and `` woman '' from all legislation and replaced them with `` human . '', 
  this issue with sterilization when it comes to legal gender changes would have been solved with it . 
  this . 
  in my family , the traditional gender roles were definitely switched . 
  my dad was the care-taker who cooked food and spent more time with me whereas my mom concentrated more on her career . 
  who 's your mom and dad , what genders they have , and what roles they play are completely irrelevant in my opinion , as long as all of the kid 's needs are met .

  as if limburg was to be missed . 
  looks real , judging by the seam on the dashboard . 
  probably built for driving school . 
  it feels pretty accurate to me . 
  i enjoy cooking a lot . 
  it had n't even occurred to me how much tall people struggle with kitchen counters . 
  they 're * just * the right height for me . 
  wow . 
  dutch banter . 
  that 's really * low * . 
  can you speak up ? 
  i 'm at sea level . 
  ca n't hear you from up here !, 
  it was actually because of the ambiguous wording of the referendum . 
  when lukashenko came into power , he proposed returning to the soviet symbols because he 's cccp as fuck . 
  the referendum asked : `` do you support the suggestion about the introduction of the new state flag and state coat of arms of the republic of belarus ? '', 
  it was up to lukashenko 's interpretation which one was the `` new '' flag , the white-red-white flag that had been reinstated four years prior or the revamped soviet flag . 
  it 's understandable . 
  you guys have to stay above water if it starts flooding . 
  our country rises out of the sea by itself . 
  yeah , oregon 's pretty chill , too . 
  just brotherly dumping on the pnw bff . 
   what 's wrong with oregonians ? 
  me having lived in wa . 
  =d but what unites us two is our common hate for cali . 
  alaska is chill . 
  oregonians suck , though . 
  let 's ban alabamians too ; it 's a poor state so they might overstay . 
  there 's absolutely nothing we could gain from joining nato except protection from russia . 
  it would , actually , otherwise be a very disadvantageous deal . 
  no pro-nato figure has ever raised any other point .
