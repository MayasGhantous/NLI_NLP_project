  that and an even playing field . 
  there 's 4-5 parties just a few percent away from one another . 
  but not switzerland , norway , and iceland expensive . 
  finland has got to be the fourth most expensive country in europe but those three are really in a league of their own . 
  i feel like vvd needs gl and cda more than they need vvd . 
  i suspect rutte has a lot of concessions to make in order to form a majority . 
  gl could remain outside of it and be a very strong opposition party who could landslide in 2021 , and that would be a nightmare for vvd . 
  dutch folks really like their houses .

  never had that happen to me in the uk either but small talk is rampant in north america .

  rutte and wilders just had a quick debate a few hours ago , something wilders never does . 
  and for a good reason because he did very badly . 
  there 's one last debate tomorrow with all of the major parties , including wilders , so we 'll see what happens . 
  wilders has been sliding down in the polls quite hard for the past two weeks , and i do n't think there 's much he could do to redeem that . 
  not that actual governance is something wilders would seem to be very interested in ...

  still better than what ever the fuck the current government does . 
  i love how erdogan is calling the dutch nazis and fascists when the person calling these shots is the mayor of rotterdam , ahmed aboutaleb . 
  i think it 's got to do with the methodology . 
  nl is situated perfectly for a weekendje almost anywhere in europe but they only count trips longer than four nights .

  yeah , dutch people are pretty open-minded about it but would never even think to try it themselves .

  other than getting closure and finding out the truth about the most legendary finnish politician , you 're right , it would n't really make a difference . 
   the fact that he was perceived as practically the only person who could walk the tightrope between soviet pressure and finnish interests . 
  this is where i have a stark difference of opinion with people who seriously think this way . 
  there is a real possibility that the pressure you mentioned was fabricated by kekkonen himself in collusion with the soviets or that the soviets were attempting to dictate who our president should be . 
  i think finland , as a sovereign state , should n't have given into outside pressure if these allegations really are true , and it should have aligned itself with the west and joined nato in order to protect itself , even if that would have escalated the tensions . 
  but there 's a chance we 'll never know for sure if there was collusion . 
  here 's a bunch of readings for you . 
  ctrl-f for collusion : https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v16/d241 https://books.google.nl/books?id=hf-e7dtr_xyc&amp;pg=pa249&amp;lpg=pa249&amp;dq=kekkonen+collusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g_ucg2srl5&amp;sig=f1j5lwvb6cjjp6p61po9cr127vw&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj9zi2ds8tsahxfmbokhudiaauq6aeigzaa#v=onepage&amp;q=kekkonen%20collusion&amp;f=false https://books.google.nl/books?id=5f_vcgaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa279&amp;lpg=pa279&amp;dq=kekkonen+collusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hibwh97skq&amp;sig=0-epsau9palozwlodlsankrcp_e&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj9zi2ds8tsahxfmbokhudiaauq6aeiidab#v=onepage&amp;q=kekkonen%20collusion&amp;f=false the theory is that 1 ) either the soviets offered a deal or simply informed the kekkonen campaigns that they would send angry notes that would scare away potential competitors in support of overtly friendly relations and continuity or , 2 ) more incriminatingly , kekkonen requested that the soviets send notes in order to stay in power in exchange for favors that he would carry out for them . 
  the reason these theories are mostly probable conspiracies and are n't investigated to the extent they should be is because kekkonen 's hijack of democracy stopped being a taboo very recently and because young people are n't very interested at all . 
  can you change crimea to reflect the de jure situation ? 
  hard for me to comment in retrospect because i was n't alive , let alone politically aware , back then but my impression of why he did n't have greater opposition was because finlandization was and still is big in the baby boomer generation . 
  in my eyes , selling complete finnish sovereignty ( as in giving into soviet demands voluntarily ) for personal gain is a grave offense and should under no circumstances be tolerated . 
  again , thanks for the instant downvote , stuijfsande . 
  you might want to refer to reddiquette to study what the button is there for . 
  this is not the first time i have had to raise this with you in the past week . 
  what comes to actual content , both the swiss franc and the south african rand are more unstable than the euro and have historical reasons as to why they are reserve currencies . 
  the previous guilder never was , and the new one , should there ever be one , will not be either . 
  citation to your claim ? 
  yes , the dutch economy is heavily reliant on trade but it is only number 8 in terms of exports . 
  the vast majority of these exports is to eu countries and the euro is a key tool in that . 
  furthermore , the guilder would never take the role of a reserve currency . 
  it would be used by 17 million dutch people and by them only . 
  so yes , that is a relatively small currency . 
  the smaller the currency , the more volatile it is . 
  you ca n't deny the fact that fascism has created quite dapper flags , heraldry , uniforms , etc. 
  the only thing the communists were good at were anthems . 
  the soviet union did request that he be reelected . 
  it is probable that he colluded with the soviets by promising to stay friendly if they scared finland into having him reelected repeatedly . 
  from wikipedia : `` some of kekkonen 's actions remain controversial in modern finland , and disputes continue about how to interpret many of his policies and actions . 
  he often used what was termed the `` moscow card '' when his authority was threatened . '', 
  dude was as close to being a dictator as finland with all that it stands for would allow . 
  not my favorite politician to say the least . 
  does that take into account the costs of maintaining a small currency and the fact that the euro facilitates trade ? 
  yes , swedish uses y instead of \u00dc , which is where finnish got its y from . 
  i do get your comment and agree with it somewhat but groenlinks has a lot of potential to steal voters from sp , d66 , and pvda , and who knows , they might lure young people to the polls . 
  they have a charismatic , young leader and just the right amount of populism , and the explosion in their support signals to me that they have n't reached maximum saturation just yet .
