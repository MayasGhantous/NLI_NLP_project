  wew 9 euro payment because my plan covers a bit more . 
  that 's only for low income people . 
  also premiums are too high . 
   tuition is n't that expensive around her . 
  i know because i 'm low income and i can afford it . 
  you 're probably taking a loan in order to afford it . 
  in my opinion , the state should invest in its youth and its future . 
  education should be a right , not a privilege . 
  there is no valid reason to discourage learning . 
  thanks , will be watching that . 
  - lower minimum wages for teens and young adults which the companies love to exploit the fuck out of . 
  do you not want your youngsters working ? 
  - having to pay for healthcare . 
  no other european country that i can think of does this . 
  not even neo-thacherist britain . 
  - having to pay tuition and getting absolutely no support from the government except cheap loans . 
  do you not want your youngsters educated ? 
  i have heard the argument that dutchmen spend too much time getting degrees they might not end up needing , but in my opinion , when pvv is leading the polls , cutting from education is the last thing you want to do . 
  - dutch students get free train travel but students from eu countries do n't . 
  we contribute to the dutch economy more than the locals but a yellow ns card is still unattainable . 
  we would like to travel the country but when a roundtrip within randstad costs 20-30 euros , you can forget about it . 
  let 's be real though . 
  not even the worst case scenario has france leaving . 
  le pen ca n't do that alone even if she somehow magically manages to win . 
  gl pleases the nordic welfare state fanatic in me but it 's slightly naive as a party , or that 's how it comes across to me , with stuff like nuclear power . 
  klaver is very level-headed and fresh , though . 
  d66 is very realist and respectable but slightly too far right on the economic spectrum for me . 
  i 'm 60-40 or 55-45 split between the two , in favor of gl , but i would personally vote for gl in order to push the equilibrium farther left , away from pvv and vvd . 
  moved here in august . 
  it 's great . 
  there are some little things i liked better in finland but all in all things are good . 
  and yes , i 've been to schilderswijk . 
  a bunch of times , actually . 
  and no , it 's not bad at all . 
  4.5 / 5 , would stay . 
  man , if only d66 and gl teamed up . 
  they 'd be the biggest party and it would be great to have true progressives leading a country for once . 
  when are the next debates , by the way ? 
  getting away with shooting a trespasser to death because of the castle doctrine but having to rot in jail for a doobie sounds pretty archaic to me . 
  it 's still untrue in the sense that he called sweden a nice place . 
  i appreciate the username . 
  could be the finn in me speaking but making up an excuse just to party with your extended family and relatives sounds like a terrible idea . 
  why are you not speaking belgian ? 
  1323 was when the first official border between sweden and russia was established . 
  finland had been part of sweden for a lot longer . 
  - rotterdam harbor should be where the letter c in delft city hall is - delft is more important than its city hall - a4 between vlaardingen and amsterdam is missing completely even though it 's probably the most important highway as it connects the 3 biggest cities in the country - leiden , schiphol airport , and amsterdam should form a straight line map of finland : - inari is severely dislocated - hanko and espoo are too far west - vuosaari harbor is to the east of helsinki , not southwest - siilinj\u00e4rvi is spelled with an \u00e4 map of sweden : - hemavan is spelled with an e and it 's farther west, 
  til spies spy . 
  i would n't put it past them to hire susceptible people from other countries in order to hide their tracks . 
  people do pretty much anything for money . 
  i do n't think where you live should affect how much your vote is worth . 
  yes , because that 's insane . 
  america would be better off but still . 
  the loser wins ? 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  what do you mean when ? 
  le pen is never going to win the second round . 
  france is n't england where the sun and the mail have been fabricating lies about the eu for profit for decades . 
  third largest as soon as the results were announced . 
  that 's all that needs to be said , really . 
  simply not true . 
   we should be in charge of our own sovereignty did it work out that way ? 
  previously , you got to sit at the table and make continent-wide decisions with everyone else , as equals . 
  now the future of your nation 's whole economy relies on the whims of foreign leaders and what trade deals each of them decides to give , if any at all like in the case of the eu . 
  we do too . 
  and these are more important than human suffering because ... ? 
  the day your prime minister , who is an unelected official , came to talk to our elected officials in brussels and finally realized that she never had any bargaining chips , let alone an upper hand , was when i started believing in europe again . 
  but you ca n't count black people and alabamians raping their cousins and so on and so forth !, 
  that 's apples to oranges . 
  europe is sooo homogeneous except it 's not because mooslems !, 
  a democracy where the candidate with the less votes becomes the president . 
  if only d66 and gl were one party ... 
  it 's such a pretty and unique combination in my opinion . 
  shame that its symbolism has been tarnished by extreme political ideologies . 
   it 's easier to criticize others than it is to criticize yourself and then work on fixing your own problems . 
  and you go on to doing just that in the very next sentence . 
  5/7 logic . 
  let alone the fact that america 's crime and murder rates are infinitely larger than those of europe . 
  pvv is going downhill in the netherlands too . 
  who 's justifying violence against trump supporters ? 
  i can only see trump supporters claiming that all the while dehumanizing and threatening others . 
  * in the aaaaarms ooooof an angel ... *, 
  i upvoted you , do n't worry . 
  it 's not your fault that you 're barely above mississippi . 
  i 'm a liberal and i genuinely found that hilarious , thank for that . 
  i really hope we can get more anti-liberal humour of this standard ( most of it was funny at first but now it 's mostly just low quality shitposting from accounts that just happen to get 12 posts on / r/all from different subs at the same time . ), 
  it works the same the other way . 
  alt-right tears . 
  you could say that but then again you can say the same for english as the systems are near-identical . 
  english just happens to prefer the `` of the '' structure in most non-human cases .

   in heidelberg the attacker , described by police as a 35-year-old german `` without a migration background '', 
  i live in the netherlands and what sets rotterdam apart the most is the architecture . 
  never really paid much attention to people 's ethnicity there . 
  everyone speaks fluent dutch regardless , it 's quite amazing . 
  carl bildt 's official first name is nils . 
  i really do n't think this is a coincidence .
