  exactly . 
  common sense loses . 
  are n't regular shrooms really easy to get ahold of on the black market , just like pretty much any drug here in the netherlands ? 
  knowing rutte , common sense will lose in this case . 
  brutalist architecture * can * become iconic . 
  at least that 's what happened to fernsehturm in berlin , and it can happen to merihaka in helsinki once the prices rise . 
  basically yes . 
  i do n't know , at least to me , especially what adjectives mean is really duidelijk/tydlig ( t ) and the similarities in other words are pretty overweldigend / \u00f6verv\u00e4ldigande . 
  there are so many similarities . 
  vocabulary , grammar like the largely two-gender systems , etc. 
  speaking swedish really helps me with dutch , living here in the netherlands . 
  i think dutch should be up closer to the scandinavian languages with a line to danish instead of hanging below german and english . 
  janne said a few lines in finnish . 
  here 's a few more clips : i have no idea why this has 10 times more views than native speakers of finland swedish but , uh , enjoy i guess . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjxv1bzfdig here 's a more normal video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of-j11kdhew, 
  it 's hippa in finnish . 
  i 've heard both hippa and tafatt in finland swedish . 
  the glottal stops work just like the swedish tone system . 
  it 's insanely cool when you learn it . 
  we who speak swedish register them as pauses at first but they 're actually * binding * words together . 
  what about finland swedish ? 
  sweden actually has a significantly lower population density . 
  this is the answer . 
  and france has nukes . 
  if nato ceased to exist , a common eu army would n't probably take long to set up . 
  it would be a huge wake-up call . 
  the eu has over 500 million people . 
  for the homeless people i always see when i travel to america , not so much . 
  when you come to europe , pop by here in holland . 
  do n't just go to london or paris . 
  they 're terribly unrepresentative of the rest of the continent . 
  and frankly overrated . 
  what i like about holland is that it offers all the best parts of being in europe with no weird cultural quirks or language barriers . 
  implying there is a middle class in the us . 
  yeah , it 's really compact with very little wasted space . 
  you managed at your task . 
  people are n't that mobile . 
  most people ca n't simply decide to leave a country the instant they notice immigration . 
  it requires planning . 
  we were talking about wars started by the us vs wars started by russia since 2003 . 
  slovenia chose to take part in the ongoing conflicts by joining nato after they had started so they really have no right to hold a grudge against the alliance . 
  libya was started by france and the uk , afghanistan never ended and it 's continuation of the same conflict , iraq did n't take place after 2003 ... read some books , fella . 
  2013 was also when snowden started leaking nsa documents . 
  georgia , crimea , and donbass come to mind . 
  looks like belarus is next . 
  yeah , started by russia . 
  none by america . 
  you guys joined nato in 2004 . 
  iraq started in 2003 . 
  66 % of the vote was for joining . 
  choosing to join but still preferring your enemy over your actual allies is plainly mind-boggling . 
  so they affect you because you chose them to affect you and now you guys are butthurt about your own decision . 
  wow . 
  and iraq and afghanistan did ? 
  found the flevolander . 
  h\u00e4\u00e4y\u00f6aie . 
  if single parents are ok , i really do n't see why gay couples could n't be . 
  the more the merrier .

  the third most upvoted post in the past month , with 18.1 k karma and 77 % upvotes , is critique of trudeau . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5ruzql/justin_trudeau_on_making_promises/ it 's not just a handful . 
  all of the comments are critical and many loyal liberal voters are threatening to vote for someone else next time around . 
  so it 's not just `` a few redditors . '', 
  it 's a phenomenon . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm sure canadians would pick trudeau over harper any day but legal weed seems to be the only major promise `` joe '' trudeau is willing to deliver . 
  it would be understandable if they did n't control a majority of the seats in the house of commons but they do . 
  and the senate is very easily swayed thanks to the great number of independents . 
  they do ? 
  i disagree . 
  as if anyone did n't think that already . 
  nope . 
  ukrainian is the sole official language of ukraine . 
  however , crimea is an autonomous republic within ukraine able to enact its own statutes . 
  taiwan is a bit different . 
  the people 's republic and taiwan are alternate universes of the same china . 
  in my eyes , prc and taiwan are like north korea vs south korea and west vs east germany , the same country but two different governments . 
  i think more countries should recognize taiwan instead of the people 's republic but they do n't choose to do so because of economics . 
  nope . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea russia and only 8 other states recognize crimea as part of russia . 
  it 's language ? 
  you mean crimean tatar ? 
  it was alive and well . 
  now their tv and other media has been banned . 
  just wait until russia deports them again like they did the last time they held on to the territory . 
  oppressed how ? 
  if someone 's been oppressing the rightful owners of crimea , it 's russia giving hell to the tatars . 
  de jure yes , de facto no . 
  and the next best thing , d66 . 
  yes , cannabis abuse ( emphasis on abuse ) can hasten the development of schizophrenia if you have the gene . 
  schizophrenia is a genetic disorder , and cannabis does n't change the genes in your brain . 
  if you do not have the schizo gene , you are physically unable to develop it ; if you do have the gene , you are probably going to develop it no matter what . 
  if you have people suffering from schizophrenia in your family , weed is n't for you , but it does n't affect those who do n't . 
  weed is as bad as not flossing .

  bruns\u00e5s or better yet gr\u00e4dds\u00e5s for fuck 's sake . 
  iirc , the eu is no military alliance . 
  all members are obligated to aid a member under attack but the key word `` militarily '' is unfortunately missing . 
  they should also add `` full mobilization '' so that some indifferent country does n't send three tanks and call it a day .
