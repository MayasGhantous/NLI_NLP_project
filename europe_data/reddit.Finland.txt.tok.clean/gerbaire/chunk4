  yup , same here . 
  wow , denmark and finland own per capita . 
  ca n't europeans go to afghanistan with the us army and gain us citizenship that way ? 
  or am i completely mistaken ? 
  estonia 's got one station per ~ 8000 citizens , and finland 's got one per every ~ 57500 people . 
  what 's shocking is that we drink way more than the danes . 
  and half of estonia 's beer is drunk by finnish tourists . 
  tough shit . 
  they gave up their right to be listened to ages ago . 
  ukraine should take the slavic towns and romania the romanian towns . 
  [ yoinks , now they can . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/cptgcyp ) this is why putin needs to be stopped . 
   ultimately disintegrates . 
  this would be the dream . 
  we call dibs on puppeting st. petersburg . 
  rt blocked all comments in the flight article , stating that :  `` for technical reasons , the comments feature has been temporarily disabled .

  the top comments left in view seem to support russia .

  nazi-zionism for everybody !, 
  considering what a melting pot you guys are , you might need an entire page for that . 
  [ been there , done that . 
   drug dealer released because he was arrested and read his rights in dutch instead of french yup . 
  that 's belgium for ya . 
   oleg sentsov `` acquired '' russian citizenship without his consent and against his will wow , this sent chills down my spine . 
  pardon my soviet russia joke , but it has to be done : * in america , you acquire citizenship . 
  in soviet russia , citizenship acquire you !, 
  i believe [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) is what they 're refering to , a similar incident in nazi germany . 
  gleiwitz is apparently glivitse in russian . 
  social liberalism ? 
  i know he likes to advertise himself as a social liberal , but supporting gay marriage hardly counts as liberalism anymore . 
  the guy 's all for the war on drugs . 
  yup . 
  went to copenhagen last summer , and the 7-11 i went to a few times was 2/3 alcohol . 
  what is this liberal blasphemy ? 
  human rights supporter here . 
  these people have called those lands home for a longer time than what white people have settled the americas . 
  saying that you ca n't be both a european and a muslim is like saying you ca n't be post-colonial and american at the same time . 
  change `` russian '' to `` german '' and who do you get ? 
  the irony is so obvious it 's making me upset . 
  i 'm slowly beginning to think malm\u00f6 is sweden 's florida when it comes to news articles . 
  1 ) you can understand the chorus if you speak finnish 2 ) it 's a nice blend of stereotypically estonian and cringe-worthy . 
  it 's kind of like rebecca black 's friday . 
  but estonian . 
  you got ta know some people like i do , unfortunately . 
  i have a very entry-level job ( now that i 'm not studying in the summer ) which includes picking up trash from the street and such not-so-nice gigs . 
  i make 10.50 $ / h or over 4000 $ in 10.5 weeks . 
  neuschwanstein ( princess castle ) in the south of bavaria or innsbruck ( skiing in the summer ) in tyrol , maybe ? 
  good luck with trying to kill yourself with pot . 
  it 's about tax income . 
  said by a turk . 
  the irony ... 
  liverpool says hi . 
  and vomits in your mouth . 
  oh , it 's way past the `` dutch opinion '' in wa and co. 
  they take legalization and taxation for granted whereas you folks still have it technically illegal but tolerated . 
  just saying . 
  [ joo ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/map_swedish_lands.png ) =(, 
  i have no idea ... 
  there 's no way i could translate that without google . 
  does hringur mean `` ring ? '', 
  finlandssvenska can into icelandic . 
  and people say learning swedish is useless . 
  bitch , i 'm translating icelandic !, 
  management by perkele vs `` ska vi diskutera ? '', 
  they never could have . 
  they had planned to rob a gun store for weapons and extract explosive gas from the bedrock . 
  in other words , they were batshit cray cray . 
  you might want to think twice before you ask for whatever they were having . 
  merci . 
  i feel bad for laughing . 
  any pictures ? 
  want to play this year 's hit game ? 
  come to belgium ; we 've got you covered !, 
  ^ ( `` kill the wallonian '' ^ ^ tm . 
  sponsored by the region of flanders . ), 
  it 's been my impression that finland has practically zero gun violence . 
  every time the police has to fire a gun , it 's all over the papers . 
  but yes , alcohol helps people release their aggression , so an overwhelming majority of the little crime we have is alcohol-related . 
  also domestic or between friends . 
  as long as you steer away from overly intoxicated people ( which is a good tip for all countries all over the world ) , finland is an incredibly safe country . 
  also , eastern and northern finland are practically empty wastelands compared to the south , west , and southwest . 
  the legal committee refused to accept it on the agenda , and ( if i 've understood correctly ) it is the body responsible for turning it from a mere draft into a full-fledged law proposition . 
  it will still be voted on by the parliament , but in its current state , thus many will likely vote against it , as the quality is undoubtedly subpar . 
  i 'm hoping the majority will vote for and amend it later instead of just rejecting it altogether . 
  in finland , [ 65 % of the country is for and 8 % is on the fence ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/survey_finds_rising_support_for_gay_marriage/7135771 ) about gay marriage . 
  there is no denying that finland is progressive . 
  in no way does today 's vote represent the people of finland , and democracy had nothing to do with it . 
  it was quite counter-democratic rather , considering that 10 people single-handedly turned down something 166 000 people had signed . 
  same applies to finland . 
  be very afraid . 
  also , why are we assuming that they are of opposing genders ? 
  this is a thread about gay marriage after all . 
  abortion is legal , euthanasia is n't . 
  when same-sex couples ca n't get married , but hetero couples can , that 's not equality in any way . 
  registered partnerships do n't have the same position as marriages : they ca n't adopt children or inherit each other , just to name two problems . 
  which sucks . 
  i mean seriously , i thought we were a modern , western society ? 
  people are really dumb , really really dumb .
