  and before that , georgia and moldova . 
  goodbyyyeee . 
  smooch . 
  to be fair , that has been included in the maternity box since 2007 . 
  she 's younger than her stepson . 
  the wife is actually not even in her forties yet . 
  raising the question is not the same as accusing . 
  and in this case , raising the question was more than appropriate . 
  in fact , it was their duty as media . 
  you still think he does n't have any bias judging by his behavior ? 
  also the leader of the national broadcasting company yle used to be active in the center party . 
  do n't worry . 
  it 's going to be great . 
  big league . 
  get into an eu university and find a job once you graduate . 
  welcome to the other side , freedom lover !, 
  also making it easy for germany to keep buying russian gas which is undermining our solidarity with ukraine and european safety in general would have been a bad idea . 
  i bet finland 's is slightly higher just to make the dutch come in second place once again . 
  speaking fluent swedish is actually one of the requirements for becoming the lucia . 
  that 's true for \u00c5landers ( \u00e5l\u00e4nningar ) and ostrobothnians ( pampeser ) but i have yet to find a swedish-speaking nylander ( gummil\u00e4nning ) who does n't use or know the least bit of finnish . 
  found the rinkebybo . 
  shhh , do n't reveal that . 
  let 's see how long it takes for the swede to figure it out by himself . 
  it would be a shame if certain metals found their way into said coffee . 
  being petty and playing childish games is what diplomacy basically is . 
  do you want to get assassinated ? 
  that 's how you get assassinated . 
  i 've never seen the second kind outside of finland . 
  i 'm not a big fan of bread but living in holland has made me miss it . 
  it 's really soft and succulent unlike the german blocks you refer to . 
  there are plenty of swedish-language majorities down south . 
  namely raseborg , ing\u00e5 , pargas , and kimito . 
  there are also villages east of helsinki in sipoo , porvoo , and loviisa where the majority speaks swedish even if they do n't form majorities in the whole of the municipality . 
  if you think there 's only those two options , you certainly have n't seen finnish bread . 
  ] ( http://ruoka.fi/wp-content/uploads/s/f/ruokaohje/972015-graavilohi_ruisleipa-630x848.jpg ) what 's wheat good for anyway ? 
  carbs . 
  they make me bloated . 
  the quality of life here in nl is noticeably better than in east germany for crying out loud . 
  the data used for the map is faulty . 
  yeah , i see that . 
  but places 30 minutes outside of rotterdam and amsterdam are in the yellow . 
  all of flanders is at least orange . 
  randstad is orange at best . 
  thanks for the downvote . 
  i have lived in both countries . 
  currently living in the hague , a city similar in size compared to helsinki , and the price levels for both rental and owned , especially owned , are really low to me . 
  also , if you do n't believe my anecdote , just look at these links : https://www.statista.com/statistics/503274/average-rental-cost-apartment-europe/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5fpwap/map_average_rent_of_a_25_square_meters_apartment/?ref=search_posts https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4j9e4p/cost_of_living_by_city_consumer_price_index_plus/?ref=search_posts https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4kziz7/average_rent_in_european_cities_euros_per_square/, 
  i want to go for that 1800 's judge look . 
  just fuck my shit up , fam . 
  dude went from istanbul to t\u00f3rshavn . 
  housing is way more expensive in finland . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've stuck with my finnish habits of having an omelette for breakfast and a hot meal for lunch , and that 's pretty northern to me . 
  eating bread all the time is a weird continental custom . 
  it was 10 degrees today in the hague . 
  went without a coat . 
  southern europe confirmed . 
  why is holland doing so much worse than flanders ? 
  i doubt it 's that much more expensive . 
  also because the osce were not welcome . 
  as in fired at . 
  `` osce military observers attempted to enter the region four times but were turned away , sometimes after warning shots were fired , [ 105 ] [ 106 ] which was another reason given for not dispatching referendum observers . 
  like / u/autopotato mentioned , the secession was legal . 
  but even if it were n't , why are you expecting the legal framework to be followed when the annexation was at least as legally dubious ? 
  as long as there is no internationally recognized referendum on , russia has no claim to crimea . 
  we helsinkians should build a wall on ring iii and make the farmers pay for it . 
  or elfstedentocht . 
  there , i said it . 
  someone had to . 
  welcome to reality . 
  you 'll never see willem-alexander on skates again . 
  djast dutsj dings . 
  doo n't aask so mennie kwestions , hoor . 
  it 's been a difficult reference season for birdperson . 
  yes , for sim-only too . 
  everything besides prepaid , which is even more expensive , requires commitment . 
  assuming you speak german , you should be able to navigate the dutch websites : https://www.t-mobile.nl/mobiel-abonnement/sim-only https://mobiel.kpn.com/sim-only/budget/2-jaar shit 's expensive . 
  i live in the netherlands and getting a phone subscription here was a shock . 
  firstly , you have to commit to it for at least a year and getting 20gb of data comes at a price of 30 euros a month . 
  back home in finland , i paid 13 euros for unlimited data . 
  some companies do n't even do data caps in finland . 
  i know [ dna ] ( http://dna.fi ) does n't . 
  yeah , you 're below us . 
  bigger is better , now * hup * up to my level , bog boy . 
  he has the bitterballs . 
  yeah , we definitely do not have better roads than sweden and germany , having driven through both countries twice . 
  finland has some of the worst roads in western europe , hands down . 
  but the netherlands really deserve their victory . 
  the roads here in holland are fucking pristine . 
  \\* inhales * hjo . 
  me too thanks, 
  right !, 
  the hague is really nice . 
  even without the bias i have for it , i would definitely say my favorite city in the netherlands . 
  and dutch is such an underappreciated language . 
  i live in holland so it 's total sacrilege that i have n't gone for it yet but it 's definitely on my list . 
  i would imagine it has to do with us being wealthy and small . 
  we 'd pay more for it than most others but we 'd have to follow the big countries ' orders . 
  i do n't buy the reasoning but , to play the devil 's advocate , if there 's one point of critique to the idea , i 'd probably say that . 
  because all the short people have drowned in floods time and time again ?
