  there 's one on top of verkkokauppa in helsinki : https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.156019,24.9209133,3a,35.4y,8.14h,93.28t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-xaejfhr_wmq%2fv3vqnzk4xoi%2faaaaaaaaqhi%2f7etabprvssmf0f3we9bb1ggqsnl_8cscgcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-xaejfhr_wmq%2fv3vqnzk4xoi%2faaaaaaaaqhi%2f7etabprvssmf0f3we9bb1ggqsnl_8cscgcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya303.54343-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i5660!8i2830, 
  say that to rotterdam . 
  achieved with totally-american freedom units called the metric system . 
  no bribes , just good brothers . 
  there is no corruption in finland . 
  kollektivet has made a few more finland parodies . 
  they also make fun of the swedes . 
  check out partypoopersvenskar which is my favorite . 
  edit : oh god , this one as well . 
  did they purposefully use squished proportions to make her look skinnier ? 
  this , pretty much . 
  even tampere looks like a more populous version of this . 
  as well as kauppatori . 
  i 'd rather see them torn down , to be honest . 
  replace them with any finnish president as long as neither of them is kekkonen . 
  or austria for that matter . 
  we 're all military-trained survivalists . 
  this is about perfect . 
  i do n't know if you guys are just trolling but i think it 's quite obvious that the booze was added afterwards to moisten up the final product , together with the vinegar , i imagine . 
  or at least that 's how i 'd interpret the ingredients with my limited knowledge of baking but could be different in other countries . 
   rich  norwegian pick ~ ~ one ~ ~ both . 
  okay , thanks . 
  =d was just wondering how child-friendly they were because i 've heard of rum in cake but never straight up vodka . 
  i bet he was really happy , seeing that he found 99 kg instead of a nice round 100 . 
  ah yes . 
  what 's better than a creamy salmon soup with a chunk of lastenkoskija melting in it ... 
  i saw a documentary once where they put washing detergent in soviet beer in order to make it foam . 
  how much kossu did you put ? 
  you know you 're rich when you booze cruise * to * finland . 
  helsinki has two korean restaurants that i know of : one on bulevardi and the other one in krunikka . 
  would definitely recommend both even though neither of them makes korean bbq . 
  has revenge porn already been banned in the uk ? 
  there 's a fake dutch town in japan : https://www.google.nl/maps/@33.0844439,129.7867726,3a,60y,237.65h,101.96t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxj229oyahig0ww_wgijehw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656, 
  zuig 'm !, 
  the gaps have been left on purpose so as not to consume all of the green heart . 
  all of randstad would probably be urban sprawl if it was n't for conservation . 
  and i would n't call south holland green at all . 
  it 's all cities and farms , no forests to speak of . 
  it comes from the word `` muoto '' which means shape . 
  i would n't be surprised if there was a prehistoric connection somewhere between shaping things and making them . 
  this is as close of a connection you 're ever going to find between finnish and hungarian , though , i 'm afraid .

  `` we hebben wifi in de trein voor u '' is a real sentence in dutch . 
  and you guys insist it 's its own language . 
  you think they work ? 
  cute . 
  not a single violation by finland . 
  you 're welcome , brother . 
   so , naturally , there are ties and claims that would remain unresolved after finland declared independence . 
  what would those be and why were they not solved diplomatically in the 22 years of finnish independence that preceded ? 
   could it be that a 3rd party state was involved in the soviet/finnish conflict ? 
  in other words , the shelling was done with intent to provoke the soviet union against finland ? 
  there is plenty of documentation proving the false flag attack and plenty of more contemporary soviet/russian presidents have denounced the attack as needless aggression . 
  please read the wikipedia page ; i have linked to it elsewhere in this thread . 
   what makes the siege more germany 's doing than finland 's ? 
  the fact that finland , quite simply , did not participate . 
  go ahead and blame us for the holocaust , nuking japan , and the 2008 financial crisis , too , while you 're at it . 
  we were just as guilty in those three . 
   finland did want eastern karelia . 
  check . 
  source ? 
  i 've heard of the fringe idea of greater finland but it was never a state policy . 
   finland did want the war . 
  not at the time , of course . 
  a bit later . 
  ugh , just no . 
  wtf . 
   it was only a matter of time when finland would start shelling leningrad . 
  care to provide a source because i 'm pretty damn sure that did n't happen because finland did n't even participate in the siege ? 
  as i stated before , finland never wanted war . 
  there was nothing to be won from going up against an empire of 170 million when you do n't even have 4 million people yourself . 
  your claims are absolutely asinine . 
  did you even read the post ? 
   it rationally explained how the war became inevitable . 
  the war was never inevitable . 
  we never wanted it or asked for it . 
  we would have been happy to peacefully coexist . 
  i do n't know . 
  i was n't expecting it either , to be honest . 
  while i do agree with the latter half of your comment , the eu is by far the best that we 've got . 
  europe has got to forge its own way forward in this tumultuous world . 
  estimates vary , but similar numbers died in the holodomor as in the holocaust . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor and that 's not to mention the gulags . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag#gulag_used_for_cultural_genocide total estimates vary between 8 and 60 million during the stalinist period . 
  to be fair , it 's not like nato could be trusted either , now that trump laughs in the face of article 5 and conspires with the enemy himself . 
  europe needs common defense direly . 
  i hold both nazi germany and the soviet union to the same standard . 
  they 're both genocidal , expansionist shit empires . 
  here 's three links for you to click through : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qv0xt/russian_staterun_tv_station_zvezda_rewriting/dl06qoc/, 
   only point i was making is soviets won . 
  eh , that 's mostly a technicality . 
  let 's not kid ourselves that their goal was to annex finland just like the baltic states , in accordance with the ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
  compared to their goal , gaining just enough land to bury their hundreds of thousands of casualties was a complete lose-lose situation . 
  everyone does . 
  we also remember the finnish jews who fought on the finnish/german side because they saw the germans as the lesser of two evils . 
  none of them died in the holocaust . 
   ah , if they did n't fight and actually gave soviets what they wanted they would have lost less territory . 
  give the soviets a pinky and they chop off the whole hand .
