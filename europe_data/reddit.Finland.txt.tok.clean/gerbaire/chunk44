  just look at what happened to our neighbors in the south . 
  we had to nip in the bud . 
   i 'm not necessarily bothered or insulted if russians want to lie to each other . 
  i would n't be too worried if someone like zhirinovsky said this . 
  but this is coming from the state television . 
  this calls for a diplomatic response on finland 's part , in my opinion . 
  this can not go without correction . 
  also gib moar lebensraum around ~ ~ st. 
  not to mention how many people stalin got killed . 
  hitler pales in comparison . 
  the lies run deep . 
  the west in general . 
  the point of the article is to convince readers that europe , even the allies , conspired against the soviets by surrendering to the nazis and/or supporting the finns .

  they should be banned altogether . 
  highways should be for everyone just like all other infrastructure . 
  he 's next on the list . 
  cancerous things that should be banned by the eu . 
   for example , i can easily go to a supermarket in 95 % russian-speaking narva and be sure i will always have product information , prices etc in estonian language , but it 's not the same for russian . 
  that 's because the country 's laws only oblige to do that with estonian . 
  also , despite russian being very common in estonian websites , it 's not always there . 
  for example , the country 's most popular theatre , the state real estate company or the finance ministry are websites i quickly found that are available only in estonian and english . 
   things become even more one-sided with eu stuff , where there 's very little information available in russian as it 's not an official eu language . 
  that does n't matter at all because that is determined by de jure . 
  i 'm sure there would be more russian if it was n't considered provocative by estonian-speakers . 
  the bottom line is , 30 % of the people in estonia speak estonian as their native tongue and in they day-to-day lives . 
  regardless of legal status or migration history , that 's very close to belgium levels of bilingualism where the split is 60-40 . 
   baltics are not officially bilingual and you might trigger some people when you call them such . 
  lithuania , sure , but if an estonian or a latvian does n't accept the fact that their countries have become de facto bilingual , against the will of the local population or not , they ought to be checked into a mental asylum . 
  because language is an * extremely * touchy subject . 
  welcome to the world of bilingual countries . 
  does anyone have a theory for why ? 
  can confirm . 
   although this is sad to hear , it does support my original point that the us is economy is in the lead , although that might no always be the case . 
  the eurozone is outperforming the us . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-economy-gdp-iduskbn17z0uk  the eu , eurozone , and the uk also all rank pretty highly as well on percent of gdp as debt , with each being around 80-90 % of debt as gdp compared to the us ' 107 % look at the figures again . 
  us debt is increasing at an alarming rate . 
  in just five years , us govt debt will be pushing 120 % while eurozone is down to the 70 's . 
   all china 's and the eu 's gdp ppp being higher than the us just basically says that both of them have a weaker , more devalued currency , which is better for exporters like germany . 
  uh no . 
  that 's not how that works , and while a weak currency is good for exports , it is actually hurting german consumers and their purchasing power more than creating jobs , causing sluggish growth because too much is spent on foreign essentials . 
  after all , germany 's export surplus is only .2 -.3 billion usd , which is nothing , seeing that germany is the world 's third largest exporter . 
  both merkel and sch\u00e4uble have come out highlighting this problem in the media this year . 
   can you prove this ? 
  https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/06/63-of-americans-dont-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-500-emergency/#283645cf4e0d i 'm a financially independent student ( read : poor ) but i can definitely afford a few 500-dollar emergencies . 
  does that mean i 'm better off than 63 % of americans while having very little income ? 
  what 's more , a large share of the american economy is funded with foreign debt . 
  borrowed money is n't wealth . 
  click on the arrows to put the countries in decreasing order . 
  i mean , they were german cities before wwii , like the title says . 
  get yourself a bucket . 
  whether that 's gdp per capita nominally or per purchasing power , still nah brah . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita not to mention how screwed up your division of wealth is . 
  half of americans live in relative poverty while the 1 % possess 35 % of all wealth in the country . 
  there are two keys to success in the military : you do what you 're told and you do n't give up when your body tells you to . 
  non-combat military is actually quite stress-free because the only thing you have to do is follow orders . 
  literally everything else is organized for you . 
  this i can tell you from experience . 
  being under fire and having to kill , however , must be very stressful experiences that induce ptsd . 
  that stuff affects anyone , transgender or cis . 
   us being a mile ahead of everyone else in a cross country race uhh , about that ... 
  no finns participating , though . 
  sorry , mattie ... http://www.gelatoworldtour.com/gelato-artisans/european-finals/, 
   i see our independence does n't mean anything , what a nice way to put it ... :d do the \u00c5landers really see it that way ? 
  not very many . 
  you just made it * really * easy for anybody to doxx you and out you as an arrogant racist . 
  i 'd be more careful . 
  damn right . 
  much love to new norway , too . 
  how come your username is in comic sans ? 
  it 's nasty . 
  and it 's made from milk , believe it or not . 
  a bit like sprite but less chemical and more flowery . 
  the ginger ale analogy is decent , too . 
  keeps you going . 
  huh , i passed . 
  i got everything but the names of people right . 
  the first picture you linked is actually [ puu-vallila ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@60.1930584,24.9581458,3a,35.2y,140.48h,94.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1a3yw0izywmkqz_anchikq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) .

  i 've traveled there 7 ( ? ), 
  times now . 
  most people speak italian or valdotain ( a local language , can be described as somewhere between french and italian ) at home but people do speak french there too . 
  oh my god . 
  thanks for saving my day !, 
  nordic countries gon na nordic , i guess . 
  sigh . 
  i 'm guessing they included non-active thc metabolites in the count , too .

  no , i actually found it hilarious !, 
  the high chart and our favorite barista make for a dope combination . 
  wish we had beer .

  haha , reps !, 
  my guess : pink - parks and natural sights green - historical constructions purple - attractions and theme parks however , many of them are quite arbitrary and misplaced , like nyhavn , if my guesses are anywhere near the true meaning behind the colors . 
  because german cars are so fuel efficient , she can drive to warsaw with just one tank . 
  and a third finn won the championship last year and retired immediately after winning . 
  man , i pass that place every day on my daily walks . 
  should i go ? 
  is there anything to see as an adult ? 
  about the same but it rained today ie .
