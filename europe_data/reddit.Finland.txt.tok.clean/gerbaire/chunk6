  the former means `` frequently '' and the latter `` occasionally . '', 
  here 's three examples of `` ever so often '' : [ link 1 ] ( http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-sa-para+hills-115142015 ) [ link 2 ] ( http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/yosemite_tales_and_trails/trees.html ) [ link 3 ] ( http://www.thenotsosecretlifeofanadoptee.com/2013/01/us-supreme-court-taking-american-indian.html ), 
   no one should learn to speak swedish , it 's a waste of time . 
  i like how you can do an old germanic flip with the pronoun and the verb every now and then , even though english is a strictly svo language . 
  `` ever so often does it rain in england . '', 
  and if you want to use the good old subjunctive you hated in french class : `` should that happen , i 'll give you a call . '', 
   but there is definitely a ** case ** to be made for accusative - dative . 
  i see what you did there . 
   does n't finnish make do without articles at all ? 
  sounds even better to me . 
  yes , though it 's not as easy as you think . 
  finnish does n't make a distinction between definite and indefinite singulars , but there is a similar distiction between the plurals ( partitive `` autoja '' vs nominative `` autot '' , '' ( some ) cars '' vs `` the cars '' ) . 
  whatever crap you have in front of a noun in english , you pretty much always add it to end in finnish . 
  ( even with his car -  auto * llansakin * ), 
  so were all indo-european languages , to my knowledge . 
  they all had three genders , but modern languages have often fused them . 
  romance languages tend to fuse masculine and neuter together ( french , spanish , italian all have masc and fem , whereas latin had all three ) and germanic languages fuse masculine and feminine ( swedish and danish have two genders , common and neuter , and dutch and norwegian have dialects which can have either two or three . 
  icelandic has retained all three . ), 
   tv news presenter danish ( which sounds like less bouncy norwegian ) whaaat . 
  i need to hear this . 
  when i went to denmark last summer , i went to starbucks , and ordered in swedish . 
  i felt really stupid , but that 's the only kind of danish i 've ever heard . 
  edit : i just realized that this happened in ama * ' * . 
  judging by the current political climate , i have a feeling finland should be orange . 
  meh , i do n't really feel like spending a ton of money on stuff that tastes like shit and gives you a terrible headache in the morning . 
  but that 's just me ... [ vappusima / valborgsmj\u00f6d ] ( http://svenska.yle.fi/recept/2010/04/26/valborgsmjod ) is the only thing i 've liked so far . 
  yup , neither is croatia or bulgaria . 
  never said it was . 
  i do n't drink . 
  i 'm seriously fucked for life . 
  something about this makes me really happy . 
  i mean , i love you and stuff , but haa haa , sweden !, 
  ... creating a few new countries while at it . 
  amager , also known as ama ^ ~ ~ ger ~ ~ . 
  mofo took me days to figure out what they were talking about . 
  schengen is * passport * - free travel . 
  you 're irish , so you do n't belong to the schengen area , which means that you will need a passport like the moldovans . 
  but not a visa because the eu is awesome like that . 
  now the moldovans are getting the same rights . 
  that tiny bit west of istanbul probably , the rest nah . 
  it 's easy , just crack your voice when saying the last syllable of the sentence : `` snakker du norsk ^ ** da ** ? 
   consonants or , as they call them in wales , letters . 
  they do n't know of any other kind . 
  but , mom !, 
  genocides are so much fun !, 
  `` suihku '' always means `` shower . '', 
  however , if you combine it with `` kone '' , it becomes `` suihkukone '' ( shower machine ) which means `` jet engine . '', 
  makes sense , right ? 
  you missed one of the three f 's . 
  yes , i have an ocd . 
  saying '' \u00c5land is a part of finland '' is like saying `` espoo is n't just another word for west helsinki . '', 
  i mean , you 're right , but c'mon , let 's be real . 
  barely counts ... = /, 
  whereas tiny finland pushed them back for good *** and *** kept the russians at bay . 
   ( i suppose that 's a play on star wars and yoda , with the flying pen and the use of macht which is what the force is called in star wars . 
   ) i thought german grammar was being a little too german for a second when i read it the original . 
  such relief i feel . 
  it 's not an age thing , apathy is part of today 's culture , which is shown by statistics . 
  the number of people who show up at the polling stations is going down as steadily as the populace replacing itself . 
  unfortunately , young folks do n't vote as much . 
  if you folks decided to flip the bird at the eu , we would visa the bloody cunt out of you . 
  just so you know . 
  we do n't like what switzerland did to us , so we showed them , and we would n't worry about doing it to you too . 
   `` united , the french are invincible . '', 
  has n't really worked in the past , has it now ? 
  nissan leaf is an affordable option . 
  that top post climaxed to an awesome plot twist , did you see it ? 
  * `` i like how you thrust your plunger into the toilet hole , mmmh ... 
  ya big plumber man !, 
  oh boy , you might want to browse reddit a little more . 
  there is * everything * here . 
  not really , i watch it for the acting . 
  ah , now i see what you were asking . 
  the way i see it is that it 's not so much the differences in gdp/cap or infrastructure ( i think similar disparities can be found between for example alabama and manhattan in the us ) but more of the linguistic and cultural differences . 
  a spaniard might find it hard to get used to the work culture and language ( s ) in , say , finland , and their diplomas might not be as highly valued as local ones . 
  whereas someone from miami can find a job in seattle and move there in a heartbeat and face no obstacles whatsoever , which is a sign of a highly integrated society . 
  so it 's more about the lack of mixing and communication between all of the countries in europe that hinders the process of integration . 
  also many worry about their countries losing their independence during this rough patch in the history of the eu . 
  something about this is very unsettling to me . 
  maybe it 's the previous great austrian leader that makes me worry , but i 'm not sure . 
  wait , whose ? 
  germany alone is * waayy * richer than russia . 
  i do n't know . 
  though , i 've heard that there are germans in the west of czech republic . 
  but that would be the last expansion for sure . 
  right ? 
  ** ] ( http://boyars.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/7/1/18719230/1167189_orig.jpg ), 
  something tells me this is slightly worrisome . 
  you ( we ? ), 
  already forgot in 1809 , i 'm afraid ... 
  i did say `` quality . '', 
  ... says someone from the biggest country in the nordics . 
  you guys just want our money and you ask for a crazy price `` because nordic quality comes at a price . '', 
  and then you make us assemble it ourselves . 
  hardly non-alignment in any case . 
  it 's funny how sweden still calls itself a neutral country . 
  good that they at least picked the lesser of the two evils . 
  probably easier to swim to the moon . 
   you don \u00b4 t have a criminal investigation police at least ? 
  yes , but they do n't patrol the streets .
