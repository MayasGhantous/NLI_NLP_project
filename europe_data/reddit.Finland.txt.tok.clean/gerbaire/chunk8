  either way , you 're going to end up with people who are dissatisfied . 
  while i do n't directly dislike the current representative system we have , i 'd like to give have social questions ( such as gay marriage ) to the hands of direct democracy and have them kept away as far as possible from age-old representatives who are completely divorced from modern reality . 
  there are upsides and drawbacks to both systems . 
  can someone eli5 me really quickly ?

  thanks again , sweden !, 
  are you me ? 
  the first thing i said to my dad when i realized the fifth circle was n't going to open was `` well , somebody got fired ... ! '', 
  to which he replied `` nah , he 's going to get siberia 'd . '', 
  this would be like finland . 
  just add awkward silence . 
   even our pitch-black and desert-dry icelandic humour is horribly non-nordic . 
  that 's the definition of nordic humor . 
  the one about finnish introverts and extroverts . 
  pssh , back in the days when we still had nokia , we shipped cameras all over the world and everyone was all over that stuff -- knowingly !, 
  i understand swedes and norwegians without any difficulty . 
  you isolationist danish however ... you 're even populating your tiny sand dune of a country with tiny , yellow terracotta soldiers made of plastic and send some of them off to infiltrate the rest of the world . 
  talk about weird . 
  and you say you guys understand it just fine ? 
  one word : kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 . 
  at least we pronounce every single one of them with extreme care . 
  apparently it 's ok ( or \u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4 \u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 as we say in finland ) in dk to drop the latter half of words and disregard the rest . 
  says the dane . 
  none . 
  but everyone remembers our historical provinces ( nylandia , finland proper , karelia , laponia , ostrobothnia , satakunta , savonia , tavastia , \u00c5land ) from finnish classes , because linguistic and dialectal differences follow the historical borders and not so much the current ones . 
  i would n't say we lost , it was a loss for the soviets that they were n't able to take us over . 
  that 's a huge victory in a david vs. goliath position . 
  it 'd be sad if someone got mad at you for bringing it up . 
  collaborating with the nazis was vital for our national defense : we had to choose the lesser of two evils : oppressive , murderous soviets right across the border or oppressive , murderous nazis across a large sea and who could n't give a crap about us but could use a helping hand in defeating our common enemy . 
  kind of a no-brainer as bad as it sounds . 
  but how would that hurt * finnish * pride ? 
  i remember being in a state of manic depression for two months after seeing that movie . 
  goodbye lenin is one of my personal favorites . 
  it tells the story of the fall of the berlin wall from a very interesting angle . 
  sounds like your average saturday night in s\u00f6rn\u00e4inen , huh ... 
  very stereotypical , but i guess stereotypes have to stem from somewhere . 
  in a country the size of finland or denmark , already one murder makes a big statistical difference , and knives and alcohol * can * play a role in how the difference is created . 
  i know you 're not supposed to comment `` this '' but i 'll do it anyway : this . 
  well , there is n't much you could say that could hurt our feelings . 
  yes , we lost some land , but we kept the soviets out and drove out the nazis . 
  i mean , the [ figures speak for themselves .

  whether or not the stats you offered are at all credible , i will not comment . 
  that will only lead to a discussion that 's even further off-topic . 
  however , i can guarantee you that a great percentage of all homosexuals live in denial , afraid to accept themselves and to come out to their friends and family . 
  well * that * i can agree with .

  empathy is also humane . 
  whichever you tend to emphasize more -- tolerance or uniformity -- determines how you would turn out without outside influence . 
  what do you mean little ? 
  say 10 % of all people are gay . 
  i can only imagine how hard it would be to be gay if one did n't have amazing self-confidence . 
  if we use the same assumption , this issue touches directly 700 million people worldwide . 
  i would n't call that a small problem . 
  derogatory words be derogatory .
