they think they 're heading towards total world domination , but they 'll just end up like the nazis . 
  maybe russia will be split in the end like east russia for china and west russia as a part of eu . 
  til : sweden has been deserted . 
  the grass was greener back then . 
  the nokia patent portfolio is an additional deal of about one and a half billion per decade , in addition to giving nokia free access to microsoft 's portfolio . 
  this , in addition to inheriting the four billion debt of nokia devices . 
  i 'd say this was an excellent deal to nokia , who does n't have to deal with getting strangled by their shitty phone business anymore . 
  this was good news to nokia and another nail in the coffin for microsoft , who has to subvent phones in addition to tablets and consoles now . 
  it actually looked more like a shrew ( p\u00e4\u00e4st\u00e4inen ) . 
  those are related closer to elephants than mice .

  it 's not like the computer has eyes and would know what 's printed on the keys . 
  how do you see any correlation or causation for that matter in that map and the one of the post ? 
  i mean , just look at them . 
  at least in finnish , words are pronounced like they 're written ; every letter corresponds to the pronounciation of the letters . 
  it 's kakka in finnish . 
  i lived in texas for a few months during the summer . 
  50 \u00b0 c was unbearable , almost like going to a sauna , and getting into a car that had been sitting in the sun was as hot as a sauna , just not as humid .

  in liberia it seems to be like that as well . 
  they are just shy of the camera . 
  this has the thing fairly well covered . 
  both chinese and japanese websites are translated into fairly understandable english . 
  no problem there . 
  i do that regularly when searching for some fairly obscure details about certain electronics . 
  not necessarily , if you factor in the inflation as well . 
  same in finland , where the price bubble has grown uncontrolled since 1980 's , mostly because the government backed the failed banks with public debt in the early 90 's . 
  yeah , but it 's not a comma either ; it 's a white-space . 
  that 's similar price to what i paid for something similar in early 2000 's , docsis 1.0 cable modem stuff . 
  i 've been stuck with 100mbps down for a decade ; it 's not funny and prices have just halved or something during the time . 
  i want/need something like 1gbps down , 100mbps up ( or even 100/100 ) , but it 's not being offered due to too many being content with just 100mbps down and whatever up . 
  there 's no such thing as too much bandwidth . 
  there 's always some use for it , which are basically unthinkable of if you do n't have it already .

  it 's fairly stable , being fiber and all , but i 'd like some real competition here . 
  `` hammer '' comes from ancient finnish `` hamara '' . 
  it 's `` vasara '' in modern finnish , though , but the blunt edge of axes are still called hamara . 
  they operate back and forth on a short dead-ended street on a basically defunct ex-industry area where they do n't have to yield for any traffic apart from pedestrians . 
  no , either do or do not do something . 
  there 's no `` do nothing together '' as in `` hang out '' . 
  you can do `` do nothing '' alone . 
  introverted social standards rather than extroverted . 
  it 's a good place to be for an introvert , especially since most other countries have extroverted social standards . 
  even then it does n't matter , since it has a driver sitting in it as a fail-safe anyway . 
  it 's a really simple and slow robot operating on a straight street with a dead end and no crossing traffic . 
  all it has to do is stay on its lane and stop if it detects obstacles . 
  it was the same drill , it 's just that the finnish press was mostly silent about the finnish implications of it . 
  gotland is too close to nato-supported areas and much harder to defend since it 's just a single flat island . 
  iirc , it was covered in that article . 
  it 's not about attacking finland , it 's about controlling the baltic sea region . 
  occupation of finland and the rest of the nordics , if it 's a priority to them , wo n't probably be much different from their other recent land grabs . 
  with the distinction that gotland has military presence . 
  \u00c5land being a prime target is documented in ~ ~ some russian military strategy leaks ~ ~ * an article * i read some time ago ~ ~ , but they could 've been documents from the soviet era though ~ ~ * and it 's apparently the current plan * . 
  the general idea is that its location and archipelago makes for a good strategic location for a naval and airfoce base easy to defend once established . 
  it being demilitarized means it 's also easy to capture . 
  edit : found [ an article about it ] ( http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/ulkomaat/eurooppa/suurvallat-kiinnostuivat-itameresta-venaja-ei-halua-naton-sisamerta/ ) ( in finnish ) , and since it 's paywalled , [ here 's the text ] ( http://pastie.org/private/5v68tghcbgqg9tdbxs3aw ) . 
  \u00c5land as a demilitarized area is a huge liability to finland . 
  if/when the next war in the area starts , it 's one of the first strategic places russians are going to invade . 
  yes and sweden is just the northern tip of denmark . 
  basically `` right wing '' as-in `` aryan power '' , as-in iranian as-in `` the land of the aryan people '' . 
  must be opossum-kin as well , those are always opressed . 
  probably something like  50 % of the population , but it 's too late to do anything about it at that point . 
   it 's lower for me now than it was in the us did you account for the hidden taxes your employer pays for your salary before you see your paycheck ? 
  [ the supreme leader of finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) seems to be in the spotlight now : http://i.imgur.com/ux57147.png, 
  really , let 's look at your original claim , which is the opposite of what the map is about :  you 're misinterpreting the map . 
  the map does n't show how much of the vocabulary is shared - it shows the time when the languages have split from a common ancestor . 
  you 're a perfect example of that . 
  danish , swedish and norwegian were basically the same language just a few centuries ago . 
  due to political borders , they then became isolated dialects and started to evolve differences large enough to be considered different languages . 
  not quite . 
  more like uhh ( like getting punched ) nay ( like no in pirateish ) news ( like in news ), 
  in finnish `` ahmed ahne '' ( ahmed the greedy ), 
  of course , since only fools would prefer them . 
  naminam is the best place , though . 
  the inuits did n't have the ocean-capable boats , just kayaks suitable for short distances . 
  is that supposed to be an url , since it is n't and there is n't a server responding to postimg.com either . 
  similar to other northern or otherwise isolated and low density places : for instance an otherwise survivable stab wound becomes lethal when it takes hours to get to the nearest hospital . 
  obviously  25 years ago , since it 's been more than 25 years since the soviet union collapsed . 
  selling high-tech industrial stuff to the soviets was a large part of the economy . 
  the exceptions were the winters of little snow ; see my post above , i added some snow graphs to it . 
  idiots do , but that 's why normal people do n't smile . 
  probably last year or the year before that , or the year before that . 
  it 's not usually super snowy this soon of the winter ; january is coming . 
  edit : for all you doubters ; helsinki does get its share of snow every year and the years of very little snow are the exception . 
  the first snow staying on ground for the rest of the winter does typically fall very late in the year or even early the next year , but it stays on the ground typically until mid-april . 
  [ here are some nice graphs for helsinki ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/jm48d ) ^ [ source ] ( http://www.eeki.biz/lumen_syvyys.php?nimi=lumensyvyys_historia ) , the vertical axis is the average depth of snow and horizontal is date : * [ 2016-2017 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hlhggls.png ) * [ 2015-2016 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xw9ivvx.png ) * [ 2014-2015 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zsax0kl.png ) * [ 2013-2014 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/blqj5d3.png ) * [ 2012-2013 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y36li7s.png ) * [ 2011-2012 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xvm0fqw.png ) * [ 2010-2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fzuvz93.png ) * [ 2009-2010 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fexqmye.png ) * [ 2008-2009 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/teq1icv.png ) * [ 2007-2008 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zxyoesa.png ) * [ 2006-2007 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t3jthjm.png ) * [ 2005-2006 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ewyrzs7.png ) * [ 2004-2005 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qstd1zz.png ) * [ 2003-2004 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yj8m3vn.png ) * [ 2002-2003 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sca2ofx.png ) * [ 2001-2002 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/71uazuw.png ) * [ 2000-2001 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mreqq63.png ) what makes it worse in helsinki than the rest of finland is that ever since the green party rose to power in early 2000 's , snow removal capacity was mostly cut down since they thought climate change means the abnormally low amounts of snow in early 2000 's was the new normal . 
  if you need a car in helsinki , get an all-wheel-drive one ; preferrably terrain-capable . 
  in the rest of the country , almost any car will do fine . 
  pneumatic , just like the brakes .
