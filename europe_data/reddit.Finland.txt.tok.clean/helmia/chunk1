yeah , brexit taught me people actually consider daily mail as a source of ( what they think is ) reliable information . 
  i honestly ca n't think of a shittier tabloid than dm . 
  it truly is the definition of a trash media . 
   some countries are not too friendly and what those countries would be ? 
  happy independence day poland . 
   who said anything about a failed country ? 
  ** is it wrong to strive to be better ? 
  ** absolutely not , that was a poor choice of words and has a lot to do with the fact my english is n't that good . 
   britain has always prided itself on being a world leader and world beater however we still understand in this world there is no resting and we keep working hard . 
  do n't confuse pride with arrogance , we are prideful yes and yea we might throw in a couple of things about the war but lets be honest , if it was n't for the uk and it 's empire , germany would have won we should be allowed to boast a little among our friends . 
  well the messages i have received in here have been nothing but arrogance , entitled , ignorant arrogance ( like saying shit that britain was n't really responsible for the bengal famine , britain invented democracy and other ridiculous crap ) and i am pretty sure i am not confusing anything . 
  of course there is a possibility i have completely mistaken about the real meaning of the word arrogance ( meaning arrogance = feeling you do n't have to improve yourself anymore ) . 
  to me arrogant means a feeling of superiority , cockiness , egoism , being bossy . 
  my point is that this  the british have and always will undervalue ourselves . 
  is bullshit and you know it . 
  wanting to get better has nothing to do with undervaluing yourself . 
  just read your own text if you need assurance . 
  you are not undervaluing yourself as a nation , and to say something like that after what happened in summer is just funny . 
  you are very arrogant as nation , have always been ( there was a reason you were an empire ) , but you have a lot of reason to be so it is okay . 
  just wanting to point out the humble brag i guess . 
   do you think my company can get any worse ? 
  well yeah . 
  we could have been , you know , not there . 
   i dunno , what are ** finlanders ** like ? 
  dear lord , let this be a joke i am too stupid/too much in the internet to read the tone to get . 
  i do n't remember where it was but i remember reading that irish soldier are fucking crazy . 
  like just nuts . 
  you know , brave to the point it makes you question their sanity and wonder what 's wrong with them . 
  damn i wish i remember where it was , if i do i will link it . 
   the entire idea of the world 's largest army is so fucking terrifying . 
  why do you think it would be the world 's largest ? 
  china and usa , probably russia would very likely still be bigger than us . 
  and there is nothing terrifying in an army that is for defensive purposes only . 
  it is comforting . 
  unless you guys are planning to attack us , there is no reason to consider it terrifying . 
  altough i would n't be that surprised about that either anymore . 
  kinda . 
  this . 
  exactly this . 
  this simply can not be true , we have absolutely zero reasons not to want an eu army . 
  we have been scared shitless to even talk about nato ( everyone knows why ) but eu army would be pretty much the best thing possible . 
  i have to say the most arrogant and strangely i-base-my-identity-on-my-nationality i have met in reddit have been british . 
  i ca n't count how many times a british redditor has been acting like a complete asshole and throwing ww2 events as an insult and way of underlining their own greatness compared to the other . 
  52 % of british voters just voted to leave eu because they want to `` take their country back '' and because they feel british , not european . 
  because we usually see the world the way we are , i have a strong feeling this is your way of talking about you and the people you know , and i totally believe that to be true . 
  britts do have a fantastic dry sense of humour and a wonderful way of humbly making fun of themselves . 
  however , overall , i would like to very much disagree . 
  as a nation you do not see yourself as a failed country . 
  there are millions of people living there thinking you are the best people and best country in this planet earth . 
  saying `` oh britts are so ashamed to be british '' is the same as `` oh swedes are so ashamed to be swedish '' . 
  they can talk or act humbly but they know damn well it is n't true . 
  hehe well it 's not really a thing really . 
  or maybe it is , since we drink alcohol in every form possible . 
  but enjoy that coffee and vodka , i have a feeling you need it buddy . 
  i just wanted to remain everyone that the united states of america has a president that considers global warming to be a concept created by the chinese . 
  that is a perfectly ordinary sentence . 
  i did n't even realize that !, 
  yes ? 
  when the emperor falls so does the dogs in its lap ? 
  people will learn the language that is important to learn . 
  that simple . 
  and it will happen . 
   always has and will be . 
  always has ? 
  well there 's the answer why you guys voted for trump . 
  and nope , you just voted yourself out of that position . 
   rofl to suggest otherwise especially from a peasant borderline island relevant country like finland . 
  umm what ? 
   but a lot of people still dislike us anyway , ** even if we are n't causing harm to anyone . 
  let me get this straight : you commented to say i am never going to learn chinese ? 
   this is the world leader not anymore honey, 
   usa , russia , and uk alliance . 
  lol , uk ?? 
  nope , it is russia and china , usa being their bitch . 
   time to step up ** eu ** / nato , you may not have the us to rely on for much longer about nato you are right , that is gone . 
  but what comes to eu , dear god you are stupid . 
  there we go . 
  america 's honourable president , mr. donald `` grab her by the pussy '' trump . 
  my friends are reading aloud things trump have said . 
  we are on abortion rights right now . 
  this is just even better than i imagined . 
  of course he is . 
  russia wants to be the world 's leading power and eventually it will be . 
  `` the west '' is cracking up . 
  hey have you met u/sandberg023 ? 
  i am sure you guys would get along great . 
  no i am not going to deal with you guys right now , find someone else to bother ok ? 
  hey you guys are screwed too . 
  your isolationism depends on usa 's support . 
  hey [ dear troll ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/58bf7y/finland_is_becoming_increasingly_worried_about/d8z2vju/ ) would you mind fucking off for _ once _ ? 
   like let 's get back to this tomorrow or sometime , i do n't feel like dealing with shits like you right now . 
  brexit and trump . 
  i ca n't imagine better news to putin . 
  i guessi should start learning chinese because the new lingua franca is going to change . 
  this means ukraine 's sanctions will be dropped . 
  ww3 it is . 
  seriously i am fucking terrified . 
  nato is gone , finland + baltics + probably swedem belongs to russia 's circle right now . 
  i just ca n't believe usa is n't the world superpower anymore . 
  this is the biggest change imaginable .
