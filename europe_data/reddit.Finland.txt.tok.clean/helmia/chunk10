  i would love to hear more about the unbiased theories from nikolai `` shellings of mainila never happened and the whole winter war was simply soviets defending themselves '' bary\u0161nikov . 
  yep , this . 
  unfortunately we were forced to ally with the germans in order to survive ( and after losing to the soviets to chase them away ) , however the wasn \u00b4 t a sinlge finnish jew handed over and our leaders ( mannerheim for example ) made clear that they are out of reach and just like any other finn . 
  that \u00b4 s why i was confused , but i guess you can \u00b4 t expect more from someone whose post history seems to be filled with [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54vun0/germany_preparing_plans_to_bail_out_deutsche_bank/d85ewgm ) kind of crap . 
  edit : fortunately the comments were removed . 
  overall he is a troll who has wandered too far from r/the _ donald so i don \u00b4 t really see what he is doing here anyway . 
  mm , yes , and . . ? 
  sorry i am just confused what your point is . 
   you guys have 10 types of cabbage and ** genocide ** isn \u00b4 t it wonderful you guys don \u00b4 t have such things weighing on your national conscience , otherwise your joke would have been just dumb , 
  username checks out . 
  yes , exactly , that is naturally the most important part . 
  the things is all the women i know that are the same age as me and already have a child ( or two ) are single moms , no one is still together with the father . 
  also they all struggle with money too . 
  i find it strange i am told that i am at the best age of having kids while looking at the real life examples are nothing but encouraging . 
  many people are not lucky enough to find a good man/woman until later in life and it is n't really something you should be blamed on . . 
  these articles / `` have babies we are dying out '' - hysteria makes me feel like i should just take the first random guy i can find and trap him into fatherhood , nevermind the consequences . 
  being a single mom is hard and i respect those doing handling it but i simply do n't wish it to myself , and i am not going to sacrifice my life in sake of europe/finland or anything else equally stupid . 
  life is n't really so simple that it is only up to your want if you can have children or not . 
  there are so many factories . 
  have you called it ? 
   i love the idea !!, 
  seems so fun . 
  i am 5 years younger than you , a student and only dating a guy i find intetesting . 
  i still have 3 years left on school , have next to nothing savings since my family is n't wealthy ( and even if they were , they would n't support me financially anymore ) . 
  i wish to be married and have a job before having kids . 
  these kind of articles make me feel like i should feel guilty of not popping kids out like there is no tomorrow . 
  the only way of doing that ( since i am so unreasonable i do n't want to raise my children in poverty ) would be a ) marrying someone 10 years older and depend on his money or b ) let the welfare system support us . 
  both of those options are as appealing as chopping my arms off . 
  overall i simply do n't see how motherhood would be possible at women on their early twenties . 
  or tbh why it should even be a problem . 
  f\u00e9licitations !, 
  hope everything goes well . 
  yes , exactly like this , well written . 
  however i would like to point out it was n't solely against the `` resistance movement '' , it was against the rise of far-right populism and political violence ( which is rare in finland , that 's why people are so shocked ) . 
  _ friends _ ?????? 
  what is a governant ( or more like what do you mean with it in this context ) ? 
  where do you base your `` knowledge '' of aupairing ? 
  being the pampered kid with aupairs and _ being _ the aupair are quite different things . 
  i have n't heard of a single aupair who worked for ~ 5 hours a day and got weekends completely off . 
  please , try aupairing . 
  let 's then get back to how good of a deal it is to work for `` pocket money '' . 
   it 's not a job it is n't ? 
  taking care of children ( nannying ) and usually cleaning is not a job ? 
  what is it ? 
  a hobby ? 
  taking care of children is just so joyfull and fun that people want to do it for almost free ? 
  why would people even pay for childcare of housekeeping because according your logic there should exist people wanting to do your laundry and deal with your child 's tantrum for free ? 
   they should get it from their parents where are you from ? 
  do you consider it normal that 19-25 year olds ask their _ parents _ to pay their salary when they move to another country to take care of other people 's children ? 
  what is it ? 
  a holiday ? 
  why mommy and daddy are n't just simply paying for the holiday so the aupair does n't have to waste their time and energy dealing with stranger 's kids ? 
  was n't there the case when a woman died because the doctor refused to do the abortion ? 
  i mean is n't it illegal to do an abortion even when the mother 's life is in risk ? 
  edit : googled it , here it is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_savita_halappanavar also edited my comment because it was incomprehensible, 
  haha my thoughts exactly . 
  5 % , you guys should announce a national state of emergency . 
  we will pray for you to get through these devastating times . 
  no but seriously , norway is like the perfect student that gets upset because he got a 10 - instead of 10 in a test because you guys play on your own level . 
  when i saw this i immediately thought of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vc2jwlcgyg ) . 
  `` i don \u00b4 t really have a lot of sympathy . 
  that \u00b4 s what people say : `` there is too much to do , it \u00b4 s too nice , too clean and we have too much oil and fish '' . 
  your problem really is that the rest of the world exists . '', 
   given only about 10 % of uk businesses export to the eu this is simply not possible . 
  can you provide your source for this ? 
   polish politicians complaining about the rise of `` vegetarians and people who ride bicycles '' i am speechless . 
  the level of stupidity is just out if this world . 
  i was in dublin during the `` pro-life '' rally in the summer of 2013 . 
  let \u00b4 s just say it was quite a culture shock . 
  if i remember correctly , one lady was holding a sing that stated that a rapist gets less jailtime than the woman ( or was it the doctor ? ), 
  who performs the abortion . 
  edit : other things i remember is some kind of politician was on the stage talking how a doctor adviced them to have an abortion in new york but his wife said no and the baby was born healthy . 
  also we found it ridiculous how many people were distributing shit , including an old fat guy who handed us a pamphlet that started with something like `` as a woman i can understand how a woman \u00b4 s heart can ache blaablaa '' . 
  the thing that stuck me the most was probably that the crowd marching seemed to be mostly men . 
  there were women of course and the difference wasn \u00b4 t that striking , but the the amount of young guys marching against abortion ... just the idea of finnish guys doing the same was absurd . 
  isn \u00b4 t the woman innocent too ? 
  the raped woman of course . 
  it does n't matter what situation or what particular case we are talking about - no matter if the woman is raped , or the pregnancy is life threatening , or that she simply does n't want a child . 
  there can be excused designed to explain why abortion is not right in certain situations , but is in others . 
  or then it can be lunatics who want to ban/make it illegal altogether , it simply doesn \u00b4 t matter . 
  the explanation behind each and every single one of these opinions is always the same . 
  that is the idea that the life that already exists , the woman 's , is less important than the life of the fetus . 
  end of story . 
  no matter at what angle you look at the issue . 
  of course they will wrap it up in a prettier package and use religions and other shit as lube , but the core idea is always the same . 
  you don \u00b4 t matter as much as the child you are carrying . 
  what is weird is that these `` pro-life '' people do n't seem to care about the fact that making abortion illegal will always , _ always _ cost lives . 
  also it will injure women and force them to suicide . 
  banning abortion will never stop it . 
  it will simply force women to do it themselves in dangerous methods ( like for example pretty much every country in south america , which has one of the highest numbers of abortions ) or if they have enough money , to travel elsewhere to do it ( the `` let 's bury our heads in the sand and pretend women don \u00b4 t go to uk to do it '' - method ireland is using ) . 
   where or how have i suggested that rapists or murderers should n't go to jail at all ? 
  you didn \u00b4 t , and neither did i claim that you stated something like that . 
  i was simply asking a question because i found many messages from you in this thread and you seemed to have strong opinions about this/our juridical system and i was simply interested . 
   i 'm just saying that being imprisoned for several years is a serious punishment for a crime and it seems weird to trivialize it by calling it `` like nothing . '', 
  why does it matter if someone calls it like nothing ? 
  i think it is a way of expressing how horrible this crime was and a way of expressing sympathy for the victim . 
  there is a lot of people in finland too who feel like the sentences from sexual crimes are nothing like they should be ( i personally belong to this group . 
  in this particular case , not necessarily . 
  but in general just getting a _ sentence _ for your rapist is a long and rocky road , and a probation is very likely , you can rape a child and not go to prison etc ) . 
  when people claim that the money saved from this goes straight to police forces or rehabilitating the rapist or healing the victim , this isn \u00b4 t really the truth .
