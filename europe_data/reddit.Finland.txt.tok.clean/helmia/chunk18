  or that when she tried to kill herself they refused to look for the causes behind her act ? 
  or that her son ( who was abused too ) killed himself ? 
  i find it , well , typical that people with your mindset will read a newsarticle like this and the only comment you make is to make fun of feminists . 
  yeah , i think feminism is the problem here too . 
  let \u00b4 s all die of laughter thinking of those 134 women who die annually in the hands of their partners in france . 
  guess who never was in jail ? 
  her husband . 
  great that you find this situation funny . 
  her son hung himself , right ? 
  he sexually abused his daughters , right ? 
  edit : `` absolute lack of any proof '' ? 
   despite pleas from her lawyers , experts , family and friends that she acted in legitimate self-defense , because of the post-traumatic stress syndrome associated with victims of long-term domestic violence -- ** a defense not formally recognized by the french courts ** -- sauvage was condemned on appeal earlier this month in her native loire valley to ten years in prison . 
   `` thank you , '' said a neighbor who testified at the appeal trial , in comments directed towards the accused . 
  `` you have done us a service ; we can sleep easily . ''  `` our father died and for me , it was a relief , '' one of the couple 's daughters said , after sauvage went to trial for murder in 2014 . 
   a man his own daughters condemned as a `` violent , tyrannical , perverse and incestuous man . '' that woman must be practicing witchcraft , because obviously she has just manipulated all those people to her sides . 
  completely normal for a daughter to be happy your mom murdered your father , don \u00b4 t you think ? 
  just no proof , sniff . 
  you are very right . 
  i am being unreasonable . 
  i guess the endless news of our cuts is making me angry . 
  however i do n't think we should be that glad of the fact that greece is staying in the eu but has it foot out of the door , while clearly not feeling they belong . 
  grexit would n't be a catastrophe , it could be a very positive exprience . 
  they are the only ones incapable of making some kind of progress after crashing , the whole circus has been going on for way too long . 
  greece does n't really bring any value to us , just crisis after another . 
  so in that way , it would be great if they acted according their feelings . 
  i think it would benefit us and the people in greece ( if the majority really feels this way ) if they would leave . 
  edit : also i admit people ( in general ) who are unable to see their responsibility of their own problems and words like `` orthodox brotherhood '' are kind of triggering . 
   part `` they are our orthodox brothers '' i puked a little on my mouth  part `` those westerners of the eu , the nato , the usa , etc , loaded us up with denbts and it 's their fault '' oh , nato even . 
  haha . 
  no wonder you guys crashed . 
  and will crash again , because nothing will change unless you start looking in the mirror . 
   and a tiny part of `` russia will invade turkey and deliver constantinople back to us '' . 
  jesus , are you kidding ? 
  if that is so important to you , why you don \u00b4 t do it yourselves ? 
  or leave the nato for starters ( because you know , forming allies with a country you want to invade is a little weird , don \u00b4 t you think ? ), 
   russia has this weird legacy with both the `` left '' and the `` right '' in greece , that makes it pretty popular . 
  on the far left it sure has , you guys have your popular lap dog tsirpas expressing his great love towards putin . 
  but overall , just one question : all of those thing combined , what the hell are you still doing in nato/eu ? 
  just leave and practice the kind of politics you prefer . 
  then you can have orthodox brotherhood-parties in every aspect possible as much as you want . 
  so genuine question : why stay ? 
  i just can \u00b4 t stand you victim mentality . 
  that `` we are being attacked , we are justified for our hatred '' - mentality . 
  i can fully understand and accept it when someone believes that greece should n't be getting any bailout ** loans ** because `` it 's their money '' . 
  i do n't agree with it , but that probably has more to do with my country ending up with the short end of the stick . 
  loans ? 
  are you joking ? 
  i am so confused . 
  you guys actually think you are going to pay back ? 
  is that why you elected syriza and that disgusting clown `` i support russia \u00b4 s invasion in ukraine and am condemn sanctions against russia '' - tsipras ? 
  has things magically changed somehow and now you have a burning desire to pay back ? 
  we have accepted that you guys will never pay back , at least the full sum . 
  simply because it is not realistic . 
   making statements like the above , ** staying more focused on why greece should be punished for getting into trouble , while claiming you 're helping greece overcome those problems ** , is just fucked up though . 
  you know what is fucked up ? 
  you electing guys like mentioned above , nurturing a mentality of blaming `` the west '' for your problems and then cry out for them and beg to stay in eu ( fun fact : in 2015 when syriza was elected to power most of greeks still wanted to stay in eu . 
  _ while _ electing a party that is against it to power . 
  just whoa . ) . 
  telling you guys to get your shit together , look in the mirror and start fixing your problems ( caused by _ you _ . 
  not france , not finland , not estonia , not usa , whatever you want the west to be ) is `` fucked up '' to you . 
  you got into eu with lies , hided your mess for waaaaay too long , and now people are apparently hating the west , eu and even fucking nato . 
  the simple fact is you are never ever going to rise from this is you are unable to look into the mirror why you are in this situation right now . 
  and please , not some bullcrap how your crappy government is solely responsible of this . 
  your people have made an art of tax evasion . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t matter if you are an individual or a country , if someone is unable to see their own part for their problems , they will never overcome them . 
  blaming west might be comforting while you are up to your ears in shit might be a mechanism to somehow protect your sense of national pride , but at the same time it makes you look like spineless and childish . 
  i never once said that i was against the bailouts personally . 
  i was very much supporting them . 
  also , on a bigger scale , i struggle to see how you are being `` punished '' instead of helped . 
  can you please explain how ? 
  i even support forgiving them ( at least the majority of it ) , since you are simply not going to be able to pay them back . 
  and so does many eu-countries . 
  however , i personally would love it if you guys just picked up your side . 
  go through with the grexit , leave nato , drop sanctions to russia , get closer towards russia both economically and politically , whatever . 
  or then continue receiving money , be grateful for the forgiving of the bailouts when it comes ( and trust me , that day will come ) , fix your national attitude towards economy and continue in the eu . 
  that kind of weird ass-kissing on both sides whit not real stand is just gross . 
  edit : oh , and btw , it is `` your money '' . 
  finland has send like what , 4 billion by this point ? 
  but great that you guys apparently think it costs nothing for us . 
  apparently it is not even our money , since you put it in apostrophes . 
  apparently it came from somewhere else than our taxes . 
  we surely couldn \u00b4 t have done anything with that money ourselves . 
  like now we are doing major cuts to everything , also in university education . 
  but hey , the money apparently came from a magic tree it has _ nothing _ to do with the fact that my student benefit is being cut or that my friend \u00b4 s field of study is being completely cancelled . 
  but tell me again how our attitude is bad , will you ? 
  and no , greece is not the biggest reason we are struggling right now ( see , i don \u00b4 t have an easy answer to this , but blaming greece would indeed be easy and simple ) , it is a combination of the sanctions against russia , the crashing of nokia etc. 
  but let me tell you , it didn \u00b4 t help either . 
  the experts were sure greece leaving eu would have been a catastrophe back then , but now , it seems like it was the better choice . 
  then stop receiving money from her ( or the rst of us ) . 
  problem solved . 
  biting the hand that feeds you is pretty pathetic . 
  maybe you guys should start concentrating solving the problems you have caused yourself and stop pointing fingers at others who try to save you . 
  hahaa shots fired !, 
  but yeah wtf greece ? 
   the capital of scandinavia according to who ? 
  having a really crappy morning but this made me giggle . 
  thanks . 
  no you idiots he is trying to communicate with us !, 
  yes mister danish i am great . 
  how are _ you _ doing today ?
