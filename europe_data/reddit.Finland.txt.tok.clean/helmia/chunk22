  i would be completely useless . 
  good thing you are planning otherwise . 
  well that would be a pretty short bucketlist , since it is pretty possible that would turn out to be the last part of your bucketlist . 
  exactly . 
  when your mentality has gone that far , you are no different from any muslim terrorist . 
  they kill unbelievers , you think it is right to kill people who are on the left . 
  this is fucking scary to read suggestions this would be any kind of less a terrorist attack that what happened last week in france . 
  i really hope the survivors don \u00b4 t read these . 
  they have been through way too much already . 
  i can \u00b4 t believe what i just read . 
  did i really just open a thread about breivik and find the most liked comment to be `` wonder how different public opinion would be if he did it today '' ? 
  yup , seems like i just did . 
  a question about if people would `` feel differently '' about a man who first blew up 8 people , critically injuring 30 in the city center , then going to an island full of young 14-18-year old kids ( many of his victims weren \u00b4 t even old enough to _ vote _ ) , brutally slaughtering 69 , injuring and traumatizing for life even more ? 
  hmm , i don \u00b4 t know why the public would feel differently about the mass murder of innocent people ? 
  was your point was that because they were on the left ( you know , as kids who are so young that their political views are highly influenced by what their friends think and will probably change their views many times even before being old enough to vote , or how about those completely random strangers that lost their life in the city center ? ), 
  that makes it less dramatic or sad ? 
  even justified , perhaps ? 
  you do know that breivik started on the internet , browsing hateful sites to build up his anger for a long , long time before actually taking action ? 
  long enough to completely dehumanize people who have wrong political opinions in his eyes . 
  and here you are , doing the exact same thing , being supported by many . 
  funniest thing is you both think you are concerned about the `` collapsing of the west '' . 
  you know what is the most european and western value there possibly could be ? 
  to respect and defend people \u00b4 s right to have different kind of political opinions , even when they are completely against yours ( or especially then ) . 
  i think we have had enough wars on that matter . ', 
   his written manifesto would definitely garner a lot more attention than it did back then . 
  ffs . 
  his written manifesto is rambling of a lunatic person . 
  it shouldn \u00b4 t and wouldn \u00b4 t be published , and not a single sane person would read it . 
  i really hope i understand your point wrong . 
  if i do , please explain what you meant . 
   the driver 's window was open and franck , who was standing on the step , said he used it to pull himself into the truck , where he found himself face-to-face with bouhlel . 
  yes , he _ ran _ after the truck and got in . 
  because of him the truck slowed down and the police was able to shoot the terrorist . 
  i just have hard time understanding how someone can be this brave . 
  most people ( like myself ) just freeze and panic and hope someone would rescue them . 
  it would be really interesting to know what makes some people not only act but be completely fearless . 
  he even wasn \u00b4 t a police or in army or whatever , he just act on his instincts . 
   `` i hit him again and again . 
  i used my left hand with all my force , even though i 'm right-handed . 
  i punched him in the face . 
  he did n't say a word . 
  he did n't flinch , '' franck said . 
  yes . 
  can you believe this guy ? 
  i am so happy too . 
  i tried to look information about him and was so relieved when i found this . 
  amazing hero , truly outstanding human being . 
   ~ ~ ira ~ ~ ireland makes some ~ ~ pretty ~ ~ good music . 
  ftfy . 
  unfortunately americans are not the only ones thinking like this . 
  terrorism is affecting the tourism of many countries ( especially north africa , turkey etc ) but it has hit france ( link in french ) [ http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/07/01/sept-consequences-du-terrorisme-sur-le-tourisme-mondial_4962238_4355770.html] too , especially paris . 
  there has been -56 % less of japanese and -35 % of russians . 
  overall there has been like a 11 % drop in tourists arriving in paris ( this is not in the article ) . 
  this is really , really sad . 
  nice is the second most popular destination after paris , i don \u00b4 t know the percentage of tourism in it \u00b4 s economy ( meaning nice ) , but it must be very , very high . 
  france is the most popular tourist destination is the world , it is critically important for them , this shouldn \u00b4 t be happening . 
  they are being punished of the actions of these human scums , something they really don \u00b4 t have control over . 
  nice is probably one of the best places in the world to spend your holiday . 
  personally for me it is , it is hands down one of my favorite cities in the world , it has everything you can hope for a holiday . 
  them to suffer because of this is just unbearable . 
  this is exactly what should be happening , but it is . 
  it already have . 
  we should fight this ( meaning the feeling that terrorism and violence feel `` normal '' because the shock reaction doesn \u00b4 t happen anymore ) . 
  when we start to get used to this , we start accepting it as a norm and start acting accordingly . 
  also if these attacks don \u00b4 t raise strong emotions , the possibility of fighting back lowers . 
  i understand what you mean thought , i get your point . 
  i hope i got mine through . 
  i am shaken and drunk , so possibly not the best time to write in reddit . 
   never . 
  israel is actually defending itself . 
  and what makes you think france isn \u00b4 t defending itself ? 
  you know , one can \u00b4 t help but get an impression you are trying to give an impression that if france had `` defended itself '' this wouldn \u00b4 t have happened ( and therefore blaming them ) , and it is somehow a reason of their weakness or something else equally stupid . 
  you are not stupid . 
  you know perfectly well this isn \u00b4 t a simple case where you can `` stop being soft '' or whatever , this isn \u00b4 t a case where france can just bomb the s * it out of another country or stop accepting refugees or whatever , this is a very complex , homegrown radicalization . 
  that psychopath wasn \u00b4 t a jihad suspect , this was a complete surprise . 
  well to everyone else , but you , of course . 
  what do you even mean with `` defending '' ? 
  can you please explain ? 
  they are mourning . 
  this is a huge tragedy . 
  please save your `` witty '' remarks and super funny-and-original `` hehe the french are cowards '' - jokes for some other time , and have some respect ffs . 
  very well written . 
  i wouldn \u00b4 t mind . 
  kinda like children start to undress in public . 
  or wherever they happen to be . 
  just no reason , just felt like it and it seemed like a fun idea . 
  then you want to do it to rebel against your embarrassed mum who tries to stop you to show her and it becomes a battle of the wills . 
  others may not react to it like you wanted , then you cry and throw a tantrum and are surprised it did n't work out how it should . 
  you sir , you understand how this world works . 
  well done . 
  edit : you know what would be a pretty mindblowingly enjoyable experience ? 
  listen to him commentate a canada-finland hockey match . 
  i know , it \u00b4 s like wrapping yourself into a blanket made of comfort while you listen to him . 
  i thought i couldn \u00b4 t love him more , but nope , then this interview came along to prove me wrong . 
  mom : `` he thought he was leaving to some good , but once he was out there , he could never come back . '', 
  `` what do you mean he was going to do some good ? '', 
  `` humanitarian work , helping the poor syrians . '', 
  o.o sure . 
  humanitarian work , i am sure that was his main concern . 
  but ...
