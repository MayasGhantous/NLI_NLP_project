  but that would mean . . more foreigners . 
  so that can \u00b4 t be possible , because the whole idea was the get dirty non-british paws away from the precious surface of glorious great britain . 
   just randomly writes some words hoping for the best my entire reddit history in a nutshell . 
  how do you know the random internet comments are not made by heads of the states ? 
  it could be merkel trolling about the post-brexit chaos by posting gloating memes on reddit and we wouldn \u00b4 t know the difference :d, 
  mutsis on . 
   bye troll , blocking you . 
   however , `` torkea raiskaus '' has a minimum of 2 years jail time . 
  i do n't know why that one case was n't 2 years , maybe the story was mistaken or misleading ? 
  ~ ~ nope . 
  it can be a probation too . ~ ~ it very rarely is , but for ex . 
  in [ 2012 there were 18 cases of that were probations ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2016012821031793_uu.shtml ) i don \u00b4 t know if this has changed . 
  usually it is , but one needs to remember getting a t\u00f6rke\u00e4 raiskaus sentence is very rarely used . 
   as for releasing the perpetrator 's name , i believe the rule is that it will be released if the sentence is at least 2 years . 
  yes ? 
  that \u00b4 s what i wrote ? 
  your first claim was `` media will also release the full names of the perpetrators if they are convinced '' and i corrected this . 
  i am confused . 
  why are you going over this a second time ? 
   in pedophile cases it is almost never released because often the victims were relatives and easily identified . 
  yes , and i agree with this . 
  your claim , however , was that the _ only _ time the rapist \u00b4 s names are not published is this . 
   do you really believe that they are allowed back in the team after this ? 
  what does it matter what i believe ? 
  they will be going back to cuba . 
  i have no what kind of policies they have there or what kind of rules they have for professional athletes . 
  i don \u00b4 t know . 
  the source you got your information from ? 
  i was just wondering where you get yours from since iltalehti is a `` really ? 
  '' - case for you . 
  since that is where quite a lot of people get their facts that since become `` well known '' . 
   the victims get no benefit from a longer sentence other than maybe the feeling of revenge . 
  there 's a different between justice and revenge and i think a lot of people in this thread are missing it . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t matter if you are a survivor or not , you can \u00b4 t speak for others , and certainly not all victims . 
  you have zero right to shame any victim who would want a harsher sentence , and certainly not patronize how you know what is best for them . 
  also , three years is a fucking long sentence in finland . 
  i would like to see you explain another survivor whose rapist got a probation that there is a big difference between justice and revenge ( which , apparently , you know perfectly well , better than others ) and she would get nothing but a feeling of revenge from a ~ ~ longer ~ ~ actual sentence . 
   it just makes vengeful people feel like they got justice . 
  would you like to explain your theory to the [ lawyer of tukinainen ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1435111732673 ) who sees in her work how the victims don \u00b4 t want to report to the police because they don \u00b4 t feel the short sentences are worth it ? 
  i find it funny you are speaking of finnish juridic system and your examples are from three years to 30 , since much more realistic would be from a probation to three years , three years being a long sentence for rape . 
  is there in your opinion any difference between a for ex . 
  three year sentence ( basically 1,5 years , if it is a first timer ) and a probation to how the victim would feel about the sentence , how the rapist feels about what he did , or maybe a sign if what he did is grave or not ? 
  do you consider a probation as enough justice or is more than that just revenge ? 
   there 's a difference between some idiot teenager annoying a girl until she half-consents because she feels uncomfortable and wants him to stop and a grown man who violently goes after young girls . 
  i find this disturbing . 
  why do you feel the need to underrate one rape to get your point across ? 
  and also what the fuck is a a `` half-consent '' ? 
  okay , i didn \u00b4 t know that . 
   it is amazing , indeed !, 
   this is simply not true , or at least , has n't been true in several years . 
  rape ( which is more severe than sexual assault ) is jail time , every time , does n't matter if it 's the first time doing it .

  around 40 % of rapes are convicted as probations . 
  i would love to have your source for that information , since you seem extremely sure about it . 
  but last time i checked , we are at 2016 now . 
  maybe you consider these to be `` several years ago '' . 
  oh and btw , even t\u00f6rke\u00e4 raiskaus doesn \u00b4 t mean automatically jail time . 
  for ex . 
  [ man raped and cut woman \u00b4 s breasts with a utility knife , 1,10 years of probation ] ( http://www.aamulehti.fi/kotimaa/nainen-ei-suostunut-seksiin-mies-viilsi-mattoveitsella-rintoihin-ja-raiskasi/?utm_source=leiki&amp;utm_medium=iltalehti&amp;utm_campaign=kontekstuaalinen&amp;_ga=1.151820025.1334199953.1454597515 ) it usually does , but not necessarily . 
  also t\u00f6rke\u00e4 raiskaus is rarely used . 
   media will also release the full names of the perpetrators if they are convinced - ** only case where they do not is if that might jeopardize the victim . 
  ** first of all , the majority of rape cases are not reported in the media . 
  second , no , it is not a rule . 
  check out the news i just linked and count how many names you found . 
  it is true that the names are sometimes published , usually in cases where there the rapist gots more than two years of jailtime . 
  but your claim of `` only case they don \u00b4 t it is to protect the victim '' is laughable and not true . 
   these men are going to jail for 2 years or more and their volleyball careers are over if convicted . 
  wait , how do you know if their careers are over or not ? 
  that is not something we can sentence . 
  first , we don \u00b4 t know if these men are guilty or not . 
  if they are and go to court ( again , something that is not granted in finland ) and are convicted , i really hope you are right and i am wrong , and this might be the case . 
  i do admit i don \u00b4 t have as cool , objective point of view i should when talking about these , and i am not an expert . 
  i am biased , it is true . 
  i can \u00b4 t help it . 
  let \u00b4 s see and wait for the news ( which , btw , haven \u00b4 t been handled the best way in all cases . 
  for ex . 
  iltalehti didn \u00b4 t disable their comment section , and the first and most liked comment is how `` it wouldn \u00b4 t be strange for a finnish woman to want to experience with many cuban atheletes , the more the merrier '' etc ) . 
  and if i can politely point out , in the future , you might want to at least provide some kind of source when you claim an another person \u00b4 s experiences are `` simply not true . '', 
  edit : i forgot to mention that at least the victim has the media giving a kick to the case . 
  when something is widely published , it is always handled quicker . 
  she won \u00b4 t have to wait for two years to have a court date . 
  what was your source ? 
  please link it . 
  i hope it is not something like wikipedia . 
  originally he was intended to be released http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015042419573730_uu.shtml, 
  can we talk about the `` chant '' they do ? 
  can someone watch them clapping their hands perfectly in sync without goosebumps ? 
  it is amazing , like viking getting hyped up before war . 
  just woah edit : that `` hu '' is fucking magical, 
  what the actual fuck did i just read ? 
  can you please provide me the source you have for this ? 
  one true gem of finnish juridical system worth mentioning is the case of mr. hussein . 
  first , he raped at knifepoint a 13-year-old girl in 1993 . 
  he got 2 years , 10 months . 
  he was released in the fall of 1995 . 
  it took him two months to rape , murder and mutilated a 15-year old girl . 
  he was released for a three hours long vacation in 2004 . 
  during this vacation , he raped a 4-year-old child . 
  he got a 1 year 3 month sentence . 
  ~ ~ he will be released this september . ~ ~ will be possibly deported , but will stay behind bars until that .
