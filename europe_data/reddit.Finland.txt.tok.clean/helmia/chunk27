  and stupid enough not to have the slightest ability to read whats propaganda and how it is working on them . 
  no , he is absolutely right . 
  this wasn \u00b4 t about `` asking opinions '' , this is a huge , enormous decision that should have been done with great concern , by people who actually _ understand and know what they are voting on _ . 
  [ you were obviously not even close to that category . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/the-british-are-frantically-googling-what-the-eu-is-hours-after-voting-to-leave-it/ ), 
   fyi , people googling about repercussions of the eu is kids who do n't know what it is kids ? 
  are you a kid ? 
  since you had to google `` which countries are in the eu '' ( which were one of the topping trends there in google , lol ) to know if finland was a part of it . 
  people like you were googling it . 
  uneducated , stupid people , who can actually go vote on something they know absolutely nothing about . 
   well i 'm sorry for forgetting you 're part of the eu , ** no-one 's perfect . 
  ** there 's no need to be angry about a simple mistake . 
  _ and i am quite knowledgeable about the eu , forgetting one thing does n't mean i know nothing . _ i 'm quite aware of how the eu works , and why britain voted to leave . 
  knowing _ what countries are in the eu _ is the most basic information you can possibly know . 
  you didn \u00b4 t `` forget '' , you didn \u00b4 t _ know _ . 
  you don \u00b4 t have to be perfect to understand that you need to search a topic even a little bit before voting . 
  you didn \u00b4 t. 
  that is something i would never , ever do . 
  and one day after voting on a ** huge ** decision , i wouldn \u00b4 t `` forget '' all the knowledge i have searched to make my decision . 
  i understand you can easily have the illusion of being educated when you are surrounded by people who make their decision purely based on their feelings ( like xenophobia , racism , bigotry and nationalism ) . 
   i wish i had n't now , with the levels of hostility from you and others on this sub . 
  yes , thank you for proving my point about voting with feelings . 
  not only you didn \u00b4 t understand the concept of eu , if you could you would change your vote because _ you received unpleasant messages after disrespecting people in reddit _ . 
   still not clear on that train of thought . 
  of course you are not , you don \u00b4 t have the slightest idea what is going on ( but you were so knowledgeable :( ) !, 
  not only are you so absurdly uneducated that you come here demanding compassion and good deals for britain the same day , you couldn \u00b4 t be even bothered to search what this means to others before doing so . 
  please do , i won \u00b4 t help you out on this one . 
  use google . 
  like you did for checking what countries belong to eu . 
  you know how to use it . 
   it 's not because britain is filled with idiots well britain is filled with people exactly like you . 
  please read your messages again and think if this statement is true . 
  i am done with you , btw . 
   you were n't part of the eu either i am just going to stop here . 
  i simply ca n't try to have a discussion with someone who does n't have the bare minimum knowledge of the subject we would be talking about . 
  just shocking . 
  i am not surprised the slightest about the result you voted or the google trends there after the election . 
  just unbelievable . 
   putting the eu ahead of the uk makes sense , although your flair says finland so i do n't know why you 'd be doing that . 
  what . 
  just . 
  what . 
   i just thought you 'd try and be graciously polite about it i suppose well _ of course _ you did . 
  because britain must get everything they want on other countries expense , and anything else is just wrong . 
  that has been your point in every single post you have written so far . 
  but well trolled , i must admit . 
  sadly too many really think the way you do . 
  just to explain to you , a little if you really are not getting it and not trolling . 
   there 's no reason for uk-european relations to be anything but amicable . 
  i just thought you 'd try and be graciously polite about it i suppose . 
  there is zero reasons to be polite , nice or consider britain \u00b4 s best . 
  i find in unbelievable it is so absurdly hard for you to understand . 
  you insulted us in every way possible . 
  there is not a single reason to start moaning for nice behavior now . 
  i understand many leave-voters really feel the way you do , and i don \u00b4 t blame you . 
  you are used to it . 
  tldr : you slapped us in the face and now are putting up a tantrum for defending ourselves . 
  maybe you might understand what is wrong in your attitude now ? 
  or maybe not , since i have a strong feeling you are trolling , and probably not even in uk . 
   that just seems petty to me . 
  you know what seems petty to me ? 
  destroying the lives of millions of people because of xenophobia and stupidity . 
  are you serious ? 
  of course i do !, 
  we are going to put eu 's best first . 
  what on earth could possibly make you think otherwise ? 
  _ why _ , just why , we would care about you anymore ? 
  haha , the whole reddit today has been full of brits crying of `` that attitude '' . 
  either a ) `` that attitude made us leave '' or b ) `` that attitude makes us thankful for the result '' . 
  just mindblowingly entitled , stupid and selfish . 
  becuse teh immugrants !!, 
  poles everywhere !!, 
  what could be worse ? 
  leave-voter : nothing !!, 
  nothing !, 
  the arrogance . 
  the arrogance and selfishness is just ... mindblowing . 
  no , it would be smart . 
  and what would be best for scotland . 
  of course you would be the losers in that scenario , which is how it is supposed the be . 
  let me guess , you voted leave ? 
  that must be very traumatic . 
  if that isn \u00b4 t oppression i don \u00b4 t know what is . 
  those bastards . 
  but in all seriousness , how fucked up is that . 
  you do ? 
  would you say listening to them gives you scotishfaction ? 
  what \u00b4 s going on in bulgaria ? 
  can someone explain that dramatic drop ? 
   why are we even bothering with gender , you want the best people on the team regardless of their gender . 
  can you tell me how do you know this not the case ? 
  your comment wouldn \u00b4 t exist . 
  that \u00b4 s the point . 
  maybe we just sent our best and they happened to be women . 
  or is there some kind of evidence this is not the case ? 
   the screenshot we see does n't give us any necessary info to argue the intentions . 
  thank you !, 
  everybody are losing their fucking minds on this . 
   if those negotiators would have been chosen because of their skills do we have some kind of proof that this is not the case ? 
  apart one tweet ?
