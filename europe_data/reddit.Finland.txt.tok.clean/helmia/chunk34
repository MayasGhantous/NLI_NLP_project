   also keep in mind that most anti swedish sentiments are due to 19th century nationalism . 
  what ? 
  oh ffs , i do n't have time for your bullshit `` oh i am not a racist , i just genuinely think [ finland would n't ( have ) survive ( d ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qj9fc/finland_declared_most_developed_nation_in_the/d4tug9g/ ) without the [ guidance of `` far superior '' ( also as seen in thread above , more progressive , educated and sophisticated ) swedes and sweden ] ( https://www.reddit.com//r/nordiccountries/comments/35u298/besides_norway_what_makes_sweden_the_best_nordic/#bottom-comments ) , think that [ finns ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31m9e5/tis_is_finland_m%c3%a4n/cq38z0o/ ) [ are ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31m9e5/tis_is_finland_m%c3%a4n/cq39wdh/ ) [ ugly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nordiccountries/comments/5mpv3j/miss_helsinki_2017/dc63nsl/ ) and happen to be obsessed about theories why finns are not nordic/not viking descent to explain their inferiority ( i am not going to even link those , i am sure you know your post history and anyone who is interested can find them just fine ) , i just happen to think they are an [ uncultured ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/3usx1z/thought_you_guys_might_like_todays_carpe_diem/cxhxpl1/ ) ugly ( btw found a respectable number of your comments saying `` this person ca n't be finnish because not ugly enough '' , not going to link those ) creatures that just ca n't be successful the way pure nordics are , that 's all . '', 
  sverige  finland , och det vet 40 % av finlands befolkning och alla icke sanfinl\u00e4ndarpolitike '' sound familiar to you ? 
  just the lovely way you dodged that question ( why was that , exactly ? 
  you do n't seem to hold back on those opinions , why suddenly you are so shy ? 
  but kudos to you for inserting the `` here '' in your comment in sake of honesty ) `` proves you wrong '' . 
  like `` yes i think all finns are ugly and inferior , but that does n't make me a racist : , ( '' i 've seen enough racism in my life to know what racism is , and it is the belief that one group of people are all ( insert negative trait here ) , that they ca n't be ( insert positive quality of here , like your lovely way of showing up to positive threads about finland how this ca n't be right ) like the superior ( insert group here , in your case swedes lol ) , usually explaining this inferiority with bs pseudosciense about genetic differences ( in your case , your strange obession about finns not being nordic or viking ) . 
  the best kind of racist are those who genuinely think oppression or colonization was for the benefit of the less superior group , because the oppressed group just need the help and intelligence of the more superior oppressor . 
  and one does certainly not lack [ examples ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4c9l69/de_nordiska_spr%c3%a5ken/ ) in your post history about the time finland spent under swedish power . 
  so yes , my dear , you are a racist . 
  colour me surprised a racist does n't think he is racist ( because it is not racism , just the truth ! 11 !, 
  ) , that 's what you are . 
  and no i am not going to engage with you in a debate about this or search examples of your shitty attitude toward finland since i 've better things to do today . 
  i confess i am ignorant of how the conditions were to estonia during swedish times , i was referring to finland . 
  although finland certainly did have it 's fair share of hard times because of russians , but however the issue it a bit more complex since we were granted autonomy and then independence by russia . 
   care to give some examples of my so called `` pure racist '' comments ? 
  sigh , really ? 
  do i really have to do that , you are really going to play dumb ? 
  so what you are saying is that no , you do n't enjoy making comments about how finnish people look and how we are inferior ? 
  what , this kind of opportunity for your theories about finnish inferiority ( you know , vikings , skull shape , all that good stuff you enjoy ) and only one lazy youtube-link with a person with issues ? 
  are you okay ? 
  just so you know , u/tszemix is n't kidding here . 
  this is far from being the only comment how finns look , he has dedicated a good share of his redditing to explain why finns are inferior ( physically , genetically , mentally , that we are non-nordic , you name it , all that jazz ) and especially concentrating on why finns are so ugly . 
  btw that makes you wonder since i 've seen quite many comments from him that are pure racism , but still he is allowed both here in r/europe and r/sweden and both subreddits apparently are against racism ( and trolls ) . 
  you know , that kind of dude who explain why there still is the `` you are so pretty for a finnish girl '' - group of people and what kind of mentality was needed for eugenics to be popular for so long in sweden . 
  yes , so good . 
   you would get a far warmer welcome here than you would in almost anywhere else in the world . 
  in what countries you have lived during your life ? 
  you know , just to understand better where did you get that . 
  it must be a long list . 
   there 's a reason why the uk continues to be one of the most popular choices for those moving abroad . 
  yes , the language . 
  just like australia , canada and usa are popular . 
  and you can put your head on the bushes and pretend your country is `` the most welcoming in the world '' , but brexit actually really has changed things , and i can thank brexit for receiving a few of my ( highly educated ) loved ones back home . 
  getting called a polish whore and people refusing to rent their apartment for or hanging up after you tell you are from finland funnily does that . 
  and yes as a native brit ( with no doubt surrounded by leave-voters ) i am sure you can dismiss their feelings of wanting to leave because they did n't feel welcomed , but that 's what 's happening . 
  just like those nurses , they have options . 
  i would have understood your attitude before brexit , but your country ( and i am guessing you did too ) literally just voted to leave just because they hate foreigners ( please spare the bullshit rhetoric of `` muh sovereignty '' explanations here ) . 
  also the fact that your most popular medias are blatantly racist ( and xenophobic and misogynist ) and really do blame the immigrants for _ everything _ is not something that is completely disconnected from the rest of the country . 
  one of the biggest reasons you voted to leave is because your country 's extremely popular trash media has devoted their existence to fuel hatred against the eu and people from other countries , and surprisingly they all just happened to more than support brexit . 
  those medias are accepted and supported ( daily mail and the sun being the most popular newspapers in the country , hello ) , since they would go belly up if people would refuse to buy them . 
  to be able to explain that away is quite astonishing . 
  heard both ( or do n't know if it was northside ) , liked both , i even find the cork one strangely charming . 
  do n't you dare kink shame me . 
  i really enjoy listening to her , the accent makes it even better . 
   overall i just admire her . 
  i disagree . 
  this is going to bite him in the ass , definitely not a smart move . 
  this and the comments about algeria were a mistake . 
  alrighty then . 
  seriously this whole thing of turkey being batshit insane is starting to get a bit old . 
  not funny anymore and even the shock factor is n't there anymore since no one takes them seriously . 
  is this triggering in the same way than those americans who present themselves as irish ? 
  instead of guns and violence your weapon of choice to conquer the world is fertility . 
  literally make love not war with you guys . 
  because irish men are gorgeous with the most lovely accents on this planet so they influence people easily , is my strictly scientific guess . 
   equality means both genders having the same rights and be treated equally.not ignoring the perceived privileged gender 's issues . 
  i am sorry , but there is no equality in bringing children to the world , nor it is a `` gender 's issue '' . 
  for you it will take you to cum , for me it will be 9 months of pregnancy , childbirth , breastfeeding . 
  it will affect literally every part of my body , i can get severely injured ( and yes , even die ) in birth and the hormonal changes will be enormous . 
  this  since pregnancy is taxing on the body . 
  is the understatement of the year . 
  it is either a woman 's choice or then we will force women to carry children , give birth to them and give them away to their fathers . 
  this `` case by case '' scenario would mean women would completely lose the power over their bodies when they become pregnant . 
  i do n't think you understand at all what you are proposing . 
  i would love it if having kids would be a completely equal thing , just like i would love to be as strong as men or still have the option of having kids at 60 , but unfortunately i ca n't . 
  biology is n't something we can negotiate . 
  so unless you find a way to make men pregnant or both at the same time for one baby , this is never going to work . 
   the child is as his as hers . 
  takes two to tango . 
  unfortunately this seems to be forgotten whenever talking about abortion ( especially on punishing or demonizing women who have them ) so it is nice of you to bring it up . 
  it indeed is the responsibility of them both since conceiving takes two , but after that it is the woman 's job i am afraid . 
  i was just coming to say the exact same thing !, 
  seriously what a tremendous amount of work s/he had put into this , simply amazing . 
  i am really grateful too . 
  5/5 would follow these elections again . 
  can someone eli5 the weed thing for an ignorant girl ? 
  of course we care !, 
  \u2764 wonderful results , thank you netherlands !!, 
  hihi cute :d, 
  because the dutch are smart . 
  oh damn true that 's pretty cool ... 
  but hey , did you get a _ free candy _ when you voted ? 
  yeah , did n't think so . 
  boom . 
  it 's front page news at least in finland . 
   we also have our own dutch election party here right now ( tbh just an excuse to get drunk ) . 
  oh and happy cake day !, 
  it 's wonderful . 
  im really proud whenever i see people respecting something as precious as the right to vote . 
  i am going to be honest , i was nervous that a voting rate this high will predict the rise of populist parties ( it usually seems to do it ) , but still it is somehow warming to see people vote so eagerly , it kinda is the most important thing no matter how what result you are hoping for . 
  nothing in this world is more annoying than people complaining and being displeased about the way things are but still failing to use their vote . 
  but in fairness do n't you guys have really hard hours to vote and that people are not able to get off from work and so on ? 
  in finland voting happens on sundays since we want everyone to be able to participate . 
  ahem , as always , superior finland has a better solution . 
  we just write the number on the paper , like normal civilized people , instead of forcing people to battle with enormous pieces of paper , desperately looking for the right box to tick . 
  not to mention what kind of pain in the ass it must be trying to fold that ballot back . 
  poor dutchies . 
  just a hint , if you guys want to improve your system sometime in the future .
