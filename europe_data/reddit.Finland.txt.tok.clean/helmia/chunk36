  for example if you wish to have an iud , it will cost much less in a health center than in a private clinic . 
  if you ca n't afford you contraceptives , the government will pay for it . 
  many of my friend 's received their first pills for free when they visited the contraceptive counselor . 
  needless to say we have good sexual health education in schools and if you ever wish to speak with someone asap , just go visit your school nurse . 
  if you wish to seek information and learn about your options online , it took me about 2 minutes to find all the options available in my home town and even less for information on different methods in finnish . 
  when i first needed birth control , i knew perfectly well i needed to go to the my nearest health center to get my prescription and had zero problems or trouble receiving it . 
  i do n't know if this is about the fact you ca n't get hormonal contraception over-the-counter in finland , but personally i much preferred to sit down with a professional and go through with the options with care and ask all the questions i had in mind . 
  birth control pills are not candy and especially for teenagers it is important they really understand how it works , also it is good to check everything is okay in your body and if you are compatible with pills before starting them ( like my friend whose doctor recommended an iud because she had migraines and apparently those put you in a greater risk of a blood clot ) . 
  however i am sure over-the-counter contraception has it own benefits , so i do n't have that much of a firm opinion about if our way is the best . 
  what comes to condoms , they are available at every grocery store possible . 
  i do n't what 's this is about , but as a young woman in finland i 've never personally had any kind of trouble accessing contraceptives , nor have i ever heard in my life of someone who could n't have/afford contraception even if they wanted to . 
  just the idea of that is shocking . 
  and believe me , i have discussed these things more than enough with a lot of women my age . 
  sorry for the typos and if long wall of text is confusing , on my phone on a public place with a lot of distractions while writing this :d edit : also plan bs are over-the-counter and around 15 euros in pharmacies . 
  thanks dude , til !, 
  ( : is gelukkige verjaardag more informal , like how friends congratulate each other or what ? 
  it was the first one to come when i googled and i was wondering . 
  i feel terrible for people like you forced to live with this kind of crap . 
  stay strong my friend . 
  tbh it kinda does n't . 
  i would like to think we have evolved as a specie and that the current peace and stability will continue in europe . 
  when someone ( and his supporters ) are this brain dead , it makes them extremely unpredictable . 
  you ca n't expect rational behavior and calm decisions from people like this , it creates an easily inflammable environment where things go from 0 to 100 in a second . 
  i 'm not saying this particular situation will cause some real trouble , it is just so uncomfortable to be reminded that we are not dealing with a sane leader or country here and how bad things really are in turkey . 
  i just hope he calms down after a while . 
  the whole thing is ridiculous . 
  ~ ~ gelukkige verjaardag to your brother ( did i get it right ? 
   i know it must be hard to put a happy face on and try to celebrate in a such a collapsed , poor , fascism-torn country , but i hope you nazis made the best of it !, 
  this is just ... 
  this is just beyond parody at this point . 
  this is not even funny anymore . 
  the oranges , the wrong flag , saying the _ dutch _ are nazis , not to mention the whole fucking thing to begin with . 
  i just ... 
  i do n't even know what to say . 
  stop the train , i want off , i do n't feel safe anymore . 
  they are so incredibly stupid that it is seriously frightening . 
  people this simple can be extremely dangerous . 
  i would like to take a moment to remind everyone that glorious finland scored [ 100 ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/finland ) . 
  not [ 99 ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/netherlands ) like fascist nazi-dutchies . 
  [ okay , you may now continue . 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/l4lrteglr5fgi6rxw/source.gif ) but seriously , love you guys and respect how well and firmly you 've handled the situation . 
  i am really sorry you had to be the first ones to set boundaries to a 63-year-old mantoddler and especially on having to deal with the temper tantrum following that shock , but i guess we all have to go through that growing pain in our lives at some point ( some earlier , like my 1,5 year old cousin who flips his shit and tries to eat the curtains when he is n't allowed to wear pyjamas to -3 degrees , some later like the president leading a country of 79 million people who completely shits himself with rage when he is respectfully asked to follow the reasonable rules of a sovereign nation ) . 
  i guess we just have to wait and see how long it takes for him to put his big boy pants on and recover from this severe emotional trauma . 
  meanwhile i would really really like to see our leaders get behind the netherlands and speed the process of putting him on his place . 
  i have a feeling dad took it well . 
  he seems like a someone who has humour , 
  this is seriously the cutest thing i 've ever seen . 
  my friend showed me this and we laughed till tears . 
  everything from how the girl struts in like `` sup dad , i 'm here to ruin your career '' to how the baby persistently wobbles after her big sister is just heart breakingly cute and funny the same time . 
  it 's so adorable to see how daddy breaks out of his career person to a normal human dad . 
  :d i feel bad for the wife , but i hope she is n't too hard on herself . 
  kids can be a handful sometimes , just last week i was watching my friends kids and oh my god they were everywhere ... 
  i missed them the second they fell asleep though :d, 
  sorry , it did n't occur to me someone could take this seriously . 
  what do you think ? 
  yes . 
  yup i realized my mistake . 
  thanks for the super helpful links ( and other information ) though , this is completely new information . 
  i am glad you took your time to educate me . 
   and by the way , then around 1854 , the republican party was the one to oppose slavery , whereas democrats supported slavery . 
  ** you may want to paint the republicans as universally bad guys , ** but the real history is more complicated than that . 
  sigh . 
  oh damn , of course . 
  what an embarrassing brain fart . 
   because you said those . 
  i just . . 
  i just keep making it worse . 
  i am going to stop now . 
  ( it was a bad joke btw ) . 
   does n't sound too bad . 
  moomins is never a bad idea . 
   new jersey and some other states granted universal suffrage in 1776 ,  a notable aspect of this original 1776 new jersey state constitution is that it provisioned suffrage to citizens without regard to gender or race . 
  new jersey stood alone among the original thirteen states of the revolutionary period in excluding these distinctions . 
  as set out in its defining constitutional document , only three provisos restricted those claiming the vote : ( i ) being of `` full age '' , ( ii ) ** having attained a threshold level of wealth ** , and ( iii ) having residence within a county during the year prior to an election . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_new_jersey_state_constitution#vote_not_limited_by_race_or_gender however very interesting , i did n't know that . 
   too bad they backed out of it . 
   ca n't allow you to go around insulting danes with bad grammar . 
  how do you not know i mean the singular danish king-whatever-ruler-dude who was in charge ? 
  maybe if your language were more useful and interesting we would have spent the swedish lessons doing something else than watching moomins . 
  : / but yeah i should n't have made that mistake . 
  i could blame being liberated from swedish in my childhood and writing on my phone in a difficult place , but i wont since i will be doing that again in a while . 
  those j\u00e4vl\u00e4 danskj\u00e4vel ... 
  but seriously i did n't find enough information with a quick googling but i am super interested and would love to hear from an icelander , what happened before 1915 ? 
  was it the danish who put the strangely high age limit of 40 for women or what 's the story behind that ? 
  why denmark decided to block it ? 
  because finland , dude . 
  emotionless look is how we roll . 
  but in all seriousness , i once wondered that myself too to my grandmother and she said that pictures were such an extremely rare occasion that everyone were a bit nervous and something like it how it was n't considered appropriate to smile in pictures even at her youth . 
  since there is confusion about the title , i guess i could try to clarify that a bit . 
  feel free to correct me if anything goes wrong . 
   finland was the first country in the world to grant truly ** universal suffrage ** for both men and women . 
  in new zealand women were n't eligible to stand as candidates until 1919 , in australia the true universal suffrage ( regardless of race ) was n't achieved until 1962 . 
  that meant both finnish men and women ( over 24 ) , no matter of their race , education , wealth , marital status etc. 
  were able to vote and to run for office . 
  the world 's first female members of parliament were elected in 1907 . 
  so i guess the title can be seen as a bit misleading , since the kiwi women had the right to _ vote _ earlier , and i am not that sure how things went in australian regions ( was it truly universal for everyone regardless of race ) , but technically i think we could say finland was the third to give women the right to vote but the first to grant truly universal suffrage . 
   south australia definitely beat finland in giving universal suffrage in 1894 i thought australia did n't grant universal suffrage until 1962 ? 
  was this regardless of race ? 
   i feel ashamed of myself . 
  i see you have embraced our national mindset , integration completed .
