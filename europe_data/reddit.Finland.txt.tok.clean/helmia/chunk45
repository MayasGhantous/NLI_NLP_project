  and the issue is much more complex than that . 
  you could say that considering that 95 % of the population is learning a language for 5 % of the people . 
  however , those are not a swedish minority , they are just as finnish as everyone else , just swedish-speaking finns . 
  your comment is really strange . 
   sweden : demonized for poor integration of current immigrants while simultaneously being demonized for too good integration of former immigrants . 
  maybe you should try to see things past your victim-complex and realize that prohibiting someone speaking their own language is not '' too good integration '' or then you have a really strange view of integration . 
  this is n't about those kids refusing to learn/not knowing how to speak swedish or not integrating ( and what a hard integration it is , since the cultural differences are just soo massive ) to the swedish society , you know that . 
   most `` finns '' in sweden speaks swedish only and are virtually indistinguishable from the ethnic swedish majority in everything but surnames . 
  the substantial minority ( 250 000 or so ) that do speak some finnish are often older i do n't understand what you are trying to say here . 
  so apparently this problem should n't exist since the younger generation does n't want to speak finnish ? 
  and yet here they are complaining about it . 
  or is your point that once you 've moved/your ( grand ) parents have moved to sweden you no longer have the need to speak/learn finnish ( and apparently you become a `` finn '' instead of being a finn ) ? 
  why exactly is that ? 
  let 's face it , the oppression and swedish disregard towards the finnish language is nothing new , quite the opposite . 
  it has a long history from the time we were under your power ( finnish was considered to be a dirty forest-language so you could n't use your native language in any kind of formal situation ) and it never stopped after it . 
  i have read way too many stories about how the children of immigrants or the kids who were sent there during the war were taught to be ashamed of their own language and never speak it on school . 
  this attitude has its roots on racism and nothing else . 
  these are not some isolated coincidences of people feeling like they are shamed for speaking their own language , i mean uppsala _ forbid _ people speaking finnish at their workplace back in 2007 ffs . 
  this is just as unacceptable as if sweden would try to silence people speaking french , english , german or whatever else language with each other . 
  ** edit ** : i have to add something because i 've dealt with this shit like this my whole life and it always upsets me . 
  immigrating somewhere does n't magically remove your history , language and the culture you grew up , nor should no one suggest that it should be that way . 
  if you immigrated , would you lose your swedishness ? 
  not only it is completely impossible since things like that are a huge part of your identity , but asking that is always declining that person 's heritage and implying yours is superior . 
  that _ does n't _ mean that you should n't integrate , adapt to the culture , obey the laws , basically live your life exactly as the natives live it . 
  if the culture you left from is in conflict with the country you are currently living , you of course go with the latter one . 
  you can even identify firstly as the citizen of that country you moved to ( putting it in a clumsy language , meaning that your `` loyalty '' goes to that country ) , and very likely at least your kids growing up in that country will feel that way . 
  but things that harm no one like speaking your native language at home or with your friends should n't be a problem to anyone , quite the contrary , different languages are a richness . 
  that is n't in any shape or form in conflict with the fact that you must learn the language of your current country . 
  your native language is the language of your heart , nothing can ever replace it . 
  people would lose a crucial connection with their kids if they never taught their own language to their kids and the people suggesting that would be a good idea simply do n't understand what they are asking . 
  even the `` well meaning '' people wanting to express how you are completely accepted as one of them going `` but you are 100 % ( nationality here ) now , now you do n't have to speak ( your native language here ) or do this or that custom '' are really just saying how you are finally in civilized culture , you can now drop those lesser things . 
  humans are intelligent creatures with the capacity to quite complicated thinking , and something as abstract as your national identity can be much more complex than just one country and that ' it . 
  for example my mother is the most finnish person i know , but at the same time she is someone who first put her foot on finnish soil when she was already an adult and does n't have a drop of finnish blood in her , but at the same time she is someone who immediately switches to her own language while she gets angry or emotional with me . 
  a finnish immigrant or child of a finnish immigrant can be completely swedish , feel swedish and look like a swede while still speaking finnish and having finnish ethnicity ( in other words being a finn instead of being a `` finn '' ) . 
  i know i can be finnish and feel finnish , while still having a connection to another country , having half of my genes being different from the rest of the country and speak another language as my second native language . 
  a polish person can immigrate to the uk and still feel polish for the rest of his or her life while still being and acting british . 
  it 's not that hard . 
  haha thanks for pointing out the typo , i edited it, 
  more people = more social contact . 
  damn you dutchies , damn you and your beautiful country that makes people want to move there and/or pop babies out . 
   the spanish soldiers are the best of the history of europe i thought france has won the most wars ? 
  so maybe it is french soldiers who are the best . 
  eh , nothing : , d just being honest here , i seriously do n't know anything about belarus . 
  i have an image that they are russia 's biggest bitch though . 
  edit : no wait phoebe 's boyfriend left to work in minsk . 
  so i know that their capital is minsk . 
  argh the amount of upvotes you have drives me crazy . 
  seriously why there does n't exist a middle ground between you guys and the embarassing sweden-bashers ? 
  i guess if i have to pick one it is you , but still , damn . 
  learn what actually happened instead of filling the blank spaces with some kind of strange idolized picture you have . 
   unified defense ? 
  check . 
  wtf are you checking there ? 
  since we _ do n't _ have an unified defense with sweden . 
  if the war would break out right now we would be just as alone as we were back in 1939 and it drives me nuts that finns have some kind of illusion that sweden would be our closest partner if shit went down since they 've done nothing for us to rely on that and i do n't get it where people like you get that idea . 
  they have refused to give us safety guarantees , one of their biggest parties has very clearly stated that sweden will go to nato if they decide so and their decision will not rely on finland 's situation . 
  just because sipil\u00e4 bangs his one-sided drum on what he dreams would be true instead of talking about nato does n't make it real . 
   dragging us into the eu ? 
  check . 
  oh fuck me i am getting worked up . 
  sweden did n't `` drag us to eu '' and i would really like to hear what makes you think so . 
  sweden applying to be a member at the same time than we did was _ one _ factor influencing the process that ultimately ended in the eu membership in 1995 . 
  bigger factors were the collapse of su , the fear of unsafety it caused , the need to show how we strongly do indeed belong to the west . 
  the process started even before that back in the late 1980 when the economic partnership came to an end between our countries . 
  also the horrible depression of the early 90s and the economic relief eu promised played a big role . 
  and what comes to actual eu-referendums , finland hold our one month before sweden and we had like a 4 % bigger support in favor of joining than sweden did . 
  seriously , you should know this . 
   making it clear that finland is nordic ? 
  check . 
  hmm , please elaborate ? 
  what do you even mean with this ? 
  you mean that our economic and political model and culture are a product of sweden somehow `` making it clear '' to us ? 
  or to others ? 
  what ? 
   we managed to stay independent next to the ussr and out of nato through the whole cold war . 
  we did n't do that alone . 
  first of all , the fact that we never joined nato is ** definitely ** not a good thing . 
  we had that one small window right after the collapse of the su when russia was weak , and we fucked it up . 
  there is nothing to celebrate about it , even less seeing it as an accomplishment to thank others . 
  the reason we stayed out of nato had only a very small part to do with sweden and everything to do with the fact that the conditions for our joining was to guarantee the safety of estonia ( the people we were negotiating and discussing with were not sweden , if this comes as a surprise to you ) also us still being afraid of russia and those politicians who should 've done it feeling like the eu membership alone was too much work to combine it with nato . 
  what comes to our independence during the cold war , our situation was _ completely _ different from the one sweden had . 
  america had secretly guaranteed the safety of sweden if something would happen , we had our bald drunk diplomating his ass off to balance between the awkward and agonizing situation between the west and east . 
  the reason why it was such a hard spot was because just like during the war , we were alone with no one to rely to . 
  it is true that we managed to keep our independence during the cold war , but the biggest country we should thank about that is the su , since they simply decided not to attack . 
   the king of sweden did an interview just a few months ago where he remembered about kekkonen and how familiar they were . 
  sure , finnish and swedish politicians have close ties . 
  however , that does n't come even close to the picture you just painted . 
  i am all on board to celebrate our close ties and recognize all the good sweden has done ( and there is a lot of that kind ) , but at least let 's stick to the truth . 
  it does n't have to be rabid idiocy or blind asskissing with only one narrative . 
  however our relationship today does n't rely on what they did during ww2 or even back in the days we were under their power , it simply does n't matter . 
  suffering , misery and hard work until you die a painful death . 
  alone . 
  that is the only way , otherwise you are doing it wrong . 
  only acceptable occasional moments of joy are eating ( but nothing _ too _ delicious ) and orgasms ( only when producing babies tho ) . 
   though i get that alot of people get fully erect at the thought of fighting for nazi germany . 
  i was about to write a quite different message to you until i read your last phrase . 
  how sad to see something like that from a swede . 
  judging by the things you write i ca n't even tell if you are joking with your flair or not . 
  if you are , it 's not funny . 
  haha yup i live here !,
