  brexit is nothing but a reflect on how brits feel and what kind of people they are . 
  politics and the government is not disconnected from `` the people '' , since the regular voters shape it . 
  god damn it you rich tall bastards :(, 
  having the freedom to do that is indeed nice . 
   glad we both live in countries where women have the right to choose , so it does come to personal preferences . 
   pro-life should be the standard in all european nations , imo i am so grateful it is n't , if we had that as a standard i would n't recognize europe . 
  women dying and or having terrible injuries from unsafe abortions is not something what i consider a good standard . 
  and btw , ireland is n't abortion free , so what those people are marching for is n't that clear for me . 
  they just have outsourced it to the uk . 
  the strangest thing is that abortion is illegal ( technically you get more from abortion than from rape , for example . 
  14 years ) in ireland , but their right to travel to get one is constitutionally protected . 
  reproductive rights and women 's rights are human rights , something that europe stands for . 
  yup . 
  tens of thousands marching to keep abortion illegal . 
  their slogan is `` love both '' , the irony ... what i 've seen in snaps there is a _ lot _ people . 
  even back in 2013 when i was there i remember being overwhelmed how many people ( i remember being especially taken aback how many young dudes around my age where there ) participated , but now that the abortion referendum is coming they are really stepping their game up . 
  my first thoughts exactly . 
  i do n't really see a reason why not . 
  the world lost a legend today . 
  one of my biggest role models . 
  i have nothing but immense respect to this amazing , brave , courageous and intelligent woman . 
  she truly was an exceptional human being , someone who fought tirelessly to protect women and girls , now the fruits of her labour benefit millions of women and girls who will be always thankful for her and other women like her who put themselves on the line to protect us all . 
  she is the shining example of fighting for what is right , with elegance and brain , even when the fight can be brutal and your opponent terrifying , but i guess after the concentration camp and losing your family you fear nothing . 
  she is the symbol of how you can rise and accomplish great things in life , even after seeing unspeakable evil , she is the symbol of how women can accomplish anything we want if only we work hard enough and are fearless enough , without losing our femininity . 
  she is someone who could have easily chosen hatred , instead she chose to dedicate her life to peace , humanity and passionately working towards that dream . 
  she is the symbol of france and french society .

  haha i see your point but think about it , we are performing `` cosmetic surgery '' to infants to fix something where there is _ nothing _ wrong . 
  i think there is clearly a bad need for some praising here . 
  i mean compliments are good for your self esteem , it always makes a day better when someone reminds you you are beautiful . 
   and let 's be honest , penises just happen to be magnificent anyway . 
  it 's always nice to celebrate physical beauty . 
  thanks , i was just concerned if i was making my point clear enough . 
  yeah i was pretty stunned opening my inbox this morning . . :d glad to find out my crazy phone flipping brings joy to at least some people haha :d,

  whoops i was missing a word there , thanks for being kind enough not to point that out haha :d i edited it . 
  and yeah you are right of course , with people there always is the exception since we tend to do some weird things as a specie but nothing that would be comparable to how widely practiced circumcision is i meant to say . 
   i think adult circumcision is weirder than stretching your earlobes since you the latter does n't reduce sexual pleasure . 
   eh , that 's arguable . . foreskins look weird if you ask me :p the reason you think like that is cultural and kinda the point of why we should have a problem with the culture of preferring cut penises . 
  it 's simply of what we are used to , since there is n't any kind of biological or evolutionary reason to desire foreskin free penises . 
  it does n't impregnate you easier , it 's not a sign of fertility , nothing that would make some sense . 
  because really , humans are just so weird when you look at us . 
  like toes , those are some ugly fuckers . 
  still no one considers them weird or wants to chop them off . 
   lots of males think circumsized penises look better and a lot of girls also agree with that . 
  yeah i know that . 
  even in finland some of my finnish girlfriends are obsessed about cut penises and state they will never go back to uncut ones ( which basically means finnish dudes . . ) . 
  it is a big thing . 
  there is a lot of claims and rave around it . 
   i have no real issues with people doing it for aesthetic reasons but i generally agree that aiming to chop part of your penis off because you think it 'll be more desirable by the other sex is kind of silly . 
  your sentence is kinda funny because you do n't have a problem with it but you still think it is stupid . 
   we first have to work on making sex a less of a taboo in society , before tackling the religious aspects . 
  uh , well , that would be quite hard considering that you ca n't separate those two ( i woul n't really call it taboo though - more like obsession about sex , reproductive organs and `` purity '' ) . 
  in vast majority of male circumcisions the reasons to do it are religious . 
  how can you first make sex less of a a taboo without touching religion if religion is the source of those beliefs and practice ? 
  if you look [ at this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_circumcision#/media/file:global_map_of_male_circumcision_prevalence_by_country.svg ) there is quite a clear correlation between religion and mgm . 
  sure , there is some other reasons like cultural ( but that originally comes from a culture religion has created ) and medical , but it is clear religion is the number one reason why we mutilate little boys . 
  male circumcision is not only about `` hygiene '' as some claim , the roots of it are in punishing human sexuality , trying to make it less pleasurable and shameful . 
  religion is obsessed about controlling sex ( probably you could argue that it is its only purpose ) , and the reason for male circumcision is come from religious ideas of seeing human sexuality as dirty and sinful . 
  people are convinced that the body of an infant child is impure without cutting it . 
   we should educate young children ( without confusing them ) how the act of sex works when they 're much older . 
  just a plain , `` male penis get hard because blah blah , female vagina gets ` wet ' because blah - at this point you could insert the penis into the vagina '' . 
  i 'm not sure if i get perfectly what you mean here . 
  i of course agree that having a rational , positive outlook in human sexuality is crucial , but how can you teach that without tackling the religious aspects , if the biggest reason people are taught and believe otherwise is religion ? 
   this is n't about who 's better or worse or who 's more of a victim or not . 
  yes , to you this is n't about male circumsion . 
  it 's about feminism . 
  since to you , if i understand correctly , feminists and feminism is the key to solve this issue so it the most important thing to bring out while discussing mgm . 
   i just want justice and fairness , and the ones that have those values as their flag , seem to ignore these issues . 
  feminists do n't have a flag ( yeah i do n't care if it was a metaphor ) , just like they do n't have a holy book , clear leaders or some kind of organizations feminists actively attend . 
  the clear , vast majority who define themselves as feminists just do that and that 's it . 
  no secret group meeting with influential power people deciding stuff . 
   ** feminism is ** thankfully very present and ** influential ** in our society nowadays , they could definitely do more about this . 
  oh really . 
  : , d interesting that you say how `` feminism '' is present , but then continue saying how `` they '' could do more . 
  exactly who or what could do more ? 
  what organization ? 
  the individual feminist girl ? 
  what can she do differently than a girl who does n't consider herself as a feminists but wants to stop this ? 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_circumcision#/media/file:global_map_of_male_circumcision_prevalence_by_country.svg ) is a map of prevalence of male circumcision .
