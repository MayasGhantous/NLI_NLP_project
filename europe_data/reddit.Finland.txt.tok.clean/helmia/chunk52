  i think it was perfectly obvious that the child was thinking she will get that abortion because of her suicidal tendencies . 
  _ that _ is the story behind this , meaning how wonderfully that law works in practice . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : the same r/europe that is so outraged by muslims treating women like animals happily up votes a non-explanation for a situation where a child is forced to continue her pregnancy that clearly affects her mental health as `` protecting '' is pretty upsetting . 
  1 . the irish abortion laws are medieval , there does n't exist an excuse for them . 
  _ even _ if this was more a story about mental health , we should be concerned and outraged about them . 
  2 . the possibility of the child not being depressed or suicidal in the first place , but just forced to put on a show trying to get that abortion she needs and seeing that as the only possibility is completely possible . 
  maybe her parents simply could n't afford the trip to another country and this was the only option , and there was n't any other way for her to get one . 
  3 . there should be only one person who decides if they want to continue or end the pregnancy , and that is the pregnant girl or woman . 
  no one else can know that for them , no matter how well educated they are . 
  this was a child with very strong views about abortion and a clear need to get one . 
  she should n't have been put through this . 
  4 . when someone seeks an abortion and thinks they are travelling to get one and gets not only denied one but held against her will , that is not protecting the person . 
  it would have been different if the abortion had been performed and then held her because they feared she was suicidal . 
  5 . a doctor can and very often have a personal bias that affects their work , especially in a case like this where a doctor simply ca n't know the answer to something like if the real root of her problem is the pregnancy and how aborting would n't help he . 
  it would be incredibly naive not to consider a doctor not being able to leave their personal opinions out of their work in a situation where they have the complete power , in a catholic country where abortion is very much publicly condemned . 
  health care professional refusing to perform abortion is nothing new , one using their power to prevent one would n't be nothing new either . 
  in other words , the suicidal part life during pregnancy act would n't be anything but a cosmetic touch and in practice impossible to monitor if it is correctly respected , since it is an arbitrary decision of the doctor . 
  6 . all the crucial information , like how old she was , how long she was , _ did she get that abortion after all _ , are left out . 
  that can mean the reality is the worst possible one , being that this whole charade took so much time they could n't have traveled to uk even if they ended up finding the money . 
  or then she just was forced to her fate , since obviously she was n't getting one back in ireland , and by now ( this happened in 2016 ) we have another innocent child in the world mothered by someone who fought tooth and nail to avoid that fate , being a child herself . 
   the actual story is a pregnant child with depression was sent for professional psychiatric assessment by her doctor and when they discovered she was not in danger of self harm or suicide she was released . 
  the actual story is a ** `` very young girl '' wanting an abortion desperately and not having one . 
  she was under the impression she would get one , but ended up being held in a psychiatrist unit and _ having a doctor to decide for her she does n't need an abortion _ ** . 
  how many times i have to read these news exactly to get the point i can happily upvote your message like so many else and consider you message somehow explaining everything and making this situation something else than shocking and disgusting ? 
   the church is not involved . 
  ... why are you even saying this ? 
  is this some kind of argument ? 
  the church is very fucking much involved , since the church is the reason why your abortion laws are what they are . 
  saying that the church is `` not involved '' in something that is the direct consequence of their influence is ridiculous . 
  the church exactly is the reason why this young girl was pushed through this hell . 
  of course it is involved . 
   the medical and court system worked as they are supposed to . 
  exactly . 
  is this something you present as a softening fact ? 
  that your your inhumane laws worked exactly as they should - jeij ? 
  or did they even work properly ? 
  have you considered that the doctor messed up even in the limits of your horrible laws , and that she should have been qualified to abort because she was suicidal ? 
  but she was n't , because something like that will be completely on the power of the doctor - it is a mental condition , not physical one and therefore gives a lot of room for own personal opinions that might have nothing to do with them being professional . 
   i hate the hypocrisy of the irish legal situation where we force those to want a termination to go abroad to get one , but this case was about protecting someone who was in a difficult mental state and worked as intended . 
  ** `` this case '' was about a goddamn child wanting a fucking abortion and not getting one because an `` expert '' decided `` that it would n't solve her problems even that she was depressed and angry '' and her being locked up when she traveled there thinking that she would have the fucking abortion ** . 
  so do n't you _ dare _ say that `` this is n't about abortion '' and how you hate the `` hypocrisy '' of your laws but how they are irrelevant here . 
  first of all , your laws are not only hypocritical , they are downright cruel . 
  travelling is expensive and mentally and physically exhausting , and _ still _ it is reserved for those who can actually pay for the trip . 
  this case is about your laws . 
  without your laws , she could have gotten that abortion like anyone living one of the most progressive , developed countries in this planet earth should have gotten . 
  she would n't have been depressed _ in the first place _ , she would n't have been forced to perform her ridiculous desperate dance of visiting doctors to get the permission to abort ( do n't even say you did n't consider that this was just someone whose parent was too poor to take them to the uk and they tried to get the abortion this way ) , and she would n't have had a fucking `` expert '' deciding _ for her _ if she should have a child or not . 
  ** you are twisting a sick situation where an outside party decides for a young child who clearly does n't want to be a mother how she will be a mother as `` protecting '' and how you `` do n't see anything being wrong with it '' . 
  you can and you should keep suicidal people against their will , but being denied the abortion is n't protecting , and nor is giving people the impression they will travel to have an abortion and then be held there against her will . ** . 
  you are out of your mind if you genuinely think that doctors are n't humans and just as biased as everyone else - first , there does n't exist an education in this world where the doctor could make a decision that her aborting would n't help her depression . 
  so yes this is about abortion and not mental health , and no the activists are not being overly dramatic and making this something to it is not , since this is _ exactly _ about women 's rights and abortion rights . 
  you ca n't bullshit away the fact that there was a girl who wanted abortion and did n't get one . 
  you accept blindly the decision of `` experts '' instead of the mother herself . 
  how that can be anything else than a story about abortion and women 's rights ? 
  your every comment is whitewashing this situation and not giving a second to think how heartbreakingly terrifying the situation your country forces women is . 
  i understand it is uncomfortable when the shameful shit your country has ( because hey we all got something ) is discussed like this and you might need feel the need to make it look less shocking , but the reality is that your country 's abortion laws are a fucking nightmare and this is a text book example of it , so please do n't find excuses for it . 
  do n't try to to pretend it does n't exist , do something about it . 
   what reasons should there be for abortion , saving the mother 's life , sure , but what else ? 
  you said it yourself well , `` because they do n't want the baby '' , that one . 
  a woman knowing that she does n't want to be a mother should absolutely be enough , and it is horribly alarming that you do n't think so . 
  motherhood is the biggest decision in your life , there does n't exist anything comparable to it . 
  you can change your mind about marriage , education , job , anything , but children , those are something that are there for life and the most demanding task a human being can have . 
  it will require exactly that , will . 
  _ wanting _ to be a parent is crucial , because there does n't exist anything else that is as committing , as ungrateful , as intense , as demanding as nursing a human child to adulthood and sometimes even beyond that . 
  there world is filled with people who did n't really want kids and still got them , and you can see the effects yourself , i do n't have to start listing them . 
  `` love '' is n't enough . 
  you need money , stable conditions , very preferably a healthy stable relationship with your partner and will to build your life around them . 
  also , you not being able to think reasons tells how you do n't have a realistic clear image of how different the situations of those women who seek an abortion are . 
  there is everything from being too old to too young , too poor , having too much children already ( very common actually , but we have the image of only promiscuous young girls having abortions . 
  in fact most women in the world having abortions are married mothers ) , not wanting any children , wanting children but being in a life situation where simply it is n't possible ( like i know a woman who had an abortion because they went bankrupt and her husband got cancer at the same time and they already had 3 kids . 
  it was n't possible to have one ) , being raped , not having a proper partner to raise the child with ( i find it strange you could n't think of something that simple ) and not wanting to be single moms , not being physically , mentally , financially able to mother a child . 
  you start with an expectation all women are fit to be mothers . 
  the world is filled with women who are addicts ( drugs , alcohol , whatever ) , psychopath , cold-blooded horrible narcissistic , pedophiles , criminals , everything you can think of who should n't have children . 
   should we allow abortion due to disability ? 
  the uk does , and 90 % of downs babies are aborted . 
  absolutely . 
  i am not sure why you are singling this out . 
  a disabled child or a child with down 's syndrome are extremely demanding . 
  before you judge women and couple 's who end up aborting fetuses with abnormalities , put yourself in their position . 
  have you ever had sex ? 
  if yes , would you personally be ready to be a father to a child who is disabled , your sex partner knocking at your door right now and saying `` he is yours , this child is your life now '' ? 
  that would n't mean raising a kid to 18-20 , that would mean having a child who would never grow up for ~ 60 years ( or whatever their life expectancy nowadays is ) . 
  if your answer to this is no , then do n't push it to others either . 
  if your answer is `` but they can just put the child to adoption '' , then please , get real . 
  would you adopt a disabled child ? 
  how much takers you think disabled and children with down 's syndrome have ? 
   should we allow abortion due to the child 's sex ? 
  that leads to girls being targeted . 
  this is basically the only reason when abortion is n't allowed in finland ( however , one should note that in finland abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks and after that when there is something wrong with the mother or the child . 
  you can see the sex of the child at the ultrasound at week 20 , which is obviously much later and is n't a reason to abort , so there 's that ) . 
  it is a matter of culture where women are seen as inferior , not free abortion . 
  that leads to my next point ...  `` on request '' ( any reason ) abortions are n't allowed in the united kingdom , finland , australia , new zealand , and a whole host of countries which allow abortions in more expanded circumstances , that is in fact incorrect . 
  i ca n't speak from the other countries , but in finland abortion you can get an abortion if you are raped , the mother 's life , health or mental health is in danger , fetal abnormalities _ and socioeconomic reasons _ . 
  90 % of abortions in finland are done because of socioeconomic reasons and those can be absolutely anything ( that can be `` i need to concentrate on my hamster 's beauty pageants so i do n't want a child '' ) . 
  you have to meet a doctor before your abortion , but your doctor does n't have the right to forbid you from having an abortion , so in other words , ** you can get an abortion in finland for any reason ** and you _ will _ always get an abortion if you want one . 
   to say that abortion should be allowed for any reason , just because other countries allow it , is a bit unfair . 
  it is not `` unfair '' . 
  we should be horrified of their laws . 
  abortion being illegal , _ illegal _ is backwards and barbaric . 
  ireland 's abortion laws are a shocking exception in western countries . 
  please let this sink in : even saudi-arabia allows women to have an abortion for woman 's health .
