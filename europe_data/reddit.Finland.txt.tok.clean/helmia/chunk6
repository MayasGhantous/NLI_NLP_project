  and i am not saying this in an edgy `` thanks for the oppression bitches , our horrible revenge will be never learning your language '' - way the guy thinks we are doing it ( whoever he is , his knowledge in this particular subject is zero and i call bullshit on his `` stories '' ) but the fact that it really is . 
  you are never going to need it and when you interact with swedes , you just speak english . 
  sweden is a tiny country , your days of being the model of the wellfarestate we need to copy on everything are over , germany has already replaced your place as our top trade partner and a human has limited number on languages we can learn . 
  so it should be english , german , french , chinese , spanish , whatever that can actually benefit you . 
  of course if you are looking forward moving to sweden it is a completely different thing , but that applies to every country and language possible anyway . 
  the mandatory swedish is only a tired remain of our time swedish times , nothing more . 
  for a while after the wars it was our way of connecting and getting closer to west and further from russia . 
  nowadays it just simply does n't serve any purpose . 
  there are like 5 % of finlandsvenks and they all speak finnish anyway so yeah . . 
  if you are motivated by the fact that maybe once in your life a finlandsvenks wants to have service the in place you are working in swedish because it 's his/hers right and they enjoy annoying you , be my guest and learn it . 
  overall the language question is age old and goes way beyond the reasons this dude thinks they go . 
  because hey let 's face it , if we really would be pissed for something it would be because you guys chose to sit on your well-fed healthy asses and and even denied the help from other countries passing trough during the wars , right ? 
  hehe just kidding ... or am i ? 
  no but seriously , we do n't speak it , end of story . 
  tldr : ** we do n't speak it . 
  ** there is nothing else in it . 
  i do n't do it to payback for the things my ancestor experienced or something equally stupid , i just do n't . 
  just like i do n't speak hungarian or something , and it is not an insult that should be taken personally . 
  if you do you should pull your head out of your ass . 
  the relations are something this dude has no idea , but bottom line is that they are good and we love swedes . 
  this guy \u2764, 
  i have a feeling the comments are going to be good :d everything in this is adorable , from the fact that a competition called `` giant pumpkin european championship '' exist to how proud the guy holding the sing looks , you can see how pleased he is :d even the pumpkin is somehow super cute , but maybe im just nuts, 
  ... can someone explain what 's happening in this picture ? 
  oh my god these are _ beautiful _ . 
  just breathtakingly gorgeous , just seeing these make me feel better ... until i return to the reality and look out of the window to the cold pitch dark finnish fall : :( just decided i need to go to menton . 
  i have to admit , number 3 was hilarious . 
  it is impossible , absolutely im-pos-sib-le to try to have a conversation about x thing russia did without somehow and i mean any way possible , them finding a way to blame the whole thing/point out how usa did this x thing too so hey let 's concentrate on that instead of the actual subject . 
  there does n't exist a conversation about russia in the history of the internet without america being part of it . 
  including america is just the standard . 
  ca n't happen without it . 
  edit : aaaand what was the first comment i saw after finishing this and scrolling down : , d, 
  finally someone does something . 
  this madness has been going on for way too long . 
  unfortunately even if their permission to host the competition would be denied today it would n't bring all those who collapsed while working back to life . 
  even if this was just more like a symbolic gesture and they they knew it would n't really lead anywhere , they are forcing people to notice what 's happening . 
  good job . 
  well , sure . 
  however you did n't really express if you are just delivering information of how the russians are educated or if you believe it yourself . 
  people understood it was the latter , and downvoted you ( since it was extremely offensive ) . 
  to be honest i was confused myself which one it was , but did n't downvote you since i was n't sure . 
  so , which one it was ? 
  okay , i am sorry if you feel this way . 
  i think the problem was that it was very unclear if you think yourself like that too , or were you just describing what 's happening . 
  why did you remove the rest of your text ? 
  it was just the cherry on the top . 
   before that there were irrelevant fights in western europe , africa , pacific + we were involved into few minor conflicts over liberation of lands which were rightfully ours as a heritage from russian empire ( poland , baltics , finland , etc ) . 
  yup , sounds quite familiar . 
  it is either a ) you had to attack because we were such a huge threat to your existence or b ) we were n't really independent . 
   even had to deal with those nasty nazis to get the territories back with minimal effort - that was kind of diplomatic victory . 
  mmm . . yeah well . . hey btw , do you believe this yourself ? 
  how popular you would say these beliefs are in russia ? 
   was the soviet invasion of poland , annexation of baltics and ** finish war ** a preventive measures before inevitable war between nazism and communism ? 
  if by finish you mean finnish , the answer is no . 
  there you go , i answered with a fact . 
   your and our representations of this war are completely different ( even on a historical level ) well to be fair , the historical facts are not emotional subjects , they are simply facts . 
  and they can \u00b4 t be really disputed . 
  just out of curiosity , how your representation of war is like ? 
  jesus , out of everything , i think the `` thanks merkel '' - bs rages me the most . 
  it is some next level stupidness . 
  huh , what you mean ? 
  your food is too delicious , your people too friendly and men too goodlooking-kind of stuff ? 
  hey , same . 
  is n't france the country that has won the most wars in history anyway ? 
  their national anthem is about _ watering the fields with impure enemy blood _ ffs, 
  don \u00b4 t know . 
  maybe in some way yes , some ways no . 
  of course i have limited experience from elsewhere . 
  anyway i do sympathize a lot with you , i was personally suprised of this since i would have imagined finland would be worse for foreigners . 
  i can imagine it can be really hard to make new friends in finland . 
  if you want to share your experience , did you feel lonely or were people rude or what happened ? 
  i am sorry you had a bad experience . 
  :( and this is not sarcasm . 
  ( altough i have to add helsinki is real finland , or else i have been living in lie my whole life ), 
  okay , that \u00b4 s it . 
  can someone explain to me why r/shitenglishpeoplesay does n't exist ? 
  let me get this straight : you are really saying you are unaware of england \u00b4 s part in the great famine ? 
  but you know , i wouldn \u00b4 t be that surprised if you were serious . 
  r/europe seems to be flooding with brits ( or more like english ) whose little education has been replaced by nationalism . 
  right . 
  didn \u00b4 t realize you were trolling first . 
   very few people move away from our country to escape poverty like they do in india or poland or ** ireland ** . 
  unbelievable . 
   and even worse , then she said the exact same thing to the cashier , the poor guy whaat ?? 
  okay that \u00b4 s not even funny anymore , there was something truly wrong with her . 
  glad you come out safe and unharmed , you never know about those crazies what they are up to . . 
  i would have probably lost my capacity to act in that kind of shock . 
  but seriously , that is really strange behavior , i would go as far as saying that is a little bit rude to invade people \u00b4 s spaces when they are trying to mind their own business and survive through their day . 
  i have been alive for 21 years and that has never happened to me ( i naturally mean by people who are sober here ) . 
   `` the store is strangely empty today , '' she said . 
  '' ... yeah , '' i said . 
  she wasn \u00b4 t even forced to talk to you , that truly was casual small talk for no reason . 
  what caused her to go so insane , don \u00b4 t know , poor thing . 
  people sometimes behave irrationally under a lot of pressure , maybe she was on the verge of a burnout or meltdown or something . 
   explains the finnish stranger who tried to strike up a conversation with me in the checkout line at the grocery store the other day . 
  in sweden ? 
  yeah he was drunk . 
  ( or then it was a girl who thought you were hot . 
  in that case , hello ! ), 
  according the [ expat insider ] ( https://inassets1-internationsgmbh.netdna-ssl.com/static/bundles/internationsexpatinsider/images/2016/reports/ease_of_settling_in_index_full.jpg ) ** mexico ** is the easiest country to settle and to make friends . 
  don \u00b4 t think so .
