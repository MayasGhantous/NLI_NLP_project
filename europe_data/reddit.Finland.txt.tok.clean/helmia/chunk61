  i do n't know what my point is . 
  maybe that we need more pictures of norway . 
   finland is the poorest country in scandinavia with the lowest standard of living best in the world ? 
  what metric ?

  we make a great effort to make sure your parent 's wealth is n't the the factor that dictates your fate , that creates politics that lead to free university and school system , small income inequality ( unfortunately that is on the rise though , just like pretty much everywhere else in the world ... ) , safety ( least organized crime in the world ) and overall good health , high literacy rate , happiness and long life expectancy . 
  if i have to pick one thing i like the most in my country it is our maternity clinic system ( neuvola , i do n't know how to translate that ) . 
  you get check ups , education , support and help since the moment you realize you are pregnant ( and before that , if you want , in form of sexual health ) and for a many years after the child is born . 
  ( btw on a side note , you guys are doing horribly on this department . 
  good job on electing a president who wants to defund pp and therefore take a shit on the reproductive rights and health of millions of women , it 's not like your maternal mortality rates are n't already the highest in the developed world . ), 
  finland is in no way perfect or flawless though , and reading just reports can give an image that is too rosy . 
  we have a lot of things we have to work on and it is important to constantly get better . 
  however , referring to us as a `` poor country with no industry , one successful company and a low standard of living '' definitely is n't the case . 
  this report was provided to you by ~ ~ the propaganda ministry of finland ~ ~ a bored student who still has 2 hours to kill in a train and this was the perfect opportunity to concentrate on something else than my studies . 
  so thanks for triggering me , however now i do n't have any excuses to do something else than study so if you want to reply with something equally contemptuous and muricanlike so we can get into a beautiful flame war that would be great , thanks . 
   finlan numba 1  netherlands 36 [ n_n ] ( https://media3.giphy.com/media/utulngvl9p0xe/giphy.gif ) but in all seriousness , wtf ? 
  how is this possible ? 
  if we are `` the most eco-friendly country '' in the world , no wonder climate change is a lost cause . 
  i do n't get it . 
   edinburgh a bit less acoording to [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis ) edinburgh was 74,4 % remain . 
   but yup as a whole they were completely remain . 
   it was n't so much aimed at you as at the general tendency to attack russians about stalin 's atrocities , forgetting that the most numerous victims of stalin , those who had to suffer his reign of terror for the longest time , were russians . 
  so why are they praising him today ? 
  is the problem others bashing them or russians forgetting the victims themselves ? 
   finland lost any claim to the moral high ground what do you mean ? 
   when they closed the lines in the siege of leningrad which cost a million civilian lives can i have your source for that ? 
   in that situation of allying with the evil of nazi germany to get your land back you ca n't complain too loudly when it turns out to be a bad move . 
  i honestly do n't understand what you mean right here , especially in this context . 
  i do n't know if you mean it aimed to me or as in general . 
   but do n't you find it so sad about those poor finns ? 
   victims of . 
  in this particular case he is talking about that karelia that russia annexed during winter war . 
  that karelia where 75 000 people were forced to leave their homes prior winter war when there was a clear threat of non-provoked russian aggression , and after russia indeed did start the war 420 000 finns in total were forced to evacuate and leave their homes . 
  during continuation war most of them came back , hoping to settle in their homes but they were forced to leave for ever . 
  those concentration camps were there when finland was conquering the lost land back . 
  now , since i know someone will misunderstand in purpose : i am not defending or explaining away what finland did . 
  it was completely unacceptable . 
  those victims were mostly women , children and weak old men . 
  but in short , i think it is pretty clear that if they had n't attacked in the first place , those camps would n't have been there . 
  it just shows the different mental images a finn and a russian clearly have when hearing that word ( as a side note , i do n't share pontus_pilates view of karelia , even though it probably was a joke . 
  the `` get karelia back '' is usually a thing that only redneck idiots will joke about and i have never met anyone seriously missing that piece of land . 
  or well , also the otherwise sweet grandma who lived next door to us when i was a kid , but in all fairness she was originally from karelia and the war took her family and home so i guess that is understandable . ), 
   idea of bashing russians hmm . 
  well , in this particular case i was kinda highlighting the absurd manner he talked about the camps . 
  what comes to those gulags , russians _ definitely _ were n't the only victims of those concentration camps . 
  russian were the victims and the people managing those concentration camps , at the same time . 
  what i personally find the strangest is how stalin is n't seen as the monstrous tyrant he was , but seems to be almost praised and celebrated nowadays . 
  but yeah i do n't really see how my message above counts as bashing , nor i am not sure what kind of bashing you mean in general . 
   i like how sweden was `` neutral '' by letting nazis through their country to the finns while some swedes blew up the traintracks ahead of the german trains . 
  but staying neutral was the right move this stage of the war . 
  what do you mean `` neutral '' ? 
  you were perfectly neutral , not reason to state that sarcastically . 
  also you were neutral during the whole ww2 , including winter war , not just that stage of war . 
  it was clear that sweden did n't choose any sides in any way . 
  sweden refused to let allied help to finland as well . 
   props to the swiss . 
  in the middle of the shitstorm during the whole war . 
  dude , i do n't get it . 
  you can give props to your country just the same way ( i am guessing you are swedish ) , since that was literally ** exactly ** what you managed to do . 
  both your neighbour countries were going through hell and you guys were perfectly good , during the whole war . 
  i am sorry , but i find your message really stupid . 
  first because you are n't taking props for something that is clearly yours , second because you make it sound like switzerland just managed to do a sensible decision unlike the others , like war would n't have been forced without questions to others . 
  peace is the most precious luxury all the other countries except the aggressors would have loved to have more than anything . 
  i think it is pretty safe to say if finland could have had the choice to be left alone it would 've been have chosen that , considering the traumas of that war can _ still _ be seen in our society . 
   and sweden did n't let any military equipment or personnel move through their country until after norway had been occupied and finland picked side , despite threats and bribes . 
  hmm , i would n't really go with the term `` pick '' , since to pick something you need to have actually options . 
  but this is true , for example sweden denied the right for british and french help to pass through to finland . 
  it was n't just nazi germany , they refused the allies too . 
  you are correct , they were truly neutral . 
  [ i know bro ] ( https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7tkq7r3pfsuxu7do/giphy.gif ) . 
  that 's true , iceland recognized the shit out of former soviet countries . 
  estonia , latvia , lithuania , azerbaijan , georgia and armenia , all were a big middle finger to the second most powerful country existing that time ( yes yes soviet union recognized those countries too but still , at least here in finland we criticized our president for being a pussy and not recognizing estonia right away , according to him we had already once recognized it so there was n't a need to do it but that 's bs , we were just afraid of russia unlike those crazy little islanders ) . 
  also they were the first western country to recognize palestine . 
  those feisty little vikings with their funny hobbies . 
  football and recognizing countries . 
  that 's great , especially the cake is always important haha how old did you turn ? 
  good !, 
  happy to hear , i hope you 've had a good day . 
  happy birthday !, 
  why do you hare eu and want it to fall ? 
  did n't you have your birthday today ? 
  because he does n't care about the victims , that 's why . 
  therefore he genuinely does n't see anything wrong with his behavior . 
  are you serious ? 
  and macron 's raw sex appeal is n't only in his looks . 
  i did n't want to have babies with him until i actually started watching him speaking and therefore knowing his character . 
  he is more than just a pretty face . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jt7ts2z41c does n't start until ~ 37, 
  i have never in my life appreciated having boring politics . 
  i guess you really do n't know what you have until you lose it . 
  boring , stable and predictable would be heavenly at this point . 
  she did n't . 
  well , fortunately if those scandals are of sexual nature ( i mean involving consenting adults ) , the french dgaf . 
   so it could n't happen in a better country . 
  about what ? 
  sweet christ , the beginning of his speech when he winks at the crowd . 
  we all started screaming at the same time : dd he is so unbelievable cute looking like he is fighting tears before he starts speaking . 
  i know we should n't yet celebrate and it is very uncertain , but dear lord france is close to electing the sexiest man for president . 
  agreed . 
  usually these megathreads are _ so _ good , so this has been quite a disappointment .
