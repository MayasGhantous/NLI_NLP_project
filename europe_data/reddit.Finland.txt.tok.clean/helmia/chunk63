   southern ireland . 
  i wish that was just a meme . 
  they are horrified that someone would insult them like this , grouping us forest trolls with them . 
  he is honestly the most entertaining of them all . 
  he is quick , funny and smart . 
  what comes to other end , i honestly ca n't handle the way le pen sounds when she talks . 
  even if i would agree with her or consider her views worth listening , she has a way of speaking that is somehow _ so _ tiring just to listen . 
  no charisma , at all . 
  was n't edinburgh like 70 % remain ? 
   `` europe and your a racist bigot if you do n't agree !, 
  '' , i do n't think ** your ** going to get far tbf anyone who does this is n't going to get far . 
  haha yup you live and learn i guess !, 
  see you in tomorrowland !, 
  oh c'mon , that was just an accident . 
  do n't you know that every time he says something stupid it is just a [ slip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2iees9bzbg ) ? 
  i 'm completely fine with that, 
  even though i am so nervous and terrified of tomorrow , i would like to take a moment to appreciate how well made and lovely these elections megathreads always are . 
  this one is not an exception , even if you would n't have read one word the subject before you would get the idea after reading this , everything you need to know in a nutshell . 
  we followed the dutch elections from here and it was so handy . 
  that being said , allez macron !!, 
   sounds like ~ ~ merkel ~ ~ the pussy grabbed him ~ ~ by the pussy . ~ ~ ~ ftfy . 
  in the european union , pussy grabs you . 
  that 's fantastic !, 
  well done uk , 
  lol , sure , whatever comforts you buddy . 
  to be fair i think _ everyone _ gets along with the italians :d they are always the easy-going and friendly guys and girls , or that at least it seems like in the erasmus groups . 
  i do n't think making sensible political decision counts as being a pussy . 
  he is an outsider in politics , that 's why the people elected him . 
  of course he is going to try something as stupid as trying to negotiate a deal with a single eu country . 
  fortunately for us mama merkel got our back and showed him how she feel about his shitty attempts of divide and conquer . 
  thanks for that germany . 
  _ winter olympics _ ? 
  so what you are saying is that all the other nordic countries get nice compliments and we get a shitty mention about something that does n't even that much represent us , because we can not into relevant ? 
  triggered , probably because it is true . 
  cancelling my ticket to ireland right now . 
  otherwise a very nice map . 
  the orange baboon just happens to represent the most powerful and rich country in the world and we want the eu to prosper and thrive , so yes . 
  65\u00a0433\u00a0408 to be exact . 
   maybe he is already in the population of post-brexit united kingdom of england and wales ( / s just in case , people tend to be a bit too sensitive about this ) . 
  preferably not someone twice my age . 
  no he is n't , he is just playing with us [ easily fooled finns ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66cdu5/macron_holding_the_european_flag_during_his/dghfjed/ ) :d, 
  i do n't understand why i find these so funny, 
  no , not at all . 
  that 's young for a politician , i think he is even being criticized for being too young . 
  it was a stupid choice of words from me , i meant old for my taste in men . 
  hey , me too dude !, 
  off topic but can we acknowledge the fact that he is hot ? 
  like yeah he is ~ ~ old ~ ~ a little more mature i am used to , but for an ~ ~ old ~ ~ older guy he is super attractive . 
   it must 've been a trained bird because it was also holding a tiny eu flag in its beak . 
  are you serious right now ?? 
  it 's going to be interesting to see what the voter turnout will be and if people being too tired to care or participate will show on it . 
  my first thought after reading the news . 
  or more like the second , the first one being `` what the fuck ?? '' . 
  definitely did not see this one coming . 
   interesting times . 
  yeah , i am more than happy to get off this interesting ride at this point . 
  boring , predictable and stable would sound absolutely fucking heavenly . 
   ( edit : myself included ) lol : , d, 
  i ca n't believe there is only few days left to go , i 'm so nervous . 
  this is a defining moment for eu . 
  i am so sorry . 
  i wish you get to canada and meanwhile stay safe . 
  please do not abandon us in the moment of great darkness . 
  this is really , really sad . 
  i ca n't imagine what this will mean to the poor sane turkish people , they must be horrified . 
  it is particularly upsetting that european turks voted yes in such large numbers . 
  i know i am appalled by the 30 % of finnish turks who voted yes . 
  they should n't live here . 
  if you are willing to turn your ( apparently what you consider your ) homeland to a medieval shithole , then do so by actually living there and facing the consequences , there is no excuses for their behavior . 
  yes , m\u00e4mmi is our cuisine ( unfortunately ) but m\u00e4mmipizza _ definitely _ is n't something that counts as `` our cuisine '' . 
  every spoonful is like a little brown piece of death . 
   its somewhat greenish colour on the right makes it look very unappetising . 
  so only the colour did that for you ? 
  how dare you suggest this is our cuisine ? 
  u/jyben , why you do this ? 
  the gordon ramsay-thing was n't enough for you ? 
  is n't there any limit to your karma whoring , even putting a title suggesting this is normal activity ? 
  have n't we suffered [ enough ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/suomi/comments/65oxc0/m%c3%a4mmipizzaa_p%c3%a4%c3%a4si%c3%a4iseksi/ ) already , now you want to spread this cancer ? 
  for actual _ italians _ to see ? 
  to all the concerned , disgusted and thoroughly appalled people seeing this horrible crime against humanity : please do not judge us all for one sick individual . 
  we would like you to know r/suomi strictly condemns his actions and we are deeply concerned . 
  we are currently taking action and investigating how long will it take to strip him off his citizenship . 
  do not pray for us since we are not a religious nation . 
  if you must , bow your heads and take a moment to remember those italians and other southern europeans who did n't make it after seeing this . 
  hihi thank you !, 
  i am sorry i did n't mean it that way . 
  i really hope you find a way to come . 
  and meanwhile you are figuring that out just ... stay safe and let 's hope for the best . 
  ooh it \u00b4 s my cake day ?? 
  jeij !!, 
  i ca n't see that on my phone :d i am going to spend my cake day wish for hoping there will be a miracle . 
  in finland it takes long too , and we have like ~ 69 million people less than they do . 
  election nights are an exciting event that go long into the night , not something that just happens in few hours . 
  they are counting so incredibly fast it 's pretty much a new result every time i refresh the page . 
  i am so confused , i 've never witnessed something like this . 
  88 % of votes counted , yes leading at 52 % . 
  i think it is safe to say no lost . 
  what this will mean ? 
  someone who actually can take a good guess , how this will change the lives of turkish people , how this will affect the eu , everything ? 
  i know it does ' t mean anything , but i feel so bad for people like you .
