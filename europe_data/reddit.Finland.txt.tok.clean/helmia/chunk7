  glad we replaced the uk with them . 
  ( altought we ranked 54 in friendliness and 59 in making friends . 
  plz don \u00b4 t get rid of us :( ) edit : oh yeah and what comes the subject , in 1960 \u00b4 s we sent a lot of traumatized violent alcoholics who ended up jobless and in all kinds of trouble . 
  probably scared those poor swedes away from foreigners for good . 
  sorry about that . 
  umm , why / s ? 
  what 's sarcastic in your response ? 
  since you are unable to do so . 
  but hey since you are responding , please provide the sources for your claims , would you ? 
  also please explain the logic you have behind them . 
   or are you implying that soviet lied ? 
  _ the soviets lying _ ? 
  nooooo , of course not !!, 
  after all we as the attackers ( and therefore with the upper hand , obviously ) had all the time and possibilities in the world to carefully consider what we want or do n't want to sign , therefore we happily gave up 11 % landmass and examined every word carefully before signing , since the terrified russians just had to protect themselves so far into our country that we were n't in a tough place at all . 
  not to mention the fact i have never seen this part of the peace treaty either . 
  hey btw i would love you to answer in finnish . 
  yup , we just could n't help ourselves , it was too much of a good idea to pass . 
  after all , we were a dirt poor developing country that _ just _ got our independence from russia 's oppression and started to recover from the horrible civil war . 
  but nope , we had this glorious idea to conquer the world and attacked our neighbor with +100 million people and the most powerful military . 
  russia was just so horrified they had no choice but to attack to protect themselves , poor things :( the propaganda is so insane that it would be funny . 
  it would be funny if so many people would n't believe it . 
  but yeah , what a enormous surprise to find a `` finn '' in a thread that is about russian aggression . 
  to anyone who does n't know what 's going on : russia has owned the shellings of mainila that started the winter war previously . 
  however , nowadays the old propaganda is starting to rise again , and it is quite scary . 
  edit : if anyone is interested [ here ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/putin_winter_war_aimed_at_correcting_border_mistakes/6539940 ) is an example of how putin sees the winter war . 
   russian president vladimir putin says that the soviet union launched the winter war with finland in order to `` correct mistakes '' that had been made when finland gained its independence in 1917 . 
   `` ** the border was just 20 kilometres from st petersburg and that was a significantly major threat to a city of five million ** , '' said putin on thursday , addressing the russian military historical society at novo-ogaryovo , one of his official residences near moscow . 
  the bolsheviks later realised that the agreed border was too close to the city , known in the soviet era as petrograd and then leningrad . 
  so he agrees the soviets launched the war , but it was just because we were such an enormous threat . 
  there was no other possibility . 
  so like this guy here he is proposing that they have a reason to be concerned now ( but unlike putin , he reaches the propaganda even more far to the point we started the war ) . 
  these are not small things to write . 
  i just answered that :d i guess i should edit it since it seems to be pissing swedes off . 
  since i knew there were lots of swedish volunteers in finland but he chose to use the example about swedes leaving to ss ( especially that there were loads of them ) so i draw a stupid conclusion that he meant that there were a bigger number of swedes leaving to ss than to finland . 
  i didn \u00b4 t think about it too much before writing . 
  the end . 
   most of em got stuck in winter war and continuation war . 
  what do you mean with got stuck ? 
   while finland had actually more people leaving for ss due the finish gov conducted recruitment for the ss to show they were on germany side . 
  yup pretty much this , there were about 1200 who left , unfortunately . 
   what ? 
  he never said anything about numbers true , but he chose the example to be about the ss and that there were `` loads '' of them , so i went ahead and did my own conclusions . 
  just posing a question really , since it sounded so unfamiliar . 
   we were seeing loads of people joing the ss ~ ~ more swedes left for ss than to finland ? 
  : o i never knew that ~ ~, 
  many finnish jihadists have returned `` home '' . 
  i found an article ( in finnish ) from 2014 that explains how we deal with them ( however it is a trash tabloid magazine , but overall i think it is quite reliable ) http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000825661.html in finland if you have been is isis and return back , you will be `` questioned '' ( the wrong word , since the good translation would be something like `` have a chat '' ) by the police . 
  `` we will have a contact and go see them . 
  we will meet and try to have a conversation about things , and to evaluate if there is need for _ help _ . '', 
  helsinki police department says . 
  overall the jihadist coming back will be received by a network made of polices , social workers and psychiatric nurses . 
  we are concentrating on helping them and , and even the police will only start a preliminary investigation only if there `` is a reason to suspect they have committed crimes '' . 
  to my understanding these kind of actions have been approved by a lot of scientist studying jihadism . 
  the help is given so the jihadists returning wo n't become a threat to the finnish society , or that they wo n't recruit more jihadist or return themselves to isis . 
  in short , the return is welcoming and we don \u00b4 t have the right to take their passports or forbid them entering the country ( for this i don \u00b4 t know the reason why ) . 
  i remember reading an article in suomen kuvalehti where the journalist had a contact to a finnish somali girl who left to isis . 
  she was pregnant and considered coming back to finland to give birth and then leaving back to syria . 
  so i am guessing the jihadist know it is easy to come back . 
  so in other words , theoretically it is completely possible to go to isis , rape sex slaves , torture , murder and do whatever those scums enjoy doing , come back and have absolutely zero consequences . 
  or more like the consequences being you receiving therapy and the state being concerned of your wellbeing and why you left in the first place . 
  there might be good reasons why we act the way we do , but damn does n't it feel absurd ( but overall our juridical system is only harsh to people committing financial crimes so it is n't necessarily surprising , it is completely possible to rape , kill and torture and get nothing else than a short probation ) ... 
  personally i simply do n't see why the law could n't be changed so they would lose their finnish passport and the right to enter the country when they leave , and _ if _ they somehow return , they should have no business on mixing with normal people . 
  yesterday a man grabbed my crotch and ass from behind so strongly i almost fell . 
  not to mention i had a heart attack since i had my earpieces on and didn \u00b4 t hear them approaching . 
  they both found what happened and my reaction really funny . 
  i don \u00b4 t really have problem thinking those dudes couldn \u00b4 t have violated women in much more horrible ways . 
  it is unreal we are letting these people walk among us . 
  haha well played :d but seriously the quality is good . 
  oh that 's interesting . 
   i have to consider romania for the next nomnom-destination, 
  til we forced the jews to wear yellow stars . 
   i was merely pointing out that it is not illegal to travel abroad to get an abortion , since decktheballz said it was . 
  misinformation , no matter how little , about the issue , can make many people believe something that is n't true . 
  oh yes i agree 100 % with you and i hope my message didn \u00b4 t come out as an personal `` attack '' or something like that , i was speaking of the issue in general . 
   we have had , to my knowledge , five referendums on the matter of abortion . 
  no referendum thus far has proposed for the legality of abortion . 
  oh my , that \u00b4 s a lot !, 
  what the referendums have been about then ? 
  just reading the headline sent shivers down my spine . 
  i really hope this is just some kind of misunderstanding or there is some factor that means it isn \u00b4 t really that big of a deal , but damn this feels scary right now . 
  could you please name one ? 
   lol okay . 
  because i posted like 3 comments about the recent case on mvlehti ? 
  maybe youre in such a blind fury that your brain filters out everything apart from `` mvlehti '' . 
  oh don \u00b4 t worry , those `` three comments '' surely aren \u00b4 t the only ones . 
   did i defend janitskins bullshit and spread his claim that hes persecuted for political reasons ? 
  oh you didn \u00b4 t ? 
  i am such a strange person than when someone literally writes `` his chase has a clear political aspect and pressure in it '' that i believe him to mean they are persecuting him because of political reasons . 
  however , if that isn \u00b4 t enough , maybe https://www.reddit.com/r/suomi/comments/4v8yqo/mvsivusto_toimii_taas/d5xbmij this will help your memory on your attitude towards this whole thing . 
  literal translation : `` pretty questionable to make an exception on a certain guy and demand interpol to arrest him ** and simply because there is a certain political pressure to silence him ** . 
  even i don \u00b4 t particularly value the mv-magazine , there is a clear political aspect and pressure in this hunt . 
  understandable but we are entering the tree ass first ( meaning arresting him is the wrong way to go ) . 
  first of all this ( kind of behavior ) has no place in constitutional state . 
  secondly , the popularity of the magazine will only grow and ilja gets to benefit from his reputation of the politically hounded . 
  it isn \u00b4 t even possible to get a international warrant with the current accusations like the media has been shouting . 
  and if ilja on top of everything gives up his dual citizen , nothing ( good ) will come out of this . 
  i was waiting for one of you people to pop up , i almost ended up adding the warning to my original text , but didn \u00b4 t have the energy for it . 
  after reading your message it was such huge surprise to find your post history to be mostly about mv-lehti , i especially enjoyed this piece https://www.reddit.com/r/suomi/comments/54wkla/ilja_janitskin_aikoo_hakea_turvapaikkaa/d85mm09 . 
  to the people who don \u00b4 t understand finnish , mv-lehti was a trash `` magazine '' ( which is pushing that word very far even excluding the actual content , since the dude was unable to write proper finnish ) founded by a russian troll , whose primary concern was to post racist shit , post shit on refugees , shit on nato and spread propaganda how the finnish media/government shouldn \u00b4 t be trusted ( exactly what the dude is doing right now ) . 
  needless to say , it was popular among uneducated neo-nazis and overall people who believe people with darker skin are not humans .
