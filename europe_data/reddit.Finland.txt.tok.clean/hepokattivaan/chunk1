of course war is always unfortunate , but you ca n't just bend over and take it in the ass all the time . 
  sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and those weaker than you . 
  russia is , like i said in the post above , invading a sovereign european nation as we speak and your solution would be to do nothing and let it happen ? 
  what if russia invaded finland , ( the only european non-nato country bordering russia , not counting ukraine ) your home country and the international community would do nothing and just watch it happen ? 
  oh , please ... russia is ** fighting a war in europe ** as we speak , even though there is undeniable evidence they still deny everything . 
  you ca n't trust a single word that comes out of their mouths , you never could . 
  while they 're ** invading a sovereign european nation ** , you want to ` ease tensions ' by doing nothing ? 
  tuomioja is one of those anti-nato hippiecommies who always think `` what would russia think of this '' before making a decision on anything foreign policy related - it makes me sick . 
  i hate how finlandization is still a thing even to this day , russia has shown its true colors with ukraine , hell , we should 've seen this coming after the 2008 georgia war . 
  we should 've joined nato in 1991 already . 
  russia will always be russia and it only respects power , therefore there should , absolutely , be permanent nato bases in the baltics and even in finland for that matter . 
  move finland from sooma-balti to nordiskannen and you have my vote :d, 
  how can you support multiculturalism and have an anti-immigration policy at the same time ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  the law clearly states that yle must support tolerance and multiculturalism . 
  the most hot topic in european media right now is immigration and of course yle must report on the subject . 
  the problem is that by law it is thus required to do just that , support multiculturalism ( which i think open immigration is an integral part of ) , so the reports have a very clear pro-immigration bias to them . 
  i disagree , i think it says exactly that . 
  and just looking at the yle front page every day proves that to be a fact . 
  every . 
  single . 
  article . 
  is all about the `` wonders of multiculturalism '' and how `` finns are backwards '' or `` look at this poor refugee child '' . 
  i do n't remember seeing a single truly objective article from yle ( or any other mainstream media house in finland ) weighing the pros and cons of taking in tens of thousands of uneducated immigrants from africa and the middle-east where the culture and customs are a light year apart from our own . 
  are n't they one and the same ? 
  yes . 
  these and other content services related to public service may be provided in public communications networks nationally and regionally . 
  ( 2 ) the public service programming shall in particular : ... 5 ) ; support tolerance and multiculturalism and provide programming for minority and special groups ; 6 ) promote cultural interaction and provide programming directed abroad ;, 
  finnish armed forces are stronger at defending finland than the uk , french or german armed forces , yes . 
  and that 's the only thing that matters in this case . 
  are we thinking of the same iraqi army here ? 
  the one that drops all of its equipment and runs when faced with jihadists in black pyjamas holding ak 's ? 
  the one that 's soldiers can barely read or write ? 
  you 're comparing that ^ with an educated , trained , modern and well equipped european army like the french ? 
  i 'm definitely pro-nato , but there are some issues that i want to see addressed first . 
  first of all , we should not cut down on defence spending and trust our national defence on a 3rd party like nato / us . 
  we should increase defence spending to 2 % of gdp ( currently at 1.3 % ) * and * join nato . 
  sadly however , the popular opinion here seems to be that if we were to join nato , we could save on defence spending and that frightens me . 
  second , we should not disband conscription in favor of a fully professional military . 
  sweden tried that and failed miserably , even with sweden 's 9.5 million population , they ca n't recruit enough people into the army and it is now almost entirely a peacekeeping / small scale crisis management / intervention military instead of a military capable of national defence . 
  what we should do , is keep our conscription system and on top of that , form a professional brigade sized expeditionary force capable of independent operations to fulfill our nato obligations . 
  there are also some really weird misconceptions and misunderstandings . 
  for example ; many people here think that if we were to join nato , it would mean that our conscripts would have to `` fight america 's wars '' in the middle east , which is absolutely not true . 
  anyway , what i 'm trying to say is that i do n't want us to destroy our own capability to defend this country and become yet another `` leech '' in nato . 
  if that would be the case however , then i would rather stay out of nato and focus on national defence . 
  nordic *, 
  again , you 're way overestimating the capabilities and the level of technology of the russian military . 
  russian military still is , despite of grand speeches and propaganda , at its core ( the less media-sexy brunt of the forces ) very much still the same old corrupt inefficient and outdated organization . 
   what difference does swampy ground make to artillery and aircraft ? 
  because the russian army is n't just going to roll in with tanks on finland and walk straight into the minefields . 
  they 'll knock out your airforce in about a day and then bombard you to hell . 
  swampy ground has a very large impact on the effectiveness of traditional non-airburst munitions , which are by far the most plentiful munitions in russian stockpiles . 
  knock out the air force with what , exactly ? 
  russian air force is largely outdated and it ca n't even keep most of its aircraft operational , most of its equipment is rusting away in soviet era airbases or some random fields if highly corrupt officers have n't sold them off for spare parts or junk metal . 
   ukraine is n't just open fields and if you look at drone surveillance that 's being done in ukraine it 's not like it 's just about spotting things in open fields . 
  small , handmade drones and professional ones are being used , not even talking about ones with thermal , and within 10 minutes of being spotted you get shot to hell with artillery and have to abandon your position . 
  this is the reality . 
  but it is though . 
  ukraine is ridiculously open flatlands and fields as far as the eye can see for the most part , the terrain provides very little cover or concealment against aerial reconnaissance . 
  but hey , if you really want to believe in putin 's magical big red button that makes thermal imagers or visual-spectrum cameras on small drones see through thick brush , wood and modern multispectral camouflage nets , be my guest . 
   more advanced drones , aircraft reconnaissance , satellite , monitoring communications , this is what will happen in a conflict between finland and russia . 
  a battalion is n't going to be able to hide in finland , no matter how much fancy camo you give it or how thick the forests are . 
  the vehicles , the defences , everything will be spotted and bombarded with artillery and air power . 
  drones and manned aircraft still ca n't find dispersed and camouflaged forces , not unless circling over the area for extended periods of time , resulting in being shot down . 
  monitoring communications goes both ways , it 's not like the russians are the only ones capable of doing it , again , unlike most of the conflict zones today , this is not some barely literate third world shithole living in the 13th century . 
  radio silence is a really basic thing and most communications go through modern and highly secure datalinks . 
  every artillery firing decision has to be thought through and pros and cons evaluated because again , russia is not the only one capable of precise and immediate counter battery artillery fire . 
  russia is not the only one with long range air or ground launched precision guided munitions either . 
   the use of tactical nukes has been part of russian doctrine for a while now . 
  sure , when russia itself is under attack and can not defend itself with conventional means . 
  russian doctrine does not call for offensive use of nuclear weapons unless it is on the receiving end of such weapons itself . 
  not since the end of the cold war . 
   it relies on outdated assumptions about russia 's military and the kind of warfare it would pursue , as in , the thinking is that russia would go for a full scale armoured assault and then get trapped in pre-set ambush points and slowly bled . 
   the soviets and russia 20 years ago might have pursued this doctrine , but today ? 
  russia would never commit to this kind of warfare , they would use drones and airpower and long range artillery , they would never send in armoured spearheads that are vulnerable to infantry and mines without adequate support and clearing of opposition beforehand . 
  chechnya changed their doctrine regarding armoured warfare . 
  it is based on extensive studies and simulations that are possible because it 's pretty much the only damn thing the military has been preparing for for the past 100 years . 
  there is no other way to conduct offensive military maneuvers here , you 'd know that i ' f you ever came here and looked around . 
  it 's not open desert like iraq or open fields like ukraine and georgia . 
  it 's incredibly thick brush and forest , you 're not going to see shit with your drones and thermals . 
  aircraft can be shot down , artillery and electronic warfare can be countered and the use of nuclear weapons is extremely unlikely . 
  ukraine is a third world banana republic compared to the nordics or just about any other western european country and the electronic warfare capabilities and equipment of ukraine reflects that . 
  the doctrine was updated just last year to counter the modern russian armed forces . 
  you clearly have no clue of what you 're talking about . 
  lol . 
  okay , keep telling yourself that . 
  edit : russia 's western military district consists of around 250 000 - 300 000 personnel , a large part of which are support personnel and not direct combat units . 
  the basic rule in warfare is that you generally need at least 3:1 ratio as the attacking force , more than that when the defending force is entrenched or otherwise fortified ( naturally defendable terrain ) . 
  finnish wartime armed forces alone are ~ 230 000 personnel and the terrain is ** heavily ** [ wooded ] ( https://richardbrenneman.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/blog-trees.jpg?w=500&amp;h=417 ) and [ broken ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e5bxw7pkyns/tzaqcmks9ci/aaaaaaaaczo/pqcmg107yjk/s1600/new_1_dscf5802.jpg ) , naturally defendable terrain . 
  there are ( on purpose ) few east-west highways and most roads are small and narrow [ logging roads ] ( http://www.teuva.fi/maisema/ark/mg0068_s.jpg ) made of dirt . 
  there are an incredible amount of bottlenecks and ambush points , russian forces are primarily armored and reliant on the road network . 
  there are very few places where russian armored colums could conceivably advance and those places are pre-targeted by artillery , heavily mined and defended by infantry . 
  there simply is n't enough space for russia to conduct military maneuvers the way it wants ( concentrated , armored columns punching wide holes into the defence and dragging support troops in ) , the battlespace simply does n't allow that here , there just is n't enough room . 
  instead , the russians would be forced to throw more and more troops into the meatgrinder without being able to support them with flanking armored columns . 
  the entire finnish doctrine is based on this . 
  finnish forces are for the most part highly networked light infantry units and the entire doctrine is based on inflicting high amounts of casualties on advancing russian armored columns in wooded terrain . 
  then if you somehow get through , you have to go through sweden and nato-norway and nato-denmark with whatever troops you have left . 
  and all this time you have to keep your forces supplied . 
  good luck with that . 
  i 'm pro-nato in general , but that is the exact reason i 'm still hesitant about it .
