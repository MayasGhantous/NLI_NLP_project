  nato membership might give the politicians a `` good reason '' ( in their eyes ) to cut defense spending ( leeching on u.s. military presence in europe ) and thus force the military to adopt a similar mentality to so many other small nato nations . 
  there is no eu military . 
  most militaries in the eu are built for small scale operations in third world countries , some are not . 
  finnish military for example never shifted focus away from defending against a full-scale land/air/sea invasion from the east . 
  you 're way overestimating russia 's military capabilities . 
  [ english proficiency across the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/ef_english_proficiency_index.svg/2000px-ef_english_proficiency_index.svg.png ) . 
  considering that the finnish language is not related to english in any way ( unlike the scandinavian languages ) , i 'd say that 's pretty good . 
  yep . 
  the idea of [ greater finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_finland ) certainly was a `` thing '' in 1917-1944 but to say that it was the goal of the finnish state or that the majority of the population thought so is a great exaggeration . 
  the political movements supporting the idea of greater finland never gained enough support to have any real impact , finland was ( is ) a democratic nation after all . 
  during the continuation war the goal of the finnish army was to seize back the land lost to the soviet union in the winter war , which was achieved . 
  the army did advance further than the old border in some places to secure more naturally defendable borders and to create a bufferzone between the soviet union and the pre-winter war borders . 
  germans for example tried to get the finns to advance on leningrad , which the finns refused having secured the old pre-winter war border .

  there is a difference between the goals of the state , the armed forces of the state and those of minority ( although large minority ) political movements . 
  the finnish state did n't have expansionist goals the way ger-ita-jap did . 
   did hitler demand any concessions regarding jews from finland ? 
  from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_finland#world_war_ii :  8 jews were handed over to the germans and when finnish media reported the news , it caused a national scandal , and ministers resigned in protest . 
  after protests by lutheran ministers , the archbishop , and the social democratic party , no more foreign jewish refugees were deported from finland . 
   approximately 300 finnish jews fought in the continuation war , and eight were killed in action . 
  some finnish jews who were fluent in german served in finnish intelligence . 
  as finland 's forces had substantial numbers of german forces supporting their operations , the finnish front had a field synagogue operating in the presence of nazi troops . 
   three finnish jews were offered the iron cross for their wartime service : leo skurnik , salomon klass , and dina poljakoff . 
  major leo skurnik , a district medical officer in the finnish army , organized an evacuation of a german field hospital when it came under soviet shelling . 
  more than 600 patients , including ss soldiers , were evacuated . 
  captain salomon klass , also of the finnish army , who had lost an eye in the winter war , led a finnish unit that rescued a german company that had been surrounded by the soviets . 
  dina poljakoff , a member of lotta sv\u00e4rd , the finnish women 's auxiliary service , was a nursing assistant who helped tend to german wounded , and came to be greatly admired by her patients . 
  all three refused the award . 
  the [ finnish swastika ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_use_of_the_swastika_in_the_early_20th_century#finland ) had absolutely [ nothing to do with nazi germany ] ( http://20thcenturybattles.com/2013/06/03/the-misunderstood-finnish-swastika/ ) . 
  finnish military adopted the swastika in 1918 ( well before nazi germany ) when a swedish baron donated the finnish air force its first plane . 
  the swastika was the baron 's personal `` good luck '' emblem . 
   i wish the united states had done more to help finland . 
  iirc all we sent over was a handful of volunteers and some airplanes ( half of which did n't even work ) . 
  the [ brewster buffalo 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smxe0f1ozps ) bought from the u.s. turned out to be the finnish air force 's deadliest fighter aircraft in the war . 
  brewster buffalo 's combat losses in finland were 19 planes ( 494 enemy aircraft shot down ) which gives the brewster buffalo a kill-ratio of about 26:1 in finnish service . 
  the most successful airframe was bw-364 with 42,5 kills , after crosschecking with soviet archives , making it the world 's most successful single fighter airframe . 
  all in all 37 finnish air force pilots became buffalo aces . 
  there were a few instances where british and finnish forces fought against eachother in ww2 , namely the british [ raids on kirkenes and petsamo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_on_kirkenes_and_petsamo ) and the royal air force 's [ no . 
  151 fighter wing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no._151_wing_raf ) briefly fought alongside the soviets , against the finns and the germans in northern finland / murmansk area . 
  nothing major though , as you said . 
  like stalin 's soviet union was any better . . and by definition neither finland or estonia was an axis power . 
  not that i 'd be shameful of it even if it were the case , but it was n't . 
  legal gun owners really have to go through hoops to acquire a firearms though . 
  at least in finland : * you have a good reason for wanting to own a firearm ( hunting , sports shooting and in some cases a work-related need are pretty much the only ones ) . 
  * you have to be able to show that you have a place where you can safely use said firearm . 
  * you must have a clean criminal record . 
  * every doctor is liable to report any patient he or she believes should not own a firearm . 
  * you are interviewed by the local police department ( in-person ) before the decision is made . 
  * the whole process is horribly bureaucratic and expensive . 
  * every morning the police cross-checks the firearms owner database and the previous day 's police activity , if a firearm owner commits a crime ( even speeding ! ), 
  his or hers firearms license is temporarily revoked and the police will show up and confiscate you firearms pending an investigation . 
  sometimes you get your firearms back , sometimes not , depending on the seriousness of the crime . 
  it can take months to get them back though . 
  all of this leads to one thing : ** legal gun owners are the most law abiding demographic in the entire country ** , if they fuck up and commit a crime their guns are taken away the next morning . 
  many have spent tens of thousands of euros on them and hunting / sports shooting is a beloved hobby , even a way of life to many . 
  now here comes the eu and it treats all legal firearms owners like criminal scum , terrorists and whatnot , when the truth is the exact opposite - legal firearms owners are model citizens . 
  making it harder to legally own firearms does n't do anything to the real problem , which is smuggled fully automatic firearms from eastern europe / balkans and the middle-east and north africa . 
  criminals and terrorists will always have guns . 
  i 'm sure you can understand why legal gun owners are angry about this proposed eu legislation . 
  this one , apparently . 
  drunk idiots .

  i 'm sure we 've benefited from eu membership , but i fucking ** hate ** the eu with passion whenever it tries to pass stupid directives ( like the firearms directive ) that have absolutely nothing to do with free trade , movement or economy , but instead move the eu more and more towards a soviet-like union . 
  eu should focus on trade and economy and let sovereign countries stay sovereign . 
  by what logic does more guns mean more crime ? 
  if anything , more legal guns means less crime . 
  there are 670 000 gun license holders and 1 600 000 legal firearms in finland ( population 5 400 000 ) . 
  that averages out at around 29,6 legal firearms / 100 people . 
  the data on op 's link is based on a bullshit study by `` small arms survey '' in 2007 , it literally pulls an estimate of illegal firearms out if its own ass and adds that number to the total amount , in finland 's case it estimated 800 000 illegal firearms with no sources to back that up . 
  i guess it 's similarly inaccurate data in many other countries pictured on the map . 
  federalized europe will never work if it consists of all the 28 current eu member states . 
  cultural differences ( way of life , mindset , language to name a few ) are simply too big . 
  did you not read the analysis ? 
  it 's well backed by actual sources and facts , unlike the article on yle . 
  it being on a gun friendly site has fuck all to do with its credibility . 
  there were 108 homicides in finland in 2013 , 15 of which were with a firearm ( ~ 16 % ) . 
  that 's not a very big sampling to go by . 
  sam kingsley writes complete anti-gun biased horseshit that 's wildly misleading and often straight up lies based on bullshit studies .

  schengen has to go , at least temporarily until the situation is even remotely under control . 
  fund the creation of safe zones in north africa , build large refugee camps there and provide aid for those that are truly in need , economic `` refugees '' looking for free handouts should be turned around . 
  deploy elements of [ eu battlegroups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) to provide security on a rotational basis in said safe zones . 
  eu has been looking for an excuse to use these forces ever since their creation , here it is . 
  begin massive deportations of criminal migrants and economic refugee-migrants looking for handouts . 
  bring schengen back country by country , as soon as said country has strenghtened its customs and border protection to an acceptable level . 
  stop bombing random people in the middle-east .

  i never said i thought it was a bad thing , other than the cost being a bit high . 
  [ driver 's license in finland ] ( https://youtu.be/wnyghaxbdsm ) costs around 2000 euros , why does it cost that much ? 
  because of the ludicrous amounts of classroom theory and all kinds of tests ( watch the video ) .
