   then it 's pretty melodic finnish can be pretty damn melodic when sang , like [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/cnepqgwdbh8?t=4s ) . 
  a nordic union consisting of iceland , denmark , norway , sweden , finland ( and perhaps estonia and scotland/uk ) . . ehh ... maybe ? 
  not completely against the idea , but not really for it either . 
  i like our sovereignty , we paid a hard price for it . 
  looking at [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pyqklui.png ) two [ graphs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wg6mwyb.png?1 ) , i guess i 'm not the only one who thinks this way . 
  a `` united states of europe '' or a single european `` superstate '' ? 
  - fuck no . 
  culture , language , mindset , way of life , politics , everything is so different across the entire eu , especially between northern europe and southern/eastern eruope that it would never work . 
  i do n't think you know what brigading means in this context . 
  it means linking this thread to people and telling them to go upvote / comment on it . 
  which i do n't see happening here . 
  0.32 homicides with firearms and ~ 3.06 suicides with firearms per 100 000 people annually in finland . 
   i own a bike , i really do n't care when people in large talk about bikes . 
  i think you might care more about it if bikes were in danger of being banned entirely whenever someone did something stupid with them . 
   it 's just a tool , and yeah i 'm starting to realize how those who hunt as a hobby might care more . 
  they want to keep proper tools at hand . 
  i 'm not trying to be anti-gun or other way around , just you know . . most really do not care . 
  i understand , if you or the people you hang out with have no such interest then it may seem irrelevant altogether , what i 'm trying to say tho , is that there are a lot of people in finland that own firearms and not only for hunting purposes . 
   no one is going to blame guns if some nutjob does crazy shit , just like people are not blaming the cars they drive . 
  but that 's exactly what 's happening here , some nutjobs killed people in paris with illegal guns and now eu is trying to ban the legal guns that had nothing to do with the whole paris thing . 
   do you know many people who are into gun hobbies other than hunting ? 
  honestly sort of interested , even all the war nuts here go for airsoft stuff over real guns . 
  yes , majority of my family and friends own firearms and use them for hunting , shooting sports and reservist training . 
  some popular shooting sports for example are : ipsc , practical , sra finnish ipsc and practical shooters do very well in international competitions and regularly win medals . 
  because this thread is mostly about seeking an exception by playing the reservist card , here are some videos about sra ( sovellettu reservil\u00e4isammunta / applied reservist 's shooting ) , which is a finnish branch of the shooting sport called practical . 
  tens of thousands of finnish reservists practice this kind of shooting and take part in competitions all over finland .

  how nice of you to speak on behalf of over 5 million people ... not  finns in general feel absolutely nothing about guns 670000 gun owners and 1.6 million legal firearms says otherwise . 
  czech republic has a relaxed and working gun legislation . 
  basically anyone can get a firearm and carry a pistol concealed for self-defence , by going through classes on firearm safety and gun legislation of course . 
  civilians own more than a 136 000 handguns and most carry for self-defence . 
  czech republic is one of the safest countries in the world and had a whopping 2 homicides with legal firearms in 2010 in a country of over 10 million people . 
  czech republic has 0.15 firearm related homicides per 100 000 people . 
  [ gun politics in the czech republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_the_czech_republic ) [ list of countries by firearm related death-rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ), 
  http://www.parlament.gv.at/pakt/eu/xxv/eu/08/82/eu_88221/imfname_10597711.pdf page 41 onwards, 
  technically it 's not too hard to do ( still not doable by an amateur ) , but you 'd need a full auto sear/trigger and a full auto bolt carrier to turn your semi auto rifle into a fully automatic one . 
  those are highly controlled parts and already illegal , you 'd have to get those from the black market and at that point it 'd be easier to just get a working full auto rifle . 
  if you have the expensive cnc machinery and accurate ( !! ), 
  blueprints to make these in your garage , one could argue that you might as well make the rest of the gun there and then . 
  if you get the measurements even slightly wrong you 're going to have the second round either blow up on your face or not fire at all ... 
  proposal available in 23 languages here : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?qid=1449398299113&amp;uri=consil%3ast_14422_2015_init a good summary of recent events regarding this eu proposal here in english : http://www.toiminta-ampujat.fi/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=32778 this has been in the making since 2013 by a group of extremely anti-gun biased people in the eu and was pushed forward immediately following the paris attacks to take advantage of people 's feelings . 
  it was deemed `` urgent '' by the eu so no impact assessment has been made . 
  czech republic has much more lax gun legislation and allows concealed carry . 
  czech parliament has also stated that it does not approve of this proposal by the eu commission . 
  because millions of europeans own such firearms for a wide range of legal activities and uses and the eu commission is proposing confiscation without compensation ? 
  https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/12/islamic-state-atrocities-fuelled-by-decades-of-reckless-arms-trading/ https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/, 
  so you 're unwilling to blame all refugees in general for the actions of a few in paris for example , that 's good , i get that . 
  but at the same time you 're happy to throw millions of other innocent europeans ( gun owners ) under the bus for something someone did with an already illegal weapon ? 
  by sending weapons to the kurds and the shady-as-fuck free syrian army ? 
  european countries and the us are actively arming fighters in syria and since it 's the [ biggest clusterfuck ever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_armed_groups_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) , it 's only logical to assume a lot of those weapons find their way to the is and other radical islamist groups in the world . 
  that is a common argument used by people that know absolutely nothing about firearms . 
  you think disarming law abiding citizens all the while arming radical jihadists just a short boat/car ride away will make europe safer ? 
  no it 's not ... 
  not really when there are millions of illegal military firearms all over the balkans and eastern europe in general . 
  it 's not hard to get in your car , drive to the balkans / some former eastern european conflict zone in a few hours and bring a firearm back hidden in your car somewhere , it 's not like there are border checks in the schengen area anyway . 
  schengen is the problem . 
  not to mention all the illegal firearms and explosives coming from the middle-east and north africa just like all the refugees . 
  does that make his life more valuable than yours or mine ? 
  i believe i and everyone else have the same right to self-defence he does . 
  there are plenty of people who would love to kill me ( and you ) , just like they killed more than a hundred people in paris a few weeks ago . 
  you said :  frankly hunting should be illegal unless you 're doing it to survive . 
  i was responding to that . 
  not many places in europe look like they did 10 000 years ago , but northern europe does . 
  we have en extremely large moose population in finland that poses a very real danger to car traffic . 
  more than 1 500 so called `` moose crashes '' happen every year , in which people often lose their lives , which is why every year a large amount of moose hunting licenses is handed out by the government . 
  we also have wolf and bear populations that have to be managed so they do n't pose a threat to people or livestock . 
  this is why the government also hands out wolf and bear hunting licenses every year . 
  i can understand how hunting may seem `` obsolete '' or unneccessary to someone living in central europe where there are more lamp posts than trees , but it 's not like that everywhere in europe . 
  ( one ) of the reason ( s ) you do n't see french army famas 's used by terrorists is because there has n't been a war/armed conflict in france in a long time , unlike the balkans . 
  gun control goes out the window during a war or an armed conflict and guns get lost , said guns then usually find themselves in the black market . 
  clever ... 
  anyway , i 'm sure you realize where i was going with that ? 
  could you name some legal activities that you enjoy doing ? 
  i believe i ( and everyone else ) have the same right to self defence as he does . 
  if you do n't agree with that , then i suppose we can agree to disagree . 
  resort to insults when you have no more arguments , real classy . 
  i do n't see how his life is any more valuable than mine or that of anyone else really , despite of his current occupational choice . 
  so mr. cameron is entitled to security but the average law abiding citizen is not ? 
  which is precisely why gun control should be left to the individual nations instead of the eu like suggested by mr. cameron . 
  the ( fully automatic ) zastava m70 's used by the terrorists in paris were manufactured by zastava arms for the yugoslav people 's army and were lost during the numerous wars in the balkans in recent history , just like millions of other automatic firearms lost from warsaw pact armories immediately after the fall of the soviet union . 
   the terrorists weapons were all legal at some point though no , these firearms were never legal for civilian possession . 
  what if i told you that there are millions of europeans in possession of semi-automatic firearms for sports shooting and self-defence purposes and that they are almost never used in crime ? 
  what if i told you that banning legal semi-automatic firearms would have an unfathomably tiny effect on acquisition of firearms ( often fully automatic ) by terrorists and the ban would only punish millions of law abiding european citizens ? 
  what if i told you that semi-automatic firearms are often used in hunting by more than 7 million european citizens ? 
  what if i told you that swiss and finnish national security is greatly dependent on the possession of semi-automatic firearms by law abiding citizens after their military service ? 
  just because you have no need or do n't see a need for semi-automatic firearms does n't mean that that 's the case all over europe . 
  banning legal semi-automatic firearms eu wide in response to the paris attacks is like banning cars because some licenceless idiot drove over the speedlimit with a motorcycle . 
  i 'm sure mr. cameron still likes his private security guards armed ... the hypocrisy is real here . 
  how about no . 
  as bad as the refugee situation might be , it should not be used as an excuse to further federalize the eu . 
  eu is made up of sovereign states and you can not deploy an armed force into a member state if it does not ask for it . 
  that 's an invasion . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  this directive aims to accomplish the following : * ** ban of civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons in eu member countries ** * ** all permits have max 5 year duration , after that they have to be revised ** * signal and alarm weapons are included to firearms directive * common rules regarding markings on weapons and parts an deactivation * limitations to internet sales * align national databases and exchange of information the proposed directive can be read here : http://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/13965/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native there are ~ 670 000 legal gun owners in finland ( out of a population of 5.5 million ) and over 1.6 million legal firearms used for hunting , [ sports shooting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qasnaxfh_vs ) , [ reservist training ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_dinpq5jde ) ( 85 % of finnish men between the ages of 18-60 are army reservists and they make up ~ 97 % of the war time army ) and collecting . 
  this directive going through as it is now , would have an absolutely devastating impact on finnish national security . 
  every second ( 50 % of ) finnish households eat self hunted meat ( moose , deer and raindeer mostly ) . 
  hunting is an extremely popular and normal activity in finland , and has been for thousands of years . 
  in mainland europe hunting is usually something that rich people pay to do in national parks etc. 
  because mainland europe does n't have a similar culture when it comes to hunting or firearms in general .
