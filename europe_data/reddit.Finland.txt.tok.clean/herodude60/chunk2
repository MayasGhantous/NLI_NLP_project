  i have five years of experience pretending to understand your language . 
  the word for computer is `` tietokone . '', 
  tieto means knowledge and kone means machine so a computer is a knowledge machine . 
  if by phonetic you mean that our letter will aleays sound the same , then yes finnish is very phonetic . 
  finnish is very different from most european languages . 
  there is no way to make computer sound finnish . 
  but in some cases they do it , because fuck you that 's why . 
  a lot of scientific terms sound fine in finnish , but someone decided `` nah . 
  let 's just make up new words . '', 
  finnish usualy makes up new words . 
  all the time . 
  if it rained they 'll be on the streets . 
  using someone 's nationality as a reason for why someone is worse than you racism . 
  ( imagine if he was german an said that their products are worse because they 're jewish . ), 
  you called us baltic !!!!!!!, 
  we should burn you at the stake !!!!, 
  / jk finland is n't in scandinavia , but we are part of the nordic nations , which are scandinavia + finland , iceland , greenland and the faroe islands ( last two are part of denmark . 
  i just ca n't wait for the meme revolution . 
  they only banned memes with people in them . 
  so a meme made to make fun of the government that does ' t contain people is legal . 
  ahh yes !, 
  the biggest threat to russia . 
  some stereotypes : p.s i 'm not saying i agree with theese stereotypes all swedes are gay , obnoxious , assholes who think they are better than any other nationality . 
  estonians are just cheap labor force . 
  swedish speaking finns will always refuse to speak finnish . 
  all somalians do is breed . 
  all russians are violent . 
  edit : fixed a word, 
  norway and their oil . 
  well . 
  according to wikipedia in 2011 almost 60 % of russians supported the idea `` russia for russians '' . 
  over ** half ** of africans in ** moscow ** have experienced ** physical violence ** against them . 
  ( wow !, 
  just wow . ), 
  a lot of people still think that jews do the [ blood libel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_libel ) . 
  also a lot of russians have no problem saying racist , sexist , homophobic and xenophobic shit out loud . 
  ( source : russian relatives ), 
  ** according to our prime minister : ** apple destroyed nokia apple destroyed the paper industry apple destroyed the finnish economy, 
  no clue . 
  the only way to understand our government is to be our government . 
  it 's still compulsory . 
  the people do n't like it . 
  the government loves it . 
  yep . 
  you are one hundred percent right . 
  thats the way our school taught us . 
  swedes hate denmark so much they have to censor it with germany . 
  the swedish word for 7 is sju . 
  pronounced like shoe with a ` y ' sond ( like an u sound , but softer ) . 
  that picture !, 
  putins like : hey there baby . 
  you wan na fuck ? 
  ** greece : ** that 's it !, 
  i 'm going to asia !, 
  i did n't know that his dad had to be in power to get the title til . 
  actually it would be vladimir iii , since vladimir putin 's dad was also vladimir putin . 
  invading and dealing with that invasion are very stressful jobs . 
   lakes  sauna finland calling we want our stuff back . 
  now . 
  how the hell did he get elected ? 
  and finns have to wait untill 2017 even tho our parlament voted on it earler , because reasons . 
  well it 's a combination of a few things . 
  our economy heavily relied on nokia and the paper industry . 
  both of them crashed . 
  our previous government did n't do anything to even try to improve the economy . 
  actually they did n't do anything at all . 
  then our current government steps in with their austerity and cuts everything which makes the situation even worse . 
  we are still rich and our unemployment is n't that bad . 
  our economy has been stagnant for 6 years and it is only starting to show signs of recovery . 
  we could continue this way for a couple of years , but everyone already want 's atleast some growth . 
  event 0.1 % and i would be happy . 
  `` and the sick man of europe 2016 is ... finland again !, 
  that 's the second time in a row ! '', 
  for fucks sake !, 
  iceland probably would n't since they do n't have a military . 
  sweden . 
  it 's kinda funny that the website has language options for english , estonian , latvian , romanian , russian and ( thai ? 
  ) , but has no option for finnish . 
  flights to greece are also cheaper !, 
  they seem to check people with large bags . 
  at least i got checked while carrying my luggage , while visiting relatives a couple of months ago . 
  i mean that 's true . 
  9 years not enough education . 
  oh that 's why !, 
  we only have 9 nine years of compulsory education . 
  two cups ? 
  i drink that much in at breakfast . 
  i 'll usually drink one or two cups after school , depending on how tired i am . 
  urban areas overwhelmingly voted to join the eu . 
  and that ` genocide ' is saving kids from their often abusive russian parents , since physical punishment is considered acceptable by many russians . 
  the grant will be a coupon for five euro and message from the government `` spread your buttcheeks wide !, 
  this is only the beginning of our austerity program ! '', 
  that 's fair . 
  our churches are mostly heaps of brutalist trash so we do n't have to worry about that . 
  interesting . 
  what is the church usefull for ? 
  churches here are essentially community centers with some jesus mixed in . 
  i personally like the community center part , but do n't like the jesus part . 
  we do n't have separation of church and state either . 
  we have two state churches and all their members pay a curch tax .
