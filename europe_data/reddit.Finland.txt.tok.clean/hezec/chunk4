  still a lot faster than ferry , of course . 
  there are two options . 
  great britain ( * suur * = great + britannia ) or united kingdom ( * \u00fchend * = united , derived from * \u00fcks * = one + * kuning ( as ) * = king + * riik * = state , empire -- cf. 
  german * reich * ) . 
  estonian just spells compound words mostly without spaces . 
  it is . 
  i 've been tutoring international students at my university and our advice on the issue is `` they probably wo n't check , but if you want to get a job permit later you 'll be in trouble , and anyway it 's the law so please register '' . 
  you criminal !, 
  buffalo , not bufallo also , i remembered the capitalizations to be at different spots , but then realized that works too . 
  posted anyway for the misspelling . 
  try to study anything advanced in finland and you 'll have to speak english . 
  there is n't really a big market for finnish books about , say , applications of specific cryptographic methods . 
  and that market tends to consist of geeks who already learned english from surfing the internet as preteens . 
  \\* buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo . 
  thankfully spelling is the one thing that 's actually easy in finnish . 
  not really . 
  you 're clearly talking about ways to make apple pies , but half of it is so mangled it does n't really mean anything . 
  and they 've been doing it to africa for a couple of decades already so you can clearly see for yourself there 's no catch ... if you do n't count chinese companies essentially taking over a large part of your economy , anyway . 
   i do n't understand what motivates people to voluntarily attend pro-government ( or pro anything ) rallies pro-something is always anti-something else . 
  sometimes it 's good to make a point in showing that a vocal minority is just that and not actually a majority , even if it is n't actually necessary as such . 
  iirc , that 's something about `` the mute people '' , as in not speaking a slavic language . 
  germany has many names in different languages but i never knew italy has as well . 
   i loved reading all the names in polish !, 
  yeah ... 
  i get the rest but w\u0142ochy ? 
  what 's the etymology behind that ? 
  if i had to guess , it 'd be the micro states ( andorra , monaco , san marino , liechtenstein ) with rich residents buying apple products and never bothering to change the defaults . 
  remember that traveling also costs something within europe . 
  getting from spain to the cheap eastern european countries ( where you will want to go with that kind of budget ) and back , probably by train , might well set you back another 200 euro or so ( not sure exactly ) . 
  it 's not a huge cost for the distance covered but proportionally it does eat into your budget a fair bit . 
  i 'm assuming you 're comparing the cost to flight tickets ; if you can afford a little more , since it would after all be like a holiday trip , it 'll get more fun . 
  in any case , it 's definitely doable as long as you forgo any expensive entertainment . 
  finland is one of the most expensive countries in the world , but as a student i mostly manage with the 470 euro per month welfare . 
  room ( including electricity/water/heating / internet ) 250 + phone 20 + transit pass 50 = 320 for ` utilities ' . 
  subsidized weekday lunches are 2.60 per meal , so about 60 per month . 
  that still leaves 90 euros of ` free ' money ( paid by taxes , of course ) for other food , clothes , books , electronics , entertainment etc. 
  with savings from summer jobs and/or support from family it 's not bad at all . 
  same in finland . 
  it was decided before the euro was ever adopted as cash . 
  finnish 1c and 2c coins only exist as collector items sold directly by the mint . 
  ... pretty much how finnish works . 
  we just have a more limited set of sounds so transcribing english accurately is entirely impossible , as demonstrated by my example . 
  sounds occurring in native finnish words : a ( d ) e h i j k l m n ( \u014b ) o p r s t u v y \u00e4 \u00f6 ( d is only used for certain conjugations and \u014b is spelled as ng , so to keep things simple and slightly exaggerated i did n't use them above . ), 
  distinct additional sounds that sometimes occur in loan words : b f g \u0161 w z \u017e ( due to technical limitations , \u0161 and \u017e are often spelled sh and zh , but that goes against the principles of phonetic spelling and is discouraged . ), 
  english tends to mangle vowels so a/o is fair enough , but a big part of the stereotypical ` finnish ' accent is exactly that neither of the english pronunciations of ` th ' exists in finnish . 
  that 's why i left them out and you should probably do the same in estonian . 
  ( yes , i 'm very fun at parties . ), 
  since i like to do random things , i figured i 'd reply to my own post and do a s\u00e1mi ( northern ) version of the same sentences . 
  it 's actually much better suited for approximating english . 
  fini\u0161 spelli\u014b is uan of \u0111\u00f6 moor lo\u017eikal \u0167i\u014bs in \u0111is uoold . 
  its \u017east not rieli \u00e1plikabl tu meni a\u0111e l\u00e1\u014bui\u017eiis sins uii juus sou fjuu kanson\u00e1nts . 
  unless i 'm seriously mistaken about estonian pronunciation , you 're still doing it ` wrong ' . 
  \\* ools\u00f5u \\* tru \\* mii \\* staatid \\* vit \\* t\u00f5u or is ` th ' actually pronounced like \u00f0 or \u00fe in estonian ? 
  finnish spelling is one of the more logical things in this world . 
  it 's just not really applicable to many other languages since we use so few consonants . 
  excuse me : vinis spellin is van ov t\u00f6 moor lotsikal tins in tis v\u00f6\u00f6lt . 
  its tsast not rieli \u00e4plik\u00e4p\u00f6l tu meni ater l\u00e4nkvitsiis sins vii juus sou vjyy kanson\u00e4nts . 
  i 'm pretty sure in finland that 's the case only if it 's behind a lock or a door , in which case normal laws against trespassing apply . 
  otherwise it 's free for all , at least in practice . 
  ^ ( edit : damn autocorrect ), 
  why would it be ? 
  it 's in the trash . 
  the previous owner threw it away and now it 's in a public place anyone can access . 
  in helsinki there 's even a fb group dedicated to telling each other which places have these big bins at the time . 
  the finnish summer holiday is misplaced . 
  it starts on the saturday of week 22 ( which would be 31 may in 2014 ) and ends in mid-august . 
  each municipality can decide individually when the school year starts and when/if the shorter breaks are held , as long as there is a certain number of working days . 
  edit to add detail : officially the new school year starts on 1 august , but usually the first day of school is around the 15th . 
  the law mandates a ten-day christmas holiday , though usually it 's over two weeks from 22-23 december to 6 january ( epiphany ) or the following sunday . 
  most municipalities have a week or off or at least an extended weekend in october and february , plus a few extra days around easter besides the public holidays . 
  at university level it 's an entirely different matter , with the slacking off starting gradually from celebrations on 1 may ( vappu ) with june-august 99 % free and the new academic year starting in early september . 
  there 's a christmas break but no other real holidays . 
  also , what 's with the random order of the countries ? 
  i recall reading that the reindeer in lapland got too hazardous for human consumption after eating contaminated lichen . 
  probably had to be careful with berries and mushrooms as well , but nothing overly significant . 
  they are . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thalys ) :  divided up between sncf [ france ] ( 62 % ) , sncb/nmbs [ belgium ] ( 28 % ) , and deutsche bahn [ germany ] ( 10 % ), 
  got ta include south helsinki somewhere . 
  remember , everything is relative . 
  ** finland ** ( original credit to / u/keepfrgettngmypsswrd ) * a pejorative short list of the political parties of finland , ordered by the results of the 2015 parliamentary election * * centre party ( * keskusta * , 21 % ) : hillbilly party for plundering and pilfering farmers and land-owners * finns party ( * perussuomalaiset * , 18 % ) : natsional socialistische party for plebs who hate immigrants and the eu * national coalition party ( * kokoomus * , 18 % ) : the republican wing of finland for money-grubbers * social democratic party ( * sosialidemokraatit * , 17 % ) : diet soda ex-commies in bed with labor unions * green league ( * vihre\u00e4t * , 9 % ) : goddamn hippies and propellerheads , gay * left alliance ( * vasemmistoliitto * , 7 % ) : goddamn communist hippies , also gay * swedish people 's party ( * svenska folkpartiet * , 5 % ) : concerned with minority rights as long as long as minorities are understood to consist only of swedish-speakers * christian democrats ( * kristillisdemokraatit * , 4 % ) : mirthless fundamentalist lutheran christian yahoos , for people who want legislation to follow the bible \\ + a bunch of minor parties ( i.e.

  most likely it would be , if that was actually available somewhere . 
  added to dairy products , mostly . 
  so the rumors say . 
  remains to be seen if they 'll actually make anything themselves anymore or basically just license the brand . 
  i 'd definitely be interested in an actual android phone by nokia !, 
  not even close . 
  microsoft bought the mobile phone division which had been struggling for years , but nokia is much larger than that . 
  they seem to be focusing on network equipment now , as they bought out siemens ' share in their joint business some years ago and now there 's this merger . 
  the mapping/navigation division ( branded here ) is also fairly big but according to news , they 're selling that off for a few billion as well . 
  makes sense , since without the mobile phones they do n't personally have much use for it . 
  the `` new '' nokia is stronger than it has been in years . 
  perhaps just introducing himself with his full name at the start . 
  but then again , `` normal '' callers to this sort of shows generally go by their first name and hometown so he was just following convention . 
  basically the index describes how diverse the economy of a country is . 
  for instance , if they only get money ( no matter how much ) from selling oil , the complexity is very low . 
  but if some of the money comes from mining , some from manufacturing , some from banking , some from tourism , etc , the complexity is high . 
  the nordics are near the top of the list . 
  depends on many factors , such as the length and required clearance ( how big ships must fit through ) . 
  an important one is the consistency of the ground .
