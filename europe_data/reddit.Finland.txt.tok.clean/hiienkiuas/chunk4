  so russia is not being a scumbag here , it 's russia being russia . 
  i agree , the timber we get from russia could be replaced with baltic or finnish timber . 
  for some reason finnish forestry companies are n't prepared enough for trouble with russian trade even though there has been troubles constantly trough history . 
  then give it to me !, 
  i 'm no expert , but to my knowledge serbs were originally albanians and roma people who were gradually mixed with huns from hungary and turks from anatolia , and bulgars from east . 
  slavic language they adopted from bosnia but they use cyrillic alphabet because they hope to be part of russia . 
  in short , the serbian identity is made up . 
  strong air current cools your body as does low temperature . 
  5c with strong wind can feel colder than -5 c with no wind . 
  same thing with draft , being inside a house with 22c temperature and strong draft can feel same as 17c with no draft . 
  the cooling of air current will be even more effective if your clothes or hair are wet . 
  in worse case draft can lead to mild hypothermia if you do n't wear enough clothes but that would be the same as not wearing enough clothes in low temperature . 
  hundreds of years ago fear of draft was justified as people lacked winter clothing , houses were colder and freezing to death was a real possibility but today there is no real danger in drafts . 
  at least some parts are growing other than the southern coast . 
  but this subreddit is not multilingual , which was his point . 
  japan does n't have better relations to north korea than south korea . 
  there are many disputes between japan and south korea but at least south korean government does n't abduct japanese people . 
  super saiyajin nation lead by [ super aryan . 
  small amount of people with big amount of natural resources . 
  they have 3 % of population of sweden but produce about half of hydro power in sweden . 
   holocaust was caused by germans . 
   holocaust was caused by jews . 
  does n't always work . 
  either way someone with facial hair gets elected . 
  who / sp / here ? 
  it 's still real to me dammit !, 
  i 'll probably vote for our nordic neighbor , i really liked their song and that tear had me sold . 
  that would n't matter since most of them have already done their service . 
  remove \u0106evapi remove \u0107evapi you are worst slav you are the slav idiot you are the slav smell . 
  return to russia . 
  to our russia cousins you may come our contry . 
  you may live in the zoo ... . ahahahaha pkn alive numbr one # 1 in finland ... . fuck the serbia , . . fuckk ashol slavs no good i spit in the mouth eye of ur flag and contry . 
  pertti aliv and real strong wizard kill all the slav farm aminal with punk magic now we the finlan rule . 
  the juries are normies reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  usa has much bigger garages . 
  i think there needs to be a study made to see if there is a correlation with size of garages and startups . 
  probably not , since solar power is more efficient closer to equator . 
  best natural resources are not the most environmentally friendly . 
  if you tax coal , hydro , nuclear and sun with same amount , market will not use the most environmentally friendly technology . 
  taxes change market behavior and feed-in tariffs are like reverse taxes so there is no controversy in my opinion . 
  with gene sequencing we can measure divergence of genomes between different species . 
  that is a good measure of evolution in my opinion . 
  absolutely , and scientific careers should be more easily available helping them become ** gen ** tlemen ** o ** f ** ci ** ting and ** de ** duction . 
  it would be better to find a solution that could help minorities do better in their final exams . 
  you could call it `` finals solution for the russian minority '' . 
  as an enthusiastic connoisseur of japanese elf rape comic erotica i can tell you that not only do orcs have penises but they are also quite big . 
  in 2009 18,7 % of finnish men under 25 were unemployed compared to 12,7 % of finnish women . 
  i would n't be surprised if we have more women than men working in a few decades . 
  one sentence is n't enough . 
  crimea is and has always been russian . 
  europe should thank usa for spending billions of dollars on their defence . 
  european food sucks compared to american and asian food . 
  europe is racist for not taking enough immigrants from africa so they have to resort to dangerous travel across mediterranean sea . 
  turkey is european because istanbul is culturally one of the most important cities of europe . 
  europe is a dying continent . 
  europe should stop being a puppet of usa . 
  [ i was referring to the period when somalia did n't have a government . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_somalia_ ( 1991 % e2 % 80 % 932006 ) ), 
  i was n't referring somalia as anarchist state , you might have read between the lines . 
  i might be ignorant since i 've only read kropotkin but i have a feeling that / u/g99 is right about this subject . 
  what do you think is anarchist state ? 
  somalians have firsthand experience of how well anarchy has worked in real life . 
  i do n't think any of them would want sweden to become like somalia . 
  i think that dune franchise is to blame for inventing house harkonnen , which makes people think our surnames end in - nnen instead of - nen . 
  i agree . 
  the holocaust survivors got free lunch and were n't badly treated . 
  just because some celebrities next to them got better service would n't ruin their day , i 'm sure they 've experienced worse things in their lives . 
  there are more important issues for them than eating food from plastic bowl instead of porcelain . 
  i know they should n't run away from history but i do n't see why they would want to celebrate soviet history . 
  they should be neutral about it and world war 2 is more neutral than `` great patriotic war '' . 
  neither is hernia , if you wake up with a `` tyr\u00e4 '' you should consult a doctor and have it removed . 
  [ how did aristoteles and plato end up in novosibirsk ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/sanzio_01_plato_aristotle.jpg ), 
  if some english man who was with his girlfriend got beat up in finland i do n't think many brits would find it funny if i said he had it coming . 
  show some fucking respect . 
  if i think about something first in english and then in finnish and reach different outcomes each time , is n't that the same thing as having my thinking pattern heavily affected by language ? 
  you know what i meant , do n't be such a grammar nazi . 
  so that is the subreddit for grammer nazis . 
  today yahweh let me know about convergent evolution . 
   nato invaded yugoslavia just because they wanted to fuck with russia . 
  proof ? 
  russia did occupy large parts of finland in 1713-1721 and 1742-1743 so you 're not completely mistaken . 
  i would n't know how auroras without light pollution look like . 
  but most of these photos look too illuminated to be taken during night unless with longer exposure , especially the first photo . 
  i live 700km north of lithuania and have never seen northern lights . 
  or so i thought until i went to walk my dog just now and saw clear light pillars in the sky . 
  i think i 've mistaken northern lights for light pollution until now . 
  these photos exaggerate the view with very long exposure time . 
  i do n't think you can see those kind of lights unless you go north of arctic circle . 
  you have to keep in mind that any topic about gypsies will attract `` racially-aware '' people like flies . 
  saying that turks are white does n't go well with those kinds of people . 
  islam vs white europe is what they think . 
  eh , i ca n't tell dutch and turks apart . 
  both are light skinned brown haired people that can be found everywhere in southern europe . 
  russification , we need a strong nation . 
  in estonia-finland the languages would be roughly : 73 % finnish 14 % estonian 6 % russian 4 % swedish 3 % other languages estonian language would become a minority and there would be a possibility of it 's position being weakened in favor of finnish language . 
  i think most of us want close cooperation but having our own countries works the best . 
  join us on / r/spurdo / for many ebin finnish bear adventure comics . 
  when a man turns 50 in turkey , he goes to germany to open kebab restaurant . 
  yes , more women should be ceos so that the ratio of men and women would be around equal , but ceos are n't really a big part of workforce .
