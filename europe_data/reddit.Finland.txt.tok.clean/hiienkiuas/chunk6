  that is pretty much what average estonian does . 
  that must be the edgiest christmas tree i 've seen . 
  during the last 10 years , large amount of finnish schools have found out to have bad indoor air problems . 
  there has been kind of a hysteria and you can read about `` mold schools '' in papers all the time . 
  timber on the other hand has good reputation as building material since the wood allows air and moisture to travel trough it . 
  some people and experts in finland believe that the indoor problems are largely caused by usage of building materials that are made too compact to save heating costs but do n't allow moisture or air to move trough . 
  i think timber schools are more homely than concrete schools and we should have more of them . 
  i know , looks like pribalti fascist nazis are off to genocide the russian minority , again . 
  dissolution of soviet union was a mistake , keep nato out of russia 's sphere of influence . 
  just kidding . 
  happy independence day to latvia , with somewhat a shared history under swedish and russian rule i can say it is nice to have a nation that represents your people . 
  why has slovakia taken a lot of refugees from vietnam ? 
  norway used to be a big producer of timber in europe , the most common spruce is even called norway spruce in english . 
  luckily you found oil and now we no longer have to compete with norwegian mills as much as we did 100 years ago . 
  come on , you know who . 
  right , i 'm an idiot . 
  but it 's still very dishonest reporting . 
  who says united kingdom has had 13 or 15 cases each year in 2011-2013 . 
  it 's probably only one person with tb in each of those parts with high rate . 
  it 's like saying vatican has 2.27 popes per square mile . 
  then a researcher from antarctica joins the conversation . 
  belgium is n't know for cold weather . 
  iceland is warmer than finland and it is n't very cold here either . 
  maybe the people there want to remain a part of spain . 
  i agree , it 's good to have some genetic diversity . 
  without russians living there estonia would only have european dna .

  i do n't blame you , finnish humor is a joke .

  if you read wikipedia about pasteurization and cans , they 're as much french invention as pasta is italian . 
  you could even say that italian lazzaro spallanzani contributed as much to pasteurization as louis pasteur . 
  thank you , i think i 'll try [ this ] ( http://www.originalitaly.it/it/ricette/r-tagliatelle-al-ragu - ) and [ this ] ( http://www.originalitaly.it/it/ricette/r-pizza-monterosso ) to make some authentic italian food . 
  can you give some examples ? 
  i think pasta is more influential than anything that comes from france . 
   simonsen also points to a case which norway lost in the european court of human rights ( ecthr ) in 1996 , a case concerning the state 's taking over of children from parents . 
  in this case , a child was taken from its mother immediately after birth and was placed in a foster home . 
  when the case reached the court , the child had lived with its foster parents for 7 years , but the mother still won against norway . 
  her winning in the ecthr was , however , of little value to the mother , since the norwegian authorities after losing in strasbourg let the foster parents adopt the child and refused to follow up on the decision of the ecthr . 
  i think many people would take side of european human rights court before norwegian authorities . 
  i did a little searching and found [ a website that has number of universities in countries ] ( http://www.webometrics.info/en/node/54 ) and number of universities in top 100 , top 200 , top 500 and top 1000 . 
  us universities dominate the top 100 , but only 7 % of us universities are in top 1000 as opposed to united kingdom with 23 % or germany with 14 % of their universities ranked in top 1000 . 
  the site also says that over 2000 us universities are beyond the top 5000 mark . 
  eu has over 350 universities in top 1000 compared to us with 245 . 
  is average university better in us than in europe ? 
  i agree . 
  that is a problem in democracy , you have to listen to dumb people too . 
  saying that they 're dumb instead of explaining why they 're wrong is n't effective way of persuasion .

  brazil has n't been that strong in scientific research during the last 100 of years and neither has china . 
  there are probably other factors , i 'm no expert . 
  it can be biased against world outside of usa and western european countries . 
  my point was that it is n't biased in favor of usa , at least not strongly . 
  you can compare individual countries too , if you look at laureates per 10 million in france , german and usa , you see they are n't very different . 
  i agree , the situation is very different than a year ago . 
  [ if you count nobel laureates per capita , eu and usa have almost the same amount . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_nobel_laureates_per_capita ) during the last 100 of years usa and western europe were almost equal in level of scientific research so it 's not surprising . 
  china , india , japan and russia got into it later on and out of them only japan is on par with usa and western europe in regards of amount of scientific research in relation to population . 
  johan b\u00e4ckman is internationally respected human rights activist who fights against baltic and finnish fascism against russian minority . 
  i think you can trust him . 
  un budget has tripled in 30 years . 
  if the funding is cut 50 % it does n't mean that un ca n't function anymore . 
  and why would france walk away if they 're the ones who came up with this appeal ? 
  in reality china , russia and us are providing less than 30 % of un 's funding . 
  is this really a repost ? 
  i could n't find any other posts of this video in / r/europe .

   the communists form the most ` motivated ' group : they wake up every day at 6 am to jog around the site singing communist songs under the red banners . 
  i get a mental image of children in soviet pioneer uniforms jogging in a small formation . 
  i do n't think it has been in the news so much more . 
  people just post those news here in / r/europe more frequently especially now that there is nothing else major news to talk about other than brexit or russia . 
  they also constantly mention russia in usa election debate which helps to keep the topic of tensions with russia on the news .

  i know , i was talking about the deaths in concentration camps . 
  but i would like to know where you got the number of tens of thousands killed in soviet concentration camps . 
  there were from 1,6 to over 10 million deaths in soviet concentration camps and 4,3 million in nazi concentration camps . 
  how are they not comparable ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nazi_concentration_camps, 
   every human who died in a concentration camps even those who died in soviet concentration camps ? 
  and hitler was austrian . 
  therefore germany played no role in the holocaust . 
  i can believe that , except for the annexed kaliningrad that used to be part of germany . 
  i 'm not saying that russia should return it to germany , but that russia did n't leave from every place that was occupied like us did . 
  us gave full sovereignity back to japan and germany while russia annexed kaliningrad and kuril islands to itself from germany and japan . 
  there is no comparison .
