  this map shows none of those things . 
  you do n't understand what `` haplogroup '' means . 
  this is not a `` genetic map '' , this is a haplogroup map . 
  they are not particularly useful in determining genetic make up or similarities/differences between peoples . 
  using them in such a manner shows a fundamental misunderstanding . 
  moreover , the source is * eupedia * , which is is not exactly scientific . 
  it 's a mashup of actual information , assumptions and mislabelings . 
  just thought i 'd chime in , since i see these being posted all the time by people who do n't really seem to understand what they 're posting . 
  some are more and others less interested . 
  but i think overall , finland is well in touch with its folk traditions compared to most western countries . 
  obviously , deeper interest is relatively niche as anywhere else , but most people know much of the kalevala and consider our cultural traditions and mythology important and something worth protecting and researching further . 
  traditional folk music has also seen a sort of rise in popularity a few years ago , and there are some movements to `` reinvigorate '' the old religions . 
  [ here 's some kind of folk music mix .

  i hope they go through with the idea of building a tunnel under the sea between helsinki and tallinn . 
  imagine how much faster we could get our booze !, 
  i was n't even commenting on the article , but on the situation in sweden in general . 
  a lot of people here seem to just throw around buzzwords without really understanding them . 
  on message boards such as this , `` leftist '' has been warped into something not even remotely resembling left wing politics . 
  it 's just a general , all-purpose insult at this point . 
  used even by people who would realise they themselves are leftist if they knew anything about politics . 
  truly estonia is our greatest ally . 
  fair enough , but i do n't believe there exists a country so wealthy and peaceful that this should be a priority . 
  although i 'm guessing there was more to the story than just `` we want to go after pizzerias '' . 
   unless your country has bigger fish to fry , that 's certainly an interesting thing to investigate - and finland does n't exactly strike me as a troubled country . 
  i do n't know what kind of utopistic image you have of finland , but i 'm pretty sure we have bigger problems than cheap pizza . 
  indeed . 
  open borders will never work as long as there are large differences in wealth , politics and cultures between countries . 
  not only in europe , but the world . 
  turning everything into a grey mass only serves to bring everyone down as things are . 
  i 'm sure everyone agrees that it would be nice if we could all hold hands and sing songs and everyone could be wealthy and happy , but there is the issue of the real world . 
  the moral high ground will surely feel great after self-destruction . 
  watching what sweden is doing to itself is like watching a train wreck . 
  the worst part is , we 'll get spill over . 
  * why did finland ally with germany ? 
  * because the allies would n't help , as we were under attack from one of them . 
  you take what you can get . 
  both here in finland and in sweden , there is no reason to beg . 
  there is no need for it . 
  if you 're a citizen , you get enough money from the government to get by even if you do n't have a job . 
  if you 're not a citizen , you should n't be here begging in the first place . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  these people come here from poor countries to sit in street corners and get better pay than they would back home . 
  it 's very much organised . 
  giving money to them is enabling criminals . 
  frankly , i support banning begging . 
  true enough . 
  but i suppose concrete is more space-efficient . 
  for cities and stuff . 
  here in the north , wood is and always has been common . 
  only with modern technology and central heating has concrete/stone even become really viable . 
  i have been told by swedish friends that the story of the swedish flag comes from the ( debatable ) swedish crusade ( s ) into finland , where a golden cross appeared against the blue sky . 
  but i really do n't know . 
  i was about to post something similar from here in my hometown in finland !, 
  aurora has been active tonight . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  finland is a country at the edge of the eu , refugees have to travel through two dozen countries to get here , but they still get here by the thousands . 
  the only reason i see them not appearing at czech borders in ridiculous amounts is that czech rep does n't provide the same generous welfare system . 
  it 's certainly much easier to get there . 
  ** country : ** finland ** favourite neighbour : ** cheap estonian alcoholic beverages have done the most for me personally . 
  eesti it is . 
  ** least favourite neighbour : ** guess . 
   ** favourite ** finland ( no homo ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4wwqhodtyk no no homo in finland !, 
  finland and norway do n't really do much together . 
  norway to us is the nice neighbour you almost never see or hear from , who just minds their own business . 
  there is not much to say about them but nothing to complain about either . 
  finland probably is similar to them . 
  just as people where label everyone who supports immigration `` leftist '' and talks about `` leftists '' trying to run down their countries , when in reality it 's not a particularly leftist idea . 
  people here in finland even blame `` leftists '' for our current immigration numbers even though it 's all happened during right wing governments . 
  i do n't think i 've been to any finnish city or town that did n't have a street named after russia 's alexander ii , and another for mannerheim . 
  feels to me like it 's they who do it themselves . 
  all i hear on this site is people talking about `` the left '' as people who try to bring in more immigrants , and `` the right '' trying to stop it . 
  it 's as if one 's stance on immigration actually has any kind of relevance to left or right . 
  it was just the one 19 year old guy who `` did it on a whim '' . 
  this is a very misinformed story , and it 's quite late . 
  you 're the thick one here . 
  let me spell it out for you . 
  the argument is that these immigrants commit considerably more crime . 
  we 're not arguing about * why * they do it . 
  just that they do . 
  the fact remains that they * are * mostly young men , so what their wives and daughters at home would do is not at all relevant . 
  furthermore , comparing them to men of the native population , they still commit far , far , far more crime , particularly of the violent kind as i said . 
  for the third time , that is entirely irrelevant . 
  if they commit more violent crime , they commit more violent crime . 
  that is literally the argument . 
  excuses do n't actually address the argument at all . 
  furthermore , did you think about the numbers for a moment ? 
  fifteen times more than natives . 
  fifteen . 
  that is absurdly high . 
  a great and unique heritage is something to be proud of . 
  i ca n't even begin to comprehend the kind of mental gymnastics that are required to twist it into a negative . 
  is he actually implying `` finno-ugric '' is some kind of insult ? 
  as for `` hickville '' , i honestly could not care less . 
  if we are to be branded as backwards forest folk , then at least it 's because we had some spine . 
  it 's as if some people think our country 's reputation among certain kinds of people is more important than its well-being . 
  and only the un cared . 
   immigrants have a much higher proportion of young men than natives . 
  immigrants are immigrants . 
  you 're not addressing the argument , you 're making excuses .
