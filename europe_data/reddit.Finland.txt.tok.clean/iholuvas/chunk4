  we do n't see it as a recommendation like a lot of current nato members , but a responsibility , and it would take a toll financially . 
  we would not join to freeload . 
  a united european army would be the biggest international player after the us . . 
   europe is a joke military europe is a continent , not a military . 
  yeah , this kind of thing has been going on here in finland too . 
  `` nato support soars at an all time high of ... 22 % ... '', 
  and you 'd probably be right . 
  but the legacy of the finnish war would 've been meaningless had the other two events happened in a different way . 
  the finns party is considerably more leftist than ukip . 
  they are socially conservative but economically leftist . 
  that 's why i called them center-left earlier , though i guess it 's not quite correct either . 
  they are actually originally an offshoot of the center party , with more conservative versions of more or less the same social values , and are more left with their economic policies . 
  so , i think it 's hard to define them in terms of right or left , and it 's more than a bit dishonest to call them `` far right '' . 
  edit : populist they certainly are , however . 
  what `` far right '' ? 
  the upcoming three party government is almost exactly in the middle of the political spectrum . 
  centre party being the biggest , and the other two being centre-right and centre-left . 
  edit : finns party being centre-left, 
  used to be huge , is still bigger than in most of the world . 
  quite a lot of metal bars , festivals and venues . 
  no , you 've been saying finnish army is `` inferior '' and could n't stand up to denmark . 
  you 've got a narrow view and are comparing two armies with very different conditions and goals only looking at it from one side . 
  the finnish army is the best army in the world at defending finland on finnish soil , and that 's really all it concerns itself with . 
  the danish army has no reasonable outside threat so it can cut down on its national defence in favour of international operations . 
  in a war between finland and denmark the side on the offense would inevitably lose , because finland does not have the logistics for offensive warfare and denmark does not have the power to attack finland and match its armed forces in conventional warfare . 
  it 's a meaningless argument . 
  narrowed it down to 3 things : * ** the finnish war ** and its results , 1809 the autonomous grand duchy of finland became part of the russian empire . 
  without this , finland in its modern form certainly could n't exist . 
  it gave way to finnish nationalism among other things . 
  * declaration of ** independence ** and white victory in the ** civil war ** , 1917 should be obvious why independence is significant . 
  * ** world war ii ** independence was succesfully defended against all odds . 
  i 'm not including anything prior to the 19th century because i think most of the events leading up to the grand duchy phase were more or less inevitable in some form and the end result would n't have been very different . 
  i think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of nordic defence . 
  denmark and finland are not at war with each other nor will we ever engage in offensive warfare , so all this is meaningless . 
  it 's called the defence force because its only job is national defence , we do n't care about what other countries get up to because we do n't tend to start wars . 
  the mozzies only like lapland and some areas that are close to water , with some luck you can avoid them for the most part . 
  but you 're right , they are awful . 
  for people in more southern countries ( that 's 99 % of people in the world ) a real arctic winter has some exotic things to offer , such as vast amounts of snowy landscape and aurora borealis . 
  but i will never understand people who come up here for a city holiday in the winter . 
  the snow is just gray mush due to all the traffic , people are indoors , there are very few outdoor activities available other than ice skating and stuff . 
  summer is fantastic in this country so tourists who only come to see the winter are missing out , i think . 
  `` santa claus village '' in rovaniemi , it 's a tourist trap of the worst kind and probably not worth it unless you 're super into all the cheesy christmas stuff . 
  there 's lots of cool stuff to see in northern finland if you 're looking for a nature holiday , so do something else . 
  everything else is pretty good . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  without a doubt [ jean sibelius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ) . 
   but now that the finns are going to stop speaking swedish what do you mean ? 
  our swedish speaking minority was never much bigger than it is now , around 5-6 % . 
  to be fair us finns do n't tend to think about denmark at all . 
  maybe as an extension of northern germany . 
  but we like germany , so it 's cool . 
  sounds just like the conscription dodging morons here in finland who believe russia has a death star and a billion terminator units and super spetsnaz that will roll over everything within hours . 
  that somehow we should just give up on national defence altogether and spread our ass cheeks . 
  if our grandparents had that sort of pathetic defeatist mentality back in the day we would 've fallen behind the iron curtain . 
  we were in a much shittier position then than we are now and the same goes for the baltics . 
  long enough . 
  we nordics definitely would n't just stand by and watch estonia get invaded without getting involved , the eu in general would have to do something due to the defense clause and then there 's of course nato . 
  they have friends for the foreseable future . 
  that is all one can expect . 
   face it , estonia 's army will not be very useful in case full blown attack from russia , nor will it last long . 
  though , could probably defend against latvia  they do n't need to take on russia alone because they have friends . 
  oddly satisfying to look at . 
   russia has annexed crimea , wages a war in ukraine , violates its neighbours ' territories routinely ... but nato is the one pushing for war ? 
  they are * both * pushing for war . 
  more importantly , any nato conflict would also become our conflict , and being part of nato would mean with 100 % certainty that finland would be the site of that conflict . 
  we would invite war into our own land , precisely because of our geographical position . 
   as for finland , we 're not militarily allied , we have no guarantees of anything . 
  the eu has no army , all it can do is write an angry letter . 
  the eu has a mutual defence clause , and you would have to be very naive to think other eu countries would just watch one of the eu 's highest net contributors get invaded without doing anything . 
  and what guarantee do we really have that nato would come to our aid ? 
  about the same as that of eu . 
   if you think the nordics are going to help us , look at the map , and look at history . 
  we have no buffer zone . 
  we are the buffer . 
  we are the first and last line of defence , it is in the interests of all nordics ( excluding perhaps iceland ) that russia stops at finland 's border . 
  which is why we 're increasing military cooperation in the first place - if finland falls , what hope do the rest of them really have after that ? 
   regardless , military threat is not the first concern here . 
  the first concern is finlandization and return to a new cold war situation in which moscow calls the shots in helsinki . 
  and jews did 9/11 right ? 
  this is not the cold war . 
  if anything nato would push us towards war . 
  and finland would not be alone regardless , we have the nordics and the eu . 
  and over 70 years of preparation . 
  you are naive . 
   how languages are taught needs to be drastically revised , it 's not acceptable that people are not able to communicate in a language after spending 6-12 years studying it !, 
  i 'm pretty sure this has less to do with quality of teaching and more to do with the unwillingness of the students . 
  same here , although if the person is living here permanently then obviously we do expect them to learn the language . 
  there are some anglos who have settled here and do n't bother to learn finnish because they can get by with english , which is understandably seen as quite arrogant . 
  and while you certainly can get by with english , your experience in the country is very different and you 'll never really understand the local culture and society . 
   now , in comes someone who does n't speak any nordic language . 
  is it fair to the rest of the room to have to be forced to change to english because of this person ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  so what ? 
   imagine yourself as a scandinavian here , would you feel that this person is as close to you and your culture as someone you can speak your own language with ? 
  does it matter ? 
  they do n't speak finnish either . 
  besides as i said , no one 's removing swedish from finland , that 's not even what we 're talking about . 
   i believe quite a few of those opposed to the mandatory swedish in schools misses the point that the language is not there to cater the fennoswedes of finland . 
  the language is there to bridge the gap between finland and the rest of the nordic countries . 
  first off , that 's bullshit .
