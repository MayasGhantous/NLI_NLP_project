  we have many hills , they just end before becoming mountains . 
  sounds like you really loved that lidl . 
  it 's for international attention and awareness , i 'm guessing . 
  nothing at all , i guess . 
  most of the country is forest and lakes , and even the cities are very quiet by international standards . 
  many foreign friends have described helsinki as the most quiet capital city they 've ever been to . 
  not on the same level though . 
  almost everything built in the 60s-70s is soul-crushingly ugly , nowadays it 's more hit-and-miss . 
   they 're usually relics from the 60s and 70s that have long out stayed their welcome . 
  same here !, 
  apparently someone in the 60 's decided that from now on , all buildings should be some kind of concrete blocks . 
  it took 20 years for them to figure out that actually , they look exceptionally ugly and nobody likes them . 
  so we still have some of those around , all build around that time . 
   the finnish navy is n't exactly one to rule the oceans . 
  i 'm sure it ca n't be that hard . 
  give me a bottle of kossu and a rowboat , i 'll see what i can do . 
  i have n't run into it myself , but that must suck . 
  finnair is expensive but reliable . 
  ** pros : ** quality of life , vast and beautiful nature along with universal freedom to roam , endless summer days with tons of festivals and events , and snowy winters with all the activities that come with it , sensible society with relatively low corruption , low population density ** cons : ** sometimes overwhelming bureocracy , very high cost of living , it 's basically almost always dark for half the year , and we could have better travel connections to the rest of europe . 
  the same is true for all sufferers of genetic diseases and defects , then . 
  and how about people who do n't want to reproduce , or ca n't ? 
  i do n't really think this argument holds water . 
  incest is a strange issue . 
  when i think about it , it somewhat repulses me . . 
  i wonder if this is a cultural thing with my upbringing or something more inherent . 
  but i ca n't honestly justify it being illegal from an ideological point of view . 
  that 's the one !, 
  we have the special snowflake thing in common more often than not : ) i spent a year in cardiff as a student years ago , you have a lovely country . 
  people tried to teach me some welsh but i ca n't for the life of me remember . . something about coffee ? 
  haha . 
  i 've only heard of `` brexit '' on r/europe so i guess it 's not really newsworthy in finland . 
  maybe i 've just managed to miss it if it has been on the news . 
  in any case , have n't heard anyone in real life or online mention it either so it does n't seem to be on people 's minds . 
  personally , i have mixed feelings . 
  i 'm not too keen on the eu myself so if the uk were to leave , that would create an interesting situation , where some other countries ( such as finland ) might consider it as well . 
  on the other hand , if we are fully committing to this project it 's going to be a shame losing another net contributor , it 'll put more weight on the rest of us . 
  as far as the uk itself , my opinion has n't changed at all . 
  i was on student exchange in cardiff , i generally like britain and the uk . 
  we probably have more common words with swedish and proto-germanic than hungarian , the similarities really come from grammatical structures and such . 
  do n't forget our languages evolved in different conditions , the split happening thousands ( possibly even 20000 or more ) years ago , with different influences and without much interaction with each other . 
  since there are so few finno-ugric languages it 's easy to mistakenly think they 're very closely related , but the relation is pretty archaic . 
  fair enough , although i would argue any country 's landscape would seem a bit boring if you just came from norway and only stick to the highway ;-), 
  a boring country is a good country if you ask me . 
  and it 's not like there is n't anything to do , you just need to know people/do some research first . 
  i wo n't argue with you because it 's a subjective thing , but i 'd like to hear what you were looking for in the first place if all you found was heavy forest coverage . 
  i 'm okay with our current population numbers to be honest . 
  could 've gone for some `` pepsi max '' right now . 
  i guess you did n't know this , but back then finland * was * sweden . 
  those wars were fought here or in russia . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but from your wording it sounded to me like you were saying they 've just been passing through here . 
  which they certainly have not . 
  one day , i just walked outside like normal , got hit by the cold air , thought `` holy balls what the fuck '' and went back inside to dress properly . 
  it basically went from -5 c to -28 c overnight . 
  and then a few weeks later , it got almost 30 degrees warmer , also overnight . 
  i do n't really think cold is ever an issue with modern technology . 
  of course , i 'm speaking as someone who never experienced a siberian winter ( my coldest here in finland was -44 c ) , but i do n't think i 've ever cared much about cold . 
  if you have good heating in your house and wear good clothes in layers , the cold wo n't bother you . 
  the problem with winter is the unpredictable weather and constant darkness . 
  it 's fine for a visit but not seeing the sun for months is a bit annoying . 
   being the passing country for the russian army when did that happen ? 
  slightly above the european average the last time i checked . 
  fennoswedes are a bit special in some ways anyway , in that they are almost all ethnically finnish families that just switched languages a few centuries ago to move up on the social ladder . 
  or are you perhaps talking about actual swedes living here ? 
  they certainly are not finns . 
   i 'm surprised a finn would subscribe to such a russian concept as ethnic nationalism . 
  i feel like since you keep bringing this up so vehemently , there 's been some kind of misunderstanding . 
  i did n't say you need to be a finn to be a finnish citizen , in fact i said the opposite . 
  to be a citizen of finland you just need to integrate and live here . 
  but i was never talking about finland as a country in the first place , i was talking about * finns * as a people , in this land . 
  countries come and go , the people and their culture continues on . 
   you 're conflating nationhood with ethnicity . 
  i think you 're a bit obsessed with nationhood . 
  i always was and still am talking about the history of * the finnish people * . 
  as it happens , the history of finland is the history of the finnish people . 
  that is why in this discussion i do n't consider it relevant at all how old the modern state of finland is . 
   you may be ethnically a finn , but of course you can be a brit . 
  i disagree . 
  one might as well become a horse by living in a stable . 
  it 's like you assign an inherent value to being a brit or being a finn , when it 's just a descriptor . 
  hah , okay , i expected this . 
  what 's racist about calling a chicken a chicken ? 
  you can be a finnish citizen no matter where you 're from , but it does n't make you a finn . 
  the same way i can move to britain , but i 'll always be a finn in britain . 
  there is no inherent value to it , it just is . 
  and what a convoluted and entirely irrelevant point it ended up being . 
  a nation is its people , and the people of this nation are certainly ethnic finns . 
  it is by our culture , customs and history that finland exists as it does . 
  it does not matter what you call the country when the people are the same , that 's just arguing semantics to shift the discussion from its original point - which in this case was merely that * we * ( finns ) have lived next to russia ( or back in the day , novgorod ) ever since it came to be . 
  * we * ( finns ) under our many names in the past have fought russians in their many iterations a good number of times , but almost exclusively in self-defense . 
  the people , the culture , are a continuum , though various things have shaped them over the centuries . 
  therefore , we can expect that we know russians , and they know us , and with this historical perspective in mind adding to the political realities of our modern age , we can assume that they know us increasing our defense does not mean we 're preparing to start a war . 
  oh , and modern finland is 100 years old , not 80 . 
  does that satisfy you ? 
  are there other semantic issues you have and wish to address ? 
  if you have a point , please make it . 
  is this a trick question ? 
  it is not at all . 
  we 've lived here , we 've had a military ( or several ) under different names , and their doctrine has n't significantly changed . 
  i do n't get it . 
  finnish people have lived and fought here far longer than there have been nations .
