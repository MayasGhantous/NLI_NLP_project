both taken , i 'm afraid . 
  san marino has the . sm , and soviet union took the . su country domain . 
  incidetally , the russian separatists in ukraine use the old . su domain in on their novorussija `` news site '' . 
  cocksuckers . 
  it is , it has a fairly unusual bunker-like design . 
  a pretty bunker . 
  this summer a couple of travelers asked me the way to `` the rock church '' . 
  took [ me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9sifqh9.jpg ) a while to realise they did n't mean some heavy metal venue , but this church . 
  it appears it is n't ebola , but possibly malaria . 
  ok , cheers !, 
  yes , i actually ended up on this wiki about polish expansion attempts via a page about the darien scheme . 
  interesting stuff . 
  and rather sad , too . 
  ah yes , their story is intriguing !, 
   \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa gorzka i 'll have to try it sometime . 
  is it close to zubr\u00f3wka ? 
  such is life . 
  i know !, 
  it 's as if it was just given to us . 
  absolutely no effort level . 
  bless their hearts . 
  ( i know , coming from a country all too new for this colonization game . ), 
  i posted this because i did n't have any idea that poland ever attempted to acquire colonies . 
  actually i ended up on that wikipedia page somehow via [ darien scheme ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/darien_scheme ) , the unsuccessful scottish expansion scheme , that took place a couple of centuries earlier . 
  yeah , sounds like something from asterix adventures . 
  `` semigallia '' is a great name . 
  i 'm fascinated of these old nations and almost disappeared or assimilated people . 
  [ livonians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_people ) are one of these . 
  only a couple of hundred ethnic livonians are left . 
  that 's fantastic use of language !,

  good call , i must have gotten the wrong idea somewhere . 
  . io cctld ( country code top level domain ) is a country code for * british indian ocean territory * . 
  virtually no one lives there and . io can be freely registered by anyone . 
  it 's seen as generic tld , often used in domain hacks , such as * aud.io * . 
  i do n't know if * meduza.io * holds any meaning in that form . 
  perhaps it 's a metaphor for being forced to report from abroad . 
  interestingly , the russian separatists in ukraine have decided to use the old soviet union cctld , . su in their [ novorussia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_state_of_novorossiya ) `` news site '' . 
  i 've just res tagged you as `` grand douchy '' . 
  i 'm actually traitor as a finn because i only drink a few cups a month . 
  i 'm always been a tea drinker . 
  btw , i understand that , apart from the nordics , the dutch are one of the few people who consume salmiak in any significant amounts . 
  i wonder who consumes the most . 
  earlier this year there were some news claiming that the dutch would have passed us in coffee consumption . 
  here 's one : http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/here-are-the-countries-that-drink-the-most-coffee-the-us-isnt-in-the-top-10/283100/,

  maybe because you guys drink [ herbata instead of tea or caj ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wduwusp.jpg ) . 
   sven mikser you have a norwegian dj as a minister of defense ? 
  i 'm glad you liked it . 
  good article . 
  they really seem to handle their wealth well . 
   the fund , worth about $ 800bn ( # 483bn ) , owns 1 % of the entire world 's stocks , and is big enough to make every citizen a millionaire in the country 's currency , the kroner . 
  in effect , it is a giant savings account . 
  here 's an interesting ft ( paywall or reg . 
  possibility ) article froma few years back about how it all started : [ `` the iraqi who saved norway from oil . 
  here 's a tl ; dr : * hungary pm orban told his ambassadors monday he plans to build an eu coalition to stop sanctions against russia . 
  `` we will have to seek the company of those eu member states who are interested in slowing and stopping this separation process , '' he said , afp reports . 
  ... made of nazi gold . 
  very good !, 
  if finland would have been mentioned in the original joke , or indeed in this additional joke to the joke , finland would have asked what did the others thought about their depiction . 
  then again , and as per usual , we were n't mentioned , so there 's really no point even to think about the whole thing . 
  might as well have a drink .

  exactly . 
  this comment needs to be on top . 
  thanks , but i could n't find the pertinent info in the pdf , which was :  there was a study made that people in finland with a licence to carry are significantly less likely to be involved in a violent crime or any criminal act than people without one . 
  no , a different guy . 
  i 'm pretty old already , and i use live ammo . 
  true . 
  i think i forgot to warn about the wild father christmases .

  good point , this actually makes me feel a bit stabby ... 
  no , no . 
  it 's the elves that do the killing . 
  with their sharp pointy teeth . 
  yes , that 's what i thought it was about at first . 
  i was n't being sarcastic , your comment cleared the meaning of the infographic . 
  thanks for finding out that very crucial point . 
  headline from a redditor : http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/28qkm6/today_an_american_exchange_student_got_stuck_in_a/cidiiz3 the top comment in that thread is very good , too . 
  obese and smokers are actually less of a financial burden to society than healthy people because they die earlier .

   i 'm surprised to see that finland ranks lower than us . 
  their school system is supposedly great !, 
  i suspect that this data was a result of a poll , and not a test . 
  and my gut feeling is that many finns will underestimate their language skills when asked . 
  hell , many of us do n't even like to have a conversation in finnish . 
   it 's such a simple solution and it makes such a difference for the people that collect cans which really makes you wonder why it it does n't exist in other countries . 
  maybe other countries do n't care enough about people who collect cans ... or maybe we just have n't given this enough thought . 
  or see it as a problem at all . 
  i now usually leave an empty can or a bottle beside a trash can ... and then the wind can blow it on the street . 
  same thing here on the machines , you can donate the money , as well . 
  i remember drinking * afri-cola * here ( finland ) in the '70s . 
  i think it was sporadically available in the '90s , as well .
