  i do n't have to disprove anything for you . 
  if a news site spouts shit for bigots ' entertainment and righteous indignation , they lose all the credibility . 
  `` lidl less conversation , lidl more sewing . '', 
  shit `` news '' site citing a shit source . 
  no credibility whatsoever .

  geezers need excitement , if their lives do n't provide them this they incite violence . 
  or barbershop . 
  indeed . 
  similar case in finland from a few months back : [ `` iraqis ' arrest in finland highlights difficulties in prosecuting distant crimes '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/world/europe/finland-iraq-refugees-isis.html?_r=0 ) ( also nyt article ), 
  is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nav1ygf.jpg?1 ) one of yours ? 
  edit : nah , it appears to be a german sub . 
  i wonder if they will find any modern statues in the wreck . 
  the swedes did , when they raised the vasa in 1961 . 
   many of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered , but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell . 
  ** among the best known of these was a statue of 20th-century finnish runner paavo nurmi , which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of helsinki university of technology the night before the final lift . 
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_%28ship%29#finds, 
  good summary . 
  i noticed they just published an english version , as well . 
  maybe take that comment with a grain of salt then . 
  sweden has n't actually deported probably more than a few hundred last year . 
  edit : that is , if the said asylum applicants are actually taken out of the country . 
  in practice , denying an application does n't equal physical deportation . 
  lot of them just disappear from the authorities . 
  local news is for local people , we 'll have no trouble here !, 
  my pleasure !, 
   break into the nordic countries . 
  your [ forest situation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gd3lfrg.png ) is certainly at nordic levels already . 
  these numbers look much more plausible compared to [ this map ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lxbfbpf.jpg ) from a month ago where 90 % of both norway 's and netherlands 's citizens were supposedly english speakers . 
  comments : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/413or7/percentage_of_english_speakers_by_country/ i get that these measure different things , but i felt those first numbers were really dubious . 
  hippopotus , the leader of the watery hippocracy . 
  aww , that 's unfortunate . 
  although , when talking about new music , i can see problems arising when audience do n't know what to expect or do n't care about the music that is being performed . 
  i have experienced this personally . 
  when i was young there was this girl who used to invite me to all kinds of avant garde concerts , and one time i had leave the room when i just was n't unable to hold my mirth . 
  i was able to exit fairly quietly , soon followed by another rube boyfriend . 
  we laughed our asses off on the sidewalk . 
  ca n't remember the piece anymore , but i had two pianists that were occasionally walking about on corn flakes they had spread on the stage . 
  i 'm happy to report that this incident did n't ruin '' [ difficult ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helikopter-streichquartett ) '' music for me , and i do listen steve reich et al. 
  occasionally . 
  here 's one of my favourite pieces , where audience listens lying down on the floor : [ canto ostinato ` ligconcert \u2122 by sandra & jeroen van veen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpxw6_joifi ), 
  `` fart feuds erupt when a gypsy clan takes over air supremacy '' . 
  people keep posting that unchr page that shows some estimates of people arriving on just one route , but the numbers recorded in countries ' authrities are totally different . 
  indeed . 
  run , forrest , run !, 
  it 's about the same here in finland . 
  less than 5 % ( the number varies depending on the source ) of our forests are in natural state . 
  apparently ireland is the only country ( besides uk ) that still have the free super saver delivery option . 
  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeid=1204872 around two years ago they just pulled that option for other countries . 
  not much in the way of explanation or nothing . 
  i was n't the only one that thought that it was handled badly . 
  i 'd been happy if they 'd tripled the minimum purchase , and if they 'd excluded stuff that is especially costly to ship . 
  i used to buy books , clothes and other stuff on monthly basis , but the high shipping fees made it very unattractive to me . 
  just checked that the cheapest shipping for two paperbacks to finland would cost # 8.72 . 
  ... and possibly devoid of data centers, 
  i 'm still angry at them for cancelling the free shipping to most eu countries . 
  have n't ordered anything after that . 
  looks interesting , thanks . 
  i 've already seen the rubberbandits version . 
  i 'd bet the term comes from the swedish * sk\u00e4ggbarn * . 
  cheers . 
  yeah it 's hard to fix an over-saturated photo . 
  too many extra colours that were n't originally there . 
  that 's fantastic !, 
  do you know if there are any special rules concerning the oak , like what happens if the ball gets stuck on the tree ? 
  can you pass via the trunk ? 
  can you hang a bad ref from it ? 
  wan na turn down the saturation ? 
  a russian guy sums up finland ? 
  now i 'm feelink stabby . 
  indeed . 
  obviously , i was being sarcastic . 
  yep , learned this from * borgen * . 
  not counting when they go back on holidays , of course . 
  i 'm sorry for your loss . 
  i understand that the somali immigrants that we receive tend to stay here in finland . 
  they are our third largest immigrant group after russians and estonians . 
  maybe perform fellatio on yourself to help with the boredom . 
  more estonian bear photos like in the article : http://blog.moment.ee/tag/ursus-arctos i like bears . 
  i think the finns enjoy their daily righteous indignation served by the yellow press as much as the next european , but i guess that 's not really what you asked . 
  there are people who are easily offended , though . 
  there 's now even a finnish neologism , `` mielens\u00e4pahoittaja '' , for a type of person who is easily and constantly offended by most everything . 
  the word has a sort of disparaging connotation and suggests that the person may induce this state him/herself . 
  rather than bringing up lawsuits or organising demos , they just have to let everyone know they are offended and write letters of complaint and perhaps starts social media campaigns . 
  of course , all that `` safe space '' bullshit may start to spread here , too . 
  who knows . 
  kadaververwertungsanstalt gmbh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_corpse_factory, 
  yeah , it 's odd . 
  i guess it might be laziness rather than a coordinated thing . 
  i knew one of them would edit that out . 
  i do n't think `` some have likened ... '' has a place in serious news reporting . 
  if you quote someone , i want know who said it . 
  at the moment google gives [ over forty pages of results of that same soundbite ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=%22some+have+likened+the+danish+proposals+to+the+confiscation+of+gold+and+other+valuables+from+jews+by+the+nazis+during+the+holocaust.%22&amp;biw=1177&amp;bih=708&amp;tbas=0&amp;noj=1&amp;tbs=qdr:w&amp;ei=gfeqvtgqommksahngy2wcw&amp;start=433&amp;sa=n&amp;filter=0 ) . 
  as far as i can see no one knows who these `` some '' are . 
  heh , i was looking for that !, 
  there 's also a fine '80s doco about these films : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_atomic_cafe, 
  yeah , i certainly understand it 's a gimmick . 
  what i kinda meant that it would be interesting to know who started it around two days ago . 
  google gives us 26 pages of results on that quote verbatim : https://www.google.fi/search?q=%22some+have+likened+the+danish+proposals+to+the+confiscation+of+gold+and+other+valuables+from+jews+by+the+nazis+during+the+holocaust.%22&amp;biw=1177&amp;bih=707&amp;tbas=0&amp;noj=1&amp;tbs=qdr:w&amp;ei=mlepvqrpmsirswgqrat4bg&amp;start=243&amp;sa=n&amp;filter=0 my point is that it may not be just bias , but laziness . 
  and funnily enough , [ so is the guardian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htvnhke.png ) .
