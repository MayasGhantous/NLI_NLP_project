  i 'd like to know who the `` some '' are the media is quoting . 
  oddly , this [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35425735 ) finishes with exactly the same two paragraphs :  in neighbouring denmark , meanwhile , the government this week approved legislation to seize the valuables of refugees in the hope of limiting the influx of migrants . 
   some have likened the danish proposals to the confiscation of gold and other valuables from jews by the nazis during the holocaust . 
  it has n't been made clear who originally made this comparison that many media sources quote . 
  personally , i generally have liked guardian 's reporting ( except for some of their rabid op-ed pieces ) but their stuff on the eu migrant crisis seems to be really off - edit : [ here 's a screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htvnhke.png ) in case the one who copied the other decides to alter their article . 
  it 's now on bbc : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35425735, 
  i might have . 
  like i said , those were `` related '' pages from the rotherham wiki . 
  yeah , you 'd think those other cases would have been reported even here in finland , but if they are not even covered locally ... 
  similar apologism is prevalent is in other countries , too . 
  [ the swedish police ca n't even mention criminals ethnicity anymore ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swedish-police-are-not-allowed-to-give-descriptions-of-alleged-criminals-so-as-not-to-sound-racist-a6810311.html ) and they do n't have any published statistics on how many criminals are foreigners . 
  all in fear of sounding racist . 
  it 's not quite as bad in finland , but there 's still a good amount of whitewash and blame to go around towards the original population . 
  it 's absurd . 
  this whole thing is absolutely unreal . 
  i 'd read about the rotherham gang before , but had no idea that there are many more similar child molester gangs where all perpetrators are muslims or of muslim heritage , and all the victims are white . 
  just related links from the rotherham gang wiki : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telford_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peterborough_sex_abuse_case * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aylesbury_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keighley_sex_gang, 
  nits has an album called * [ alankomaat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kevmact.jpg ) * . 
  country names in the grand ole opry . 
  gud point . 
  i suspect that this is one of the main reasons for lower numbers in germany , italy , spain etc. 
  certainly possible . 
  also , swedish is compulsory for finnish speakers ( and finnish for swedish speakers ) , and those who choose it as their first language , start english ( or some other language ) a year ( or two ? ), 
  later . 
  although i believe that around 90 % of finns start with english as their first foreign language . 
  i just find norway 's 90 % a bit dubious . 
  i 'd like to know how the survey was done . 
  thanks , that was interesting . 
  the answer to the question of why 75 % of all the world 's mining operations are based in canada :  `` there 's two sides to it , '' he said . 
  `` one is that there is a concentration of expertise in mining finance and mining law , it does have a historical basis '' he is of course referring to the various canadian gold rushes , the nickel deposits in sudbury , coal in cape breton , etc. 
  `` the other side is that canada provides very favourable conditions . 
  the listing requirements for the tsx [ toronto stock exchange ] are pretty lax , the disclosure requirements are pretty lax , you do n't have to have canadian directories or canadian shareholders to be a canadian company ... and the canadian government does n't ask too many questions about whether you 're paying your taxes in other jurisdictions ( i.e. 
  foreign countries where the mines are operating ) . '', 
  yeah , me too . 
  especially the 16 and 20 point difference to sweden and norway was rather surprising . 
  i wonder what the methodology in the survey was . 
  if it was by self-evaluation , i would n't be at all surprised if the finns would generally downplay their english skills . 
  why not make a sauna set . 
  i mean a real , working sauna set . 
  as much as i like [ the futuro house ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/futuro ) , its shape and curves do n't translate well in lego \u00ae . 
  that was interesting clip ( despite the poorly chosen soundtrack ) !, 
  conversely , i 've been little baffled a few times when in literature a person is described as `` black irish '' . 
  my first impressions were often something like phil lynott , which often clashed with the narrative . 
  then i learned that the term can also refer to a dark-haired ( sometimes with darker complexion ) irish phenotype . 
  yeah , we are few . 
  lot of empty space on our land . 
  denmark and norway have populations of similar numbers ( 5-6m ) . 
  if you 'd ever heard about finland , i bet you would tolerate us slightly . 
  might very well be . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  right , thanks . 
  a misremeberance , for some reason . 
  it 's fairly similar to ireland , actually . 
  helsinki and dublin have both roughly 1-1 ,5 m people ( urban areas , not just municipality ) . 
  we have two cities ( turku and tampere ) that are little bigger than your second city , cork . 
  your country has a million or so ~ ~ more ~ ~ fewer inhabitants but finland [ is much bigger in size ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zajazlk.png ) , which means we have very sparsely populated areas . 
  they do n't even have to be drunk : https://youtu.be/cb2ncqfppsy?t=1m32s ( harry and paul ), 
  well said , and i agree . 
  it 's pretty much same deluded narrative in my country ( although we have the greens bundled in with the left as red-greens ) . 
  this false dichotomy hinders us dealing with the problem . 
  a good and well-rounded article . 
  recommended !, 
  yeah , i know . 
  i just posted it because i realised that my favourite pipe tobacco is kind of bruno st. really do n't like your cheese , though . 
  i heard it [ burns ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dxif82y.jpg ) well . 
  cheese is in huge demand over there . 
  here 's [ some footage . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koyqbsmeihm ), 
  well , the evidence certainly points that way . 
  could n't have been norwegians , their favourite cheese is not actual cheese at all . 
  [ cctv still of the thieves . 
  i thought he was talking about vice `` reporters '' . 
  thanks for the insightful comment . 
  the headline sounded absurd to me . 
  what an intriguing story !, 
  it reminded me of another serial imposter , [ fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric bourdin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_bourdin ) . 
  there 's [ a fantastic article on him \\ ( new yorker , again \\ ) form 2008 ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/11/the-chameleon-2 ) . 
  it 's odd he was n't mentioned in this one . 
  bourdin has now settled down , has kids , and is still a big fan of michael jackson . 
  [ from his youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug2vfrc-xq0 ) . 
  heh heh , that last one is brilliant . 
  i remember this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/3dpuxy/visiting_your_beautiful_country_this_weekend_want/ your sarcasm is strong . 
  hah ha , great !, 
  the first one has brilliant comments . 
  they look visigoths to me . 
  yay !, 
  finland googeled spurdo sp\u00e4rde the most !, 
  just kidding , they googled that fatass kardashian . 
  and so did estonia , but interestingly latvia googled vladimir putin the most . 
  i do n't what to think about that . 
  what should i think ? 
  right , right . 
  i get it now . 
  sort of like the black panthers , except not even close . 
  * finland will implement a cat tax , a license fee for all domestic pet cats . 
  lynxes are exempt . 
  * my visions of locusts return . 
  i see pinkertons coming in swarms .
