  what is a half a meter to such a great thespian ( or maybe some cgi ) . 
  that bomb shelter convention is indeed kind of unusual in europe , and i guess , the world . 
   finland has over 40,000 air-raid shelters which can house 3.8 million people ( 71 % of the population ) . 
  private homes rarely have them , but houses over 600 m2 ( 6,500 sq ft ) are obliged to build them . 
  [ 33 ] fire inspectors check the shelters every ten years and flaws have to be repaired or corrected as soon as possible . 
  the law requires that inhabitants of apartment blocks must clear the shelters and put them into action in less than 72 hours . 
  half of the air-raid shelter has to be ready to use in two hours . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air-raid_shelter#finland many of them are used as rehersal spaces ( what is * treenik\u00e4mpp\u00e4 * in english ) for metal bands . 
  yeah , other bands , too . 
  there 's [ helsinki civil defence museum ] ( http://www.museo-opas.fi/en/museum/helsingin-v%c3%a4est%c3%b6nsuojelumuseo ) for people who interested in bomb shelters . 
  since it 's only concept work and not a real project , why not make it 1500m . 
  nice !,

  good point . 
  those are fine options , too !, 
   it has not yet been announced in which port the vessel will be moored , although large harbours previously mentioned are stockholm , gothenburg , malm\u00f6 , oskarshamn , uddevalla and g\u00e4vle . 
  kungsholmen should offer plenty of mooring space . 
  anywhere more remote would be obviously racist .

  a nuclear power plant in finland was supposed to be ready in 2010 , but now the french company building it says the operation is estimated to be delayed until 2018 -- 2020 . 
  current estimates of the full cost of building the reactor will be about $ 8.5 billion , or almost three times the delivery price of $ 3 billion it has been said the costs will surpass those of the large hadron collider in switzerland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3,

  yeah , agreed . 
  the source is spammy anyway . 
  here 's how they counted the costs : * one night in the cheapest bunk at the least expensive hostel with a good location and good reviews * two public transportation rides per day * one paid/famous attraction per day ( every city is loaded with free things to do for budget-conscious travelers , but here we take the average cost of a major attraction in each city for each day . ), 
  * three `` budget '' meals per day ( we took our minimum meal price and added 20 % to make it more realistic for a longer trip ) . 
  * three cheap , local beers ( or wine ) each day as an `` entertainment fund . '' non-drinkers might have dessert and coffee or attend a local music performance instead , so this is a general benchmark that should be proportional for each city .

  henning wehn taught me this . 
  last summer i met a russian guy in bar in helsinki . 
  a nice enough older fellow with quite good english . 
  we had a few and at one point the conversation turned into the topic of the winter war . 
  not a good subject for a peaceful chat , i know . 
  when i used the word `` invasion '' , he got a bit uneasy and said something about the recent history `` theories '' that said the soviets might have actually attacked without any warning and under false [ casus belli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ) . 
  fair enough , he 'd probably been in school during the soviet times and the history might have been an older version of what happened in reality . 
  when i mentioned the air bombings of our capital , only three hours after the soviet troops crossed the finnish border , he was certain that this never happened . 
  soviets never bombed helsinki during the winter war , he insisted . 
  i told him that the first bombs landed not a half a kilometer away from where we were sitting , and one of the first buildings hit was actually the soviet embassy . 
  at that point i noticed some uneasiness in the surrounding tables . 
  the natives had been listening and were turning restless . 
  igor ( not really , ca n't remember his name now ) sensed this , as well , and quickly remembered that he had to be somewhere else . 
  did n't even finish his drink . 
  maybe he was n't russian , after all .

  sadly somali and iraqi are the least unemployed migrants here in finland . 
  i 'm sure our difficult language does n't help but there are cultural differences that make things worse , too . 
  roughly one in ten of somali females and five in ten males are employed after ten years of their arrival . 
  good points .
