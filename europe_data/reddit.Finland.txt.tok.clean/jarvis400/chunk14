  this is well done , i like it !, 
  want more bears ? 
  here 's [ a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohiv4-dh7lo ) of two zoo-dwelling bear brothers wrestling . 
  i knew it means an animal of aquatic persuasion but had to look up which one : * `` the word `` vesikko '' is the finnish name for the european mink . 
  '' * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_submarine_vesikko, 
  i wonder if the coins smell of onion soup . 
  `` yay ! '', 
  * the dogs, 
  what about schr\u00f6dinger 's cats ? 
  of course . 
  it has a big gun . 
  farts ? 
  thanks . 
   it 's turns out that , at least one of the attackers were a french national , while one is syrian . 
  do you have sources for this ? 
  i 've only read about the one syrian passport found near/on a terrorist ( or a victim ) . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : no matter , found it here : http://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-attacks-syrian-migrant-was-among-the-bombers-1447547354, 
  oh man , i 've never realised this before !, 
  i bet many swedes would love to have st. barts kvar still . 
  what a perfect place [ att vaska ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vaska ) !, 
  yep , us northerners are not lazy but drunks . 
   i dont remember ever hearing about that book or author really . 
  it has been considered as the best finnish novel . 
  well , hs proclaimed this in 1992 and several new printings were made . 
  it 's probably also the most unfinished by the readers , meaning that many people own it but have never read it . 
  i started it several times before i finished it . 
  it 's a fine novel but not an easy read . 
  i personally found the pipe chapter fascinating , but then again i 'm a pipe smoker myself . 
  ha , that was great !, 
  had ` nt seen this . 
  you have most likely seen tim minchin 's [ storm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhguxcudb1u ) but i always like to link to it when comedy meets science in conversation . 
  the unavoidable sketch : [ that mitchell and webb look : homeopathic a&e ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmgibogu8q0 ), 
  [ ricky-tick big band & julkinen sana - ne burnaa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rgeknkicy ) it 's kind of big band hop . 
  i like that wu-tang clannad . 
  oh , [ rubberbandits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnffdirbe6w ) , too !, 
  gulli and palli !, 
  me too . 
  just the word * badass * makes me want to puke . 
   the butter and milk are of very poor quality this is a rude thing to say to the dutch . 
  thanks mr. boyle . 
  ahem ... [ you do n't say ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_crystal_palace ) my point being , what the hell raggare have to do with this ? 
  never would have guessed that novaya zemlya is in europe . 
  ah , it can happen anywhere . 
  * `` police in stockholm were surprised on monday to find that a man they had arrested for buying sex from a prostitute was the duty prosecutor to whom they were obliged to report the crime .

  not a brit but i just saw [ some tips ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qdebcb7.jpg ) on the first page . 
  ah , a pic from a funny website . 
  must be funny then . 
  that sounds like a big improvement . 
  glad to hear that you are doing ok , but how come so [ many other people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medical_debt#/media/file:medical_debt_in_usa._national_health_interview_survey.gif ) in the us have problems paying their medical bills ? 
  well , i understand that those payday loans were a problem for many in europe . 
  but since the eu capped their extortionate rates i think they are not that common anymore . 
  cooler heads will prevail . 
  oh , i wish potential asylum seekers would see those photos . 
  . . in their blood and their tummy ... 
  i love this film , thanks for posting it . 
  i do n't know if there are many people left in finland who could do this anymore . 
  note : click `` cc '' for english subs . 
  edit : in finnish , carpenter is called * kirvesmies * , or an `` ax ( e ) man '' . 
  i wonder why . 
  oh yes . 
  it 's commonly called * viinaralli * ( `` booze rally '' ) . 
  hey , estonia wins in the oecd stats . 
  i wonder if us finns contribute to that number . 
  indeed !, 
  the old stereotype of finns being particularly stabby does n't really hold true . 
  at least not here in finland . 
  once a somali kid showed me his pretty stanley knife in metro , though . 
  good explanation !, 
  i kinda thought it was but decided to be a smart-alain . 
  i wondered why finnish was n't reserved for knives . 
  did you know that there 's a sort of logic ( there are many exceptions , apparently ) in ikea naming conventions : * upholstered furniture , coffee tables , rattan furniture , bookshelves , media storage , doorknobs : swedish placenames * beds , wardrobes , hall furniture : norwegian place names * dining tables and chairs : finnish place names * bookcase ranges : occupations * bathroom articles : scandinavian lakes , rivers and bays * kitchens : grammatical terms , sometimes also other names * chairs , desks : men 's names * fabrics , curtains : women 's names * garden furniture : swedish islands * carpets : danish place names * lighting : terms from music , chemistry , meteorology , measures , weights , seasons , months , days , boats , nautical terms * bedlinen , bed covers , pillows/cushions : flowers , plants , precious stones * children 's items : mammals , birds , adjectives * curtain accessories : mathematical and geometrical terms * kitchen utensils : foreign words , spices , herbs , fish , mushrooms , fruits or berries , functional descriptions * boxes , wall decoration , pictures and frames , clocks : colloquial expressions , also swedish place names source : http://www.businessinsider.com/meaning-of-ikea-product-names-2013-11?ir=t here 's a handy ikea dictionary : http://lar5.com/ikea/ it says * malm\u00f6 * is not a lamp . 
  yeah , a bit unfair to refer to and `` woosh '' for something that ancient . 
  i guess i was influenced by `` the simpsons '' writers reunion i just watched . 
  thanks !, 
  i believe conan o'brian wrote that episode including the song . 
  what about us brain-dead slobs ? 
  is there a chance the track could bend ? 
  `` nagual do\u00f1a juanita matus offers peyote to her young apprentice . '', 
  you are very kind . 
  an honorary irishman !, 
  i did visit ireland for a few weeks , but that was couple of decades ago . 
  i think that exchange drunk thing was a joke article in a finnish humour magazine at one time . 
  not a bad idea , though . 
  i 'm not a native speaker but that translation seems a bit stilted , imo . 
   [ ... ] for performance of human organism . 
  and  maintenance of normal bones hey , maybe it 's in eu and not english , after all . 
  a finn , actually , but i was one of the first ones to take part in the exchange drunk program between our fine countries in the early '90s . 
  my designated pub was in cork but one spring i tottered all the way up to co donegal . 
  indeed !, 
  i liked mcdonagh 's second film * calvary * even more . 
  much darker but yet has great humour about it , as well . 
  trailer here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omlqzau5v0, 
  here 's [ another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blnbk2r3fja ) . 
  ( it 's the opening from the guard fillum ), 
  yay !, 
  a slightly entertaining part of the story was where the accused had produced a statement from his doctor which said that he was having an alcohol problem at the time . 
  this did n't sway the judge . 
  i agree .
