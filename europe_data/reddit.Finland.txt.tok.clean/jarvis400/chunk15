  well , not perhaps daily mail bad but still often very shoddy and populist reporting . 
  the swedish local did report on about how masturbating in public is perfectly legal in sweden . 
  this got picked up by several intl media companies until it , quite obviously , turned out that it was n't true at all . 
  the thing is they are often the only english speaking news sites in many countries in europe . 
  stupid sexy radiation . 
  also : [ project chariot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_chariot ) - a 1958 us atomic energy commission proposal to construct an artificial harbor in alaska by burying and detonating a string of nuclear devices . 
   the turkish part of the audience booed it off . 
  now that is classy . 
  reminds me of this : http://uk.complex.com/sports/2014/11/fan-of-serbian-basketball-team-stabbed-to-death-before-game-against-turkey-turkish-fans-boo-during-moment-of-silence, 
  tank is fine . 
  it was in reference of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ) . 
  i hate people intolerant of other cultures and the dutch . 
  [ pervitin -- good times !, 
  good find !, 
  lol @ the 6/6 !, 
  the 2/6 proves that the swedes are the prettiest of all yurop . 
  sure , i understand that . 
  i guess my comment came out bit disparaging . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  i guess that 's the answer almost always , it varies depending on the state and the area . 
  big country . 
  yeah but they are actually wood -- not chipboard and drywall and thin wood siding like i often see in footage from the us . 
  i mean i do n't actually know us building codes but some houses i 've seen looked more like movie sets than long term dwellings . 
  surely the climate plays a role as well . 
  i 'm pretty sure that american wooden houses would not be up to building code here . 
  perhaps they should be . 
  indeed . 
  also , a brit english teacher living here also says that most finns that speak otherwise fairly good english ca n't discern `` w `` s and `` v '' at all . 
  ah , i bet you are right . 
  yeah , i thought that too but realised that it 's possible that more people have heard finnish spoken . 
  by rally drivers and such , probably . 
  swedish can sound pretty ridiculous . 
  whereas we often sound monotonic and flat , the swedes have that lilting thing going on . 
  they can struggle greatly with `` g `` s and `` j `` s , too . 
  ask a swede to say : `` johnny get me a gin & tonic . 
  ask if they have schweppes ! '', 
  it 's fun . 
  heh , i was going to mention him , as well . 
  the ft article about him is really good , too .

   my grandfather ca n't stand bread with bubbles soda bread ? 
  absolutely . 
  timeless graphic design . 
  yeah !, 
  make them work in saunas . 
  [ a bit like this , then ? 
  sounds very reasonable to me . 
  now we finns must follow suit . 
  yeah it does . 
  [ the cops in the photo are pointing this out . 
  wow , i do n't know how i had missed that news . 
  terrible . 
   the man accused of stabbing to death a woman and two men on an express bus in western norway was an asylum seeker from south sudan who was due to be deported from norway on tuesday , vg has reported . 
  also :  the attack marks the second time the valdres express has been hijacked . 
  in 2003 , it was hijacked by a mentally disturbed 26-year-old ethiopian man who stabbed the driver to death . 
  in the seventeenth century english countryfolk thought that badgers were lopsided . 
  sir thomas browne debunked this ~ ~ myth ~ ~ `` vulgar error '' along with many others in his book * pseudodoxia epidemica * : http://publicdomainreview.org/2015/06/17/a-bestiary-of-sir-thomas-browne/, 
  well put . 
  these people keep whining about the biased mainstream media just because they do n't twist every fucking bit of news being about migrants . 
  very good point . 
  thanks . 
  even [ heroin ] ( http://kuuv.io/i/bavoccf.jpg ) ? 
  indeed . 
  it 's more about anticipating a point of ingress rather than social awkwardness . 
  no point in lining up for just one door . 
  i always carry the donor card on me , but it 's still unsigned . 
  that way someone else can use it after i 'm gone . 
  aaah , i was wondering ` what kind of idiot would do that ? ' . 
  that kind of idiot . 
  anti-job tattoos and all . 
  i understand that it 's the mexicans who should pay big projects like this . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  the few times i 've crossed lately most people just seem to be sleeping or bored , and not drinking that much . 
  then again i keep seeing horror stories of drunken mayhem on the boats , so i guess that still happens . 
  live thread : https://www.reddit.com/live/xh8tv1t954yj, 
  why do you think that ? ... 
  ya cunt . 
  heh , good story !, 
  i can image their horror , a stranger talking to you in an elevator . 
  in a foreign language no less . 
  yeah , it 's slow , but if that also includes the stops and turnarounds etc. 
  that might not be too slow for a city bus . 
  interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  hah , good point . 
  one less human contact to deal with . 
  yeah , that was more of an reference to * okkupert * i recently watched . 
  my addled mind often mixes fact and fiction . 
  very interesting . 
  i also heard that they have plans for thorium-based nuclear energy . 
  i 've seen things you people would n't believe . 
  electric cars on fire off the shoulder of orion . 
  i watched li-ion batteries glitter in the dark near the tannh\u00e4user gate ... 
  are they fireproof ? 
  next : walk like an egyptian . 
  it used to be ` man the harpoons !, 
  ' , now it 's ` harpoon the man ! ' . 
  terrible times .
