  good point . 
  sometimes the data smells of surstr\u00f6mming , too . 
  it 's just a line from [ this old billy bragg / kirsty maccoll \\ ) song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=linnckpeev0 ), 
  i had an uncle who once played for red star belgrade . 
  it 's true . 
  i can tell when the data has gone through sweden because they sometimes \u00e5dd those little circles on my `` a `` s. ** edit ** : see what i mean !, 
  it 's a fairly short ( but interesting ) article . 
  i 'll just copy/paste the whole thing here :  transcripts of chats obtained by german authorities indicate that the two men involved in attacks in the german cities of ansbach and w\u00fcrzburg had repeated contact with suspected members of islamic state via telephone numbers registered in saudi arabia , among other places , spiegel has learned . 
  w\u00fcrzburg perpetrator riaz khan ahmadzai , who is believed to have originated from afghanistan and seriously injured several people on a regional train with an axe and knife on july 18 , also left a goodbye message before engaging in the attack . 
  `` we 'll see each other in paradise , '' he wrote . 
   in chats conducted prior to the attack , an is contact man suggested to the 17-year-old that he drive a car into a mass of people . 
  the perpetrator rejected the suggestion , justifying himself by saying he did n't have a driver 's license . 
  instead , ahmadzai announced , he would board a train and attack the first passengers that are convenient . 
   in the case of the other attack in ansbach , committed by mohammed daleel of syria , the authorities believe the perpetrator 's death on july 24 was likely an accident . 
  they think his intention had been to deposit a backpack carrying homemade explosives within a crowd at a music festival in the city before detonating it remotely . 
   shortly before the attack , his chat contact had called on him to film the detonation and the ensuing inferno and to send the video to is . 
  but it appears the explosive detonated prematurely , killing daleel and injuring 15 others . 
  there is discussion in the chats of daleel perpetrating further attacks . 
  daleel 's face is concealed behind a veil in the video in which he claims responsibility for the attacks , which investigators view as a sign that he may have been planning further ones . 
  investigators also found further bomb-making materials in the apartment where he was staying . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks , i 'll have look . 
  i not too keen on somalis myself but even that page says  these results are controversial and have caused much debate , they must be interpreted with extreme caution . 
  the study is indeed quite controversial . 
  and does intelligence even correlate with tendency to violence ? 
  indeed . 
  [ there 's minorities in my waterpark . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nei76ssdgdk ), 
  i kinda agree with you . 
  hopefully he can handle the publicity . 
  heh , good point . 
  [ `` mr cirk was later hospitalised for physical exhaustion . 
  '' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/iam7zdr.png ) when this zany story is made into a major motion picture , steve buscemi might be a good fit to play mr. cirk 's part . 
  well , it 's the thought that counts . 
  there 's always the sun .

  wow , that was stupid af .

  interesting . 
  finland has been a popular destination for iraqis for some reason . 
  what 's the biggest group of asylum seekers in norway ? 
  edit : nevermind , thanks for the links !, 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , the official line for granting asylums in finland is much stricter now . 
  at the moment 77 % of asylum applications made by iraqis are rejected . 
  i 'm personally ok with the stricter line . 
  i guess the reporter was n't . 
  i believe you are right . 
  ( source : bachelor self , gone almost feral ), 
  very good point . 
  he 's a horsefly enthusiast . 
  good points , did n't notice this myself . 
  heh , indeed !, 
  / u/captain-cliche has done a fine job in colorizing some of those photos : https://www.flickr.com/photos/jenoscolor/albums/72157666316470686 with captions in english ( found via / r/colorizedhistory / ), 
   it makes all these soldiers of odin people who shout `` get that fucking scarf off your head '' to immigrants even more funny . 
  i ca n't resist posting a link to this fun site : edit : ca n't link to tumbler , apparently . 
  i guess that 's a good thing . 
  but if you are interested , google : `` soldiers of odin looking at things '' edit2 : oh dear . 
  the movement of sad cunts is growing !, 
  they apparently have `` chapters '' now in france , poland , czech , iceland ... 
   the left opposition in germany are legally blocking maghreb countries from being listed as `` safe countries of origin '' really !? 
  are n't listed as `` safe countries of origin '' in germany ? 
  from the live thread :  reports by uk tabloids daily mail and the sun that the priest was beheaded are incorrect . 
  lombardi says pope francis condemns killing in france `` in the most drastic way '' and is praying for the victims . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for the updates !, 
  much more useful than the countless snide/sarcastic comments here . 
  indeed . 
  ` silly season ' with quaint animal news and such . 
  well , mental illness sans medication can be an excuse but also a * reason * . 
  i think the excuse part only comes into play when the trial begins, 
  many thanks for the update !, 
  sadly , most people here have already decided that this was an islamist terrorist attack . 
  most will never see your comment , nor learn what truly happened . 
  maybe kill the poor ? 
  the correct answer . 
  ... and kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen , and th\u00e4t hydraulic press guy . 
  great examples of combining old and new architecture and good planning . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  that 's a good point . 
  at the time the eiffel tower was seen as huge monstrosity by the majority .

  neocalssical is perfectly correct .

  this is the fate for polar bears in iceland . 
  http://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2011/06/10/icelands-polar-bear-policy/ edit : form the article :  * some argue that they should be tranquillised and shipped off to greenland . 
  is that an option ? 
  have iceland and greenland communicated on this ? 
  *  the ministry for the environment has contacted authorities in greenland regarding this option and commissioned an expert group to study that option , as well as others . 
  greenlandic authorities allow the hunting of about 50 polar bears in east greenland each year , which they deem to be a safe limit for the stock . 
  they have told us that they fail to see the rationale behind shipping stray polar bears alive from iceland to greenland , given that this is a rare occurrence and has no effect on the species and its survival . 
  thanks , this is interesting . 
  i should have made clear that i was talking about aj english ( the producer of the doco in question ) , and not the arabic channel . 
  i do n't know arabic but i have learned they have radically different content and angle . 
  i still maintain that calling aje `` an islamist news agency '' is not truthful . 
  here 's a rather famous photo from the congress http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article30335314.ece/alternates/h342/spanishcoup.jpg, 
  thanks for the examples , i 'll take a look . 
  i understand that their their arabic content has a quite different bias from their english reporting .
