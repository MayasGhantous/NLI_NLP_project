  have n't really followed the former at all . 
  very true . 
  i see i should have made the distinction between the english and arabic . 
  ok then . 
  edit : is it because they show those beheading videos , or because their name is awfully `` araby '' ? 
  ok then . 
   as we all know , all jazeera is an islamist news agency , hence the documentary is totally biased . 
  this is n't true at all . 
  although like every news source [ they have been accused of bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_jazeera_controversies_and_criticism ) , and like all news sources they ca n't be * absolutely * unbiased , they are most certainly not an '' [ islamist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamism ) '' news agency . 
  same as the christian science monitor is n't a religious publication in its reporting . 
  thanks for the link , i 'll watch this later . 
  hey , it 's all right . 
  cheers . 
  that was interesting . 
  they really are great stories !, 
  i still remember reading the [ br\u00f6derna lejonhj\u00e4rta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_brothers_lionheart ) at about 7-8 years of age . 
  i think now that i was way too young for that book . 
  a good article , thanks . 
  i found this intriguing :  after the war , sweden tried to form a nordic defense alliance . 
  this was rejected by denmark and norway who in 1949 instead chose to join nato . 
  sweden resorted to an official policy of non-alignment in peacetime and aimed at neutrality during times of war . 
  as strange as this might look today , there was a good reason for this . 
  had sweden joined nato at the time , this would probably have caused the soviet union to tighten its grip on the already subdued finland , possibly even annexing it . 
  this would have benefited neither sweden , who would then once again have its own land border with the soviet union , nor nato , which would be faced with an even longer border with the soviet union . 
  ah , you know [ emil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_i_l%c3%b6nneberga ) , too !, 
  books or [ films ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14k0dyjkwuu ) ? 
  sorry to hear this . 
  maybe try / r/milano and / r/italy , as well . 
  interesting !, 
  i 'd never heard about this cereal before . 
   triticale , which is a hybrid of wheat ( triticum ) and rye ( secale ) , is mainly used for animal feed . 
  moar :  depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . 
  it is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  their operation tactics/rules seem to vary a lot from country to country . 
   an entire generation is being drilled to accept that operating above society as a belligerent economic agent is not just normal , but virtuous . 
  well put , and i agree !, 
  i 'm in !, 
  ( can i bring my knife ? ), 
  ( edit : this is because i like to whittle wooden figurines in a shed ), 
  yeah , its surprising . 
  more about chief mousers : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chief_mouser_to_the_cabinet_office  the cat with the longest known tenure at downing street is wilberforce , who served for eighteen years under edward heath , harold wilson , jim callaghan , and margaret thatcher . 
  it looks like they had that phone call system according to this from [ the live thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/live/x8sgngqk712c ) :  some tech updates about the railway and the trains involved : according to wikipedia ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferrovia_bari-barletta ) this railway has not automatic safety infrastructure , it 's old and it 's managed by humans with the so called `` blocco telefonico '' method : each station guard ( in this case the one in andria e the one in corato ) has to phone the next station before sending a train and ask if there 's another train already on the line . 
  there 's no automatic block or something on the line . 
  good points . 
  my background is obviously quite different coming from a country with a 1-2 % muslim population . 
  and my comment was really a generalisation on xenophobia and how i believe that living and meeting with different kinds of people tends to alleviate fear and/or hatred . 
  just a personal observation . 
  i certainly do n't want to underplay the dangers of religious fanatisism . 
  yeah , that came out a little sarcastic/giddy , i guess . 
  it 's a good thing they were caught . 
  this is certainly more serious than just forging more expensive evo from regular olive oil . 
  previous discussion on the subject : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qy1me/paris_bans_cars_built_before_1997_in_battle/, 
  people often fear things they do n't know . 
  he is , and he will be upvoted for it . 
  yay , it 's my favourite news source : olive oil times !, 
   the agents set up a device to detect the movement of trucks and found that a company based in ja\u00e9n was the recipient of consignments of sunflower oil from france , palm oil from ecuador and avocado oil from greece . 
  they also found that the company was acquiring flavorings and colorants not needed for its designated commercial activities . 
  bastards !, 
  thanks !, 
  indeed . 
  and she has said : [ ` brexit means brexit ' and there will be no attempt to remain inside eu . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-brexit-means-brexit-conservative-leadership-no-attempt-remain-inside-eu-leave-europe-a7130596.html ), 
  good point . 
  maybe they will hold his mail for the next pm . 
  from a tiny acorn grows the mighty elk . 
  fleet is fine . 
  i guess you are right . 
  that , too . 
  but i was thinking female wrestling ... 
  i personally thought the core issue was xenophobia , largely disseminated by the press . 
  well , perhaps that was the mechanism , and not the reason . 
  i 'd like to watch oiled danes and swedes wrestle . 
  and brown sauce .

  good writing . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  thanks , johnny bob !, 
  enough tall buildings !, 
  i think it would be good . 
  or maybe a telephone hotline . 
  `` hello , um ... salaam aleikum ... are you by any chance planning any attacks on heathrow tomorrow afternoon . '', 
  `` wa aleikum salaam , thanks for calling ask isis . 
  let me check ... heathrow , heathrow ... no , nothing planned for tomorrow . 
  you may want to stay away from gatwick , though . '', 
  `` will do , many thanks ! '', 
  / r/askeurope or / r/askisis, 
  ha , that was really well done !, 
  and probably factual , as well . 
  well said , i agree, 
  i 'm actually a bit worried about the next episode of mock the week . 
  yay , finland is still half communist . 
  it 's true . 
  it 's been said that the [ heavy reparations we had to pay to ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war_reparations_to_the_soviet_union ) , mostly in forms of ships and machinery , actually helped to build up our heavy industry after the war . 
  is n't it . 
  and i was only half joking . 
  nothing like media attention from abroad to cause stir here . 
  the pins are actually compressed from large trees .
