  heh , i can easily believe that . 
  double consonants and vowels probably help . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  ** edit : ** hey , would n't be great if a french m\u00f6lkky club would hear about this , and held a demonstration in the front of the finnish embassy in order to rise awareness for the plight of the finnish unemployed used as unpaid labour . 
  maybe the idiots here in power would take a harder look on the fucking scherade that the mol is . 
  good to hear !, 
  i do n't know how popular it is but there seems to be japanese association , as well . 
  ha , well done !, 
  ze germans have a [ long history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steinhuder_hecht ) of building [ fishy subs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nav1ygf.jpg?1 ) . 
  `` molk\u00ed '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aakchvgutyg, 
  indeed . 
  m\u00f6lkky is better for playing on uneven surfaces . 
  this might explain some of its popularity . 
  i had no idea until i saw this article . 
  i suppose the similarity to all the boules games has helped . 
  edit : i should add that p\u00e9tanque is somewhat popular here in finland . 
  i have a set and play it every summer . 
  not often enough to improve , though . 
  finland beats you easily in car shittiness ( 2010 stat . 
  ) : http://www.aut.fi/en/statistics/international_statistics/average_age_of_passenger_cars_in_some_european_countries_2010, 
  it 's weird how things go . 
  damn . 
  i had no idea that they exported the sweatshop industry like that . 
  really unfair for the local economy . 
  actually , now i remember seeing inspector montalbano solving a murder in his native sicily that took place in a illegal garment factory . 
  / r/finlandconspiracy, 
  i had no idea that italy had so many chinese migrants . 
  also , this sounds pretty bad :  regional president enrico rossi vowed to tackle crime in the area , where he said half of all economic activity is illegal , 1 billion euros in taxes go unpaid every year , and money is laundered through international transfers . 
  yay !, 
  well , i hope that this wo n't happen . 
  it would be terrible for the spanish economy , real estate especially . 
  it certainly does n't look good . 
  thanks . 
  that was truly intriguing , and terrifying . 
  just one of the points he made : the two million uk retirees now residing in spain and elsewhere in eu will have to come to uk for their free/cheap healthcare . 
  and at the same time when east european workers , who are net payers into the nhs , might move back to their countries . 
  good job , thanks . 
  ( although i recommend watching the video , as well . ), 
  if we do n't hear from him it 's because he 's been murderded by them , as well . 
  it 's a good one !, 
  here 's the trailer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cno0bicrm8k edit : oh man , i 've never seen a trailer that gives so much of the movie away . 
  oh , i agree . 
  i 'm sure it 's not staged . 
  like i said , that came out a bit bitter . 
  the cgi innuendo was a reference to the film ` wag the dog ' and was meant as a snide humour . 
  ah , this makes more sense . 
  great marketing , though . 
  showing the moldovans as brave underdogs of the bad russia , grateful enough to learn a foreign language in order to thank the future customers for the chance to sell them their wine . 
  all is missing a peasant girl carrying a cgi cat through destroyed moldovian village . 
  well , that came out more callous than i meant . 
  i have n't tried moldovan wines but wish their makers all the best . 
  ( i moved my comment before i saw this ) i believe this clip has parts of the same footage : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxvxr4ubeta, 
  i think the footage is from 2014 , so it 's hardly `` breaking '' . 
  the narrative text added on the video is mostly made up , presenting the rioters as `` refugees '' etc. 
  see all the palestine flags ? 
  as far as i remember this was french pro-palestine citizens protesting israel 's bombing of gaza . 
  that was in reference to [ wojtek the bear ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wojtek_\\ ( bear \\ ) ) . 
  i admit he was in artillery rather than the air force . 
  piloted by bears . 
  heh , the best explanation . 
  that 's exactly the narrative here . 
  shippost . 
  their readers are not big readers ? 
  was n't meant as rebuttal . 
  just an observation . 
  oh , i agree . 
  and it 's quite possible that the russians started it . 
  would n't be the first time they attack without a warning . 
  an unnamed brit quality tabloid has great photos of these sad idiots . 
  along with a completely neutral headline : *** dozens of england fans are injured in running battles against hundreds of knife-wielding russian thugs - and riot police *** . 
  ah , i saw rees-mogg in some panel show andi thought he was doing a tory parody routine , but it turns out he is for real . 
  still , very entertaining . 
  perfect \u00e4mp\u00e4ri-video . 
  i loved their finnish fashion report . 
  i do n't know about lithuania , but in finland lidl has been well received by the consumers because they have caused some real price competition in the daily goods market . 
  before that there was a virtual duopoly of two big chain operators . 
  i think lidl has only about 7-8 % market share now but they have already forced the others checking their pricing . 
  i 'm happy to report that the availability ( and the quality ) of weed in finland has gone up in the recent years . 
  oddly enough , if asked , i would n't know where to buy it . 
  people seem to share it rather freely . 
  apparently coke is fairly rare in finland and speed is much more common . 
  you can recognize a tweaker here by his attire of a flame beanie and wrap-around mirrored shades driving away on your bike . 
  well , that 's the stereotype anyway . 
  unpleasant people . 
   basically this thread is full of myths and conjecture , contrary to facts . 
  heh , i agree . 
  i think you have a good point there . 
  that 's indeed odd . 
   fentanyl is approximately 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine and roughly 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade ( 100 % pure ) heroin . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fentanyl no wonder it causes deaths . 
  that looks better . 
  rootsi 's ( sweden ) numbers are on the rise , though . 
  i wonder what causes that . 
  [ love is a battlefield !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igvzolv9spo ), 
  sorry about that . 
  that 's fantastic !, 
  thanks !, 
  heh , look at us finns quaff wine . 
  i mean , we just barely beat the united arab emirates .
