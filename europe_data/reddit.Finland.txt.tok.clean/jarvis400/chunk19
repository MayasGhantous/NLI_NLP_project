  this is europe , ffs . 
  we wank in the office . 
  is there a chance the track could bend ? 
  reddit live : https://www.reddit.com/live/ypc6gla8vb3f, 
  if anyone is interested , here 's a good ( and very long ) article about how the events unfolded in the autumn of 2015 : http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-08/refugees-open-border-policy-september-2015-angela-merkel/komplettansicht, 
  well , the [ original euractiv article that the register links to ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/eu-to-propose-new-rules-on-police-access-to-encrypted-data-in-june/ ) is much less alarmist than the * `` europe will go all in for crypto backdoors in june '' * among other things it says :  the european commission will propose new measures in june to make it easier for police to access data on internet messaging apps like whatsapp and  a legal change would be most effective on the eu level , he added , insisting that he does not want to create so-called encryption backdoors or built-in access for police that weakens security technology . 
  and  gilles de kerchove , the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator , said `` it 's much too early to say that backdoor would be a solution '' for accessing encrypted data of messaging services like whatsapp and telegram . 
  imo , that 's pretty far cry from from the alarmist bullshit that the register once again spouts . 
  all the other links and sources are to the register 's own pieces . 
  i hate that smug fucker . 
  as if the locals do n't know when the fruit are ready for picking . 
  was n't eddie hogwards that brit ski jumper ? 
  for those interested here 's a more in-depth article from 2015 : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-23/how-berlin-s-futuristic-airport-became-a-6-billion-embarrassment, 
  the guy is just making shit up . 
  there 's nothing like that in the finnish article either . 
  he just made it up . 
  there 's nothing like that in the article . 
   ruling finns as binge drinking baboons sounds just ... hilarious . 
  pot calling the kettle black . 
  neither the finnish article or the swedish comment for the proposed law update said anything of the sort . 
  you are just making shit up . 
  i approve of their new name . 
  * tom of winter germany, 
  it appears that the last successful case in denmark was in 1946 . 
   this marks the fourth time in history anyone has been prosecuted under denmark 's blasphemy clause : four people were sentenced for posting posters mocking jewish teachings in 1938 ; two people were fined for carrying out a fake baptism at a masked ball in 1946 ; and two programme leaders at danish radio were exonerated in 1971 for airing a song mocking christianity . 
  i do n't think this is bowing to islam , just applying an old law not relevant in today 's society anymore . 
  also , he seems to bow to anything that he feels makes him look good . 
  or richer . 
   comment about trump being prescient about this , as well , plus some sweeping generalisations on nordic socialism and link to an obscure blog article about racial realism . 
  what does trump has to do with this ? 
  i was wondering if they decided to prosecute this case only in order to test if the law is even valid in today 's danish society . 
  yeah , some european countries still have ancient blasphemy laws in place . 
  previous cases in denmark :  this marks the fourth time in history anyone has been prosecuted under denmark 's blasphemy clause : four people were sentenced for posting posters mocking jewish teachings in 1938 ; two people were fined for carrying out a fake baptism at a masked ball in 1946 ; and two programme leaders at danish radio were exonerated in 1971 for airing a song mocking christianity . 
  in finland a similar law was removed in 1999 . 
  there 's a more recent law against `` harassing religious worship '' , that deals with more physical acts , such as disturbing a religious service and such . 
  thanks for taking the time to explain this . 
  but if his comment was sexual innuendo , would it still be wrong ? 
  i learned a lot of my english from robert crumb and [ he says ` lay ' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/x1v8c1c.jpg ) [ nsfw ] . 
  topppings that lay together , stay together . 
  i noticed this , as well . 
  the mods apparently removed the post , and i agree with them . 
  the two cops interviewed in the video have said that their quotes were taken out of context completely . 
  he turned a silly media uproar into a lesson in civics  `` i do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza , '' gu\u00f0ni , a former history professor at the university of iceland , wrote . 
  `` i am glad i do not hold such power . '' and  presidents should `` not have unlimited power '' , he continued . 
  `` i would not want to hold this position if i could pass laws forbidding that which i do n't like . 
  i would not want to live in such a country . 
  for pizzas , i recommend seafood . '' no wonder he has approval rating of 97 % . 
  and * berggren * is clearly just swedish for rashid ad-din sinan , also known as the old man of the * mountain * , the founder of syrian sect of assassins . 
  `` municipal elections '' in english . 
  and under his name `` reverend , champion/defender of nature '' . 
  i absolutely agree with all you said . 
  but the thing is most people want to see violence answered with violence . 
  they also see good tactics as `` running away '' . 
  your highness !, 
  he 's the president of finland . 
  what a great name , rosebud barcalounger . 
  someone told me she is n't even a real marine . 
  last year the bears of helsinki zoo woke up early in february , as well . 
  here 's [ a video of their first outing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edtp4-cx76e ) . 
  [ moar bear playing footage from 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohiv4-dh7lo ) . 
  again , their first time out that year . 
  edit : now , after re-watching the second video , i 'm starting to think that those are not bears but people in bearsuits . 
  especially [ the end is suspicious . 
  heh , yeah , i was thinking the same thing . 
  although the headline might give that impression , it 's not exactly an outright ban :  summarising the discussion , a wikipedia editor wrote : `` consensus has determined that the daily mail ( including its online version [ url removed ] ) is generally unreliable , and its use as a reference is to be generally prohibited , especially when other more reliable sources exist . 
  as a result , the daily mail should not be used for determining notability , nor should it be used as a source in articles . 
  an edit filter should be put in place , going forward to warn editors attempting to use the daily mail as a reference . '' and :  the move is likely to stop short of prohibiting linking to the daily mail , as there will be instances , such as when a wikipedia entry is about the newspaper or one of its writers , when the editors believe a link is necessary . 
  instead a system for flagging any uses of the newspaper as a source will be introduced , asking editors not to use it and find alternatives . 
  thanks !, 
  you have to admire op 's calm against all that mirth and ridicule . 
  also , what i missed then was that there was an actual hybrid recipe he followed : http://allrecipes.com/recipe/roaster-yorkshire-chicken/detail.aspx, 
  i remember that photo !, 
  what was the dish again , can you link pls ? 
  wow , never heard about this before . 
  indeed he did . 
  the good kind . 
  great photo !, 
  the thumbnail made me think of simon st\u00e5lenhag 's paintings . 
  very well put . 
  yeah , it 's an old finnish joke . 
  edit : if anyone is wondering , the above statement is not true at all . 
  samoa was one of the rare nations that changed their traffic from right to left in 2009 . 
  this was done in order to use cheaper second hand autos from aus an nz . 
  the article fails to mention that , the swedes being swedes , they decided that the heavy vehicles should switch sides one week earlier than the rest of the motor vehicles . 
  what a clusterfuck it was . 
  or , so i have been told . 
  carpe denim . 
  yay !, 
  enough !, 
  well , they do live on the other side of the ice . 
  the man in the photo is just going home . 
  yeah , i 'm sure you are right . 
  i was just reading the town 's wiki and it 's certainly has had an illustrious past . 
  now that is beautiful . 
  it seems that this original tivoli has lent its name to [ many other places and venues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tivoli ) . 
  weirdy enough ` tivoli ' in finnish means a sort of travelling , often shabby , amusement park/carnival type of things that are all but extinct now . 
  i suspect that name is taken from the copenhagen tivoli amusement park . 
  similar thing happened to friend of mine . 
  crashed into a kangaroo , which died on the spot . 
  he decided take a photo and thought it would be funnier if he put his sunglasses on the kangaroo first .
