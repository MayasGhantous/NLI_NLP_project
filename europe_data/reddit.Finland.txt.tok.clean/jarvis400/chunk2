  that 's really clever . 
  are these common in sweden ? 
  thanks , had n't seen that one . 
  explains gandhi 's butthurtness . 
  real gandhi would now be spinning in his grave ... because he liked to spin when he was alive . 
  then , of course , he was cremated . 
  so no grave spinning . 
  that sounded familiar ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjloxbrntz4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m55s, 
  ha , very true !, 
  i personally did n't like it at all . 
  i only saw it halfway because the light show caused a grand mal seizure . 
  woke up on a floor couple of hours later . 
  still flashing . 
  ( hear , hear ) . 
  maybe your `` song '' should have had more tits ? 
  and dildo foam churning . 
  next time lets see some live copulation . 
  that was a fucking disgrace . 
   personally , i think this is the funniest thing i 've ever witnessed , and being an austrian makes it even funnier to me , because i know the debate that has gone for weeks here . 
  i think i know how you feel , as a finn after lordi 's win . 
  the difference here is that conchita was a solo artist , had much less make-up and could actually fucking sing . 
  she was fabulous . 
  * the little book of calm * is better . 
   there was a study made that people in finland with a licence to carry are significantly less likely to be involved in a violent crime or any criminal act than people without one . 
  just to clarify , actual * carry * permits ( outside the law enforcement ) are incredibly rare in finland , the gun permits here are acquisition licenses ( a separate license for each individual firearm ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_finland also , i 'd be interested to see a source for that study . 
  great stuff !, 
  looks like a good comedy series . 
  ( do n't forget to click the english captions on ), 
  oh you americans and your at least 557 varieties of guns . 
  oh man , this is indeed terrible . 
  sorry to hear this . 
  finland just replaced the television licence with a direct unconditional income tax , * yle-vero * , which is 50-140 $ depending on income . 
  the proceeds are used for funding the public broadcaster * yleisradio * . 
   it 's photoshopped to show her face more clearly ( and add ugly make up ) and make the colors pop a bit more . 
  it 's photoshopped to make her face clearly more ugly . 
  i think they were going for a cartoon witch look . 
  i 'm well aware of that . 
  i was talking about the hitler ballot : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_election_and_referendum,_1938 my point was to make a humorous comparison of the similar layout ( or gui ) where one choice is clearly a better choice . 
  i 'm not trying to imply : `` britain literally ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ third reich '' , but i just find that ballot really ridiculous . 
  saying `` yes '' is made easier in both cases . 
  `` poor lawrence '' ... 
  the man is clearly a firebug . 
  ah , i 've always thought we were called * reindeer * ( `` poro '' in finnish ) . 
  ( reindeer is apparently * p\u00f5hjap\u00f5der * in estonian . ), 
  i guess it 's the russians that call us `` poro '' ( reindeer ) . 
  yeah , sorry about the perpetually drunken herds of moose hoofing on the time-honored , cobblestone streets of your august capital . 
  i 've actually visited tallinn sober a few times . 
  well , almost sober . 
  ok , i was able to walk back to the boat without help . 
  now when i think about it , moose do n't form herds like reindeer do ... 
  i 'd like to hear some estonian jokes about finland . 
  ** edit ** : thanks for all the jokes . 
  very depressive . 
  good stuff , that gammel dansk . 
  yea , and they also enable you to enjoy the shit stench during and after the defecation . 
  oh , their fucking * sitzpinkel * movement . 
  that probably started because many of their toilets have those dry shelves to hold your shei\u00dfe after the dump . 
  so you can evaluate and enjoy it afterwards , i guess . 
  no wonder this perverted design causes some splashing when urinating standing up . 
  yes , that was a awkward moment for qi . 
  they used an urban myth as a fact . 
  i personally can see the basic income a very good idea , depending on how it would be implemented . 
  here in finland the basic income has received some positive reactions from the left and the right alike . 
  here 's some thoughts : the people living on ( social - , unemployment ) benefits would have * more * incentive to take short , or part-time jobs without the fear of losing the basic income . 
  the current system does n't encourage this at all . 
  you can earn up to 300 $ without losing your benefits , and this requires a lot of paperwork . 
  entrepreneurship would be boosted . 
  the current system basically can disqualify you from any benefits for a year or two if your small business fails . 
  this can raise the risk of starting your own business . 
  the system is also seen as a good way to reduce the absurd ( and costly ) bureaucracy people face when applying for benefits - especially the old people and people with mental health problems are often affected . 
  i understand most of the social workers here are now just handling need-based benefit applications . 
  arguably , some version of an unified basic income could be actually cheaper for the society . 
  this data was collated by ef language school :  the ef english proficiency index calculates a country 's average adult english skill level using data from two different ef english tests completed by hundreds of thousands of adults every year . 
  one test is open to any internet user for free . 
  the second is an online placement test used by ef during the enrollment process before students start an english course . 
  both include grammar , vocabulary , reading , and listening sections . 
   the open online test is a 30-question adaptive exam , so each test-taker 's questions are adjusted in difficulty according to his or her previous correct and incorrect answers . 
  the non-adaptive test is 70 questions in length . 
  all scores have been validated against ef 's course levels . 
  the test administration is identical for both tests , with test takers completing the exam on computers .

  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/daprv0hiyse?t=2m54s ), 
  that 's right . 
  do you have any data on that ? 
  any other than personal anecdotes or impressions . 
  smokers ( and fat people ) are actually cheaper to the society than `` healthy '' people : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/05iht-obese.1.9748884.html study : http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 as you see , this does n't even include the huge tobacco tax income the governments receive . 
  this may sound odd , but apparently smokers ( and fat people ) are actually cheaper to the society than `` healthy '' people : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/05iht-obese.1.9748884.html study : http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 as you see , this does n't even include the huge tobacco tax income the governments receive . 
  [ church , you say ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci8iokkhrjy ), 
  thanks , that was interesting !, 
  the dutch sound like pragmatic people . 
  none of that pesky shouting and flailing about . 
  then again , the ediplomat has apparently for more business oriented advice than the one op linked . 
  i obviously checked out [ what do they say about us finns ] ( http://www.ediplomat.com/np/cultural_etiquette/ce_fi.htm ) ( curiosity about what people say about us * is * another national trait ) . 
  i found a few things a bit funny ( italics are mine ) : * keep some physical distance from finns . 
  [ ... ] ( * they always carry a knife . . * ) * never hug , kiss or touch a finn . 
  [ ... ] ( * they are often contagious ... and carry a knife * ) edit : [ the danes ] ( http://www.ediplomat.com/np/cultural_etiquette/ce_dk.htm ) do n't like to be touched either . 
  or to go * see a man about a dog * .
