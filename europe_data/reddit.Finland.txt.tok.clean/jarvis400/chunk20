  when he stepped back for the photo the kangaroo suddenly roused , stood up and hopped away .

  it 's already on top of the reddit , hence the downvotes . 
  that 's tom robinson . 
  that trope is honestly kinda passed here , i think . 
  well , maybe some rednecks will still try to keep that tired joke alive . 
  that was my reaction to this as well . 
  i believe this the study in question : https://www.otto-brenner-stiftung.de/otto-brenner-stiftung/aktuelles/die-fluchtlingskrise-in-den-medien.html, 
  i thought op captured the style of j [ apanese prefectural flags ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_japanese_flags#prefectural_flags ) quite well . 
  i agree !, 
  could n't see the country names on mobile , but knew immediately it was finland . 
  i see , thanks for the info . 
  my mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun . 
  yeah , that too . 
  edit : actually , i think that 's roughly where sweden 's biggest lake , * v\u00e4nern * is . 
  maybe it 's less cloudy over the lake area ... 
  i believe that is a term for masturbation . 
  very good quip , i thought . 
  i wonder what 's the reason for that blue blob in southern sweden ? 
  hopefully it works out well !, 
  good point . 
  yeah , i just knew the link this guy keeps spamming was going to be the one from this gefira blog . 
  sites like zerohedge and speisa happily link to it whenever they can . 
  however , [ this nyt article ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/14/world/europe/migrant-rescue-efforts-deadly.html ) ( which is actually well sourced ) shows the tendency of rescues happening closer to africa . 
  hey , it might very well be true . 
  i knew it had to be ben garrison . 
  ok then . 
  their finance pages have some intriguing propositions . 
  i 'm going to be be a millionaire soon . 
  is the * nigerian * guardian a reliable news source ? 
  true !, 
  it does n't work too well with rubber boots though . 
  i always wear a sweater made of steel wool in thunderstorms . 
  it 's invigorating . 
  yeah , i 'm kowtowing to papists this week . 
  that 's interesting !, 
  i had no knowledge of your st.john 's customs . 
  i suppose not , even though i have n't been in estonia on midsummer . 
  you build bonfires , as well ? 
  i read somewhere that they also do bonfires in spain . 
  the swedes have their maypoles etc.

  you 're welcome . 
  well , for one thing * `` when allowed to work , they tend to start businesses and integrate themselves into the workforce as fast as possible , paying more into the social systems than they extract from them '' * is incredibly optimistic , and is n't happening at least in my country . 
  my only problem was n't just the false facts but also the style ; simplifying something that just ca n't be simplified . 
  in my opinion they are just giving xenophobes free ammo . 
  edit : many errors in their claims and sources have been pointed out ( and downvoted by the fans ) here https://www.reddit.com/r/kurzgesagt/comments/3lcace/i_am_very_disappointed_by_kurzgesagts_new_video/ i guess it was the kurzgesagagt 's incredibly arrogant answer in the thread that was the final straw for me . 
  [ the european refugee crisis and syria explained ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvonxh3nn9w ) i agree with his highness , it was a terrible video . 
  i agree !, 
  i 'm a leftie who believes in controlled immigration of refugees from the camps into the eu , but that video was utter utter bullshit . 
  it was a weird propaganda effort riddled with factual errors and biased rhetoric . 
  after people pointed out these errors they refused to admit any of them . 
  how i can i possibly believe any of their videos after that .

  hey , that 's pretty good !, 
  thanks , really interesting !, 
   the blue discharges and jets are examples of a little-understood part of our atmosphere . 
  electrical storms reach into the stratosphere and have implications for how our atmosphere protects us from radiation . 
  i did n't know about this either . 
  looks like a worthwhile project to me . 
  it appears that swissinfo is indeed a partner in the project . 
   the project is a partnership between the university of sheffield as part of gate , the university of warwick , king 's college london , saarland university in germany and modul university vienna . 
  four companies are also taking part - atos , ihub nairobi , ontotext and swissinfo . 
  pheme is funded by the eu .

  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ `` hear , ^ ^ ^ hear '' . 
  odd ( now there 's a good old swedish name ) that virtually all the top names are so `` international '' . 
  were liam 's parents oasis fans , or is there another reason ? 
  here in finland we 've had a minor surge in foreign names but also many older finnish names are popular again , as well .

  oh , they do know their ~ ~ minks ~ ~ [ submarines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_submarine_incidents ) well . 
  i hear that you must have written agreement from all the parties before engaging sex . 
  or , as they did in the 60s and 70s , just film the entire event . 
  based on their own precious swedish opinion , of course . 
  oh look , i 've found [ some footage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/adp2s.gif ) of their naval hegemony .

   the european spelling of colour is colour . 
  yes , i noticed it right after posted it . 
  i 'm terribly sorry . 
  thanks for the educational style guide !, 
  one of the things i learned was that * european * should be spelled with a capital e. 
   think op 's submission is just good natured fun ( and it 's actually pretty remarkable there are that many shades of colors for boring blazers :p ) absolutely . 
  i was merely amused to find this collection .

  i 'd like to remind you that the swedes were doing it wrong . 
  the whole idea of the heavy vehicles switching to right-hand traffic two weeks earlier than the rest , was , in my opinion , idiotic . 
  actually , you may be right , after all . 
  there used to be a statistic that * did * show much higher numbers . 
  in fact , when i look again at the wiki i linked i see that finlands numbers come now from the ministry of interior ~ ~ decoration ~ ~ that might estimate the number of illegal guns low . 
  if we look at the numbers form the swiss study where the most other countries ' numbers come , it shows finland 's figure as high as 56/100 . 
  bang bang . 
  edit : not really ; 32 guns per 100 residents . 
  very similar number to other nordic countries , france , canada etc.
