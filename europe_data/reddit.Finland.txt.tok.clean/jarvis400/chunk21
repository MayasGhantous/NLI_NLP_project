  also , huge majority of these are long guns for hunting . 
  only 5.5 / 100 are handguns .

  `` l'estonie , douze points ! '', 
  but of course . 
  hear , hear !, 
  here 's a nice version : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwnliqhyh0, 
  i agree with you on ode of joy , but think [ this is ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jk-ncrmvcw ) one of the europe 's better known anthems . 
   nice try finland . 
  well , i could n't very well vote for our own anthem . 
  also , is n't this vote-for-your-neighbour 's - tune system quite popular in european song contests ? 
  you had to say it , did n't you ... 
  yes the original 1846 lyrics by johan ludvig runeberg were in swedish . 
  i love the estonian national anthem , especially the melody . 
  oh , you lithuanians and your sense of humour . 
  shit , it was frankie boyle , thanks for the correction . 
  `` all those bullet proof screens around barack obama show just how racist america is .

  `` they say of the acropolis , where the parthenon is ... '' : [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huvbxb4xiqe] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huvbxb4xiqe ), 
  ah , you got it , almost . 
  the boy scouts of america . 
  ouch !, 
  hey , i just remembered a question i heard recently : what group of people burns the most american flags ? 
  i know !, 
  same in english : [ http://yle.fi/uutiset/campaigners_to_present_anti-nuclear_petition_to_parliament/6175422] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/campaigners_to_present_anti-nuclear_petition_to_parliament/6175422 ) as you can see , this is about 10,000 finns signing an internet petition . 
  while a good thing , imo , still not major news . 
  this , however , is much more important news : [ `` new rules for foreign berry-pickers in lapland '' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/new_rules_for_foreign_berry-pickers_in_lapland/6175213 ) edit : also ( breaking !, 
  this is a very good point . 
  i talked to my norteamericano friend ( living for 15 years in finland now ) about this the other day and he agreed that the us flag 's ubiquitousness dilutes the symbol , making it in a way a weaker symbol . 
  btw , same goes with language , in my opinion . 
  with the constant overuse of superlatives and hyperbole , what 's left ? 
  when people are persistently floored , stunned and amazed of most mundane things , how can one describe something truly sensational ? 
  thanks !, 
  i shall reconsider the target of my of hatred ... `` i like greeks in general , and their salad , too . '', 
  i agree , the truth . 
  also , now * i * am on the bottom . 
  i hate ~ ~ illinois ~ ~ greek nazis . 
  op , care to explain the point or context of this ( clearly photoshopped ) pic ? 
  i 'm guessing it 's an allegory of some kind i just fail to understand ? 
  i 'm not happy . 
  too fucking bad . 
  it sounds a good idea to me .

  yea , but they are so fucking obvious , given !, 
  no , seriously , well done !, 
  but , ladies and gentlemen , since i got your attention ; i 'd like to present you a one of the better finnish rock 'n roll bands :[ flaming sideburns ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tdmw-jvypu ), 
  yea , i get it , but i still decided to try it for the eureddit . 
  i 'm old . 
  that 's why the old music . 
  good additions , all !, 
  * tenhi * was a new one for me , i must confess . 
  you 've also got [ nits ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43_bmtgpgkg ) ( the obligatory , * in the dutch mountains * ) . 
  i 've seen them play live a couple of times here in finland . 
  what a great band !, 
  listend to those kaczmarski songs , very powerful stuff !, 
  will listen to the others , as well . 
  thanks !, 
  ah , yes , they 're good !, 
  some finnish stuff i like : * scandinavian music group : [ h\u00f6lm\u00f6 rakkaus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkzcldm5fv4 ) * cmx : [ ruoste ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8mjkwa9lzo ) * ismo alanko : [ rakkaus on ruma sana ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyp9rasvwfc&amp;feature=related ) * kimmo pohjonen : [ keko ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usk1mjwqxoc ) edit : i thought of couple more : * circle : [ valerian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vegshx00b4w&amp;feature=related ) * 22-pistepirkko : [ birdy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrszat-jco ) * alamaailman vasarat : [ kebab tai henki !,

  well , you do have [ paolo conte ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smdncjbdtea&amp;feature=related ) . 
  wow , almost correct !, 
  it 's * apple * garden , not * pear * !, 
  not even close . 
  * mainos * means ad ( vertisement ) , so there might be some sort of trolling going on ... edit : ah , you enbettered your answer . 
  * ja * actually means `` and '' . 
  hooray !, 
  i think this is a draw . 
  ha , one point !, 
  wildly beyond my expectations . 
  did n't understand anything . 
  as already established on couple of trips to hungary . 
  i 'm guessing that `` mit '' is `` what '' -- `` mit\u00e4 '' in finnish . 
  i guess you are right . 
  the parts come all over the world and they are mostly assembled in china . 
  all the design , r&d for hardware/software and marketing ( ! ), 
  is still done in the u.s. tabasco it is then . 
  and i 've upgraded ( memory & ssd ) my laptops with non-apple parts a few times in the past . 
  it 's funny how the haters claim that they use the same/similar parts as other pc manufacturers and yet you can only use apple parts when replacing them . 
  also the `` triple prices '' claim is complete bs . 
  i agree . 
  from what i 've seen their pricing in the us is not especially higher than many other brands , but in europe they still hold premium pricing . 
  good marketing , i guess . 
  yeah , i 've seen this kind of convoluted rubbish is the current truth and gospel on the internet . 
  especially among the people who have never ever owned a mac , so i know my answer is more or less pointless to you . 
  and yet i type . 
  i do n't speak for iphones , ipods etc. 
  but i 've used and owned mac desktops and laptops from the mid '90s and i 've had nothing but good experiences . 
  i have used windows machines for work , so i 'm not completely clueless about them either . 
  this laptop i 'm typing on now is more than eight years old and it 's still fine for my use . 
  bought it used and would still probably get a hundred or two if i were to sell it . 
  you can probably guess that i 'm not a `` gamer '' , but this still has enough juice for my use . 
  some see apple as a scammy company which peddles in image and lifestyle , but through my own experience i see their computers and operating systems as durable and well designed tools i just prefer over others . 
  use whatever tools you like . 
   not weerd , its hated for the same reason bien\u017ever is hated . 
  i have no idea what that is . 
   its a shity product and stupid ppl dont know it more drivel . 
  yeah , i 've seen a lot of futile anger directed towards apple . 
  it 's weird . 
  i still consider it a premium brand .
