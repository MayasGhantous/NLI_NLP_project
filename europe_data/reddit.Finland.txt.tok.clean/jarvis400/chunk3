  ( i understand it can be used for other departures , as well . ), 
  edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/see_a_man_about_a_dog, 
  you have nice shoes . 
  heh , that sounds pretty much like in finland . 
  a few women i know now insist on cheek kissing ( how many ? 
  two or three ? 
  apparently the swiss and the dutch do three ... ) or that fake `` air kissing '' . 
  i 'm perpetually clueless about these things . 
  manner !, 
  any particular points that were more confusing than others ? 
  another one : ** kuha on : ** pyydyst\u00e4 kuha . 
  although the site is produced by * the finland promotion board * , i thought that the piece was rather well written and accurate , imo . 
  have something similar from denmark ? 
  ha , we have a similar one in finnish : * `` jos t\u00e4dill\u00e4 olis munat , se olis set\u00e4 . 
  '' * which translates to : * `` if aunt had balls she would be uncle . 
  many thanks !, 
  `` the owls are not what they seem . '', 
  is there really a greek saying that translates to ; * `` there is trouble in the gypsy village '' * , meaning * `` i do n't care '' / `` nobody cares '' * ? 
  saw this once on tv ( qi ) and it left me wondering if it 's true . 
  cheers !, 
  ah , seems that you got the basics right !, 
  i have n't been to latvia yet , what would be the similar things to know about latvia ? 
  finland . 
  ( nobody would feel finland an easy country to assimilate to . 
  i just typed that for finns who like to ctrl-f their own country in / r/europe posts . ), 
  yeah , a good idea . 
  that 's where most of them are holed up . 
  i wonder if it was [ ian ] ( http://youtu.be/olpqmw2xjmc?t=13m18s ) ? 
  i got it : `` my hovercraft if full of eels . '', 
  that 's a good idea !, 
  actually the irish have already asked about the bear . 
  there are few of them in helsinki . 
  ah , i have n't had the pleasure yet . 
  i wish we had an enormous bear that would hunt and kill ( only ) those busybodies in our government and ministries who introduce and impose petty rules and bans upon our people . 
  * run you you fucking soulless meddlers , here comes the bear !, 
  me too . 
  perhaps you are right . 
  but if we are talking about weapons grade fish , i think that the swedes win with their [ surstr\u00f6mming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surstr%c3%b6mming ) . 
  their * [ brunost ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21141244 ) * is a wmd . 
  it also tastes bad . 
  and it 's not technically even cheese . 
  ah , typical . 
  we are lead by the least among us . 
   good on sweden for actually having morals , while my own country just ca n't wait to participate in another war with our friends overseas , without un-mandate . 
  holy fuck , really ? 
  oh , i agree with your much more insightful comment . 
  it 's not like elop took over a healthy company , nokia was already in nosedive , riddled with bad software decisions - or what some might call -- indecision . 
   i 'm not a huge fan of our finnish one , i must say . 
  we should change it to sibelius ' finlandia instead . 
  i agree !, 
  me too . 
  many finns smelled a ~ ~ rat ~ ~ mole when stephen elop ( formerly of microsoft ) was chosen as the new ceo . 
  many thought he was sent on a mission to acquire nokia mobiles for microsoft . 
  it appears that they were right . 
  about the elk/moose - dilemma : http://www.thelocal.se/48736/20130627/, 
  it 's a mistranslation , i think . 
  finnish name for a deep cooking dish is * kattila * . 
  it appears that we got the word from a germanic language :  the word kettle originates from old norse ketill `` cauldron '' . 
  the old english spelling was \u010betel with initial che - [ t\u0283 ] like ` cherry ' , middle english ( and dialectal ) was chetel , both come ( together with german kessel `` cauldron '' ) ultimately from germanic * katilaz , that was borrowed from latin catillus , diminutive form of cat\u012bnus `` deep vessel for serving or cooking food '' , [ 2 ] which in various contexts is translated as `` bowl '' , `` deep dish '' , or `` funnel '' . 
  the photog said that she left the ~ ~ kettle ~ ~ pot , but did find a small picture frame . 
  here 's a brit/german relay joke : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48aumxifan8 ( i know i play this game wrong . ), 
  apparently we do have one , although it 's an inland fjord and thus nothing like norway 's fjords . 
  yeah , they treat these letters as * r\u00f6ck d\u00f6ts * . 
  two consecutive different vowels is a challenge for many anglophones ; `` tolkein '' , `` herion '' etc. 
   sorry to let you down , but i am not british . 
  ah , i wonder where i got that idea . 
  i do n't know if that 's standard finnish humor , perhaps a bit more on the retarded side . 
  i have great respect for british humour and i regularly follow several brit programs and i 'm absolutely hooked on your comedy panel shows . 
  what i think we do have in common , is the understatement and self-deprecation . 
  but we also have a heritage of eastern love for misery and suffering in a slow motion . 
  example : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfg9xopkk, 
  dolan , too !, 
  oh , get a room , you two . 
  thanks for the links . 
  seems that part of the finnish * sisu * could have been generated by smack or speed . 
  [ the finnish dragoons will assist . 
  i thought as much . 
  very clever . 
  cheers . 
  we are led by the least among us . 
  ( is this analogous to eli5 ? ), 
  thanks . 
  i genuinely did n't get it . 
  but did he do it on porpoise ? 
  he tried * what * ? 
  yea , you pretty much got it . 
  i think . 
  my swedish is not too good . 
  '' ... i would like to go to the lobby bar . '', 
  i meant `` civil servant '' being her name as in : `` hej , jag heter cybill shepherd , och jag skulle vilja g\u00e5 till lobbybaren '', 
  yeah , it 's true in theory , but in practice people who have passed the `` swedish for civil servants '' - exam , may not be able to say much more than : * `` hej , jag heter civil servant '' * . 
  but i agree , it was nice that [ olli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olli_rehn ) said it in both official languages . 
  heh , yes , the lesser known alkie moomin . 
  we better ask this noone fella , then . 
  i noticed there 's an explanation of this elk/moose conundrum at the bottom of the page : http://www.thelocal.se/48736/20130627/, 
  thanks !, 
  well , the sheep in this story were used to more loving encounters . 
  encounters apparently so frequent that they had been conditioned to the sound of a zipper . 
  heh , have you ever tried to drown a man made of cork ? 
  it was an attempt at humor .
