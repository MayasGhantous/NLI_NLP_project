  as was the sheep anecdote . 
  thanks , very kind of you . 
  i will . 
  * lovely country with lovely people . 
  * liked the soda bread and strong tea in the mornings , and good stout and whiskey in the evenings . 
  * of the cities i preferred cork over dublin . 
  saw a newspaper headline `` cork man drowned '' there . 
  * some parts of ireland are still fairly rural . 
  i was once cycling in county donegal and needed to take a piss . 
  i stopped and climbed over a squat stone fence to a pasture . 
  when i opened my fly , the sheep stopped grazing and some of them started to ~ ~ back up ~ ~ reverse towards me . 
  this was about twenty years ago . 
  i do n't know if they are so hospitable still . 
  * flann o'brian and the third policeman, 
  great country and wonderful people . 
  my favorite obscure fact about estonia is , that in the mid 18th century a black man was appointed as the superintendent of reval ( tallinn ) by peter the great . 
  he was also alexander pushkin 's great-grandfather .

   ... you share some zig zaggy border bit with finland due to a lighthouse ... 
  yes , finns build a lighthouse on the swedish side of the border . 
  a hundred years later the problem was fixed with rather elegant solution . 
  `` johnny , more whiskey ? '', 
  `` just a little , cheers . 
  do you have jameson 's ? '', 
  i would like to have some gin ! '', 
  i think this is a really great write up on the winter war : http://ar.to/2010/08/red-blood-white-snow  planning for the tremendous scope of the coming casualties , they pondered with a grim optimism and not a little dark humour , * `` they are so many , and our country is so small , where shall we find room to bury them all ? 
  that lolland has always sounded a fun place to me . 
  least healthy , casually violent and communicate in moonspeak . 
  there should be an exchange drunk program between our arcane lands . 
  thanks , was n't aware of / r/doesnottranslate . 
  you have drawn fins . 
  it 's true . 
  also , the cause . 
  drinking long drink in long johns all day long here . 
  tahiti is not enough ? 
  oh , absolutely !, 
  please take my answer in similar way . 
  cheers !, 
  cheers !, 
  i 'll spend one incredibly angry evening listening to these . 
  will probably get drunk , too .

   and i 've met a woman in turku who did n't speak any english . 
  yeah , * her * , sorry about that . 
  we have been trying to force her to take the lessons , but all to no avail . 
  there 's even been some talk about deporting her back to poland , but we shall see how things turn out . 
  he 's probably having a sesure . 
  thanks , bot !, 
  what a pleasant surprise . 
  i 'm afraid i 've noticed this , as well . 
  although i believe it 's mostly just one sad idiot . 
  `` unfrustratedbro '' gets banned and `` carl_sagan_bravery '' appears , and so it goes . 
  i can only hope that he will go with dutch flair in his next incarnation . 
  / r/canada voted [ , and got rid of him ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/wvhks/the_mods_say_we_should_vote_on_whether_or_not_we/ ) . 
  i quit putting powder in my coffee , it gave me heartburn . 
  that 's right , it 's not even technically cheese and is [ really dangerous stuff ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/23/170057690/burning-cheese-closes-norwegian-road-for-days ) , too . 
  one of our tourist boards should use this . 
  * `` norway : the home of the green nightmarish hovering portals '' * . 
  it just rolls off the tongue and is very enticing . 
  only amateurs vomit on their shoes . 
  that 's why you do the [ tactical chunder ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/qi#episode_g.14_.22greeks.22 ) . 
  it does look odd . 
  for instance , a [ couple ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_homicide_rate ) of [ sources ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/crime_trends_in_detail#homicide_.28table_3.29 ) show twice as high numbers for finland when compared to sweden . 
  true . 
  although `` finlandia '' gets me every time , as well . 
  may i ask if you have read the book * finland : the country of white lilies * by grigory petrov ? 
  i understand that many turkish people get their favorable attitude towards finland from this book . 
   according to unconfirmed reports , the meteorite was intercepted by an air defense unit at the urzhumka settlement near chelyabinsk . 
  a missile salvo blew the meteorite to pieces at an altitude of 20 kilometers , local newspaper znak reports quoting a source in the military . 
  regnum news agency quoted a military source who claimed that the vapor condensation trail of the meteorite speaks to the fact that the meteorite was intercepted by air defenses . 
  i somehow find this hard to believe . 
  yeah , that 's them . 
  the editor of this august publication is on the left . 
  some info here : http://minimalissimo.com/2012/06/kamppi-chapel-of-silence/ http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/intarch/2010/kamppichapel-27/index.html and , no , i do n't find it ugly at all . 
  yes , this finally proves that santa is indeed from finland !, 
  i wonder if your nils holgersson is as widely recognized ... 
  that 's right . 
  the kalevala ( according to scott sandwich ) told in nine minutes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzhf-acniyw, 
  well , i do n't know about that ... [ tujurikkuja 4 `` hiidansip vs hiidhalonen '' hd \\ ( click on the eng subtitles \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2adv6pkgfna ), 
  did someone call for a polar bear expert ? 
  yeah , i 'm not one either ... 
  i was looking for those photos , cheers !, 
  lihamuki , one of the life 's simple pleasures in lahti . 
  yeah , i guess it is . 
  but i do n't think we actually are that stabby anymore . 
  at least , i 'm not . 
  have n't stabbed anyone in ages . 
   source : i lived and studied there for several years . 
  four long years . 
  obviously there are many good people living there , but the prevailing atmosphere is that of gloom , disappointment and despair . 
  much better , thanks !, 
  self-deprecating humour has its time and place . 
  yet another fucking daily mail article here . 
  heh , a good idea , but maybe there are not enough idiotic hijinks for a new sub . 
  is there a similar area in hungary perceived in such a way ? 
  incidentally , a good part of lahti 's population are descendants of refugees moved from karelia after the war . 
  11 % of finnish population had to move to west . 
  that place is like a mini florida in the sense that if someone does something fully retarded , there 's a very good chance it took place in lahti . 
  great photos .
