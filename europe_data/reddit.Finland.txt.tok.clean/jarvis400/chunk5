  looks like a nice place to visit . 
  the film * children of men * . 
  highly recommended . 
  we have room here in helsinki refugee centre . 
  this is correct . 
  nothing to get riled up over . 
  unless you really want to . 
  and who does n't like a bit of righteous indignation in the morning . 
  what 's next ? 
  burqas for everyone and sharia laws in kindergartens !, 
  what !, 
  we have to wear habits now !? 
  but seriously , thanks for clarification . 
  i agree with you , this is certainly being blown out of proportion, 
  i remember being terrified when reading that part in the book . 
  was an adult when the cartoons came along . 
  another nordic children 's book that was rather too dark for me was [ `` br\u00f6derna lejonhj\u00e4rta '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_brothers_lionheart ) by astrid lindgren . 
  now that 's some heavy shit for a six year old . 
  tee-hee , that was good !, 
  that 's brilliant !, 
  all of the sudden daily mail `` articles '' are ok info ? 
  is n't there a norwegian fish oil company called m\u00f6ller 's ? 
  yeah , i 'll msg you when/if it 's approved . 
  last word i submitted took a couple of days . 
  cheers !, 
  i submitted it and it 's under review . 
  good point , i added it . 
  oh yeah , good point . 
  did n't mean to take credit for it . 
  i 'll submit it . 
  how about this : * metrorefugee * * `` a young single male economic migrant that crosses european borders in style . 
  acid-washed jeans , fitted t-shirts and flip flops is his typical attire . 
  '' * any suggestions ? 
  i think we 're decided . 
  * metrorefugee * it is . 
  what you mean , `` mean '' ? 
  `` one direction ( north-west ) '' is a great name !, 
   one-way ticket home via sweden . 
  they do have a certain disheveled boy band looks . 
  `` men ii boyz '' `` eastlife '' `` let us go-gos '' `` fasttrax5 '', 
   i guess it 's just a throwback to the nazi-era propaganda playing on sexual fear ? 
  oh man , i hope you are you joking . 
  many thanks for your input .

  well , our prime minister promised his villa for refugees to live in . 
  also , pretty blondes . 
  [ a google translation from an al-arabiya article ] ( http://i.imgur.com/croz4rs.png ) . 
  thanks for the correction , spin0 !, 
  makes much more sense when the offer is to send soldiers instead of navy . 
  ah , the [ mistrals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) !, 
  i 'm sure the guys ( ten for each ) would love to take them for spin , but they may be a tad too big for the purpose . 
  good thinking . 
  [ anything ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vwdcgoh.gifv ) is helpful . 
  have a boat we could borrow ? 
  right . 
  i 'll have to get the plasma rifle from the attic . 
  ah , that !, 
  please , tell us , what begins now ? 
  your nick is relevant . 
  somliga g\u00e5r med trasiga skor is one of my favorite songs . 
  this is a classic !, 
  also , a true story . 
  two swedes are on a cruise on the river nile . 
  the other one sees crocodiles sliding into the water , he points and says to the other : `` look !, 
  i did n't know lacoste makes canoes ! '', 
  ok , then . 
  you see something there that i do n't . 
  yeah yeah , some people just love to post this fucking revelation over and over again . 
  yle is like bbc , it produces programming all the finns , even for minorities . 
  even in latin . 
  i does n't say anywhere that their ** news ** should be pro-minorities etc. 
  me too . 
  i think since you cut your benefits for asylum seekers , finland could be a better deal . 
  if you look at just the money grants . 
  at the moment : * a single ( including single parent ) adult asylum seeker in finland receives an allowance of $ 316,07 / month ( $ 92,64 / month if meals are included in the accommodation ) * other adults ( couples , i guess ) receive $ 267,02 / month ( $ 76,29 / month if meals are included in the accommodation ) but just today there was a report that the government is planning to cut these benefits and will add mandatory language training and tests etc. 
  or , maybe they [ saw this article in al arabiya ] ( https://i.imgur.com/iqvre82.png ) . 
  it does read like a travel brochure . 
  even the prime minister gives his `` dacha '' for refugees to live . 
  and look at those babes !, 
  speaking of * actual * refugees . 
  what 's your take on these poor things ? 
  here 's a clip from today 's hs ( the biggest daily newspaper in finland ) site . 
  it 's shot in [ haparanda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haparanda ) in the northern sweden . 
  it 's a border town to finland , which is just across the river . 
  the old geezer : `` these buses all arrive full every afternoon . 
  the people do n't seem to know where they are coming from or way they are going . '', 
  the ticket seller says that they have been arriving daily from lule\u00e5 for two - two and a half weeks now . 
  they buy tickets to destinations in finland , to kemi and oulu mostly . 
  the headline says they were from iraq . 
  there 's an empty hotel in haparanda transformed to a refugee center , but no one wants to stay there . 
  hey , this is sort of relevant . 
  a fun fact i learned today about bulgaria and refugees : during the wwii bulgaria saved almost all of its jewish population , despite germany 's demands of deportation . 
  yep . 
  i hope that undecided refugees do n't read these sites . 
  it did sound really odd indeed . 
  i wonder why he had to mention that point at all . 
  blame shifting ? 
  `` look , we are not to blame . 
  it 's the refugees that are coming ! '', 
  this article in hs actually has pretty much the same quote than op 's story :  stubb perusteli verojen korottamista sill\u00e4 , ett\u00e4 maahanmuuttajien kulut nousevat .
