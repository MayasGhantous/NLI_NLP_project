  i 'm thinking the yellow press is going to have a field day tomorrow . 
  edit : business insider has picked this up , too :  finland 's government on thursday proposed increasing capital gains tax and income tax on high earners to help pay for a 10-fold increase in refugees expected to arrive this year , its finance minister said .

  good one !, 
  switzerland is probably closest . 
  it practices direct democracy in parallel with representative democracy . 
  i agree with you that the article and the headline give a really slanted picture of the budget negotiations and of the following press info . 
  the rising cost of the refugees is certainly not the most important part of the budget , and yet that was the only quote chosen for the article . 
  however , stubb did say that and the translation was correct , imo . 
  any real ( buffalo ) mozzarella will secure you a doctorate . 
  also , [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jqduk62.jpg ) 's something to think about . 
  yeah , i 'm not on the `` let them all immigrate '' - train myself , but seeing correlation  causation in some old graph is a just stupid . 
  [ here 's another graph that is quite interesting . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s2jlkgf.png ) ( source http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations ), 
  [ what is in a steady rise ?

  ah , that 's right !, 
  i read about this some time ago . 
  `` sexualbrott '' in swedish law usage also include the purchase of sexual services . 
  i wonder if these are included in numbers of the graph . 
  according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden#sex_crimes the number of actual rape cases has n't risen in recent years , and is at about the same level as most european countries . 
  their legislation makes international comparison rather tricky , though . 
  edit : since many will apparently see this i 'd like to point to a / u/not _ swedish_spy 's comment that has a link to a bbc article that explains the situation well : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kdhrn/sexual_offences_in_sweden_19752013_chart/cuwqlqo, 
  i 'm not even close to being fluent in swedish , but i know that `` sexualbrott '' here includes the purchase of sexual services , as well . 
  this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden#sex_crimes explains the actual situation rather well , imo . 
  according to that , the number of actual rape cases has n't risen in recent years .

   `` half the country and the government they support are bigots . 
  this is n't a hyperbole ; it 's a statistical fact . '', 
  this is brilliant , thanks !, 
  we 'll use that when we do our own `` do n't come here '' - ads in finland . 
  maybe put that snowy `` meanwhile in finland '' - guy photo in , too ... 
  thanks , i 'm aware of that you can cross by bus , but i answered to this comment :  all the while sweden makes crossing border to finland by train easier for paperless people . 
  he linked to an article which says that sj personnel are no longer asking ids when refugees are buying a ticket or when presenting their tickets to a train conductor . 
  i 'm hardly a pro-immigration , but as the schengen is apparently no longer working , that rail company policy decision has absolutely zero effect on the difficulty on how these paperless people supposedly would travel to finland . 
  i understand that there has n't been any passenger railway traffic between sweden and finland in many years . 
  heh , that is indeed a classic . 
  i myself saw it very recently , but ca n't remember where . 
  come on , now !, 
  underdose is a serious danger in homeopathic drugs . 
  this is a very good point . 
  well , i guess we read these news differently then . 
  i 'm certainly not without bias in choosing the news sources i read . 
  it should be said that yle produces a lot of other programming than news and current affairs . 
  in finnish , swedish , english , sami , and fucking latin . 
  no matter how much you want to twist that part of the law you quoted , it does n't actually say that news should be biased multiculturalism in mind . 
  that 's absolute twattery and you know it . 
  i 've seen a few of them , but this is great . 
  thanks !, 
  the lead actor has played a gym teacher before : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zla2fzaxekc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=50s, 
  i thought that was rather weak . 
  yeah , but they also do a lot of good . 
  like that old medicine to help morphine addicts , namely heroin \u2122 . 
  yeah , it 's not much . 
  much less than i thought . 
  two adults and three kids . 
  i just tried to figure out the finnish numbers . 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  did n't get an answer yet . 
  thanks , i did just that . 
  that 's odd . 
  i did n't delete my comment and can still see it when i 'm logged in . 
  when i log out it shows as [ deleted ] ... 
  the figures cited in that news article are with free housing but no free meals . 
  the allowance is indeed smaller if free meals are offered . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i 'm presently unemployed and have a little more than half of that per month to spend . 
  ** edit ** : i looked up the benefit amounts for single asylum seekers in finland and there 's a news article from today that cites them : * a single ( including single parent ) adult asylum seeker in finland receives an allowance of $ 316,07 / month ( $ 92,64 / month if meals are included in the accommodation ) * other adults ( couples , i guess ) receive $ 267,02 / month ( $ 76,29 / month if meals are included in the accommodation ) that 's much less than a finnish citizen gets in unemployment etc. 
  benefits . 
  yep , i added it . 
  yes , that 's a typical monthly cash allowance ** for a family of five ** . 
  accommodation and very basic healthcare is free . 
  this varies some between the countries . 
  and yes , i 'm sure there are pensioners that receive much less after rent etc. 
  obviously they do n't have to sleep dormitories , either . 
  just for comparison , [ here 's figures for the nordic countries from a week ago .

  lidl less conversation , lidl more action , please . 
  lidl less conversation , lidl more action . 
  thanks for your answer . 
  great series !, 
  sort of dystopic and dark , but really well done . 
  sadly only two seasons were made . 
  edit : there are two other recent programmes with the same name , but it 's this one here : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2384811/, 
  i hope you are right , and i tend to agree with many of your points . 
  we just need to hope that putin is n't first class psychopath . 
  thanks for your thoughts !, 
  i thought it was too violent for my tastes . 
  [ utopia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01vgtx9xfh0 ) is much more pleasant . 
  braquo is great !, 
  the premise reminded me of the shield , but this was much better done . 
  heh , that 's what i thought . 
  damn those treehuggers . 
  here 's another shot of [ putintin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/seb6aw1.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not a smart man , but i 'm starting to think that putin 's game is to see if he can disband nato . 
  or at least to make it harder for new states to become members . 
  of course , at least historically , stirring the shit abroad can only make his domestic approval better .
