  here 's a terrible and hopefully unlikely `` what if ? 
  '' : say , the ethnic russian majority living in narva , estonia are claimed of being terrorised by the estonian government or its people . 
  first there are demos , fights , even some shots fired . 
  more shootings , where one or two russians die . 
  some think that the shot came from across the river . 
  more estonian troops are deployed in the area . 
  there will be some local resistance for a while , but then they start to get help across the river from the russian side . 
  guns , ammo , little green men , even . 
  typically , from russia there would be no clear war declaration , just your thinly veiled threats to step in and save their native sons and daughters from the slaughter , perhaps even using smallish nukes would n't be completely of the question ... at what point would nato step in ? 
  would all the nato members agree on invoking the article 5 ? 
  if they would not , what is it good for ? 
  apparently it 's done all the time . 
  hey , here 's some footage : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5s44a8uieq, 
  i 'm pretty sure you are confusing real life global politics with hollywood films . 
   yes , i think somehow he was silently banned from our media [ ... ] that 's actually the best way to deal with him . 
  the last news i read about the wanker was him paying for [ this idiot 's ] ( http://www.kouvolansanomat.fi/online/2015/07/31/petri%20viljakainen%20l%c3%a4hti%20pieks%c3%a4m%c3%a4elt%c3%a4%20taistelemaan%20it%c3%a4-ukrainaan/2015519373201/4 ) flights and visa to donetsk . 
  and hopefully b\u00e4ckman is visiting when it does . 
  that , too !, 
  my favourite history fact about tallinn ( well , reval ) is that for ten years in the 18th century it had a superintendent who was a black man named gannibal . 
  nooooooo !, 
  [ israel exposed !, 
  ~ ~ hurra ! ~ ~ ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ pm ^ ^ ^ you . 
  after carefully examining the evidence i have to say that i believe this , too . 
  that really boggles the mind . 
  i just read about another , oddly unsolved crime spree in you country : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brabant_killers, 
  i think all these olof palme-streets around the world prove that the conspiracy is a global one . 
  it 's been said that the dwellers in these places leave no shadow . 
  [ hell , even their plasters are racist . 
  that 's a good question . 
  sweden and norway ( iceland too , i think ) have similar politics about alcohol and the state monopoly . 
  we even had a full alcohol prohibition around the same time as the us did . 
  it did n't work at all , as is typical for these laws . 
  it 's not likely for religious reasons , because all the nordics are quite secular . 
  then again , all ( i think ) share a similar notion of `` lutheran work ethics '' which has not much room for drinking ( or much other kind of fun , either ) . 
  most likely it has formed during the early years of a newish welfare state which had the social safety net , and on the flipside strict rules on what you are supposed to do . 
  heavy drinking was obviously seen as costly for the state , but yet a nice flow income in alcohol taxes . 
  this is just speculating , though . 
  i have n't actually studied the subject . 
  hey , you guys take drinking seriously !, 
  i mean i understand that it makes sense and in the same time is a friendly thing to do . 
  being from another country that is ~ ~ sometimes ~ ~ ~ ~ often ~ ~ always considered a nation of drinkers i realised how and why this nice custom is less common here in finland , and why we have done things so differently , and still do . 
  old laws , and customs learned from these rules , and heavy taxation by the state . 
  right up to the '80s there were n't any bars or pubs where people could fetch their own drinks . 
  that 's right , strict nordic-style licensing laws said that people almost always were served their drinks while seated at their tables . 
  if you ordered a g&t the server brought you 4cl ( that 's less than `` half a glass '' ! ), 
  of gin in the highball class , ice in a different container , and tonic water in a small jug . 
  in a more upscale place you got a slice of lemon . 
  then they mixed these ingredients in front of you as it were some kind of fucking magic trick . 
  i think that the reasoning behind this charade was that the bar staff could n't pour you shy measures . 
  and also that the staff could monitor your level of inebriation . 
  drunken people were not served . 
  and yet everyone was drunk . 
  in a more international establishment , such as a hotel lobby bar , you may have been allowed to wander about a bit . 
  when finland got to the late '80s ( this happened in the early '90s ) you were allowed to fetch your own drinks from the bar where typically everyone was lining up in a moaning , but oddly orderly queue . 
  behind the bar there was always a sign `` jokainen hakee juomansa itse . 
  '' , which , as you probably guessed , means `` everyone fetches their own drinks . '', 
  not in plural , mind , you still got one drink per person . 
  you could n't take a few to your friends , because most likely you did n't have any friends at all and were going to drink all those expensive stale lagers yourself . 
  and get drunk . 
  at least that was the reasoning behind the rules . 
  i think . 
  the rules and bylaws are much more lax now but the price of drink is still fairly high and it 's still a rare sight that someone gets a trayful of drinks from the bar for others . 
  it does happen , and many people might have their own rounds for their close friends . 
  just a few thoughts on why this lovely custom is not as prevalent here in finland . 
  yeah , that 's what i like about your country and the people . 
  you can be acerbic and sarcastic -- in a good way . 
  even the most serious topics can have this crooked-humour vibe about them . 
  just watched `` calvary '' again . 
  i think that ~ ~ film ~ ~ fillum is a good example that humour can and must exist in all aspects of life and death . 
  i think we finns have something like that , but are much slower and stolid about it . 
  ha , i sort of knew it . 
  well written , i thought . 
  that 's why i had it saved . 
  ok , thought as much . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , i 'm sure that buying drinks in turn is common but the system described in the linked post sounded fairly complicated , and perhaps serious . 
  is the ` rounds system ' really like described here ? 
  : https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/yu21u/hello_rireland_im_a_17_year_old_sophomore_at_a/c5zdtxm i think i own you a few drinks . 
  next time . 
  that aftonbladet link does n't open for me , but i found this : http://www.thelocal.se/20150810/teenage-swedish-couple-held-by-isis-in-syria, 
  was his komboloi huge ? 
  ( yes i know now that komboloi means `` worry beads '' . ), 
  grazie for recommendation , i 'll keep graz in mind . 
  i liked tartu and cork . 
  i apparently enjoy second cities . 
  much funnier !, 
  yeah , i had n't seen that when i posted this . 
  will not post immigration things in the future . 
  killing me softly with this bong . 
  hey , whatever floats your goat . 
  is that * brunost * ? 
  it looks like [ semtex ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tkwvxm9.jpg ) and is a cheese in name only . 
  and like semtex , it can be very dangerous : http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/01/23/170057690/burning-cheese-closes-norwegian-road-for-days, 
  i agree , a great country and fine people . 
  this is not widely advertised but our two countries have a drunk exchange program . 
  i myself was sent to co. . donegal for a year or two in the late '90s . 
  i think it was closer to three , actually . 
  good news , indeed !, 
  how much should we tip ? 
  same pilot in both crashes .
