  ca n't apparently be proven , but the perpetrators are most likely russian . 
  `` a group of cork men drowned in the vltava . '', 
  sure did . 
  he was also mentioned in the article i linked . 
  i may look that book up , thanks . 
  good points , all . 
  i 've always liked that g\u00f6ring quote on patriotism . 
  well , fuck-ups are not generally advertised either . 
  heh , a bad choice of name , indeed . 
  you usually can hear an approaching lada from afar . 
  i think you are right . 
  this reminded me of an adam curtis article on how incapable secret services can be . 
  it has great examples of huge fuck-ups by mi5 : http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/3662a707-0af9-3149-963f-47bea720b460, 
  oh , i think we do , but i was thinking more in the lines how shit-stirring and warmongering is generally beneficial for * everyone * in the arms industry . 
   nobody really knows how strong is putin 's hold on power . 
  everyone seems to forget , that he did n't just come out of nowhere and took the power from yeltzin . 
  putin was assigned by the same people , who forced yeltzin to step down . 
  oh , i agree . 
  i think it 's a mistake if we think putin as a single autocrat who holds all the power . 
   of course it 's possible , vladimir already took care of the people who brought him to power and remained the only one on this internal russian battlefield with absolutely no group to challenge him ever , but i would be surprised if that was the case . 
  agreed again . 
  seems very unlikely . 
  i 'm just reading an interesting article on the apartment-building bombings in moscow 1999 . 
   [ ... ] events moved very quickly after that . 
  on new year 's eve 1999 , boris yeltsin stunned the nation by announcing that he was stepping down from the presidency effective immediately , which made vladimir putin acting president until new elections could be held . 
  and instead of holding them sometime in the summer , as originally scheduled , those elections would now occur in just ten weeks ' time , leaving putin 's many competitors for the position little time to prepare . 
  in a presidential poll taken in august 1999 , putin had garnered less than 2 percent support . 
  by march 2000 , however , riding a wave of popularity for his total-war policy in chechnya , he swept into office with 53 percent of the vote . 
  the reign of vladimir putin had begun , and russia would never be the same . 
  http://reprints.longform.org/putin-conspiracy-banned-story-anderson i have n't yet made my mind on its credibility , but it 's interesting nonetheless . 
  i 'm not sure if russians even know or care about the current finnish budget discussions , or if our defense budget gets a slight bump . 
  from a finnish pov this may look like something that is directed towards us at this particular moment , but it just might be a co-incidence of one or two subs detected at this time . 
  i 'm not a smart man , but the older i get the less i believe in people or groups of people masterminding and/or conducting intricate plans . 
  yes , it certainly begins to look like like putin * wants * to antagonize all other nations . 
  maybe the gloomy cunt feels the need to consolidate his power in russia even more ? 
  maybe his buddies in the arms industry feel that this is a great way to expand arms sales ? 
  or perhaps this kind of sub activity has been going on all the time but we ( or the media ) have just started paying more attention ? 
  form the [ reuters article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/28/us-finland-navy-iduskbn0nj0y120150428 ) :  the finnish military fired on tuesday handheld underwater depth charges as a warning against a suspected submarine in waters near helsinki , an incident that comes amid growing military tensions with neighboring russia . 
   the navy said it noticed an underwater target on monday and again on tuesday morning and fired some warning charges - the size of grenades .

  i just saw this [ really good road safety fillum from ireland . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blnbk2r3fja ), 
  ah , this helps putting it in perspective . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  an another one from them . 
  click `` cc '' for english lyrics , i watch this weekly and still do n't quite understand . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aadjmpaheye i guess is about whining . 
  fucking great production , though . 
  national self-depcrepation purraps ? 
   making a cup of coffee is like making love to a beautiful woman . 
  it 's got to be hot . 
  you 've got to take your time . 
  you 've got to stir ... gently and firmly . 
  you 've got to grind your beans until they squeak . 
  and then you put in the milk .

   brendan gleeson he 's great !, 
  i just re-watched the guard and have calvary lined up . 
  also , `` hobo with a shotgun '', 
  those two should battle . 
  i 'm going to use that phrase everywhere . 
  `` man can do what he wills but he can not will what he wills . '', 
  `` is that because of flowers ? '', 
  true . 
  i just had my morning coffee down here in the shelter . 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wph7yeqyxvs, 
  finland has over 40,000 air-raid shelters which can house 3.8 million people ( 71 % of the population ) . 
  guess why ? 
  yeah , forgot about that . 
  i 've read that it can be unreasonably high for small businesses . 
  yet another way to encourage small enterprise . 
  i agree . 
  and the tax has the benefit of getting rid of the silly inspector charade . 
  we had exactly the same system till last year . 
  now it 's a tax of 50-140 euros depending on income . 
  ok , you may stay . 
  the finnish word for potato is * peruna * , derived from the old swedish word for potato ; * jordp\u00e4ron * . 
  ( in a similar fashion as * pomme de terre * and * aardappel * , i guess . ), 
  i 've heard some swedish speakers on the islands in sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdshavet still using just * p\u00e4ron * for potato . 
  machine elves . 
   the mainstream media will however . 
  it 's the same here in finland . 
  just this week a group of somali youths attacked a young woman and our largest newspaper ca n't even report that the attackers had a foreign background -- well they did in one article , but it was quickly redacted . 
  it 's absurd . 
  many people argue that the ethnicity or race is n't pertinent when reporting news . 
  yes , it fucking is . 
  heh , same here ( old git ) . 
  perhaps younger guys here shave . 
   northern europeans are hardly hairy like the italians/turks though , maybe that 's a factor ? 
  that 's a good point . 
  with all this variation in answers i suspect that this might be not be a regional , but a generational thing . 
  or lifestyle . 
  edit : just to add one more data point , i do n't know any guy that shaves his arm pits . 
  here in fin . 
   it 's more common to shave other body parts like legs , arms or shoulders . 
  interesting . 
  i have to say this surprised me a little . 
  i once met three german journeymen carpenters here in finland .
