  invincibility is the best ability . 
  but do you have proofs ? 
  good find !, 
  apparently yle has erased the article for some reason . 
  weird , looks like yle has pulled the article altogether . 
  i wonder what caused it . 
  probably putin 's orders . 
  https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://yle.fi/uutiset/estonian_president_plays_dj_set_at_trendy_helsinki_nightclub/8846749 `` estonian president plays dj set at trendy helsinki nightclub welcome to kaiku , one of helsinki 's trendiest nightclubs . 
  people lined up in a downpour to be able to listen to a dj play his favourite records for a sold out audience . 
  that 's not out of the ordinary for a place like this , but thursday night one of the dj happened to be the president of estonia . 
  president toomas ilves arrived fashionably late to the sold out venue , donning his trademark bow tie and for added street cred , a leather jacket . 
  the world leader is promoting a cd he curated called `` teenage wasteland - 16 early fave raves of the president , '' a compilation of classic rock songs . 
  proceeds from sales of the album are going to an estonian charity for very ill children . 
  the president 's collection includes favourites from artists of the 60s and 70s , like the four tops , the who , the velvet underground , david bowie and the ramones . 
  the charity my dream day ( minu unistuste p\u00e4ev ) aims to help chronically or terminally sick children fulfill their dreams . 
  ilves says that while he enjoys all types of music , he chose rock and roll as a vehicle to raise money because of its near-universal appeal . 
  `` we did a presentation in tallinn , and it was a big hit for people for some reason , i did n't really expect it , i was really shocked to see all these people come out , '' ilves said before the show on thursday . 
  `` and [ the album ] came out before christmas and a lot of people bought it so it 's really helped out the charity . 
  and then someone asked if i would do one in riga , latvia and i said ` ok , ' '' dj president adds ` pedagogical aspect ' `` i wanted to pick out things that i remember and like but also show a sort of a slightly historical or pedagogical aspect to it , '' ilves said . 
  the president spoke briefly before starting each song , describing the evolution of rock music and gave insights into the reasons why he chose them . 
  with the help of local celebrity musician sami yaffa in the dj booth , ilves said that punk rock was clearly influenced by his set 's first track , the 60s garage rock classic wild thing by the troggs . 
  he also made the connection between the 60s british invasion band the kinks and the 70s new york punk band the ramones , and so on . 
  it was n't all educational , however . 
  a few songs into his set , likely sensing the overt stillness on the packed dance floor , the president urged the well-behaved crowd to simply start dancing .

  thanks for your insight !, 
  yeah , i know . 
  i think . 
  hey , that 's same link i posted . 
  are there any good candidates for the next one ? 
  i think more estonians speak finnish than the other way around , but since i do n't speak estonian i always use english first when in estonia , especially with younger people . 
  apparently older people know finnish more often , whereas most younger people speak english . 
  when i try to read estonian i may understand a general gist of an article but not always . 
  this article ( in finnish ) has a few photos : http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/a1461826050601?jako=38f639bf6d200bbc2dcbe1c0455e5e3c&amp;ref=tw-share, 
  that 's actually really good . 
  the article is a bit more restrained than the headline , here 's the pertinent part :  although no political group has proposed a euro exit , some euro-sceptic parliamentarians cited lack of independent monetary policy as a problem and said finland should have held a referendum before adopting the euro in 1998 . 
  this was a [ citizens initiative ] ( http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=706 ) that collected more than 50 000 votes so the parliament has to look into it . 
  it 's supposedly tool for direct democracy but the parliament has no practical obligation to enact upon these initiatives . 
  i like labia . 
  i love this photo .

  good stuff !, 
  i was educated slightly and thoroughly entertained . 
  that noone fella is always in trouble . 
  can i ask you in which country it 's `` lybia '' instead of `` libya '' ? 
  i see this occasionally and i 'm curious . 
  thank you !,

  yes , `` you send them back '' but how many actually leave europe ? 
  is ireland taking a lot of migrants in ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  / r/askeurope is preferred sub for questions like this , you might have better luck there . 
  cheers !, 
  heh , this is fantastic , thanks !, 
   just look at 16:36 and see how they bury something looking like a ghoulish doll under one of those stones . 
  planting things for later to pretend they discover something sensational and get funding for some fraudulent archaeological research or black magic voodoo doll burying or both . [ puzzlin ' evidence !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcfyhnctsc ), 
  i 've seen both the vellum and the fillum . 
  they were quite good . 
  i agree with your assessment . 
  also , as you said in your other comment about our forests being essentially tree plantations , and yet we get high grades in `` biodiversity and habitat '' . 
  yeah , odd . 
  sweden seems to have a similar score . 
  yeah , that 's more like it . 
  edit : here 's finland 's grades : http://epi.yale.edu/country/finland apparently we have a really poor score ( rank 106 ) in forestry due to a high [ `` tree cover loss '' ] ( http://archive.epi.yale.edu/our-methods/forests#tab-1 ) . 
  that sounds alarming . 
  ahem , i know this is not a popular view but healthy people actually cost more in health expenditure during their lifetime . 
   the researchers found that healthy people cost governments more in the long run because they live years longer : an average of 4.5 years longer than people who are obese , and seven years longer than smokers .

  i wonder if there 's causation besides correlation . 
  thanks for your insight . 
  it 's a big kaka and there are slices for those who act fast . 
  d\u00e4nks onppu . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
   a country run by the extreme right . 
  i saw some similar headlines in the swedish press when the ( true ) finns were voted in the government . 
  i do n't like them personally , but some of the headlines made as if finland were going to be fascist . 
  thanks . 
  it 's a good business , indeed . 
  not so good for the taxpayer . 
  i 'm curious who is getting all this money in sweden ( besides the migrants themselves in cash allowances ) , i mean who organizes the accommodation , food , personel ( security , interpreters , health care , education etc. ), 
  for the newcomers ? 
  i 'm guessing that the state and the municipalities are legally bound in organizing all this , but i bet that private companies are providing the actual services ? 
  in finland there are a few big firms putting up these centers for migrants and providing the services needed . 
  many smaller outfits , as well . 
  they have mostly gotten the contracts without any kind of bidding contest because `` there 's no time '' . 
  very lucrative business where all kinds of firms make a good profit . 
  a license to print money , really . 
  many of these companies have shown to have connections in the incumbent ruling parties . 
  also it seems that the media does n't want to look into this too much . 
  same thing in sweden ? 
  i personally have learned that the good old question `` who benefits ? '', 
  is often a good one to ask . 
  one of the incumbent government party are finns ( formerly known as `` true finns '' , close to sd , but more moderate i guess ) , who got their government seats basically on a anti-immigration ticket . 
  once they got into power they have done shit all about their main issue , as is often the case with populist parties . 
  the two other two parties ( center and right ) and their buddies are grabbing the loose money and dream about the cheap labour they are letting in without too much scrutiny . 
  the prime minister even famously offered his own villa for refugee families to live in . 
  a major pr fuck up ( picked up even the arabic press ) which he has since tried hard to forget .
