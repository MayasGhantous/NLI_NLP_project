  you 're pretty much getting what you want . 
  could have wished for skp at 55 % while you were at it, 
  they are in government engaging in austerity , shitty health district reforms and some borderline corruption . 
  a drop was inevitable they would have dropped more if it were n't for their winning candidate in the first time helsinki mayoral race . 
  you win a silver medal in this debate , as a token for your persistence , coherence and ability to see through the lies of the libtards, 
  *** yawns ***, 
  seems as if you are more concerned with appearing `` strong '' than what actually works . 
  you really made no argument other than calling my argument `` pathetic '' . 
  bush regime used `` war on terror '' as one of many pretexts for the war in iraq https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rationale_for_the_iraq_war#combating_terrorism https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050628-7.html, 
   the right wing solution would to stop immigration from islamic countries would result in more hate from muslims , in extension more radicalization from the muslims that already live here  that was afghanistan bush regime used `` war on terror '' as one of many pretexts for the war in iraq https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rationale_for_the_iraq_war#combating_terrorism https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050628-7.html, 
  what is the rightist practice to solve problems with terrorism ? 
  i knew george bush invaded iraq because they were `` sheltering al-qaeda '' , islamists are doing a bit better than before , also a million people are dead . 
  any right wing solution is much worse than doing nothing, 
  i also think uber should follow the rules . 
  apro pos working conditions and unemployment . 
  if all of us in the west were working for pennies on the dollar unempoyment wouldnt be a problem . 
   i would really like too see evidence for how worker right 's and not increasing productivity has helped people get good working condition . 
  so your question is how have workers rights improved workers conditions ? 
  uhh i dont know how to respond to that lol, 
  a good day for workers rights, 
  yeah russians have a thing for authiritarians , but history is super vital witj all this stuff, 
  great leap forward is not unambiguously bad in the long term what was even your point again ? 
  russians are genetically bad at everything ? 
  so state controlled with all the negatives but none of the perks ? 
  you are missing the point . 
  the current russian capitalism is so cruel , corrupt and unequal that they are longing for economic security and/or a strong leader . 
  you oaf , china has 5 times the russian population and they didnt experience a government collapse inthe 90s where foreigners and oligarchs stole all the public funds . 
  if you wan na know why russia is so weak ask yeltsin . 
  as for germany , ever heard of the marshal plan ? 
  68 32 for mel3nchon according to polls , but what do they know ? 
  *** beep beep motherfucker , melenchon hype train comin through *** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_pqlxcgga, 
  i think there were negotiations that failed between them . 
  however then the roles were reversed now melenchon is ahead so its up to hamon . 
  he is at the left of ps so its not impossible that he would drop out and support melenchon, 
  dont think it has to do with su rather qith britosh polocy and franco, 
  she looks oretty evil though, 
  one might add , a brit who endorsed the iraq war with vigor, 
  name me a british kin , queen or prime minister that wasnt behind a single innocent death, 
  he reminds of a dictator is a futuristic dystopia, 
  if we are talking about terrorism let 's talk about america . 
  in this mil\u00f6enia you have started a war that killed almoat a million . 
  as well as bombing civilians over all the middle east and more . 
  just because its state supported doesnt make it different . 
  same goes for turkish bombings of kurds in iraq and syria as well as violence in south east turkey, 
  more than half of frencv people accepted the vichy government . 
  so relax it woth your gatekeeping, 
  i do n't know the age of my parents so i can relate tbh, 
  yeah basically this diplomatic conflict is completely meaningless . 
  it benefits certain factions in the netherlands ahead of their elections and improves erdogan 's chances of driving home his referendum . 
  eh , he is not up for re-election . 
  he could do whatever he thinks is best . 
  i 'm not sure europe putting up a united front against turks is very helpful , it would only drive up anti european sentiment and thus give erdogan a better chance at winning that tight referendum . 
  i 'm pretty sure this blocking of turks is a net positive for the yes campaign about the referendum . 
  being against quebecoise independence you mean ? 
  this way of thinking is so fucking dumb, 
  i agree with you brit friend . 
  at times the right wing media and the centrist as well just have a vicious campaign against him . 
  he is best friends with hezbollah one day , the other he hates the queen because he wo n't bow enough ( this one is so infuriating ) , the other he wo n't sing the anthem . 
  it 's basically a parade of bullshit . 
  as an outsider to britain i think i can judge these things quite well , a little distance from a culture is good to evaluate it . 
  the reasons for this campaign are quite transparent . 
  he represents a true critique of the order of contemporary britain , militarism , monarchism , the class system , corporate power etc. 
  this is a threat to the power forces of privatization and globalization that seek to concentrate power away from the state and to corporate entities . 
  this is why the news media , a conduit to the capitalist power is running 24/7 smear campaigns against him . 
  i wo n't shed any tears for war profiteers who accidentally helped some people, 
  3000 is equal to 5 in ww2 deaths, 
  the syrian government does have gigantic prison , or concentration camps . 
  libya is in a state of civil war . 
  obviously it 's not the same but it 's very comparable . 
   denmark  ww2 like five people in denmark were killed during the war, 
  other than that they were different ? 
  mein kampf and the communist mainifesto are really not equivalent at all . 
  you would need a fundamental lack of understanding of the texts to think that they are . 
  millions of deaths from starvation under capitalism is an unfortunate accident due to corruption in developing countries . 
  millions of death from starvation is an engineered catastrophe designed to genocide the capitalist ukrainians . 
  any other version of events is stalinist propaganda , get in line, 
  back in the day the knife fighting alcoholic people who came to work in factories from a weird eastern country was seen as the problem . 
  despite being the biggest minority they had no language rights or anything . 
  the land of those people ? 
  ? ... finland really activates your almonds does n't it ? 
  if i were to be born in a former soviet country it would czecia, 
  we should not be reliant on a political party easily corruptible by the allure of state power to act in a humanitarian way . 
  the hierarchical structures that have placed the west in a position to give mercy or be cruel to those of conflict ridden areas should be torn down . 
  i know their most certainly is a lot of hypocrisy involved , but sweden consists of more than one person . 
  i know you probably hate liberals kropotkin , but some of them are genuine and well meaning . 
  but yeah that humanitarian super power delusional stuff is a bit funny . 
   that 's just shitty self-righteous bullshit that they parroted for long time i think many of them meant it . 
  they shut the border yes , but not before a lot of people were allowed in . 
  they still have by far the most refugees/immigrants per capita, 
   top 10 by foreign-born poverty risk gap ratio compared to natives, 
  swedish is my mothetongue so i can speak of this . 
  most of them would want to do the same , or go further . 
  sorry for assuming things about czechia . 
  you were the only one better than sweden . 
  my other points still hold true though, 
  sweden has had a lenient refugee policy for a while . 
  with the balkan wars a lot of them were refugees to sweden . 
  so you can indeed blame the volume of refugees for this unflattering chart . 
  and you lie if you pretend the leave campaign wasnt quite racism fueled, 
  cool,
