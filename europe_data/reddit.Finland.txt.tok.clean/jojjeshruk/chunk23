  but you seem quite firm in your convictions so i suppose we 'll just have to agree to disagree , 
  this is , , , bulgaria ? 
  cheers , there is this funny counter circlejerk against sam harris at places like / r/badphilosophy where people make fun of dumb sam harris `` followers '' . 
  so you tend to generalize about you guys . 
  nice to see that some of his fans have some chill . 
  good comment m8 happy new year :d, 
  tbf to myself that was because i looked at his highest rated comments where he explains how islam is the problem, 
   regressive-leftest i might be , how do you define it ? 
  myself i do n't like to generalize people if i can avoid it, 
  you could have just said you like sam harris , woulda saved us both some time, 
  let 's see , your two top comments are  because muslim-majority societies have a strangle hold on the un and have destroyed its legitimacy ? 
  they vote as a block for the most despicable and backwards and always win . 
  and  if you can ban the klan costume and ban nazi flags , then you can sure as hell ban the burka . 
  tell me , what makes you hate greenwald so much . 
  you would n't by any chance be a fan of sam harris ? 
  really ? 
  the guy who broke the biggest story of the century is the same as a website that says the government is turning frogs gay ? 
  smh, 
  while the person you two are describing is true , that kind of person is very uncommon , especially on the left ( where i 'm from ) . 
  just because you are against increasing tensions between the west and russia does n't mean you somehow are a putin apologist . 
  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/1/30/1182442/-glenn-greenwald-responds-to-widespread-lies-about-him-on-cato-iraq-war-and-more here he writes about it himself here , he also mentions other misconceptions about his character . 
  he was a practicing lawyer at the time and simply trusted the media . 
  he did n't ever advocate for the war in any way . 
  saying that he was for the iraq war is quite misleading . 
   agreeing with tucker carlson of all people about russia being not all that bad citation needed , i watched that interview , it seems that people are angry simply because the anti-russian hysteric narrative is being questioned . 
  why do people here hate glenn greenwald so much ? 
  what bad things has he done since snowden ? 
  questioning the lack of presented evidence for the `` russian hack '' is hardly equitable to being pro-russian, 
  that 's what happens when you host a google critical documentary on a google owned site i suppose, 
  i dont realuy agree . 
  dn is the most credible newspaper in sweden , is it not ? 
  that 's why the means are controlled democratically you doofus , 
  it 's also real comvenient, 
  that 's the things tovarisch , you are making thigs waaaaay too simple . 
  my guesa is you didnt even really live through any communism, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/20hf1i/did_stalin_really_kill_millions_of_people_how_do/ here the top response is someone arguing that even including famines the number s isnt higher than 6 million . 
  the 30 million figure seems to be ungrounded, 
  sooo , only people with ballsand brains are on reddit ? 
  sorry m8 , but i dincerely doubt that, 
  trump got like 3 million votes less than hilary , trump only got something like 24 % of eligible votes . 
  also , communism has been widely vilified in various media . 
  people do n't like it for no reason, 
  you 're probably right , i just really dislike the saudis, 
  i do n't think eastern europe was included , so no big surprise, 
  yeah , these anecdotes here might not be useful for understanding communism and it 's impact on those countries, 
  shit if you have enough money you 'll get health care and an education in fucking somalia, 
  possibly implying that the ones who are pro communism are older people ? 
  that does n't matter , here 's a more interesting quote  reflecting back on the breakup of the soviet union that happened 22 years ago next week , residents in seven out of 11 countries that were part of the union are more likely to believe its collapse harmed their countries than benefited them 7/11 hmm, 
  opinion polls from eastern europe often show a relatively high amount who would like communism back , surprising to see so little of that positivity, 
  yeah it 's pretty crazy stuff , it gets lost since it was so close to ww1 . 
  but it pretty much seems like the syrian civil war today , but instead in russia, 
  in the distant future stalin will be seen like djinghis kahn . 
  not for his evil , but for what he accomplished , history is weird like that . 
  his crimes are vastly exaggerated by western society . 
  it 's not like he personally ordered 30 million innocents to be murdered so he could keep power . 
  he indirectly murdered countless of innocents , but not at the scale that we like to think . 
  your point still stands of course . 
   that 's great , and even though new government was n't as efficient as everyone hoped , let 's give it some time . 
  but no if the people have a revolution , partly because they are tired of the war , and the new government keep fighting the war , they are pretty much asking for another revolution . 
   most countries have good healthcare and education ** cough ** * america * ** cough **, 
   industrialisation there is nothing like totalitarian communism if you want to industrialize an agrarian society extremely quickly . 
  your inconsistencies cast doubt on everything you say, 
  most socialists would like the control of the means of production to be with the workers and not the `` state '' . 
  that 's why we saw the kronstadt rebellion and the mahkonists ( spelling ? ), 
  in ukraine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kronstadt_rebellion, 
  i live in finland , the land with the lowest corrpution index , sadly , we too have crony capitalism , unfourtunately there is no capitalism without some crony in the mix, 
  capitalism is the same system that forces bangladeshi girls to work 14 hours a day so that their little sister will have a chance to go to school . 
  our wealth and comfort is enabled by the suffering of others , such is life in global capitalism . 
  it is debatable if there are any reliable alternative systems , but capitalism sure as hell is n't `` fucking awesome '' for the vast majority involved in it . 
   as there will never be a situation where ** people want to all be the same let alone be entirely the same ** socialism is about the means of production being controlled by workers or the collective , not necessarily everyone having the exact same amount of money all the time . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gpfmp/polls_show_eastern_europeans_miss_communism/ many eastern europeans want communism back, 
  i thoroughly enjoyed reading this comment !, 
   the main reason eastern europe isnt as wealthy as western europe is because of the failed communist central planning policies of the ussr convenient, 
   not understanding the internal tribal dynamics and the loose mixture of religion , tribal loyalty and nationalism means a lot of times there is gross simplification can we all agree that saudi arabia are assholes here ? 
  it 's just a bit shitty writing m8 :d but the point is totally true , america is a very dysfunctional democracy atm , 40 % of 21st century elections have gone to the one with less votes , corruption tilts all policy towards the right and imperialism, 
  never seen these, 
  ooggaa boogga people inside these lines are the ones who are good people, 
  this is really confusing . 
  i go to school right in the building behind that stage , also i have no idea what this music is . 
  edit : i looked into it , very sad plane accident , cool music , thanks for posting op !, 
  implying nationalism isnt the most muh feels ideology, 
  fascinating . 
  well , it kinda is, 
  actually the sample size has been determined to be way too small to generate any reliable data . 
  this is basically a vanity project for the government to be perceived as innovative and benevolent while they implement all around austerity and centralize health care to a fewer number of cities, 
  nah we are too influenced by the racist empire sweden . 
  i doubt that your understanding of sweden 's position during the war is very comprehensive . 
  there was a book called `` finlands sak \u00e4r v\u00e5r '' ( the cause of finland is ours ) that sold 600,000 copies . 
  the campaign resulted in a force of around 100,00 volunteers that left to fight for finland against the soviets . 
  in addition the campaign provided economic aid , clothing assistance and medical personnel . 
  the campaign was financed by the swedish industry as well as trade unions . 
  the assistance was desperately needed , as we were both outnumbered in terms of economic , military and man power . 
  i , for one , am very thankful to the swedes that helped us in our time of greatest need . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're suggesting sweden should have done differently . 
  should i turn myself into the hague or will a shin beth team take me to israel eichman style ? 
   most people do n't think germany should carry the blame for the holocaust ( rightly so ) , why should sweden get props for something that happened at the same time and was mainly initiated by the danes in the first place ? 
  i think sweden deserves props for helping us in the winter war . 
  at the same time i do n't necessarily blame the current russian government for the crimes of the soviet union . 
  historical blame for a nation that has changed it 's system of government since then and credit for good historical deeds are not equivalent in my mind, 
  of course not .
