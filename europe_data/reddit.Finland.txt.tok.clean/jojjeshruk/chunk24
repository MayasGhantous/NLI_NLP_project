  as i said before your point was valid . 
  i do n't think i was trying to draw parallels , although i get that it seemed like it, 
  history matters . 
   i think its time to get over it , it happened almost 70 years ago and everyone involved are dead . 
  things you should n't say about the holacaust . 
  but yeah , thanks for the info , your point is valid . 
  however the investigation was shitty . 
  this is from bernadotte 's wiki page  it is alleged that a three-man ` center ' of lehi had approved the killing : yitzhak yezernitsky ( ** the future prime minister of israel yitzhak shamir ** ) , nathan friedmann ( also called natan yellin-mor ) and yisrael eldad ( also known as scheib ) although swedes had good reason to be outraged for a long time it is now history, 
  of course it holds relevance in historic relations . 
   especially when it 's left wing people who normally do n't even think you can take pride in your nation does the right have a monopoly on pride ? 
  you can feel proud over something your forefathers and relatives did without heavily subscribing to the ideology of nationalism . 
  as to your last statement , appearently it doesnt hold any relevance for israels right wing government . 
  while i 'm at it , did you know that in1948 the nephew of the swedish king was murdered by hardline zionists while trying to make peace in the area . 
  the swedes surely have n't forgotten avout that, 
  okay this makes sense thanks, 
  bevause you dont wan na look or act like assholes, 
  probably fellow proletarian student, 
  i 'm talking about a centuries old tradition in that sentence . 
  you know , if napoleon , germany , spain or france get too powerful britain intervenes to balance things out on the continent . 
   people have been saying that the uk 's trying to destroy the eu for decades . 
  it 's absolute rubbish repeated time and time again . 
  quite possibly , yes . 
  hmm , yeah . 
  they are a bunch of stoic fucks, 
  how to encourage western europe to recognize palestine with one simple step, 
  what you are missing is the moral power of sweden in northern europe . 
  you might not know this if your view of sweden is based on the internet , but they have actually had some significant soft power . 
  they are quite respected in northern europe and their model of a welfare state has shaped the region . 
  what they do matters inside the eu . 
  people like olof palme who condemned both the crushing of the prague spring as well as western imperialism has made sweden look like an honest broker . 
  sweden might not have good relations with israel , but historically they have had good relations with jewish communities , i 'm especially thinking of the jewish refugees that came to sweden when the rest of central and northern europe was under nazi control . 
  am i being an asshole or is that not something that should be deserving of respect ? 
  to me this looks like arrogant populism . 
  i mean this just makes me ( and every other leftist/liberal ) want to encourage our governments to recognize palestine . 
  tl ; dr i 'm un-ironically offended on the behalf of our western neighbours , and perhaps slightly too emotional about this, 
   why not try to damage/destroy the eu if you 're going to leave it . 
   the british support for eu expansion was always a game of divide and conquer really ? 
  i had n't ever even considered this . 
  seems absurd . 
  i mean i know it is british tradition but somehow i would have thought they were past that kind of stuff : / are there any good op-eds or something that theorize about this or some other source ? 
  with all due respect , but this idea is quite shocking , yet plausible . 
  british society is interesting . 
  it is perceived as very civilized and sensible . 
  it is one of ( if not the ? ), 
  oldest democracy , yet it is quite authoritarian and dysfunctional . 
  quite interesting, 
  why is terrorism worse when it 's a suicide bomber than if it is a military chopper , if the same amount of civilians die ? 
  i do n't think there is a difference  they want to split the country right ? 
  i do n't think this is per automatique a bad thing, 
  looking at current events and history , the kurds dont look like the bad guy , justmy perspective, 
  only its more extreme because they dont do it for the peomise of 72 virgins, 
  turkey has been killing kurds in air attacks . 
  perhaps there would n't be this terrorism if the turkish state was n't conducting terrorism against kurds, 
  all news have some bias, 
  cheers, 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  are there any good news sources in english to follow what happens in spain ? 
  preferably something liberal or leftist, 
  the british olympics were corrupted from the start .

  so the right wing government ca n't rob the poor completely , because if they do psoe will topple the government in a vote of confidence ? 
  seems like it will produce some reasonable policy, 
  one thing to keep in my mind is that cultural differences exist in what exactly it entails to `` have a negative opinion '' . 
  swedes may hate roma as much as the french , but differences in the culture of political correctness hinder them from expressing their racism . 
  as for israel . 
  sometimes being anti-jewish gets confused with being anti-semitic , this might also depend on the language . 
  with all this said , wtf greece ? 
  let them default . 
   thinks that catalonia is n't oppressed , despite being denied right to self determination  links a bunch of catalans acting angrily  so either the catalans are just spoiled brats ** or ** they are simply acting like a people that has suffered under centuries of spanish rule or , if you will , * oppression *  calls me an idiot , effectively losing the argument after resorting to filthy ad hominem, 
  this really does n't prove anything . 
  why not include a link with barcelona beating real madrid while you 're at it ? 
   or did you already run out of arguments ? 
  i 'm afraid that 's not an argument , ad hominem , i win, 
   self determination rights were designed to nations under colonial rule implying the relationship has n't pretty much been colonial . 
  but just tell yourself whatever makes you comfortable with oppressing catalonia, 
  of course a frenchie would say that . 
  how many minorities have n't been murdered in the name of france ? 
  you fail to mention how the constitution was created in a time of extreme political instability, 
  it 's a former imperial state with various minorities . 
  so the answer is yes, 
  sometimes the law is wrong . 
  sometimes the principle of self determination is more important, 
  i think most of us never think about him, 
  https://images.encyclopediadramatica.se/thumb/a/a6/murray_rothbard_on_children_and_rights.png/660px-murray_rothbard_on_children_and_rights.png murray rothbard , famous capitalist thinker, 
  i mean even trump was pro gay marriage before obama . 
  he could have claimed to be `` socially liberal '' had he chosen that path, 
  also known as center right . 
  the whole `` fiscal conservative , social liberal '' thing seems to exist to get poor people to vote against their interests . 
  problems is that within the eu the national parties have so little power that they actually ca n't truthfully promise too much change, 
  thanks for explaining , watching the results i was sure there would be a right wing coalition . 
  goes to show you should n't presume things about other nation 's politics . 
  i mean the fucking pirates having a prime minister ? 
  phenomenal stuff . 
  my interpretation of the results was that the collective right wing would have enough seats for a majority . 
  how come that is n't happening ? 
   just residual `` cosmetic '' racism like inconsiderate remarks being made and feelings being hurt , basically racial fender benders and mild cosmetic damage . 
  shit then our conceptions of racism are different . 
  i 'd suggest you keep an open mind tho . 
  because , you know , you might be wrong, 
  shit the jews still exist in europe , even tho hitler did a bit more than cosmetic racism .
