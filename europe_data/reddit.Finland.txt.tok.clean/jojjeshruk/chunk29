  perhaps yeah , im no expert . 
  listened to an episode of radio war nerd about the bosnian war , where they expressed this sentiment . 
  when american social democracies talk about socialism . 
  they think it means when government provides health care , wrong i know . 
  but the point is that political terms depend on the linguistic , social and political context . 
  i get it . 
  cant be easy being serb on the internet . 
  besides , croatians and bosniaks prolly would have cleansed as much as you if they had the means . 
  not saying your innocent or anything , but my impression is that croatians for example got bit of a free pass at the time of the war in western media , despite acting quite fascistic . 
  fair enough lol . 
  but you must admit that the people of balkan have quite a long history of killing each other . 
   well , we had socialism and not communism potato , potatoe . 
  in some ways you were more communist than the svoiets since workers had more control over their workplace than in the soviet republics . 
  those terms have many different definitions , in serbian maybe your terms are correct . 
  you 've been made head sarcasm knight of the usta\u0161e, 
  not at the moment, 
  from yugoslavia collapse 10 years forward , n'est pas ? 
   and cause property damage in the million this is actually good, 
  government is social property , at least in theory . 
  private property is theft, 
  yugoslavia wasnt too bad . 
  at least the balkan people werent killing each other when it existed, 
  cutting education to make finland great again . 
   the median for people working just to be clear the median was for people working full time , ergo people who are searching for a job and people who work 50 % ( who maybe actually want to work 100 % ) are not included . 
  this creates a `` median '' average salary that does not include all working groups  well you should find it very helpful as now there 's going to be less debt for you to pay when you start paying taxes . 
  instead i 'll have more personal student debt , hurray, 
   how could students earn salary if they do n't work ? 
  i 'm a student , i work like 8 hours a week to make ends meet without loans . 
  my salary is not included in the median wage . 
  also a lot of people , especially young people work part time , even without studying , seems a bit unfair to not account these people in the statistics . 
  children is maybe dumb to include lol , but you see my point , no ? 
   but nothing happens because our people are too leftist so the governemnt ca n't come up with reforms did n't stop them from lowering my student subsidy from like 330 to 240 or something . 
  that 's like a lowering of 25 % , gon na have to start eating even cheaper next autumn . 
  personally i dont really see how helpful that is lol . 
  http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_palkat_en.html median of average * full time employee * is 2 963 $ . 
  that is without counting half time employed people , unemployed , students , children etc. 
  so if you included all adults or all citizens the median would be far lower besides that is not the most important thing imo . 
  but rather this '' finnish economy has barely grown since 2007 , one of the most stagnant economies in eu outside of the pigs . 
  so it doesnt say much if confidence is highest in years '' finnish economy is still absolutely nowhere . 
  median is not average unfortunately . 
  finnish economy has barely grown since 2007 , one of the most stagnant economies in eu outside of the pigs . 
  so it doesnt say much if confidence is highest in years, 
   milorad dodik refuses to recognize srebrenica as a genocide so a regional leader in bosnia refuses to recognize the genocide his ethnic group commited 21 years ago ? 
  how does the country not fall apart from that ? 
  that 's not to exclude serbs as most factions acted violently when given the chance . 
  but just practically how can an aragement like this ever be stable ? 
  are balkanites afraid of conflict erupting again ? 
  yugoslavia was at least good at not having people kill each other while existing , bit of a rarity in balkan history, 
  that 's rich coming from the people who were so oppressive of poor eesti that you founded tallin , taani = danish , linna = castle , taani + linna = danish castle = tallin, 
  leave rojava alone , rrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeee, 
  did n't a lot of estonians fight for the red army ? 
  you want another boring ass lake/swan/forest instead ? 
  i actually think these coins were cool . 
  its important to know and remember the dark side of our history . 
  its not like excecutions were being celebrated, 
  yeah the outcome of the finnish civil war was ultimately decided by big power geo politics . 
  i.e the bolsheviks trying to get peace with the germans, 
  yes it is , pretty ugly to use that sort of term , its almost orwellian in some sense, 
  that 's a bullshit cop-out invented by revisionists and you know it, 
  sooo bill clinton throwing money at a government right before an election doesnt count as fraud ? 
  i said helped , no one can rig an election completely from the outside . 
  obviously most of the corruption wqs done by russians , but withe acceptance of america, 
  first of all , great comment , best one in the thread . 
  no good counter arguments are to be found below . 
   sabotage of the russian election in 1996 when clinton essentially bankrolled yeltsin when he was in the single digits with his approval this is so incredible i 'm shocked we dont talk about it more often . 
  if people knew what you are describing they would understand all current russian conflicts and events much better . 
  *** america helped rig the russian election of 1996 ***, 
   ` no true socialism ' i actually `` lap it up '' because according to the theory it is true . 
  however if you interrogate one of those libertarian asshole types about why capitalists are n't working you get the same excuse , `` it 's not true capitalism because the nosy government is destroying our health care market '' . 
  no but really you would have to lack a lot of fantasy to imagine that current global capitalism and `` soviet union planned economy and social democracy at the barrel of a gun '' were the only option . 
  what a meaningless comment, 
  and you are ruled by the most radical party in europe . 
  is tsipras even trying , or is he just in impossible circumstances . 
  it might be possible that greece could use some anarchy, 
  eu and imf targets dont measure success if you starve people to reach it, 
  i think camus perhaps created this image of the french man a bit . 
  he was bit of a fashion ( and hotness ) icon, 
  same with hitler and his war lol ? 
  well maybe ita stupid always i dunno, 
  `` finland '' didnt say anytging the finance minister said something . 
  ticks all the boxes for an attack on a real progressive leftist from a `` liberal '' newspaper . 
  `` pro-putin '' `` nationalist '' `` chavez '' `` doesnt love the eu '' . 
  it 's either reform or die for the eu . 
  if macron and similar face less technocrats keep in power this ship will steer into cliffs, 
  spanish civil war 2 : the gang goes to france, 
  i have a joke for you , ** cough ** anarcho capitalism, 
   there is no way to hand that over to the workers except by breaking up the company - which would be pointless . 
  google mondragon , a successful cooperative, 
   we must make sure the rich have obscene wealth so they can keep creating jobs in the watch and champagne sector . 
  middle-lower class people spend all their money and thus create much more jobs than the rich, 
  you cant make that much money without directly or indirectly exploiting another humans labour . 
  i believe all exploitation is unjust . 
  if a company is earning millions the workers shoud get their fair share . 
  the founder could still have his 300k and live as good as possible  people will either find loopholes or change residence to another country thats true but it doesnt have to be . 
  if our rulers want tax cheating can be stopped, 
   but no one knows how to solve it or knows a better system so well yea . 
  if only there was some alternative economic system where the means of production were controlled by someone else, 
  so both sides are wrong ? 
  are you a genius ? 
  so we agree that no one * needs * it ?
