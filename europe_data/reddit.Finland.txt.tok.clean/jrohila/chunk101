  the point in here is that things need to be really fucked up if an ex-soviet satellite state grows much faster than a state that has had market economy for much longer time , have had functioning democracy since 1974 , have been ec member since 1986 ... you know , things need to be fucked up , if all these advantages do n't give you much better economic results than a country that for 50 years was under the iron curtain . 
  there is difference ? 
  ... hmm ... 
  lets make a simple test ... how many multinational publicly traded corporations there were in yugoslavia ? 
  ... local stock exchange is enough , no need to be listed in nyse ... oh damn , i forgot , they were communists , no stock exchange , no multinational corporations . 
  with that logic there was nothing wrong in spain before crisis ... * no sir , it was all good , the economy was founded on solid foundations . 
  yes sir , more concrete was used in spain than in the rest of europe , it literally guarantees state finances . 
  * yeah . 
  not to mention that there is huge pension bomb brewing ... 
  is it really the fault of austerity that portugal has lower gdp nominal per capita than slovenia , a mother fucking ex-communist country ? 
  maybe , just maybe , things were already badly fucked for decades and nobody did nothing , except throw all the eu money into garbage bin decade after decade . 
  russia during putin has been keen to spread its sphere of influence around the old soviet republics and ex-soviet satellites . 
  while russian influence in bulgaria and romania to date has been scarce , fear of resurgent russia has largely been driving force for both western and eastern states to drive up countries to join the union . 
  you see , european union is not an economic union , it is a political and strategic union . 
  it has always been a strategic union since inception of european coal and steel union . 
  while it is n't per se against anybody particularly , it is seen as an assurance against external interference be it economical , political , or even usage of military force . 
  geopolitics . 
  it was better to absorb both bulgaria and romania into eu and start a slow assimilation process of making them western countries than to let them slip under the russian influence . 
  the same is true with both serbia and ukraine . 
  you do have to export something if you want to import something else . 
  for example oil and gas are commodities that european countries need to buy from open markets with hard currency . 
  actually one of the reasons why eastern european communist states collapsed was that ussr would n't delivery anymore oil and gas to them under market prices , which lead to collapse of both eastern industries and states . 
  some countries are worse than others , but in the case of many troubled european countries it works like this : * crash the economy with bad policies * complain that it is the fault of rest of the world * do nothing to address the real causes of crashed economy, 
  cap should be shut down completely , it is useless . 
  instead of cap we should create a framework to address food security . 
  in essence we should pay minimum subsidies to farmers to secure ability to produce food in a crisis situation . 
  for example up here in the north it is n't very efficient to farm , but we really ca n't afford to just truest in a crisis situation we could buy food from world markets , or bring it from other eu countries . 
  it is not whatever . 
  the language you use tell a lot about you . 
  for example your careless use of the word bitch could easily make one to think that you could be misogynist , or sovinist , or just typical example of southern macho culture . 
  you really do n't want to cause that impression . 
  your title ... ** silvio berlusconi 's bitches ** ... 
  the title of the article is silvio berlusconi 's women ... the degrading part is using the word ** bitch ** . 
  the link itself is fine , but this submit is degrading , thus down vote . 
  doing tax returns is so last season . 
  in finland the tax agency collects information via multiple sources , including banks , pension funds , etc. . and then calculates your taxes including your deductions , fills out your tax form , sends it to you , and if you are satisfied to it , as usually is the case , you do n't have to do anything . 
  does that really matter ? 
  i do n't interact with the state at all . 
  the only thing that they send me is pre filled tax form that usually quickly goes to garbage bin as there is nothing to correct . 
  you only need to fill govermeant forms if you are unemployed or need social benefits , and for these people usually have enough motivation to translate them . 
  how does public sector bi-bilingualism enable easier movement of labor ? 
  after all it is the private sector that creates jobs . 
   a ) eu gets a single language you ca n't force private enterprises to use state designated language . 
  if you do so you will force a huge big cost to the private sector which surely will cause a big political rebellion . 
  in my honest opinion the eu should leave the private sector alone , there is no benefit gained from state intervention . 
  why do i have a feeling that you have newer ever had a gun nor are able to operate one . 
  you might want to take a turn and crawl back where you came from . 
  you do understand it was your kind of spinless people who let the nazis take over . 
  a civilized society needs to draw a line and say , do n't go over this or you will be severely punished . 
  failing to do so will only escalate problems until the society falls apart . 
  meth addicts already know this , they were n't born like that , they made a bad decision in their life and they get to carry consequences of it . 
  also if they want to be free from meth they need to do turn in their life to make it possible , they need to make decision to do so and follow it . 
  and yes , it is that simple , i know people who have been addicts , and their road to recovery started from their decision to stop using drugs . 
  i 'm sorry , but you do n't make any one favours by denying free will and personal responsibility , actually your kind of attitude is what is spoiling our societies . 
  when you deny personal responsibility you are either enabling individuals to live like someone else or the at whole society owns them something , or worst than that , you take the little activity out of them and let them just pass their lives without taking part on it . 
  everybody has a free will and personal responsibility . 
  if you have received bad cards to your life from the start , then you just have to deal with them . 
  if you want to turn your life around , then it is you who has to make it happen , not anybody else and not the society for certain . 
  in civilized societies hospitals are n't stormed . 
  how about you keep little more better care of your society . 
  how does 250,000 people who ca n't get job because they do n't have employable skills connect to 70 people making a poor decision to storm a hospital ? 
  at the end of day , you are individual and you select between right and wrong , and if you choose wrong , you deserve to be punished . 
  you loose your right to live when you endanger lives and well-being of others , then you are legitimate target to be subdued . 
  would you have preferred if one of the staff members or police officers would have lost their lives ? 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  yes it is when the crowd has just destroyed one ambulance and four police cars . 
  excuse me , but where do you draw the line and say that this is enough ? 
  maybe let the crowd burn the hospital , right ? 
  you have problem with few low life 's loosing their life ? 
  and it is better idea to have a group of 60 to 70 men vandalize hospital and threaten staff ? 
  you also do understand that shooting targets in short range with for example glock is very accurate business . 
  the bad thing about european police is that they do n't shoot to kill . 
  in this case they should have just shoot on the group hopefully taking few down and teaching a valuable lesson to the rest : act civilized or die .

  in finland we have a system called family day care where a caretaker takes care of maximum four children in her own home . 
  the compensation for this is approx . 
  1200 $ month , do note that median income is approx . 
  many people prefer family day care and actually in case of small children , less 1 year old , it is usually the only available form of day care . 
  in here the problem is that the state has legislated that there needs to be daycare place for everyone between 3-7 , which is unfortunate because many would prefer to go back to work much earlier . 
   lets just say , the concept of a transfer system is very good when you find yourself being the one needing help . 
  the concerns you pointed out are also important in that the transfer system should never be the permanent solution ( ie . 
  certain countries always receiving money forever ) , but instead just a ** buffer to help you get out of trouble ** while keeping the market confidence because `` clearly , this country will not be allowed to go under as they are being supported by the rest of them '' i get the sense from your comment that you do n't really see that there are great underlying problems in economies and societies of troubled countries like greece , portugal , spain , italy and ireland . 
  if that really would be the case , then having a buffer fund would be a really good thing , but in case where there are really big problems , then there is no buffer big enough to fix the situation because fixing the problems are all about political will to do reforms . 
  for example ... * ... there is increased global competition in industry sectors that were before mainly serviced by spanish and italian firms , that are now in intense pressure from chinese companies . 
  * ... oil and gas cost more and more and in the future they will cost even more , this will greatly affect countries like italy and greece who do n't have neither own fossil fuel production or non-fossil fuel based energy generation , hydro dams and nuclear plants . 
  * ... fertility rates in all of troubled countries are too low , varying from 1.33 to 1.46 , meaning that there will be less workers in the future to take care of the elderly in such a quantity that the current pension system will explode if reforms are n't done to decrease current and future pensions while increasing current and future pension contributions . 
  * ... there is too much corruption and not enough business friendliness and that was just a few things . 
  the thing is that markets will always get these things , and if somebody disagrees with them , they will speculate until that somebody looses . 
  in this case the people who disagree with the reality are politicians and those who have voted them in , they have a distorted view of reality . 
  we are in a crossroad , but not in the crossroad you mentioned . 
  in my opinion people need to decide on do they want to live in a country with strong market economy and capitalism as guiding force of society , or do they want something else . 
  if people do n't want or accept capitalism and market based economy , then they have to get used to a idea that they will be much poorer and their country will be less developed than those with free market economy . 
  this is the real crossroad . 
  if people want to keep their bloated and inefficient states , then that is their choice , but they have to understand that they ca n't make others pay for it . 
  then again , the fastest way to pure capitalism is communism . 
  and then the poor countries will be even more poorer . 
  mission accomplished . 
  how about the poor countries just work harder , develope infrastructure , entice foreign and internal investors , create business friendly enviroment , invest on education , etc. . . for the next 20-40 years , because that was what rich and developed countries did , and what countries like china , indonesia , taiwan , south-korea , etc. . . are doing . 
  only if the poor countries allow rich countries to get their share of corporate and income taxes enabled by moving of production from rich countries to poorer .
