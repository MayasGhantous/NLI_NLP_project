  any negativity is swiftly put down . 
  the eu needs to answer its critics not just drown them out and claim they are `` evil '' eurosceptics . 
    the eu increasingly feels like a autocratic farce . 
  time is money and every second counts . 
  it is better to hash something out and then execute it and then look on what the situation is and what needs to be done next . 
  there is no place for grand plans as there is not enough visibility in the markets to allow this . 
  for example the problems that greece has had have only become bigger as more time has passed , much due to there being more visibility to highlight them . 
   i wish i believed that . 
  i 'm a huge support of free markets but the eu seems to be heading in entirely the wrong direction . 
  france wants income taxes at 75 % , protectionism is discussed especially with regards to china . 
  a socialist presidential candidate in france wants income taxes at 75 % , that is totally different thing than a socialist president executing that election promise . 
  also the eu is n't becoming more protectionist , what it is doing is starting to use its force to open foreign markets that are much more closed from foreign entities than the european single market . 
  like i said before , this is about image , what image greece has . 
  the problem for greece is that they have an history of irrational decision making by the state and politicians elected by the people . 
  thus we ca n't just deny the possibility that the greek state and politicians would again make irrational decisions . 
  and again youths burning buildings in athens does n't help . 
  thus it is natural to ask could the worst case scenario become true ? 
  you do understand people have lots of money at stake in here , and when you have money on the line , you tend to be at least little paranoid . 
  and in case of cuts , the problem with cuts were that they were n't as drastic enough and not soon enough , thus we have arrived to this situation . 
  if there would n't have been cuts or they would have been lower , the transformation of the economy would still be further behind that it is . 
  the transformation that greece is undergoing is closest to what ex-communist countries under went after the fall of the iron curtain . 
   i 'm very confused by how you think this was supposed to work . 
  ever since the euro came in to being the markets have demonstrated their belief that germany would be the lender of last resort . 
  this was hardly a secret and one of the reasons how greece and others were able to borrow at rates significantly below what they previously had . 
  markets assuming that germany is the lender of last resort is fairly new post-recession idea to explain why markets acted like they did . 
  however this neglect the fact that german economy was weak at the time euro was launched and remained so for a period time , also other economies in the peripheral countries grew at much faster pace and their state finances were in order . 
  in greece of course they were n't as markets were given false information by the greek state . 
   by `` nobody '' are you restricting the criteria to rabid europhiles ? 
  i do recall many eurosceptics and even moderate europhiles warning of the dangers of the various treaties that were enacted throughout the late 80s and 90s . 
  however , contrary views do not go down well . 
  the only danger that were talked at least in here was euroarea countries having different economic cycles that could cause tremendous pressure to our economy if we would be caught in recession while other countries would n't . 
  the remedy that was suggested then was to have a buffer fund for the rainy day , that was transformed to state actively decreasing state debt . 
   even now there is little debate about how europe can emerge from this crisis any stronger . 
  it 's mostly being dealt with technocratic governments being imposed and back room deals . 
  hardly the beacon of enlightenment and democracy many people hoped for . 
  markets will find the balance eventually and the growth will return , that is the answer on how europe will emerge from the recession . 
  and in case of technocratic governments , they are legitimate as they have been democratically elected , parliamentary democracy does n't require ministers to be elected politicians , they only require parliamentary oversight and control . 
  one of the underlying presumptions of the euro system was that states would n't act against their own long term interests at least not for periods long enough to make any sizeable impact . 
  even if they would , markets would guide them back to sustainable path . 
  that is why there were no lender of last resort , and no formal process of state going bankrupt . 
  nobody anywhere imagined a situation like the one in greece were succeeding governments and state institutions would collude together to falsify state finances a year after a year . 
  now obviously this assumption was false , even democratic states can risk the longevity of the state itself . 
  the only problem is that in order to fix that , there needs to strong oversight and control over member states , and that is something that member states have n't wanted until now when there is nothing else to do . 
  marshall plan did n't really help germany , approx . 
  70 % of their industrial infrastructure was almost intact after the war . 
  what hampered the rebounding of the german economy was allied policy of deliberately hindering german economic recovery . 
  after allies changed their policies , the german economy rebounded and created the economic miracle in west germany . 
  i would also like to point out that marshall funds were really not needed for the economic recovery . 
  finland did n't receive any funds , but instead had to pay up reparations to the soviet union , nevertheless economy grew rapidly with simultaneous industrialization and urbanization of the country . 
  i would also add that all talk about reparations is just bad attitude that hinders more economic recovery , you can either have an can-do attitude or you can have ca n't - do attitude , the choice is yours . 
  the difference between portugal/ireland and greece is that there are violent riots and hate speech in athens , but not in countries mentioned before . 
  what this essentially causes is not only the markets , but the general public to question the longevity of the greek state . 
  can they really handle the situation ? 
  can they be trusted ? 
  will they leave the eurozone ? 
  will they leave the eu ? 
  will they have a communist revolution ? 
  is civil war out of the question or not ? 
  some may protest that image spread through mass media should n't have this kind effect , that we should have more truest and only rely on fundamental facts from statistics , and so on . 
  however dublin nor lisbon are burning , that is also fact . 
  and that facts makes it much more easier to truest that these countries will deal with the issues , as they seem to have gotten it . 
  greece on the other hand seems to live still in a bubble . 
  12 points to italy ( nina zilli ) , such a lovely lady with a lovely song . 
  10 points to montenegro ( rambo amadeus ) , but i seriously doubt that it will win the contest - must have a good stage to make impression ... 8 points to san marino ( valentina monetta ) , feel good dance song, 
  most research in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics is actually well paid , especially if it is directly related to industries . 
  the reason why people are doing research is that it suites them better as an working environment or personal strengths at the moment , than working for a corporation . 
  many people that i know actually hop between the corporate and academic world . 
  in case of other research , the fact of the matter is that it is n't as important as the stem fields . 
  for example research of ancient languages do n't contribute to general production , they are pure overhead costs , thus they do n't warrant for good salaries . 
  greece , spain , portugal and ireland have been net recipient of european union funds since their admission to the union . 
  in ireland and spain that money was spend more wisely and now ireland is net contributor and spain probably will be in the next budgetary period . 
  can it then really be said that the union has n't addressed structural imbalances ? 
  should n't the better question be why greece and portugal have n't achieved better results as spain and ireland have ? 
  [ budget of the european union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_budget ), 
  you did n't really answer the question by saying that we should have a sensible limit . 
  what is a sensible limit ? 
  the problem is that eurozone has various amount of different countries with different industries with different social policies with different demographics , etc. . . that must be taken into account . 
  for example ... * italy has birthrate of 1.38 child per women , while in ireland its 1.96 , meaning in italy there will be less workers producing wealth in the future while having more pensioners consuming it , in ireland the situation is different . 
  should n't this be factored too in to calculations ? 
  * germany has a wide variety of different key industries , small countries such as finland have fewer key industries and these industries are much more reliant of the success of few key corporations , for example due to nokia having difficulties on competing on smart phone market , there has been a sizeable plummet in finnish exports and tax revenue . 
  if nokia would be a german company , the german state would have hardly noticed the change . 
  should this be calculated too , how dependent countries are of list of corporations , and in how volatile markets they operate ? 
  these are just few of the bigger examples what kind of things must be taken notice and factored into the analysis of what is sensible and what is not . 
  even if we would take even more measures to our analysis tool , it still would lack information , it still would be too rigid . 
  the only way to determine how much money and with what rates can be loaned for a country in a certain time is via markets . 
  but let say we make this tool , we still have the problem that in some situation the tool will just say no : no more money . 
  maybe because the state went over the line , maybe because it did n't follow up its restructuring program , maybe something else . 
  in the end there is no more money . 
  what people have to accept is that states can and will go bankrupt ; state official do n't have job security , they can be fired at will ; citizens do n't have unlimited benefits , they will end when money ends . 
  in my honest opinion , this is the things that people have to accept , that money can run out and that they have to take responsibility of it . 
  what ever mechanism we have , people are n't free from the consequences of their actions . 
  edit : spelling , spelling , spelling . 
  there is equality of opportunity , not equality of results . 
  and what would be the mechanism then to keep countries from loaning more and more money from the ecb ? 
  the reason why countries have to loan from the markets and not from the ecb is that the markets make their independent assessment of risk involved with different countries and different timespan , this assessment then is priced to interests rates . 
  but please , tell what would be the alternative mechanism to ration the limit on how much money countries can loan from the ecb . 
  seems more like a communist group ...  the only alternative to the social devastation currently enveloping the continent is the ** mobilisation of the working class ** all over europe against the trade union bureaucracy and its hangers-on , and the formation of workers governments . 
  such governments would immediately repudiate the austerity and debt repayment programs dictated by the banks , withdraw from the eu and all of its institutions and begin the process of constructing a genuinely democratic alternative based on satisfying the needs of the broad masses of the population , ** the united socialist states of europe ** . 
  these call to arms would be much more intelligently interesting if instead of 19-century rhetoric they would give an clear answer on how europe would have higher standard of living after their revolution/reform , and how europe would succeed better in global competition with us , china , india , etc. . . 
  but of course that is much harder thing to do than to just call people to take arms .
