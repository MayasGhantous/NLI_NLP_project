  i do hope that the irish will join the treaty as it seems that they will become the best if not only example if the positive outcome of the fund , namely to say that they will make it and turn their economy up and be able to return to international bond markets . 
  china during its history has break up many times to smaller pieces only to be reunited again . 
  rome did n't fell to barbarian invaders , it dissolved itself , and the barbarian themselves had adopted much from romans and some had assimilated to it completely . 
  actually there was mutual recognition and even admiration between the romans and the german tribes . 
  the same ca n't be said with the relationship of rome and constantinople , there was schism between east and west and it only grew larger as time past on . 
  in the west there is the same connection as in the east , you can see the holy roman empire as the reunited roman empire . 
  well , the holy roman empire existed from 962 to 1806 , its culture was a mix of roman and germanic , legal system inherited parts of the roman law evolving in the end to medieval roman law , the rulers considered themselves to be emperors of the roman empire and referred to themselves as such . 
  now of course the holy roman empire was n't roman , but it brings up the question on when something stops being something and starts being something else . 
  rome itself inherited and adopted much from greece , but also from etruscan , however we do n't consider romans to be greek or etruscan , romans are romans . 
  you have to cut a line somewhere . 
  the culture was greek , the language spoken was greek , the byzantine empire was very much a greek state . 
  there was no europe before the fall of roman empire and birth of the carolingian empire . 
  before that there was rome and there was greece and the greek east . 
  thus from this point greece was n't a european state nor actually was rome , rome was proto-european . 
  byzantine empire was n't an european state , it was n't even a successor state of rome , it was greek state , and it was very much an eastern civilization , not western . 
  in the west , foundation of current europe was laid on top of the roman-germanic heritage and culture that gave eventually rise to the birth of europe , the carolingian dynasty . 
  after the foundation of the carolingian dynasty , europe has transformed wave after wave from renaissance and enlightenment to modernity . 
  these ideas of europe have spread and extended europe from west to east everywhere where rulers and population have adopted them . 
  in some places the adoption process has been unfinished , the biggest example of these being russia that still is and considers to be an euroasian state , not an european state . 
  in some other places like the balkans the adaptation process is on-going , and in some places like caucasus it is close to non-existent . 
  now some may find it offensive that some countries and cultures are n't seen european even if they are located in the geographic area defined as europe . 
  but that is the case and it does n't go away from denying it . 
  there is visible difference in scenery and attitudes when you for example compare central europe to places like caucasus that you ca n't deny that the two are completely different things . 
  increasing the reserve requirement of the banks will only lead to banks decreasing their lending and restricting their loan policies , which will only suppress the economy . 
  i would also like to point out that in your case the amount necessary to keep in reserve would lead to severe restriction with loan policies . 
  essentially it would take time back 20-30 years when the only people who could get loans were the ones who could back their loan with extant assets . 
  that would lead to increase of inequality among citizens as even well earning people without financial backing from their family or relatives could n't get loans for housing or starting businesses . 
  i would also like to point out that printing money is taxing people who hold money . 
  most rich or well to do people do n't actually have cash , but have invested it to inflation safe investments like housing and stocks . 
  the people who are most hurt of inflation are the middle and lower classes who are n't protected from the inflation and whose wages and living standards are being suppressed by always increasing prices . 
  worse than that , high inflation will make upwards social mobility practically impossible as people ca n't save money for future investments like housing or starting a business as inflation eats up their money . 
  the best way for state to fund its activities is throe taxation with tax code that has the least amount of deductions as possible . 
  this way people know how much they are paying and who is doing the paying . 
  in my honest opinion paying up state finances with printing money is cowardly as politicians are then taxing the population without them largely knowing about it . 
  if taxes need to be increased so be it , if taxes ca n't be increased , then state expenses must be cut , the key thing is to be open on what is happening and how much different things cost . 
  to my knowledge most eurozone central banks are part of the state itself , for example the bank of finland operates as an detached department of the state . 
  the reason for this is that in most european countries the state has always been and seen as central actor in the economy , while in anglo-saxon countries like uk and us this has n't been so much the case . 
  i do hope that they wo n't just concentrate on business lobbies , but also show how ngos are lobbying too . 
  well , farage is a good speaker , in another life he would have been a good stand-up comedian . 
  that is a default . 
  i have to say i disagree . 
  i too was sceptical at first about the document , but watched it through and i found it rather good . 
  the thing that you have to keep in mind is that most people actually do already know what has happened in greece , on why they are in crisis , but most people do n't have more concrete image and feeling on how things are in greece . 
  i think that this documentary was more about exploration of greece than trying to give you some lesson or a bout loud of information about the subject . 
  for example i was shocked about the children . 
  they do n't have free school lunch there , even though they have a bloated public sector !? 
  that is a whole new level of bad . 
  but i was also frustrated that the woman who was being interviewed did n't even suggest this , instead they tried to do many other things that seemed to be more inefficient and expensive than offering just a simple meal . 
  the great thing about a simple meal for a big number of people is that the more people you have , the cheaper it is to make the food per student . 
  i also noted that many people in greece were ready admit that things have to change , for example the woman that shouted about fakeli , or for example the australian shopkeeper who said that people are now asking for recipes . 
  for me at least these few things alongside with few others high lined that a change is possible , that there is indeed a transformation happening , that there is hope that the country will save itself in the end . 
  in a representative democracy it is the duty of the parliament to do what they think is best for the country even if that goes against popular opinion . 
  the people can voice their opinion when the next election comes . 
  i would also like to point out that angry rioters or peaceful demonstrators only voice their opinion , they are n't the voice of the people , just part of it . 
  if rioters threaten the functioning and stability of the democratically elected government , it is the duty of the government to defend the democratic system even with usage of violence and even declare martial law if needed . 
  i hope that rioters in greece understand that if they go over a certain line , there is nobody in europe that will judge greece government if and when it does what it has to retain the law and order in the society . 
  rule of the mob is n't allowed and wo n't be tolerated . 
  usually only eat lunch at work , for example in this week ... * monday : indian buffet ( fast food ) * tuesday : chinese buffet ( fast food ) * wednesday : uruguan chorizo sausace and corn-potato cake ( latin restaurant ) * wednesday evening : pizza made in wood oven ( american-italian restaurant ) * thursday : vanilja salt flavoured fried pike-perch ( latin restaurant ) ... and probably in the next days ... * friday : grilled tofu and vegetable quinoa ( latin restaurant ) * saturday : hopefully something made of fish ( by myself ) * sunday : light hamburger ( ordinary restaurant ) i would also like to point out that for example the current finnish cuisine is quite young , our so called traditional finnish foods are just few hundred year old . 
  however as we have more ingredients than our ancestors , practical cuisine from lunch places to restaurants to home kitchens has become more global . 
  spain seems to be going to the right track , hopefully they keep up with the reforms . 
  can you enlighten me on why do you think that returning to drachma would be beneficial for greeks ? 
  from my point of view returning to drachma would be suicidal . 
  the new drachma would n't be worth anything for the next few months or half a year , after that it would probably in time reach 50 % of the value of euro that nomura has forecast . 
  thus ... * all prices of imports would increase by 50 % including oil and gas . 
  would the average greeks afford this ? 
  * how returning to drachma would make greece more competitive ? 
  how would the export sectors of the economy hire more people ? 
  how could the export companies handle transition to the drachma ? 
  and least but not last , why would return to drachma be any easier than having an internal devaluation ? 
  at the end of the day the fact is that greeks ca n't afford their current public sector , either they cut it or all settle for lower standards of living . 
  * does anybody in greece ask this question ? 
  which is better to have , large public sector or higher standard of living ? 
  and no , you ca n't make example of nordic countries , nordic economies work because our public sectors are constantly being restructured and reformed to make them more efficient , usually with adding of market based elements and more flexible labor usage . 
  * actually what do you think would happen if greece would return to drachma , again how could you compete in the global economy ? 
  i 'm sorry that i have phrased my questions so badly , but i 'm genuinely interested to hear on what the thinking in there is ? 
  that is not sims , that is [ habbo hotel ] ( http://www.habbo.com ) !, 
  it seems that what they have essentially done is created a habbo clone for all teens and young adults that interested on politics to hang out , chat , make friends and politics . 
  well ... 1 . 
  does n't matter . 
  oil and gas that run economies cost more with less valuable currency . 
  also many german companies produce products and services that ca n't be replaced , they will be bought at almost whatever price . 
  secondly german companies are global , they reorganize their production chains , in essence relocate parts of their manufacturing to places with lower human costs , like their eastern neighbours . 
  low yielding debt does n't obligate countries to borrow more money , that is purely political decision in a state level and a business decision on bank level . 
  if states , banks , companies and individuals have made bad decision then there are consequences including bankruptcy and lower standards of living at least for a while . 
  in my honest opinion the problem in southern countries is that people are holding back on changes and thus necessary changes are n't being made to the economy . 
  for example in spain what would be needed is us kind of personal bankruptcy laws that would allow indebted persons to go bankrupt and then allow them to rebuild their lives from a clean table . 
  yes , many banks could go bankrupt , but if people ca n't reboot their lives , then the whole economy will suffer greatly before things get better . 
  not to mention that state bureaucracy in a place like greece should be wiped out completely , if the people do n't want to or ca n't pay for their state services , then the state should offer only bare minimum amount of services that people are willing to pay . 
  again this would cause great deal of pain for people working for the state , but then again , they would employ themselves sooner or later by people buying their services directly from them . 
  again law like the us personal bankruptcy is needed , also what is needed is removal of many labour restrictions and allowing free at will hiring of people . 
  again , great pains , but it would allow people and companies to try , hire somebody , if it works , great , if not then that is too bad , but at least it was tried . 
  ** less fortunate ** was the thing that caught my eye . 
  the southern economies are n't less fortunate , they are less competitive in the global economy , too rigid and inflexible , and too dependant on few key sectors of their economies , that is why they are in trouble right now . 
  germany could also be in trouble , but what germany did in the beginning of 00s were reforms to their economy that allowed their economy and companies to function and compete better in the global market . 
  i would also like to point out that the success of germany is not due to euro , it is not due to its southern neighbours fairing less well , it is providing the market was the market wants . 
  in the case of germany that is exporting tools and machinery to developing world like the bric countries . 
  in case of southern countries , like for example italy , their traditional industries like textile and clothing had time to prepare to globalization of trade and competition , but they did n't act and invest , and neither did the italian government . 
  and if we go to redistribution of resources between different areas , that is n't possible if there is n't any common policy including labour and social legislation , any common rules on government spending etc. . . and the last thing that caught my eye ... ** olive belt ** ... you know , have you thought that this might be an problem ? 
  olives were a big hit before , but now they are a commodity , what needs to happen is that dependence to olives are cut down and instead industries and services established to replace them . 
  actually not , while the generation in question does n't literally disappear , and will eventually work things out , they will miss many opportunities .
