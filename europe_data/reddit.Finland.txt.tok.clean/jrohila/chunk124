  for example in finland there is huge generational cap in the construction industry , almost a whole generation is missing that was supposed to enter work life in the beginning of 90s but did n't because of our major depression . 
  and while many did find work in other industries , there quite a number of people who became permanently drop-outs from the society . 
  however , what many forget when talking about a lost generation forget that this is more or less manufactured problem caused by frigid and inflexible job markets . 
  in countries were the job market is free to act , people from all generations share the burden of unemployment , but in countries were jobs are heavily protected and laying of people is punished severely , earlier generations retain their employment , but younger generations wo n't even get their first chance . 
  in all of these countries , what the government should do is to the labour market , this would allow companies to fire their inefficient and unsuitable workers and either more competent or younger people to replace them . 
  while the total unemployment would n't go down instantly because of it , it would allow sharing of burden cross all generations . 
  and of course in time due to companies and the whole economy having greater efficiency due to better allocation of human resources , the economy would rebound and grow much faster than it would without the structural changes . 
  just send it to all of them . 
  i myself did just that with a different matter . 
  wrote a formal but brief email and sent it to all of them . 
  most of them replied , some even mentioned their own position in the matter . 
  i think this is the best tactic as if enough of us do that , then it should get the attention of the meps that this is an important matter and that they should take a note of it . 
  you need more electricity / energy in the north and than in the central europe due to the cold and long winter . 
  thus while kwh price in the northern countries are lower than for example in germany , thanks to energy market liberalization , people also have to use more energy , thus have to use more money . 
  they are basically the finnish conservative party , thus firmly more right than center-right . 
  however for a long time the party has been essentially a liberal-conservative party - they are more in favor of personal freedom and responsibility than other parties . 
  the reason why they are little vague about who they are is maybe because it is n't that clear for them too . 
  for example the last maybe 8 years they have declared to be a working peoples party , that they progress and advance society where people can and do work . 
  in the past they were more associated on being party of the well-to-do and entrepreneurs , but since the disappearance of the ussr and finland becoming more or less classless society , they have become more liberal , more representing people who think that people should take more personal responsibility about their lives . 
  of course there are differing opinions . 
  i myself am a long time voter of the national coalition party , so you can take my opinion with a grain of salt ;-) edit ... pro-eu , but so is the green party and their presidential candidate pekka haavisto . 
  this is actually a general reply to your conversation with specofdust ... why finland is n't in nato ... ** nato ... ** * what is nato ? 
  is it an organization whose mission is the defence of its members , or is it an organization in search of mission ? 
  * nato is more or less lead and united by the us , if the us goes into a war that is strictly not defensive , do we have to give our support for them to make sure their support for us in the future , namely * `` if you are not with us , you are against us '' * . 
  ** russia ... ** * russia is far more worried about china and its strategic situation in siberia than it is about the west . 
  there is zero chance of the west dreaming about having more lebensraum . 
  the reason why russian leaderships acts aggressively against the west is because they have nothing to fear about doing so . 
  * many rich russians have bought property from finland , they like to keep finland being finland , otherwise there is no use for this place for them . 
  there is also loads of economic integration happening , much to do with opening of the fast train connection and soon to be finished motorway between helsinki and st. petersburg . 
  * russia is not soviet union . 
  ** eu ... ** * finland has n't been neutral since its admission to the eu . 
  this has been the opinion of the political leadership since the admission , and as years have gone by , this view has strengthened and been lately starting to gain acceptance from the russians too - russians woke up around the georgian war / lisbon treaty that there is this european union entity . 
  * eu since the lisbon treaty has internal security clauses . 
  for example sweden has already noted that this and said that during a crisis it would help any eu country in trouble . 
  * eu will build its own military organization in the next decade or two . 
  it is only a matter of time and need . 
  already there are infrastructure projects like galileo that will be used by all european armed forces for their navigational needs , yes , it is meant officially for civilian use , but can and will be used by military . 
  i myself in the 90s would have liked finland to join nato , but nowadays i would prefer not to join it , but rather have an eu defence organization . 
  actually this eu organization could be the european part of the nato , i would have nothing against it , but it would need to be an equal partner in the nato with the usa . 
  nothing special ... 
  the most important thing happening in 2012 in finland will be the restructuring and downsizing of municipalities from 336 to approx 100 or less . 
  the aim of this is to decrease administrative costs and streamline municipal organizations making them more responsive , capable and more efficient . 
  however to achieve this the current cabinet formed by conservatives and social democrats have to fight a hard battle against centre-right party and against populist party . 
  europe and the market do n't play that large role in this , this is purely internal matter of organisation , but of course the ruling cabinet will use worsening global economic situation as an reason to drive up support for this reformation . 
  in my honest opinion , it is about time to cut the bloated municipal administrative side and concentrate local decision making . 
  privatization is much better if provided with regulation that prevents formation of monopolies and opens up natural monopolies to competition . 
  many of the currently unemployed were employed in the construction industry doing manual work . 
  now as the boom has gone by , these people do n't have no work , and as so many were employed in the construction industry , it will take lots of time for the economy to absorb these peoples doing other kind of work , usually more or less manual work . 
  and the jobs that you mentioned , well , you ca n't become a programmer over a night , and actually most people wo n't become programmers if even given education , they just are n't cut that way . 
  the other jobs also require right kind of education and usually work experience . 
  why do they hate our freedom ? 
  so , what is wrong with [ el escorial ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_escorial ) ? 
  and also what do you mean should be done to [ valley of the fallen ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_cruz_del_valle_de_los_ca%c3%addos ) ? 
  from my point of view they are just pieces of history , reminders of what was before ... 
  i just found [ this ... ] ( http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=4832 ), 
  i do n't think that the eu itself has any court , but there is the european court of human rights that is not part of the eu , it is part of council of europe . 
  however as being member of the council of europe is requirement on being member of eu , member states more or less have both legal and moral obligation to follow the ruling of the echr . 
  i really do hope that this case is brought to the echr . 
  the student in question did wrong , but the americans have no jurisdiction over him , this should be purely british / european issue . 
  hungary is obligated to join the eurozone by its accession treaty , anything that obstructs it from fulfilling this treaty obligation can and will be judged as an breach of their accession treaty . 
  i think that the main reason for why the eu commission is so worried about the independence of the central bank of hungary is because the country is being bailed out by the imf and the eu . 
  another reason can also be that hungary has an obligation to join the eurosystem , thus the hungarian central bank will be part of the eurosystem one day , and having not independent central bank , it seems , runs maybe against the ecb/eurozone rules . 
  so in short , this does n't affect britain at all . 
   but to recognize this leads to the question of what europe is , a question that neither merkel nor sarkozy nor barroso are willing to ponder because they seem to have little memory of the christian roots of europe . 
  jerusalem , athens , and rome are seen as contemporary sources of security and fiscal problems , not as symbols of a great civilizational and religious inheritance that truly unites europe . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  the writer clearly does n't have any idea on what makes europe and europeans - certainly not christian roots . 
  christian roots where more or less cut of during the era of enlightenment and the following french revolution and industrialization and modernization of societies that gave rise to nationalism , capitalism and socialism . 
  this is the rich background that makes us europeans . 
  ** first ... ** transaction tax would only raise the level on where hft is profitable . 
  my guess is that for a short term it would decrease the amount of trading done , but in longer term it would bound back with more clever algorithms and more processing power ... of course if the transaction tax would be set too high , it would just end all trading inside the eurozone , but this is n't what we want . 
  the aim of transaction tax should be to collect money in time that would then be used during a financial crisis to bailout troubled banks or hedge funds in order to limit the damage to world economy . 
  ** second ... ** why should there be an end to unlimited rehypothecation ? 
  if britain wants to give more freedom to their banks and financial institutions than the us or the eurozone give , then should n't it be up to them to decide on do they want to continue on giving this freedom or not ? 
  of course if britain would join the eurozone , then there should be some common ground with rules , but as that is n't going to happen soon , i would let the british decide by themselves on what is best for them . 
  major problem on making a comparison between a euro country and a non-euro country is that even the non-euro countries have benefited from the euro . 
  euro has lowered transaction costs , but it also have stabilized exchange rates with non-eurozone countries who have highly interlinked economies with the eurozone ... [ case in point , look at the long smooth line with euro ... ] ( http://goo.gl/vmi2m ) however if jump back to finland and sweden , i would say that there is a good probability that euro has had an beneficial impact for finland . 
  why is that ? 
  it is because sweden has different industrial structure , they have more smes that are more international , and they have much larger financial sector with much larger capital base . 
  the finnish economy , while being much more international than it was before , it is still largely dominated by few sectors and big multinational corporations . 
  with finland entering the euro , there has been two major changes , stabilisation of markets with ultra low interest rates , and a big flush of international capital and connections to startups and smes ... 
  this however is just my humble opinion . 
  usually better for developed countries ... [ list of countries by gdp ( nominal ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) and by [ gdp ( nominal ) per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) and to answer your question , uk gdp nominal and per capita are higher than that of italy , which of course is not a surprise . 
  sorry to nit pick , but a proper way to measure the economic output of a country is to use gdp nominal figures , not ppp which is more suited on measuring how much purchasing power an individual has . 
  [ the difference between gdp nominal and gdp ppp : a rule of thumb ] ( http://applebutterdreams.wordpress.com/the-difference-between-gdp-nominal-and-gdp-ppp/ ),

  ever closer union with more economic freedom, 
  actually i do believe it , and let me open up for you on why i believe so . 
  even if we would n't have had euro there would have been number of things that would stayed the same even if there would have been no euro . 
  for example lets look at the situation in gips countries , do note that not everything applies to everywhere ... ** extra-european circumstances . 
  ** * both japan and the usa would have flooded global markets with cheap money offered by their respective central banks . 
  * rise of the chinese manufacturing would have eroded competitiveness of traditional southern european industries . 
  * increasing oil , gas and commodity prices would have hurt southern economies more than northern , which are more energy efficient . 
  ** cultures , values and beliefs of societies . 
  ** * countries would still have had divisional politics , largely thanks to the haunting memories of their not so distant dictatorships . 
  * there would exist strong mistrust against state leading to the same kind of corruption and mishandling of public money as we have seen so far . 
  * markets would n't be anymore free as they are now , simply because a ) public sector is too large and powerful ; and b ) there is no trust or understanding in the general populations / political class that free market economy is the best way to manage the functioning of the economy . 
  so what would have happened ... gips countries would have experienced strong real estate boom fueled by having both local banks and companies cheap usd or yen denominated loans from the markets , and by having flood of foreign direct investments to their real estate markets . 
  this would have largely masked eroding of traditional industries and allowed states with their added surplus increase their expenditure .
