  they are really badly underestimating commitment of american people to freedom and democracy , especially of their allies . 
  not to mention wrath of german people for any gross human rights violation , not to mention usage of nuclear weapons . 
  this reminds me of robert fisk 's interview with osama bin ladin who thought after the unsuccessful somalian operation that the usa was a paper tiger , that the american public could n't handle a war with him . 
  well , we know what happened , first afghanistan , then iraq and over decade of occupation followed by setting up and arming of puppet governments . 
  i would somebody in the russian security apparatus would be enough smart to get it that the war with the west is not winnable for russia . 
  if russia would attack any nato country i do n't see that peace would be possible either without occupation of russia or the russian people overthrowing their government and hanging the elite on the red square . 
   israel does have the means to do so : they just need to take away the little leverage hamas has over gaza strip civilians : charity . 
  give the palestinians real support , give them water , electricity , food , and work - and they will not feel like the only way they could survive is to trust hamas - or iran . 
  give the palestinians something to lose , because if they got nothing to lose , they only will grow more dangerous . 
  water and electricity are already provided by israel . 
  in case of work , palestinians have previously worked more in israel , they have a good reputation as being good construction workers and builders . 
  the problem however is that due to high number of suicide bombers in the 2000s , israel just ca n't let people freely flow over the border . 
   give the palestinians something to lose , because if they got nothing to lose , they only will grow more dangerous . 
  have you asked do the palestinians any more have a say in this ? 
  hamas is executing left and right people that object against them . 
  gaza is not a democracy . 
   instead , they choose to send in the idf , killing hundreds of people without getting closer to shut down hamas , thus perpetuating this conflict for the next fifty years . 
  what else to do ? 
  the thing is that it is cheaper to launch a rocket towards israel from gaza than for israelis to destroy that rocket with their iron dome . 
  if israel would have done nothing , then sooner or later they would n't have had any more interceptor missiles to destroy rockets fired by hamas . 
  then those rockets would have exploded everywhere in israel causing death and destruction . 
   edit : back-of-an-envelope peace plan . 
  specifics obviously have to be ironed out . 
  if you ask me , the best way to achieve peace is for israel is to just send a note to hamas that gaza is now an independent region and israel has nothign to do with them . 
  provision of water and electricity will either be cut down or being billed by the market rate at the end of 5 or 10 year transformation period . 
  when the population has to actually start to think about how they will pay for their water usage or where they will get electricity and work , then they start to concentrate on something tangible and not supporting a lost cause . 
  being very bad at implementing what they want is n't an excuse to give a blind eye to hamas . 
  what hamas wants is to genocide jews or at least ethnical clense them from areas constituting the old british mandate of palestine . 
  after achieving this they would set up an authoritarian/theocratic islamist state . 
  another thing to note when speaking about hamas is that they are not for peace . 
  when they talk that they want israel to lift the blockade , etc. . . they are only offering a cease fire for the next 10 years . 
  they are not offering permanent peace . 
  their objective is to rearm and destroy israel what ever the cost is . 
  just think about that . 
  israel would lift the blockaged . 
  at that moment arms from all supporters of hamas would freely flow to them . 
  they would arm themselves , maybe even arm islamic militants in egypt . 
  then think about the possibility that iranians would smuggle nuclear arms to gaza and modern short distance missiles . 
  only few well placed missiles to the metropolitan area of tel-aviv and half of the israeli population would be dead . 
  it is easy to critice israel , but do the israeli critics offers any way for israel to make a permanent peace with hamas ? 
  they already withdraw from gaza . 
  what should israel do ? 
  and do n't talk about palestinians as a whole . 
  gaza is gaza and hamas is hamas . 
  really ? 
  a politician with spine would say that hamas must be subdued and its financiers and arms suppliers brought into a court of law to face punishment for assisting a terrorist organization . 
  the thing that people continously forget that this is n't a conflict between israel and palestinians , this is a conflict between israel and hamas . 
  if for example mrs. farsi would live in palestine , she as a woman would have no rights almost at all . 
  at best she could decide what kind of veil she would use to cover her head . 
   revisionist powers like russia , china , and iran appear ready to confront the global economic and political order that the us and the west built after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  but now one of these revisionists powers -- russia -- is pushing ahead aggressively to recreate a near-empire and a sphere of influence . 
  the difference with the three mentioned is that china is does n't see russia or iran as equals . 
  they see usa as something that they will sooner or later be equals with . 
  russia and iran on the other hand are to china what saudi arabia is to usa . 
  renting was unattractive even before hollande . 
  there are too much legislation protecting tenants and too less protecting landlords . 
  if the french want to have more rental apartments , then they need to relax laws involving renting to a point where private money will flow into new construction . 
  gsm standard specifies that mobile devices must be able to be turned on by the network . 
  turned on in this case means that the phone operating system ( not the user operating system like android , windows phone , or ios ) will turn on and core functions like microphone can be started , however you do n't see any sign of this happening as the rest of your phone keeps itself shutdown . 
  there are many ways how the state/public can own the water . 
  in my opinion water management should be done via state/city/public owned enterprise that operates independently and self sufficiently . 
  that means that the price of water connection and delivered water are high enough to maintain and develop water resources and infrastructure . 
  another point should be that as an independent , but state/city/public owned enterprise , the company should aim at being as efficient as possible , thus people working for it would n't be treated as public workers but as private workers that can be let go or outsourced if needed . 
  the big danger when public sector owns resource management function like the water company is that they mismanage it so that either infrastructure takes hit ; prices are too low thus needing subsidization ; or it becomes very inefficient by maintaining workers and management that it does n't need . 
  well finland is n't a very nationalistic society , but when i look around and see and hear what friends and other people are talking i get the sense that we as nation are proud that we have ** nice society that works ** and we ** take care of people ** . 
  all nations and cultures have their own way to work , they do , and thus i think that people want to see end results of that , to be proud of something . 
  so in short , no , i disagree with you , i do n't see we aere moving towards post-nationalism , nations and cultures have n't dissappeared anywhere , they are still different ( note to [ hofstede dimensions ] ( http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html ) ) . 
  i think that people do n't want to question the official party line of kremlin because the alternative would be even worser - that they are living in an authoritarian country whose leadership and security structures are guilty of waging aggressive war against other slavic people . 
  the reason why i am saying this is that recently i read an article about ukrainian and russian strawberry pickers in finland . 
  they got along greatly and had decided not to talk about politics when they are all around , to keep peace ... 
  however when the journalist asked/discussed from one of the young russian pickers , a woman from st. petersburgh , her opionion , she first defended really strongly putin , but then noted that her relatives in kiev are totally against putin and russia , and then had a moment of doubt , and asked with tears `` what if we are wrong about this '' ... luckily the other women in the group saw this and went to comfort her . 
  of course this is just one example ... 
  but i have had for many years the nagging feeling that russians are lost , they need to have something that they are proud of , as do all nations . 
  boosting energy efficiency is good if it really happens , it is bad if it euphemism for moving production to far east . 
  in the eu process intensive industries are already running tight due to energy costs , any additional costs will just result them moving production outside the union . 
  overall i think that instead of just focusing on energy efficiency , we should also concentrate on building new carbon-free energy production , for example nuclear and/or hydro power . 
  no , this is the fallout of out multiculturalism in europe . 
  this is what happens when we do n't have melting pot society where immigrants are melted to the surrounding society , but are either left as they are or even encouraged to keep their culture and values as they were . 
  ** first thing to remember is that we are all europeans ** , or french/german/finnish etc. . . ( please eurosceptics , this has nothing to do with the eu ) . 
  what that means is that we have one society were we are equals and were nobody is discriminating against any other . 
  this is something that we ca n't compromise about and we must vigilantly protect . 
  in the case of cafe in question , the authorities should make an example and not only contemn this act , but also punish with heavy fines the cafe owner . 
  ** second thing to remember this is europe , not middle-east ** , what ever problems there are in middle-east they are not european problems . 
  if people choose to come and live here , or come as tourists , they should leave what ever quarrels they have into their respected home countries . 
  not import them to europe !, 
  ** thirdly not all jews are israeli and not all israeli are jews , and not all israelis like what the state does ** . 
  in short if you or anybody else has a problem with the israeli state , they should go out and for example demonstrate against it , but in any circumstance they should not make this a people problem and they should not take grievances against individuals , that is racism to do so . 
   yes , but we have low birth rates . 
  we need more labour . 
  1 generation usually do n't fit in very well , but 2 . 
  generation fits in much better . 
  in many european countries the reason for low birth rates is economical , not enough money to have more than one child . 
  i would rather ask first is there anything that society can do to help its citizens to have more babies before taking people from outside to enjoy our social benefits . 
  in case of immigrants that are from the 2 & 3 generations , there are huge problems with them integrating and assimilating to european societies , from france and germany to sweden . 
  how long time must past until they have naturalized on being europeans ? 
   and yes , we 're rich and hightech countries . 
  we have it so good in our countries , that it 's out duty to help out where it 's not so good . 
  if that involves taking in some refugees , fine by me . 
  taking some refugees is good , we should help out , but not in the level that for example sweden does . 
  the thing is that there are only small amount of countries in the world that are developed and industrious , that progress the humankind onwards , that can afford to educate , take science to next level and try to solve global problems .
