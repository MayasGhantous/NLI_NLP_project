  the point is to break the administrative ability of the rebels . 
  with a limited strike on this building that did n't even destroy it , they can make the rebel administrative personnel to be afraid on going to work and thus by shutting down parts of the rebel administration , the ukrainian state is closer on cracking down the separatists . 
  it is easier to grow when your gdp per capita nominal takes a tremendous hit . 
  in 2013 gdp per capita nominal in uk was 39,567 usd trailing behind for example france 42,999 . 
  i can understand uk having more common with the us , nz , australia and canada , but india ... 
  please ... 
  lets get real , they are completely different culture , the only thing you have common with them is few hundred years of history . 
  i could believe that if there were n't so many people saying that uk can manage just fine by relying to the anglosphere ... which includes india also accordingly to these peoples . 
  when did uk become a socialist state ? 
  no epp !, 
  no wonder your economy is not going so strong . 
  there are many other things you have to take into account ... * increased overhead costs due to having more employees : working clothes , other equipment , management costs , hr costs , it-systems costs , education and training costs etc. . * availability of work force ? 
  in case of high knowhow fields , there are n't enough people to work even now , more would be needed but there is nothing that you can do to the gauss distribution of iq . 
  in case of low knowhow low value fields there is again huge need for employees already . 
  high-know and low-know fields are the fastest growing fields . 
  where there is available work force is in the medium-know segment , but that is segment is being automatized and fast . 
  i myself work in it , currently managing a team of my own in a large bank . 
  we are now on the verge of rolling in few big projects that will automate huge parts of the loan and finance handing jobs in the bank where i work for . 
  approx 70-80 % of the work force will be made redundant . 
  those who will be left will be the high-knowhow types that are hard to recruit and hard time to replace with automation . 
  reducing working hours only increases automation . 
  the problem when talking about defense spending is that in case of europe increasing spending with current nation state orientated structure does n't really bring that much more capabilities and abilities on-line . 
  however if the european countries would form under a eu , a unified european military and increase their defense spending to 2 % level , the american government would become scared because the new european army could possibly challenge and match the american military might and that is something that every us administration is outlined not to be allowed to happen . 
  the americans should be really careful on what they wish for . 
  if european states will boost defense spending , they will do together with increased european co-operation that eventually will lead into common european military that will be much more independent than current armies of europe , thus giving us decision makers less opportunities to get willing allies to their far flung adventures . 
  somebody should tell the dear congressman to go fuck himself . 
  if we are going to have a trade war lets bankcrupt texas first . 
  you have an armed thug that you capture , if he/she is a chechen or russian you kill them , if they have ukrainian identification papers or claim to be ukrainian then you imprison them until they can be prosecuted , or when they have been found not to be ukrainian , dump their bodies to land pit . 
  the thing why this crisis has continued and continued is because people who are terrorizing the east are given a free reign . 
  if instead they would be put to pay price on their actions , their fighting spirit would soon collapse . 
  for example the people who have claimed donetsk people republics house the 11th story office building in donetsk , why not hit it with a full array of missiles ? 
  destroy it in a single aerial attack . 
  you kill a good amount of rebels and set an example on what is to come for all the other rebels . 
  they should adapt a policy that they execute everyone that is not ukrainian . 
  if they capture a russian or a chechen , they should torture them to death and then dumb the body as warning to their comrades in arms . 
  actually if they capture a rt journalist , they should do the same thing to them . 
   their aim , as professed by the fighters themselves , is to destroy the state of ukraine and absorb most , if not all , of it into russia . 
  `` write this down : there is no such thing as ukraine , '' says mozhaev , who goes by the nickname babay , or bogeyman . 
  `` there are only the russian borderlands , and the fact they became known as ukraine after the [ bolshevik ] revolution , well , we intend to correct that mistake . '' this does n't surprise me at all . 
  instead of appreciating and sharing the richness of eastern slavic languages and cultures , they insist that there is only one language and one culture , and that is the russian language and culture . 
  what a sad state of affair , but then again , it seems perfect continuation on how things where before ...  the ukrainian language traces its origins to the old east slavic of the early medieval state of kievan rus ' . 
  from 1804 until the russian revolution , ** the ukrainian language was banned from schools in the russian empire , of which eastern ukraine was a part at the time ** . 
  it has always maintained a sufficient base ** in western ukraine , where the language was never banned , in its folklore songs , itinerant musicians , and prominent authors ** . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_language ) what i ca n't understand is why it is so hard for these russians to admit that there is ukrainian language and culture ? 
  why do they want to destroy an entire language and culture that spans from the original source as russian language and culture itself ? 
  you do know that it is the other way around ? 
  eurosceptics are getting pretty desperate . 
  the euro and eurozone survived the eurocrisis , not to mention that due to first the crisis in georgia and now the current crisis in ukraine , euro and the eu are rightfully seen as an political and national security issues ... to quote polish fm sikorski ...  `` the events in ukraine should prompt us to integrate with the eurozone as soon as possible , ''  the euro zone is based on the principle `` one for all , all for one '' , since `` serious threats to one state automatically imply changes for all of the member countries '' . 
   `` in the present complicated international situation , it is in our best interests to create such an interconnection between poland and other european countries , '' the game is over for eurosceptics , their chance came and went . 
  now they are so desperate that they co-operated with putin in crimea and ukraine . 
  for example marine le pen national front supports putin \u00b4 s intervention in ukraine ... 
  either eurosceptics are just useful idiots for putin and other enemies of europe and free world , or they are traitors . 
  what ever the case is , they are the fifth column . 
  eurosceptics , funded by your friendly guy in kremlin . 
  people should n't hold grudges , but ... 
  i have n't still seen atonement from eastern european countries to their participation to crimes against humanity , nor has there been any talk on compensations or return of lost property , be it german or jewish victims . 
  let me quote an example about yugoslavia and ethnic germans ...  ** fate of the danube-schwabians after autumn 1944 **  in the autumn of 1944 , before the invasion of the red army and the takeover of power by the partisans , the civilians danube-schwabian population either escaped or were evacuated from sirmia and slavonia ( more than 90 % ) , from the batschka and the baranja-triangle ( about half ) , and from the western banat ( only about 15 % ) . 
   `` the 5th of october was a warm , sunny autumn day , as we experienced it on the plain of the old homeland . 
  the fields displayed their gorgeous autumn colours , the cornfields showing their ripe , golden cobs and dry leaves , and in the vineyards the grapes were ripening on the vines . 
  the streets of franztal ( franz valley ) were teeming with terrified and desperate people . 
  among them school children with irritated faces in front of the school building , which refused to admit them . 
  one neighbor was hurrying to the other , seeking advice , which he could n't give him , because he was at a loss himself . 
  the thought of having to leave home and to head towards the country roads , without possessions and destination , was so unthinkable that one was led to believe that a bad dream had befallen the people . 
  but in the harshness of reality time was running short . 
  the church bell incessantly tolled the hours , mercilessly reminding everybody that the time of parting was drawing nearer and nearer . ''  except for the 90,000 soldiers , there were at least 195,000 danube-schwabians in their native lands at the time of the communist takeover , and they were dispossessed and deprived of their rights through the decisions of the avnoj . 
  in the banat , in the batschka and in sirmia more than 7,000 civilians had been murdered by local communist groups , the state police ( ozna ) , and partisan commando units during the `` bloody autumn of 1944 '' in the course of the operation intelligenzija . 
   the majority of the remaining 170,000 danube-schwabian civilians were imprisoned in numerous labours and -- in total -- eight concentration camps , which had been built for old , aged and sick people as well as for children under 14 years of age and mothers with little children . 
  the concentration camps soon turned out to be extermination camps . 
  in the batschka , there were camps at jarek ( backi jarak ) , totaling 7,000 deaths , gakowa ( gakovo ) , totaling 8,500 deaths , and kruschiwl ( krusevlje ) , totaling 3,000 -- 3,500 deaths . 
   `` at five o\u2019clock in the morning we were all rounded up . 
  at the camp and also during our work the warders and the guards heavily beat us . 
  i was beaten three times ; one time so badly i could not sit down for a month . 
  the partisan who hit me used a stick for it . '' ( report from the extermination camp gakowa )  in the banat , there were the camps molidorf ( molin ) , totalling 3,000 deaths , and rudolfsgnad ( knicanin ) , totaling 11,000 deaths ; in sirmia the camp seidenfabrik ( silk factory ) in syrmisch mitrowitz ( sremska mitrovica ) , totaling 2,000 deaths . 
  in slavonia , there were the camps walpach ( valpovo ) , totaling 1,000 -- 2,000 deaths , and kerndia ( krndija ) , totaling 500 -- 1,500 deaths . 
   `` the sick and the dying were lying on the ground on a thin layer of straw , like everywhere else in the camp , close together , only separated by loosely set bricks . 
  between the sick people stood and lay dirty bowls , broken dishes with disgusting leftovers , pots serving as cuspidors , unclean chamber pots , dry slices of inedible corn bread , filthy rags , and similar things . 
  amidst all this misery , there were the dying , in dirty clothes , in filthy rags , in their own faeces . 
  smells and odors were almost unbearable . 
  here , the final tragedy of our people took place . 
  i never saw my people as miserable and beaten as here , and at the same time never so proud and brave . '' ( report from the extermination camp rudolfsgnad ) . 
   in total , 50,000 of the imprisoned danube-schwabians had perished through hunger , epidemics and shootings in the labour and concentration camps within three years . 
  about 35,000 had succeeded in escaping from the camps , at the risk of their own lives , across the near borders to hungary and romania . 
   from 1946 on , thousands of orphaned children were transferred from the camps to children 's homes and had to undergo radical slavisation . 
  additionally , around the turn of the year 1944/45 , more than 8,000 women between 18 and 35 years of age and more than 4,000 men between 16 and 45 years of age were deported from the batschka and the banat to the ussr to do forced labour . 
  2,000 of them had perished miserably by 1949 . 
   the genocide of the danube-schwabians resulted in more than 60,000 civilian victims . 
  in 1948 , the camps were dissolved . 
  the approx . 
  80,000 survivors of the genocide had to accept three-year labour contracts and were only able to buy themselves out of these , depositing a high `` ransom '' , in the 50s , and then could leave for germany or austria ; usually destitute . 
   ** gorges and karst caves in slovenia **  the chairman of the first slovenian government after 1945 , boris kidri\u00e8 , publicly announced at the town square in maribor : `` the remainders of ` germanness ' in the northern territories have to disappear . 
  it is unbearable that these remainders still go for walks on slovenian and yugoslavian soil . 
  those people , who have sucked the sweat off our nation , those people , who have helped to enslave our nation , are no longer allowed to stay here . 
  it can not be that in our kolkhoz there are still people who once lived off the diligence and sweat of our winegrowers and exploited them . ''  the majority of the german lower-styrians and gottscheers were only allowed to flee from the approaching front after the 6 may 1945 , which resulted in a part of the german civilian population being helplessly exposed to tito-partisan terror . 
  atrocious mass executions had , for example , occurred in bachern/pohorje , where more than 2,000 german civilians had been killed . 
  a similar tragedy took place in the gottscheer hornwald ( gottschee horn forest ) . 
   according to estimates , more than 6,000 civilian germans fell victim to outbreaks of violence and the communist execution units of the ozna on slovenian territory . 
  after the english occupation force had closed the borders to carinthia and styria for german refugees , labour and concentration camps were erected for the germans , among which the camps in sterntal ( strnisce ) and t\u00fcchern ( teharje ) with 7,000 deaths were most notorious . 
  `` part of the refugees were loaded onto lorries , and it was those who were killed at t\u00fcchern . 
  the majority , however , were murdered right away , or rather at the gottscheer hornwald . 
   t\u00fcchern was horrible .
