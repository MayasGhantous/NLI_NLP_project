   the 44-year-old said that until march her family paid 58 euros ( $ 73 ) a month in rent out of her husband 's 500-euro unemployment benefit . 
  in april , her bank statement shows , her new landlords suddenly took 436 euros from her bank account . 
  the rent that they paid was n't enough even to cover the maintenance of the house . 
  while for them as individuals , it is a sad thing that their rent goes up , getting rid of rent controls is a healthy market correction that will in the end lead to better resource allocation and hopefully to building up of more rental properties . 
   to lure foreign investors , madrid overhauled rental laws , making it easier for landlords to evict non-paying tenants . 
  it worked : investment in spanish real estate increased 12-fold last year to 5.2 billion euros . 
  which it seems is already producing results . 
  in the finnish glorious socialist health care system , the child gets first identification number and designated name from the state . 
  the name can be changed later on , however for the system the person will always be known as ddmmyy-cccc . 
  ** pro ** this will make sure that criminals will be thrown to prison and citizens will be safe . 
  if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to worry about . 
  ** contra ** if you are a criminal or you have something to hide , then this legislation will make sure you ca n't anymore touch children in your holiday to south with impunity !, 
  * essentially , only criminals and pedophiles are against the european arrest warrant . 
   yes , we have . 
  thank you multiculturalism . 
  this case is about criminal negligence of officials to do their job . 
  what this case tells to me that punishments for officials for failing to do their jobs are too low . 
  the officials who covered the rotherham case should be prosecuted and they should be sent to prison for several years and they should be made personally responsible for any damage claims coming out from the child abuse victims . 
  zero tolerance policies should be used not only against criminals , but also with government officials . 
  either they do their job or they face dismissal and criminal charges . 
   do you think it is going to be beneficial in general ? 
  yes , very beneficial . 
  it will strengthen both european and american economies . 
   or is it going to a tread for the sovereignty of european people ? 
  at any time in any member state , people have freedom to elect an anti-everything party and get out of all treaties . 
   do we have to worry just reading what have been already leaked ? 
  we should definitely should not be reading what has been leaked , because a ) how can we know that it is a real leak ? 
  b ) will it be in the final treaty ? 
  and c ) how does fit the whole context ? 
  if you are a concerned citizen , what you should do is to contact your mps and tell them what are your concerns `` i do n't want to eat gm food '' , `` i do n't want labor legislation weakened '' , etc. . . so that when the final treaty is ready , those mps have an opinion about what is important with their electorates and to which parts they should put their emphasis . 
   what is the coverage of the demonstrations , if any , in your country ? 
  no demonstrations , go to work . 
   are there a huge movement in your country ? 
  the only huge movement in the eu is those people who go to work everyday and do n't have time to worry or demonstrate against something that does n't even exist yet . 
  was he added to the schengen ii system as persona non grata ? 
   i have a question for you : all member states , as we know , approved of the current calculation methods . 
  more important however , and this is surrounded by mystery : did all member states authorize the eu to go back to as far as 1995 when calculating this rebate ? 
  because you are acting all high and mighty as if everything has been agreed upon . 
  i would think so . 
  when eu does something , it usually does it very throughly with a huge paper trail . 
  now you might ask the reason why for example britain gave its permission to do so . 
  the answer might be that the british government thought that the other eu states had stated their data worser than they had thus britain would be receiving money back , or they thought that the figures would not go much in either way , which they did n't when you take into account the whole context . 
   that , is not sure at this point , so to be honest : cameron might even be right . 
  of course , it is stupid and premature to say that the uk will not pay ( as it might turn out that the uk indeed could have seen this coming and did agree to it ) . 
  discarding all the other statements cameron made in relation to the eu , he might actually be ( legally ) right here though . 
  first of all the sums are not big , they are small or tiny . 
  second of all , if all member states agreed to recalculation , then that should be upheld . 
  not to mention that where some states have to now pay more , some member states already paid more for the beginning . 
  it would be quite unfair to backtrack now . 
   also , to get rid of the misconception : the eu did n't bring peace . 
  the ecsc and moreover , the eec , did that . 
  let us not paint a too romantic picture of the eu because of ideology . 
  i agree with the rest of your comment . 
  eu is the ecsc , they just expanded their area of business and made re-branding couple of times . 
  if you scratch enough , under the surface you will find the good old european coal and steel union . 
  when was the last time a leader of france went to brussels and said `` i want my money back '' ? 
  think it about this way . 
  for some countries to underpay their membership fees , other countries overpaid their share . 
  for example finland has overpaid 184 million to the eu . 
  while that sum is small , in relative terms it is the same sum of money that the uk is going to pay to the eu . 
  however in our state finances , 184 million is just a tiny amount of money in grand scheme of things . 
  then again , if we had not overpaid our share , maybe we could have 36 km to 61km more motorways in this country . 
  no , it is the other way around . 
  i am afraid that the child does n't get a fair chance to achieve their true potential . 
  that said , i am not against home schooling , but it can only work when with setting minimum requirements on what a child needs to learn and monitoring that the child also learn what needs to be learned . 
   edit : also you know damn well that there are plenty of teachers , schools and countries , which do n't give a proper education . 
  in finland , this is the list of subjects that need to be teach to child * mother tongue and literature * the second national language * foreign languages ( at least one ) * environmental studies ( environmental and natural sciences ) * health information * religion or ethics * history * social studies * mathematics * physics * chemistry * biology * geography * sports * music * visual arts * handicraft * home economics and they all have degree levels what a child needs to learn . 
  while there are properly people who can actually teach all of these to their child , i seriously doubt your average-joes ability to teach all of these subject properly to their child . 
  in 2013 the total uk expenditure was # 720 billion , with deficit of # 108 billion . 
  # 1.6 bn is a small sum of money especially as it comes from several years of underpaying membership fees . 
  and the # 1.6 bn or british payments in general to the eu budget do n't have nothing to do with anti-eu sentiment . 
  the anti-eu sentiment comes from a deeply different world view and understanding of how world works and should work . 
  i would say that i am more worried in case of this crisis on it possibly creating an bad example of `` lets not follow common rules that we together agreed '' . 
  that will cost to eu more in time . 
  having britain leave the union is smaller price to pay than bargaining about rules . 
  it is a right of a child to get a proper education to enable them to become fully functioning citizens of the society . 
   i know that they 've refused to pay fines resultant from them ignoring eu competition law in order to benefit their domestic businesses when it comes to things like contracts , and nothing was ever done about it . 
  then could very well name a case or cases if there are any . 
   i do agree that going to the uk and telling it to shell out # 1.6 billion within a month is ridiculous and disrespectful . 
  if it 's truly the case that the uk treasury was given so little forewarning , then cameron is right to be pissed . 
  it is the same situation with every eu country whose payments are reassessed . 
  and # 1.6 billion is a very small sum of money in a budget of big and developed economy of the uk . 
   edit : and even if they want to do everything at germany they would have to import the workers because germany has a 5 % of unemployment . 
  there is no guarantee that these project would be even done by european companies . 
  as all these investments would go out via public tender , it could very well be a chinease companies that would win and build them using their own imported labor . 
  and lets say that even if some of them did went to spain , do you really think that it would solve anything ? 
  infrastructure projects need just handle amount of workers compared to building housing . 
  how will germany investing into infrastructure projects help spain at all ? 
   last time this happened we had an inefficient toll gate mechanism all over europe . 
  not only did nationalisation of the road network make it more efficient , it was much cheaper and the quality improved . 
  prior to this the private companies had no incentive to actually improve the quality of the roads . 
  you had to travel over their land . 
  they had an unshakable monopoly . 
  there are toll roads all over europe . 
  just cross the channel and go to france and you have toll roads . 
  in italy * 61 % of the autostrade are handled by the `` autostrade per l'italia s.p.a. '' company , and its subsidiaries . 
  all of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by anas . 
  the network of motorways covers most of italy : northern and central italy are well covered , the south and sicily are scarcely covered , sardinia is not covered at all . 
  * in case of quality of service , power distribution and telecommunication networks have been build and operated by private companies and they work just fine . 
  what could be done with motorways/major roads is the same that was done in power distribution and telecommunications , that is government sets and monitors level of service and if the mentioned level of service is not achieved , then customers can claim damages from the company/companies operating and maintaining such roads .
