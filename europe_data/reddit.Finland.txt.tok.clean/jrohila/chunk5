   this is demonstrably false . 
  see how much value the private sector generates if road networks are n't maintained . 
  it is more correct to say the state generates wealth when it manages natural monopolies efficiently . 
  otherwise the private sector does a better job usually . 
  there is no real reason why private sector ca n't build and maintain roads and road networks . 
  for crying out loud , it is usually private companies that make planning , engineering and actual construction of everything . 
  the only thing that public sector does is to tax citizens and companies and re-divert those monies . 
   it is more correct to say the state generates wealth when it manages natural monopolies efficiently . 
  this is the problem . 
  european states are inefficient and bloated . 
  they ca n't handle money responsibly . 
  in north money is spend on oversize bureaucracy and social benefits while in south there are airports where no plane has ever landed and will never land . 
  well , most euro countries actually did that . 
  in central and northern countries social benefits acted as a stabilizer and diverted considerable sums of money to the pockets of people keeping up the consumption . 
  that is why [ german debt to gdp ] ( http://fi.tradingeconomics.com/germany/government-debt-to-gdp ) jumped from 64,9 % in 2009 to 82,5 % in 2011 . 
  i would actually argue that if germany had also launched huge investment projects in 2008/2009 , it would have had a negative effect to the whole global economy as german debt to gdp would have jumped even higher , increasing uncertainty in the market . 
  not to mention that investing into infrastructure only has a point if those investments themselves have a return . 
  spain started a huge amount of investments in 2008/2009 to revive its economy , but what they did was to invest the money in the all wrong places thus deepening spain 's financial crisis . 
  in case of germany , as their infrastructure is already top-notch , it is questionable could the germans in short time found good places to invest . 
  however at the end of the day , it is not the public sector that creates economic growth . 
  economic growth is generated by the private sectors that creates new technologies and invents new way to perform work . 
  the reason growth in europe has lacked is that our political leaders have n't cut down public sector inefficiencies and unneeded legislation that in many countries prevents private sector to grow or renew itself . 
  is it really ? 
  when investing to infrastructure , most of the money is spend on materials , not on wages . 
  not to mention that effect of german or other eurozone countries increasing investments would start to show up at earliest few years from now . 
  actually if we want to get the investment back and make sure we have a good project selection and planning , at earliest projects will start 3-5 years from now . 
   it wo n't be enough alone though . 
  right now the problem is inflation in the euro is too low . 
  the ecb has to commit to seeing its treaty responsibilities of 2 % inflation are met . 
  hugging the lower boundary of 1 % inflation is abuse of the intent of the policy . 
  there is only so much that the ecb can do . 
  responsibility of the central bank should n't be covering or fixing the mistakes of political leaders . 
  yes , that is my estimation too , but i wanted to give him an fair opportunity to prove otherwise . 
  the only thing he would have needed to do is to reply and have a good conversation in finnish language . 
   if you want to cripple a jew , grab him by the throat and hit him in the money . 
   if you want to cripple a jew , grab him by the throat and hit him in the money . 
  this is the first time i have heard that !, 
  from which part of finland do you come and what is your social background ? 
  happy to hear about this experiment and especially about its results . 
  math is really important subject for everybody and thus having children like it more is really important step . 
  on another note , i think that we in europe should do more to learn from each others . 
  our public sectors should actively benchmark each others to find things that others do better and try to ably lesson learned to own working . 
   the community here is very prejudiced against those who are a ) not european and b ) those who are not 100 % behind the confederation of europe into a single country . 
  ** 1 ) ** people who are not european or have not spend considerable time in here are usually just so out of touch that their comments either look ignorant or just plain stupid , thus they get more easily either challenging or negative comments , or just down votes . 
  for example i have heard from brits and other non-europeans that the eurozone will break in ... * 2009 ... 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  not to mention that before that there was the whole debacle of lisbon treaty where the constant rhyme from eurosceptics was ... * it will not be signed * it will not be signed * it will not ratified * it will not be ratified ... * oh , it was ratified , but anyways the eu will break up next year ... * at least the year after that * if not year after that then the next year . 
  you catch my drift ? 
  ** 2 ** ) god damn it !, 
  european union is not confederation of europe that is trying to form a single country . 
  eu is already a * de facto * federation that is on path of becoming * de jure * federation in the future . 
  becoming a single country is not on agenda . 
  single country meaning that we all have the same governmental institutions and systems instead of having different institutions and systems per state . 
  what the federalization of europe means is that in some cases we transfer functionality to european level ( currency ) and in some cases we share the same legislation ( directives ) , and in some cases we have our own way of doing things ( welfare ) . 
  ** question , what were you thinking when you wrote this tirade ? 
  what did you think that you would achieve by doing it ? 
   now , you may make claims about `` efficiency '' and `` productivity '' which are diplomatic ways of explaining how `` northerners '' are superior , by pointing at stuff like luxury cars and heavy machinery . . but you still are n't explaining how a mcdonalds worker `` in the north '' has a much better deal than a mcdonalds worker `` in the south '' . 
  i assure you they are not doing anything different , better or `` superior '' . 
  the reason why mcdonalds worker for example in finland makes more money than for example in cyprus is because the rest of the economy produces more , thus making it possible to pay workers more without making the price of hamburgers unfordable to the target market . 
  if southern economies would be producing more high value products and services , then there would be more purchasing power in the economy to enable higher wages wages even in low value producing sectors of the economy . 
   . . now you come along and tell us that we 're competing with china ? 
  no thanks , mate . 
  i 'd rather we just became protectionist if that 's really what 's going on . 
  i doubt anybody here is looking forward to becoming an expendable $ 300/month slave in some factory -- but if that 's really what is going on , then the `` north '' has way more to fall than the `` south '' . 
  the problem with protectionism is that at the end of the day , you need imports and the only way to pay for them is with exports . 
  the more you produce and the more high value products and services you export , the more you can import . 
  of course you can try to substitute imports as much as possible , but oil , gas and commodities that are not available are not available . 
  in case of high-tech and high-spec products , either they are ridiculously expensive to produce or just impossible to produce . 
   what it starts sounding like , to me , is that `` the north '' wants to create a new `` china '' in the `` south '' -- one that they control economically . 
  otherwise , how do you explain the lack of `` reform '' in the `` north '' ? 
  you were the china before china already . 
  for example in finland our textile and clothing industries died long time ago . 
  now what happened during the last decade is that production moved even more farther away . 
  the only way to respond to this change is to enable the economy to reinvent itself . 
   then you sit down and analyze what kind of `` reforms '' are being pushed through : selling government assets at discounted rates due to desperation [ handing monopolies over to multinational monopolies ] , making it easier for banks to seize your assets , making it easier for your employer to fire you , removing various other work-related rights , cutting your wages ( which were n't even that high to start with ) etc. . 
  while in the scope of an individual , for example making it easier for employers to fire people might be very negative in short term , what it enables in long term is better and more effective resource allocation which again in long term will lead to higher productivity that makes it possible to have higher wages and more jobs . 
  or for example in portugal there has been strict rent controls that has lead to a situation where huge amount of lisbon 's housing is in a state of ruins . 
  if there would have not been rent controls , then the owners would have taken better care of the properties and there would have been additional investment to new housing . 
  another example could be too strict protections for renters in spain , which again has lead to a situation where nobody wants to invest on rent housing , thus leading to a situation where there are n't enough rentable properties which itself has many consequences , one of them of decreased worker mobility . 
   btw , you have my condolences on your country 's economy . 
  i 'm sure you can explain to me the external factors involved in this just as well as i can explain the external factors in my country 's case too . 
  the problem of our economy is that it is not growing , however our gdp per capita ( nominal ) is still one of the highest in the world , so at the moment we do n't have a problem . 
  in case of why it is not growing , it is all due to our own fault . 
  the fault largely lies on our legislation and taxation that curbs companies from growing !, 
  can you imagine that for example taxation of dividends is lower for companies not listed in the stock exchange !, 
  another huge problem is that our public sector is too heavy and demands too much money , thus leaving the private sector on too low fire . 
  all these things are things that we can fix , however to this day we have n't have had enough political will to just fi them . 
   long story short , geography does n't come into this . 
  we made some very bad decisions with how the eurozone works . 
  the ship started sinking , `` northern countries '' were slightly more prepared because they had the top floor , but they 're still standing on a sinking boat ... sinking with the rest of us  well that is defeatist attitude . 
  the thing is that global markets are growing and fast . 
  europe is highly developed , highly educated and highly innovative , if we just let the markets act free , we can make our companies and economy to grow !, 
   i believe it 's better for my family 's future to not be part of the same currency union as germany with the hostile attitude they have towards their `` allies '' . 
  how on earth can you equate demands to reform on being hostile ? 
  the fact of the matter is that developing economies such as china & co. are increasing world wide competition and quickly . 
  already this increase of competition has pushed southern producers from markets that they used to dominate .
