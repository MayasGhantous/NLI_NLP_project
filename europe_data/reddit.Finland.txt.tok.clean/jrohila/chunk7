  the same is true with other kind of repairs . 
  in case of kitchens , they ca n't decide to redo all kitchens . 
  what you have inside your apartment is your responsibility , essentially anything inside your walls . 
  however what is responsibility of the housing stock company is the overall building and its shape . 
  and there is legislation that dictates what a housing stock company can and ca n't do . 
  for example to initiate a major repair like pluming renovation , there has to be an actual need for that and 50 % of stock owners have to accept the decision to start a repair . 
  however what the owners have to take into account is that any damages done by for example leaking pluming will have to compensated by the housing stock company , thus meaning that it will come from the pocket of the owners . 
   not necessarily . 
  money is just a number . 
  if they start devaluing the currency , you are screwed anyway . 
  same if they decide to change the tax rate and your assumptions about the budget are altered . 
  or if you end up with an earthquake in north italy like two years ago . 
  true if you are in imports/exports trade that is conducted outside the eurozone . 
  in case of tax rate , do n't you just pass the cost to your customers ? 
   then go , become a millionaire in italy . 
  i read it , you seriously need to cut down bureaucracy . 
   we ca n't . 
  we do n't have sites , we do n't have uranium , we do n't have places for waste , we do n't have the skills ( all research was shut down in 1986 ) , we have a highly seismic , highly prone to floods country . 
  you have enough sites , for crying out loud , japanease have enough sites , so should you . 
  in case of uranium , you buy that from the world markets , the french would be eager to supply you . 
  same too with plants . 
  and at the end of day when storing the waste , you just build a large tunnel deep enough and that is the end of that . 
   we could produce tons of solar energy , but the germans prefer to put thousans of solar panels on their roofs that generate close to nothing , instead of saying : hi italians . 
  you have a lot of sun , we buy solar panels , you install them on your roofs , and you give back the energy to us . 
  that 's european collaboration . 
  what they are doing is not . 
  you could not produce solar panels , you and neither germans are competetive against chinease producers . 
  not to mention that the whole deal with solar is just huge waste of money . 
  without subsidies , nobody in europe would be installing solar panels . 
   and you think that firing them would solve the issue ? 
  yes , you probably keep the company alive , but now you have plenty of unemployed people . 
  is it really better to drive the company to a point where it ca n't anymore invest into itself and is essentially a zombie , or in a worst case scenario goes bankcrupt ? 
  then you do n't have that company anymore and you still have all those people unemployed . 
  no , the better idea is to let companies scale down operations if and when they need to do so . 
   i can guarantee there are plenty of houses that have been built and sit unsold since ten years . 
  the building market is oversaturated . 
  i doubt that . 
  if there would be enough housing , young italians would move out from their parents either when they start to study or atleast when they graduate and get their first job . 
  however as that is n't happening , i would think there to be a problem with the amount of housing . 
   yes , that 's like in denmark and sweden . 
  they are long term scams . 
  they force you to pay a lot every month , and they are in practice rentals , where suddenly the association decides to redo all the kitchens and you have to shell out other money , additionally , the apartment is not yours and you ca n't do anything with it except live in it . 
  that 's also why your rental market is fucked up . 
  no , you are mixing ** housing stock companies ** to ** right to occupy the appartment housing companies ** . 
  in ** housing stock company ** you buy shares of the company that give ownershpi and right to live/handle certain appartment . 
  in ** right to occupy the apartment housing companies ** you buy just the right to live in an appartment , not ownership of the housing company itself . 
  most appartments in here are of type ** housing stock company ** . 
  for example , my appartment building just turned 54 year old and thus we had a big renovatio : water pipes and plumming ; electricity ; heating ; etc. . systems renewed . 
  the cost of the renovation is 1500e per sqm . 
  our ** housing stock company ** takes care of everything including getting approx 1.5 million eur loan from the bank . 
  after the renovation is over , we the shareholders have a chance to either pay back our share immidiately or in the next 10 years time . 
  it is really handy way to organize everything , and it really does n't cost much . 
  my appartment is only 22.5 sqm and i pay arround 120e per month as maintenance charge that includes property tax + water + heat + cleaning of common areas + other maintenance + company burecracy ( which is outsourced to a hosting company )  but you need to be one not to go bankrupt . 
  there is one simple rule of running a business : track your money flow , if more money comes in than goes out , you are doing fine . 
  of course you also have to track your long term commitments and long term obligations , but still ... 
  i really do n't see what is hard on running a business . 
   i love this kind of logic . 
  stop producing on a mass scale !, 
  do n't you know that you can sustain your economy with just ferragamo and lamborghini ? 
  clothes that are under 500 $ a piece should only be produced in china and bangladesh because ... reasons . 
  because those clothes can be manufactured much more cheaply there than in europe , not only because of labor costs , but also because they have much bigger scales . 
  that is a fact of life . 
  we used to have textile and clothing manufacturing in finland , those days are long gone . 
  the firms that are left either specialised to segments that are small and need special knowhow , or moved their production of the country and concentrated their efforts here to marketing and design . 
   just turn your mass producing factory in a high end prada boutique , with one hundred times the advertising costs and one thousandth of a market . 
  this is just a naive stereotype . 
  you do n't sustain an entire economy and 60 + million people with high end sports car , expensive clothing and wine . 
  italy has much more than that . 
  there is huge industrial base in northern italy . 
  huge amount of small family owned firms that are excellent in their own field , for example making textile machines and highly automated production lines for textile factories in china . 
  that is moving up in the value chain . 
  the thing is that to make those companies to suck all people who were made redundant before , they need flexible legislation to enable growth . 
   which we ca n't do , because that needs infrstructure , and we are already too much into debt for that infrastructure to be developed . 
  if you add that to the de-facto monopoly in telecommunications , the picture is complete . 
  you have quite good infrastructure . 
  while southern italy maybe behind western european standards , northern italy is more than up to standards . 
  of course there is room for improvment such as lowering price of energy , but that the only way to do that is to build nuclear power . 
   hiring and firing employees is already easy . 
  they only give temporary employment ( one year ) contracts since basically 15 years . 
  hiring and firing of permanent employees is not easy and that is the problem . 
  * many bigger companies have big amounts of redundant and ineffective permanent workers . 
  they ca n't get rid of those and they need to use younger less expensive temporary workers to fill the caps . 
  essentially older generations are making the younger generations to pay . 
  * temporary year long contracts still posses risks . 
  market situation can change radically quickly thus in worst case scenario you have people doing nothing for the rest of the year . 
  * temporary year long contracts do n't buy employee loaylty . 
  if you are employing high valued personel , you need to secure them , you need to have permanent contracts . 
  i for example have a permanent contract with my employeer . 
  it means that they ca n't just dismiss me if they do n't like my face . 
  however if in case ... * i fail constantly at my work or behave uncostructively , they can start a procedure to fire me : essentially two written warnings that are accepted by me and the union representative to be valid , which after they could fire me with 1 months compensation ( have been only a year at current employeer ) . 
  the compensation can be max 6 months pay with requirement to work the whole time , but that can be only reached if i stay 10 years in the same employer . 
  * market situation , production or fiscal conditions change and there are redundant workers , firm can start a procedure to fire employees by initiating co-operation negotiations which after they can fire employees they do n't need . 
  of course they ca n't start another round of layoffs in the next 6 months , and if they start hiring again , they need to first check availability of workers from people who were fired . 
  so this is the situation in finland , and the unfortunate trueth is that our legislation is still too rigid and unflexible for small companies . 
   banks do n't give house loans on such contracts , and if you get sick or pregnant , you are not renewed . 
  italian banks requirements to get loans are ridiculously hard thanks to legislation . 
  in here 75 % of the value of the appartment/house being bought acts as collateral , 10 % can be handled by taking an additional insurance , and the last 15 % you need to handle by yourself , for example having your parents give collateral or you having that capital already . 
  anyways , your banks and housing markets are another big internal problem that your legislation has created . 
  first of all , there is n't enough new housing being build . 
  part of the reason being that constructors sell appartment buildins as whole , not as parts .
