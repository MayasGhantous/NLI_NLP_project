  wages are too high , price of energy is too high for industrial users ( 0.125 eur per kwh vs. 0.075 eur per kwh in finland ) . 
  greece has n't anything to turn international companies to invest there . 
  if they need new production it will either go to developing economies in south-east asia or to eastern europe . 
  the only reason why countries such as finland still have some manufacturing industries left is that are specialized on high-tech and high-spec products were the r&d works closely with the factory floor as an integrated unit . 
  another thing to note is that companies here leverage many times suppliers in china . 
  the only way for greece out of this crisis is become more stable and business friendly environment . 
  this means that it should be easier to create startups and easier for current businesses to operate . 
  however even then it will take easily a decade to solve the aftereffects of the current crisis . 
  unfortunately as greece and greek companies are not investing into r&d , it can take even more time to return to any reasonable unemployment numbers . 
   it should n't change the basis that you generate profits in greece , you pay taxes in greece , that said i can see the problem , and it 's another one that will need a ez wide solution ( looking at you double dutch ) . 
  the problem in the greek tax administration , the greek judicial system and enforcement of court decisions . 
  for example in here if a company refuses to pay their taxes , the tax official collect them with force and if necessary will drive the company in bankruptcy and take what they can . 
   25 % unemployment says otherwise , or maybe greek companies are so productive that they do n't need workers either . 
  even when you have high unemployment , it does n't mean that companies would n't be functioning or generating profits . 
  for example the large tourist sector in greece serves mainly foreign customers . 
  this sector still serves the same amount of customers than it did before the crisis and generates the same profits as it did before . 
  what you have to understand that it is not the duty of greek companies to employee unemployed people just because of employing them . 
  if greek companies can increase their profits by hiring people , then they will make it . 
  however the thing is that greece does n't have lot of sector that can just scale production up . 
  first of all in agriculture and in services like tourism industry there is n't just ever increasing demand . 
  second thing is that greece does n't have much manufacturing industries that could scale up their production if there was more demand . 
   also , capital flight is n't something you can just do if your money is tied up in say , a business . 
  warehouses do n't have legs . 
  warehouses still use money . 
  that money that they use has gone from greek banks to other eurozone banks . 
  do remember that the whole euroarea is nowadays one banking area meaning that a german bank functions the same as the greek bank . 
  the businesses have the money , they just do n't want to pay them . 
  if there would be no money , then there would n't have been no flight of money from greece since syriza won the elections . 
   were the netherlands and germany to leave the euro , their new currency/ies would soar in value , destroying the competitive advantage that makes them europe 's `` sugar daddies '' . 
  the competitive advantage of netherlands and especially germany is that they make products and services that the rest of the world want and need . 
  people who buy a new mercedes are not people who think choosing between mercedes and fiat , they are people who are choosing between mercedes , lexus and cadillac . 
  while it is true that a currency that would be formed from netherlands , germany & co. leaving the eurozone would rise in the value , it would n't start a mechanism where italy , spain or greece would become more competitive , it would launch east-sourcing of work from central europe to eastern europe and another wave of automation and drive to increased robotization of work in central europe to mitigate higher employment costs . 
  what the breakup of eurozone would do is to isolate countries are left out from the same currency area were germany is . 
  their companies would incur currency risk and they would incur higher transactions costs thus making them less competitive against producers working with currency used by germany . 
  another thing to note is that southern european countries are not as much competing with germany than with china and producers coming from other developing countries . 
  as long as southern europe does n't start to create more startups and put more money on r&d , then they will suffer from stagnant industries and being pushed to lower levels of global value chain . 
  the future of developed economies is to produce high-tech and high-spec products , services such software and design , etc. . . to the world . 
  simple service and product manufacturing is and will be dying in the developed world . 
  the shortest route with a plane from china to europe goes over northern russia , thus the airports in north are the best hubs for traffic to and from china .

   afaik the 2009-2010 bailout saved the banks and transferred their private debt to the state . 
  am i wrong ? 
  you are wrong . 
  the bailout of greece was the bailout of the greek state , not of banks . 
  * the greek state had been in debt for long , in 2008 the debt to gdp was 105.4 % * the greek budget had been in deficit for the whole decade , in 2008 it was -6.5 % to gdp * when the financial crisis began , the greek budget deficit jumped to record high -15.7 % to gdp in 2010 * the greek primary budget deficit in 2010 when -10.1 % , they had to loan 34 billion eur of new money to just function this is when the first bailout happened , in 2010 . 
  in the first bailout eurozone states and imf loaned greece money to ** fund the primary deficit ** and to ** enable greece to continue paying its loans ** . 
  the idea in that time was that the greek problems were just temporarily and everybody hoped that the economy would recover , however what they did n't know is the extend and dept of the greek financial problems . 
  remember that in 2010 not even the greek state knew how much money it was spending . 
  nor was there factual knowledge on how much debt there is , because at that time both eurostat and the greek statistical office were working furiously to recalculating and going over all the past data and posting corrections after corrections . 
  now the second bailout happened in 2012 when it had became obvious that how deep the greek structural problems were and that there was no chance for it to return to bond markets . 
  the second bailout included extending maturity of loans given to greece by eurozone govermeants , but it also included restructuring of private debts . 
  with the restructuring of private debts , the greek banks took a major hit and needed recapitalization worth 48 billion eur , otherwise the banking sector in the country would have died . 
  so to summarize this ... * the greek state 's existing public debt was transferred to eurozone state by them giving new loans to pay off old loans * the greek state 's new public debt was financed by eurozone states by loaning it directly money to fund the primary deficit gap * the greek banks needed a recapitalization after greek default , this is a side track as essentially with default greece got rid of more debt than it took new . 
  the important thing that many people do n't usually realize that for the eurozone states , especially to states that had no stake in it like finland , it would have been much more beneficial not to bailout greece . 
  yes the european banks had exposure to greek bonds , but that exposure was much more smaller than what has been loaned to greece with the bailout programs . 
  the reason why eurozone states loaned money to the greek state was that when you have a primary budget deficit of -10.1 % , in real money 34 billion eur . 
  the greek budget in total was around 77 billion eur . 
  essentially if the eurozone states would not have bailed out greece , in 2010 the greek government would have had to cut 44 % of its budget . 
  you can just imagine how hard that would have been . 
  the greeks have to snap-out from thinking that socialism and endless expansion of public sector will save them . 
  they do n't know how bad things were in socialist countries , they do n't know how poor the baltic countries were at the end of the soviet union , but they think that due to due to austerity they have it much worse than the balts had it . 
  what i wish the greeks would do is to go out and look how things are done in countries like estonia , slovakia , etc. . . countries that had it bad , but due to non-stop efforts build their countries out of ruins to be successful and growing societies . 
   ah yeah i forgot about the immunity to nazi crimes ... what a great law  the greek victims can make their case in german court , which is much more than what citizens of other countries can do . 
  finland for example had to give 6.5 % of its lands , one of the most industrial and richest provinces to soviet union due to a war of aggression started by ussr , and then pay war reparations to the aggressor state . 
  there is no avenue for the finnish citizens to get reparations , nor for the partisan attacks were soviet partisans killed whole finnish villages deep inside the borders of finland . 
   about 2009 , i think the eu should have boldly stated that they would support any country that stumbled and so kept the loan spreads down . 
  by playing the ` now you fall now you 're good ' game they turned the markets scared more than they already were . 
  that 's when solidarity with europe ended in my mind . 
  from then on , it 's just damage control and lawyers speaking . 
  there was nothing that the eu could have done more than by writing a carte blance to greece and other countries which needed a bailout . 
  the reason why investors got scared and why no more money was coming to greece was because ... * the state had cooked its books . 
  there was more debt and bigger deficits . 
  nobody , not even the greek state , knew the truth . 
  * the greek state could n't account reliably how much money it was spending and where was it going to . 
  * the greek state primary deficit was -10.1 % of the gdp , the country was burning money at enormous speed . 
  now lets say that other eurozone states would have given greece carte blance , then what ... 
  the greek state would n't have had any pressure to do any reforms , not decrease spending , nothing . 
  it would have just kept continuing taking more and more debt until markets would have started to question the situation and started to give negative statements about the countries that were guaranteeing greek debts . 
  the unfortunate thing is that the way greece was bailed out was the most that the rest of the eurozone could do without giving tax payers money to greece . 
  actually currently the other eurozone countries are just doing that , the interest rates of the debt of greek state is so low that it is decreasing just because of inflation alone , in another words the eurozone states are not going to get back their monies in the quantity that they loaned them to greece . 
  and then germany will take greece to the un international court of justice on violating its legal immunity . 
  [ the un 's highest court has confirmed that germany has legal immunity from being sued in foreign courts by victims of nazi atrocities . 
  the international court of justice said that italy 's supreme court violated germany 's sovereignty in 2008 by judging that an italian civilian , luigi ferrini , was entitled to reparations for his deportation to germany in 1944 to work as a slave labourer . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/03/german-immunity-nazi-victims-claims ), 
   the feeling in greece is that the eu threw greece under the bus as soon as problems hit . 
  real friends show themselves during the bad times . 
  so why cooperate and not use all legal means ? 
  is n't what is legal also right ? 
  ( heard it a billion times about the debt ) . 
  let me underline this ... 34 billion eur in 2009 alone ... 
  there was nothing that the eurozone could do in 2009/2010 under the eu treaties . 
  all the eurozone states jumped into action an created the bailout packages for greece and other countries outside the current eu treaties . 
  now what the other eurozone states want to see is that greece tries to get its act together and it seems that is not happening under this government . 
   as for european court , why ? 
  greek courts have jurisdiction over this case . 
  italians have done the same before if i remember . 
  why would the families of distomo go to european court ? 
  [ 3 february 2012 -- the united nations international court of justice ( icj ) ruled today that italy has violated its obligation to respect germany 's immunity under international law by allowing civil claims seeking reparations for nazi war crimes to be brought against it in italian courts . 
  ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=41140#.vqa2zy6fmeq )  in any case , i agree that it is ridiculous that these people have not been compensated since 2000 that the court ruling was made and all governments were just refusing to sign the order to give them their legally appointed money . 
  it seems how much german corruption was reaching deep in the greek state .
