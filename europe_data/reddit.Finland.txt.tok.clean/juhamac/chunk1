they ca n't nest etc. 
  in the water . 
  here 's another recent finnish protest from a week ago . 
  against austerity . 
  state media has reported that finnish authorities regard e.g. 
  northern and southern iraq and the kurdish areas as safe to return to . 
  so there 's probably little chance of them getting a permanent residence . 
  former residents of bagdad , babylon and nineve have a better chance . 
  indeed . 
  these white ghosts scared me . 
  do n't remember other frights related to moomins . 
  alfred j. kwak series on the other hand ... brr or how about this * warning of fragile ice to kids * . 
  music only , no speech , but hits like a truck . 
  good catch . 
  moralism is definitely close to heart in the western sphere . 
  usa is extreme in some degree , sweden quite much so too when you look at what international image they strive for . 
  like this recent debacle , not forgetting that sweden is at the same time almost the highest per capita arms dealer in the world . 
  finland being governed by sweden is revisionism . 
  being sweden could be more appropriate since finland and the whole idea of nationalism did n't exist for the vast majority of time spent under the same royal . 
  read and weep : only 45 tanks in operation : http://cornucopia.cornubot.se/2011/10/insatsorganisation-2014-endast-45.html air force ca n't do dispersed ops any more : http://chefsingenjoren.blogspot.se/2010/07/lfs-2025-del-2-flygbassystemet.html http://wisemanswisdoms.blogspot.se/2008/12/origami.html no extra crews ( neither tanks or jets ) when it 's time to bring out the stuff from the stockpiles . 
  stockpiled tanks would take up to a year to refurb into operative condition . 
  training of the extra crews estimated 1-2 years based on the first link . 
  yes , it used to be much easier to rob the elderly etc. 
  clueless people with heavy cash holdings and currency-based loans with surprise devaluation . 
  why so few ? 
  is it usual ? 
  in finland i think i went through a few hundred rounds in 2 months of basic training . 
  many also continue at a similar rate for the rest of 4 , 7 or 10 months . 
  so it could get closer to a thousand maybe . 
  nordics at the least have a huge amount of hunting weapons . 
  pistols are not very common , mostly due to draconian permit scheme . 
  this proves that the difference between the usa and europe is nothing close to what op might have envisioned : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country, 
  not even close to matching finland . 
  it 's higher tech on average , but it 's a numbers game when you have that much ground to cover . 
  take a look , here 's literally 1/7th of swedish army . 
  which city are you going to defend ? 
  http://www.6mannen.se/wp-content/uploads/7bat.jpg [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.6mannen.se%2fdebatten-som-dog%2f&amp;edit-text= ) this for context : http://www.6mannen.se/debatten-som-dog/, 
  sweden is key to holding the baltic sea , which is russia 's closest route to west ( st. petersburg < -  moscow ) . 
  finland . 
  but it is n't black and white . 
  was it ever under russian rule or just the czar ? 
  success only until russians actually started meddling ? 
  they do n't know if you wo n't tell . 
  both cities are chock full of foreigners so you would n't exactly stand out . 
  if you 're interested in more digging , try forest finns . 
  people from savonia and other parts of inland finland make up a large part of the population in northern sweden . 
  besides the native sami ofc . 
  large numbers of forest finns went also to american colonies . 
  for example the traditional american log cabin is an export from finland . 
  it came with these guys . 
  but it 's for sale . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_aircraft_carrier_pr%c3%adncipe_de_asturias though it has a sister which was built for thai navy , so you could be thinking of that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/htms_chakri_naruebet india bought a russian carrier baku a decade ago . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_vikramaditya then they started on their first new carrier , vikrant ( with help from russians ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_vikrant_ ( 2013 ) for the next one , vishal they want catobar tech from usa , which is far from certain to happen . 
  interestingly enough they still have a ww2 era carrier , but it 's due for decommissioning in 2016 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_viraat_ ( r22 ), 
  airbus could 've easily had even more problems . 
  see for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nhindustries_nh90#concerns_over_performance, 
  there 's also the possibility that they 'll favor american because ideally they 'd like a tech transfer in the future for carrier production . 
  vikrant really has n't been a runaway success and they probably have identified that russians might lack the necessary knowledge themselves to carry indians forward . 
  for vishal they 'd require plenty of tech which really only the americans have . 
  yes , this could be seen as a malfunction of the tradition of consensus . 
  in this realm of politics some people feel like that the consensus has n't been allowed to be challenged . 
  so i guess the perception of the weight of the problems grew and it was treated with nonchalance ( `` first they laugh at you , then they ignore you ... '' ) . 
  then it found its way to the ballots . 
  the failure of other stakeholders to treat the newcomers appropriately has certainly increased their organisation and provided a source of growing sympathy . 
  media and other parties were more willing to vilify the newcomers rather than address problems or even admit them . 
  so they are both a result of the establishment 's action and inaction . 
  like weneedtofederalize described the danish setting , it 's my opinion that it would 've been wise to actually house-train them to obscurity much earlier . 
  at least in finland the popularity is largely seen as a contra-business as usual vote more than pro-whatever these new guys claim to represent . 
  the old left/social democrats are also victim of their own success . 
  they 've done whatever they set out to do starting in the early 20th century . 
  now they lack a world view to the future . 
  in finland they are in progress of extinction due to 0 draw among the youth . 
  i predict leasing gripens will be quite likely outcome by looking at the recent procurements . 
  i 'm quite sure russia would consider passing them to india because of their own need to keep making trades with them ( pak fa , new indian carriers ) . 
  what 's the worst that can happen , mega-city one ? 
  linus torvalds [ aug 10 , 2012 ] ( https://plus.google.com/+linustorvalds/posts/luhjmwpagvi ) `` q : how do you know you are in the middle of nowhere in finland ? 
  a : sometimes your cellphone downgrades from hspa to 3g . '', 
  the great northern war started the reversal of fortunes . 
  as long as the eu keeps adding more countries the harder it becomes to centralize . 
  for example turkey was for long seen as an opportunity that ca n't be missed . 
  but imagine the trouble it would entail . 
  maybe we should prioritize other things than expansion ? 
  verhofstadt 's two layer eu mentioned in limitlessltd 's comment could work ... 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue-water_navy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green-water_navy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown-water_navy, 
  the reservists seem to be doing fine as far as peacekeeping missions go . 
  actives are mostly assigned to training the semi-annual batch of 2x 12,5 k recruits . 
  air force and navy obviously has some active soldiers flying jets etc. 
  that serve in a similar role than in professional armies . 
  since they are nato-compatible they should be very similar to other n. european units . 
  there 's been talks of reducing the reserves to 250k . 
  but that does n't mean the training would become selective . 
  large reserve participation seems to align well with high willingness to defend in case of an attack even if the outcome is unclear . 
  supposedly 76 % agree . 
  obviously if the reserves were mobilized the military would also seize a crapton of boats , cars etc. 
  to support the logistics . 
  you can go to a local military center and ask if your car/boat is already on the list . 
  emergency preparedness is probably one of the best in the world in finland ( with switzerland ) . 
  it 's based on high participation from the private sector .
