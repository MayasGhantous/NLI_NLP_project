  for example the fdf in co-operation police , frontier guard , customs and municipalities has ran for over 50 years now a system of national defence courses , which is billed as the most expensive and most prestigious education in finland . 
  it 's a three week full-time course for the key members of the society on issues linked with the defense of the country . 
  probably everyone who is something has taken part . 
  more about the preparedness here : http://www.nesa.fi/ realistically foreign ops would happen through international forces . 
  like the eu battlegroup http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup the main focus is participating in un mandated missions . 
  they are in no scenario going to face each other . 
  their capabilities against their most relevant threats is more meaningful metric . 
  denmark has to try to defend greenland and faroe islands beside their home waters . 
  sure but the active and operable part was wrong . 
  the training of huge reserve is an activity . 
  finnish navy does n't have the ships for international duties ( brown water navy ) . 
  soon to be mothballed flagship did one tour patrolling the somalian coast . 
  nato-country in a safe geopolitical position has a better chance to participate in international duties . 
  finland does similar international duties than sweden , little less though . 
  but sweden has gone a bit too far in the active & international approach for their own good . 
  danish army does n't have the numbers compared to finnish . 
  they have 19k active + 12k reserves compared to finland 's 36k active + 357k reserves . 
  tanks : 57 leo2a5 's + 6 leo2a4 vs. 100 leo2a6 + 100 2a4 . 
  they have some blue water ships that require a lot of money . 
  finland has one of the largest armies in the world . 
  netherlands 48k active + 30k reserve personnel finland 36k active + 357k reserve personnel poland 120k active + 515k reserve personnel germany 180k active + 40k reserve personnel it 's tasked with national defense unlike most other western armies that prioritize international crisis management . 
  originally around 500 . 
  with current propellants 250 . 
  so the barrels have been replaced at least once . 
  they 've only been used for about 10-15k km and cannons for a few hundred rounds each . 
  so basically the running in has been done . 
  so 2m each is good price compared to modernizing the current batch , which according to the article : `` would have cost $ 5 million per tank , while the procurement of new production tanks would cost about $ 10 million . '', 
  in 2011 the finnish and the swedish green party were also led by husband and wife .

  now if anyone could produce an index comparing performance against the adoption of italian trains - our common enemy . 
  american sports league winners are world champions , whereas others have national champions . 
  it 's a six month ( or 9 , 12 ) system . 
  1-2 years refers to its ability to get you distracted in terms of applying to and starting studies . 
  having to go in or getting released in the wrong part of the year can add up to 2 years wasted . 
  we lately had an article that focused on the journalist 's experiences talking to his highly educated friends in moscow . 
  she summarized it aptly : russians have ( via unrestricted internet ) access to all the relevant sources for information , they just choose not to utilize them . 
  it 's easy to see things that validate your worldview and dismiss the occasional doubts with something trivial . 
  like casually after random talks with an occasional informed tourist branding the individual being a spy for his country . 
  because he/she obviously must be based on the displayed assertiveness . 
  it looks exactly like patria amv . 
  weirdly enough it was n't considered . 
  instead apc g5 , cv90 , ascod and vcbi competed with piranha v to replace 416 m113s . 
  i wonder if patriah\u00e4gglunds goofed by sending cv instead of amv , which is proven by over 1000 + orders already whereas piranha v has none . 
  must be because they also field 90 piranha iii . 
  but they also have 11 `` earlier versions '' of amv in xa-185 . 
  and 45 cv90s . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patria_amv http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piranha_v, 
  show her these : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk16_fszl6o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlxjmklugse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zq0bv41mzc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aud_vzloggq abandon all hope if it 's not enough . 
  but promise that you 'll howl her with the postcards and social media updates during the trip if she does n't come along , 
  here 's everything you need to know about the other dude . 
  https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ffi.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fjon_hellevig&amp;edit-text= ( it 's a google translated wikipedia page ) masters in law , so his background is very similar to iiskola . 
  a pravda columnist with deep russian business background . 
  the last paragraph is where it gets rough . 
  he got disowned by his party while being a candidate for the european parliament , because of what appeared to be a rape threat towards the opera singer . 
  he got 286 votes out of his party 's total tally of 2105 , representing 0.33 % of share of the finnish vote . 
  would n't work with current needs . 
  for example half of this single european pro army would be needed if the current concept of finnish defence was maintained . 
  single european army for foreign military interventions / peacekeeping efforts could work . 
  aw193m http://www.janes.com/article/48102/agustawestland-offers-aw139m-to-slovakia, 
  nothing unusual . 
  there 's so many needs and options that it might be even useful to regard them as separate decisions . 
  finland bought their nh90 's also bare . 
  only this year dillon aero m-134d-h miniguns were selected to their doorguns . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boucdnhggkc ( clip of such weapon being fired ) door guns are n't really the thing that enables them to fly in combat zones . 
  they are useful , but still there needs to be either air superiority or armed escort choppers . 
  manpads are trouble . 
  finland originally tinkered with the idea of getting attack helicopters to escort them , but it was ( luckily ) a pipedream . 
  so the political compromise 10 years later , now that the acquisition is done , is to arm the transport helicopters . 
  what 's interesting that they 'll only install the weapon to the doors when necessary . 
  it 's supposedly only about an hour of work . 
  in finland there 's no good overall analysis . 
  aamulehti , a national tabloid did an internal survey ( n = 73 ) in 2010 . 
  37.3 % told that they usually vote the green party . 
  national coalition ( their swedish peer is moderaterna ) got 24 % , centre party got 8 % . 
  so it 's more than likely green-left also in finland . 
  the finns and centre party have severe underrepresentation . 
  national coalition might have too , since aamulehti is considered more slanted towards them than average . 
  social democrats will soon lose their representation in the media , since their voters are dying and there 's complete lack of youth support . 
  youth is owned by the national coalition and the greens . 
  the left alliance also enjoys good youth support , but it 's a bit tricky because their youth org is the only whose members are n't automatically members of the party itself . 
  sweden has more characteristics of a class-based society ( `` aristocrats '' ) than finland . 
  so there 's more group identification to begin with . 
  in finland there 's for example very little old money so the social mobility is more pronounced . 
  sweden desperately wanting to be the most progressive is one thing that makes a difference . 
  finland on the other hand has numerous ideological conservative minorities , like the revivalist movements in the north , east and northwest , like : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/awakening_ ( religious_movement ) , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laestadianism ( pm juha sipil\u00e4 's sect ) , and the fifth revivalists aka neo-pietists ( mofinterior p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen 's sect ) . 
  excellent for growing potatoes . 
  do n't worry , at least your capital is a beauty . 
  indeed . 
  there 's more than one way to skin a cat . 
  more spike-ers to shores , outfitting 2-4 choppers to asw . 
  like a pair nh90 nfh or something more nimble to operate from vl turva . 
  or expand the pair of coast guard 's new super pumas capabilities from sar to include asw in times of crisis . 
  if new , asw choppers could be bought with sweden , maybe even operated in tandem . 
  i 'm fully in agreement with boats  ships for finland . 
  finland also has rather unique needs and possibilities in terms of ice breakers . 
  you probably would n't want to arm those . 
  still their capabilities are vital in military scenarios . 
  well , for example confiscating summer houses from swedes to be used as dwellings for the immigrants sounds rather thick bs . 
  sure . 
  but sweden has similar archipelago , especially around stockholm .
