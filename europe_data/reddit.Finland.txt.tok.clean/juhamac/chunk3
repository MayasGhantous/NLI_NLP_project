  and they have kept their subs even if everything else has been slashed . 
  the path is shared with all nordic countries . 
  the numbers are going down so fast that they would even consider just slowing the rate of decline a victory at this point . 
  apparently active church attendance in finland is somewhere around 3 % membership . 
  in sweden a bit less , in norway a bit more . 
  that 's kitchen paper . 
  toilet paper roll is half the size of that . 
  i read this more as an excuse to continue stalling today . 
  usually these releases have more to do with the political needs of today rather than being just objective flashes of history . 
  quite surely the cheapest to operate since it 's the smallest one . 
  but cost effectiveness needs to be evaluated by looking into the abilities , not just cost . 
  one of gripen 's major weaknesses is in the air to ground department . 
  sweden also lacks relevant experience in that regard . 
  finland 's requirements have recently extended into this realm , which leads me to believe that it will hurt gripen 's chances slightly . 
  wikileaks public dump due in may i believe . 
  big part is due to early identification and intervention of learning difficulties/disabilities . 
  if those are not spotted early on they end up dragging people down for years and you really ca n't take back the early foundational years . 
  freedom afforded by the trust placed on the teachers is big . 
  pacing of school day ( 15 minute breaks between classes ) and no high pressure testing until end of 6th year probably matter too . 
  he actually might since the current pm sipil\u00e4 has been consistently failing in everything . 
  still it 's only rhetorical power compared to pm 's actual , but it might make a difference . 
  kind of like the minister of interior orpo has risen to become `` the man '' because of his reassuring handling of this matter . 
  the norwegian bit near the antarctica is called [ bouvet island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) . 
  the most remote island in the world !, 
  also oddly has something to do with liverpool and aliens . 
  [ translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.iltasanomat.fi%2fkotimaa%2fart-1451881705758.html&amp;edit-text= ) the google translation is actually hilariously bad in some parts , like the picture label : `` president sauli niinist\u00f6 disappointment , however judging was not jokerit and vikings kiekkoilevien boys estimates that for the first time in the field '' . 
  should actually say `` based on the president 's playing style the juniors , who play with jokerit and viikingit , thought that this was n't his first time at a hockey rink '' . 
  professor of history jukka korpela from the university of eastern finland has [ talked about it ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140415084148.htm ) , he 's even quoted several times in your article . 
  though it 's true that many are ignorant about the fact . 
  apparently laymen are only interested about recent things and weird pagan mythologies of our native past . 
  the rest comes from non-domestic western sources , even popular culture . 
  as a non-expert it seems hard to get the big picture on slavery . 
  it seems so commonplace in history with the general devastation brought on by skirmishes , wars . 
  his style of speech is just perfect fit for that gaming project . 
  i ca n't think of many others who do it in a such pronounced way . 
  i think africa itself offers easily enough variety among outcomes to make fruitful comparisons . 
  even among the countries that come from the same subset , like west africa . 
  finland did n't really exist before . 
  it was just sweden , one and the same for 650-700 years . 
  western coastal cities were closer to stockholm in political and real world terms than some further parts of sweden proper . 
  during the russian times it was kept as a some sort of hassle free ( unlike poland that was a hotbed of rebellions ) separate entity under the czar . 
  almost everything was practiced independently except state level foreign politics . 
  in the latter part of the period they unfortunately tried to start russification , which was a catastrophic mistake . 
  compliant turned into stubborn . 
  in exchange for the autonomy and relaxed control , the finnish guard had to actually take part in russian foreign ventures like the crimean war . 
  unlike those , for the short lived swedish colony business and swedish wars in general i consider historical finns equally implicated . 
  for 1995 the highlight is most definitely [ joining the european union ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/4413130/landscape16_9/1024/576/7f4fc5b33fe10bb101c075dc5f3b186c/it/eu-nostalgia.jpg ) , not ice hockey gold . 
  in picture our current president , then minister of justice . 
  1952 olympics is also too one off occasion to appear in this list . 
  instead add 1968 when the legal base for establishing [ comprehensive schooling ] ( http://ylaaste.jamsa.fi/tunnilta.jpg ) ( transformation done by 1980s , which is where the pic is from ) was put in place . 
  that and great pre-school education and you get 2000s pisa success . 
  makes for a nice larger subject . 
  nokia turned into gaming companies of today and best networked/mobile society could be the 5th picture if the 1917 independence part was taken as something that needs no further explanation . 
  or actually instead of nokia it might be worth highlighting the open source movement . 
  linux , irc , mysql and ssh . 
  what do you think about the israeli part ? 
  would it make any sense to consider joining as possible ? 
  finnish-american [ haddon sundblom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haddon_sundblom ) came up with the red coated santa for the iconic coca cola ads . 
  sundblom 's santa debuted in 1931 . 
  it was supposedly based on a salesman . 
  http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-lore-santa-claus/ the commercial part of santa owes much to those . 
  [ reindeers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpktub8iub0 ) ( rudolf ) are iconic lapland and sami/s \u00e1pmi . 
  cost saving reasons do n't fit . 
  if it was the reason then the whole air-to-ground capability would n't have been introduced in the mlu2 . 
  standoff-weapons came in probably because land mines had to be demolished . 
  one deterrent changed to another . 
  yes , hornet was underutilized but is n't any more . 
  no-one is planning a dogfighter with amraams . 
  the requirement is for a multirole fighter . 
  payload differences wo n't make a real difference in this competition . 
  but do note that for other than f-35 three hardpoints need to be reserved for two cfts and one targeting pod to achieve similar range and targeting ability . 
  for f-35 you are only supposed to fill the internal bay . 
  4x amraam is one foreign f-35 load-out template i found for counter-air . 
  does n't sound unreasonable for us . 
  the reasoning ca n't be based on peace time needs . 
  when you 're planning for scenarios where you intend to fire missiles you 're going to want capacity . 
  because realistically you need at least two missiles per kill and for ground attack missions you want to retain reasonable anti-air capability . 
  one on one it probably is , but comparing fighters is not enough . 
  russian a2/ad systems like s-400 can cover much if not most of finland 's airspace from their side of the border . 
  hornet fits to the needs very well . 
  otherwise it would n't have been upgraded with two multi-billion mid-life upgrade packages . 
  the latest one affirms the growing need for ground strike capability . 
  standoff-weapons have also been only recently introduced into the defense doctrine . 
  it 's true that the hornet selection was in retrospect rather weirdly justified ( `` two engines '' and `` getting amraam instead of sparrow '' ) and included heavy security policy considerations . 
  but we are n't buying right now . 
  2021 with deliveries from 2025 to 2030 . 
  the issue of domestic maintenance will be interesting to see how it plays out . 
  all fighters will be run with less than 1/3 weapon payload for most of their service life . 
  f-15 is a no go . 
  costs nearly as much as f-22 to operate . 
  even affluent saudi arabia did n't pick silent eagle , instead opted for cheaper sa-version . 
  israel is probably the smallest country that can afford to operate f-15 . 
  no , i 'm saying that gripen numbers are completely untrustworthy at this point . 
  c/d numbers obviously ca n't be used and e/f price tag is still a mystery since no production planes have been built . 
  assessing the maintenance costs will become easier within a few years . 
  finland has until 2021 before the deal is signed . 
  jassm can be fitted to others ( via universal armament interface aka uai ) . 
  it cost about 50 million dollars to the current finnish f/a -18 c/d and has taken several years . 
  50m vs. the purchase price of the jets is meaningless , so it wo n't be a deciding factor . 
  but all of rafale 's weapons are foreign to us , which is a problem .
