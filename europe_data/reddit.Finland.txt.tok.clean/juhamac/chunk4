  gripen , typhoon and especially the american jets do n't suffer from this . 
  all but rafale use amraam as their main weapon , like our brand new and second most expensive acquisition ever , [ nasams ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasams_2 ) surface to air defense system . 
  so there is definite synergy . 
  swiss gripen price : [ 159 million ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-18/saab-loses-3-5-billion-jet-order-as-swiss-reject-gripen ) brazilian gripen price : [ 150 million ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-sweden-saab-idusl1n1091ut20150729 ) norwegian f-35a price : [ 156 million ] ( http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/167212/weak-krone-hikes-norway%e2%80%99s-f_35-price.html ) dutch f-35a price : [ 151 million ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150323143631/http://www.janes.com/article/47093/netherlands-commits-to-first-operational-f-35s ) slightly different packages , but still should indicate that the differences are n't as big as some people assume . 
  f-35 price is also going down steadily ( already cheaper than ef and rafale ) and it has n't even reached full rate production , where economies of scale matter the most . 
  gripen might not get another sale between now and the finnish decision . 
  brazil also has their own line , so there are no real production efficiency gains to be realized . 
  super hornet line on the other hand is very likely to close before 2025 . 
  these are a bit hard to compare since most operators include different things in their hourly costs . 
  lowest number includes only fuel usage and expendables . 
  higher ones account for maintenance costs and depot work . 
  cost per flight hour also balloons if the total amount of yearly flight hours is low , e.g. 
  like swiss/austrian jets compared to basically anyone else . 
  everyone besides f-35 needs external pods and conformal fuel tanks and their maintenance should be included in the cost . 
  especially beware of often quoted 5-7k / h gripen number which is based on the older version . 
  newer one is larger and has a new engine . 
  altogether 90 % different parts according to brazilians , so reliable data will arrive only in the future . 
  first production gripen e will appear in 2019 . 
  gripen could very well be the cheapest to operate , since it 's the smallest . 
  f-35 is somewhere between f-16 and f-15 / 22 . 
  jassm cruise missile has 300km range . 
  or 1000km if there is further interest and permission to buy the extended range version in the future . 
  basically it 's preventive capability . 
  it means that a potential attacker wo n't be safe just by returning to their own area . 
  based on swiss , indian and brazilian quotes gripen e/f costs very similar amount than the other candidates . 
  it has a very slow rate of production . 
  50k hours and 2 years each , mostly by hand and only with one robot . 
  full rate f-35 production will be completely different . 
  any jet that can operate from carriers can utilize roads . 
  basically all mentioned . 
  `` white flags and dropped rifles ? 
  the real truth about working with the french army '' by chris hernandez :  many americans have asked me , `` is it true the french served wine at dinner and had wine in their mres ? '' the answer is yes and no . 
  they not only served wine at dinner , they sometimes served it at lunch as well . 
  the firebase i was on , which was n't that big , had three bars . 
  the regular french joes could have all the alcohol they wanted in their tents . 
  i went on a week-long mission to a combat outpost with a french recon platoon . 
  the outpost was at the furthest edge of coalition control , surrounded by taliban . 
  one of their company xo 's , a captain , accompanied us . 
  when we occupied the outpost , the first thing the troops did was pop open beers and break out steaks to grill . 
   i had a conversation with the french captain about stupid things that happen in the american military , like the sergeant major and captain in iraq whose only apparent duty was screaming at troops in the dfac for wearing paracord bracelets . 
  i 'll never forget the captain standing there totally relaxed with a beer in hand , without armor or helmet , troops drinking and grilling behind him , telling me , `` things like that do n't happen in the french army . '' so yes , the french could drink as long as it did n't interfere with their duties . 
  but alas , the french mres i saw did n't have wine rations . 
  sorry , guys . 
  oh , and i do n't remember seeing even one french soldier wearing a reflective belt . 
  we were sweden . 
  spreading europe to other parts of the world . 
  portugese/spanish colonial adventures . 
  or the east india company and especially the dutch voc could be interesting ( call it the spice must flow ) ... you could focus more on their effects at home instead of abroad if you wanted it to be europe-focused . 
  yes . 
  besides the high desire for neutrality we have to remember that even though there was war finland maintained diplomatic relations with the usa until june 30 , 1944 . 
  the breakup lasted for less than a year and usa never declared on finland . 
  britain did and i think it was the only ww2 case of a democracy declaring on another . 
  helsinki was also among the participants the only continental capital to not get occupied during the war . 
  then again , the german contingent in the north , especially at the petsamo nickel mines was on occasion rather massive . 
  astrophysicists . 
  i 'd be much more relaxed about reading oversimplifications if they were made by aviation experts . 
  aileron positions etc. 
  are not known . 
  worst of all wind resistance is not accounted for . 
  finland 's exports are very highly based on investment goods ( those things that foreign companies buy in order to grow - like industrial boilers ) . 
  when we still had markka it was constantly abused by speculants like soros . 
  part of the problem was of course our politicians , who stayed headstrong with ideas like `` strong currency '' for too long and then took the easy way out with repeated devaluations . 
  simply put it 's too volatile . 
   kepu pett\u00e4\u00e4 aina aimo kairamo , managing editor of the social democrat party 's magazine popularized it . 
  at least from the 70s . 
  egyptian army also has major interest in the tourism industry . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18548659 or is egyptian army the state ... who knows . 
  because of different kind of automatically applied deductions , it 's been estimated that you pay 0 % state taxes until your yearly wages top 30,250 euros . 
  technically you should start paying 6.5 % starting from 16,100 eur yearly wages . 
  municipal taxes are mandatory though . 
  they are 19.84 % on average . 
  but municipalities are also responsible for most of the health/social care costs ( over half of their budgets go there ) . 
  value added tax and other sales taxes provide about 32 % of all tax income . 
  only slightly less than the share of state income tax , 36 % . 
  as a comparison , in the usa income tax share was 43 % and sales taxes 18 % . 
  both numbers are from 2010 . 
  crisis averted for now . 
  pm sipil\u00e4 and finm stubb tweeted 10 minutes ago ( at 1am local time ) that they 've reached an agreement . 
  http://valtioneuvosto.fi/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/x-1?_101_instance_3wysllo1z0ni_groupid=10616 centre party got their desire of regionalization and coalition party freedom for the patient to choose among public/private/voluntary sector provide . 
  dude , it 's even in the name . 
  here 's the earlier decision of income support moving from municipalities to kela ( state social insurance institution ) by 2017 . http://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/paatos-tuli-toimeentulotuki-siirtyy-pois-sossun-luukulta-3454365, 
  too simple way of putting it imo . 
  more conservative way would be to say that they 'd like to increase the amount of choice and make the money follow the patient . 
  eu patient directive ( dealing cross border healthcare ) is used as a tangential reasoning for enabling this . 
  the directive allows choice across the border , so it 's not far fetched to implement something similar domestically . 
  but how to organize the production of the services is still an open question regardless of patient 's ability to choose . 
  the centre party is former agrarian league . 
  this is still evident in their support base . 
  urbanization is hitting their power base hard . 
  to combat this the centre party has a long standing desire to create an extra layer of administration at the regional level . 
  in effect to funnel support from all those small municipalities against regional centres , that are more likely to be coalition party or social democratic party power bases . 
  here 's [ a telling picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/eduskuntavaalit_2015.png/220px-eduskuntavaalit_2015.png ) . 
  green = centre , blue = nat con , red = soc dem , yellow = the finns , orange = swedish pp . 
  denoting the largest party in each municipality . 
  this time around the centre party is trying to marry the regional change along with the social and healthcare reform . 
  national coalition party on the other hand would just like to make social and healthcare reform . 
  their fear is that at worst this new regional administration could even be allowed to start taxing . 
  currently each municipalities ' parties select their representatives to serve at the regional level , which has a hand only in the broad aspects of regional planning and distributing some eu fund money . 
  the social welfare and health care reform is a big deal even without considering the proposed changes to regional administration . 
  it is taking 50 % or more of municipalities ' yearly budget out of their hands .
