  this must have something to do with the ever popular micro loans . 
  like it still would n't be massive . 
  in 2014 sickness benefits in sweden were 26 billion kronor or 3.05 billion dollars [ in total ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5622939 ) . 
  translation : swedish armed forces and finnish defence forces have today decided to create a joint naval task force . 
  the government has stated earlier that developing defence cooperation with finland is a priority . 
  creating a joint naval task force is a priority for the navy . 
  the goal is cost-effective sharing of joint naval resources and abilities . 
  developing joint readiness sfntg aims to ascertain joint capabilities in international crisis management ops , the ability to work together with nato and to enable joint placement to the nato reserve force register , response force pool . 
  in the long term sfntg will have operational capacities in marine surveillance and marine safety . 
  it will operate under swedish jurisdiction . 
  the swedish government will appoint a commission to affirm the legal base of cooperation . 
  using foreign harbours some talk about bilateral agreements to use danish and finnish ports during peace , when there are joint operations in said area or an international training nearby . 
  the site is government offices of sweden - regeringskansliet . 
  in the newspapers : [ metro.se ] ( http://www.metro.se/nyheter/marin-stridsgrupp-ihop-med-finland/hdzojc!qccnrjjch2gbd15bbreacq/ ) , [ aff\u00e4rsv\u00e4rlden ] ( http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article3942634.ece ) [ earlier article ] ( http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/en/news/2015/05/sweden-and-finland-combine-forces-in-a-joint-naval-training-initiative/ ) at the swedish armed force 's site from may describes preparation ( in english ), 
  my guess is that when sweden buys something it will move some of its old stock to lithuania . 
  they have for example massive stocks of [ bandvagn 206 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandvagn_206 ) which would be better used in the baltics than just stored away . 
  smaller ones will be probably similar than between finland and estonia . 
  like the [ groundmaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ground_master_400 ) radars . 
  finland bought 12 and estonia 2 in one deal . 
  conscripts probably are n't nearly as much motivated to engage in foreign adventures compared to national defense . 
  because the other way around there would be massive ghettos . 
  spreading the city owned housing everywhere instead of concentrating it is the easiest way to prevent this development . 
  if they can send even some here , they might not be operating with razor thin margins . 
  but clearly there is at least some quality control problem since this moldova-incident happened . 
  we get some of them here . 
  so i doubt the narrative of razor thin margins forcing moldova . 
  please someone inform her that we 're willing to take them at a bargain price to improve our nato-compatibility . 
  that way bw and the german mod could get a waterproof excuse for replacing them . 
  it would also make it much more likely that we 'd end up buying extra h&k 416/7 in the future . 
  our problem is that we need a ton of affordable rifles for the reserves , which has held us hostage with the 7.62 \u00d7 39 . 
  everyone would come out as a winner from this . 
  no interest aka every other major was allied to su . 
  pizza-flavored viru valge might sell better . 
  good catch . 
  it 's actually [ 14 % ] ( https://www.vero.fi/fi-fi/yritys_ja_yhteisoasiakkaat/liikkeen_ja_ammatinharjoittaja/arvonlisaverotus ) these days ( food / meals / restaurant services and animal fodder ) . 
  yep . 
  bread and butter . 
  just remember how the f-22 had those awful oxygen problems , which caused respiratory problems to the pilots . 
  the dutch probably made a ton of boats/ships from their trees . 
  clogs likely account for nothing in comparison . 
  yes of course . 
  nato comes to play in every scenario . 
  the uk should be really good carrier-wise within five years when both qe 's are in commission . 
  motivation plays a large part too . 
  i think that 's poland 's trump card compared to countries like germany . 
  sure but the uk does operate around the world and has experience , support and everything that china hopes to have . 
  the chinese ( russian ) aircraft carrier is not really useful for anything but practice for building domestic carriers . 
  they are starting from scratch where it comes to operating one . 
  the uk has a rather recent example of successful defense of the falklands . 
  located very close to the aggressor but they still kept it . 
  obviously it ca n't be extended to considering war against china , but it shows that uk 's power projection capability today far surpasses the chinese . 
  but two decades should make all the difference . 
  it depends . 
  if the conflict happened anywhere outside of southeast asia the chinese army would be a non-factor . 
  poland is retiring their older t-72s which will make their numbers comparable to what germany has now . 
  germany is going from 250 to 350 . 
  their leos are newer on average . 
  this will probably clinch it : `` funding permitting , the german army hopes to get finance to enable its complete fleet of leopard 2a6 mbts to be upgraded to the latest leopard 2a7 standard . '', 
  http://www.janes.com/article/46904/germany-receives-first-leopard-2a7-mbt poland 's recent efforts have been much more promising though . 
  rather simplistic chart . 
  has only active personnel . 
  wartime strengths would be better . 
  countries get penalized if they forego any of the items like attack helicopters or submarines - using that money in another category wo n't give similar amount of points . 
  artillery is n't rated ? 
  in the end it 's really hard to compare armies with heavy international focus to something that exist only for defensive purposes . 
  life in the borderlands is somewhat different from the sheltered central countries . 
  naval focused countries like the netherlands also get shafted in this chart . 
  best equipped = !, 
  most powerful ( example iraq , other gulf countries ), 
  you are right . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2012-news/may/460-russian-stealth-frigate-qdagestanq-project-11661k-tests-new-3m14te-p-900-missiles-in-sea-trials.html ) is talking about 3m14te , which according to following site is ( export , surface-launched ) . 
  http://www.designation-systems.net/non-us/soviet.html there 's still no reliable source for the range of the domestic version . 
  this is a rather telling picture . 
  swedish and danish flags flowing besides the major colonial powers flags ' at the canton treaty port in 1820s . 
  interesting . 
  wikipedia gave everything needed to come to the same conclusion . 
  dagestan + three buyans according to the description in that video . 
  i just missed that dagestan probably also has vls which can fit the same missiles , which makes the range description of 300km in my first link obsolete . 
  try with bulava . 
  it should be related at least according to their nato-designation ss-n-30 . 
  the only western thing i can find is a vague reference to ash carter warning about these . 
  this seems to be one source for the range ( looks rather shady , but ash carter 's statements should be easy to find ) . 
  though it states between 620 and 923 miles , not 2500km . 
  * dagestan * , the only one in gepard-class equipped with kalibr-nk . 
  http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2012-news/may/460-russian-stealth-frigate-qdagestanq-project-11661k-tests-new-3m14te-p-900-missiles-in-sea-trials.html range of 300km does n't cut it . 
  * grad sviyazhsk , uglich * and * veliki ustyug * of buyan-class on the other hand have vls-cells which could theoretically have any type of kalibr . 
  wiki states that 3m-14 / 3m-14t has a range of 2500km , which would certainly be enough . 
  an inertial guidance land attack variant deployed by the russian navy . 
  the submarine-launched weapon has a basic length of 6.2 m ( 20 ft ) , with a 450 kg ( 990 lb ) warhead . 
  its range is 1,500 -- 2,500 km ( 930 -- 1,550 mi ) . 
  its subsonic terminal speed is mach 0.8 . 
  * 3m-14t - dod designation ss-n-30a ; is the inertial guidance land attack variant which is deployed by the russian navy . 
  a surface ship with vls launched missile , with thrust vectoring booster , its basic length is 8.9 m ( 29 ft ) , its warhead weight and other performance are the same as the 3m-14 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3m-54_klub i guess it 's possible that they have loaded their buyans with the newest missiles . 
  after all this has rather high propaganda value . 
  even though they do n't export variants that have a range of more than 300km due to mtcr treaty . 
  certain sources state that they were launched with cooperation from iran & iraq , but who knows . 
  western sources have n't really confirmed anything yet . 
  these were used : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3m-54_klub, 
  not only fur .
