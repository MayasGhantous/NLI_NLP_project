  white haired nordic slaves sold at the crimean khanate slave market were the hottest item of medieval slave trade . 
  novgorod was the slaver base for raids into karelia . 
  http://mikedashhistory.com/2015/01/15/blonde-cargoes-finnish-children-in-the-slave-markets-of-medieval-crimea/ `` the prices they commanded , however , were simply colossal ; one source notes that girls who could be purchased for as little as 5 altyn in karelia could be resold for 6,666 altyn even before they reached the khanate -- a mark up in excess of 133,000 percent . 
  the higher price , equivalent to 200 roubles or ( in about 1600 ) 250 sheep , was also about five times the usual price for a crimean slave . 
  it is no surprise , in these circumstances , that slaves from the far north were highly sought-after for their colouring -- nor that their special characteristics were scrupulously noted in the slave registers so carefully kept in the ports that lay at the heart of this commerce in human misery : `` white skin , white hair . '' '', 
  even the `` unless you have too much '' does n't strictly apply . 
  venezuela is a prime example . 
  russia is a black sea country so it has its own restrictions regarding capitals passing the turkish straits . 
  for example the russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov was built by the black sea shipyard . 
  `` although the treaty is often cited as prohibiting aircraft carriers in the straits , there is no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers in the treaty . 
  however , the tonnage limits in article 14 , which apply to all non-black sea powers , would preclude the transit of modern aircraft carrying ships . 
  in the case of non-black sea powers , these terms make it impossible for transit any modern ships carrying aircraft through the straits without violating the terms of the convention . 
  by contrast , black sea powers such as the ussr were able to transit aircraft carrying cruisers through the straits under other terms of the convention . 
  as with non-black seas powers , the montreux convention does not explicitly forbid a black sea power from transiting aircraft carriers through the straits , and the tonnage limits in article 14 also apply to black sea powers as well as non-black sea powers . 
  however , under article 11 , black sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of any tonnage through the straits . 
  annex ii specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ships , but limits the definition of carriers to ships that are designed primarily for carrying and operating aircraft at sea and specifically excludes other ships that merely are able to operate aircraft . 
  the result of this is that by designing its aircraft carrying ships such as kiev and admiral kuznetsov to have roles other than aircraft operation and by designating those ships as `` aircraft carrying cruisers '' rather than `` aircraft carriers '' the soviet union was able to transit its aircraft carrying ships through the straits in compliance with the convention , while at the same time the convention denied access to nato aircraft carriers , which are not covered by the exemption in article 11 . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits sounds ridiculously bureaucratic . 
  kuznetsov-carrier allowed , western not . 
  basically due to technicality . 
  no , it 's due to their inability to build such vessels . 
  there 's no lack of willingness to have those , like mistrals . 
  navy has been their weakness since the collapse of the su . 
  only submarine production is good . 
  new surface warships have been restricted to corvette/frigate size . 
  this dude is supposedly the embassador of donetsk people 's republic in finland . 
  so he 's an ambitious activist all right , but human rights might not be his primary interest . 
  here 's a finnish newspaper clip from 1967 that displays sweden 's numbers : https://twitter.com/vegarus/status/648905847096143872 it says army 600 000 men , air force 24 000 men and ca . 
  900 planes , navy 12 000 men and 8 destroyers , 21 submarines . 
  in that picture switzerland is more surprising . 
  army 658 000 men , air force 50 000 men and 400 planes . 
  yugoslavia is the third mentioned with 220 000 men in the army and 20 000 men in the air force with 400 planes . 
  surprise surprise : https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3n036u/til_in_finland_nearly_every_newborn_is_sent_home/ ( 12hrs ago , 3590 upvotes ), 
  it makes it at least once a year . 
  yes , 40cm sea ice/70cm fjord ice mentioned here seems similar . 
  http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/knud-rasmussen-class/ ours need to be able to crack 60cm of baltic ice , because the ones that they are due to replace had that capability and the other ships are restricted to much less icy conditions . 
  147 of these account for half of the swedish numbers : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cb90-class_fast_assault_craft 100 of these : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g-class_landing_craft, 
  sounds good . 
  i hope we get similar bang for the buck with half the tonnage . 
  we need ice breaking ability though . 
  it 's the biggest . 
  the artillery also continues to practice some things that are completely out of reach these days by other western european militaries . 
  on the other hand most do n't have a pressing need for thwarting potential mass assault . 
  like here , 800 rounds on target . 
  visby is pretty , but finnish boats have similar armament plus anti-air missile capability , which visby is notably lacking . 
  so for 150 million apiece they are average at best . 
  iver huitfelds or fridtjof nansens are clearly the alpha primes among the pack . 
  do you happen to know how much one iver cost ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visby-class_corvette https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamina-class_missile_boat finnish navy is looking to buy 110m and 2-3k ton corvette/frigates in 2020 . 
  four and a total cost of 1.2 bn euro is being thrown around . 
  so it 's possible that they will become the 2nd biggest mo-fo 's around . 
  f-35 is favourite just by looking at the deals done by norway , netherlands et al. 
  sweden has 75 gripen c and 25 gripen d ( many of these were remanufactured from outdated/mothballed 105 gripen a and 13 gripen b ) . 
  c/d are on par with the neighbors ' f-16 's and f-18s , except air to ground - wise , where they are lacking compared to finnish f/a -18 s. 
  all of them are to be replaced with 70 new e ( formerly ng ) between 2018-27 . 
  basically the air force numbers are too optimistic across the board and the number for the navies is completely nuts . 
  would 've made sense to stick with the numbers that are currently operational . 
  yes . 
  i find it weird too since you 've only just recently announced joint tank force with the germans etc. 
  by the way , thanks for leo 2a6 . 
  good trade . 
  finnish security policy could be seen as hinging on maintaining perceived capability to maneuver . 
  i say perceived because in reality that same thing might cause finlandization-effect aka having to bend over toward all directions . 
  maintaining ability to politically maneuver as a guiding principle means the country must remain non-allied . 
  i personally question whether this does any good compared to admitting that we 've already chosen and doing the final step to acknowledge that ( join nato ) . 
  in this light eu army might be used as a diversion to stall the question of nato membership . 
  those plans will never amount to anything when over 80 % + of western european military power is already in the nato . 
   practically being the same country for a century or however long it was 550 + years , from around 1240 to 1809 . 
  estonia was a swedish dominion for 160 years , between 1561 and 1721 . 
  my friend bought a ted cruz mug and some other campaign gear . 
  not long after they ended up returning the money . 
  sleeping in a box is preferred to shared bed because of lowered possibility of crib death . 
  alcohol/smoke , suffocation ( pillows , duvets ) , adult rolling over - usual dangers when sleeping side by side . 
  unless someone is allergic , cat will probably just improve baby 's immune system . 
  some cats are also kept completely indoors , so no ticks/fleas . 
  i think it still has more to do with same starting point than same results . 
  but specifically quotas can be bad in the way which you describe . 
  nothing else comes to mind besides that there were plenty of women ( 19 out of 200 ) elected to the parliament in the first election . 
  in some countries the first opportunity to place & vote women did n't produce instant results . 
  nevertheless , the [ first parliamentary election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_parliamentary_election,_1907 ) was in 1907 . 
  autonomy mainly restricted foreign politics . 
  rather interesting approach :  the winner of the award does not receive the prize money , but rather identifies an issue or action that advances equality , and the money goes toward that cause . 
  the organisers hope that the choice of award winner , and that person 's actions , will exemplify how investments in equality support every society . 
  the baby box is a way to ensure that everyone enlists at the maternity ward . 
  check ups and advice received there goes hand in hand with the box . 
  to get it you need proof of pregnancy from a doctor , which states that the pregnancy has lasted for 154 days and there 's been a doctor 's check up before 5th month . 
  take another look . 
  most of the long lasting historical entities seem to be empires . 
  basically you do n't get to become an empire without extended period of success . 
  there 's also incredible variety . 
  for example colonial empires . 
  i wonder if any historical entity shaped the world as much as those . 
  despite this , empire seems to the most successful form of governance throughout history . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.x-plane.org/home/urf/aviation/gripen/partners.html ) provides a good overview of the suppliers for the old gripen . 
  new gripen is less swedish , with all major parts being foreign . 
  old one had saab radar and volvo license ( from ge ) built engine . 
  new gripen has [ 28 % ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/7d672d32-6bcf-11e3-a216-00144feabdc0 ) british content . 
  `` the navalised gripen , with the same 28 per cent uk content as the standard gripen '' according to ft ( paywall ) . 
  weaponry remains mostly american . 
  santa claus is from the north pole might work .
