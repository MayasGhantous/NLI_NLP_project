lol so the explanation they thought provides them leniency , actually means harsher punishment . 
  i like how your system works , we should adopt that same policy at least in serious cases like this . 
  if you ca n't handle your drink it 's certainly no justification for leniency , although in this case their drinking is quite likely bs . 
  alcohol blackout scenario is totally implausible . 
  if they 've drunk enough alcohol to blackout they 'd have stumbled against the walls and had no motor and communication skills to that kind of concerted act , probably not even hard-on . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/europe_814_colbeck.jpg ) covers more area in the north . 
  besides of [ memorial stone in immola ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kmrkkucbyqq/umkybyiyeni/aaaaaaaaenw/wffezxnvzc8/s1600/img_1645.jpg ) there is at least [ another one ] ( http://users.kymp.net/ilmakilta/kuvat/stukalaatta.jpg ) marking the place where one of the stukas fell down after the mission . 
  some of the pilots of that detachment were still alive 2005 and [ visited in finland . 
  there were some germans like [ kurt kuhlmey ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurt_kuhlmey ) who are still today greatly respected and for a reason . 
  in finland there is long standing tradition to have an `` expert panel '' to guarantee that the finnish nominee would be someone who has no chance for winning . 
  while there might be a public vote for nominees , that `` expert panel '' have the last word and never allow to most popular artist and song to participate to esc . 
  only exception was 2006 because at that year they let their shields down after so many years of losing streak and did n't had expert panel so they could n't squirm out of choosing lordi also they were so out of touch that they did n't believe lordi 's chances . 
  most outrageous example of that conspiracy happened year 2000 when the most popular song according the televote was [ sleepwalker by nightwish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsesfngiopq ) but panel decided to discard that opinion and chose this mediocre , run of the mill , [ totally forgettable song and artist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brgxr-nrmeu ) as finnish participant . 
  without the sabotage of the panel finland has probably won 2000 . 
  that 's not the only example , there are countless other similar cases . 
  that 's why the best and most popular artists of finland do n't even bother to participating in preliminaries anymore . 
  you can usually see only relatively new groups or some old has beens there . 
  reason for the existence of the sabotage panel is the cost of organizing next years competition and that 's why finnish broadcasting company do n't wish to ever win the esc . 
  ^ this scientific arguments that support your proposition are undeniable . 
   getting informed on political issues should be mandatory as well person who does n't understand politics is literally [ ** an idiot ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idiot#etymology ) according the original meaning of that word . 
  on the other hand , he could have said the same of any woman because considering his age it 's highly improbable that he has got erection in this millennium . 
  in other words all women are already `` unfuckable '' for him, 
  it has to be this : [ jean sibelius - finlandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ), 
  if reinheitsgebot dictates that only ingredients are water , barley and hops , how wei\u00dfbier which contains also wheat is possible ? 
  after all it is still called `` bier '' . 
   as a dutch guy i see nothing wrong with this ... as a finnish guy , me neither and i believe that my compatriots do n't have anything against these kind of diplomatic vehicles parked on the sidewalks . 
  i even had exactly the same opinion about using the pillars as locking points . 
  from finland contemporary : * [ jukka poika - \u00c4l\u00e4 tyri nyt , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfzyxn_muwi ) lyrics [ translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/aelae-tyri-nyt-dont-mess-now.html ) * [ paleface - helsinki shangri-la , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgtlu8q8ydg ) lyrics [ translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/helsinki-shangri-la-helsinki-shangri-la.html ) it 's not very good because translator did n't seem to understood all the references and puns . 
  melody of that song is traditional and much older . 
  [ most renown version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhp_9j2cx3m ) of that song is about moonshine making during prohibition era in early 20th century . 
  another well known [ version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa2tyqtlpbi ) has sexually explicit obscene lyrics . 
  btw i digress , but is there similar thing in other countries , alternative profane lyrics for traditional songs or traditional songs with explicit lyrics . 
  i know at least also in sweden there is something similar , johnny bode s\u00e4llskapet . 
  60 's - 80 's * [ irwin goodman - haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6zqqlrweq ) ~ `` fuck you government '' * [ irwin goodman - terveisi\u00e4 perseest\u00e4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooxrn3wtiuq ) ~ `` greetings from my ass '' you parasites of society ... 
  lyrics are against career politicians of all parties * [ kristiina halkola & liisa-maija laaksonen - virsi 439 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuzelne2s8k ) hymn 439 , from old hymnbook . 
  lyrics are about social justice , how poors get their reward at heaven . 
  however it was not the lyrics but arrangement and style how it was performed that put conservatives in to the white hot rage after the controversial tv show . 
  * [ kristiina halkola - poraaja valdemar m\u00e4kinen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuaewq7y8w4 ) miner valdemar m\u00e4kinen , lyrics are about work place safety and poor wages . 
  * [ agit prop - kenen joukoissa seisot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvrlv2glvwo ) `` which troop you stand for , whose banner you carry ... '' war and prewar era * [ silmien v\u00e4lliin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaw2dbwtalq&amp;nohtml5=false ) ~ ( aim and shoot ) ruskies between their eyes * [ me tahdomme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peuzf4jvgao ) far-right nationalists honorary march with color footage of the beauty of prewar finland * [ punakaartilaisten marssi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkgmcux4qli ) `` march of red guard '' from finnish civil war era 1918 * [ taistojen tiell\u00e4 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtlscfjxzxe ) `` at the road of battles '' another march of reds , which became also unofficial song of communist party, 
  i agree , but in finland there is also the chairman of the parliament whose ( somewhat ridiculous ) task is to keep up the appearance and the authority of the parliament by the dress code . 
  they are not allowed to dress how they want even if their voters approved it . 
  finns [ consume ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_milk_consumption_per_capita ) most milk per capita in the world . 
  most popular type in finland is fresh low fat . 
  anecdotal example about the usage of uht i 've heard is keeping a small 2 dl carton as emergency supply for the coffee if normal fresh milk happens to run out . 
  there is this idea that their clothing should reflect the authority of the institution they are chosen to be members . 
  although i believe the dress code has slacken quite lot from what it used to be . 
  obligatory neckties for men were probably discarded already in the 60s by demand of left parties . 
  however i 'm pretty sure that the chairman still demands men wear jackets during session and they are not allowed to be in their shirtsleeves . 
  also in finland there has been some extroverts who have decided to rebel against the dress code of the parliament . 
  [ this ] ( http://cdn.ksml.fi/incoming/rgxob1-508065_.jpg/alternates/free_1140/508065_.jpg ) is former parliament member , rock musician , underground figure [ veltto virtanen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veltto_virtanen ) who declined to give up his beret and got special permission to wear it from the chairman . 
  another similar case was parliament member klaus bremer who insisted that he should be allowed to wear [ shorts ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/978/91c91ed131e043dc9b825121a055ba7b.jpg ) during summer because female parliament members can wear skirts . 
  he also appeared to presidential independence day ball wearing [ this ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/978/883ad1c9f87e4a0faa131b9620b9c4b4.jpg ) kind of costume . 
  while it is considered as a white tie party , also national costume is acceptable option . 
  he is a helsinkian and there is no accepted [ regional national costume ] ( http://www.kansallispuvut.fi/paikkakunnat.htm ) in helsinki . 
  so he suggested his [ street apache ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apache_%28gang%29 ) zoot suit is a `` national costume of s\u00f6rn\u00e4inen '' , area in helsinki reknown of it 's prison and harbor . 
  in old finnish movies there are actually [ scenes ] ( https://youtu.be/yljeykgenxi?t=54 ) to defend his position . 
  after it was revealed that the culprit for [ belgacom attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_socialist ) was gchq , the relationship with supposed ally probably chilled some amount . 
  it is understandable that belgian security officials might not be willing to share any more information than they see absolutely necessary and what they were obligated to do . 
  in finland we have [ news in classical latin ] ( http://areena.yle.fi/1-1931339 ) in tax paid public radio channel , should i get worried that romans or catholics try to invade ? 
  exactly . 
  like are they not aware of these other incidents or how do they decided that tuusula was terrorist attack but not kauhajoki . 
  does n't make sense . 
  too close , my suggestion is [ kerguelen aka desolation islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerguelen_islands ) it has even proper name for that purpose . 
  that list lacks myyrmanni , includes tuusula but not kauhajoki . 
  then there are some incidents without proper description . 
  some incidents like [ this ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/pommi-autossa-pasilan-asemalla-kaksi-vuotta-vankeutta/4425660 ) might have included but are not in the list . 
  those czech whips resemble finnish [ `` vappuhuiska '' ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_etypxyifjwi/s9vvl316wzi/aaaaaaaab5g/9pogdd_hemg/s640/img_4422.jpg ) . 
  if they look like they are doing something that is not allowed they get punished . 
  in those conditions even small things like normal prison food vs gruel becomes important . 
  if they know that there is an alternative the small variety of normal food that breaks monotonous routine if they just stop praying it probably soon comes tempting . 
  actually that 's something probably should n't be allowed . 
  they 've done something that 's separates them from the rest of humankind and some of the rights that belong human beings do n't concern them anymore . 
  because they are going to spend rest of their days in a cell there is no need for any rehabilitation and self-development including studying , physical exercise and practicing religion . 
  i do n't see any redeeming quality of allowing them practice their religion and if they believe they will go to hell because of that instead of their crimes , it 's just better . 
  even the solace of religion should be denied from them at least until they convincingly show remorse of their crimes . 
   who exactly ? 
  how about financiers of the terrorists ? 
  bin laden was n't the only one , there are more of his ilk in saudi-arabia and gulf countries . 
  closing their western bank accounts and confiscating their properties in europe could be the first step . 
  hunting them down like bin laden would be the next . 
  final goal should be making those countries abandon wahhabism and move on to more progressive and moderate form of islam . 
  one milestone to that is making them stop to finance of building mosques in western countries and sending radical imams who preach against our values spoiling the work our governments are trying to do to integrate immigrants . 
  exactly , you can execute a person only once and then it 's over . 
  locking them up and slowly destroying their mental health and killing their will of life in a punishment that rests literally rest of their life should satisfy even most bloodthirsty proponent of death penalty . 
   has the continent been suffering in some way without bison ? 
  at first probably not so much because domestic cattle fulfilled the ecological niche left empty by bison and auroch . 
  however later on when cattle was moved to cowsheds and fed with hay grown for that purpose , the natural meadows started to disappear because of the lack of large grazing herbivores who kept them clear of trees . 
  meadowlands as a biotope support wide array of wild flowers , are home of bees and butterflies and most importantly , the source of wonderfully delicious wild strawberries . 
  however in finnish there is also [ * `` toki '' * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toki#finnish ) , which could be used exactly like german or dutch [ * `` doch '' * , ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doch ) and for some reason there is no similar sounding swedish or even estonian equivalent word like it has come straight to german in finnish . 
  in finland , the narrowest street ( 213 cm ) in the whole country , which is located in rauma is called [ * kitukr\u00e4nni * ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kitukr%c3%a4nn ) meaning something like ~ `` ailing alley '' . 
  there is also alternative theory that name comes from swedish word * ` skit ' * which means shit . 
  another also narrow ( 299 cm ) alley in kristiinankaupunki is called [ * kissanpiiskaajankuja * ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kissanpiiskaajankuja ) ~ `` cat spanker alley '' . 
  that name in old seafaring town comes from [ cat o ' nine tails ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat_o'_nine_tails ) and does n't mean actual cats . 
  historical example of probably greatest mistrust ever is the [ copper currency of sweden . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_copper_currency_in_sweden ) trying to hide a pile of [ these babies ] ( http://nukunskap.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/img_0961-e1439974662763-770x484.jpg ) or better yet escape with that pile from tax collectors was not an easy tax, 
  tower dumps , they sort out those who not fit to profile and have list of suspicious phone numbers and imeis . 
  behaviour like turning phone on only a short time might make it more suspicious . 
  large pizza order from the phone that 's was previously closed , on the list of used by possible suspects and to the apartment that 's supposed to be empty probably gave them a first clue . 
  it 's not that they lie about pizza order but omit some other important details . 
  in a dense populated area where there are many towers they can also triangulate the location of the suspicious phone by the signal strength extremely accurate .
