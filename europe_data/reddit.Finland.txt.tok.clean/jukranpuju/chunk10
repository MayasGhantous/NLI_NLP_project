  ironically if she had been a soldier or a legal fighter then killing enemy soldiers in a battle would n't have been even a crime . 
  now i do n't know what is the punishment for murder in iraq or if there are some mitigating factors like her mental capacity as a minor . 
  then again in principle i 'm against capital punishment , not because i think it 's too harsh but on the contrary i think that the guilty ones get too easy if they do n't have to atone their crimes and regret what they have done . 
  if she will be found guilty , then a few decades or even a life sentence in iraqi prison wasting her youth and adulthood is much more appropriate punishment than just executing her . 
  are these colors really so crazy ?

  perhaps also other countries , at least those located in geologically inactive areas , should resort similar solutions as we do with [ onkalo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository ) and build their own spent nuclear fuel repositories . 
  i agree , but different people and different circumstances . 
  distances between stations are long , thefts are rare and bomb attacks something that only happen in foreign countries . 
  i have to admit that the last sign leaves room for many interpretations . 
  `` no fedoras ? '', 
  i 'm not sure but probably no because it would encourage people staying there , instead of leaving those items by their seat where they 'll return after their patronage . 
  purpose of those signs is to increase customer turnover . 
  the idea is probably to increase customer turnover so that people would not come to that car and occupy a table all their journey until they arrive their destination , but return their seats after having coffee , meal , snacks etc. 
  in a train cafeteria/restaurant car , they do n't want that people come there with their outdoor cloths on and carrying luggage . 
  something like a narrow gauge pit railway in a salt mine , deep underground . 
  not even connected with railroad systems above used for transporting passengers . 
  turkey got off `` the democracy train '' at the wrong station and took the other train to the opposite direction , so they are even further where they started . 
  finnish symbol is pretty good . 
  however i do n't get the estonian symbol . 
  stylistically drawn picture of estonia 's national bird , [ barn swallow ] ( http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-88-34/6138.swallow.jpg ) as a cutout from circle might have been something more identifiable . 
  sounds a bit like a variation of zenos 's paradox of [ achilles and the tortoise . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeno%27s_paradoxes#achilles_and_the_tortoise ), 
  i would say that they are part of the culture , because as a classic their ingredients are `` locked down '' . 
  any attempt of improvising with them , would certainly cause complaining . 
  now , i do n't know if we got that recipe from estonia which is entirely possible . 
  there are some details like form baked bread which i believe is more typical in estonia than in finland . 
  however during [ seprakauppa ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/seprakauppa ) trading our main bartering article was fish . 
  similar sandwiches are also popular in finland . 
  main difference is that instead of chives or spring onions we use dill as main garnish and the fish is seasoned and marinated with brine . 
  here they are usually called as [ * muna anjovisleip\u00e4 * , ] ( http://yllapito.maku.fi/sites/maku/files/user/19533/2015/11/img_0842.jpg ) though the fish is not the real anchovy but the same sprat you use . 
  our name for that fish is [ * kilohaili * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kilohaili ) or [ * haili * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/haili ) when it 's sold fresh instead of prepared . 
  are n't [ these ] ( https://www.alltube.fi/image/cache/data/kaikki/abb980-500x500.jpg ) bidet showers nowadays almost as ubiquitous also in estonia as they are in finland ? 
  those bidet basins were fashionable in finland during 60 's and 70 's , but almost completely disappeared later . 
  if people have larger bathrooms they more likely use that room for small sauna or washing machine . 
  both , it 's the average price of all available properties . 
   that bear is a real asshole , to take a man 's bag . 
  however according the [ finnish folk traditions ] ( http://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/art2374308 ) the best weapon a woman has against bears is mooning . 
  raising a skirt to her ears and reveling her posterior and privates is a guaranteed method for a woman to drive off a bear . 
  it 's not always `` fucking dark '' , at this time of the year sun does n't even set until it 's closer to midnight in the southern part of norway . 
  in the northern part of norway the last sunset was in may and the next one will come in august . 
   statistics started to exclude foreigners ( read : finns ) buying alcohol in our shops and that might be the reason we are not even on the list \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  vaasa used to market itself as `` the sunniest place of finland '' based on the weather statistics . 
  actual touristic seaside resorts are the [ nallikari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nallikari ) beach , which gets lot of tourists during summers from northern part of norway , the dune areas of [ kalajoki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalajoki#tourism ) and [ yyteri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yyteri ) beach in pori . 
  almost the whole of our coast area belongs to that zone and the sunniest place of finland is the city of vaasa . 
  mountain range in norway and sweden cover us effectively from the most drastic weather changes from north atlantic when norwegians got the most of the rain . 
  [ sea breeze - land breeze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sea_breeze ) cycle do n't bring as much clouds , but more often blows them away , especially if the prevailing winds are from the sea south/south-west bringing warm weather . 
  we have basically the same idiom also in finnish : * `` kiert\u00e4\u00e4 kuin kissa kuumaa puuroa '' * . 
  only difference is that in our version there is a cat who circles round the hot porridge . 
  [ heck cattle , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heck_cattle ) the aurochs !, 
  that same shared tune with [ finnish national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkrvd5i44ko ) and [ livonian national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw0h29thxnw ) is actually the most important reason why we as finns should keep that song instead of changing it to [ finlandia . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mjrsaorc7g ), 
  from that article :  with no evidence more compelling than a receipt from a chemist to show they have bought some local carminative ( ** a drug that reduces flatulence ** ) that maybe a bit exaggeration , but if that 's true they award people with insurance money who get gas from fizzy drinks or others with lactose intolerance , the one 's who should n't eat e.g. 
  ice cream in any case , instead of just those who have real food poisoning . 
  it 's like [ * lihapiirakka * , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lihapiirakka ) but instead of minced meat , it 's filled with sausages . 
  i know that chinese yuan and hong kong dollar , also macau pataca were about tenth of euro and yuan is little bit more at the moment . 
  however if we speak about the purchasing power then buying locally produced things or services in china , everything is so much cheaper that the number in price tag could be the same as in europe . 
  those things cost only tenth what they would cost in europe . 
  hong kong and macau are only marginally cheaper than europe . 
  so did i , but that does n't seem to be anymore and maybe it even ever was n't . 
  interestingly they do n't seem to have any common policy but different officials can do what they want . 
  there are several . 
  all the names except passport are recognizable as fake : * passport : [ maria olivia virtanen ] ( http://www.lentoposti.fi/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.downloaditem&amp;g2_itemid=27307&amp;g2_gallerysid=5ce3432fe102ed8f13978463ce4aac00 ) * identity card : [ matti matkailija ] ( https://www.passikuvat.fi/_assets/media/virallinen-henkilokortti.jpg ) * police badge : [ malli markku mallikorttilainen ] ( http://www.poliisi.fi/instancedata/prime_product_julkaisu/intermin/embeds/poliisiwwwstructure/8577861305d3e2caa6ac62c5989d7d85981be3fe.jpg ) * certificate of competency : [ maija mallikas ] ( https://www.trafi.fi/filebank/a/1386932503/63a0b8582e4c93a8c70aaf897b7695fc/13808-patevyyskirja_malli.jpg ) * driving licence : [ meri anna aurora autoilija ] ( https://www.poliisi.fi/instancedata/prime_product_julkaisu/intermin/embeds/poliisiwwwstructure/45f3d3d8506ff187893ba99f248b20bb9a6f85b1.jpg ) * residence permit : [ anna kristiina asuja ] ( http://www.migri.fi/download/d093ad6983fe076131cdad6b6382215cfed6acf9.jpg ), 
  british tourist r/floridaman of europe . 
  ... and if one happens to speak [ middle dutch , ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/helle#middle_dutch ) then it 's literally hell . 
  just a one degree more , +25 \u00b0 c and it would be literally [ ** ` helle ' ** ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/helle#finnish ) as we call it in finland . 
  but still those products are meant for human consumption , however there are many cosmetic products with similar designations : cream , milk and butter , which are meant applied only externally . 
  not that i see any risk for mixing either of those products with the real thing , but the consequences of digesting sun milk or cold cream are still probably more serious than if one drinks accidentally soy milk . 
  consider it this way , when you are in the foreign country everywhere you go quite likely there is somebody who has some clue what you are speaking , but they always have a choice to reply or claim that they do n't understand . 
  however you do n't have that choice when they speak english . 
  the level of communication ca n't rise higher than the lowest common denominator . 
  so although you speak perfect english you ca n't effectively communicate with more complex vocabulary than they have and will be reduced at their level . 
  in a one on one situation you might manage with just english , but as soon as there is larger party the discussion sooner or later moves to the local language . 
  there might be some local who tries to translate to you but at the end , you only get a gist what has been spoken . 
  in an emergency situation all the announcements and other critical information are most likely only in local language . 
  without that life saving information you are at the mercy of locals who may or may not have time to translate to you . 
   christian term actually that word [ `` amok '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/running_amok#malay.2findonesian_origin ) comes malay/indonesian languages , originating from the area where the main religion is islam , although it 's roots are probably in the earlier animistic beliefs . 
  could it be that if they did n't had the exact location where in greenland that someone was born , they just put it in the middle although there are hundreds of kilometers to nearest human habitat from that location ? 
  finnish series [ `` bordertown '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bordertown_\\ ( finnish_tv_series \\ ) ) , [ imdb link ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4937942/ ) was pretty decent and it 's available also in netflix, 
  as a lifting gas of an airship or a balloon that amount of helium could lift about 4 metric tons ( 1.114 kg/m3 ) . 
  * here , i fixed the most obvious mistakes of google translate : * 9th graders ' whimsy : they built an entire hot tub in school - they even made heater konsta valkama and nico rajala did not content themselves with making just a sauna scoop in technical work lessons , but built up a hot tub . 
  the school teacher markus boedeker has not previously been involved in a similar project . 
  nico rajala 's and konsta valkama 's hot tub is almost ready . 
  only benches are lacking , but they are due to be completed in the next two weeks . 
  sami suojanen aamulehti , kangasala in the yard of private home in kangasala , there is a shining new hot tub . 
  it 's not just any average tub , but a unique handicraft . 
  tub is a sample of skills of 17 year old konsta valkama and a 16 year old nico rajala . 
  - i got the idea for building tub at school in the autumn of my ninth grade , says konta valkama , a primus motor of tub project . 
  from that whim started the half year project during which valkama and rajala built a hot tub and a wood stove . 
  - the stove has been tested . 
  water circulates and heats water , but we have not bathed yet because the benches are still missing from the tub . 
  next , we are going to fetch timber for them . 
  the first festive bath is coming in couple of weeks at the valkama family 's cottage in per\u00e4sein\u00e4joki . 
  markus boedeker , a teacher of technical work of young men , from takahuhti 's school in tampere , says he did not agree for them making a hot tub when they suggested it the first time . 
  - the tub is an exceptionally big project for comprehensive school technical work lessons . 
  i have been a teacher for 23 years , and have n't previously received any such large work proposal , boedeker says . 
  gradually , however , the teacher 's mind changed . 
  - konsta was very confident and resolute . 
  he had a clear vision of what to do and how . 
  he is a skilled and accomplished guy , so i finally dared to give permission to start work .
