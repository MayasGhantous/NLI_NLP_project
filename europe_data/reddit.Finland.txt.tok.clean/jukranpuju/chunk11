  one key factor for the teacher 's consent was that the inside of the tub was laminated . 
  - the school does not have the tools and methods to make a waterproof tub of just wood . 
  tub frame is made of a spruce board . 
  the inner layer is glass fiber to ensure waterproofness . 
  the young men found plans and drawings from the web and modified them suitable for use as their own version . 
  the volume of the tub is 1.7-2 .0 cubic meters depending on how much water is filled . 
  the barrel has an inside diameter of 1.6 meters and a height of 1.1 meters . 
  let young men tell you more . 
  - the outer shell is made of a ten-millimeter spruce planks . 
  the inside is fiberglass . 
  the resin consumption was about 20 kilos and the glass fiber mat needed about 10 square meters . 
  the surface is painted with the gelcoat . 
  valkama adds that the diameter of the barrel is so large that the corner of the planks are not sawn in an angle for the circle . 
  - planks touch each others at the inside edges and there is a small gap of 1-2 millimeters in the outside , but it does not matter . 
  when standing next to a barrel , everything sounds so easy . 
  it should be noted however , that in upper secondary schools usually there are no properly ventilated workspace required for fiberglass works . 
  neither there is one at takahuhti school . 
  - for the fiberglass work , the tub had to be always carried out . 
  repeated outcarrying was one of the most demanding stages in the project , rajala says . 
  - i have some previous experience with fiberglass works with moped quadricycles . 
  i was n't anymore a a total novice of fibering , but for example weather made project more difficult . 
  during the fibering one must work relatively quick . 
  there is also a burning stove in the handiwork of these young talents . 
  when i first heard about this project of 9th graders , i imagined the young men built just a tub and bought the stove ready from store . 
  not at all , valkama and rajala also made a fireplace for heating the water . 
  their handiwork include the actual stove , grate and fireplace hatches . 
  - the stove is made of 1 mm sheet metal . 
  it is welded and has a 60 liter water tank . 
  water circulates according the laws of physics . 
  welding is done by mig-welding . 
  if there has been a tig-equipment in the school , the outcome would have been much better . 
  the walls are made by welding a millimeter-thick sheet . 
  it has a 60-liter water tank for heating the water . 
  long chimney is still missing from the stove . 
  duo intends to buy that from a store . 
  during the half-year , building a tub demanded all lessons of technical work , which is two hours per week . 
  in addition , young men utilized lessons of other subjects during the spring to complete the work . 
  valkama 's father hannu , has contributed to the cost of the tub by paying timber and fiberglass supplies because material consumption has been considerably higher than in the school 's average student work . 
  - the material cost have gone from 300 to 500 euros . 
  the sum may be closer to that 500 's , young tub makers calculate . 
  the fast search engine look-up from the web shows that the ready-made wood-heated hot tub prices are under and over 2000 euros . 
  can not help but salute konsta valkama and nico rajala . 
  just reaching to the end in such a project is a mighty achievement . 
  also the level of finishing of the job looks good . 
  in the honor of the teacher markus boedeker , it is worth calculating that he has given permission to build a tub . 
  breaking boundaries in this case was good . 
  valkama got full 10 for subject , but rajala 's number remained in 7 . 
  these handy boys have been schoolmates since the fourth grade of the elementary school . 
  compulsory education is now behind , but it does not necessarily break their shared journey . 
  - we have applied for a bachelor 's degree in automotive at tredu nekala 's department . 
  we do n't now the outcome of our applications yet . 
  however , it is certain that the building will continue . 
  in the garage of grandparents ' in kangasala there are good facilities for self-realization . 
  - next i tune my moped quadricycle . 
  no other bigger projects are now pending , valkama says . 
  the tuning and repairing of a moped car is a familiar thing for konsta , we even found him under his moped qudricycle when we went to see the hot tub . 
  - the fuel pipe was out of the bracket , nothing more serious than that . 
  they do n't tell the exact numbers in that article . 
  for a comparison , i 'd like to know what are those countries whose numbers are right next above and below texas ? 
  originally it was * `` der er ulve i mosen '' * , which means `` there are wolfs in the swamp '' , which makes somewhat better sense . 
  in finnish we have somewhat similar meaning expressions about a thing or a situation where * `` there is a dog buried '' * or somebody who has * `` a tail of a fox under his arm '' * - he 's cheating or making a joke at someone 's expense . 
  some other finnish expressions : * * he does n't know anything but what trickles down from his nose to his mouth and not even the name of it . 
  * * * `` exciting '' , said granny when she changed to the new coffee brand . 
  * * * rations of a stupid man will get eaten first . 
  * * * do n't worry , sit down on a tuft and we make some coffee , then we 'll find your knit cap . 
  they play [ jalgpall . 
  i would have expected belgium 's position to correlate geographically with neighboring countries france and netherlands in a similar manner like sweden , finland and estonia , but somehow they are weird anomaly . 
  why belgium is that high in the list ? 
  because jolla 's [ sailfish os ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sailfish_os#using_android_software_running_on_sailfish_os ) is also linux like android  in addition to its native applications , ** sailfish can run most android applications ** . 
  if you 're interested about jolla , you should check r/jolla for more information . 
   but roy also notes some positive news : hundreds of foreign fighters from europe are seeking a safe return to europe by turning themselves in to their embassies in turkey , according to the italian press . 
   `` this means they do n't have the suicidal instincts characterizing terrorists like abedi , '' roy says how he could be so sure about that , like could it be possible that they still have suicidal instincts and instead of middle east , they urge to fulfill their instincts in europe . 
  or maybe for a short while they are momentarily free of those instincts when they are returning , but later on those instincts rise again . 
  i do n't agree that the returning of the people who have large number of such who have committed atrocities among them is really a good news ? 
  and [ colorado , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_petersburg,_colorado ) and [ pennsylvania , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._petersburg,_pennsylvania ) then again neither the coordinates of those places correspond with oslo . 
  however petersburg ( without `` saint '' ) in [ alaska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petersburg,_alaska ) is a bit nearer , about 341 km further south than oslo . 
  also romania has [ plastic polymer banknotes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banknotes_of_the_romanian_leu#banknotes_of_the_fourth_leu_.28ron.29 ) instead of paper . 
  in china 1 yuan banknote makes sense , because considering the prices there it 's value is more than 15 cents . 
  however i do n't hate coins , and i actually prefer to have bi-metal 1 $ and 2 $ coins than a crumpled fiver . 
  i have nothing against crisp new bills , larger denomination the better  , but i do n't like small dirty crumpled fivers . 
  small denomination bills see much more use than the larger ones , so they will get dirty and crumpled pretty fast . 
  i 'd rather have coins in the bottom of my pocket than crumpled small bills in my wallet . 
  the value of 5 $ bill is not the same anymore as it was 2002 because of inflation , so sooner or later we quite likely have 5 $ coin . 
  now , why should we have 1 $ bills , i would go as far as rather have ** 5 $ coins ** instead of bills like nowadays . 
  it would be good if the booze really affected like that but in fact it 's totally opposite . 
  without booze we 'd probably need even less police than what we have . 
  according the statistics in about 80 % of homicides and 70 % of other violent crimes in finland the perpetrator was drunk , if they 've been sober most of those probably have n't happened . 
  i could n't find the statistics , but i 'm pretty sure that the numbers in thefts have similar pattern . 
   not necessarily use lithium ... 
  it seems quite likely that [ next generation batteries ] ( https://news.utexas.edu/2017/02/28/goodenough-introduces-new-battery-technology ) do n't use lithium , but sodium or potassium ( go kazakhstan , other countries have inferior potassium ) . 
  it 's more of a principle that one does n't exercise just for the sake of exercising but there should be a some real purpose and benefit behind it . 
  using stairs instead of elevator is actually not so good example , like where is the benefit . 
  commuting with bike or foot instead of car or public transport are better , because one saves the price of gas or bus tickets . 
  berry picking , gardening or wood chopping are good examples . 
  same idea could be found also in karate kid 's [ `` wax on , wax off '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fulnur0rvec ) scene . 
  however , we finns would have quite likely provided generous financial support for any organization who claims to be representing livonians in latvia like we did in interbellum years of world wars . 
  we 'd probably do it even today . 
   finland was 50 to 80 years ahead of estonia so pretty much those lost years were 1940 - 1990 .
