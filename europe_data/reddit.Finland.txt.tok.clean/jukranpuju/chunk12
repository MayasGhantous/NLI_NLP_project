  width of the pallets comes from the standardized [ width of railroad cars . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eur-pallet ) however finland has wider [ 5ft ( 1524 mm ) rail gauge , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_ft_and_1520_mm_gauge_railways#technical ) thus the wider pallets . 
  so , no wonder why a person who yearns back to those bad old times also steals something that was coveted back then . 
  although he looks hardly old enough to remember those days . 
  iirc those kind products were exactly something that were hard to get during soviet times and people queued them for hours if there is a rumor that a shipment has arrived to a shop . 
  that answer is probably a case of materialized staircase wit . 
  like it 's a question , he was asked so many times , he had time to think and create a perfect answer . 
  when it happened first time , his answer might have been something different . 
  another similar laconic one-word quip is also his answer `` practice '' for a question how he became so good shot . 
  that site i linked has different criteria with minors ( overweight ) than it has with adults ( obese ) . 
  however those numbers of the girls might predict worrisome future . 
  korean film archive have an excellent [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/koreanfilm/videos ) with more than hundred older korean movies with english subtitles . 
  swedes used to be slimmer than average europeans . 
  now it seems that [ especially girls ] ( http://www.worldobesity.org/resources/world-map-obesity/?map=overview-girls ) there are getting weight . 
  [ fine estonian documentary , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8ocuy6lsdw ) which explains how estonians became the [ most proficient in english language ] ( http://estonianworld.com/business/estonia-ranks-seventh-in-english-proficiency-index/ ) of all the countries that used to belong in soviet union or warsaw pact . 
  same reason also applies to finnish language , which is easy to learn for estonians because of linguistic relation . 
  i would absolutely consider mondrian 's squares as art and even an object of beauty , especially when combined with the same era de stilj [ architecture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/rietveldschroederhuis.jpg ) and [ furniture design . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/rietveld_chair_1.jpg ) there are even more drastic examples of that kind of art , i must admit i have some difficulties to understand , like malevich 's [ `` black square '' . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/malevich.black-square.jpg ) however i 'd rather consider art as something that speaks onlooker and conveys an emotion . 
  limiting it just for aspiration of beauty and demonstration of the skill of it 's creator , leaves too much out of the definition . 
  we are , breaking someone 's bottle while it still contains alcohol is one of the main cause of stabbings , right next to jumping the queue of nightly sausage kiosks . 
  when i was in army training for [ m72 law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m72_law ) happened with training device , which was loaded with some kind of small fireworks rocket . 
  at the end , the best was allowed to shoot a real thing . 
  with [ 55 s 55 , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_s_55 ) there was a training device which used rifle barrel and cartridges , but there was also rocket-propelled training grenades which were exactly same size as the real fragmentation grenades and everyone was allowed to shoot one of those . 
  then again i was in infantry company and troops in anti-tank company certainly were allowed to use more real material . 
  after all somebody has already made swiss cheese the old tank we used as target . 
  clubbing seal puppies is not necessary and could be totally avoided . 
  however their dreams are more like an elk that has caused horrible traffic accident , wounded and must be given coup de gr\u00e2ce . 
  it must be [ her , ] ( https://fi-seiska-cdn-prod.seiska.fi/files/styles/gallery_image/s3/styles/web/galleries/2016/07/29/tuksu_990_synttarit.jpg?itok=qvqrxjfp ) i ca n't think anyone else who deserves that title better than [ `` tuksu '' . 
  less obvious answer to the victorious parties are russia and china , who would win the most in a such improbable attempt . 
  also us occupation would n't succeed because one prerequisite for a smaller population ( 330 mil ) to occupy a larger population ( 510 mil ) is huge technological disparity , which does n't exist . 
  at least among [ finnish tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_tatars ) it happens and it might even be relatively common . 
  not having execution as an option lowers the burden of proof . 
  let 's say that we have two killings one more garden variety case and another truly heinous . 
  the garden variety one is a closed case , but in the heinous one there is a tiny minuscule possibility for innocence while not even enough for reasonable doubt . 
  in a good conscience i could see both cases sentenced for life , because it would mean that if the judgement was wrong it could be still revoked . 
  however capital punishment in one or both of those cases seems to be unfair . 
  we executed the stupid one and let the more clever monster walk or when later we have new evidence that prove we executed an innocent person . 
  i agree , but i think that back then their situation was the main reason why the west was n't doing so well . 
  rebuilding costs in the east affected possibilities for building new infrastructure in the west , competition of limited resources , solidarity tax and so on . 
  now when everything is balanced just a little bit more evenly , that impact although not yet disappeared , does n't hamper progress in the same way or at least it 's effects are slowly diminishing . 
  i would think that 20 years ago germany was still struggling with reunification process which drain them huge amount of money . 
  before that , there was only west germany to compete . 
  now when there is n't anymore such a demand of money to the east , they are pretty much unbeatable for any other european country . 
  seven not eurozone countries are obliged to join eurozone when they meet convergence criteria , which leaves out only denmark and brexiting uk and then i conveniently forgot the non eu countries . 
  because this is askeurope , i though that question mostly from the european point of view . 
  euro has made that question somewhat obsolete . 
  however from our earlier money [ the 90 's coins ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/finnischemuenzen.jpg/500px-finnischemuenzen.jpg ) were pretty nice . 
  also [ kven language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kven_language ) has official minority language status in norway since 2005 . 
  in finland there is conscription so i have trained more extensively with an assault rifle [ rk-62 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rk_62 ) and during my serve or reservist trainings also shot with light machine gun [ kk 62 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kk_62 ) , pistol [ fn browning hi-power , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/browning_hi-power ) sniper rifle [ tkiv 85 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62_tkiv_85 ) , military pump action shotgun , [ m72 law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m72_law ) , [ 55 s 55 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_s_55 ) and probably the most exotic weapon was some [ infantry light field cannon ] ( http://www.jaegerplatoon.net/artillery3.htm ) a relic from wwii era , i ca n't remember the exact type any more . 
  in civilian life i have tested [ svt-40 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svt-40 ) , remington semi-automatic shotgun , [ 44 mag . 
  thompson contender ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thompson/center_contender ) and .22 , .38 , 357 mag . 
  sw revolvers . 
  although finland is usually considered one of the least corrupt countries , the cronyism still sometimes rears it 's ugly head . 
  politicians and officials arrange deals for their buddies by tailoring terms of procurements and contracts , so that an outsider could not win in an already fixed competition . 
  also nepotism exist although being more easily proven it 's not so common than cronyism . 
  still it 's quite common to learn that a descendant or a relative of an important politician has a well paid , easy job with a suspiciously odd title in some large corporation which does contracts for government . 
  like they can hire anyone , but is it absolutely certain that they need someone for that kind of ballast job while at the same time they fire people . 
  in finnish : these are older , some even little bit quaint `` kullanmuru '' ~ ` crumb of gold ' `` syd\u00e4nk\u00e4py '' ~ ' ( pine ) cone of heart ' `` mielitietty '' ~ ` favored one ' these are newer : `` h\u00f6p\u00f6nassu '' ~ ` funny face ' `` hunajapupu '' ~ ` honey bunny ', 
   the thought that we 'll have to go through another cold and dark winter soon , drives me insane since i do n't even feel that we have had any summer yet . 
  it 's the same for me , in autumn i usually get [ `` fernweh '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fernweh#german ) or `` kaukokaipuu '' like we say in finland . 
  i have some friends who have managed to organize their life so that they could spend their winters or at least several months in somewhere in the south and i envy them . 
  most common such places for finns are thailand , spain and lately also malta . 
  then it 's `` yet another false friend '' between finnish and estonian . 
  it 's entirely possible to legally own guns if one meets certain criteria : no convictions of violent crimes or drugs , mentally stable , has practiced the use of a firearm , has appropriate storage place for the gun and has legal purpose for owning the gun . 
  legal purposes for owning a gun are hunting , sports shooting , gun collecting and maintaining shooting skills as a reservist . 
  only in exceptionally rare cases one could get a license for firearm in self defense purposes , something like that usually requires specialized security profession . 
  it 's practically impossible for an average citizen to own certain small , small caliber pistols and snubnosed revolvers . 
  however getting a larger , more powerful military style semi-auto is easier because for owning that kind of gun , there are many legitimate purposes . 
  the law recognizes legitimate self-protecting situations when using a gun or in fact any weapon is legal . 
  still when the gun license is for other purposes , it means that one is not allowed to carry the gun around in case a self defense situation might occur . 
  i must say that the lack of guns in public spaces and from the hands of untrained people makes me feel safer than if everybody was armed all the time . 
  and i state this as a citizen of a country with universal conscription where most men have trained to use for a firearm . 
  our climate in finland is relatively mild considering the latitude . 
  also when measured annually there are no discrepancies with the length of days and nights , but they are exactly the same all over the world , 4380 hours daylight and nighttime , except the leap year . 
  however here those days with most daylight concentrate in summer . 
  negotiate certainly , but it depends of their demands if they should bend on them . 
  afterwards if they 'd agreed to demands and when hostages were freed they should already have a plan how to retaliate , preferably by terminating the hostage taker terrorists with extreme prejudice . 
  also if there were some `` neutral '' party to initiate the negotiations , henceforward consider it as a hostile who deserves the same treatment as the terrorists . 
  i agree, 
  i admit that while in theory it could be any kind of enthusiastic discussion , at least in finland it 's pretty much an euphemism of drinking with friends . 
  if somebody tells that he spend last night for `` improving the world '' there is no room for any ambiguity . 
  i assume it 's pretty much same in estonia or is n't it ? 
  in finnish we have resembling concept of * `` maailmanparantaminen '' * ~ ` improving the world ' . 
  that 's kind of opposite of [ * `` kalsarik\u00e4nnit '' * , ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kalsarik%c3%a4nnit ) which means drinking at home wearing just underpants . 
  when one goes to pub to drink and discuss things with the friends , it 's common to refer it as `` improving the world '' ignoring the drinking part . 
  fine example of these improvement ideas is depicted in [ this traditional drinking song , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igpif0fm7yo ) where they want to turn all the lakes of finland to booze . 
  women could drink whatever they want . 
  for the men there might be some rules , not so much for the drink itself but how it looks . 
  like if some man happens to like the taste of some fantasy cocktail , he still might want to get his drink in somewhat less decorated version than if the same drink was made for woman , no sparklers , paper umbrellas and convoluted drinking straws . 
  we have [ this  ( http://kari.kotiseutuarkisto.fi/helkajuh.htm )  ritvala helka festival  `` the world will end when helka of ritvala is no longer '' says an old finnish proverb about a remarkable popular tradition in finland , the whitsuntide feast at ritvala in the parish of s\u00e4\u00e4ksm\u00e4ki ( now a part of the city of valkeakoski ) . 
  on whitsunday the maidens of the village , in national costume , gather at the crossroads from which , singing ancient helka songs , they first wander a short way down each road and return to the starting point . 
  finally they move off in procession towards helkavuori ( `` helka hill '' ) . 
  this makes a cruciform figure of the route they walk . 
  on helkavuori the girls make a circle and finish the song they were singing on arrival . 
  the old belief that the fields of ritvala would stop growing if the villagers ceased the practice obviously accounts for the fact that the traditional rituals have been maintained up to our day , and the mediaeval fieldblessing processions of the catholic church have been recalled in this connection . 
  according to other scholars , again , the helka feast is connected with pagan sacrifices and fertility rites . 
  the helka feast shows superimposed rites which have been added in the course of times . 
  after the procession , there is an open-air feast which conformes faithfully to old finnish tradition with folk dances , folk songs and instrumental folk music . 
  on helkavuori , the site where the whitsun fires used to burn , there is now a youth society building ( 1919 ) , and this society ritvalan nuorisoseura has for more than 90 years , since its beginnings , been responsible for all the arrangements .
