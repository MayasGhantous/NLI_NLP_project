  [ some video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uhv_mbvn5c ), 
  almost everything applies also to finland . 
  things that do n't apply are the changing swimwear in public beach and their open-air showers . 
  using towel as a loincloth to hide crotch area when changing and having swimwear on in showers are the more acceptable behavior . 
  also practically all the finnish children have already seen both of their parents naked in saunas , so being seen by kids is not so much for consideration as the adults who may take offense . 
  private lakeside summer cottages with saunas are considered kind of `` nudist areas '' and swimming naked between sauna sessions is the rule . 
  then again public non-sexual nakedness even in other places is not so big thing . 
  if one does n't wank or do helicopter with his dick , the flashing incident with police at present does n't necessarily lead to the fines . 
  we have a concept of [ `` onnenpotku '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/onnenpotku ) ~ lit . 
  kick of luck . 
  unexpected success is called `` onnenpotku '' and actually one is supposed to react all success like it came unexpected and never brag about it . 
  there is also a gesture , `` kick of luck '' for wishing success , which is performed by kicking gently with knee or even foot to someone 's bum . 
  it could be done by a close friend or relative before something like a critical school test or a job interview etc. 
  finnish traditional cause for a toast , when nobody ca n't think anything better anymore is : * `` sille ettei sika meit\u00e4 pienen\u00e4 sy\u00f6nyt '' * ~ `` to the fact that pig did n't eat us when we 're little . '', 
  by studying the geography of portugal from the map , it 's quite easy to understand why the location of lisbon is unique . 
  there are no other similar waterway like river tajo and it 's estuary , which provides safe harbor with possibilities to transport wares with barges from inland to coast and back . 
  even with the infrastructure completely destroyed that location has such properties that the city will be certainly rebuild . 
  v\u00e4rttin\u00e4 : * [ matalii ja mustii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afbkiazoyk0 ) - that was in some american ( ? ),

   i 've heard they 're not entirely accurate the marriage rates , which in many european countries are lower than in us , affect to the divorce rates . 
  many couples , especially those who have no children just [ co-habit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohabitation#europe ) without bothering to getting married . 
  moving separate from co-habitation relationship does n't show in divorce statistics . 
  helsinki : * [ leevi and the leavings - jos helsinki on kaunis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuwibhb1i4s ) * [ haloo helsinki !,

  lol , actually in the beginning of that song there is a mention about his unemployment and that they go to tallinn to spend their dole moneys . 
  so he might be so poor that he ca n't afford to visit tallinn as often as he likes ( or perhaps as you suggested , have money for that kind of `` business scenarios '' in a long term without becoming a rock star ) . 
  tallinn : * [ miljoonasade - ik\u00e4v\u00e4ni tallinnaan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jadz77-k4fs ) , finnish song about a guy who falls in love with an estonian girl and starts a band to get money for his visits to tallinn, 
  same in finland either socks , slippers or house shoes . 
  traditional variant of house shoes look like [ this . 
  ] ( http://reinokauppa.fi/2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/reino_ruskea.jpg ) while those shoes were earlier considered something only grandpa would use , interesting recent development is that they 've became popular in office jobs , especially in creative field like in ad agencies or software programming . 
  some companies even buy them for their employers and save money in cleaning costs and employers are happy to wear comfortable slippers instead of sweaty tight shoes . 
  there is also a `` granny '' model , which looks like [ this . 
  ] ( http://reinokauppa.fi/2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/maino_skotti_1001_b0c_b.jpg ), 
  in finland bagged milk came and disappeared in the 60 's , before that it was either glass bottles or one has to bring own pitcher to the grocery store . 
  in old summer cottages it 's still possible to found such a nostalgic , slightly kitschy mementos of those days as doormats crocheted of the used milk bags . 
  earlier when nokia was `` connecting people '' i would have said it has something to with the phone sex . 
  perhaps using the vibration feature of an inserted phone for some `` other purposes '' because we are people of few words , speech is not necessary . 
  * english : primary school 3-9 ( 7 years ) compulsory , gymnasium 1-3 ( 3 years ) * swedish : primary school 7-9 ( 3 years ) compulsory , gymnasium 1-3 ( 3 years ) * german : primary school 8-9 ( 2 years ) elective , gymnasium 1-3 ( 3 years ) native language finnish was compulsory all through primary school and gymnasium . 
  at my time , teaching of foreign languages was based more to grammatical correctness and spelling than to expand vocabulary and having practical skill set . 
  there is [ this ] ( http://game-game.se/68264/ ) game about `` dykning ekorre '' although it 's about parachute diving instead of scuba diving . 
  then again that 's only thing which made me think that the story is also known in sweden . 
  most of the urban legends are spread over the language barriers so while being told to happen a friend of a friend or a distant relative , similar story could be found in some other country . 
  i know one story i suspect , might be originally from finland or sweden but i 'm not sure . 
   there were some kids who found dead squirrel in the woods and decided to prank their old neighbor , against who they had some grudge . 
  they dress the squirrel carcass with [ barbie scuba diving kit ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/d4/a1/fb/d4a1fbac38b8d405dd9fab49c8c2488f--barbie-playsets-barbie-girl.jpg ) and put it in a rainwater collector bucket of that neighbor . 
  in alternative version squirrel is put in the fishing net of that neighbor . 
  neighbor then got heart attack and died , when seeing the squirrel . 
   it was also fashionable to get an euro kit . 
  i bought two of [ those starter kits ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzqyoqx.jpg ) and saved them unopened unlike the most . 
  there are wild [ stories ] ( https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-a-2002-01-04-6-coin-66266282/539502.html ) about the high prices ( 400 $ ) people have sold them . 
  however at the moment they are sold with much more reasonable prices at [ ebay . 
  ] ( https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=finnish+euro+starter+kit&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_from=r40&amp;_trksid=m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=finland+euro+starter+kit&amp;_sacat=0 ) then again even with those ebay prices the increase of value is pretty good for something bought originally for 46 fim ( ~ 7,74 $ ) and could be sold today at 50 $ . 
  these two adages comes to mind : * `` si vis pacem para bellum '' * and `` peace through superior firepower '', 
  in finland [ kaldoaivin er\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4 , ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/kaldoaivin+er%c3%a4maa/@69.7287038,27.7816621,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x45cc7e2f3c0f435b:0xb387cc939602ebf5!8m2!3d69.7289324!4d27.7822094 ) something like 40 km to the nearest road and human habitat . 
  while i think [ finnish bread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_bread ) is the best , since it 's not allowed , i must give credit to the estonians because their rye bread comes close to finnish . 
  no vending machines because it 's not allowed to sell alcohol if buyer is too drunken . 
  the hours for selling alcohol are from 9:00 to 21:00 , so no 24/7 either . 
  pubs and bars can sell to 01:30 and nightclubs to 03:30 . 
  they used to be quite common as the first motorized vehicle teenagers could get at 15 years old , especially in rural municipalities . 
  driving license which came 2011 might have slightly diminished their popularity, 
  it looked like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sey4uizqnly ) ( helsinki 1952 ) . 
  in finnish trombi is a borrowed word . 
  it probably has something to do with the shape which resembles old trumpet . 
  in italian [ tromba ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tromba ) is trumpet while in spanish it means tornado, 
  it depends of season , now in in summertime it 's the trinity of new potatoes , pickled herring and rye bread . 
  i guess some of them , those about russians are from soviet era . 
  [ `` viron susi '' ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudenmorsian ) might be the oldest one . 
  for some reason in finnish tradition wolf is strongly connected to the baltic countries . 
  in fact even at moment there are about the [ same number 250 ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunt#levila ) or even more wolves in estonia than in finland and in latvia there are 500 - 600 wolves . 
  yes , i agree that yugoslavia was a bit different communist country , nevertheless still not comparable with the west or how they are nowadays . 
  also albania was different , but their situation was probably even worse than what it was in soviet block countries . 
  for a while ago in finland there were serious discussion about different kind of limit for cigarettes , instead of age it would would have been the year of birth . 
  persons born after that year would have been never allowed to buy cigarettes . 
  i 'm not even sure if it 's the only problem ...  however to the choice of that particular tool might have affected it 's depiction in the soviet flag . 
  estonians , czechs and slovenians at their own , east germany by reunification . 
  then again they were already more advanced than the rest before communism stalled their development . 
  in some of those other countries , the development might have been even faster paced although they have n't managed to catch up the lead yet . 
  however volume of [ customary american coffee cup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cup_\\ ( unit \\ ) #customary _ cup ) volume is 4 oz , about 0,12 l . so to convert your daily consumption of coffee to that unit you have to multiply your `` cup '' number by three . 
  that probably comes from a urban legend told in finland about soviet [ stakhanovite movement , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stakhanovite_movement ) how `` shock workers '' in some factory that produced agricultural machinery , managed to exceed their 5-year plan quota by using hammer to fix all the screws . 
  * `` speak norwegian '' - to puke * `` everything those germans invent '' - said when wondering something , especially when it 's not an invention but for example exotic animal * `` hungry as a wolf from estonia '' - really hungry * `` cold as in hell of russians '' - really cold weather * '' ` teknik ' said russian when he saw a digging bar '' - when one solves a task with simple and crude manner * `` russian screwdriver '' - a hammer * `` did you made it by yourself or bought it from russia ? '', 
  - said when mocking the work quality . 
  * `` better than a russian new one '' - for any used ware * '' ( somebodys ) hands are swinging like he 's a turkish salter of cunts '' - when somebody tries to do something hastily but with weird and unnecessarily complicated way '' * `` smokes like a turk '' - chainsmoker, 
  besides finnish his native language , our president has studied english , swedish and french in school . 
  he has also studied russian later at adult life . 
  volume of typical [ finnish coffee mug ] ( https://res.cloudinary.com/tokmanni/image/upload/w_1000,h_1033,c_pad,b_white,f_auto/d_default.png/6411801000993.jpg ) is 0,3 l ~ about 10 fl oz . 
  when finns speak about how many `` cups '' of coffee they drink in a day , they mean those mugs . 
  also we drink [ most coffee per capita in the world . 
  ] ( https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_8602_top_coffee_drinking_nations_n.jpg ), 
   or is it more involved than that ? 
  standard coffee maker in finnish kitchens is [ this ] ( https://www.moccamaster.com ) fine dutch product and preferred coffee type is light roasted arabica . 
  saara does n't even actually speak spanish , she 's just good at imitating , but carola 's father was a diplomat and she learned spanish in her childhood in spain . 
  we have [ salty licorice chips ] ( https://youtu.be/v4lqqaqjnqs?t=535 ) ( of course ) . 
  it seems that surprisingly we are [ 3rd in daily biking , ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_406_en.pdf ) ( pg 12 . ), 
   approximately four in ten respondents in the netherlands ( 43 % ) cycle daily . 
  roughly three in ten respondents in denmark ( 30 % ) and finland ( 28 % ) also cycle daily . 
  although situation has probably changed now , at [ 2003 ] ( https://www.hel.fi/hel2/tietokeskus/suunnat/ss107/kansi.html ) my home city helsinki was 5th in the length of dedicated bicycle lanes compared the whole road network and another finnish city of oulu was 1st . 
  while i have n't any statistics of whole of finland , i still doubt that the situation of [ oulu ] ( http://torontoist.com/2017/02/what-toronto-can-learn-about-winter-cycling-from-oulu/ ) is entirely unique . 
  the numbers there might be a little bit higher than elsewhere but there is similar will to develop bike lane network also in other municipalities . 
  what kind of spanish accent these finnish singers have ? 
  * [ carola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8vp3xmc0go ) * [ saara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ubibcdax-g ) is it immediately obvious that their native language is not spanish ?
