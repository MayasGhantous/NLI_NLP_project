  then when they have confirmed at least one of the suspects like the one they got from forest they search all the towers his phone has been connected recently and cross reference that data to the phones that have moved from one tower to another approximately at the same time meaning that phone owners have traveled in the same vehicle . 
  they also compare their list of suspected phones if they could pin-point any in that same location they caught a confirmed suspect . 
  now their list of suspicious phones has narrowed considerably and if any of those numbers connects to the tower they are already probably almost sure that some of their targets can be found nearby . 
  doing things like that might need lot of work hours even if it was computerized in some degree , so they probably reserve it only for the most critical threats to national security . 
  knife making is a typical school project in finland for example in [ this video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjh6wakpoxu ) although most of the video , is teacher showing different steps , [ in the end ] ( https://youtu.be/qjh6wakpoxu?t=464 ) of it there are examples of knives his class of 12 year old students have built for themselves . 
  it is a suggestion to unborn like `` crawl back to what ever dirty hole you were spawn . '', 
  other similar is * `` ved\u00e4 nyt vittu p\u00e4\u00e4h\u00e4s '' * ~ `` draw a cunt over your head now '' . 
  some more ingenious finnish curses or insults : * * `` sut pit\u00e4s pist\u00e4\u00e4 turkin hihaan ja nussia uudestaan '' * ~ `` you should be put in the sleeve of fur coat and fuck again '' once again same idea of unborn , sleeve of fur coat is obvious euphemism . 
  * * `` lirahtanut kusta joukkoon '' * loosely ~ `` piss was one ingredient when you were conceived '' * * `` tuppikulli '' * ~ someone who has non-retractable foreskin i.e. 
  virgin * * `` kurahaara '' * ~ lit . 
  `` mud crotch '' dirty vagina, 
   in a modern democracy the decision of that is up to the justice system , of which he is and should be free to avail himself . 
  since he 's clearly abusing that same system , should it be allowed to continue and the world have annual `` breivik show '' . 
  as far as i have understood the main reason for his isolation of general population is his own safety and to compensate that isolation he 's been given extra space , those three cells . 
  if they fulfill his wish and put him in the general population he 'd certainly lose those privileges and there would be constant threat to his life . 
  if he survived the first beating he 'd probably demanded to get back in the isolation . 
   he should be incarcerated within the rules of a system is there really any serious question that it has n't been happened ? 
  are his complaints even worth of any scrutiny ? 
  then again when they were ultimately deemed unfounded and just pretense for opportunity to spread his agenda , it also ensures that his staying behind bars . 
  his blatant lack of remorse for his acts proves that he 's still menace to society and not safe to release anytime soon . 
  the scale , escapes per 10.000 inmates , article uses in statistics is extremely misleading . 
   is n't there at least some institute they can lock him up in ? 
  that certainly would happen if the the killer has been an ethnic swede or from other european country , but i wonder what will they do in this case . 
  [ gun ownership numbers in sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) ( 4th in europe , 9th in world ) are actually relatively high compared to level of other european countries . 
  above sweden are only switzerland which number includes military weapons held at private homes without ammunition , cyprus which high numbers are effects of [ the conflicts because of the division at 70 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_invasion_of_cyprus ) and serbia because of breakup of yugoslavia . 
  in finland he could n't be charged for any crime ( < 15 y.o. ), 
  either . 
  although it would be almost absolutely certain that he 'd be taken custody from his parents and locked somewhere for a long time , that would n't be considered as a punishment . 
  tornedalen yes of course , perhaps whole norrbotten and even v\u00e4sterbotten , but that 's enough . 
  i mean there has to be a line somewhere who we could accept . 
  indians fighting against turks in the soil of far away foreign land might have considered them as mercenaries . 
  but 15 kilometres is easily an artillery distance . 
  his hometown lied under reach of is barrages . 
  defending your home , pushing enemy back and surviving alive is a prize of itself . 
  if he wants rewards and compensations for his injury he should be taking them from his enemy or perhaps from those who support that enemy . 
  i do n't make any assumptions other than based the text of that article :  `` he volunteered to fight with the kurdish peshmerga in the summer of 2014 , because he wanted to stop is fighters who had advanced to a position 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) from the border of his hometown of dohuk '' that 's what he said according the article , and that 's a damn good reason to join fight . 
  what i do n't understand is the mental gymnastics how he managed to turn that as a war of somebody else than his own people and their survival . 
   `` but if i fight your war , why do n't you help me when i become injured in that war ? '', 
  how come he does n't understand that it is n't germany 's war , eu 's war or usa 's war but war for his own people ? 
  he was fighting for the future of his home region and those other countries only support that fight . 
  in the end it 's up to him and his compatriots to decide what that future will be . 
  here are two cases \u00d6stersundom 's police reported in their website to received at saturday night : * [ at 01:00 rape attempt , ] ( https://polisen.se/jamtland/aktuellt/handelser/jamtland/2016-03-06-0100-valdtakt-forsok-ostersund/ ) three 18 - 25 y.o. 
  men fell down woman and tried to undress her pants . 
  culprits described to spoke broken swedish . 
  man hit lone woman with fist to her face and when she fell down , press her head on the ground . 
  culprit described to be foreign looking i 'm tempted to believe that two that kind of occurrences at the same night , at street , at cold winter weather , at normal weekend and in smallish 44 000 population town , used to be very rare or dare i say even unheard just few years back . 
  he does n't mention refugees but speaks about deportations and detentions , that could be interpreted to mean either one or both of two groups of people . 
  among those who have applied for asylum as refugees , there are some who wo n't get the refugee status because they are coming from countries that are considered safe and who 'd get deported but their own countries ( morocco , algeria ? ), 
  wo n't accept them back anymore . 
  with detainees , he could mean those who have committed crimes in their host countries . 
  the governments of host countries rather deport them after convictions but ca n't do that because their countries of origin are not safe . 
  instead of letting them loose among the population of host countries , his proposition is to send them to be established `` euro-guantanamo '' or [ `` christmas island '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_island_immigration_reception_and_processing_centre ) in greece . 
  paying debt part comes from by greece allowing some of their islands to be used for that purpose and working as a `` jailer '' . 
  people do n't usually take their cell phone into the shower . 
  perhaps we could find some suitable remote uninhabited island from the coast of greenland for that purpose ? 
  like greece it starts with gre ... so it 's close enough . 
  typical finnish ( clumsy ) conversation opening is * `` on ilmoja pidellyt . 
  '' * ( not exact translation but it means something like ~ `` i 've been wondering about these exceptional weather conditions . '' ), 
  when you absolutely must speak with stranger , which is of course faux pas . 
   `` siena '' is `` wall '' in estonian wall is [ * `` sein '' * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sein#estonian ) and in finnish [ * `` sein\u00e4 '' * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sein%c3%a4#finnish ) both from the same baltic origin . 
  estonians are 7th in [ english proficiency index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index ) having higher position than for example most of central european countries . 
  it 's still above infamous honey boo boo 's `` sketti and butter '' which contained sticks of butter generously lathered with ketchup and melted in microwave . 
  it 's known also in finland , here it 's called [ `` talkkuna '' . 
  ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/talkkuna ) interestingly , because of pea flour , it belongs to the group of select few plant based traditional dishes that contain [ complete protein , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complete_protein ) one could survive without eating anything but kama/talkkuna . 
  if it 's eaten traditional way with forest berries and fermented dairy products , it 's probably as good health food as muesli . 
  that -12 \u00b0 c is still in the range where [ ** babies take their naps in outdoors ** ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21537988 ) in nordic countries although of course not in t-shirt . 
  there are also proponents of cold therapy who swear by the name of [ shirtless jogging during winter . 
  ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/626/1288659589000.jpg ) cold exposure increases the level of brown fat which is supposed to have [ beneficial effects . 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/healthy-brown-fat-may-reduce-risk-for-obesity-and-diabetes/ ), 
  i expected [ this one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfg9xopkk ), 
  have you discarded the practice of writing their birthday as january 1st ? 
  i 've heard that it 's a kind of racial slur or jargon in sweden to say that someone is `` f\u00f6dd i f\u00f6rsta januari '' . 
  at first i thought that the finnish word * `` laakso '' * might have something to do with * `` laskea '' , `` laskeutua '' * ~ descend , but [ suomisanakirja ] ( http://www.suomisanakirja.fi/laakso ) claims etymology be volga-finnic * `` lakce '' * , which puts it to the group of very old finnish words . 
   what would a secular young man who may be killed for his beliefs do other than run to europe ? 
  join with other secular minded young men and fight for secular syria . 
  so the [ summerisle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/summerisle_%28the_wicker_man%29 ) from `` the wicker man '' is true . 
  if they really want to grow palms in their islands , they should still probably burn some mainlanders . 
  uk is the only eu country where there is [ fptp voting system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) , same as in usa . 
  uk had [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum,_2011 ) 2011 about to changing the system but it was rejected . 
  [ article 6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty#article_6 ) of north atlantic treaty determines that the treaty covers only such territories that are located north of [ the tropic of cancer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty#article_6 ) , aruba and cura\u00e7ao are both south of it . 
  so the only european caribbean territories that the treaty theoretically covered were part of the bahamas until they became independent 1973 . 
  [ kaali crater ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that [ santa claus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_nicholas ) is more famous than suleiman or ataturk . 
   why does it matter that it was discovered on halloween ? 
  good question , that 's because it fits the mythological importance of that day . 
  [ samhain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samhain#in_irish_mythology ) as a festival for the dead is the time `` when the ` doorways ' to the otherworld opened , allowing supernatural beings and the souls of the dead to come into our world '' . 
  so it 's like the worst day in calendar to go around poking the ancient graveyards , if one happens to believe that stuff . 
   `` leave '' is a good old anglo-saxon word , whereas `` remain '' is one of those new french words that the normans brought over . 
  so , if the choice of words has been `` depart '' and `` stay '' , the outcome of referendum would have turned other way . 
  so they do n't do that to get information , which criminal organization parents of the pupil might be associated ? 
  italian ( no affiliation ) italian-neapolitan ( camorra ) italian-sicilian ( mafia ), 
  then again he has said that he do n't want any lawyers and declined to talk with them . 
  in that case is it ok to them represent him even against his own will ? 
  after all , those lawyers ca n't do their job without having some conversation with their customer . 
  also the whole question now is about lawyers during the investigation which are not mandatory , when the trial will come the court will order some lawyer to him even if he does n't want any at that time either . 
  of course it would have been better for his defense if he have had the same lawyer all the time but it 's not possible to fix stupidity . 
   it is believed the rune was used as part of the entrance to the old church .
