  probably as a doorstep to make baptized former pagans to trample something they used consider sacred when they entered church and deliberately left outside of the building itself . 
  it most certainly was n't the most popular , however that 's what they claim in that cover . 
  i 've heard that , [ same song ] ( https://youtu.be/2q-lkpwotje?t=23 ) in finnish . 
  i translated titles from [ original post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/suomi/comments/56n7mf/pirte%c3%a4%c3%a4_luettavaa/ ) in r/suomi, 
   how many million islands does finland have ? 
  is that all private property ? 
  there is something like 50000 `` islands '' just only in [ archipelago sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archipelago_sea ) including all the uninhabitable rocks and skerries . 
  there are some estimates about 180000 islands in finland , but i do n't know if they 've had to count also the inland islands of the lakes to reach that number . 
  some of the islands are private property and some belong to the government . 
  as a finn , interesting to compare finland ( index points 82 , 6th ) and sweden ( index points 85 , 3rd ) . 
  it seems that finland actually gets better number in indicators that are infrastructural or at least there are no significant difference . 
  however finland lose most points in such indicators as suicide , alcohol , smoking , intimate partner violence and violence . 
  there are also people of [ african origin in abkhazia , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abkhazians_of_african_descent ) caucasus who have lived there hundreds of years . 
  i remember seen the tv-series in my childhood , as it was also shown in finnish tv . 
  it was one of my favorites . 
  theme music was really a blast from the past . 
   a bit like finnish licorice with regular old salt on it . 
  that 's probably the reason why we do n't see that kind of licorice over here and only type at least somewhat compatible with finnish palate are just those a aniseed spiced ones . 
   your inferior salmiak do they sell finnish salmiak in the netherlands ? 
  if i 've understood it right , the main difference between our salty liquorices is that you use also aniseed to spice yours while it 's not so common up here . 
  here in finland some call wednesday as `` pikkulauantai '' ~ `` small saturday '' as an unofficial party day besides of weekend . 
  although [ real pros ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mejhxsi-t50 ) party all the other weekdays except friday , saturday and sunday when bars are crowded with amateurs . 
  technically chocolate originates from america , more precisely from central and southern america , although nowadays the largest cocoa bean producers are in africa . 
  however you are absolutely correct in your claim of ersatzprodukt . 
  i ca n't understand how anybody who have tasted real chocolate could eat those fake vile tasting puke chocolate bars without spitting them out immediately after the first bite .

  i do n't think that in helsinki there are any single bus routes with that tight schedule . 
  however in the downtown there are such destinations like the main railway station , one could jump from certain bus stops in any bus that all go to there , so that 's about the same , every minute or two . 
  university is one stop earlier than the main railway station . 
   bus network is relatively sparse ? 
  it depends of the route and the time . 
  there are some routes where the buses come every 15 minutes and others with fewer buses and it may take 1 hour between the next bus, 
  i assume so , if there are fewer passengers than expected the drivers must wait so that they do n't arrive at the bus stops earlier than marked in schedule . 
  it also seems that it 's not very fast because : `` total length of the route ~ 31.2 km '' and it takes 1h 23 min from end to end , including 45 minutes walking to the right bus stop and waiting the next connection . 
  we have [ this ] ( https://www.hsl.fi/en/timetables-and-routes ) quite accurate route planner that gives you also the connections with different bus routes , trams , metro and local trains . 
  of course there are things that may affect the accuracy like changing weather conditions but usually buses arrive just in a minute they should .

  following that suggestion i 'd most likely arrive exactly at that time route planner predicts . 
  duck hunting season starts august 20th at 12:00 . 
  if you are in some small town with nearby lake and hunter population you 'd think that wwiii has just started when you hear them shooting first volley at noon . 
  yes that 's [ true , ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_muinaisnimet ) i just tried to consider pagan and popularity aspects . 
  like one could n't get more pagan than naming one 's child with the name of gods or goddesses . 
  [ something ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_tours ) happened also 1284 years ago . 
  finnish male given names [ ahti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahti ) , [ tapio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tapio_ ( spirit \\ ) ) and [ ilmari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilmarinen#prehistory ) are pre-christian era gods and female given names [ tuulikki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuulikki_ ( name \\ ) ) , [ tellervo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tellervo ) and [ vellamo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vellamo ) are goddesses . 
  for [ pearls ? 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/helmet#finnish ) actually it means [ network of helsinki metropolitan area libraries . 
  ] ( http://www.helmet.fi/en-us/info/what_is_helmet ), 
   the biggest regional language dispute in estonia in finland similar dispute is the correct name for cloudberry , if it 's ` hilla ' ( north and east ) , ` lakka ' ( west ) or suomuurain ( in the middle ) there are also smaller regional areas where that berry is called as nevamarja , valokki or lintti . 
  another one is if sauna whisk is ` vihta ' ( west ) or ` vasta ' ( east ) . 
  that indeed resembles finnish and estonian ` lumi ' . 
  [ here ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_lunta_tarkoittavista_suomen_kielen_sanoista ) is a list of about 70 finnish words for snow . 
  some of them are compound words that include ` lumi ' word , but most are unique that have no other meaning but describing different types of snow . 
  there are probably even more dialectical words for snow , so that list is not even complete . 
  in finland `` pilsneri '' means low alcohol , below 2,8 % ( by volume ) beer . 
  exact distance between highest accessible buildings in helsinki , [ the tower of olympic stadium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_olympic_stadium ) ( 72,7 m ) and [ the tallinn tv tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn_tv_tower ) ( 314 m ) is a little bit less 79,7 km . 
  in a clear weather it 's possible to see from one tower the other . 
  edit , some videos : * [ lights of tallinn tv tower from finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frxk_53zxn4&amp;feature=youtu.be= ) * [ tallinn tv tower ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz0al2ywayo ), 
  does the lithuanian word for hedgehog something to do with pig like in english ( - hog ) ? 
  i assume that the word for smoke and fog , r\u016bke is related for swedish word for smoke ` r\u00f6k ' .

  they compare differences of tunes in different areas in finland . 
  there are also brief chapter of shepherd horns ( 07:57 ) and a nice kalevala tune song used for calming the cows when they were milked ( 14:57 ) .

  beside finland 's [ all medals per capita ] ( http://www.medalspercapita.com/#medals-per-capita:all-time ) also [ gold medals per capita ] ( http://www.medalspercapita.com/#golds-per-capita:all-time ) and [ weighted medals per capita ] ( http://www.medalspercapita.com/#weighted-per-capita:all-time ) i assume that medals estonian athletes achieved during occupation are counted for soviet union in those statistics . 
  at least estonian weightlifter [ jaan talts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaan_talts ) has two olympic medals : gold from munchen and silver from mexico city that were counted for soviet union . 
  there might be some other estonian olympic medalists from that time . 
  as i see it , what he did was actually a heroic attempt to distract the shooter . 
  his act was done for inviting shooter 's whole attention to himself by taunting the shooter to buy time for the people at the street level to escape . 
  compared to them he was relatively safe at his balcony , so while he set himself as a target he might have saved life of some other person . 
  if someone falls in the tiger cage in the zoo you are allowed to pelt the tiger with stones in that particular situation although otherwise it 's considered animal cruelty . 
  according [ this ] ( https://translate.google.fi/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ess.fi%2fmielipide%2fesalaiset%2f2011%2f06%2f14%2fnaimisiin-vasta-aikuisena&amp;edit-text= ) article the average age when finnish women got their first children is 28 while the age of marriage is 30 for women and 32 for men . 
  to postpone the first children that far , late 30 's might already affect quite a lot for fertility , so most women who want to have children dare not do that . 
  i 'd say that having kids not earlier than late 20 's , marriage at 30 's . 
  however most move away from their parents quite soon after they become 20 . 
  no , and most young couples move together , maybe get their first children before even considering about marriage . 
   apparently it is viewed like those ghettos in american movies , where you can escape police . 
  [ kasbah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kasbah ) is the word you are looking for, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island#climate ) more like place with 12 months of slush . 
   as a norwegian i would gladly offer you jan mayen my suggestion is something little more remote and isolated like [ bouvet\u00f8ya , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) after all we should n't take unnecessary risk of their escape . 
  i used to play `` shogun total war '' , and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlsivcr.png ) is how i remember the map . 
  those small islands in the south and west were `` trade posts '' , i guess there is real life counterpart for them . 
  do czechs build also new libraries or are those libraries all from begone era ? 
  i mean that the number of library buildings is probably not the whole truth . 
  if you know what you want , it 's easy to e-reserve a book and have it send to the library which is located most convenient for you , but that library might be a smaller side library with smaller selection . 
  at least half of the fun is go to the main library with vast selection to find something you did n't knew you want to read or if you have work to be done with better technological facilities and large reference library . 
  in helsinki they just ( 2010 ) finished the [ new helsinki university library ] ( http://www.helsinkibusinesshub.fi/ghp/files/2012/11/kaisa_house.jpg ) and former university library became [ national library . 
  ] ( https://ollilaasanen.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/20121115-5d2-0095.jpg ) at the moment they is also another [ project ] ( http://keskustakirjasto.fi/en/project/ ) to build a new [ central library to helsinki ] ( http://keskustakirjasto.fi/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/2010/07/1st_prize_kaannos-13.jpg ) which will be finished at 2017 - 2018 . 
   do you really think it took him two years to find a kitchen knife ? 
  no , if he was a sleeper agent , he probably get tired of waiting for the orders and decided to act by his own for getting those 72 virgins that were promised to him . 
  i did n't claim he was sharpest pencil in the box . 
  more likely a similar `` four lions '' - case as the [ christmas bomber in sweden 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings ) who managed to blow only himself . 
   also why would a terrorist go through the refugee vetting process ? 
  to stay under the radar of course . 
  yes , they actually [ grow bananas ] ( http://www.freshplaza.com/article/149777/turkish-banana-growing-goes-undercover ) in commercial scale in turkey . 
  some other `` banana republics '' in europe are france , spain , portugal , italy , greece and most surprisingly also [ iceland . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_production_in_iceland ), 
  those paris attackers were obviously better funded and more organized . 
  however is it really out of the question that there is some [ `` four lions '' - type ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew-srlq9tli ) branch of their organization in pakistan without proper connections who 'd still decided to send their own agent to participate in `` global jihad '' ? 
  i mean after all even [ their fighters ] ( https://youtu.be/am3eltvf52i?t=107 ) sometimes seem more like ragtag bunch of nincompoops . 
  while first of those videos is from comedic movie , the second one that could have been a scene from the same of movie is n't .
