   secularism thrives in peace - when people understand that a good life for them and their neighbors is possible right here , right now . 
  why here instead of their country ? 
  could religion have something to with it ? 
   if you take religion out of the equation , the middle east is still not a very good place ( for example ) . 
  how it is possible to do that , i mean their religion seems to be main reason that hinders their progression and development as a society ? 
  i did n't claim he was any good , on the contrary . 
  besides the idea of their radicalization here in europe might be even more scary idea than his being someone who was send here , because it means there are nothing we could do for catching them without putting them all under constant surveillance . 
   the islamic state group released a video on tuesday purportedly featuring ** the 17-year-old ** while they now seem to have changed their opinion about his country of origin , they still somehow try to grasp their belief of his age and that he was minor as a last straw . 
  some even try to claim that he was only `` radicalized '' in germany without giving a thought that he was a sleeper agent on a mission though not particularly successful . 
  then again i 'm not sure which alternative is more scary : his being a sleeper agent who managed to pass all their vetting or his radicalization in secular germany instead being radicalized since the beginning at pakistan or many other islamic countries he passed through on his route to his destination . 
   there needs to be an islamic movement to cut that crap out . 
  or better yet ** secular movement ** that allows all religions or non-religious ideologies proselytize also in islamic countries . 
  competition is unfair when western countries allow saudi and gulf emirate salafists come to preach here and finance mosques although there is no similar opportunity for western ideologies in their country of origin . 
  there is no equilibrium if there is a cancerous tumor that is allowed in isolation to metastasize and spit out preachers and mosques here while we ca n't do the same . 
  another possibility is to admit that there is a limit in the idea of religious freedom we have cherished and political islam is out of those boundaries . 
  while i 'd rather see importance of religion to disappear from the daily life of people , i would still understand it 's meaning for some people when the rites are only a quaint traditions reserved for for funerals , weddings or some religious holidays . 
  i do n't know , i mean i recognized the name as the place for ecumenical councils although i 'm not especially religious . 
  just a while ago , i had misconception it was situated in italy or greece . 
  actually your mentioning the name made me check if it 's in france . 
  funeral in the sea , the version that 's usually done for goldfish ( flush down from toilet bowl ) . 
  that would be even more confusing because most people think [ nicaea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicaea ) as the ancient city of turkey which used to have that name . 
  in finland we have [ these kind ] ( http://www.destamatic.fi/betonituotteet/tuotekuvat/muut/betoniporsaat.jpg ) barriers . 
  they are usually called as `` concrete pigs '' , same name is used also in sweden . 
  because they are considered ugly , lately they have started to make `` concrete pigs '' that actually look like [ piglets , ] ( https://asiakas.kotisivukone.com/files/heljajarvinen.kotisivukone.com/.album/1310935242660_1_large.jpg ) another model looks like [ turtle . 
  yes , that could be said , but how hard it 's to be above communist and fascist dictatorships . 
  all the existing members of eec except italy were above uk . 
  main reason for why they accepted those exceptions for uk at that time , was probably out of pity for less wealthier nation . 
   it was a piss poor country with second world living standards bevor it joined the eu . 
  i thought that was only a banter , but 1973 only european countries with [ lower gdp per capita ] ( http://countryeconomy.com/gdp?year=1973 ) than uk ( 3,424 $ ) were italy ( 3,186 $ ) , ireland ( 2,407 $ ) and at that time dictatorships and/or military juntas greece ( 2,500 $ ) , spain ( 2,235 $ ) and portugal ( 1,749 $ ), 
  he has seen too many us crime shows in tv and erroneously believed that he 's in america . 
  lol i guess it 's the same as thinking that all finns are like those who wear swishing track suits , although it has been decades they have done any other athletic things than pull their beer carts into tallinn cruise ships . 
  those finns with negativity probably have a low self-esteem and refuse to understand that estonia is not anymore the same country as it was quarter of century ago . 
  but of course we are , and have always been , anything for our own mini-me . 
  one of the not necessarily least important reason is to finally have somebody with whom we share our own secret language other council members do n't understand . 
  that 's what i also think , if estonia would be admitted first it would `` leave the door open '' and work as precedent . 
  same meters would be applied for you that were applied for estonia and there could be no arbitrary demands anymore . 
  it would also encourage you to make changes or reach achievements that were demanded . 
  i must admit that i do n't know that much of the the progress of latvia and lithuania as i 've seen in estonia , but i guess also you should be admitted in `` the club '' sooner or later . 
  would you think it would be better if estonia will be the first as a `` pathfinder '' , because it would almost certainly open the similar path for you and hasten the process or should all three admitted at the same time ? 
  all three baltic countries are already observers in the nordic council . 
  we should finally recognize the progress of at least estonians and grant them full membership if that 's what they want . 
  it does n't go like that , biggest peak in childbirths at least in finland is during february - march , nine months after midsummer . 
  it 's exactly opposite it 's those white nights you ca n't sleep because it 's too much light . 
  actually alphabet is the easiest part . 
  you could compare it how some letters in english and french are pronounced differently . 
  [ russian orthography ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_orthography ) is fairly regular and consistent . 
  for example it 's certainly easier than in english , once you know the cyrillic alphabet you know how a word is pronounced without having to heard it . 
  the most difficult part is the grammar . 
  ] ( http://www.hs.fi/blogi/narrienlaiva/a1305944213082 ), 
  it seems they made some kind of pact there . 
  in case of norway , the top country of the list , mountains and fjords without bridges have also something to do with their number . 
  long land routes with low speed limits makes flying a tempting alternative and only option in emergency situations . 
  i wonder what is the definition of airport in that statistics . 
  could it be any airfield with regular scheduled flights . 
  i mean i used to live with smallish town , pop . 
  7000 and there was still an airfield with landing lights and hangar buildings . 
  [ there are many more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_airports_in_finland ) similar airfields all over in finland without scheduled flights , although many of them certainly have other traffic in daily bases . 
  so if those were included finland 's number will be 93 and [ norway 's total number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_airports_in_norway ) of airports and airfields is 97 . 
  their smaller `` airports '' are probably similar than airfields near similar sized towns in finland , only difference is the regular scheduled flights because of their more challenging terrain . 
  if it worked like that , also americans , belgians and french would be eligible . 
  i believe that `` meaulc qu '' could be quite close approximation . 
  those poorer countries are chosen because of their compatibility and potential to grow one day at the same level as the richer countries so that there is no need to pay for developing their infrastructure anymore . 
  when that day comes , trade between them will be mutually lucrative and benefit both parties more than earlier when one party was much poorer than other . 
   some languages make it hard to pronounce english words properly without a thick accent because they lack some sounds ( like what happens for spanish and finnish , for example ) actually at least in case of finnish it probably has more to do with [ orthographic depth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthographic_depth ) than lack of sounds . 
  compared to almost extreme regularity of finnish language where there is only one phoneme corresponding each letter , the irregularity and fucked up orthography makes english to resemble for a finn more to egyptian hieroglyphs or chinese hanzi characters where lettering of the word only slightly hints how it 's pronounced . 
  so if a finnish person learns his vocabulary mainly from the written source he necessarily has no idea of the correct pronunciation of many words because he might have never heard them spoken aloud and instead of bothering to learn also the pronunciation he just naturally assumes some kind of approximation between what the letter phoneme correspondence means in finnish and how he believes a native speaker would spell them . 
  i would n't be surprised to learning that there is something similar behind the difficulties of english pronunciation of spanish people . 
  after all also spanish writing system is quite regular and their language is usually considered having shallow orthography . 
  i could imagine this as a polandball : scene one : family of uk are in the country club of eu because e. has decided to cancel their membership . 
  the main reason for the cancellation are his tenants , brown people of luton , who he mistakenly believes that eu has something to do with although they are there as a legacy from the days when his crime family used to roam the world robbing and extorting brown people their valuables . 
  his other beef is with the board of club who he thinks have got their position `` undemocratically '' although instead of direct voting they 've been chosen because of their expertise by the elected parliament of the club , while at same time uk family still uses antiquated fptp system that gives unrivaled majority power to someone who represents only 37 % of population . 
  although uk is nowadays richer than ever because they 've already been in mainly legitimate business with eu for decades , e. still reminisces the past days when his crime gang used to be the largest of the world and all the problems could be solved with violence . 
  scene two : family member s. is discontent of the decision to cancel their membership of club eu . 
  she has already once tried to leave uk gang , but at that time she was threaten by e. that he 'll veto any attempt for re-application from inside of the eu and she 'll never get a new membership to her beloved club eu again if she leaves the gang . 
  to sweeten the deal and make her change her mind e. also promised s. that they could get separate bank accounts so she could decide herself what she will do with her salary . 
  of course e. never kept those promises like he always does . 
  so this time is going to be different , if e. wants leave he can do it by himself , s. will stay with the club . 
  during her long years in uk , s. has also learned how to cleverly manipulate shitty fptp system so at the moment she has much more power than rightfully belongs to her . 
  even domestic abuse that s. has suffered a lot and which used to be quite common earlier does n't fear her anymore because eu does n't accept it . 
  besides s. there is also another gang member ni . 
  who is not so keen of leaving the club and has started to think if he should return to his real family i. who left uk gang decades ago after bitter struggle , is quite successful businessman and also belongs to club eu nowadays . 
  how e. solves the stalemate situation inside the gang . 
  will e. and w. dare leave the club eu together abandoning s. and ni . 
  their behind and in essence breaking the whole uk family or was the whole cancellation idea just a ploy designed to extort eu some more exemptions for uk , never meant to actually go through which still astonishingly happened ? 
  stay tuned to see what happens in the next episode . 
   some uninhabited island . 
  that could be the [ principality of sealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_sealand ) . 
  however my suggestion is that after separation of england , wales , scotland and n. ireland and establishing of suk , queen abdicates her power and title as a reward for prince of sealand who becomes the king of united kingdom that now consist only sealand , while queen keeps on ruling the suk . 
   the problem is there is no plan it 's actually pretty interesting what will happen to nigel farage and his ukip ? 
  i mean they are the party whose main agenda used to be independence from eu and now they 've achieved it , so the whole purpose of their existence disappeared . 
  what are they doing next , do they have any contingency plan or are they now satisfied and just rest on their laurels and cease their party ? 
  if they decide to keep on what will be the next issue on their list ? 
  if nothing they promised will change or better yet things that used to be ok turn worse during the negotiations how are they going to explain it to their voters ? 
  it 's interesting to compare [ numbers ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list#data ) of us finns ( 4th - 45.3 ) to swiss ( 3rd - 45.7 ) . 
  i wonder if the swiss number includes the military rifles their conscripts keep in home or if it 's just privately owned guns like in finland . 
  also similarly interesting is comparing homicide numbers and percentages , i counted the missing total number . 
  finland : 24 homicides with firearm , 19.8 % of all ( total 121 ) switzerland : 57 homicides with firearm , 72.2 % of all ( total 79 ) my conclusion is that it seems in finland we are a bit more homicidal , but still traditionally prefer bladed weapons to firearms even with the prevalence of them . 
  sickle and hammer :o i did n't knew that . 
  and they seem to have them already [ in 1919 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_austria#symbolism ) when soviet union took them officially [ only 1924 .
