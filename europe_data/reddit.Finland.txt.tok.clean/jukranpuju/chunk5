  each of baltic countries already [ have one agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agencies_of_the_european_union ) , so maybe you thought about croatia in balkans which does n't have any agency yet . 
  i mean although there are bigger eu-countries with multiple agencies small baltic countries sound a little bit odd choice . 
  [ this site ] ( https://market-scope.com/breaking-post/brexit-vote-may-lead-to-relocation-of-ema-new-regulatory-hurdles-for-ophthalmic-firms/ ) claims that also italy tries to grab ema after brexit . 
  edit : and [ sweden and denmark ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-vote-sets-off-race-to-seat-ema/ ) seemed to be interested as well, 
  there was this really dumb kid who was egged on to shat his pants by mean elder kids . 
  they 've told him that teacher will let him out of classroom and he does n't have to take the test he has n't studied , if he does it . 
  he told us , his class mates about his plan and we warned him not to do that and it 's not worth it . 
  then he did it anyway and i never forget his stupid face when he sat there looking satisfied to himself and stinking high heaven . 
  of course the teacher threw him out as soon as she found out what he has done . 
  another face worth of remembrance is how pathetic he looked next day when he was told that was expelled from the school after they learned that he has soiled his pants on purpose . 
  what will happen the two eu agencies that are in london at the moment : [ eba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_banking_authority ) ( european banking authority ) and [ ema ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_medicines_agency ) ( european medicines agency ) , i assume they have to be relocated to some other countries and their british workers lose their jobs ? 
   no english speaking country left , what about [ ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_ireland ) and [ malta , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_malta ) in both of those countries english language has an official status . 
  if you really think about it , at least in recent history , the prevalence of english proficiency in the countries where the main language is something else , has not been because of just uk but also usa , canada , australia etc. 
  conveniently uk just happened to be also one of those countries . 
   is there a permit that allows europeans to store a firearms in a car for self defence ? 
  if your professions is a jewellery courier and you routinely carry diamonds worth of hundreds thousands $ , you might get get a permit to carry also a firearm , but strictly only when you are doing your job and you 're not supposed to keep a gun in your car for heavens sake , that 's not safe place for keeping a firearm . 
  you can get firearm permit for hunting , target practice you could even be a gun collector but generally you ca n't get gun permit for self defense purposes without well proven reasons . 
  now this is a bit grey area , let 's say that you are on the route to your gun related hobbies when somebody armed with lethal weapon attempts to harm you or anybody . 
  in that case you might have a justified cause to shoot that attacker with the gun you just in fortunate coincidence happen to have with you . 
  to survive legal hurdles unscathed afterwards you probably had to prove that it was really a coincidence and you were really going or returning your gun related hobbies also that you did n't had loaded weapon with you but you had to remove your weapon from the bag , open the trigger lock and load it before shooting . 
  that all also happened while you were constantly under lethal threat you could n't escape anyway by leaving . 
  that kind of explanation or situation sounds quite unlikely and implausible as a self defense , although it might fly better if it was for defending somebody else . 
   typo for `` third world '' in that context turkey as a nato member was certainly a first world country . 
  even iran , angola , mozambique , namibia and rhodesia ( zimbabwe ) were included to 1st world , while austria , ireland , finland , sweden and switzerland were 3rd world . 
  however after ending of cold war in my understand those terms have mutated to mean : * 1st world - industrialized even post-industrialized countries with full democracy , minimal issues in civil liberties * 2nd world - industrialized countries with flawed democracy and issues with civil liberties * 3rd world - not yet fully industrialized , not democracies and serious issues with civil liberties it 's possible to argue that turkey was at the brink of becoming a 1st world country in that modern parlance before erdogan . 
  they had some issues they could have resolved , if they 've wanted , but they did n't do that . 
  that 's why eastern european countries that after the cold war were initially poorer than turkey , but were willing to correct their issues became eu members and are usually considered as 1st world countries . 
  tl ; dr eu is a club for 1st world countries in modern parlance , turkey is not 1st world because of democracy issues . 
  [ offical videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/visitfinland/featured ) of finnish tourism board perhaps [ one of the best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ) of unoffilcial ones, 
  i do n't think there are yet any proven order or even correspondence with any known terrorist groups at least in boston marathon , san bernardino or orlando cases , so in that sense they 're all lone wolves . 
  also where they put islamists in political map , like they are certainly not in the left although the political left for some incomprehensible reason tries to court with islam . 
  but [ radler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shandy#radler ) is not budweiser . 
   authentic budweisers you might get [ authentic budweisers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_budvar_brewery ) in germany , however it comes from czechia . 
  urban dictionary definitions of [ `` nev '' ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nev ), 
  ftfy  because homo and `` err ... dog anus '', 
  there was no explanation how they get caught as illegals , but assuming many of them got caught because of crime , could germany pay the cost of their prison time to morocco . 
  there is no incentive to receive someone who has already committed a crime and may possibly do it again , but sending them back to serve their sentence with money to the government might be more lucrative proposition . 
  germany pays the same money it costs to hold them in german prison , sends them back and leaves rest to moroccan officials . 
  even if they got released earlier than what they 'd do in germany does n't matter , because deportation is more important issue . 
  `` calamares en su tinta '' is not so bad , but eating tripes is not limited only in balkan area . 
  i once adventured choosing ` plato del dia ' which included ` callos ' as a lunch in spain . 
  food consisted pale flat 2x2 cm rubbery squares in tomato sauce . 
  when chewing my canine teeth together i hardly managed to make a small hole of those devil squares . 
  i 'm not usually a picky eater , most of those other foods in the map do n't sound so bad and i 've even tasted many , like what 's wrong with the horse steak ? 
  however since then the name ` callos ' was imprinted in fire letters in my brain and i wo n't make same mistake ever again . 
  i guess in ostrobothnia [ `` juhannuskokko '' ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/juhannuskokko ) ~ midsummer bonfire is still not so common as in rest of the finland . 
  uncountable number of [ bonfires ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2tinqjefqw ) in every lake shore . 
  some kind of festivities in every rural village where people have their summer cottages . 
  however big cities like helsinki will become ghostly empty like they were targets of biological warfare or something . 
  lol no it was a typo , ' \u00e4 ' is under ' \u00e5 ' . 
  vegetation in denmark differs somewhat from what it is finland , sweden and norway so that might be a good idea . 
  however as far i know they have n't made any final decisions of patterns yet , so even common pattern with more northern countries might still be possible . 
  i mean camo patterns of [ norway ] ( http://www.camopedia.org/index.php?title=norway ) and [ sweden ] ( http://www.camopedia.org/index.php?title=sweden ) are quite old and not exactly multicam compared to [ finnish ] ( http://www.camopedia.org/index.php?title=finland ) so some kind of compromise in that detail would probably reduce costs per unit . 
   sometimes we use `` albanian '' to refer to something slavic but is n't that a misconception because [ albanian language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_language#linguistic_affinities ) is not a south slavic language like many others in balkan region . 
  it seems that our armies [ will be wearing the same uniform ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finland_to_plan_joint_nordic_military_uniform/8958649 ) in a couple of years . 
  i 'd assume that camo pattern might resemble closely the same pattern finnish defence forces have at the moment because fdf has studied that detail for longest time . 
  sweden might have something to give for cut and ergonomics because of [ snickers workwear ] ( http://www.snickersworkwear.se/ ) and [ bl\u00e4kl\u00e4der ] ( https://www.blaklader.se/sv ) and boots might come from [ sievi ] ( http://www.sievi.com/se ) or [ ejendals/jalas . 
  ] ( http://www.ejendals.com/sv/jalas/?mls=sv# ) i would n't rule out that they will have that same uniform also in baltic countries at least in estonia ( ~ ~ almost ~ ~ nordics by that day ? ), 
  e-citizenship programs might be also the reason why estonia is in shared 9th position with germany ( both 8.82 ) , above france , belgium and of course all the eastern europe . 
  with just a 0.01 more and it would have been colored with the same tint as uk , sweden ireland and luxembourg . 
   orebro mosk\u00e9s leadership accused the imam of the neighboring town of eskilstuna for extremism that description seems to fit with [ this man . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fida_al-sayed ) is he the one they talking about ? 
  that 's exactly the reason why i tried to formulate my post a bit ambiguous . 
   if he right now kills me in front police he will not go to jail . 
  because he has allegedly already killed one person [ his brother ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infante_alfonso_of_spain#death_and_burial ) by accident , it makes that law kind of macabre . 
  in finland the oldest part of the legislation is from 1734 when finland was the same country with sweden . 
  there are still applicable law [ `` how pigs should let in the groves to eat acorns '' . 
  ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1734/17340002000#l12 ) what happens if somebody willfully lets his pigs in his neighbors grove to eat acorns ( owner of grove can take them as his own ) and if they come by themselves and the owner of grove kills or hits them . 
  there is a saying in finland if somebody gets beaten really bad , he was `` hit like a stranger 's pig '' , which probably comes from that law . 
  as a curiosity finland is too north for oak to properly thrive here and there are only few oak groves mostly in the southern coast . 
  [ same law ] ( https://lagen.nu/1736:0123_1#k12 ) exists still also in sweden and comparing it with the [ swedish version of finnish law ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/1734/17340002000?search[type]=pika&amp;search[pika]=byggninga%20balk#l12 ) it seems there are some differences like we have edited different parts . 
  there are also directions about [ bee swarms . 
  ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1734/17340002000#l21 ) if the owner of bees follows his bees into the woods that does n't belong to him , marks the tree they set in and tells about it to the `` men of village '' he can fell the tree and take his bees in case the tree is not protected or fruit carrying one . 
  how found bees should be shared between the owner of the woods and the finder . 
  also quite likely non-existing reference to the penal code about the crime of taking the bees from woods without announcing the owner or `` seducing '' them with the food or bait . 
  why , i mean sperm counts of the finnish men are significantly higher compared with the danish men [ according the studies . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10633221 ), 
  what about [ angry birds livery ] ( http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/angry-birds-plane-2011.jpg ) of finnair . 
  although i 'm not sure if choosing subject that crashes against buildings is really the right choice for the air carrier . 
   they copied our national anthem that 's actually just the reason why we as finns should keep it . 
  besides in estonia the same tune is used also in [ the anthem of livonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/min_iz%c4%81m%c5%8d ) which even little bit more strengthens it 's position . 
  that 's the most convincing argument for their admittance i 've ever heard . 
  that does n't look like [ mineral water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dakfr0ztzcy ), 
  [ we sure do . 
  in finland there is this recently released [ salty licorice flavored mineral water ] ( http://mb.cision.com/public/1196/9931268/be620f579769bd8e_800x800ar.jpg ) and it might divide opinions . 
  that kind of recruitment as those salafis tried to do , should be made illegal if it 's not yet so . 
  informing local officials about them and if they get caught and convicted should provide some perks to the informant like accelerated handling of his case and refugee status , if he otherwise has impeccable background . 
  fifth column who are already in europe and have some residence status even citizenship are the most dangerous kind of characters who should be locked up and isolated from the normal population and helping officials to do that is a valuable favor that should be rewarded . 
  today there were also yet [ another wildlife incident ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000001191608.html ) concerning the young bear who was seen in porvoo about 60 km east from helsinki . 
  alert was given to the locals who were advised to be careful and look out if they were in outdoors . 
  according the finnish [ source ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000001191882.html ) police was reported about two moose walking in one of the main highways that lead northward from helsinki . 
  police stopped traffic but one of the moose had already caused an accident and injured , so one of the motorcycle officers had to put it to death in arabia neighborhood in helsinki . 
  there is no information about the destiny of the other moose yet . 
  meat collected from the moose shot in the [ previous incident ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4l75wp/meanwhile_in_finland_helsinki_a_moose_breaks_into/ ) will be [ auctioned tomorrow ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/a1464744817287 ) by helsinki wildlife management association and parts with lesser value like hooves were already donated to the lions in helsinki zoo . 
  or at least claim to be to children , because they 've heard that being a minor might have positive effect for the decision and acceptance of their asylum application . 
   non - ** martial ** fertility ratio there is a theory about the effects of warfare to human sex ratio . 
  normally [ sex ratio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_sex_ratio#natural_ratio ) in birth is something like 1.06 but it balances later on because higher mortality of males . 
  however in the areas affected by wars the proportion of born males is alleged to be higher than normal . 
  so i thought this thread might have something to do with that phenomenon . 
  a ) `` free lunch '' could mean that an entrepreneur for example cafe owner gets more customers than his competitor because of the free wi-fi .
