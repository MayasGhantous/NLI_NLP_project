  so while his main product still cost the same as his competitor , the added customer volume covers better the overhead including also the free wi-fi and he makes more profit . 
  c ) free wi-fi should be a separate network than the it-infrastructure which is used for company environment . 
   when it comes to muslims , it is complicated . 
  iranians are muslims , yet have done well both in terms of economics but also culture . 
  the same can be said for indonesians , kazakhstanis , malaysians and other muslims . 
  explanation : * iranians - 95 % shias , inoculated against carcinogenic salafi influence * indonesians - 87 % islam , although sunni further away from influence of ksa and gulf emirates , shafi'i not salafists * kazakhstanis - 70 % islam , although sunni further away from influence of ksa and gulf emirates , hanafi not salafists * malaysians - 61 % islam , although sunni further away from influence of ksa and gulf emirates , shafi'i not salafists, 
  not a bad suggestion , but i still think think that [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eatisifhaeg ) could be the epitome of finnishness ,, 
  lol , of course it depends how often you think it happens , but there seem to be similar cases maybe not in every year but still more than once in a decade . 
  the reason for that is they 've inadvertently created perfect conditions for it to be happen . 
  the shape of the helsinki central park resembles funnel which spout ends in the middle of the city . 
  there are moose living in the northern part of central park and when the separation of calves happens if they start to wander in southward they can walk all the way to the center of helsinki where the park ends and abruptly they are in the close vicinity of [ the parliament house ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_house,_helsinki ) and [ the national museum of finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_museum_of_finland ) , in the heart of helsinki . 
  in fact the name of the street `` museokatu '' , means `` museum street '' and comes from the national museum . 
  now as a helsinkian i 'm not worried about moose , but every once in while there are also rumors of bear dung found in [ the nuuksio national park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuuksio_national_park ) ... , 
  moose running wild in the center of helsinki are not even so rare event as one could think . 
  last time similar occurrence happened just two years ago [ june 2014 . 
  ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/a1305834623906 ) early summer is the time when moose cows abandon their almost full-grown calves who then start wander around . 
  [ helsinki central park ] ( http://www.hel.fi/hel2/keskuspuisto/eng/1centralpark/# ) stretches in the south to the heart of city and is connected to the forests in the north , so that 's the route they use without anybody stopping them . 
  su resultado es : aprobado approved , i take that as a good result considering that i have n't ever actually studied spanish and did n't even use any on-line translator , just trying to guess what is asked . 
  what does that mean , could i now become austrian ? 
  i got same 92 % ( failed the driving license and flag questions ), 
  that was actually pretty hard , considering how much i have forgotten german language , although i have studied it five years . 
  they all have blue eyes so they do n't fit to the stereotype . 
  even 7 , the swarthiest one could be just tanning salon abuser . 
  there were a [ retaliation attacks ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/retaliation-attacks-in-cologne-as-hooligan-gangs-launch-foreigner-manhunt ) which victims were most likely innocent for anything that happened during nye . 
  while the average german man might be inexperienced to deal with violence there are certainly groups like this [ `` hooligans against salafists '' ] ( http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/german-football-hooligans-take-battle-against-salafists ) , who probably wait and hope for the opportunity to use violence . 
  because nye was the first time something like that happened , nobody could predict it . 
  if there comes a date they expect something similar to happen those group might also congregate and then clashes are inevitable . 
  climate in norway is quite rainy and cloudy , but [ scandinavian mountains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_mountains ) cut lot of the rain coming to east from them , so sweden and finland are at least less cloudy than norway . 
  uv-radiation while inducing production of vitamin d in skin is also damaging in longer doses . 
  that 's why hairless human beings who do n't have dark skin have to protect themselves from it with clothing in southern latitudes . 
  even in the north it 's surprisingly short time one must spend under the direct sunlight to achieve that vitamin d production . 
  sufficient amount of direct sunlight for pale skintype is as low as 15 minutes at noon thrice a week during summer and wearing a t-shirt is adequate amount of exposed skin . 
  because her skin does n't product vitamin d as effectively as the skin of native ethnic swedes she probably should stay a bit longer under the sunlight but the similar amount of exposed skin does n't feel exorbitant . 
  it depends of definition , in that same article there is also chapter about [ daytime duration . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunshine_duration#daytime_duration ) `` places on the arctic circle have the longest total annual daytime , 4,647 hours '' and `` the equator has a total daytime of 4,422 hours per year . 
   region that gets the lowest amount of sunlight in the world that 's not true , the amount of sunlight during the course of the year is about the same all over the world . 
  might be even little bit higher in sweden than in some sandbox country where the dust scatters the light while pure uncontaminated air does n't do that . 
  it just divided differently . 
  in stockholm at the midsummer there is 18 hours long day , something like 2 hours of twilight for dawn and dusk , and only 4 hours of darkness for the night . 
  at the christmastime then , the lengths of day and night are opposite . 
  however if she wastes the sunlight of the summer by staying indoors and wearing clothing that have sun protection factor appropriate for vampire who tries not to get burn , she 's bound to get problems in the winter . 
  literacy was one of the requirement for christian wedding back then in our countries [ according the law .

  baby 's nationality is determined by the nationality of the parents , in practice by mothers . 
  in europe all countries grant citizenship by [ jus sanguinis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) with some exceptions , instead of [ jus soli .

  most of the african countries 30 out of 54 are ** less corrupt ** than russia . 
  although romanian words are closer to italian words , how it sounds resembles in some way like portuguese mixed with some slavic language , not necessarily russian, 
  day by day russia seems to resemble more and more to the former soviet union and going back to its habits . 
  that 's because swedes have n't found [ falun mine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_copper_mountain ) yet at that time . 
  after finding it there was no need for imported copper anymore . 
  writer of the article has huffed too much jenkem to get that idea . 
  actually right now is the time when new [ shoots of spruce ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lkshqhgru0s/t2hiypahpri/aaaaaaaadps/7-kfrkx3a80/s1600/kuusenkerkki%c3%a4.jpg ) are at their best and they are [ tasty .

  amount of caffeine per weight depends of the shade of roasting . 
  lighter the roast , the more there is caffeine . 
  because of inherent acidity of the light roast , only the best arabica beans which are less acidic than inferior quality beans are used for light roast coffee blends . 
  only other people who drink similar light roasted coffee as finns are the ** people of northern sweden ** . 
  light roast masterrace !, 
  there was a thread of that same subject recently also in finnish subreddit / r/suomi and one user mentioned to heard it called as `` pillupuhelin '' ~ `` pussy phone '' . 
  of course , the idea that there is some improper time for sex is absurd in sexually liberated nordic countries . 
  that might be because it 's not common discussion topic , but i ensure that at least i and majority of persons when that topic has arisen claimed to use them exactly for the purpose they were designed . 
  you should try , cleaner feeling and goodbye to skidmarks . 
  finnish bathrooms in apartment buildings are usually quite small . 
  if there is extra space available , it is used for building a sauna ( finnish priorities lol ), 
  in finland as long as there is a handwash basin next to the toilet bowl there is almost certainly also a [ bidet shower . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bidet_shower ), 
  then again up here in finland we have properly insulated houses with district heating , ** triple ** glazed windows and bidet showers . 
  however we do n't have wall-to-wall carpeting in bathrooms but proper underfloor heating and instead of separate taps for cold and hot water , we have single lever mixers . 
  bidet showers are definitely frequent and ubiquitous in finland . 
  only places one may not see them are public toilets with multiple stalls which have no handwash basins because they require faucet to control temperature . 
  in private homes if the bathroom is built or renovated during the last 30 years there is almost certainly [ this kind ] ( http://www.taloon.com/kuvat/k/oras/kasisuihku_oras_bidetta_242050_kromi.jpg ) of [ oras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oras_%28company%29 ) bidetta showerhead or it 's older incarnation between the basin and the toilet bowl ( they might be even in the building code nowadays ) . 
  oras used to have somewhat [ cringeworthy advertising ] ( http://koti.kapsi.fi/watchman/avotakka.jpg ) for them in the 70 's but it seems that did n't hinder their adoption and becoming popular . 
  by comparing maps , there might be some kind of correlation with [ dubbing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qpqzfh3.png ) and [ english proficiency index .

  instead of solar panels the more probable option is engine-generator they could use to charge batteries of lap-tops , cell phones etc. 
  they run [ sled dog safari business , ] ( http://www.scanadventures.co.uk/blog/blonde-dog-whisperer ) so they have to have some means to communicate with their potential customers . 
  they have [ sled dog safari business , ] ( http://www.visitfinland.com/article/call-of-the-wild-tinja-and-her-dogs/ ) so they are probably not so isolated as that article makes it look . 
  they meet new people as customers when they run their business and finance their lifestyle . 
  i believe that the kids in the upper row , judging from their clothing are in fact [ komi people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/komi_people ) who speak language which is related to finnish . 
  in the middle row the 3rd pic from left is finnish folk music band [ v\u00e4rttin\u00e4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4rttin%c3%a4 ) , 4th pic [ samu haber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samu_haber ) vocalist of finnish band sunrise avenue and 6th of course [ kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kimi_r%c3%a4ikk%c3%b6nen ) f1 driver . 
  it 's originally german song called [ `` der lachende vagabund '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7uppgxb2po ), 
  if one is deported from a schengen country , it should mean a ban for getting a schengen visa . 
  airlines do n't take passengers without visa to their destination in a flight . 
  if a person without visa comes to eu border control by some other means of transport , there is an information of the ban in a database that includes biometric identifiers , finger prints etc. 
  crime accusations are not a reason for asylum , on the contrary , eu is not safe haven for criminals . 
  if we ca n't properly control the outer border of schengen area , we should bring back the border controls between countries . 
  no political group involved just medical . 
  refusal of repatriation of their own citizen leads to untenable situation that 's why the countermeasure against it must be as harsh even hostile . 
  they hold the key to solve the problem and could easily remove those countermeasures by just doing the right thing . 
  that 's about coolest skyrim character name ever . 
  talvikki is pre-christian female name which means `` winterborn '' or plant [ wintergreen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyrola ) and `` kontio '' means bear . 
  in finland expecting woman must apply permit to get abortion . 
  almost any reason is acceptable ( all medical reasons including the mental state , too young , too old , ca n't afford , not planned etc. 
  only reason i know , permit is denied is the gender of fetus ) . 
  in practice abortion is legal and free , only threshold is that expecting woman must somehow reason and explain why she wants abortion , so it 's not `` no question asked '' like in some other countries . 
  [ nallikari , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nallikari ) riviera of [ finnmarkings . 
   those in power ( and their families ) are first in line for the visas anyway ban their entry completely as long as they refuse repatriation . 
  count the number of annually approved schengen visas from the country that refuses accepting their citizens , that would be the baseline of the annual visa quota from that country . 
  every refusal diminishes that quota with multiplier of 100 .
