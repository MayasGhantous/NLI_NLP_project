  then for example 15 refusals means 1500 less people can travel to eu . 
  if quota becomes full , no visas are approved anymore without any exceptions . 
  next year quota will be based to number of previous year . 
  interestingly there were no nordic countries at all and our `` almost nordic '' brothers estonians win the category of `` hard to tell '' . 
  [ beltane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beltane ) ( celts ) and [ walpurgis night or vappu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walpurgis_night#finland ) ( nordics ) like we called in finland , would be better considering the weather at least here in north . 
  we would n't mind rest of the europe `` appropriating '' our `` vappu '' traditions . 
  there was a [ proposition ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/tunnuslause ) back in 1936 to add hendiatris * `` vapaa vankka vakaa '' * ( free sturdy stable ) to the coat of arms of finland . 
  afaik they 've partially solved the problem with some kind of mechanism that drops sand on tracks to increase friction . 
  i believe that just brushing off the crushed leaves is not enough because there are oils and [ saponines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saponin ) in leaves that still remain in tracks though brushing might alleviate problem . 
  yes there certainly are even in my city helsinki . 
  i just wanted to point out the fact that leafy trees are `` natural enemies '' of rail transport in couple of weeks in a year during the leaf fall . 
  here in helsinki they 've gone such lengths that they 've changed some tram routes from such boulevards with trees and turn the middle lane where tracks used be as bike lanes . 
  although pretty , that looks like a [ tram driver 's nightmare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slippery_rail ) at autumn when the leaves fall and grind slippery slime between wheels and rails . 
  i wonder what they do to mitigate `` leaves on the line '' . 
  in english , they have `` false spring '' which means the unusually warm spell in the end of winter . 
  like we had false spring and now winter is back . 
  also there is [ strawberry spring ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=strawberry%20spring ) but that might not be a real expression . 
  of course swedes were occupiers and finnish speakers and finnish language did n't have equal stand as swedish . 
  how can you even deny it ? 
  it seems that [ we 've been fighting almost incessantly once a decade at least thousand years ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_suomen_historian_sodista ) and quite often in our own land , so that might leave some marks in the culture . 
  because she implies that those alcohol related problems in finland are different than alcohol related problems in sweden and norway and are consequence of our culture . 
  do you really think that the availability of more expensive craft beers in grocery stores leads to more alcohol related murders ? 
  we are in grave danger because after the change of legislation when also the 5,5 % abv beers could be bought in grocery stores instead the ones that only have 4,7 % abv and we do n't have to go state owned liqueur store to buy those stronger ones anymore . 
  craft beer enthusiasts turn homicidal maniacs because they can buy their more expensive beverage from an ordinary grocery store . 
  about the differences , i guess we do n't [ pour champagne in a sink ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_\\ ( behavior \\ ) ) that 's something only you do . 
  because it 's patronizing and it 's not her business to be concerned about our drinking habits anyway , like our legislators did n't understand what they are doing . 
  i doubt that there are any real differences between the drinking habits of those three nordic countries , except artificial because of pricing . 
  finland has always had slightly lower prices than sweden and norway . 
  how could liberating the legislation about the availability of the craft beers , which will be still even after the change more expensive than normal , lead to the binge drinking ? 
  magdalena gerger is a racist who has stereotypical ideas about us and mistakenly believes that the former colonial power could still dictate our legislation . 
  edit : she compares swedish and norwegian drinking habits to finnish and claims that there are differences because of finnish culture . 
  [ is this better ? 
  how large should a wineyard be to considered as `` a proper wineyard '' ? 
  there is this one in [ lerkek\u00e5sa , norway ] ( http://lerkekasa.no/ ) and even little bit further north test plantation in [ olkiluoto , finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#agriculture ) where they use the cooling water of nuclear plant for warming the soil . 
  there was also this man [ arvo ylpp\u00f6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arvo_ylpp%c3%b6 ) who is considered beloved national hero and whose input to the pediatric medicine in finland is invaluable . 
  area marked for italy would have probably been ceded to greece after wwii like also the international territory and if kurds have got their own land , they would have quite likely inherited areas marked as british and french . 
  sicle and hammer ( communism ? ), 
  and `` russia '' written in pseudo cyrillic letters . 
  [ so did we , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillage_of_sigtuna ) might have been done that with you and estonians . 
  also retaliated by [ hanging their king . 
  however without the products and contribution of one [ dutch company ] ( http://www.technivorm.com/ ) i doubt if we would still be in the 1st position .

  finland ( also iceland ) differs the other nordic countries because in here abortion is regulated . 
  there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled before the permit will be allowed . 
  however because one of those conditions is catch all `` societal reasons '' , in practice anyone will get that permit . 
  ( one of the illegal reasons is sex-selective abortion ) 2 . 
  before 12 . week woman 's own doctor can write permit . 
  after that until the 20 . week there is special board in [ `` valvira '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_supervisory_authority_for_welfare_and_health_\\ ( finland \\ ) ) that decides if permit will be allowed . 
  in case of fetal defect even 24 . week could be applicable . 
  in finland there is publicly funded universal healthcare with modest out-of-pocket fees . 
  cost of abortion is similar than some other procedures that take same time . 
  low income women could get their bills reimbursed by [ `` kela '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kela_\\ ( finnish_institution \\ ) ) ( finnish social insurance institution ) 4 . 
  according the law , husband or father of child ( not ) to be has right to be heard and express an opinion of the matter . 
  however his opinion is not binding or crucial . 
  i do n't know if i 'd like to change anything in our current system to make it better . 
  there has been speculations if sonography or some other means has been used in some cases to determine the gender of fetus before decision of abortion . 
  however denying abortion because of that kind of suspicions if woman states otherwise could lead the use of unsafe and illegal abortions , so it does n't necessarily help anything . 
  yes , somehow that seems to be quite import trait when we elect our presidents , also they should be frugal . 
  our previous president [ dumpster diving ] ( https://aller-seiska-prod-cdn.seiska.fi/files/styles/article_page_image_770px_wide/s3/styles/web/pannu-inline.jpg?itok=78chwsrc ) with some other folks ( she was n't anymore in office at the time when that picture was taken ) . 
  according the rumors , one of her predecessors used to darn his socks . 
  i once happened to leave at the same time as him from the public library and wait the same tram with him at the tram stop , not that we discussed or anything . 
  that happened after his presidency and he had n't any aide or body guard with him . 
  that picture was taken couple of decades ago . 
  nowadays he manages to look goofy and derpy , also he does lot of ordinary humble stuff , so he could be excused .

  yes , that castle seems to be built after the fall of roman empire . 
  it 's just that the coins are objects with inscription . 
  however there are also other kind of objects without inscription that are believed to be made in roman empire and transported all the way to japan at the time when roman empire was still thriving .

  i guess [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_sunday_\\ ( 1972 \\ ) ) could be certainly counted as an atrocity . 
  however the number of deaths in that incident did n't reach in the same level as those ones that were listed in the article . 
  i assume that 's because irish famine happened 1800 's while those other atrocities happened 1900 's . 
  except for boer concentration camps and amritsar massacre , there are still living people who might have actually experienced and survived those atrocities .
