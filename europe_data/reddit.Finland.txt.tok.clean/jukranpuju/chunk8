  [ this ] ( http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/om-oss/for-dig-i-skolan/sprak-for-dig-i-skolan/spraken-i-sverige/meankieli.html ) swedish source claims the number of me\u00e4nkieli speakers in sweden about 40000 . 
  in norway [ kvensk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kven_language ) has similar officially recognized minority language status . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.kvenskinstitutt.no/kvener/nasjonale-minoriterer/ ) norwegian source claims the number of kvensk speakers about 2000 - 8000 . 
  largest concentration of kvensk speakers are probably around the town of [ vads\u00f8 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vads%c3%b8 ) in finnmark . 
  you should consider adding finnish speaker striping for [ me\u00e4nmaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/me%c3%a4nmaa ) and some parts of [ finnmark . 
  then why [ me\u00e4nmaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/me%c3%a4nmaa ) in sweden is not also striped ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there are still more me\u00e4nkieli speakers than speakers of sami dialects . 
  similar striping could be made also for some areas of [ finnmark . 
  in fact back in the days nokia used to be one of the toilet paper manufacturers . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gdnm0ml.jpg ) is their logo from that time painted on a toilet paper dispenser . 
  finland is a major producer of toilet paper . 
  however we respect our forests and rather see them used for some more noble purposes than an asswipe . 
  that 's why we are already trying to live in the post toilet paper world or at least time we do n't need to use it anymore such large quantities as earlier . 
  as a neighboring country , you are early adapters in our plan for world domination . 
  finland and sweden also share one [ small skerry .

  still neutral in a sense that they are not members of military alliances ( nato ) while eu is considered primarily as an economic union although later on some military defence aspects were included .

  can somebody explain , why there is a picture of david bowie in the thumbnail of this article ?

   when all of the hot water is gone :o you ca n't complain even to them , because that wo n't ever happen . 
  the idea of hot water running out in district heating systems because of normal use or even unusual use is entirely preposterous . 
  in worst case there could be couple of hours of outages once in a decade because of maintenance or failure . 
   it performs very well on short and crude runways , which there are a lot of in the wilderness of finland .

  in metropolitan area of helsinki , there are two national parks , [ nuuksio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuuksio_national_park ) and [ sipoonkorpi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sipoonkorpi_national_park ) , one can reach with local buses . 
  besides them also [ central park of helsinki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_park_\\ ( helsinki \\ ) ) is 10 km long wedge shaped park , which tip comes all the way to downtown of helsinki , almost to the parliament house .

  it seems that we finns got the place [ where potato is originated , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potato ) however now latvians got the place with [ vast deposits of guano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caliche#chilean_caliche ) so they could become number one exporter of potassium instead of kazakhstan . 
  now , i do n't want to rain on your parade , but check first some info about the [ atacama desert .

  i consider ravel 's bolero to be more suitable for [ something else ... ] ( http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2016/12/05/ravel-bolero ), 
  i guess that 's a bit unfair against the good people of lithuania , because in finland [ kouvola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kouvola )  town itself being infamous for its soviet-like brutalist architecture and allegedly high crime rate so there are memes like [ this .

  finland 's former president [ tarja halonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarja_halonen#personal_life ) ( in office 2000 - 2012 ) is not a member of evangelical lutheran church of finland like most of the finns . 
  she left the church already in the 60 's . 
  she might not be an atheist , but at least her lack of religiosity did n't hinder any way her getting elected and re-elected . 
  in a similar manner at least former prime minister of norway [ jens stoltenberg , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jens_stoltenberg#personal_life ) former prime minister of sweden [ fredrik reinfeldt , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fredrik_reinfeldt#personal_opinions&gt; ) and former prime minister of denmark [ helle thorning-schmidt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helle_thorning-schmidt#religious_beliefs ) are not members of the churches of their respecting countries . 
  lack of religiosity of the head of the state is just not an issue in nordic countries . 
  on the contrary the ones who publicly state that their religious belief affect their decisions quite likely did n't even have a chance to get elected . 
  we just kept the old agricultural names of months . 
  about half them when translated are the same and in the same place as in the [ germanic calendar .

   it 's not rocket science ... 
  shouting `` allahu ackbar '' and attacking with a knife against a soldier who has an assault rifle makes him a terrorist without a shadow of a doubt . 
  however they did n't call him a rocket scientist ... 
  it 's more like your defeat is `` casualty of war '' in our rivalry with sweden . 
  we do n't intentionally try to win you but swedes . 
  in finland 's point of view there is no rivalry against the netherlands . 
  only other country we check in these kind of comparisons is sweden and if we are above them . 
  as long as we win sweden , we could n't care less if netherlands beats us . 
  in modern parlance full-auto capable gun is called a machine gun only if it 's belt fed . 
  if it has magazine and it uses intermediate cartridge it 's an assault rifle , if it uses full-power cartridge it 's a battle rifle . 
  usually there is no need for full-auto capability against single human target , however it certainly comes handy if the target is something like a moving vehicle which should be stopped . 
  you meant that [ whippet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pgzvaet.jpg ), 
  however french coat of arms seems to be `` totally fascist '' . 
  at the moment [ romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_reactors#romania ) seems to be only country in eu , which has operational pressurized heavy-water reactor , which might be the [ easiest route ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pressurized_heavy-water_reactor#nuclear_proliferation ) for producing weapon-grade plutonium . 
  so perhaps they should build the bomb for us . 
   that romanian [ cernavod\u0103 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cernavod%c4%83_nuclear_power_plant ) reactor seems to have rather interesting and peculiar history . 
  like it 's building started 1982 , during ceausescu days , while romania was a [ comecon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comecon ) member and it 's still based on canadian technology instead of soviet one . 
  relationship with romania and soviet union at that time where not the warmest one , so they might have had some ulterior motives when they made that order from canadians . 
  in the end of [ that article  ( https://theawakezone.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/the-swedish-nuclear-weapons/ )  no one seems to know what ever happened to the first swedish nuclear bombs that were actually made . 
  because there were surely some made !, 
  are they still there ? 
  at those times here in finland we had also [ one uranium mine ] ( http://uraanitieto.tormunet.fi/colpaert_kirjoittajan.pdf ) which produced about 27 tons of uranium ore concentrate ( 20 -- 30 % purity ) , which was then sold to sweden . 
  why pick germany as the one country who were given the nuclear weapons capability of the eu ? 
  should n't it rather be some other less threatening country which do n't have similar burden from historical perspective ? 
  rarely mentioned piece of information is that also sweden used to have their own secret [ nuclear weapon program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_nuclear_weapons_program ) which supposedly even advanced to the point of underground testing phase and was discarded only 1966 . 
  just for the sake of argument , i wonder what kind of consequences would it cause if it was revealed that against contradicting information sweden had run through that program and nowadays have operational nuclear weapons . 
  or better yet , if countries like iran or north korea are considered to be capable to producing nuclear weapons , i 'd assume that any eu country which have some kind of heavy industry could be as well capable to do the same . 
  that 's miss hong kong , miss finland is the middle one who has the crown of a winner .

  i wonder what is the red dot in japan that should be avoided , fukushima ? 
  she creates a straw man of some imaginary swedish person , who `` in the spirit of understanding '' allegedly said to her that there is some legitimate other side in charlie hebdo terrorist attack who we should understand . 
  in other words , people in the sweden should discard the free speech when it comes to subjects that may hurt religious feelings of muslim immigrants if they want avoid similar terrorism related incidences .

  ( it is certain that there has to be many other similar places , but they have no measuring station ), 
  yes , that 's in a borderline , although even that is a muddled by the spelling like it 's supposed to be `` juma-lauta '' instead of `` jumal ' - auta '' . 
  they are all more like [ minced oaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minced_oath ) and do n't even mean anything .
