  cold spell ended and now it 's +2 \u00b0 c in helsinki, 
  that might be , but it makes even less sense . 
  i mean after all at least charlemagne was a christian , while month names in julian calendar include pagan roman gods and emperors . 
  these words are all euphemistic mild profanities , not a real ones like ` perkele ' . 
  interestingly half of finnish months ' names mean exactly the same as the names in [ germanic calendar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_calendar#modern ) which was introduced by charlemagne . 
  for example : * june - old high german ` br\u0101h-m\u0101nod ' - finnish [ kes\u00e4 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kes%c3%a4 ) kuu ~ ` fallow month ' * july - old high german ` hewi-m\u0101nod ' - finnish [ hein\u00e4 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hein%c3%a4 ) kuu ~ ` hay month ' * august - old high german ` aran-m\u0101nod ' - finnish [ elo ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elo#finnish ) kuu ~ ` harvest month ' * september - old high german ` witu-m\u0101nod ' - finnish [ syys ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syys ) kuu ~ ` autumn month ' * arguably also november - dutch ` slachtmaand ' ~ ` slaughter month ' - finnish [ marras ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marras#finnish ) kuu ~ ` death month ' * december - dutch ` joelmaand ' ~ ` yule month ' - finnish [ joulu ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/joulu ) kuu ~ ` yule month ' for some incomprehensible reason other europeans regressed back to ancient roman julian months ' names , while finns kept on using more modern and meaningful old agricultural months ' names . 
  we still reminisce those days of [ `` hakkapeliittas '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) in [ the lyrics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bj%c3%b6rneborgarnas_marsch#lyrics_in_english ) of '' [ porilaisten marssi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdkm0u3lvc ) '' , which is honorary march of finnish defence forces and president of finland . 
  also in [ lyrics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliittain_marssi#literal_english_translation ) of the [ march of the hakkapeliittas . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yskw4sju4 ), 
  that gun in the picture of the article looks more like a replica bb gun than a real one . 
  pay attention of a casting seam on the cocked hammer , if it was a real gun that hammer would be milled . 
  when i was in army in sodankyl\u00e4 , lapland , the temperature of the day when we had our cooper test run was -25 . 
  i ran 2950m and i still regret that if i 've started little bit faster , i would 've broken the 3000m . 
  there are some pretty important in baltic words in finnish language which are essentially same also in lithuanian or latvian like : kirves - axe , sein\u00e4 - wall and mets\u00e4 - forest . 
  not that it matters or makes any difference , i mean they are both quite similar names arizona and arkansas , but i believe it 's arkansas that `` other arizona '' , which is the home state of bill clinton . 
  brown color that was chosen to reprent 9 should go after orange of 6 and middle light purple of 11-14 should have been between other purples 7 and 8 . 
  also in the beginning the difference between colors is 1 but when it goes down to grayscale and that `` special '' purple the difference 5 -10 deaths . 
   plenty of sharp sticks ... they have metal blades and everybody has at least one , we call them [ `` puukko '' , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puukko ) also axes and [ `` vesuri '' ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kebfyog3ao4/unw4pnvpj4i/aaaaaaaac5c/evcwxdkisgo/s1600/vesuri1.jpg ), 
   ... it would look pretty and festive now that you mentioned , we sometimes actually do exactly that , with christmas trees and everything . 
  [ like this . 
  i 'd say that also estonians are [ metal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgdrc0l54eu ), 
   and the fact that the italians killed his ass proves that european collaboration and shared responsibilities of antiterrorism enforcement works !, 
  it proves nothing . 
  not trying to be condescending about the heroic deed of those two italian policemen , but they did n't even recognize it was him when they decided to check his papers . 
  so it was lucky coincidence and more to do with the inexperience of shit for brains culprit behaving so suspicious it gave reason to id check . 
  i wonder how many arsonists swedish police have caught ? 
  during only the first half of 2016 , there has been [ 2027 car burnings ] ( http://www.inblick.se/nyheter/2016/08/25/bilbranderna-sprider-sig-i-sverige ) just in the four largest cities of southern sweden and some areas of stockholm and those are not even the only places where car burnings has been happened . 
  he has family in tunisia who now came under the rock , but just a while ago tunisian officials still refused to admit that he 's even tunisian . 
  unless tunisians refusal , he could 've been deported first from italy after the arson and later from germany when his asylum application was turned down . 
  is the eu really so pathetically weak and scattered , it ca n't force the governments of those kind countries to receive their deported citizens ? 
  yes , that 's what i wrote . 
  also the name of suspect `` anis a. '', 
  like `` ani '' anakin skywalker aka darth vadar . 
   anis a. from tataouine i wonder if that information is some kind of troll prank . 
  i mean darth vadar hails from desert planet of tatooine , where was known as `` ani '' anakin skywalker , also `` star wars : episode i -- the phantom menace '' was filmed in the tunisian desert . 
  there are just so many co-incidences . 
  you could say that . 
  when i was a kid we moved from jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 to ostrobothnia and i got lot of shit on my neck , for `` sounding pretentious '' and trying to speak `` kirjakieli '' before i learned local dialect . 
  while he explains greece-roman wind god [ notos/auster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anemoi#notos ) as the origin of the name of cardinal direction south , he does n't mention the germanic deity of dawn [ \u0112ostre / ostara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%92ostre ) behind the name of cardinal direction east ( direction of sunrise ) . 
  things seem to become really hairy if the origin of the \u0112ostre is the greek goddess of dawn [ eos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eos ) who is also mother of anemoi notus . 
   i think it was originally pagan in hungary , they have besides st lucia , also [ luca the witch ] ( http://budapestgolocal.blogspot.fi/2011/12/luca-day-13-december-witchspotting-and.html ) which was also observed luca day , dec. 13th . 
  yes , but is it really that ? 
  that is like [ one of the causes of sepoy mutiny . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_rebellion_of_1857#tallow_and_lard-greased_cartridges ) i wonder which animal the fat is actually derived , is it really the tallow from beef or lard from pork ? 
  exact citation from that list :  kristiinanpillu ( l\u00e4hde luum\u00e4ell\u00e4 , nyttemmin kuivunut ) `` kristiina 's cunt ( spring in luum\u00e4ki , nowadays dried up ) '' also luum\u00e4ki means ` bone hill ', 
  some areas , tinted with mustard color in the map have number which goes up to 2.1 and even beyond . 
   what it used to be :o ... 
  but saunas have always been [ one of our military traditions . 
  ] ( http://www.tunturisusi.com/sotilasmarssit/sotasaunat.htm ) and they seem to be as important for our kinfolk estonians . 
  during the wwii there were even plywood kit saunas that take one hour to build and another hour to warm it up to bath . 
  to build proper log sauna it took only one day . 
  i doubt that varg condones the goat burning because after all it represents [ pre-christian era yule traditions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yule_goat#history ) and is connected to worship of the norse god thor . 
  or if he does , it 's mostly because of the commercialization of those traditions . 
  i actually learned today when trying find proper name for the reddish purple that it is called burgundy . 
  i ca n't understand why they have chosen such a similar colors like purple and burgundy to represent each end of the scale in that color scheme ? 
  it wonder if it was possible to make similar map about baltics pre-wwii , if they 'd be as purple as finland . 
  but there is still more purple than yellow compared to them . 
  :o ... you are totally different than poles and belarus . 
  it seems that after us finns the next most finnic , even more than estonians and latvians . 
  that 's true , there were hardly any double vowels in [ mikael agricolas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikael_agricola ) bible translation . 
  for example it seems that we had to settle ` w ' instead of ` uu ' . 
  after thirty years ' war or at least nowadays , we have inexhaustible source of vowels and plunder is certainly a good explanation . 
  even better and stronger word could be * `` ymm\u00e4rr\u00e4mmep\u00e4s '' * ( ~ yes we do understand , [ you 're wrong pal ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/liitepartikkeli#s.c3.a4vypartikkelit_-pa.2c_-han_ja_-s ) ), 
  which is more valuable , new coastline or new land area ? 
  it looks like northern coastline is shared unevenly , british and danes being the winners while dutch and germans are the losers , since the coastline determines new territorial waters and exclusive economic zones . 
  then again how the maintenance cost and responsibilities are shared ? 
  if every country is responsible just for their own coast , the germans and dutch dodge most of the maintenance while still getting vast swaths of land . 
   the few i have seen who conferted walked around veiled for the rest of their lives . 
  it 's pretty easy to understand that in a sunny climate where more affluent men wear pure white and the poorer ones muted light colored [ thawbs , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thawb ) the black colored burqa or niqaab is a torture device . 
  those cloths are designed to discourage women to go out during sweltering daylight when their husbands or fathers might not be home to guard them . 
  it depends if it 's natural or supernatural [ * ` mets\u00e4npeitto ' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mets%c3%a4npeitto )  * some people managed to free themselves from mets\u00e4npeitto by their own means , for example by turning their jacket inside out , by switching their shoes to the wrong feet , or by looking between their own legs . 
  this was because of the idea that everything was topsy-turvy in the lands of the maahinens . 
  some were released seemingly without reason , others only after being sought after by a shaman . 
  some were never seen again . 
  i actually have some doubts that there is still large number of terrorists who could return anymore . 
  at least the is terrorists have already lost all the areas adjacent turkish border , which was their entry point to the theatre of operations , so they ca n't return using that same route . 
  that war seems to be the kind where no side takes any prisoners . 
  terrorists who at beginning executed their prisoners in most gruesome manner and published their deeds on video , now get to taste their own medicine if they surrender . 
  those who managed to return have already arrived and the rest still there have only two options : to die fighting until the grim end or surrender and get executed . 
  foreigners who look different than locals and do n't speak local dialects have no chance for blending local civilian population so that 's no option . 
  ham , blue cheese and pineapple is a classic , but with chicken you need peaches and bbq sauce . 
  however the terminal ancestor of william is [ fornjot , the king of finland , ] ( http://mythology.wikia.com/wiki/fornj%c3%b3t ) which makes her originally a finn because it 's impossible to go further than that . 
  when i visited croatia , i paid attention to the fact that even the most mundane tourist attractions there could be a quite a thrill because of their `` ridiculously bad safety precautions '' meaning that they were not child-proofed , for example low or completely missing guardrails by the drops and chasms . 
  not that i 'd like to change them to be safer , on the contrary having to be careful and pre-planning every action gave the exact feeling of living on the edge i thrived . 
  denmark is pretty flat country , [ m\u00f8lleh\u00f8j ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%b8lleh%c3%b8j ) is the highest natural point , when some other couple of meters higher hills are disqualified as artificial . 
  in estonia they have as high , 170 m artificial [ kivi\u00f5li ash mountain , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/the_kivi%c3%b5li_new_ash_mountain%2c_highest_artificial_hill_in_baltics_-_panoramio.jpg ) originally a remnant of soviet era and an environmental hazard , though landscaping might have slightly alleviated the situation nowadays . 
  here in helsinki as being a quite flat city , we built in purpose [ a 90 m ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/86/248458917_7db4000bc3_z.jpg?zz=1 ) waste hill [ malminkartanonhuippu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malminkartanonhuippu ) however all the other artificial hills pale compared to plans they had in berlin to build 1000 m high [ the berg . 
  ] ( http://www.archdaily.com/40755/the-berg-the-biggest-artificial-mountain-in-the-world ), 
  they outcompete all the other countries in the category of `` deepest valley '' in europe . 
  no , it 's other way around finnish [ country music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4ao-inppuc ) is pretty metal , like also [ music for kids . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxhhlydysqq ), 
  symphonic metal bands with redheaded front woman are not exclusively dutch , there are some finnish bands that fit that depiction [ amberian dawn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtpsitforgy ) [ katra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvp6ylpfbs ), 
  for some reason the map maker has forgotten faroe islands . 
  with [ the number of 13 bands ] ( https://www.metal-archives.com/lists/fo ) there should be a black spot . 
  with a permission of the ceo of helsinki city transport and since bicycle they provided had n't any limits or restriction , he quite likely got it free . 
  if you look closely at the back of that `` book '' , you 'll see it 's actually something like dozen or more smaller books bound together . 
   this german has been complicit in war crimes . 
  actually she probably has n't committed war crimes per se , because nobody acknowledges isis as a legal sovereign state which could have soldiers who have rights or even a belligerent actor who follows `` the laws of war '' . 
  however if she sniped iraqi soldiers and killed some of them as a member of an illegal criminal organization like they claim , then her crime is ** an ordinary plain murder ** .
