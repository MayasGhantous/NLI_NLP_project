there have been several already . 
  norway 's reputation was n't ruined by breivik , but apparently that of finland is so fragile it can be flushed down the toilet by someone wearing bed sheets and a shitty looking cardboard hat . 
  a lot of people here are critical of the government 's handling of the situation , but very few ever show up at a protest because they do n't want to be seen with clowns like these . 
  the most finnish thing ever : wondering what somebody else thinks of us . 
  watching elop destroy nokia step by step was one of the most surreal things i 've ever seen . 
  by the time he came onboard , everyone and their grandmother knew apple had to be challenged , that s60 was the single biggest problem and that the obvious way to fix the situation was to either take a risk by investing everything into getting meego out fast - or to play it safe and go with android . 
  nokia hardware combined with android would have been a match made in heaven . 
  elop himself talked constantly about the importance of ecosystems , and rightly so - but then proceeded to pick the one os that barely existed on paper and had no user base and no developers to make its ecosystem worth anything . 
  not only that , but he tied the company to an exclusivity deal with microsoft where wp was the only option and the android nokia could never even be allowed to show its potential . 
  everyone at the time knew the decisions elop ( and his enablers ) were making were absolutely disastrous , and still he made them . 
  for sure microsoft got to buy nokia for cheap in the end , but by that time it was n't worth anything to them either . 
  none of it made any sense , but the destruction was real and people are losing their jobs over it to this day as the remains of microsoft 's mobile wing are being shut down . 
  needless to say , elop is not a popular name in this country . 
  something the article left out is that while the african immigrants ( many of whom in finland are somalis ) indeed have a higher risk ( [ over 4 times as high ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j1xoov7.png ) ) of getting raped than native finns , the men in those groups also commit rape at a much higher rate . 
  [ even when age and income are factored in , rape rate for immigrants from africa is over 10 times that of the native population . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yd3gwvv.png ) the highest rates are for those originating in `` africa '' and `` middle east and north africa '' .

  personally i 'd prefer the greens to be in there , but people who pretend the sky is falling just because we have a slightly different set of parties in the government are going to have a pretty boring four years . 
  in any case , the previous government was so useless that literally anything else is an improvement . 
  maybe this one will actually get something done . 
   ultra-nationalist - apparently what ? 
  readiness to defend the country = ultra-nationalism ? 
   religiously conservative - surprisingly so , considering the last elections the elections in which the christian democrats lost support and fell from the government ? 
  with a sentence like that you could have convinced me we 're not the only ones . 
  having a circle jerk every time we do something better than the swedes is obligatory , how else would we show off our national inferiority complex ? 
  this shit is getting a bit old . 
  with the way estonia is doing , soon we 'll wish we could into baltic . 
  three planes in ~ 20 years is not a bad loss rate for a plane in active service . 
  accidents happen [ all the time . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_military_aircraft_\\ ( 2010 % e2 % 80 % 93present \\ ) ), 
   and it has n't crashed since . 
  with the exception of the three crashes it 's had in [ swedish air force service ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accidents_and_incidents_involving_the_jas_39_gripen#swedish_air_force ) . 
  had a good laugh , thanks . 
  as a carrier aircraft the f/a -18 has worked well with the finnish road bases and there 's no reason why the f-35 would n't work just as well , assuming that 'd be the version we 're looking at . 
  it has only one engine though as opposed to two on the hornet so its survivability is n't as good in cases of engine failure , but then again gripen has the same issue . 
  it seems people tend to judge the f-35 based on the development program , but that 's missing the point . 
  the program may have earned all the criticism it 's getting , but what matters in the end is the performance of the final product . 
  too many countries have bet the future of their air force on this plane , they 're not going to settle for something less than what was advertised . 
  besides , the development will go on and there will always be a secured supply for armaments and spare parts . 
  the reason i 'm skeptical of the gripen ng is that it 's a warmed-up version of an older plane instead of something truly cutting edge , and will inevitably have to be replaced sooner . 
  we might also end up having to buy it for political reasons . 
  sweden has put significant pressure on finland in the past to buy the gripen , and they 're bound to do that again . 
  given the importance of the gripen and the continued domestic fighter production ( and the industry it supports ) for the swedish economy , they have a lot more to lose in a deal like that than lockheed martin does . 
  russia has annexed crimea , wages a war in ukraine , violates its neighbours ' territories routinely ... but nato is the one pushing for war ? 
  as for finland , we 're not militarily allied , we have no guarantees of anything . 
  the eu has no army , all it can do is write an angry letter . 
  if you think the nordics are going to help us , look at the map , and look at history . 
  we have no buffer zone . 
  we are the buffer . 
  regardless , military threat is not the first concern here . 
  the first concern is finlandization and return to a new cold war situation in which moscow calls the shots in helsinki . 
  that 's not going to be something visible , something dramatic , but it will affect the independent decision making in this country more than even a war would . 
  well , as far as the development program goes , the f-35 is exceptional even in that league , both in cost overruns and in delays . 
  does n't mean it 's a bad plane though . 
  could very well end up being one of the best . 
  in fact , with the money they 've poured into it , it 'd better be one of the best . 
  if we 're talking about the testing phase , apparently they got it [ twice . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accidents_and_incidents_involving_the_jas_39_gripen#crashes_during_testing ) first time in [ 1989 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgtq3edkcn0 ) second time in [ 1993 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itoq2fykoi ), 
  if finland gets invaded , we 'll have to stand alone and suffer our own stupidity of not joining nato . 
  any military operation is very unlikely though , finland is far more useful to russia as an obedient servant and a european puppet state . 
  during the cold war the soviet embassy held a lot of power in helsinki , for russia it would be very attractive to have it working the same way again . 
   i get how they managed to justify crimea , but they 'd never be able to do that to finland , or the baltics , right ? 
  with the baltics they could use the excuse of protecting the ethnic russian population , but since the baltics are in the nato , they 're unlikely to mess with them militarily . 
  with finland they 're most likely to use political pressure and to repeat the cold war policies - keeping finland out of nato , formally neutral but in practice bending to moscow 's every whim . 
  should n't be too difficult given that finland 's political leadership is naive at best and has been more than happy to give russia free political chips , such as the recently approved construction of a [ rosatom nuclear power plant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanhikivi_nuclear_power_plant ) in finland . 
  not that excited about gripen . 
  the basic versions are outdated and the ng exists only on paper . 
  doubtless the swedes will lobby hard for finland to buy the gripen , but i hope we 'll wait long enough to see the f-35 become operational to be able to fully evaluate it . 
  the voters of the spp are dwindling in numbers and they 're trying to attract new ones from other minority groups by presenting themselves as their defenders . 
  not that they will let anybody be equal to them though , as their attitudes on language policy clearly [ shows ] ( http://www.hs.fi/sunnuntai/a1370662540973 ) . 
  i would n't go so far to say it 's hatred , at most it 's dislike or annoyance . 
  i doubt many finns care one way or the other about the party , but the fact that it 's a one-issue party that gives their political backing to any government that will keep the swedish language compulsory in schools for the finnish population ( 90 % ) , makes them feel like a political tumor that deserves to be cut off once in a while . 
  i 'm all for swedish people 's rights , but one tiny party ca n't be allowed to hold an issue like that in a political deadlock for decades on end . 
  they kind of brought that to themselves though . 
  either they knew the original translation was going to be inflammatory or their pr people were just idiots . 
  apparently they got wiser , but some of the international media still keep referring to them as `` true finns '' ... either to marginalize them politically or because it just sounds more scandalous and gets more clicks . 
  pretty much this . 
  i 'd say * common finns * or * regular finns * is a good approximation of their finnish name . 
  politically they 're centrist conservatives . 
  [ this is how their candidates ( light blue ) placed on the political map in comparison with other parties . 
  f/a -18 . 
  they got the ground attack capability in mlu2 . 
  no rich , ca n't make army , paid for greece army . 
  not really . 
  finland has always had a conscript system and essentially the reserve is the army , so it has to be properly trained . 
  besides , it 's a proven concept . 
  ** sweden : **  active  - 19 951 soldiers  - 22 000 guardsmen  reserve  - 12 000 ** finland : **  active  - 22 000  reserve  - 230 000 considering any serious attack against sweden would have to come through finland , that 's a pretty good buffer force to have . 
   finland has another use for russia . 
  it 's the ` friend ' in the eu , the ` common sense among warmongers ( khmm ... baltics ) ' . 
  its use is to show that a respected country still trades and communicates with moscow , so not all of europe is against russia . 
  that the good old finns understand putin very well . 
  this . 
  finland is far more useful to moscow as a tool to influence the eu and the west than it would be as an occupied territory . 
  of course this only works because finlandization is still alive and well , and because our politicians are willing to bend over backwards to understand moscow 's every wish . 
  not that this is seen as bowing under pressure here as it might be in any other western country , rather it 's seen as being a good friend . 
  the core of finlandization has always been for the finnish leadership to anticipate moscow 's attitudes to such a degree that nobody would even think of suggesting a policy that has any risk of harming the `` friendship '' . 
  in other words , finlandization constitutes a self censorship not only on a political but almost on a mental level . 
  paradoxically the estonians have a much wider room for movement politically today because they allow themselves to think of options the finns never would .
