i guess kebab is much harder to make that must be why they 're called kebab technicians . 
   i wonder why though . 
  maybe us culture is more `` steadfast '' and wo n't deal with bs people try to introduce . 
  or maybe they do n't all live together like in europe . 
  usa attracts a lot of educated professionals - these tend to do well in most places . 
  some groups , like refugees from somalia , are struggling to integrate in both europe and the us . 
   this incoherent narrative that the left is simultaneously powerless and all powerful what narrative ? 
  the comment talked about `` left and other established parties '' , not some all-powerful left . 
  ( i 'm on the left myself , but agree with the criticism above . 
  imo large parts of the current political left are missing a coherent agenda and are acting as useful idiots in the weakening of the welfare state . ),

   moved to helsinki under an asylum program about two years back , straight from a refugee camp the quota refugees are much less likely to have unrealistic expectations or demands since they come from the camps , get interviewed in advance and are directed straight to municipality placement . 
   statements like the one from 22 year old muhammed here are going to be the only ones picked up and reported by the mainstream news not in my experience . 
  at least in finland , mainstream media has tended to report very uncritically about the asylum seekers , but lately the picture is getting a little more complex . 
  do let the door hit you on the ass on the way out . 
   their solution is to import a younger demographic to prop the welfare state up . 
  or to tear it down , like the swedish `` liberals '' who envision open borders and stockholm ghettos where people subsist on a bag of rice a month .

   i feel like we 're bad neighbors by looking the other way and waving them onto our trains for free passage to finland , but on the other hand it relieves us of some of the burden . 
  in the short run , yes ; in the not-that-long run , enabling asylum shopping only increases the pull factor .

  most of the border follows the river .

  few of the country 's leaders seem at all aware that integration is worse today than it was , for example , 1991 . . 
   it is difficult to reliably predict the future , but we can at least get a clue about how our `` long term '' will look like by looking at the experiments , the municipalities of malm\u00f6 , botkyrka and s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje . 
  these municipalities are a generation ahead of sweden in terms of ethnic and cultural diversity . 
  this is the `` long run '' has already occurred . 
  yet there is no municipality with a high concentration of diversity that are doing well . 
   what 's that estonian flag doing there ? 
  maybe something to do with the estonian guest workers who were evicted from a finnish hostel last month in order to house asylum seekers ? 
   do people like that guy have any idea how they come across ? 
  if they behaved like this at home , it could explain why it 's so hard to achieve peace in the middle east : /, 
   haha i wish they 'd try to get to the u.s. like this . 
  they would probably get shot at the border . 
  but once inside , protest away !, 
   well if you watch the video he is complaining about :  - nearest supermarket 30 minutes walk  - nearest hospital 45 minutes drive  - no schools in the area ( corrected by the reporter that there is a school in the village , the guy replied that they have been told that there are no schools in the area ) well , tough . 
  most people do n't have optimal living arrangements from day one when they first move to a new country , let alone for free . 
  that already happened : http://www.thelocal.se/20150101/refugees-protest-rural-sweden-re-location, 
  it 's a complete joke . 
  the quota would redistribute a few thousand migrants each to sweden and finland : that 's less than the number currently arriving here in a week on their own .

  -164 iraqis canceled their asylum request so far this year , numbers growing - many are returning for family reasons - some were disappointed after the rosy image of finland painted by their countrymen or people smugglers : for instance , they failed to get jobs right away ( no shit ?? ), 
  - authorities will cover return flights if necessary , but many are using their own credit cards, 
  fun fact 2 :  `` the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming ** directly ** from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , ** provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence ** '',

  but maybe that 's changing ? 
  in any case , i have to give vasabladet ( and \u00d6sterbottens tidning ) credit for [ this story ] ( http://online.vasabladet.fi/artikel/visa/75863 ) , which i have n't seen reported anywhere else yet . 
  `` many of the asylum seekers at the kemi reception facility are disappointed in how finland has treated them .

   it would be very hard for finland to fully secure the finnish-swedish border , it 's not really similar case to hungary . 
  it would be much easier than hungary , if our politicians were n't too chickenshit . 
  it 's only a few kms on land , the river would at least slow them down . 
  that report fudged the facts . 
  they counted any amount of tertiary education , even short vocational courses , as a `` university degree '' .

  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-blocks-schengen-membership-for-bulgaria-romania/a-16656037 )  german interior minister hans-peter friedrich told a meeting of eu interior ministers in brussels on thursday that bulgaria and romania do not meet the criteria to join the 26-member , visa-free schengen zone . 
  `` there are some areas of weakness , such as in the functionality of the judicial system , that prevents us from saying : abolish the borders , '' said friedrich , warning that a wave of impoverished people could migrate to germany in search of better social services . 
   do you know if the swedish language media ( like vasabladet ) in finland are any better , or are they a lost cause too ? 
  if anything , they tend to be a bit worse than the finnish language media . 
   if we were n't ready for a fuller form of federalization , we should n't have implemented schengen-type of agreements in the first place . 
  the nordic countries have had free movement since 1958 without federalization . 
  it works less well if you try to shoehorn very different systems together . 
  e : i suspect eu would have more success implementing common border controls if they did n't try to marry it to this abortion of a quota scheme , though . 
  big `` if '' . 
  in sweden even `` paperless '' migrants have a legal right to healthcare and schooling for children . 
  granting them welfare is probably not far behind . 
  a lot of the migrants pass through greece without registering or their applications are rejected . 
  norway accepts more applications per capita . 
  http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/09/daily-chart up until last year germany took in middling numbers of asylum seekers per capita ( less than norway in fact ) : it only has a reputation as a hugely generous country , because the absolute number of asylum seekers there is high . 
   jesus christ , imagine easterners getting `` syrian muslim gypsies '' trough the quotas ... 
  it would be poetic justice .

  marx just had [ the wrong species . 
  if they have family in finland , they could have applied for family reunification directly from iraq . 
  except now the train company says refugees can travel without paying for a `` whole ticket '' and that they wo n't remove any refugees from the trains .
