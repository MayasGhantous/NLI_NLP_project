   basque genome also shows farmer ancestry , since complete isolation is almost impossible , but their hunter roots are still much more significant than in any other european group . 
  not according to [ recent genetic studies  ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/09/unusual-relic-language-comes-small-group-farmers-isolated-thousands-years )  as in earlier studies , the team found that the genomes of ancient european farmers represented a mixture of genes from earlier , indigenous hunter-gatherers and incoming agriculturalists . 
  but today 's basques turned out to be more closely related to the el portal\u00f3n farmers than to any other group in the study , including early hunter-gatherer genomes . 
  according to the [ three-population model by lazaridis et al ] ( http://eurogenes.blogspot.fi/2013/12/ancient-human-genomes-suggest-three.html ) , estonians and lithuanians actually have the highest proportion of west european hunter gatherer ancestry , but in reality the situation is even more complicated , since the `` early european farmer '' population had already mixed with local hunter-gatherers .

  sweden is one of the eu countries where [ asylum seekers have most extensive rights to work .

   bark beetle infection what potentially makes this one ` worse ' ( from a human perspective ) from previous infections is that modern fire management has made spruce much more common in bia\u0142owie\u017ca than it was [ under previous centuries ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01710.x/full ) ( there 's some debate as to what extent fires in the past were caused and controlled by humans ) :  from 1653 to the late 1700s fires were very frequent , with mean point ( single tree ) fire intervals of 18 years and mean stand scale fire intervals of 6 years . 
  after 1781 , the intervals between the fires increased dramatically , and since 1874 no major fire was recorded . 
   tree establishment underwent substantial changes , closely tracking shifts in fire frequency . 
  when fires were frequent , * pinus sylvestris * establishment occurred only sporadically . 
  later , less frequent fires promoted massive establishment of both * p. sylvestris * and * picea abies * . 
  at present , only * p. abies * and a few deciduous trees regenerate . 
   as an island on the edge of europe , white british and white irish are about as genetically isolated as you can get genetically , the british or irish are n't outliers in europe : for example , see [ this map ] ( https://evolutionistx.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/genetic_map_of_europe.png ) or [ this map ] ( http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/ejhg2015233x8.jpg ) based on recent genetic studies . 
  [ here ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/europevariation-752360.jpg ) the british isles stick out a little more , but that could partly be an effect of more limited sampling ( it 's from a slightly [ older study ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/08/the-genetic-map-of-europe/#.v0dijshuhau ) ) . 
  this does n't mean that the ancestors of native british and irish are recent arrivals from the mainland : it 's rather that much of europe shares the same genetic background ( at least since the spread of agriculture in the neolithic ) .

  from the [ report ] ( http://www.opennetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tent-open-refugees-work_v13.pdf ) :  once refugees start working , this investment may yield seven additional dividends . 
  some refugees do dirty , difficult , ( relatively ) dangerous and dull ( 4d ) jobs that locals spurn , such as cleaning offices and caring for the elderly , which is the fastest area of employment growth in advanced economies . 
  so progressive , much humanitarian , wow, 
  maybe in part because it 's not a very good argument - you ca n't just look at gdp growth and call it a benefit without factoring in population increase and increased demand for services . 
   refugees ca n't work here .

  it seems asylum seekers can get a permit to work [ after 6 months ] ( https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/asylum/conditions_for_asylum_applicants/job_prospects.htm ) and quota refugees are required to sign a [ declaration ] ( https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/asylum/quota_refugees/quota_refugees.htm ) stating their willingness to work and learn danish , which would be a bit strange if they were n't allowed to work .

  lynx are not routinely tagged in finland . 
  typically no more than 10 to 15 are radio-collared in a year . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.rktl.fi/www/uploads/pdf/uudet%20julkaisut/selvityksia_9_10_web.pdf ) an example of the methods used in estimating lynx numbers :  about 1,000 hunters from 130 hunting clubs searched for the tracks over an area covering 4,827 km ^ 2 , combing the area slowly along designated routes . 
  the combined length of the routes was 5,096 km ( average 1.06 km/km ^ 2 ) . 
  upon discovering a carnivore track , the species , number of individuals and direction of travel were recorded . 
  overlap between lynx litter observations was eliminated as carefully as possible . 
  at least 19 separate litters were found , with approximately 1 to 5 litters undetected . 
  the size of the western uusimaa lynx population was estimated at 110 -- 155 animals . 
  the map statistic is from 2012 , when a larger snow track count for large predators was performed in finland , which is probably why the numbers are so specific . 
   2400 - 2600 would have made more sense . 
  these are official statistics used for game management , among other things . 
  lynx do limit the population of [ ` mesopredators ' like red foxes .

   being a nurse is a pretty well qualified job , and not a field that especially attracts thrill seekers who would be more likely to move just on the chance of finding a job later . 
  maybe not , but on the other hand , turnover for foreign nurses in the uk seems to have been high [ even before brexit  ( https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/nurse-managers/exclusive-trusts-hit-by-high-turnover-of-nurses-recruited-from-abroad/5081928.article )  hospital trusts are failing to keep hold of nurses recruited from abroad , with some losing the majority within just a year of hiring them , an investigation by nursing times has revealed . 
  there have been similar issues with foreign nurses recruited to finland . 
   i also would like to point out that we are arguing over the size of the brexit effect , that the huge uncertainty associated with it would discourage many people from moving to the uk seems pretty self-evident . 
  at the same time , the total number of nurses in the nhs data has been going up compared with the same month in the preceding year for every month since may 2012 , which suggests the effects are more complex than the guardian article implies . 
  if eu nurses are quitting and no longer signing up at the rates they used to , who is making up for the shortfall ? 
  what 's going on with the downvotes ? 
  i was going to ask the same thing . 
   i took a quick look at the nhs staff numbers and the seasonality ( in 2015 ) for total nurses peaks in december and bottoms in june/july for the total number of nurses and health visitors , august seems to be the low point for 2015 ( and for every year 2012-2016 ) , despite the high number of eu nationals joining in july 2015 . 
  brexit does n't seem to have caused an exception to this general trend . 
  do nurses from other eu nations tend to get recruited more often in the summer to cover for a seasonal ( holiday-related ? ), 
  shortage in local nurses ? 
  in that case , it would be misleading to attribute the difference between july and december 2016 to brexit .

  [ both  ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34261065 )  mr johansson says that understanding the significant and positive impact refugees can have on an economy is key , particularly for governments in the ageing countries of northern europe , where more workers are needed to support the growing number of pensioners . 
   `` take , for example , the syrians who are now coming to sweden , '' he says . 
  `` one third of them have higher education . 
  they are doctors , engineers , nurses , people we know we will need in the swedish economy .

  eurostat labor survey only covers residents in private households , not [ recently arrived migrants or people staying in reception facilities ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/migrant-integration/methodology ) :  persons living in collective households and in institutions for asylum seekers and migrant workers are excluded from the target population . 
  this also results in under-coverage of migrants in the survey .
