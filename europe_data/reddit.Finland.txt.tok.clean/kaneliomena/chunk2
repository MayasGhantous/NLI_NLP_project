  not exactly , but it 's probably easy to get that impression from statements like this : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/fluechtlingskrise/merkel-grundrecht-auf-asyl-kennt-keine-obergrenze-13797029.html  chancellor angela merkel ( cdu ) refuses to limit the reception of refugees in germany . 
  `` the fundamental right to asylum for politically persecuted knows no limit ; the same goes for the refugees coming from the hell of civil war to us , `` she told the rheinische post . 
  when asked if perhaps about a million people come into this year and could be integrated , said the chancellor : `` i do not intend to participate in estimates . 
  we can not know how many return to their countries again when the situation will improve there someday hopefully also . 
  but no doubt many will remain . 
  in it we should especially see an opportunity . 
  if we allow education and integration , the people who have , for example , from syria found refuge with us are our country back much . 
  let us approach openly and with confidence to the task . '', 
  in finland we have temporary tax on cars since 1958 , 
  that 's funny , because finnish politicians and media are very fond of invoking eastern europe as a bogeyman ( if we do n't do x , we 'll be just like eastern europe ! ), 
  i wonder if that warning could turn on its head somewhere down the line . 
   there are , at the moment , just to many states who are against an solidary distribution of refugees because they arent or only slightly affected by the refugees and dont want to take them . 
  the asylum seekers do n't seem to show much interest in being solidarily distributed , either . 
   we will have to invade you so , either way , [ history will repeat itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_intervention_in_the_thirty_years'_war ) ? 
  imperfect analogy , but it 's kind of as if canada had declared `` we welcome all poor south americans to come and live here '' , but they wo n't be given visas so they can fly in , they have to travel through all the countries in between . 
  then after a while canada says `` too many are coming , mexico and usa must take more responsibility '' . 
  culture is part of ethnicity . 
  no ethnic group is closed , but adoption etc. 
  were historically the exception , not the rule , otherwise any differences would have been eradicated over time . 
  some eu countries are in the [ resettlement program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#resettlement ) as well . 
  but as long as asylum seekers are allowed to bypass the quotas , it will be a tempting option for many . 
  hard to say - it will probably be a while until they do a comparable survey . 
  the support for taking in more refugees grew to 25 % after the drowned syrian boy was featured prominently by the media . 
  http://www.svd.se/sifo-svenskarnas-syn-pa-flyktingar-har-andrats-snabbt before that , 34 % wanted to take in less refugees , 31 % preferred the current level , 17 % wanted to take more . 
  of course it is n't . 
  human rights pertain to individuals , self-determination rights pertain to groups . 
   the following great migration which mixed all the people up do you consider norwegians and catalans as belonging to the same ethnic group ? 
  or basques and sami ? 
  herp derp united nations charter  to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, 
   concentrate the policy in a few countries , see them fail completely in integration and then ask : why should the rest of europe follow ? 
  except germany and sweden already have their dolchsto\u00dflegende to explain why they fail : because other countries refused to `` take responsibility '' and `` share the burden '' . 
  they do n't take into account that the `` burden '' largely refuses to be shared . 
   when reading this kind of stats , it 's important to notice if all immigrants are counted . 
  refugees ( broadly speaking ) and their relatives are counted in the 35 % . 
  [ sauce in swedish ] ( http://staffandanielsson.blogspot.fi/2016/02/rut-rapport-25-av-flyktingar-har.html ), 
   the poles are like tokienesque fantasy `` dwarves '' . 
  they 're loud , they 're bearded ... even the women ? 
  the initial ` k ' is missing from some of the entries . 
  no finnish words actually begin with `` auppa '' . 
  r1a is not exclusively slavic , it 's also associated with other indo-european migrations . 
  thinking of haplogroups in terms of modern ethnicities can be misleading ; the association is probably much older than either scandinavians or slavs . 
  like the borg : by [ assimilation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs#assimilation ), 
   what is the significance of fighting in finnish uniforms rather than german ? 
  germany was occupying estonia at the time and was drafting estonians to fight the soviets , and [ thus ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_infantry_regiment_200 )  joining the armed forces of finland , a kindred nation , appeared a reasonable alternative for those who wished to fight for the freedom of estonia and against the advancing red army , but who for ideological reasons or historical grievances were unwilling to do it in the german uniform . 
  thanks obomba, 
   they showed locals cooking food in a shit ton of lard . 
  they could have just gone to okinawa if that 's all they wanted to film . 
   europeans do n't generally think that of the poles , afaik . 
  they 're certainly viewed very positively in norway . 
  [ why problem make when you no problem have you do n't want to make ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqkgwdh500 ), 
   what are the most common mushrooms eaten ? 
  traditionally any milkcap ( lactarius ) species with white sap , which are made palatable by shortly boiling them . 
  most pickers nowadays tend to go for a few easily recognised species like chanterelles , funnel chanterelles and king boletes . 
  experienced collectors can make use of dozens of different kinds of mushrooms . 
  [ false morels ] ( http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/morel.htm ) are just coming into season , but need to be carefully prepared since they 're deadly poisonous when raw . 
  the latest fad , especially in the north , is collecting [ matsutake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matsutake ) mushrooms for the japanese market . 
  they were n't traditionally used in finland , but the cult status in japan is inspiring people to try them here as well . 
   what 's the most popular mushroom dish ? 
  it 's common to use them in soups , sauces or pies , or just pan fried with butter and onions . 
  [ mushroom salad ] ( http://www.arctic-cloudberry.com/2015/08/finnish-wild-mushroom-salad.html ) is a popular traditional dish . 
   equally important is what you do n't see : teachers in meri-rastila or any other finnish school delivering lessons from the front of the room , and their students taking notes -- the core of the `` german system '' that the finns abandoned . 
  at least they did n't repeat the `` no homework '' meme , but what 's with these exaggerated ideas about finnish schools ? 
  teachers do still give lessons and students take notes , although of course a primary school lesson is n't one long university-style lecture . 
   tiina kahara , the grade 4 teacher , and her assistant present each lesson or unit three ways , to suit varying levels of language facility and education . 
  ( half of her 27 students ca n't speak finnish fluently . ), 
  this , she says , is better -- not just for the immigrant students but for the native-born finns : `` it means that everyone gets more resources and a form of teaching tailored to their style . 
  it 's a better form of education for everyone . '' and if you get the idea the first time , you need to sit through the same lesson two more times ? 
  ( this is not some shared feature of `` finnish schools '' , either . ), 
  good choice , but not as representative as [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ujkk9h4xs ), 
  maybe , but i 'm not sure if their farming experience would have translated well to northern european conditions . 
  yes , it 's kind of a ` damned if you do , damned if you do n't ' - situation . 
  smaller compared to present immigration , but radicalisation has been building over time when the levels were smaller . 
  during [ earlier peaks ] ( https://transnationellatankar.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/bild-utvandring-invandring-1851-2011.png ) of guest worker migration in 60s/70s and refugees from the balkans in the early 90s , immigrants often ended up shoehorned in those same suburbs , but that did n't result in permanent segregation for those groups . 
  to prevent further segregation , sweden would be better off abolishing the right of asylum seekers to find their own accommodation , but that would put even more pressure on authorities to find suitable housing for them . 
  previous waves of immigrants did fine in those same suburbs , though . 
   in part , this is due to government housing policies that aimed to place new immigrant arrivals in available housing . 
  well , where else would you put them ? 
  in non-available housing ? 
  with babies !, 
  i did n't see them yesterday , any idea when they hatched ? 
  eagle-cam is down !, 
  they have other nests to watch as well : http://pontu.eenet.ee/, 
   this is a mentality issue and one of the byproducts of the `` immigrants are scum '' mentality that is pretty popular , especially on reddit . 
  despite individual tales of woe , on average immigrants in sweden are [ as likely to find work ] ( http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/86d73b72a97345feb2a8cbc8b6700fa7/sou-2015104-langtidsutredningen-2015-huvudbetankande ) corresponding to their education level as locals , as long as individual skills ( such as literacy and numeracy ) are accounted for :  there are no significant differences between people born outside sweden or in sweden as regards being in work , if the individual 's skills level is taken into account . 
  neither do the equal explained by foreign-born people working to a greater extent in occupations that do not correspond to their skills level . 
  the same picture emerges in an oecd study of swedish piaac data that controls for a large number of background variables . 
  the survey assesses that the swedish labour market on average does not seem to be characterised by ethnic discrimination , but is mainly focused on individuals ' skills . 
  asylum seekers can work in sweden , but very few of them find jobs . 
  last year , only 1 out of 60 asylum seekers with temporary work permits had a job ( [ source ] ( http://arbetet.se/2015/06/05/mycket-fa-asylsokande-har-jobb-trots-tillstand/ ) ) . 
   i 'm guessing that the state and the municipalities are legally bound in organizing all this , but i bet that private companies are providing the actual services ? 
  [ bert karlsson ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-swedenbusiness-iduskcn0ro1hv20150924 ) is probably the most notorious figure in sweden 's asylum business :  a swedish pop music tycoon turned tv celebrity who once founded an anti-immigration political party might well be the most unlikely beneficiary of europe 's migration crisis . 
   but as long as the country is taking in the most asylum seekers per capita of any in europe , bert karlsson is happy to earn a fortune from the government for housing them . 
  the [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l8vo5f6.png ) that was posted elsewhere in the thread shows that payments for immigration are already way over budget this year ( red bar is the extra cost ) . 
  that was the amount budgeted for migration agency based on last year 's estimates . 
  the red bar is the extra cost the migration and employment agencies are estimated to incur this year over the budget . 
  the bar called `` j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhet och nyanl\u00e4ndas etablering '' ( equality and establishment of newly arrived immigrants ) is also mostly migration costs . 
  swedish social democrats before : `` it 's worth paying all those taxes to maintain such a cohesive , well-functioning society as we have .
