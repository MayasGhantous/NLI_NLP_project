  that 's no way to talk about the migrants !, 
  `` massively restrictive '' = must offer contract and pay at least minimum wage . 
  the problems mentioned in the article are n't due to labor laws , but exploitative employers and hostile bureaucracy . 
   youssef frayha , a syrian student , said he had been unable to get a kimlik because his landlord had refused to give him a rent contract -- one of the requirements for any kimlik applicant . 
  this bureaucratic snag was what prompted frayha to try to reach greece last weekend , even after the introduction of the eu-turkey deportation deal fleeing to europe to escape bureaucracy ? 
  oh , my sweet summer child . 
   only 0.1 % of the syrians in turkey have applied for a work permit that 's exactly what it means : 0.1 % have applied * so far * under the new rules . 
  probably because there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled , which the guardian inexplicably tries to spin as a bad thing :  critics say law does not offer refugees route to legal labour market as it requires employers to offer contracts and pay minimum wage, 
  all of the stats refer to working age individuals . 
  `` families '' is mentioned because the statistics separate people by immigration status ( some of the people in the group immigrated as refugees and some as relatives to refugees ) . 
  the [ report ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/johanwesterholm/rut-flyktingar-i-arbete ) simply summarizes official employment statistics provided by the swedish statistics agency ( scb ) .

   american liberals tend to idealize how awesome european socialism is related to that point , as [ this article ] ( http://www.aei.org/publication/the-american-lefts-two-europes-problem/ ) points out , american liberals tend to focus on northern europe and not so much on the less favourable outcomes of high social spending in southern europe . 
  except in the current study , larmuseau et al also looked for evidence for historical extra-pair paternity rates and found that the high estimates were n't so `` well documented '' after all : http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/cp-cfr032916.php  by combining genetics and in-depth genealogies , he added , it 's now even possible to look back at the epp rates in the historical past . 
  those data suggest that the rates of epp have n't changed much over time .

  [ much diverse , so vibrant , many culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_papua_new_guinea )  papua new guinea has several thousand separate communities , most with only a few hundred people .

  it 's well known in finland as well : `` mauri on teht\u00e4v\u00e4ns\u00e4 tehnyt , mauri saa menn\u00e4 '' . 
  in finnish , `` mauri '' means moor but is also a common male first name , so people are often confused about the origins of the expression .

   just wait until you learn that modern humans come from africa , and the white `` race '' is a result of blacks breeding with neanderthals . 
  so , technically , just the blacks are pure blooded . 
  actually , there are no `` pure blooded '' human populations . 
  [ africans have also interbred with archaic humans ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3174671/ ) , just not with neanderthals .

   it would be cheaper to fly & feed the finnish refugees in turkey turkey no asyl good , kebab every day ... wait , that actually sounds pretty good, 
   and of course it would be mainly immigrants who arrive later in the year . 
  they mean students who immigrated after grade one , not whether they immigrated in the middle of the school year .

  it 's useful to distinguish between descriptive and normative multiculturalism . 
  the fact of different cultures existing side by side is not inherently good or bad ; normative multiculturalism ( that it 's inherently better to retain your culture than to assimilate ) is what most people have a problem with . 
   think about d\u00f6ner being the most popular german fastfood .

  how much is that in quattro stagionis , fanta and netflix ? 
  it was n't the only factor but one in a string of events : sweden granting permanent residence to all syrians , countries freezing dublin returns to greece ... all of this has been building up to create stronger pull factors to eu . 
   a stomach ulcer due to bad food .

  prepackaged croissants from the army and here i thought stomach ulcers were caused by [ common gut bacteria ] ( http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/press.html ) or anti-inflammatory drugs , not cold spaghetti or croissants . 
   the problem with that is there is very little sense of identity for iraq as a country . 
  true , but putting aside your differences to fight a common enemy is one way to forge such an identity . 
  the divisions of the civil war were still very much present in finnish society during winter war 21 years later , but few people argue that working-class men should have left the country rather than fight under the command of their former enemies .

  they should n't be left in an `` informal settlement '' anyway . 
   and the nations close to the disaster remain functional so that number of refugees remains small . 
  except now they get trampled by a growing stream of migrants trying to get to the sweet interior . 
  eventually the interior countries get overwhelmed too and slam the gates , leaving the border countries stuck . 
  have n't we been through this already ? 
  or are some still dreaming that the crisis could be solved by forcing a fraction of the refugees on a reluctant eastern europe ?

  it was the president who suggested reforming asylum rules , but he has no actual power over the decision . 
   lol , you 've never flown , that 's literally what happens when you get off a plane , you go though the tunnels , end up at border control where they check your passport . 
  you said they would be controlled as they come through `` the little airplane docking tunnels '' , that 's not how it happens now . 
   allowing them to fly in would leave us with far more options of regulation , it 's easier to handle people coming in through the little airplane docking tunnels . 
  so each airport docking tunnel should have its own id check as people are coming in ? 
  all international airports should be converted to giant asylum processing center and holding facility for deportees ? 
   how are you going to check people crossing by foot at any random place along a border ten thousands of km long . 
  allowing the same thing at airports is simply adding to the problem . 
  with the current asylum regulations they still need to be let in if they refuse to show id on arrival . 
  and if we repeal the carrier 's liability directive , then the airlines will have no responsibility to pass on passenger information to authorities . 
   which is why repealing the eu directive in the linked video is such a good idea , because then at least they 'd be arriving on their passports if we stopped requiring airlines to check passports , would they still be arriving with their passports ? 
  repealing that directive would in practice mean unregulated immigration into the eu from anywhere in the world , not just at certain border crossings like now .
