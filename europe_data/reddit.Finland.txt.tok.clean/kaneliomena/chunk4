  they were n't shortchanged ( edit : at least not when it comes to minister posts ) , but there 's been some speculation they avoided picking the `` hard '' posts like finance in order not to lose support among working class voters ( if so , it did n't work out so well , since their support crashed anyway ), 
   there is no such thing as refusing entry at border for asylum seekers in our law . 
  does the law actually explicitly say that or is it more selective interpretation ? 
  according to treaties refugees ca n't be held liable for breaking those laws , but afaik , our foreigner law [ does n't exempt asylum seekers ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20040301#l2p11 ) from e.g. 
  passport and visa requirements . 
  it ca n't be that bad in some parts of iraq , if many decide to return because finland is [ too cold ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-finland-iduskcn0vl0ue ) . 
   the u.s. at its best integrates people from all cultures relatively well , and europe would be wise to try and find ways to do the same find ways to be as selective about refugee immigration as the us ? 
  i quite agree ( and even then there are similar problems with integration [ if you compare similar groups ] ( http://www.psmag.com/books-and-culture/what-makes-somalis-so-different-26347 ) in the us and europe ), 
   what about nature ? 
  ca n't exactly bulldoze that . 
  think [ outside the box ] ( http://www.kuvakuja.fi/sites/kuvakuja.fi/files/imagecache/slideshow_horizontal/original_images/00/00/02/84/e7295778909ae77eb48c4279bf59832703002b86.jpg ) ? 
  i was referring to the swedish term , not english  but even most english speakers should be able to judge from the context that i 'm talking about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gymnasium ) and not [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gym ) . 
   europe has already agreed on a key for relocation which has been a near-total flop , with [ only a few hundred relocated so far ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/why-eu-refugee-relocation-policy-has-been-a-flop-frontex-easo-med/ ) . 
  how can there be `` fair sharing '' of an undetermined number ? 
  british south african , not boer . 
  only for the students who are in the final year of lukio ( gymnasium ) ; the rest of the spring term is reserved for their matriculation exams . 
  for other students school ends may/june , as usual . 
  here 's a start : http://ukdataexplorer.com/european-translator/?word=strawberry, 
  but why , some say , fuck all white men ? 
  why choose this as our goal ? 
  and they may well ask why climb the highest mountain ? 
  why does rice play texas ? 
   the problem is , we ca n't give them everything they expect . 
  i do n't doubt it , since in many cases their expectations are too high even regarding western europe : http://www.ariva.de/asyl_a868424, 
  whatever it is , they 're not alone . 
  the official swedish statistics agency has underestimated immigration for every single year since 1973 ( [ source in swedish ] ( http://magasinetneo.se/artiklar/ge-mig-lagom-manga-av-era-trotta-och-era-fattiga/ ) ) . 
   rule of thumb being that if someone comes from a swedish-speaking family line , they 're pretty likely to have their family origins in sweden . 
  more likely than other finns , but there was also a lot of language switching and admixture with the local population , so it 's not a given that a swedish speaking finn will have mostly swedish ancestry . 
   they 'll start shipping them back to syria , or they 'll start shooting them . 
  why would they need to do that ? 
  many of them already have visas to russia , and russia is not so attractive to migrants that they 're in a danger of being overwhelmed . 
  and a majority of them are n't syrian - we 're even getting asylum seekers from india and nepal through russia . 
  most of the people fleeing the war are stuck in iraq . 
  according to iraqi officials [ `` a disproportionate number of those leaving are not among the displaced , but educated young men who can afford the journey . 
  '' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iraq-fears-a-brain-drain-as-middle-class-young-people-head-to-europe/2015/10/05/77d26ee4-620f-11e5-8475-781cc9851652_story.html ), 
  finland . 
  finland never changes ... 
  like lord of the flies , but whinier . 
  in sweden and finland school-age immigrants are put in preparatory classes for a year or more , and then transferred to normal schools . 
  naturally many of them do n't manage to catch up : http://www.thelocal.se/20120912/43182, 
  the government gets to say `` we 're taking in more lone child refugees than any other eu country ! '', 
  to boost their image as a moral superpower . 
  worked pretty well until recently : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/10/sweden-sharp-rise-child-refugees, 
   give you a finders-price ... danegeld for the danekr\u00e6 ? 
  up to 100k estimated rapes , much fewer reported :  an average of 15,670 rapes are reported annually to police , less than one-quarter of which result in a suspect being identified . 
   the picture showed a 19 year old athlete that 's not what the svt article says . 
  he 's 19 * now * , but the picture in question was taken 5 years ago , when he still would have been 14 or 15 ( but the other children in the photo were younger than that ), 
  such is life in glorious europa, 
  the average living standard is much lower in russia , as well . 
  by your reasoning it would be impossible to control russian migration to finland . 
  someone should point him to this article about [ disappointed iraqis queuing to get out of finland ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/disappointed_iraqis_cancel_asylum_applications/8479598 ) :  `` living here is so difficult because i ca n't [ get ] comfortable here because my camp is so bad in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 . 
  and i ca n't stay in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 . 
  when you need anything , we do n't find anything . 
  and my mom needs me again and i want to go for her . '', 
   i guess the people down voting me think i linked this because i 'm on a crusade against immigration . 
  i doubt it - it 's probably because regardless of the other merits of the article , it seems to project an attitude that some eu countries are n't good enough for the migrants to settle in and they should be allowed to pick and choose . 
  that tends to piss off people from the `` undesirable transit countries '' [ sic ] as well as the desired destination countries . 
  but in any case , you should n't be downvoted because of that . 
   some migrants are stuck in hungary & co instead dreamland ( i.e. 
  finland ) . 
  thanks based hungary, 
  yep - if [ sweden is any indication of the future ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/08/immigration-helps-explain-swedens-school-trouble/ ) , our school systems are n't necessarily going to fare any better at integrating large numbers of immigrants ( although that 's far from the only problem with swedish schools ) :  the change in pupil demographics due to immigration explains almost a third of the average decline between 2000 and 2012 : 19 per cent in mathematical literacy , 28 per cent in reading literacy , and 41 per cent in scientific literacy . 
  the effect is especially pronounced in recent years , coinciding with accelerating refugee immigration . 
  indeed , between 2009 and 2012 , 43 per cent of the average pisa score decline is explained by altered demographics : a full 29 per cent in mathematical literacy , 45 per cent in reading literacy , and 62 per cent in scientific literacy . 
   seems that they 're trying to destabilize finland . 
  in that case , why wait until the refugee flow from sweden died down ? 
  maybe they are taking advantage of the situation , but either way , it seems stupid to expect russia to save us from our own asylum policy . 
   if you work the welfare subsidies only fall half ( or even only 25 % ) as fast as you gain money in principle , that 's already the case for people receiving unemployment benefits in finland . 
  one can earn 300 euros/month on top of benefits , and every euro after that cuts benefits by 50 cents . 
  the problem for many is that irregular jobs will cause unpredictable delays in processing and sometimes a risk that subsidies will be denied altogether . 
  it also does n't apply to people on last-resort financial assistance . 
   the current chief of police is the former chief of migration , and he ( dan eliasson ) , introduced `` code 291 '' , which forbids the police from reporting on crime involving migrants must be nice , having the authority to cover up the results of his previous job ... 
   they should start to realize that every time they say they do n't approve of something finland plans , it makes the finnish people want it twice harder . 
  maybe they have , and they 're using reverse psychology because they prefer the finnish-swedish cooperation to finland joining nato ? 
   german jews obviously would have a hard time qualifying for refugee slots , as i doubt that a judge would buy that they are truly endangered . 
  maybe they should try claiming they 're [ homeschoolers ? 
  ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/us/home-schooling-german-family-allowed-stay-us/story?id=22788876 ), 
   i respect the education system in england but not the legal system , apparently, 
   can nothing be said about sweden without including an agenda against immigrants ? 
  yes , basically every other article in helsingin sanomat . 
  every now and again they manage to put their foot in their mouth , like the `` nicknames for estonians '' cringefest ( come to think of it , that was also in their monthly supplement ), 
   finnish is like a more archaic version of estonian . 
  i was at a presentation by the estonian author jaan kaplinski in the 90s . 
  afterwards , someone asked him if he thought estonian would get influenced by finnish as a result of increased interaction after the fall of the soviet union . 
  he said that he did n't think so , because for estonian it would mean going backwards :d, 
   as a welsh person , i do n't consider myself to be part of `` iso-britannia '' , as that would lump us together with the english . 
  `` iso-britannia '' just means `` great britain '' , the name of the island that includes wales . 
  if you do n't consider yourself part of [ the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland ) , you 'd best take it up with the current leadership , 
   un could for once make itself useful and organize asylum in countries farther away . 
  the un already has [ a resettlement program for refugees ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a16b1676.html ) . 
  some syrian refugees have been settled as far as uruguay - and are now [ protesting because they want to leave the country ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syrian-refugees-uruguay-protest-leave-country-1892896774 ) . 
  ( i 'm not trying to imply that refugees are generally that choosy , but it shows that problems with resettlement are n't limited to asylum seekers in europe . ), 
  on the 21st day of christmas , my true love sent to me : a bus full of refugees . 
  the seals dig and maintain breathing holes with the claws on their front flippers , but apparently they can only do it from under the ice . 
  it 's funny that we worry so much about romanian corruption polluting our precious ~ ~ bodily fluids ~ ~ schengen , and at the same time we let people from [ the most corrupt countries on the planet ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/12/five-arab-states-top-most-corrupt-list-201312353328911685.html ) cross schengen borders at will , often with the assistance of organised crime . 
  actually it 's pretty absurd that `` eu migrants '' in western europe are begging in the streets , while many non-eu citizens without documentation are eligible for an all-expenses-paid stay . 
  even if the roma are often resistant to integration , maybe it would make more sense to expend our resources on them . 
   at this point no witnesses had come forward to say anything they did have witnesses - the journalist was tipped off by a psychologist working with the victims and was in contact with a police officer who had been on the scene . 
  it 's not clear if dn even actively asked the police about these specific allegations - their [ explanation ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fragor-och-svar-om-dns-hantering-av-handelserna-i-kungstradgarden/ ) implies they simply relied on the initial press release which claimed that the festival had been peaceful .
