  the underlying problem is that our justice systems and other policies were developed to deal with populations of mostly secular westerners , and they work pretty well for that purpose , but very poorly when dealing with large dysfunctional multicultural enclaves . 
   furthermore , all adjectives used in the quran to refer to the houris can be applied to both females and males ( i.e. , `` splendid '' , `` pure '' , `` companions '' `` modest '' , `` wide-eyed '' , `` gazelle-eyed '' , and even `` large-breasted '' ) .

  once refugees are granted their residence permits , they are free to settle anywhere , just like other swedish residents . 
  what commonly happens is that when refugees have received their permits , the city has to * offer * them housing , and there simply is n't anything else available on short notice except the old run-down suburbs . 
  if you want public housing at a more attractive location , you usually have to be a student or be willing to queue for several years , since all of the bigger cities have a housing shortage . 
  [ here are some queue times for public housing ] ( http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.2307526-sa-lang-tid-tar-bostadskoandet ) in the more popular parts of gothenburg :  haga : 8 years  masthugget and kungsladug\u00e5rd : 6 years  majorna : 5,5 years  torpa : a little over 5 years  kaver\u00f6s , h\u00f6gsbo , bagareg\u00e5rden : almost 5 years  v\u00e4stra j\u00e4rnbrott , guldheden : a little over 4 years does this help understand why the city could n't simply `` send '' your relatives to a more central area ? 
   sweden 's attempt at taking in refugees is to essentially send them to isolated poor ghettos where the chances of making something out of yourself is low . 
  they are n't `` sent '' to ghettos . 
  they end up there because of the lack of affordable housing elsewhere .

  let sweden take the other half , it 's only fair . 
  the cuts were closer to a third than a half of development aid , and mostly affected projects by finnish ngos and direct funding to countries like mozambique . 
  only a small part of development aid is spent on funding for refugee camps and other humanitarian aid . 
  it 's mainly for people with a medical condition that might attract unwanted attention : for example , psoriasis sufferers or people who 've had a mastectomy are allowed keep their swimsuits on . 
  foreign students are n't considered permanent residents . 
  foreigners with permanent residency are generally entitled to same benefits as finns . 
  it would be if they 're talking about income tax , but if employer contributions are included in the calculation , it might not be entirely outrageous . 
  finnish social security is based on residency , so it probably would n't be limited to citizens : / ( however , the current news is only about drawing up plans for an experiment about basic income : it 's nowhere near implementation yet . ), 
  most european countries already grant temporary residence permits to start with , sweden is an exception with permanent residence to syrians . 
  but most of the time the permits get renewed as a matter of course . 
  it 's not just politicians using this tactic . 
  many people do n't like to admit they were fooled , so it 's a convenient rationalization to say they could n't speak up earlier because of ` dumb nazis ' . 
  before : `` it 's silly to be concerned about so-called ` mass migration ' when there are hardly any immigrants in your country : it 's only xenophobia '' after : `` it 's silly to be concerned about mass migration when so many immigrants are already here : it 's only racism '', 
   again you have the free choice but also need to consider the consequences . 
  the opposing countries * are * considering the consequences of creating a permanent system of forced distribution of irregular migrants within eu , that 's why they 're rejecting it . 
  each of those approaches makes sense in its own context , but combining them under one union is bound to disappoint both types of expectations . 
   as soon as poland is $ 1 above the eu average and might have to pay more than they receive , they 'll become the worst eurosceptics ... sweden , denmark and finland are net contributors , and look at them : /,

    except the eu will not be sending them back  normally , you need a military and some logistical resources to do that . 
  let 's be honest , you dudes have no such resources . 
  with the exception of hungary , our resources are either sitting idle , helping funnel even more migrants into europe ( as they were during operation mare nostrum ) , or overseeing the migration from one eu country to another . 
  the issue is not lack of military spending .

   so , austerity for european citizens is mandatory but it comes to providing welfare for others ( i repeat , only 20 % syrians ) , rules are overlooked .

  from today 's article by johan hakelius on [ the same phenomenon ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/johanhakelius/article21647404.ab ) :  positions which only a few months ago were considered to be close to the limits of decency are now in the center of the agreement between the six parties . 
  the approach is clear : the stream of refugees must be made to subside . 
  it 's not possible to go on like this much longer . 
   it is almost magical and very swedish . 
  suddenly the corridor swings . 
  what was suspect to say a month ago , is suddenly common sense in the middle of the opinion corridor . 
  in sweden , some mainstream journalists have admitted they contributed to suppressing debate about the problematic aspects of migration in the past . 
  for example , [ ann-charlotte marteus ] ( http://www.expressen.se/ledare/ann-charlotte-marteus/det-ar-jag-som-ar-asiktskorridoren/ ) : `` i helped build the corridor that has prevented a constructive debate on migration and integration '' ( * \u00c5siktskorridoren * or `` the opinion corridor '' is a swedish expression for the span of `` allowed '' opinions ), 
  and meanwhile asylum seekers are being flown from italy to sweden according to the earlier quota . 
  with a new quota , maybe you can fly them back out again ? 
  lol , this relocation scheme is such a farce . 
   we have absolutely different experience with nationalism here in europe what do you mean ` we ' , kemosabe ? 
  the simplest would be to expand the existing resettlement quotas for un refugees , instead of trying to create a parallel quota system for asylum seekers . 
  and how is that working out ? 
  they 're already over capacity in many things ( for housing , schools , teachers , processing of applications ... even mattresses ) , and there 's no way for them to suddenly stop accepting asylum seekers without legal changes . 
  it 's possible to disincentivize them , but that also takes some time to take effect . 
  many of the recent arrivals will also be looking to bring their families in . 
  by `` stepping up '' , do you mean create even more perverse incentives for people to smuggle themselves to europe ? 
  [ about that ... ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20151016/isis-graffiti-scares-syrians-in-gothenburg )  jacob asmar and his family discovered the message `` convert or die '' scrawled on the walls of their pizzeria in red paint earlier this week .

  germany [ passed asylum restrictions ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) during the balkan crisis . 
   the goal of the 1993 amendment of the basic law aimed to continue to provide protection for foreigners who really are victims of political persecution , whilst preventing abuse of asylum . 
  it was needed because of the sharp increase in the number of asylum applicants , reaching almost 440,000 in the previous year . 
   when you get into bed with the germans ** for money ** . 
  that 's the worst of it , there was n't even any short term benefit . 
  finland will enforce the rules ( or what eu top cats claim `` the rules '' are at any given moment ) to its own detriment .

  there 's no guarantee germany will be able to settle them close to their friends or relatives , either . 
  pretty good first approximation . 
  there 's a lot of overlap between the nationalist and agrarian , and to some extent the pro-business factions in finland . 
  the precursor of the populist [ finns party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns_party ) was the finnish rural party . 
  the [ centre party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_ ( finland ) is also identified with the countryside and with localist politics , but their current politics are pretty closely aligned with the pro-business [ national coalition .
