  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_coalition_party ), 
  think of them as sources of admixture rather than categories . 
  most europeans are a mix of the three in various proportions , except sardinians seem to be nearly exclusively early european farmer . 
  eef originated from a neolithic migration from the near east that brought agriculture into europe . 
  more like ( northern ) [ russians can into finnic .

  it 's the circle of life ... otoh , feeding closely related animals to each other could increase the risk of prion diseases ( similar to `` mad cow '' disease ) spreading in the zoo population , so it might not be advisable to feed tigers lion meat or vice versa . 
   do we have so many lions in the nature , that we kill them in the zoo ? 
  yes , because habitat loss is a bigger threat to wild lions than low population size . 
  even south african game reserves have [ culled lions ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1505784/lions-culled-at-south-african-park.html ) . 
   this zoo failed in it 's mission . 
  many ( if not most ) zoos cull animals on the quiet - imo , this zoo should be commended for being open about it . 
  * nations * with small populations , yes . 
  enclaves that do n't see themselves as [ part of the same nation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm4aymz029w ) , not so much . 
   letting people experience your culture and values swedish culture or swedish values do n't exist . 
  only barbarism is originally swedish . 
  swedes must be integrated into the new sweden , because the old sweden is n't coming back . 
   we spent two years pretending the problem did n't exist , until it burst down our doors . 
  sweden started granting syrian asylum seekers permanent residency [ two years ago ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130903/50030 ) , but ( much like germany ) did n't consider how that would act as an additional pull factor . 
  rather than being passive actors in the crisis , they added to the incentives that contributed to the border states getting overwhelmed . 
  they wo n't do that anyway , since most will remain as net recipients of tax money . 
   genetically the finns are still largely germanic like the scandinavians though . 
  slight nitpick : it 's unlikely that there has been a large germanic contribution to finnish genetics , since the y chromosome haplogroup distributions [ are quite different ] ( https://pastmist.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/__y-map.gif ) . 
  finns do largely share the gene pool of other northern europeans when comparing nuclear genetic markers , but are a bit [ `` special '' ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/nord3.png ) due to genetic bottlenecks and uralic influence . 
   all the nordics as well as estonia are very atheistic . 
  depends on what the comparison is . 
  according to [ one study ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/win-gallup-religiosity-map.jpg/550px-win-gallup-religiosity-map.jpg ) , over half of finns and icelanders described themselves as religious but less than 30 % of swedes did ( the other nordics were n't included ) . 
  but , like you said , any kind of religious zeal is very rare . 
  do n't take it personally , most people have had little interaction with romanians and bulgarians apart from the romani beggars ( even if there are n't that many , it 's hard to miss them ) . 
  it 's like getting a bad impression of nigerians after encountering a bunch of online scammers . 
  the more she tightens her grip , the more countries will slip through her fingers ? 
   all these , i think , is a fair exchange . 
  free movement for people from outside the union was never part of any deal . 
  nordic countries have had free movement since the 1950s , but it would have been considered insane if finland had let in 500000 russian migrants after the fall of the soviet union and then demanded that the other countries `` share the burden '' for them . 
  moss is available wherever logs are , insulates well and `` breathes '' ( expands and contracts ) along with the logs . 
  the most common [ moss species ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleurozium_schreberi ) in finland is called `` wall moss '' in finnish because of the traditional use . 
  is it because of lack of interest , or lack of funds for hiring or training ? 
  teaching is still a relatively attractive profession in finland - there 's some shortage of qualified special needs teachers at the moment , but i think it 's mostly due to lack of training spots . 
  ( those school assistants do n't need to be qualified teachers , though . 
  there 's a shorter vocational training for them ), 
   saying `` i will spend a lot of money to overhaul the system to improve the integration of sons of immigrants '' would be the political death of politicians in a lot of european countries , even if the consequences are positives and possibly pay by themselves in the long run . 
  sweden has tried [ throwing money at the problem ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20120912/43182 ) . 
  certain schools in areas with a lot of immigrants get almost double the funding per student compared to the least funded schools . 
  despite that , the achievement gap keeps growing ( although the results of native swedes keep getting worse as well ) . 
  i did a brief stint teaching at a finnish school recently , and surprisingly many of the immigrant students had special needs assistants trailing after them . 
  ( the service is not only for immigrants , but many of them end up needing it because of language or other difficulties . ), 
  with a growing number of immigrants , it 's going to get more and more difficult to afford such personal attention to individual students . 
  makes sense in a high trust society . 
  washington post report [ on the people leaving iraq  ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iraq-fears-a-brain-drain-as-middle-class-young-people-head-to-europe/2015/10/05/77d26ee4-620f-11e5-8475-781cc9851652_story.html )  iraqi officials , however , say a disproportionate number of those leaving are not among the displaced , but educated young men who can afford the journey . 
   meanwhile , in iraq 's camps for the displaced , many who have been forced to flee their homes because of islamic state 's advance say they are trapped -- europe is just a distant dream . 
  sweden has the same problem , although they have [ the best integration policy `` on paper '' ] ( http://migrantreport.org/sweden-portugal-lead-integration-policy/ ) . 
  i do n't think ghettoization is avoidable considering the numbers of immigrants sweden or germany have taken in , cultural differences , and the distribution of available housing . 
   let 's start selling maps in the middle east without norway on it . 
  like in the old [ euro coins ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3880/14954412361_b305995594_o.jpg ) , then ? 
  might work as an additional deterrent ( or not ? ), 
  [ the finnish president says ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/presidentti-niinisto-maailmalla-ei-tajuta-suomen-pakolaistilannetta/5341532 ) most foreign officials are under the impression finland has taken 2000-3000 asylum seekers , at most . 
  an unnamed highly placed german had asked him if they 're coming from russia !, 
  is n't it time to stop sucking up to these delusional twits already ? 
  it 's a negative sum game . 
  in order to accommodate that many asylum seekers , we 'll be forced to tear up the social safety net that attracted them in the first place . 
   most countries in europe have a minimum wage ( and those who do n't have strong unions and labor laws ) controlling labor immigration has historically played a part in that . 
  that control is now being dismantled in many countries by giving asylum seekers the right to work soon after arrival . 
  there 's also talk of weakening labor regulations , since most asylum seekers ca n't compete in the current job market . 
  judging by their actions during the migrant crisis , what do you expect them to do if the shit really hits the fan ? 
  it 's already possible to invite refugees straight from the camps via the un quota . 
  until recently , only 6 eu countries did so . 
  opening up legal travel for asylum seekers would only increase the problem 10-fold . 
  eu politicians are not * quite * that insane yet . 
   if finland declines asylum seekers we do n't get nato membership was hungary kicked out of nato after they put up the fence ? 
  i must have missed the news . 
  besides , finland has already taken many times the asylum seekers we agreed to in that stupid quota charade . 
  we 'll just issue the russians free train tickets to the swedish border  sweden belongs to all !, 
  there 's no minimum wage as such , but most fields are covered by collective bargaining agreements which are politically difficult to change . 
  exports are not very diverse , so the economy has less of an ability to adapt in case of a crisis . 
  and there are relatively few low-skilled or entry-level positions available at all . 
  yes , there are over 400 000 unemployed , and politicians are falling over themselves promising asylum seekers jobs and apartments . 
  ffs . 
  asylum applications from iraqis and somalis have been put on hold until the rules have been reviewed . 
  but readjusting the rules wo n't help much , unless we can negotiate a readmission agreement with iraq ( which sweden has ) . 
  in any event , hosting the asylum seekers will end up eating a large chunk of the savings from the recent government spending cuts . 
  sounds like a plan . 
  [ tar flavored candy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terva_leijona ) , [ tar chewing gum ] ( http://theslate.net/2008/12/07/chewing-tar/ ) , [ tar schnapps ] ( http://monkeysandmountains.com/finnish-drinks ) , [ tar ice cream ... ] ( http://coldcoldercoldest.blogspot.fi/2010/05/tar-ice-cream-finlands-madeleine.html ) also , [ deadly poisonous mushrooms ] ( http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/morel.htm ) that are considered a delicacy after the right treatment . 
  probably pearl barley . 
  that 's what triggered the protest , according to the news ( it was served as a side dish ), 
  actually , genetic integrity comes up a lot in conservation genetics and related fields . 
  in these two studies , for example : [ loss of genetic integrity in wild lake trout populations following stocking : insights from an exhaustive study of 72 lakes from qu\u00e9bec , canada ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4105915/ ) [ the genetic integrity of the ex situ population of the european wildcat ( felis silvestris silvestris ) is seriously threatened by introgression from domestic cats ( felis silvestris catus ) ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106083 ) it would n't be ethical to try to preserve the differences between human populations in the way we try to preserve other animal populations , but it 's a valid concept . 
   most of the chatter or / r/europe is about how bad muslims are but if we do n't help these people , if we ca n't protect apostates , we are offering no space for islam to grow . 
  imo , it 's not fair towards apostates to cast them in the role of reforming islam . 
  we should help apostates regardless of whether it will lead to a more tolerant islam or not . 
  however , we should also help liberal and secular muslims , who are facing some of the same issues as apostates are . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.channel24.co.za/tv/news/5-things-americans-need-to-know-about-trevor-noah-20150330 ) says he speaks 7 languages : english , afrikaans , zulu , xhosa , tswana , tsonga and german . 
  xhosa and zulu are very closely related , tswana and tsonga more distant . 
  based on knowing those 4 , it 's likely that he also understands other related languages ( like sotho ) to some degree . 
  this `` evil '' is what allows humans and other social animals to band together and cooperate in the first place . 
  the flip side is that it also allows them to band together and cooperate against others of their kind , but that 's not a separate phenomenon from the more apparently benevolent forms of cooperation . 
  the refugee convention does n't apply to every person coming from a violent shithole , it 's for those who are at risk of being personally persecuted and unable to claim protection from their home country . 
  even offering this level of protection might turn out to be unsustainable in the long run , but not as untenable as trying to take in every single person `` fleeing from harm '' . 
  so why should people give shit about whether french university graduates can hang out with all of their `` classmates '' 6 months after graduation ... ? 
   uni graduates that did n't have a job in 6 months , had to leave . 
  this created a completely unbearable system for professors , students and everybody .
