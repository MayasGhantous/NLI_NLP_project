  a 6 month grace period is `` unbearable '' ? 
  give me a break . 
  my visa to the us expired the same day as my postdoc contract did . 
  students in the us have [ 30 to 60 days ] ( http://isss.gsu.edu/current-students/immigration-advising/grace-periods/ ) after finishing their programs to leave to us or to find another reason to be granted a visa . 
  it would seem that they have a pretty good idea of how trying to become restrictive on immigration works , but the southern border is porous enough ( and some powerful interest groups like cheap labor enough ) to allow people to slip through the cracks in addition to the very tightly controlled legal immigration channels . 
  `` fresh , strong-limbed and rough , a maiden raised in the woods , supple and pleasant besides ; only her mouth is too wide . '', 
   most secular country in europe on the brink of becoming a theocracy !, 
  nobody expects the french inquisition !, 
  note the full definition :  a person who comes to a country to take up permanent residence all migrants are n't immigrants . 
  it can still be a good idea for a state to offer education to non-immigrants , but they do n't always have an automatic right to it . 
   give education to immigrants are they immigrants ? 
  have the parents claimed asylum in greece ? 
   literally nobody knows what will happen within a ( significantly ) shrinking population , as there is no precedent for it yet . 
  it happened during the black death . 
  the resulting shortage of labor spurred invention of labor-saving technologies and better conditions for the remaining workers . 
  but if we 're to believe the scaremongers , we 're now less adaptable and innovative than medieval peasants , and the only possible solution is to import more people ? 
   if they 're not going to leave , then what else is there to do ? 
  basic welfare should n't be unconditional but given temporarily on condition that the failed immigrant cooperates with authorities until they can be removed from the country . 
  natives have to jump through many bureaucratic hoops to get basic welfare , it will erode social trust if illegal immigrants are allowed to essentially blackmail their way into it . 
   it was the reason for the widespread culls , that resulted in the current state where there have been no fatalities . 
  it seems you 're getting downvoted on feels , since it 's hard to argue with the facts . 
  well-meaning people used to use the same argument against bear-hunting in finland , until a jogger was killed by a bear in 1998 , after a century with no fatalities ( coinciding with very low bear numbers ) . 
  we are n't doing conservation any favors in the long run by pretending the risk ( although small ) is n't real . 
  as long as there 's a reasonable chance to bypass existing immigration controls by `` coming to our borders '' , people will keep coming to your borders , redistribution or no redistribution . 
  accepting refugees only through unhcr in a controlled way would considerably reduce the incentives for irregular immigration . 
  if only there was some kind of established [ resettlement program for refugees ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/resettlement.html ) ... 
  tl ; dr of the ft article for those behind paywall :  life expectancy in a swath of african countries since 2000 surged by between 20 and 42 per cent , providing an upbeat counterpoint to the gloom increasingly enveloping the continent . 
   the recent [ economic ] slowdown ... led to the perception that the entire africa rising phenomenon was driven more by the cyclical upswing in commodity prices than any longer-lasting structural improvements in african economies . 
   however , dramatic rises in life expectancy suggest many governments , aided by external donors such as the bill & melinda gates foundation , have been able to improve their health systems and the wellbeing of their populace . 
   africa , of course , had more scope to raise life expectancy , given most its countries were starting from a lower base than typically found elsewhere in the world . 
   however the figures are a marked contrast from the 1990s , when life expectancy fell sharply in countries such as zimbabwe , botswana , the republic of congo , kenya , namibia and the central african republic , and only edged up in many others . 
   the hiv/aids epidemic was a major killer then , and efforts to prevent infection and prolong the lives of those infected have played a part in the subsequent rebound in longevity since 2000 . 
   everybody accepts that a massively ageing population is bad for economic growth and quality of life . 
  financial times had an article earlier this year praising [ increasing lifespans in africa ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/38c2ad3e-0874-11e6-b6d3-746f8e9cdd33 ) as `` an upbeat counterpoint to the gloom increasingly enveloping the continent '' . 
  if everyone accepts that ageing populations are bad , why are we constantly striving to extend human lifespan and make birth control more accessible ? 
  populations are aging everywhere , and when fertility goes down ( as it should , and must ) it will create a temporary `` hump '' of even more old people . 
  europe and japan are further along this path than most places , but all regions are going to need to deal with this situation eventually . 
  the need to eventually reach and sustain replacement fertility is a slightly different aspect of the same issue , but the lack of incentives for having children ca n't be fixed by immigration . 
  it 's not that we * want * to be scandinavians , but many consider it futile to keep picking nits over it when most furriners do n't understand the difference anyway . 
  the author is referring to the fact that these adults were housed in accommodations reserved for underage children . 
  there they have easier access to vulnerable victims and the staff may be inadequately prepared to handle the situation . 
  and i was referring to the symbol , dummy . 
  in what other sense could a country even be considered a `` boy '' or a `` girl '' ? 
   suomi-neito also does n't tell the gender of finland . 
  : ddd  why is it even such a big deal ? 
  you tell me , you 're the one who keeps downvoting over a joke argument :d, 
  that 's in the possessive sense : `` land of our fathers '' , it does n't specify finland 's gender . 
  you never heard of suomi-neito ? 
  how does that contradict what i said ? 
   since when was finland a `` girl '' [ since the 19th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_maiden ), 
   roughly the same distance to both i think very roughly yes , at least if you select finns from the [ opposite ends of the genetic distribution ] ( http://britam.org/dna/fimmdna.jpg ) . 
  this should n't be interpreted as western and eastern finns necessarily having very different ancestors : especially in finns from the northeast , the genetic distances to the rest of the country are inflated due to known population bottlenecks in recent history ( although sami admixture could have played some part as well ) . 
  sweden also appears to be slightly `` stretched '' towards the `` finnic '' direction ( clearer in [ this analysis ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/nord3.png ) ) , so we should be careful of assuming the influences only went one way . 
   not in the sense that it 's somehow necessarily better abstractly , in all cases . 
  you 're correct that it 's not inherent in the definition , but some proponents of ( normative ) multiculturalism do argue that diversity in itself is desirable : http://www.unesco.org/most/migration/glossary_multiculturalism.htm  the ideological-normative usage of multiculturalism is that which generates the greatest level of debate since it constitutes a slogan and model for political action based on sociological theorising and ethical-philosophical consideration about the place of those with culturally distinct identities in contemporary society . 
  multiculturalism emphasises that acknowledging the existence of ethnic diversity and ensuring the rights of individuals to retain their culture should go hand in hand with enjoying full access to , participation in , and adherence to , constitutional principles and commonly shared values prevailing in the society . 
  by acknowledging the rights of individuals and groups and ensuring their equitable access to society , advocates of multiculturalism also maintain that such a policy benefits both individuals and the larger society by reducing pressures for social conflict based on disadvantage and inequality . 
  ** they also argue that multiculturalism is an enrichment for the society as a whole . 
  ** the close parallels between this ideological-normative usage of multiculturalism and the united nations ' views on cultural diversity are clear . 
  http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/11559-foreign-men-are-in-high-demand-in-finland.html  todd , a 25-year-old engineer from australia , describes his recent nine-week business trip to finland as unforgettable . 
  ( ... ) finnish women , he estimates , must simply love the australian accent as they were not afraid to make the initiative . 
  any such benefit would also need to be compared against the considerable social and personal cost associated with a person taking years to finish a higher degree only to end up in a low-skilled job . 
  i 'm curious how many of the people promoting this viewpoint would themselves be happy to end up as a garbageman with an advanced degree . 
  is `` korke 's drift '' an intentional or an unintentional [ misspelling ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_rorke%27s_drift ), 
  the 9000 year date comes from dead wood on the same spot , not from living roots . 
  the wood could be from the same individual that has been vegetatively regenerating , but that has n't been confirmed . 
  and not just the [ protests  ( http://www.businessinsider.com/jean-claude-juncker-borders-european-union-immigration-2016-8?r=us&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t )  speaking at the european forum alpbach on monday , jean-claude juncker called on europe to show `` solidarity '' with refugees and described borders as the `` worst invention '' ever produced by politicians . 
  in addition to the ancient north eurasian component shared with other europeans , finns have a more recent layer of north asian admixture , likely related to the spread of uralic languages in europe . 
  from [ lazaridis et al. 
  2014 ] ( https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reich/reich_lab/welcome_files/2014_nature_lazaridis_europethreeancestries.pdf ) :  finns , mordovians and russians ( from the north-west of russia ) also do not fit ( supplementary information section 14 ; extended data table 3 ) due to east eurasian gene flow into the ancestors of these north-eastern european populations . 
  these populations ( and chuvash and saami ) are more related to east asians than can be explained by ane admixture ( extended data fig . 
  7 ) , probably reflecting a separate stream of siberian gene flow into north-eastern europe ( supplementary information section 14 ) . 
  ( `` do not fit '' refers to these populations not fitting the three-population admixture model used for other europeans in the paper ), 
   russian karelia is about 80-90 % ethnic russian that 's due to recent population transfers , though . 
  it used to be populated by people closely related to eastern finns . 
   i do n't understand your definition for dark , being brown haired and having brown eyes does not make one dark . 
  in finnish , calling a person `` dark '' typically means something like brunette , not dark-skinned . 
  although it could also mean romani/gypsy . 
  eesti can into [ west european hunter gatherer more than west europeans ] ( http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7555/fig_tab/nature14317_f3.html ) , how 's that ? 
  yeah , that was a bit unclear on my part . 
  i meant that as a comment on op 's title : although the study found that finns are distinct from other populations in the * frequency * of certain types of genetic variants , they are not claiming that the finnish genetic pool as a whole is so distinct on a global scale that it belongs in its own sub-group ( although that might be true on a european scale ) . 
   however , it 's unlikely they have representative samples from all populations in the world . 
  that 's true , the data was gathered from various disease-focused sequencing projects and more than half of the samples are from people of european descent , as seen in fig . 
  it 's likely that they missed a lot of the world 's genetically isolated populations . 
   surely they would see big differences between the bushmen and nandi ? 
  they would if they looked at genetic similarity over the whole genome , but not necessarily in the kinds of comparisons they did in this study . 
  the types of mutations to accumulate in each population would depend on how their population sizes have varied historically . 
  different from other europeans , not the rest of the world . 
   we further separated europeans into individuals of finnish and non-finnish ancestry given the enrichment of this bottlenecked population ; the term european hereafter refers to non-finnish european individuals . 
  they may not fit the definition of neet if they have part-time jobs : working one hour per week is enough to be counted as employed in [ eu statistics . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/eu_labour_force_survey_-_methodology ), 
  one example is oecd 's [ `` better life index '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oecd_better_life_index ) . 
  us and the nordic countries all rank pretty close to each other , but with [ higher wealth and income inequality in the us ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/05/daily-chart-17 ) , nordic americans can score higher than people in `` the old country '' if they tend to be among the more well-off americans .

   even with the higher tax rate , this frees up a fuckton of money for consumer spending . 
  in that case , should n't consumer spending be higher in the nordic countries than [ in the us ?
