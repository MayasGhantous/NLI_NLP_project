   you should n't have skipped your swedish lessons . 
  the article is about seasonal workers and others temporarily working here , which correctly often do n't need to know swedish they 're still employable , are n't they ? 
  and cut the attitude , i 've worked in det l\u00e5nga landet falukorv myself . 
  ( i did n't actually * need * to know swedish for the position , though , since the working language was english . ), 
  * stats over [ work permits ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/om-migrationsverket/statistik/arbetstagare---de-storsta-yrkesgrupperna.html ) would also indicate that white collar jobs are available for non-swedish speakers alongside berry picking and other low-paid work . 
  ** obviously there are also many jobs where a near-native command of swedish is necessary , but the `` school swedish '' taught in finland typically wo n't be enough to prepare a student for them . 
   their english will only be improved by learning a language with similar grammar and vocabulary would n't it be improved even more by taking additional english lessons ? 
   making you employable in the rest of the nordic countries germans , poles and lithuanians among others seem to [ manage it ] ( http://www.europaportalen.se/2015/02/fordubbling-av-utlandska-arbetare-i-sverige ) without mandatory swedish . 
   making it easier for you to learn english ( and other germanic languages ) ? 
  almost all finnish-speaking students start learning english before swedish . 
  with mandatory swedish , the most common foreign language combination is english + swedish + german . 
  nothing wrong with germanic languages , but having a bit more diversity in the languages studied could be useful . 
   they took in over a million last year germany is large , their `` one million '' pales in comparison to [ a lot of other places .

  vitamin d deficiency ? 
   it has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world at 20 % . 
  the us has one of the highest : 76.6 % of prisoners are re-arrested within five years . 
  how many get resentenced , though ? 
  the norwegian figure refers to new convictions , not arrests : www.kriminalomsorgen.no/getfile.php/2819934.823.xpewptatwc/nordic+relapse+study+abstract+.pdf  within two years a fifth of all released from prison and among those who began serving a sentence in the community in norway incurred a new conviction that had to be served in the correctional services . 
  * this report also offers some less flattering details on the success of norwegian prisons :  while the majority of correctional clients in sweden serve their punishment in probation , only one fourth of the norwegian clients do so . 
  when large groups of sentenced persons with a low reoffending risk are transferred to probation , such as in sweden , prisons will increasingly be left with a more troubled clientele with a higher reoffending risk , as demonstrated by the fact that almost half of the released prisoners in sweden are formerly sentenced to prison . 
  conversely , ** there is a large group of low risk traffic offenders among released prisoners ** in norway , strongly contributing to the low reoffending rate among released prisoners in norway . 
  do you know how they control for foreigners who are deported or otherwise leave the country in measuring recidivism rates ? 
   however , this site proves a strong trade link between the british isles and the mediterranean world a thousand years before pytheas was even born . 
  there 's also evidence of [ copper from cyprus ] ( http://www.mining.com/bronze-age-axes-made-with-copper-from-cyprus/ ) being traded in scandinavia in the same period . 
  in this case the geese are actually wild geese . 
   sousa and labourdette figured out how to ditch the force-feeding -- their product is made from wild geese who touch down in spain once a year to gorge themselves on acorns and olives before flying south for the winter . 
  from a conservation perspective , it 's still a good thing , if it makes local populations more positive for preservation of the geese in the long run without having too big of an impact on the population . 
  it 's based on the number of [ asylum applications ] ( http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/hungary/asylum-procedure/procedures/regular-procedure ) in each country . 
   germany has received the most refugees not [ per capita . 
  ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/db17/production/_88578065_asylum_claims_per_capita_624gr.png ), 
   taking into account how many hungarians migrated to other countries recently , i think hungary need migrants more than ever . 
  if people are leaving because of a lack of opportunities in hungary , wo n't migrants be faced with the same problem ? 
   i wonder if this is the first time that collective human altruism has led to such poor results . 
  what about the [ moriori ?

   no , it exists in case your own country will go into war in the future . 
  war is not sufficient grounds for asylum . 
  there are [ other treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geneva_conventions ) meant to ensure the protection of civilians during wartime . 
  if your country is taken over by a force that does n't respect the conventions and starts persecuting your citizens , then they have grounds for asylum , but encouraging your civilian population to escape before that happens is probably detrimental to the war effort . 
  the concern is that northern forests may [ take centuries to regenerate ] ( http://phys.org/news/2016-07-russian-wildfires-key-climate-resource.html ) after a wildfire ( i do n't know why the article talks about `` shallow roots '' being damaged by the fires , though : these forests do n't regenerate from the roots in any case . ), 
  then again , deforestation in the north might actually have a [ net cooling effect ] ( http://science.time.com/2011/11/16/how-some-deforestation-might-slow-warming/ ) on the climate , since dark conifer forests trap more heat than other types of vegetation . 
   many ** asians ** still get asked `` where are you from , no * where are you really from ? 
  * '' as long as we call groups of people after geographic origin , is it any wonder that people associate them with geographic origin ? 
  besides , if you 're talking about asians in america , the majority of them were [ born abroad ] ( http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/ ) , so it 's not strange that people would make that assumption about them ( or any other group of largely recent immigrant extraction ) . 
  i do n't think evidence is strong enough either way , is that `` retarded '' according to you ? 
   we get people saying that turks , iranians etc born and raised in europe still are n't really european and do n't belong here oh , the horror . 
  by that reasoning , white people born in africa are justified in lashing out violently because many do n't consider them truly african . 
  true . 
  otoh , there 's no more evidence that he was bullied by the far right , and yet [ a comment stating it as a fact ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u7qke/munich_gunman_was_obsessed_with_mass_shootings_no/d5nip6b ) has upwards of 170 upvotes at the moment . 
  seems to be a bit of a double standard at work . 
  http://www.iranchamber.com/geography/articles/persia_became_iran.php  the suggestion for the change is said to have come from the iranian ambassador to germany , who came under the influence of the nazis . 
  at the time germany was in the grip of racial fever and cultivated good relations with nations of `` aryan '' blood . 
  it is said that some german friends of the ambassador persuaded him that , as with the advent of reza shah , persia had turned a new leaf in its history and had freed itself from the pernicious influences of britain and russia , whose interventions in persian affairs had practically crippled the country under the qajars , it was only fitting that the country be called by its own name , `` iran . '', 
  this would not only signal a new beginning and bring home to the world the new era in iranian history , but would also signify the aryan race of its population , as `` iran '' is a cognate of `` aryan '' and derived from it . 
   nationalism is a very modern ideology , barely couple of hundred years old , compared to million years of migrations and mixing . 
  what do you mean `` compared to '' ? 
  migration and mixing have been vastly accelerated in modern times ( as evidenced by human genetics ) . 
  ethnic mixing presupposes there 's something to mix : there has been constant differentiation along with mixing , otherwise we would n't have different ethnicities in the first place . 
   for example alexander the great after having conquered the east forced a policy of intermarriage between the greeks and the persians . 
  yet greeks and persians still exist as distinct ethnicities . 
  ( also consider why intermarriage had to be * forced * , if ethnic mixing was the rule back then ? ), 
  [ misinformation tends to stick . 
  ] ( http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/misinformation-psychological-science-shows-why-it-sticks-and-how-to-fix-it.html ) many people will likely end up believing the first story even after the media get around to correcting themselves . 
  [ v\u00e4in\u00f6 myllyrinne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4in%c3%b6_myllyrinne ), 
   under no circumstances is `` staying to fight '' the optimal outcome , for either women or men . 
  that is not a viable option . 
  i guess someone forgot to tell [ these women ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-in-iraq-the-women-kurd-and-yazidi-fighters-that-put-the-fear-into-jihadis-because-theyll-rob-a6977761.html ) :  the all-women or ` jin ' unit based in kananshor village near sinjar mountain is home to a rotating group of female fighters , who are particularly feared by isis fighters , who believe that if they are killed by a woman they will not get to heaven . 
   `` i came to kick isis out of these lands , '' an 18-year-old fighter named rozaline explains . 
  `` i came for the yazidi women . 
  i saw them cutting women 's heads off in rojava [ what kurds call the three kurdish enclaves just south of the turkish border in syria ] . 
  i saw so many awful things . 
  i do n't want to see any more cutting and killing '' . 
  monstrous , right ? 
   being a refugee means you are leaving danger it means you are fleeing the threat of being persecuted as an individual . 
  civil war or other non-personal danger is not in itself grounds for refugee status . 
   you cant think about syria ( or many other countries in the region ) as a standard european-esque nation state . 
  we are talking about a clusterfuck of different tribes , religions , sects , nationalities . 
  european-esque nation states did n't pop into existence fully formed either , it took different groups agreeing to work together ( and a lot of fighting ) . 
   so where is that data ? 
  i could n't find a very good source in english , but there 's a bit of info in [ this article ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-31/here-s-how-the-refugee-crisis-may-reshape-sweden-s-social-model ) :  only about 25 percent of refugees that arrived over the past eight years now have a full time job . 
   no , we 're not . 
  those data include labor immigrants . 
  the employment statistics for refugee immigrants are much worse in comparison . 
   obviously , women do n't contribute anything to sweden / s. 
  the unemployment rate for native swedish women in your source is 4.2 % , lower than that of native men . 
  it 's like stating `` an increasing number of old people is making our country stronger '' . 
  although many old people do work and contribute in other ways to society , it does n't change the fact that an elderly person is currently a burden , on average . 
  they * might * make the country stronger if we found better ways for them to contribute , but that 's not the case now . 
  the survey premise did n't include that crucial `` might '' . 
  right , there might be valid reasons to move out , but in any case the [ results ] ( https://medarbetare.lnu.se/polopoly_fs/1.113520!emma%20neuman%20paper%201-4.pdf ) should give some cause for introspection . 
  if there 's reason to be concerned about immigration on the level of neighborhoods , maybe the less educated natives are not wrong to be concerned about immigration on the country level ? 
  and if the concerns are not valid , why are the highly educated natives so quick to bail out of these neighborhoods , when they should be the least prejudiced according to surveys ? 
  do you think that a neighborhood turns unsafe as soon as a few percent of inhabitants are immigrants ? 
  not quite what you 're asking , but watch what they do as well as what they say . 
  if the educated middle class folks tend to pack up and leave as soon as the proportion of non-european immigrants in a neighborhood gets above a few percent ( as researchers found in sweden ) , how much do they really love diversity ? 
  same could be said about multiculturalism . 
  in fact , multiculturalism has been criticised on [ much the same basis as nationalism ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/failure-multiculturalism ) - it tends to shoehorn people into a collective homogeneous identity , when the reality is much more complicated .
