  yep , felt like our most significant cultural contribution to the world was already kind of a given to include in any list . 
  though the [ alternative version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a247r3mns5a ) probably could be added .

  obviously there 's been a huge mess up with the . jpg compression rate . 
  boy , i hope someone got fired for that blunder . 
  there was this long ass story about the finnish jihadists who joined isis in the monthly edition of helsingin sanomat ( biggest newspaper in finland ) . 
  http://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/a1412301611311 spoiler alert , later on in the story one of them gets shot in the head and goes into a coma and what 's the logical next step ? 
  his friends want to organize a transport for him back to finland so he could get treated in a finnish hospital so they call their mother back in finland and try to arrange a way to get him into turkey and onwards from there but sadly ( not really ) he dies four days later to his wounds . 
  i mean what the fuck is going through these peoples minds . 
  words can not express how ridiculous this sounds like . 
  volleyball and basketball have gained quite a lot of fans over here lately as the men 's teams have gotten some decent results . 
  i think this was the first time in 32 years or something where finland got to the world championships . 
  there was about 5000 finnish volleyball fans in poland during the event . 
  right , reads straight in the article too . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  it 's not like people just snap one day from their usual behaviour and find themselves on planes heading to turkey or wherever they can cross the border to syria to fight for islam . 
  their parents usually seem to be very aware and worried about the drastic change in their offspring and maybe it would be good to enforce that they can seek help before their sons indeed really are in that plane and out of the country . 
  sure , it did factor into it . 
  :p i do like to practise my english whenever possible to keep it from rusting . 
  translation ( 'cause i 'm bored at work atm ) :  - fish , chicken , vegetables and fruits are starting to get pretty finito , says a finnish man spending his vacation in st. petersburg . 
   pictures are from a market residing near moskovskaja street right at the centrum of the city . 
  same phenomenon could also be seen at okei chain 's stores . 
   - people seem to be buying quite hefty amounts of fruit and stuff . 
  you ca n't really talk about a panic , but people have started buying them for storage . 
   according to the tuusula man 's russian friends the state has assured that prices wo n't rise and goods will be available . 
  for him it seems like the reality is of another kind . 
   - i understood that meat is expensive and is n't a part of an average russian 's diet . 
  not like chicken and fish which people consume as they are cheaper . 
  the sanctions will surely hit the poorest part of the people hardest , the man suspects . 
  the article says these breakers would go to the sakhalin oil and gas fields in the sea of okhotsk region ( north of japan ) . 
  there 's not too much out of ordinary in this order , this shipyard has already built several similar ships for this company and the russian traffic administration starting from 2010 . 
  the company is partly owned by the russian company united shipbuilding corporation but icebreakers are not currently included in the list of sanctioned items . 
  heh , `` more common '' . 
  that 's the mercedes-benz cls 350 cdi donated by tekniikan maailma ( a very popular technology magazine in finland ) to celebrate their 60th birthday which of course makes it a unique piece in the police fleet . 
  i did n't blame anything on anything . 
  i merely pointed out that the low average age is a result from their high birth rates and not from israel killing all old people from there as it seems to be implied here . 
  one could . 
  or then it 's because they have an extremely high birth rate which keeps pushing the average age down . 
  national land survey of finland maintains a property registry here . 
  they have a map service where you can search addresses from the map and it will show you the property identification number for you . 
  you can check it out [ here ] ( http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/en/real-property/registers-and-extracts/real-property-unit-identification-number ) . 
  ownership records are public information but i do n't think you can look them up online , you have to contact your nearest magistrate or similar public service and they will tell you them for the property id number . 
  you can also get a copy on paper with the information but it will of course cost something . 
  in the crash in finland the plane apparently got into a serious spiral and it 's likely that the strong g-forces involved pinned everyone against the plane 's walls and prevented them from moving . 
  according to the survivors , the plane was flying at an altitude of 4 kilometers when it lost its maneuvaribility and took a sudden nose dive so they would have had plenty of time to get out unless there were some very serious problems . 
  in this case it was a [ light kit plane ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comp_air_8 ) , which got a building permit in 2005 and a flight permit in 2009 so it was quite new . 
  a test pilot who had flown the plane in 2009 stated that it was a very good plane to fly . 
  the official crash investigation has n't yet completed but one theory is that someone 's parachute accidentally opened inside the plane and got caught on the plane 's tail . 
  damn , the same happened in finland too just over a month ago , 8 sky-divers dead and 3 managed to escape the plane and survived . 
  [ another article . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/secret_services_cyber_spies_twice_penetrated_foreign_ministry/7334589 ) gee , i really wonder where it came from . 
  nah , why bother , we already have facebook . 
  yes , finland has mandatory conscription . 
  the writer is a finn whose mother is an estonian who lived there under the soviet occupation . 
  she has researched the subject of baltic occupation quite extensively and has written few fictional books which converse on the matter but she probably is n't the average voice of baltic people . 
  not that i know what people are thinking about the whole situation over there either but thought it should be brought up . 
  yes i too have no idea why everyone , including the tatars , are so salty about just a little bit of annexing parts of another sovereign country . 
  it 's like everyone 's trying to make russia the bad guy here for some good old fashioned conquering even though they 'd go even as far as changing names for a few rivers in exchange for their land . 
  sheesh , some people ... 
  the problem did n't originate from belarus . 
  http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/contents/asf-heatmap.jpg looking at that map one might say that banning the meat from the entirety of europe where the disease apparently has been largely eradicated a long time ago could be a slight overkill . 
  damn those slightly historically inaccurate candies , ruining everyones lives . 
  i 'm sure glad they dealt with that one . 
  that still leaves the african tribal mask and the tiki mask , i thought those looked pretty accurate . 
  i hope they 're not offending the africans and the maoris by excluding their cultural heritage . 
  the japanese have used all kinds of masks in their theatrical plays and holiday celebrations etc. 
  for a very long time . 
  they also charged [ jussi halla-aho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jussi_halla-aho ) for ethnic agitation and breach of the sanctity of religion and convicted him for the latter to a small fine in 2009 . 
  the whole thing was pretty absurd and raised some discussion about the freedom of speech in finland . 
  the old list on wikipedia that is usually linked around has the consumption based on the weight of the coffee itself and not cups . 
  would be interesting to see some updated data on it . 
  pretty sure it 's about reading comprehension . 
  quickly googled example :  the railroad was not the first institution to impose regularity on society , or to draw attention to the importance of precise timekeeping . 
  for as long as merchants have set out their wares at daybreak and communal festivities have been celebrated , people have been in rough agreement with their neighbors as to the time of day . 
  the value of this tradition is today more apparent than ever . 
  were it not for public acceptance of a single yardstick of time , social life would be unbearably chaotic : the massive daily transfers of goods , services , and information would proceed in fits and starts ; the very fabric of modern society would begin to unravel . 
  what is the main idea of the passage ? 
  * a ) in modern society we must make more time for our neighbors . 
  * b ) the traditions of society are timeless . 
  * c ) an accepted way of measuring time is essential for the smooth functioning of society . 
  * d ) society judges people by the times at which they conduct certain activities . 
  some people have trouble at this . 
  finland and the netherlands already do n't have 1c and 2c coins in circulation and use the rounding up method . 
  i think on a collective level europe has still managed this . 
  they 're still legal tender by the way so you can pay with them , they 're just hard to find over here . 
  i see you got the centurion package from the ad agency . 
  russian yandex is also building a very large data center in m\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 , finland . 
  i think facebook has one in sweden already . 
  not what i said . 
  the people who do the begging at the street corners and the people who do the burglaries are not the same . 
  if begging is banned and enforced against , it might not make too much sense anymore to bring grandma along and make her sit on the cold street with a paper cup while the men go break into homes . 
  the latter part is already going on and will continue afterwards but it might alleviate the begging problem . 
  there 's a new dropbox type of thingie coming from f-secure called [ younited ] ( http://www.younited.com/ ) , though it 's still in alpha/beta testing phase . 
  synchronizes between android/ios/wp / windows/mac/html5 browsers and uses 256-bit aes for encryption . 
  [ relevant tv ad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njbbakwoeeq ) for the ice cream mentioned in the article . 
  reactions from a bunch of foreigners and then from a bunch of finns . 
  finland : [ the quantum thief ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_quantum_thief ) by hannu rajaniemi ( 2010 , sci-fi ) got quite good reviews . 
  planned to be a trilogy .
