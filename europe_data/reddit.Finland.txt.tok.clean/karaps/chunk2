  finland : [ dna ] ( https://kauppa.dna.fi/tuotteet/laajakaista/laajakaista/lkkx350m ) 350/20 mbit/s 59,90 $ [ sonera ] ( http://www.sonera.fi/nettiyhteydet/kotiin/laajakaista+kotiin/ ) 100/10 mbit/s ( on fiber or vdsl2 ) or 100/5 mbit/s ( on cable ) 29,90 $ ( 39,90 $ without a 24 month contract ) first one is the fastest available while the latter one is way more widely available . 
  also the latter price applies to slower 24/1 and 8/1 adsl2 + connections if faster ones are n't available . 
  weird that they did n't mention that one of the men killed was a swedish politician from the swedish left party , you 'd think that would be bigger news . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:finland_greater_arms_suggestion_1936_coloured.png ) a proposed version for the greater coat of arms for finland from 1936 . 
  never got adopted for use so there 's only the lesser coat of arms featuring the sword wielding lion on a shield . 
  you 're right , the article calls it erroneously `` aid '' even though they were simply loans from the very beginning to manage their current loan installments in exchange for implementing austerity measures . 
  over 2000 people were evacuated from their homes after a threatening situation arose in an explosives plant . 
  irc was created in finland so it 's been a pretty popular instant messaging platform among internet people for a long time . 
  there 's a site called [ irc-galleria ] ( http://irc-galleria.net/ ) which was originally created to host pictures of irc users so curious nerds could see what their channel buddies looked like . 
  eventually it grew as a social platform and got `` invaded '' by people who had no idea what irc was outside of the gallery site and it 's just an average social networking service now . 
  it still has 450000 registered users . 
  both irc and the gallery site have lost quite a bit of user base to facebook . 
  then there 's discussion forums . 
  [ suomi24 ] ( http://www.suomi24.fi/ ) is probably the largest one and it holds the vast majority of average people who just want to spew their incoherent ramblings to the internet . 
  then there 's [ murobbs ] ( http://murobbs.plaza.fi/ ) which is the forum for [ muropaketti ] ( http://muropaketti.com/ ) , a finnish computer hardware site that used to specialize in overclocking . 
  it 's pretty heavily moderated so the discussion is usually surprisingly intelligent and sober and there 's discussions for pretty much everything . 
  there 's tons of other smaller forums with more specialized content . 
  there 's also some chan culture , largest one currently is [ ylilauta ] ( http://ylilauta.org/ ) after some previous incarnations had been shut down for various reasons . 
  they are responsible for some memes like dolan which have spread further along . 
  slow people in traffic lights for example . 
  at least i 've gotten pretty mad at that ass who made me miss the green light even though i was third in line and you can usually push ten cars through the lights in one cycle . 
  not really a life threatening situation as i 'm not even moving . 
  does n't really happen in the grocery store line , grannies counting their pennies are pretty annoying but i still ignore them with only a deep sigh . 
  i know , `` hein\u00e4 '' means also hay so it 's not 100 % word for word accurate but it 's just a constructed joke which could probably be tailored to fit a little bit bitter . 
  a brit , a finn and a swede were sitting in a bar and at some point the topic moved to the beauty of each ones native languages . 
  the briton suggested that to solve the argument they should have a piece of poetry and read it out in their own languages . 
  the brit chose the piece which described his home country and started : `` o ' island , island , grassy island , grassy island 's maiden . '', 
  the finn continued : `` saari , saari , hein\u00e4saari , hein\u00e4saaren neito . '', 
  the swede thought for a moment and spoke : '' \u00d6 , \u00f6 , h\u00f6-\u00f6 , h\u00f6-\u00f6ns m\u00f6 . '', 
  top ten : * 1 . 
  australia * 2 . 
  sweden * 3 . 
  norway * 5 . 
  switzerland * 6 . 
  netherlands * 9 . 
  iceland * 10 . 
  united kingdom, 
  maybe but was n't this a map of energy consumed by capita regardless of where it comes from ? 
  water power would still show up in the figures so this is n't a map of how `` green '' a country is . 
  guess we just have a lot of power hungry industries for a population of just 5,5 million . 
  also think of all those electric saunas . 
  finland has a ton of heavy duty industry in paper and metal processing industries which draw enormous amounts of power . 
  cheap energy has been one of finland 's trump cards to attract / keep these industries to stay in the country . 
  yes , symbols incorporating swastikas have been used in the nordics from prehistoric times so they definitely were n't a new thing . 
  in finnish the old symbols are known as [ tursaansyd\u00e4n ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tursaansyd\u00e4n ) and people used them pretty much in similar ways that hinduism uses them , to protect from evil . 
  yeah might be , pretty sure i saw the pictures you 're talking about here in reddit at some point . 
  they opened the picture archives very recently , only about a month ago . 
  there 's some 160000 pictures from the war years available for viewing and some are indeed of quite graphic nature . 
  this one was actually drawn by some japanese guy . 
  the finnish embassy of tokyo is for some weird reason relatively popular over there and their twitter feed has over 95000 followers . 
  they held a little drawing competition last year for the age old concept that the finnish border lines can be imagined as a female figure and this was one of the entries . 
  i thought it was pretty nice . 
  how about [ maiden of finland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eu3uev6.jpg ) ? 
  why is n't there any repercussions ? 
  what are the age limits in sweden ? 
  here the criminal responsibility begins at 15 years of age but being under that does n't release you from paying for the damages ( for example small children playing with matches and burning a school can be ordered to pay huge reparations ) . 
  usually parents have to pick up these if they do n't want their children 's debt to run up interest until they are 18 and it begins to be reduced from their income . 
  money is always a great motivator . 
  apparently belgium 's low score is due to flood waters entering the rivers etc. 
  same with the netherlands and the uk . 
  true , though the tone of skin is definitely a factor in the indian society when it comes to the perception of beauty and status . 
  skin whitening products are currently in a huge boom over there ( at least according to some web articles ) . 
  how nice of you to accuse him for a straw man when your own argument is a giant straw man of its own . 
  nobody said anything about killing anyone either . 
  finland : major spring flooding in the osthrobothnia region due to rivers getting blocked by ice dams , water getting everywhere and people have even been evacuated . 
  it 's easing up already though . 
  finnish air force has grounded almost all of its f/a -18 hornet fighters after finding out that the explosive packs on the pilots seat ejectors are faulty . 
  they need to get new ones from the u.s. sm-liiga , the premier ice hockey league of finland having its championship series going on between tampere tappara and pori \u00c4ss\u00e4t . 
  \u00c4ss\u00e4t are currently leading the series 3-2 . 
  cities and towns are not of any concern in plans like these because large operators have commercial interests in those areas anyways which means that they have been and will be upgrading their networks to support faster connections in order to stay ahead or with the competition . 
  there 's plenty of 100mbps connections available right now in larger cities and even the coveted 1gbps connections have been in pilot phase for quite a while . 
  it 's the small towns and rural areas where things need a bit pushing from behind to make it happen and setting a very small slice of the eu budget cake aside s a good way to do it . 
  well , just trying to do my part here , sir . 
  black , no sugar . 
  4 - 6 cups a day . 
  english | finnish | translated | : -- | : -- | : -- the bourne identity | medusan verkko | medusa 's net the bourne supremacy | medusan isku | medusa 's strike the bourne ultimatum | medusan sinetti | medusa 's seal the bourne legacy | medusan perint\u00f6 | medusa 's legacy, 
  you might enjoy somby then , it 's a finnish saami rock band and they sing exclusively in northern saami and i agree that it really is a fascinating and beautiful language . 
  true and the reason why the parent company stx corporation `` shopped around '' for these government loans in the first place is rumored to be that it has severe financial troubles and can not find loan money from the open market . 
  some of the traditions for finland include : * visiting the graveyards to pay your respects to your loved ones who have passed away and decorating the graves with candles and spruce sprigs . 
  * visiting the christmas church ( which is the only time of the year when most people visit the church anyways and this tradition is somewhat losing popularity ) . 
  * due to the prevalence of saunas , the christmas sauna is a part of the tradition but we heat up the saunas several times per week anyways so not that special , maybe just a little bit more thorough bathing session . 
  christmas presents are usually given after the sauna though . 
  * the snowman and jiminy cricket 's christmas greeting are the staples on tv during the christmas . 
  foods included in the christmas table : * christmas ham , served as-is with mustard or on top of rye bread or [ karelian pasties ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/karjalanpiirakka-20060227.jpg ) . 
  * [ karelian stew ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xg_ibumlihe/tvfo6sgmr5i/aaaaaaaaamo/xdsjcqds4_8/s1600/karjalanpaisti.jpg ) with boiled potatoes * several different kinds of casseroles * lutefisk * pickled herring * salad thingie called [ rosolli ] ( http://static.kotikokki.net/public_files/recipeimages/0/28/263/large.jpg?1297445450 ) overall it 's a pretty standard nordic christmas experience . 
  actually the groke represents the loneliness and sadness in people . 
  there 's a personification of winter in the moomin world also , she 's called the [ lady of the cold ] ( http://moomin.wikia.com/wiki/the_lady_of_the_cold ) who is supposed to be beautiful like a winter landscape but also as deadly if you get caught in it without shelter . 
  she also has a bad ass [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zutime_9s4u ) of her own . 
  there 's a gigantic difference when you cross the border between finland and russia though . 
  yeah turns out pouring shit tons of money and work hours into perfecting user interfaces actually produces results . 
  i also appreciate gimp for being a free alternative but holy shit it is frustrating when you actually have to do some work on it instead of adobe photoshop . 
  it 's the human smugglers who create these mental images to drum up their sales . 
  they have facebook pages advertising safe passage to europe with pictures of luxurious yachts and they make sumptuous promises about life when they reach germany or sweden . 
  in reality they arrive to the shore and there 's a rickety dinghy packed full of people and you 've already paid the smugglers so are you coming in or not so in they go . 
  then the life is n't necessarily that great in the refugee reception center , that is if they do n't drown in the mediterranean first . 
  forest industry is not doing too badly if you look at the numbers and statistics but closures of large factories are always painful and give a good boost to the unemployment statistics . 
  there simply has been an oversupply of paper in the global market and paper mills have been closed through europe and finland was no exception to that either . 
  on the other hand there has also been some new investments in the industry , the largest being a bioproduct mill worth 1,1 billion euros . 
  well , about two weeks ago russian customs stopped a gentleman trying to smuggle 63 kg of various finnish food items over the border which would fit the painting better . 
  that 's clearly a brown bear , our national animal .
