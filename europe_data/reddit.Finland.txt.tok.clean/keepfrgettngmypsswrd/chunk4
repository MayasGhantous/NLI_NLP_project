  i think it 's because they do n't live that high up in the north ... and generally have everything easier than we do in here in the cold dark gloomy finland . 
  ~ ~ ... or the danish ones , there 's some very very very attractive danish girls around there , somewhere . 
  i 've seen them , they exist !, 
  it 's not just a fantasy , i 'm sure . ~ ~ personally i have somewhat of a fantasy of denmark being a land of beautiful women . 
  now since i 've only seen some pictures of danish women , which has led me to fantasize denmark as a land of beautiful women , i ca n't be completely sure myself if this is just a fantasy of mine . 
  also , i have absolutely no idea where exactly those beautiful danish women reside , except somewhere in denmark , and i can not be absolutely certain that anyone else has seen pictures of beautiful danish women or knows of their whereabouts , i have to only comfort myself with the fact that as a man in control of his faculties i can be certain of myself and my belief that there are beautiful women in denmark and that there are so many beautiful women in there , that for me personally denmark is a land of beautiful women even if i could never verify my beliefs to have an absolute certainty . 
  but yeah , the americans probably do want them swedish girls . 
  ** edit : ** and yeah , i really do sincerely mean that i 've seen some very attractive danish girls . 
  it is true . 
  i 'm finnish , hey , we do n't even have the basic idea of how sarcasm works , have some credit . 
  ** edit2 : ** just to be really super sure to be on the safe side , rephrased the original message ** edit3 : ** ok now i 'm just confused . 
  am i not in the right in saying that there are beautiful women in denmark ? 
  good god !, 
  you do n't talk to the driver !, 
  not ever !, 
  he 's * busy driving * !, 
  a\u0144d our grannies are * busy riding the bus * . 
  that monster !, 
  both have very good advantages in deterring any invaders if employed the right way.there 's nothing quite as frightening as an inter-continental ballistic swedish b\u00f6g . 
  what happened was that they needed about that much territory to bury their dead . 
  they won a massive graveyard . 
  so hooray , i guess ? 
   finland is still mostly forest and lakes . 
  and bogs , do n't forget the bogs . 
  40 % of the country is pretty much more or less boggy ... good luck with them tanks on swampland ... 
  not denying that . 
  the important word here is ** ` originated ' ** , people seem to be missing that completely , but that 's ok . edit : [ vikings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikings ) , on wikipedia just check it out, 
  yea , there 's a lot more that could be covered in finland 's history lessons on estonia , a lot that was n't talked about or written down too well , or even erased exactly because of the soviets . 
  eh , give or take , i 'd say northern estonians raided vikings , same as finns , pretty much everyone around the baltic sea raided each other one time or another , by boats , and had a culture with similar elements . 
  does n't make them ( or us ) vikings . 
  however , there is a good chance that vikings established a trading post and permanent residence in northern estonia . 
  i 'm not contesting this at all . 
  well yeah , that explains it . 
  i wondered if the reason might be soviets , but since our general history does n't even cover swedish empire that well let alone where they occupied . 
  historically a swedish minority in estonia does make a lot of sense . 
  hm , i do n't know to what extent estonians might consider themselves as nordic , but here 's a handy and memorable rule concerning the whole nordic-or-scandinavian - thing : ** scandinavians are people belonging to the countries in which you find the areas from where the vikings originated . 
  ** finland ? 
  out . 
  estonia ? 
  sorry , no . 
  iceland ? 
  out . 
  definitely not . 
  norway ? 
  most definitely . 
  yes . 
  sweden ? 
  damn right . 
  ** nordic countries , however , are the countries that have the most direct descendants of the vikings culturally , linguistically and genetically . 
  ** and so because we have a relatively large swedish population here in finland , cultural influences from sweden since the middle ages and quite a few family lines mixing up between sweden and finland , you can count us in . 
  estonia ? 
  not so much , estonia had an important trading hub in tallinn as a part of the hanseatic league , and northern estonia was incorporated into the swedish empire in the 16th century , ~ ~ but for one reason or another it seems that a major swedish speaking population never settled in that well in estonia . ~ ~ ... or to be more precise , swedish influences on estonian culture was erased almost completely under the oppression of the soviet union . 
  also as a rule of thumb you could say that the major difference between baltic countries and nordic countries is in which empire 's sphere of influence the countries and their population has belonged longer . 
  swedish empire ? 
  that 's nordic countries . 
  russian empire ? 
  that 's the baltic countries . 
  you might also want to note that speeding tickets are not scaled in sweden . 
  the crime has to be more severe . 
  causing an accident will give you fines scaled on income , speeding does n't . 
  i 'm not quite sure how it goes in other nordic countries , or austria , or switzerland , but i 'd expect that if they had our system , there already would have been news about these massive fines from those countries . 
  our rich people endangering traffic this way is a relatively new phenomenon . 
  it used to be amusement for the middle class and the poor ( that 's why we have relatively many rally and f1 drivers ) . 
  ok , the rubber cop , is not a finnish rubber cop . 
  our rubber cops wear a darker blue . 
  finland still not part of scandinavia . 
  we are however , part of the [ nordic countries ] ( http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers ) believe it or not , there 's a difference . 
  speeding tickets in sweden are n't scaled based on income , causing a traffic accident is . 
  police in picture not wearing a finnish police uniform , not a finnish officer . 
  of course they 're not going to listen to it , most of them have already buggered off to syria out of reach of yle broadcasts . 
  the program is hardly meant for the 10 000 or so people here in finland who have arabic as their native language , but i wonder if they would appreciate if parts of the text would actually be read in arabic . 
  ... i do n't know ... there 's a lot of different kinds of societies a finn might find acceptable to live in ... half of the time we live in the woods in the middle of nowhere , with no running water , kill bears with our bare hands and eat raw fish . 
  and the bear . 
  and some random moose we just punched . 
  raw . 
  edit : o yea , and we use moss as toilet paper , just trust me on this , i 'm a finn , we have no sense of humor . 
  it 's read from front to back . 
  ( * edit : i mean from cover to cover ... * ) but i 'd expand your point with asking how does reading any holy book really improve the knowledge of any religion ? 
  how much does any religion as a modern-day institution correspond with the contents of a holy book ? 
   although there 's continuous `` general tension '' due to historical reasons and fear of russian attack plays central role in the identity-formation of finnish people and political imagination/rhetorics as well good that you pointed this out . 
  it 's one of those things that seems almost inconceivable for a lot of people , our dynamic with russia . 
  yes , we 're a neighboring country , yes we 've always had good relations with russia , but no , we were not an u.s.s.r. satellite state unless you define that very loosely and no , we 've never quite been in the russian sphere of influence . 
  not quite . 
  there 's still a lot of historical baggage and racial tensions going on , and this is something that you do n't really see from looking at the maps . 
  just recently stratfor publicized a study stating that karelia would appeal joining back to finland , for instance . 
  what in essence is left out is the racial tensions that a lot of people have towards russia and russians here in finland . 
  i 'd love it if this was n't the case , but they know in russia just as well as we do in here that we are n't slavs , we 're not russian , not quite enough and it only makes sense in the historical context . 
  one would do well to keep in mind that fennougric people were systematically persecuted in stalin 's russia , forced to migrate from their homes within russia and thrown into gulags . 
  so despite having good relations with russia , deploying keen diplomatic skills with them and even benefiting from cooperation , it might be safe to say considering the mutual uneasy history that we do n't really want to march by their tune that much at all , diplomatically speaking . 
  i do n't know about the rest , but karelia rejoining finland is not going to happen , not likely to ever happen at all and absolutely impossible in the next decade . 
  people in karelia these days have deeper cultural ties to st. petersburg than finland , and nobody in their right mind in finland wants the worthless territory of a toxic waste dump of a 3rd world country rejoined . 
  unless , well , russian federation pays us to take it out of their hands . 
  which is n't happening , not now , not ever . 
  well for one i 'm not surprised if estonians have a strong dislike towards a certain specific other nation . 
  just look at their history . 
  should also be noted that this news and statistic it 's based on is about * crimes reported * to the police . 
  as in crime reports filed . 
  the number of crime reports filed where the suspected perpetrator is not originally of finnish descent has gone up by 179 % . 
  there have been legislative changes and changes in the statistics gathering practices : last year sexual harassment became a criminal offence in itself , as a distinct reportable and punishable crime . 
  it is to be expected that by this fact alone there will be more of this kind of crime to be reported .
