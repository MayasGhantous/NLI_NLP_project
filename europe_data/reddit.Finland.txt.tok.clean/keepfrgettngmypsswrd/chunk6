  or will be soon enough . 
  well , it is a net positive for the political parties who manage to cash in on the xenophobia . 
  edit : uh , what with this post being downvoted i have to ask : since when getting votes has not been a positive thing for a political party ? 
  like ... is someone thinking that xenophobic right-wing parties are really pissed off about people voting for them ? 
  it 's widely recognized in finland that conscription is a burden for the economy , and there are studies every few years to check if there would be any other options available which would still maintain the current level of defense without incurring extra costs . 
  so far the studies have concluded that there are n't . 
  and yea , thanks for the support  fiskars tools are the shit , best goddamn axes and scissors in the world . 
  what are the necessary requirements for a stable income , job and a house in finland ? 
  you see no problem in raising the primiparity age ? 
  so you would say that only those parent who do not have children out of their own volition or because they are not capable should not be exempt from military service ? 
  and this is n't problematic from the perspective of gender equality or maintaining the current level of defense ? 
  according to a study in 2010 , only 16 % of people of age would volunteer to join armed forces if finland would have a career army . 
  a survey in 2014 found that only 11 % of the finnish population wish to abolish conscription . 
  how exactly would a career army improve finnish defense capabilities without bearing excess economic costs or affecting adversely with population structure in the generations to come ? 
  because you guess ? 
  you do n't think it would ? 
  what are the reasons for average age at primiparity in finland being 28,6 years and age of all parturients 30,4 years ? 
  how exactly would temporary exemption from service correct this ? 
  one option would be full exemption from service if a woman has borne children , but would that be considered to fulfill gender equality ? 
  should n't all fathers then also be exempt from military service completely ? 
  what would be the consequences of exempting all parents from military service ? 
  would the armed forces have less , or more soldiers in the standing army ? 
  nah man , it 's not mra propaganda . 
  if it were mra propaganda , you 'd think they 'd have more beef with the country next-door to the east having male-only conscription . 
  yet somehow rather conveniently that other country having conscription is never the problem , but finland having male-only conscription always is . 
  and for some reason this question comes frequently up every time there is a violation of finnish airspace by planes from the country to the east , or some other nonsense of eastern major military power saber-rattling . 
  strange coincidences , not that they 're related , but strangest of coincidences . 
  no such law because that would never even get into voting rounds in the parliament . 
  question is , how much would a compulsory military service lessen the female populations incentive and capability of bearing children . 
  would the effect be positive or negative ? 
  what would be the economic repercussions if any ? 
  positive or negative ? 
  what do you think ? 
  finland does n't claim to be among world 's best in equality . 
  it 's based on international studies . 
  there is no-one stopping from creating well-drafted suggestions which take into account maintaining the current level of finnish defense capabilities , the cost on the local economy of having a significant percentage of the workforce not working , and declining population numbers and birth-rate . 
  at least those should be covered one way or another . 
  unfortunately this is unsustainable for the national economy of finland . 
  you are completely free to invest in finland 's economy to make equal conscription more of a possibility . 
  if anything you said is to be taken as true , then how on earth do you explain germany regaining its population after ww2 ? 
  also i would very much appreciate your burden of proof on humans being monogamous species . 
  * scientific proof * . 
  the gdp percentages ? 
  keller , k. , poutvaara , p. and wagener , a. 
  ( 2006 ) : '' military draft and economic growth in oecd countries '' might be worth looking into although i based it on what [ poutvaara has stated in an interview 2010 ( in finnish ) ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/tutkija_asevelvollisuus_tulee_suomelle_kalliiksi/5513799 ) . 
  poutvaara himself wants to abolish conscription and replace it with a career army . 
  oh of course , i must be mistaken in assuming that conscripted soldiers would ever be used in any invasion . 
  ever . 
  finland is a country which as a nation is always prepared for the worst possible scenarios . 
  more or less . 
  ensuring that the population as a whole has enough capabilities to protect themselves and others , even if mandating it by law , is a far cry from slavery . 
  might as well argue that wearing seat belts is slavery . 
  all finnish women who are willing can join the army , nothing 's stopping them . 
  men who have absolutely no willingness to protect those who can not protect themselves , serve their country and their fellow citizens are not required to join the army , there are other options . 
  who 's going to pay for that ? 
  or should defense capabilities be reduced by taking in 50 % less men so that 50 % of women could perform non-military service ? 
  you 'd have to reserve 3-4 % extra from the gdp into having all capable women to have a non-military or military service for 6 months to a year , doubling the defense budget and the hidden costs of the people of age not paying taxes for that time , into around 8 % of the gdp in total . 
  not happening any time soon . 
  consider never . 
  must be a luxury to care so little of those who ca n't fend for themselves . 
  you go right ahead and keep you and yours and gtfo . 
  be safe . 
  fair enough , finnish defence forces becomes more or less redundant when russia abolishes its armed forces altogether . 
  otherwise it 's a bit of a no-go . 
  tragedy of the commons is a difficult nut to crack when it comes to nations of small declining populations in interesting geopolitical locations . 
  currently any consideration of finland joining nato does not make conscription a redundancy . 
  having a standing professional army of soldiers who get paid decent wages the size of the current armed forces is not an available option because of budgetary restrictions . 
  perhaps you would like to invest in finland to pave the way for finland to end conscription and have a hired army instead ? 
  eh , it 's not for the country , it 's for your fellow human beings and to protect your home . 
  yea , read further than the first sentence , it gets a little more detailed . 
  might be ass-backwards , from abolishing altogether to having more women and less men ... but eh , when it comes to the whole debate it usually tends to revolve around the 50/50 split as well as how the world would be so much better if there were no conscription at all . 
  abolishing conscription in finland is reasonable ** if and only if russia would greatly reduce its military capability ** and on their part abolish conscription as well . 
  ** necessity ** and idealism seldom make a perfect match , reality requires compromises . 
  ukraine abolished conscription in 2013 , crimea was invaded shortly few months after in 2014 . 
  conscription was reinstated in ukraine later in 2014 . 
  russia limited their military operations considerably in ukraine after that . 
  other factors were at play , this is not to be denied , the operational capabilities of ukraine 's standing army should still be perfectly clear part of the considerations . 
  ** budgetary restrictions ** limit the size of the finnish peace-time standing army , risking defense capabilities on labor market fluctuations in a country the size and geopolitical location of finland is not rational . 
  ** heavy losses in manpower is to be expected . 
  ** in ww2 finland lost around 3 % of the population , predominantly male combatants . 
  population size recovered shortly after the war . 
  in any subsequent and modern time war heavier losses should be expected . 
  population of 5 million can recover within a generation even if 20 % ( or more , as presented in [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/244oc4/how_much_percentage_of_the_german_male_population/ch3q91a ) ? ), 
  of male population is eradicated by the enemy , but the loss of even 10 % of the female population is absolutely catastrophic . 
  ** if finnish male-only conscription is a problem , this is easily fixed : ** 1 . 
  be a female , preferably under 28 . 
  become a finnish citizen . 
  join the finnish defence forces . 
  outperform at least 70 % of the male soldiers in your company . 
  bring your friends with , and their friends , and have all of you and your female children as well join the army and outperform at least 70 % of the male soldiers . 
  problem solved , in a generation or two as long as acted along the lines of numbers 1 to 5 . 
  peak performances , laws of average , limited population size and difficult terrain . 
  there are women who can be better combatants than the worst male soldiers . 
  but when it comes to finland , there are n't enough . 
  on an average male population outperforms physically the female population , and with the current military doctrine of finnish defence forces physical fitness is of paramount importance . 
  the main peace-time function of finnish defence forces and conscription is to have a standing army with ongoing training program in place all the time with sufficient combat capabilities as a first response and to make any considerations of an invasion less appealing . 
  shortly , it 's a deterrent , and it buys time . 
  - if you want peace , prepare for war . 
  finnish defence forces and the government of finland will most likely consider conscription and military training to include female citizens if and when finland will be under similar ongoing geopolitical conflict as israel . 
  so not to be expected any time soon if all other things are equal .
