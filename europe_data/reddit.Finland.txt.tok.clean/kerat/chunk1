because `` condemning israel '' for what ? 
  for daring to stand up to a terrorist organization that is hamas ? 
  then lets all condemn usa for their war on al-qaeda or france for their campaign in mali i 'm so amused when clueless people are so opinionated . 
  how about condemning israel for violating multiple un resolutions and for the war crime of collective punishment over its illegal blockade of gaza ? 
  or for its 60 year long occupation of palestinian territory ? 
  or for the apartheid wall that it is building on occupied territory ? 
  or for the fact that it routinely murders palestinians in the west bank , which is n't , by the way , run by hamas . 
  the pa renounced violence a long time ago , and yet settlement building continues and palestinians are shot by the idf at a rate of nearly one per week . 
  no you 're a shill because you deny the incredibly obvious fact that israel is an apartheid state , and try to ignore the history and avoid talking about it because you know as well as i do how incriminating it is . 
  and you do n't get to rule automatically despite winning a fair election ?? 
  hahahaha my god man this discussion has reached a new low . 
  how can you type while bent completely backwards trying to defend the pa and israel ? 
  the pa refuses to step down and starts a civil war to stay in power and * even that * you 're not willing to condemn ??? 
  i 've wasted enough time on this conversation . 
  good day, 
   i do n't even understand why we are talking about the occupation . 
  uhhhh ... because it is a 60 year occupation . 
  israeli shills love to pretend that each bout of violence is a one-time thing . 
  that 's why they hate to bring up the history . 
   so it would be the fatah , who is the actual legitimate powerholder of the palistianian authority not true . 
  hamas won the democratic elections in 2005 that were monitored by international organizations and declared fair . 
  the pa refused to give up authority and sparked a civil war to keep power . 
   btw , egypt has everything to do with the blockade no it has nothing to do with it other than being a tool for you to obfuscate the issue and try to lay the blame elsewhere other than israel . 
  since the embargo is illegal then egypt is also breaking international law . 
  we are talking about israel now , which claims to defend itself whilst occupying another country , which as i 've already shown , is completely ridiculous and illogical . 
   kinda like hamas attacked israeli soil , where they broke a signed cease fire , making the response legal . 
  hahahah prove it . 
  hamas states that the ceasefire was broken by israel when it killed anwar qdeih . 
  israel killed him and shot 10 others within 2 days of the ceasefire , and they were not firing rockets or taking part in hostilities . 
  israel then killed a young civilian on a motorcycle for no reason 9 days after the agreement . 
  hamas at that point had already declared that israel violated the agreement . 
  which for all intents and purposes : it did . 
  and it does n't matter anyway since israel is an apartheid state that occupies another state for 60 years and pretends to be `` defending '' itself on someone else 's soil . 
  amazing , you make a strawman and then do n't address most of my comment . 
   because the settlements are illegal , which they are , and totally indefencable , does not make the occupation itself illegal . 
  and where exactly did i make that argument ? 
  i clearly referenced international law . 
  your response : international law is tricky and vague the law clearly states that either israel is in an armed conflict iac with gaza , making it an illegal occupying power violating the geneva conventions - * and the rockets fired from gaza legal * . 
  or it is not in an armed conflict , in which case the blockade of gaza is illegal and a war crime . 
  and that does n't really even matter because it is very obviously collective punishment according to the geneva conventions that israel has ratified and according to the un fact-finding report that called it an illegal blockade and a war crime . 
  you amazingly did n't address any of these points and just barged on forward making erroneous arguments about egypt which have nothing to do with the legality of israel 's blockade . 
  secondly , you keep making erroneous comments about the palmer report . 
  according to both amnesty and [ the israeli centre gisha , the legal centre for freedom of movement , ] ( http://gisha.org/en-blog/2011/09/07/myths-and-facts-on-the-palmer-report/ ) the palmer report did not actually say the blockade was legal - just the * naval * blockade of gaza . 
  not the blockade by land or air . 
  `` the legality of the overall closure policy was left as an open question by the panel '' . 
   it is legitimate for israel to fight back hamas where they have control , just like it was equally legitimate for nato to fight back the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan even though they are non state orginisations . 
  they are n't privileged combatants either . 
  it 's legitimate to fight `` back '' against a place that you occupy ? 
  amazing feat of logic !, 
  and nato was not occupying the taleban or al-qaeda . 
  they attacked us soil and started the war . 
  israel was occupying palestinian land decades before hamas ever existed . 
  and lastly - israel is still in violation of un resolution 1860 which calls for the `` unimpeded '' provision of fuel and food and medicine to gaza . 
  something that was never implemented . 
  also , it 's nice to see that my view is in perfect accordance with dr. ben saul of the national lawyers guild , who [ wrote that ] ( http://www.nlginternational.org/news/article.php?nid=313 ) the flotilla raid was illegal because the blockade was also illegal . 
  the `` inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war '' is exactly what israel did . 
  it acquired territory by war . 
  and resolution 242 defined a ceasefire line known as the '67 borders , in contrast with the borders stipulated in resolution 181 that israel is also violating . 
  so how did israel `` adopt '' the resolution when it has been in complete violation of it from the start ? 
  and why are those borders still the ones that the international community recognizes israel in ? 
  as for the blockade , secretary general ban ki moon condemned the blockade at the time , and the goldstone report suggested it was a war crime . 
  the 1909 declaration concerning the laws of naval war ( the london declaration ) , also makes it clear that blockades are an acceptable form of warfare , when * two belligerent nations are at war . 
  * the problem with this , is that these measures make acceptable blockades amongst ** nations at war . 
  ** they specifically state that nations must be in international armed conflict ( iac ) . 
  the reason this creates complexity in the matter , is because israel 's official position is that they are ** not in armed conflict with the palestinians ** , nor with gaza specifically . 
  the reason they do not want to be in armed conflict , is because that would mean they have to abide by the geneva conventions . 
  kevin john heller of [ opiniojuris ] ( http://opiniojuris.org/2010/06/02/why-is-israels-blockade-of-gaza-legal/ ) says it well :  if the `` cost '' of the blockade is formally recognizing hamas as a belligerent , maintaining the blockade would mean recognizing hamas fighters as privileged combatants . 
  ( just as the armed forces of any state are privileged combatants . ), 
  that would be fundamentally unacceptable to israel , because hamas fighters would then be entitled to attack israeli combatants and would have to be treated as pows upon capture . 
  craig murray , former british ambassador , and an honorary research fellow at the university of lancaster school of law , and ** head of the foreign office maritime section ** [ also puts it well  ( http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2010/06/why_san_remo_do/ )  israeli apologists have gone on to say they are in a state of armed conflict with gaza . 
    really ? 
  in that case , why do we continually hear israeli complaints about rockets fired from gaza into israel ? 
  if it is the formal israeli position that it is in a state of armed conflict with gaza , then gaza has every right to attack israel with rockets . 
    but in fact , plainly to the whole world , the nature and frequency of israeli complaints about rocket attacks gives evidence that israel does not in fact believe that a situation of armed conflict exists . 
    secondly , if israel wishes to claim it is in a state of armed conflict with gaza , then it must treat all of its gazan prisoners as prisoners of war entitled to the protections of the geneva convention . 
  ** if you are in a formal state of armed conflict , you can not categorise your opponents as terrorists . 
  ** so either israel is in armed conflict , and thus an illegal occupying power violating human rights as well as the geneva convention . 
  or israel is not in armed conflict , as they claim , making the blockade illegal . 
  * but the blockade is probably illegal anyway * even if that little conundrum does n't convince you that the blockade is illegal , there is the little problem of human rights . 
  first of all , the san remo manual also states in paragraph 102 that it is illegal to apply a blockade on an entire population , according to craig murrey , and [ according to dr. ben saul . 
  ] ( http://www.nlginternational.org/news/article.php?nid=313 ) secondly , collective punishment is illegal according to article 33 of the geneva convention -- * which israel has ratified . 
  * so is it collective punishment ? 
  a fact-finding mission for the un human rights council chaired by a former judge of the international criminal court found that the blockade constituted collective punishment of the population of gaza and was therefore unlawful . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/a.hrc.15.21_en.pdf ) now one last thing - most people do n't know that gaza has been under an economic blockade ** since 2001 ** : according to the un conference on trade and development ( unctad ) , in january ** 2003 ** : ` ( t ) he israeli ** blockade ** and closures over the past two years had pushed the palestinian economy into such a stage of ` de-development ' that as much as us $ 2.4 billion had been drained out of the economy of the west bank and the gaza strip ' [ 9 ] this makes it obvious that the blockade started much earlier than hamas ' election in january 2006 . 
  also , according to hamas spokesman osama hamdan , israel opened gaza 's borders in 2006 for 70 days out of the entire year . 
  that is a blockade whether you like it or not , and it means hamas was elected * into * a blockade , and never given a chance to show how well they can govern the land . 
  tldr : it 's illegal, 
  what really astounds me is how often we hear this silly argument that israel has to `` defend itself '' from rockets . 
  but we are never told that palestinians need to defend themselves from murder . 
  according to the israeli human rights organization b'tselem , [ 565 palestinians ] ( http://www.btselem.org/statistics ) were killed by the idf since 2009 . 
  so palestine is illegally occupied according to un resolution 242 . 
  there is an illegal embargo on gaza for nearly 10 years that the un and eu have both condemned as collective punishment . 
  the un has asked for the embargo to be lifted 15 times now , if i recall correctly . 
  and palestinians are routinely killed by the idf on occupied territory . 
  but somehow israel is defending itself . 
  it 's really an amazing feat of mental gymnastics . 
  it would be like when germany invaded france and the french resisted , and the world keeps telling the french to stop resisting because germany needs to defend itself whilst on french soil . 
  i actually read a couple years ago that american mormons were moving in large numbers to central finland and creating their own christian communities . 
  not sure if this is true though since i have n't heard anything about it since, 
  this is a fantastic video .
