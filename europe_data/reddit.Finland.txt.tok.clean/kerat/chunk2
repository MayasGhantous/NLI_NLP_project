  but it should be noted that finland 's most important daily newspaper , the helsingin sanomat , has been [ propagating a pro-nato view over the past few months ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/should-finland-join-nato-201441813553512965.html ) :  `` among other prominent finnish actors with a pro-nato agenda is helsingin sanomat , the most influential finnish daily newspaper and the largest subscription newspaper in the nordic countries . 
  in 2006 , the then editor-in-chief janne virkkunen confirmed that the paper was in favour of finland joining nato . 
  ... as was to be expected , helsingin sanomat has featured a great deal of pro-nato advocacy during the ongoing crimean crisis . '', 
  i meant to say that the figure * does include * those on temp jobs and such , which is why it seems so low to u/frankster . 
  i 'll amend my comment . 
  first of all - i should amend my wording from `` extreme poverty '' to `` outrageous poverty '' since so many people have been so butthurt by my lax usage of the term `` extreme '' . 
  despite the fact that i was using it anecdotally and stipulated outright in the comment that i was comparing it to my own experiences in europe . 
  so the un definition is hardly applicable here . 
   care to explain to me how even people who live in housing projects and poor areas afford to eat then ? 
  well many do n't . 
  according to [ this link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_the_united_states#understating_poverty ) 17 % of americans `` live in poverty '' according to the old measures , and according to the census bureau 's 2011 updated measures , about ** half ** of americans live in poverty . 
  as for food security - approximately 14.5 % of americans are food insecure , meaning they literally do not know where their next meal will come from . 
   gini does not mean that the poor are as poor as the people in africa . 
  again : extreme poverty there ** compared to what i 've seen in europe . 
  ** no one ever talked about africa . 
  and joseph_zachau said he 'd prefer poland over detroit . 
  again , no one mentioned africa . 
  what aboriginal people did `` most of the eu '' wipe out ? 
   so i find 6 % to be surprising i think that figure ~ ~ does n't ~ ~ does take into account those who are on temp jobs and such - which is why the unemployment might seem artificially low . 
  edit : fixed brainfart, 
  why quote me if you are n't going to read what i said ? 
  extreme poverty there ** compared to what i 've seen in europe . 
  ** i 'm not talking about swaziland or uzbekistan . 
  yes , compared to most of the eu , the us has extreme poverty, 
  why are you `` oh christing '' me and dropping a single article like that means something ? 
  wow you found an article on the internet !, 
  do you know how many articles i can find that will claim the us has obscene levels of poverty ?? 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.nclej.org/poverty-in-the-us.php ) or [ here ] ( http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/poverty-line-grows-under/2014/01/08/id/545892/ ) . 
  furthemore , i said : `` given the amount of extreme poverty there ** compared to what i 've seen in europe ** '' your response : `` oh christ '' - then you link an article comparing the us to `` the rest of humanity '' . 
  then you mocked me as if poverty in the us is `` having only 1 iphone '' . 
  there are places in new york , philadelphia , jersey , la , that i would n't dream of entering . 
  that does n't happen too often in europe . 
  10 % of americans are [ food insecure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_the_united_states#food_security ) . 
  so hey , maybe they have 3 iphones but do n't know where their next meal is coming from . 
  also [ 30 % of americans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_the_united_states#food_security ) live paycheck to paycheck . 
  the poverty threshold has not been updated since 1955 . 
  * when methods similar to orshansky 's were used to update the food basket using prices for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier , it was found that the poverty line should actually be 200 % higher than the official level being used by the government ... *, 
  you 've never been to the us have you ... 
  i 'm actually surprised that the gdp per capita is so much higher in the us given the amount of extreme poverty there compared to what i 've seen in europe . 
  having said that , i obviously have not travelled throughout all of europe , particularly the eastern european eu countries but still , colour me surprised . 
  honesty everything you say is a weak attempt to excuse or legitimise what 's going on . 
  50 % of israelis oppose the occupation ? 
  so what ? 
  how does that change what the palestinians are going through ? 
  if 50 % of americans were against the iraq war , would that stop or excuse the killing ? 
  and yes , they pay palestinians more than they would be getting elsewhere . 
  but not as much as israelis . 
  there 's an economic benefit to it obviously , or they would n't bother . 
  but there 's an entire area called area c that palestinians are prohibited from building in because of these settlements . 
  the world bank estimates the palestinian economy would be boosted by 30 % if they were allowed to build there . 
  so yes , the factory pays more to those workers . 
  but no , the palestinians as a whole would be infinitely better off without those settlements . 
   think about it : if sodastream goes bankrupt , who suffers most as a result ? 
  the handful of israeli entrepreneurs who are still worth millions ? 
  or the hundreds of palestinians who made five times what their neighbors did and who now have to join the massive ranks of the unemployed ? 
  if sodastream moves its factory those palestinians working for them will suffer . 
  but the palestinians as a whole will get one step closer to ending the settlements and boosting their own economy on their own land . 
  i find this whole line of thinking absurd . 
  `` yes it 's illegal , but it helps a tiny fraction of palestinians even though the whole system is illegal . 
  so instead of targeting the system we should let it pass '' the settlements must be boycotted until israel stops building and expanding them . 
  they 've been illegal for 60 years and neither the un or eu could get them dismantled . 
  so now it 's up to the people and individuals to boycott them and take a stand to end this occupation and apartheid . 
  israel has different laws for jews and arabs in the occupied territories , but tries to excuse this by claiming it 's not israeli territory . 
  and yet they 've occupied the area for 60 years and keep expanding into it every month . 
  first of all - you are comparing a single man 's wage to the minimum wage in the palestinian authority . 
  ignoring the fact that you should be comparing it with the minimum wage in israel as it 's an israeli company - the man is earning $ 2000 dollars a month when the minimum wage is 377 . 
  he 's clearly a skilled labourer so the comparison is pointless . 
  what does a similar machine operator earn in israel ? 
  how many people are being paid below the israeli minimum wage ? 
  what are the land taxes that he 's paying as opposed to opening a factory in israel ? 
  secondly - go ask a sweatshop worker anywhere in the world if he wants to lose his job . 
  obviously no matter how miserable , he will say no . 
  they do it for survival . 
  in the man 's own words : * `` first off we need a job and an income to live -- i have a family and i need money . '' * this man does n't care whether it 's an illegal settlement or not . 
  the point is that the international community should care . 
  this company opened a factory knowing that it was illegal . 
  the fact that he has workers who are palestinians does n't change the fact that he is helping in their exploitation by supporting and legitimising illegal settlement building . 
  the article itself states : * palestinians are prohibited from building on the majority of area c . a world bank report last year estimated that the palestinian economy could be boosted by 35 percent if development of area c were allowed . 
  * moral of the story - you ca n't knowingly open a factory in an illegal territory and then try to take the moral high ground, 
  yes how benevolent of them !, 
  they might as well be a charity . 
  has nothing at all to do with exploitation or the miserably low wages they can pay palestinians . 
  i mean that 's why apple and samsung and nike use sweatshop labour right ?? 
  to provide them with jobs because otherwise they 'd starve . 
  they hire only palestinians for a reason . 
  and that reason is because there are different laws for palestinians and israelis in the west bank . 
  and by that logic sweatshops are also beneficial because otherwise the people would n't be employed . 
  i 'm on my phone so ca n't provide proper sources . 
  but if you google it you 'll find 100s of articles about it . 
  she basically accepted a contract to sponsor sodastream . 
  the problem is that it 's an israeli company with its main factory in a settlement in occupied palestinian land , and these settlements are considered illegal by the un , eu , etc she was also an ambassador for oxfam . 
  when she accepted the sodastream deal , there were calls for oxfam to ask her to stop or ditch her . 
  she preempted them by resigning as ambassador to oxfam , and filming a big commercial to sodastream for the super bowl . 
  at the time , she stated the split was due to differences of opinion . 
  now she has said that the criticism of sodastream is due to anti-semitism, 
  scarlett johansson came out yesterday and said that criticism regarding the sodastream debacle is due to anti-semitism . 
  yes scarlett , we complain about the illegal settlements because we hate jews , nothing more . 
  nothing to do with the un or international law or anything like that, 
  i do n't know what you mean by a pan-arabist being pluralist . 
  who have been the most pluralist leaders in the middle east in the last 100 years ?
