  you ca n't create an ethnic nationalist homeland with a 45 % minority of people who own all the land and do n't want to be a part of it . 
  as i already taught you yesterday , zionist leadership and intellectuals openly discussed `` the racial problem '' and `` the demographic problem '' of the unwanted ethnic group , and their expulsion . 
  before and after the nakba . 
  they also openly talked about conquering * more land * . 
  ben-gurion in 1937 : `` just as i do not see the proposed jewish state as a final solution to the problems of the jewish people , so i do now see partition as the final solution of the palestine question . '', 
  he also stated that `` after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the [ jewish ] state , * we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of the palestine . 
  '' * so you can cry all you want about ben-gurion 's fascist letter , but as ilan pappe pointed out - it 's a total red herring . 
   israel is willing to comply with 194 , returning the actual refugees , not their 5 million descendants which no one thinks should actually be returned , in the world . 
  oooh so you 're saying that international law states that israel should return a bunch of grannies to israel but ship their descendents elsewhere ? 
  wooww this is new to me . 
  of course this is more of your lies and no serious respectable person on this planet thinks that the descendants of refugees are n't also refugees . 
   it is not willing to take in 5 million people because they have one palestinian parent down a generation or two , and end the jewish state yes but any jewish person anywhere in the world has the `` right to return '' yes ? 
  hahaha what nonsense . 
  this is more apartheid , of course , as even conversions by palestinians is n't allowed by the israeli state . 
  no one asked you to be an ethnic nationalist state . 
  it is a vestige of 19th century european political theory . 
  that 's why israel is the only remaining apartheid state . 
   let me break down your last bullshit claim a bit further . 
  israel agreed to accept 194 on the basis of its terms , which state that peace must be in the hearts and minds of those `` returning '' , and which does n't define refugees . 
  it also is a nonbinding resolution . 
  ah yes , like the non-binding resolution that created israel . 
  let 's revoke both then !, 
   israel did not agree to implement it as a condition of admission to the un , so you 're lying there . 
  firstly - israel was allowed into the un ** on condition that it allows refugees to return ** . 
  resolution 273 refers to resolution 194 . 
  `` israel 's assurances in regard of the implementation of general assembly resolutions 181 ( ii ) and 194 ( iii ) were specifically mentioned in the general assembly 's resolution admitting israel to the united nations . 
  it is relevant to note that israel gave these assurances even though both resolutions had not been accepted by the arab states , and it can therefore be argued that israel 's assurances were not contingent on reciprocal arab action . '', 
  from : john norton moore , the arab-israeli conflict , volume iv , part ii , p. 1497 secondly , international law says nothing about what 's in the hearts of anyone . 
  international law is clear - refugees are allowed to go home . 
  i could cite these , but we both know you do n't care . 
  you 're a far-right ethnic nationalist and a state propagandist , you do n't really care about what international law says , as long as you can keep out the unwanted ethnicity . 
  you guys are always the same . 
  man , you are so intellectually dishonest that it 's just chilling . 
  like you have no qualms mis-citing and mis-representing things , do you ? 
  benny morris is a far-right ethnic nationalist . 
  he admits that the palestinians were ethnically cleansed , but states it was `` necessary '' for the creation of a jewish majoritarian state . 
  you take his words out of context to try to minimize the ethnic cleansing , by focusing * solely on expulsion orders * . 
  now , any intelligent human being can see that ethnic cleansing is not limited to expulsion orders , but to massacres and murders and violent upheaval . 
  so to sum up , benny morris , ( and all those other mainstream historians i cited ) admit openly that it was ethnic cleansing - this is academic consensus . 
  both morris and the original idf report make absolutely no qualms about how jewish atrocities and military attacks drove out palestinian * civilians * in the hundreds of thousands . 
  since you are totally dishonest , you only want to focus on the specific expulsion orders , which luckily for us , everyone knows is not the totality of ethnic cleansing . 
  a good old slaughter gets the job done just as well . 
  now , since you are an intellectual fraud , you then try to portray it as if the palestinians started the war . 
  they obviously did n't . 
  you pick a random murder on a bus by * civilians * . 
  well if this is our definition of war , then there were plenty of jewish murders of palestinians even earlier that we could take . 
  the truth is that the zionist militias were the first * state actors * who went on the offensive . 
  this is doubtless , and why the zionists lost zero land . 
  ben-gurion admits this himself when he says `` not the remotest jewish homestead was abandoned '' in the fighting before may 1948 . 
  so to sum up the academic consensus - sporadic murders broke out the zionist militias began their clean up operations and first massacres of palestinian civilians arab irregulars and volunteers began to fight back in certain villages finally other arab states joined in once 300,000 people had been ethnically cleansed . 
  that is the consensus , and what you try to quote from morris is nothing but you trying to hide these facts . 
   he also notes , on page 265 , that while expulsions became more common , they were not because of orders to do so but because individual commanders in the field chose to do so for military advantage . 
  yes - ie : ethnic cleansing . 
  he is defending the policy by saying that it was n't premeditated . 
  but he does n't deny that it did happen once it started . 
  and again you ignore all the slaughtering and massacres of defenceless villages . 
  the idf report itself talks about how some villages tried to make an agreement with the idf , but they ignored them and started psychological warfare . 
  this is ethnic cleansing without expulsion orders . 
  and since you 're so intent on fully quoting morris , let 's not forget this : `` the intelligence branch assessment is written in blunt factual and analytical terms ** and , if anything , contains more than a hint of `` advice '' as to how to precipitate further palestinian flight by indirect methods , without having recourse to direct politically and morally embarrassing expulsion orders ... ** morris spends a lot of time discussing massacres and atrocities that you are trying so hard to gloss over : `` almost all the massacres followed a similar course : a unit entered a village , rounded up the menfolk in the village square , selected four or ten or fifty of the army-age males ( in some places according to prepared lists of persons ... lined them up against a wall , and shot them . 
  some of the massacres were carried out immediately after the conquest of the village by the assaulting troops , though most occurred in the following days . 
  in some cases ( as in majd al kurum on 5 or 6 november ) the massacre occurred ostensibly as part of the unit 's efforts to force the villagers to hand over hidden weapons , ** though more often it seems to have been connected to a process of intimidation geared to provoking the villagers into flight ( as in ilabun , jish , etc. ) . 
  ** ie : you are totally misrepresenting morris and the history by trying to focus on expulsion orders , when atrocities and massacres played a much more important role in the ethnic cleansing . 
  and this is all completely inconsequential anyway . 
  the un has demanded that israel allow the refugees to return in resolution 194 . 
  the un even allowed israel to join the un * on condition that it allows the refugees to return * !, 
  and it has refused to comply 70 years later . 
   1 ) we were talking about expulsion . 
  now you 're shifting the goalposts to all people who left . 
  uhh no . 
  i was very obviously talking about ethnic cleansing . 
  i have repeatedly used the phrase ethnic cleansing . 
  this ethnic cleansing was a direct consequence of zionist intellectuals and leaders talking for decades of forced population transfer and an ethnically pure state . 
  you are the only minimizing the discussion to expulsion orders and totally ignoring zionist attacks on defenceless civilian villages . 
   today , the complaint is n't that the jnf does n't lease land to non-jews , it 's that they face more `` red tape '' , which has yet to be figured out in court . 
  wow look at that dishonesty . 
  pure lies . 
  the jnf ** refuses to sell land to non-jews ** . 
  now you 're trying to talk about leasing land to arab tenants !, 
  you play with the words to try to pass off lies . 
  the jnf official policy actually forbids leasing to non-jews as well , but the focus has always been on jewish-owned land . 
  the jnf does not sell land to non-jews , and the israeli government proposed to give land to the jnf to replace any land it sells to non-jews . 
  you cite this as if it solves the problem . 
  it is still textbook apartheid . 
  either way , it is n't clear that the jnf has still sold any land to non-jews at all , government replacement or not . 
   so you believe palestine is an apartheid state since the state prevents all sale of land to non-palestinians ? 
   fascinating . 
  say it . 
  do n't ignore it this time . 
  hahaha again i have to explain things to you . 
  the palestinian law forbids the sale of land to israelis . 
  ie : the illegal occupying power who are not citizens of palestine . 
  therefore , and see if you can follow this , the pa forbids sales of land to another country 's citizens . 
  a country that keeps expanding illegal ethnically pure settlements onto its land . 
  the israeli policy , on the other hand , forbids the sale of land * to its own citizens based on ethnicity * . 
  ie : apartheid . 
  i know that 's a difficult distinction for you to observe , but do try . 
  and what 's hilarious is that you are n't even denying that israel is an apartheid state . 
  the best you can do is to point at the palestinians and argue that if they have apartheid , it makes your apartheid ok . 
  this is textbook whataboutism . 
  anyway i 'm finished teaching you .
