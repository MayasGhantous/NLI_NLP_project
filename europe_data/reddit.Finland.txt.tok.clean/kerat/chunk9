  i have better things to do than sift through all of your word games and misrepresentation . 
  do n't worry dude , i know exactly who he is . 
  he misquotes and mis-cites references to appear knowledgeable , but like all diehard zionist propagandists , when you corner him with information he will always resort to [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) - * what about saudi arabia ? 
  what about hamas ?? 
  what about north korea ??? 
  what about the babylonians ?!, 
  * he 's carved a little profession on reddit of being a professional israeli government spokesman , and i 've wished for a long time that i did n't work such long hours so that i could respond . 
  today i had the time . 
   1 ) 300,000 arabs had fled . 
   2 ) 2 % were expelled . 
  read the idf document . 
  if you do n't have the ability to , read a history book . 
  because i pulled these quotes from my magic hat right ? 
  not by ` reading books ' ? 
  first of all - the report itself very clearly outlines what the reasons were for the ethnic cleansing :  the report then outlines what the idf intelligence service regards , in june 1948 , as the factors which precipitated the exodus , citing them `` in order of importance '' :  1 . 
  direct , hostile jewish [ haganah/idf ] operations against arab settlements . 
  the effect of our [ haganah/idf ] hostile operations on nearby [ arab ] settlements ... ( ... especially - the fall of large neighbouring centres ) . 
  operations of the jewish ] dissidents [ the irgun z'va ' i leumi and lohamei herut israel ] . 
  orders and decrees by arab institutions and gangs [ irregulars ] . 
  jewish whispering operations [ psychological warfare ] , aimed at frightening away arab inhabitants . 
  ultimative expulsion orders [ by jewish forces ] . 
   ... the intelligence service then gives a detailed breakdown and explana - tion of these factors , stressing that `` without doubt , hostile [ haganah / idf ] operations were the main cause of the movement of population '' . 
   ... the arab learned that it was not enough to reach an agreement with the haganah and that there were ` other jews ' of whom to beware . .  . . orders and commands by local arab commanders and leaders , the arab higher committee , and the transjordan government - accounted for some `` 5 per cent of the villages '' evacuated now , after he quotes these passages , benny morris then performs mental acrobatics and tries to cite * only expulsion orders * , which are listed as number 6 in the report itself . 
  this is where he derives his 5 % figure from - only direct expulsion orders , discounting total destruction of villages . 
  since then , he has corrected this assessment . 
  in his piece `` revisiting the palestinian exodus of 1948 , '' in eugene l. rogan and avi shlaim , editors , pages . 
  morris states :  [ t ] he documentation that has come to light or been declassified during the past ten years offers a great deal of additional information about the expulsions of 1948 . 
  the departure of arab communities from some sites , departures that were described in the birth as due to fear or i.d.f. 
  [ israel defense force ] military attack or were simply unexplained , ** now appear to have been tinged if not characterized by haganah or i.d.f. 
  expulsion orders and actions . 
  this means that the proportion of the 700,000 arabs who took to the roads as a result of expulsions rather than as a result of straightforward military attack or fear of attack , etc. 
  is greater than indicated in the birth . 
  similarly , the new documentation has revealed atrocities that i had not been aware of while writing the birth . 
  ** these atrocities are important in understanding the precipitation of various phases of the arab exodus . 
  in other words , the report was accurate and his attempt at defending the zionist militias in his original piece was flawed and incorrect . 
  the view that the vast majority were forcibly expelled by jewish forces is supported by avi shlaim , ilan pappe , simha flapan , nur masalha , eugene rogan , jon kimche , amongst others , not to mention the very report itself which is totally unambiguous . 
  believe it or not , i have to go to sleep and am tired of teaching you israeli history . 
  suffice to say that the jnf has never complied with the supreme court ruling and till today refuses to sell land to non-jews . 
  you cite no sources , of course . 
  that is textbook apartheid as the jnf receives land from the state . 
  and as for ben-gurion 's letter , the letter literally states `` we must expel the arabs '' , and you do n't want to believe this so badly that you have concocted a conspiracy theory where text that was scratched off would somehow have made ben-gurion say the exact opposite . 
  you are literally not reading what the letter says . 
  and then i 'm `` grasping at straws '' !, 
  the sheer hypocrisy could not get any more astounding . 
  what 's so funny is that you edited your original comment after reading the wikipedia article . 
  you did n't even know about the ` letter tampering ' conspiracy theory . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  well since you read the wikipedia article , you 'll know that morris also states :  '' ... the focus by my critics on this quotation was , in any event , nothing more than ( an essentially mendacious ) red herring -- as elsewhere , in unassailable statements , ben-gurion at this time repeatedly endorsed the idea of `` transferring '' ( or expelling ) arabs , or the arabs , out of the area of the jewish state-to-be , either `` voluntarily '' or by compulsion . 
   you stated that the 300k number took place before the war as some sort of concerted `` jewish '' / zionist policy ( ie . 
  not simply the actions of a separatist group ) ; that 's the point of contention . 
  what you 've shared here does n't corroborate your original statement . 
  read it again : `` altogether , the report states , jewish -- meaning haganah/i . d.f. , i.z.l. 
  and l.h.i. 
  - - military operations . 
  accounted for 70 per cent of the arab exodus from palestine . '', 
  70 % of 391,000 is 274,000 . 
  so according to the idf 's own internal document from june 1948 , the zionist militias were responsible for 274,000 palestinian refugees before any other arab state even got involved . 
   i imagine that you have some sort of google doc that you copy / paste these passages from , no i perform magic tricks . 
  or maybe just read books and take notes . 
  it makes you look disingenuous and , frankly , agenda-driven when you cherry pick quotes / passages and drop them into discourse where they 're not relevant . 
  hahahaha the guy asks me for direct references and i provide * numerous * references and quotations and then he bitches !, 
   no one is debating that and as such it is a moot point . 
  please see the last 200 comments written to me , which are most certainly debating that . 
   to offer other examples , india and large parts of sea was under colonial rule as well , but while having suffered for it they are at least rebuilding to some extent and the quality of life is consistently improving . 
  additionally , they are not constantly waging wars/committing genocide , ( taking the red khemers out of the equation ) . 
  i 'm glad you included the khmers , but india and sea are not vital geopolitical areas for the us and other global powers . 
  us national security council memorandum , 1958 , see [ here ] ( https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v12/d35 ) : `` if we choose to combat radical arab nationalism and to hold persian gulf oil by force if necessary , a logical corollary would be to support israel as the only strong pro-west power left in the near east '' us national security council memorandum [ jan. 1958 ] ( https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v12/d5 ) : the near east is of great strategic , political , and economic importance to the free world . 
  the area contains the greatest petroleum resources in the world and essential facilities for the transit of military forces and free world commerce . 
  the strategic resources are of such importance to the free world , particularly western europe , that it is in the security interest of the united states to make every effort to insure that these resources will be available and will be used for strengthening the free world . 
  memorandum , [ 1944 ] ( https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1944v05/d21 ) : furthermore , and of greater importance , united states policy should , in general , aim to assure to this country , in the interest of security , a substantial and geographically diversified holding of foreign petroleum resources in the hands of united states nationals . 
  this would involve the preservation of the absolute position presently obtaining , and therefore vigilant protection of existing concessions in united states hands coupled with insistence upon the open door principle of equal opportunity for united states companies in new areas . 
  these are just the declassified ones . 
  but the list of us intervention in the region in the last 50 years is completely incomparable to us intervention in sea . 
   yes the western powers cause a lot of horrible things , but at a certain point you got ta fix it your own self . 
  totally agree . 
   from the period between november 29 , 1947 and june 1 , 1948 , only 2 % of palestinian refugees became refugees because of expulsion . 
  this is 100 % false , according to the idf internal documents . 
  by may 1948 , 300,000 arabs had been ethnically cleansed . 
  this is so widely known now that i know you 're aware of it , you 're just betting that i do n't know about it . 
  it is stated in : david hirst , the gun and the olive branch : the roots of violence in the middle east , 1977 , pp . 
  benny morris , `` the causes and character of the arab exodus from palestine : the israel defence forces intelligence branch analysis of june 1948 , '' 1986 , pp . 
  sami hadawi , `` bitter harvest : a modern history of palestine '' . 
  morris ' analysis of idf documents are most interesting : '' `` a great deal of fresh light is shed on the multiple and variegated causation of the arab exodus in a document which has recently surfaced , entitled `` the emigration of the arabs of palestine in the period 1/12/1947 -1 / 6/1948 . 
  dated ** 30 june 1948 ** , it was produced by the israel defence forces intelligence branch during the first weeks of the first truce ( 11 june-9 july ) of the 1948 war . 
  `` by 1 june , therefore , according to the report , the refugee total was 391,000 , give or take about 10-15 per cent . 
  altogether , the report states , jewish -- meaning haganah/i . d.f. , i.z.l. 
  and l.h.i. 
  - - military operations . 
  accounted for 70 per cent of the arab exodus from palestine . 
  [ t ] here is no reason to cast doubt on the integrity of i.d.f. 
  intelligence branch in the production of this analysis . '', 
   the first killings of the war were 5 jews , killed on a bus by an arab gang . 
  ah yes , as all wars of course are started by random citizens of a particular ethnicity . 
  new york must have 10,000 wars every year !, 
  some random murders do n't mean a war had begun . 
  it was the zionist militias that began the war , and this is testified to by chaim weizman , menachem begin , and david ben-gurion . 
  weizman stated to the un special committee in june 1947 that he had to ` hang his head in shame ' because of jewish murders of palestinians . 
  so by your logic , these murders by jewish immigrants should count as officially starting a war . 
  ben-gurion openly states that `` in operation nachshon the road to jerusalem was cleared , and the guerillas were expelled from haifa , jaffa , tiberias , safad while still the mandatory was present . 
  it needed sagacity and self-control not to fall foul of the british army .
