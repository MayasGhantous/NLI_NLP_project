more like 20 .

  i actually have a question for a german user : when the case snowden was hot , der spiegel got quoted quite much as a source . 
  where does it stand ? 
  there 's no unbiased answer to that question . 
  i do n't think * true * `` neutral '' media could even exist . 
  mostly everyone with political beliefs either think their beliefs are objective and based on true facts . 
  best we can hope is not to get actual falsehoods or scripted fiction , covering of most of important things instead of unimportant , reporting and presentation that aspires to engage our rational mind instead of just getting emotions boiling , and journalists who back their case with good , solid research . 
   would all the nato members agree on invoking the article 5 ? 
  good luck with that with ` heroes ' like erdogan or orban . 
  ... have we been reading the same news ? 
  the point of  * [ censored ] * kind of escapes me . 
  links to articles by yle ( they certainly do n't like mr immonen , but they 're in english at least ) . 
  there have been some r/europe threads but you can look for them by yourself . 
  ** multiculturalism ** [ mp immonen made a manowar-ish facebook update calling for a fight against ` nightmare of multiculturalism ' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_mp_calls_for_fight_against_nightmare_of_multiculturalism_no_comment_from_party_leadership/8182155 ) some commentary : media certainly did n't like that . 
  posting the update on anniversary of ut\u00f6ya did n't help ( `` is this mere rhetoric or call for actual fight ? 
  is breivik counted as fellow fighrter ? 
  '' ) , neither that that mr immonen has recently publicly associated himself with a self-described neonazi group called svl ( finnish resistance movement , an import from sweden ) . 
  reactions have varied from `` how can someone oppose multiculturalism '' to `` well that sounds bombastic , but yeah we oppose multiculturalism '' . 
  not much actual discussion . 
  everyone seems to use their own definition of ` multiculturalism ' , what it entails and what it means to oppose it , depending whether they oppose it or not . 
  [ the big demonstration . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/diversity_rally_gathers_15000_in_helsinki/8188896 ) speaking of svl , they had their own demonstration-turn-violent [ in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/seven_jyvaskyla_demonstrators_still_in_custody_two_swedes_among_them/8198255 ) ( and before you ask , either there 's a mass conspiracy involving the police , media and all the eye-witnesses , or there were n't any violent leftists around . ), 
  ** regular news ** [ prime minister still opposes greece debt cancellation no matter what imf does ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/sipila_imf_decision_on_greek_aid_programme_doesnt_change_finnish_line/8196992 ) [ new us sanctions against russia included some finnish businessmen ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/us_sanctions_update_wont_affect_relations_with_finland/8196105 ) [ in portland , greenpeace staged a protest against a finnish icebreaker leased to shell ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/detained_finnish_icebreaker_leaves_portland_port/8194441 ) [ defence minister says finnish defence forces prepare for the possibility that ` green little men from russia ' try to take \u00c5land ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/minister_niinisto_finland_needs_to_rethink_its_defence_of_aland/8193007 ), 
  the recent leftist demonstration of 15 000 ... consisted of booing and yelling at politicians . 
  last time the leftist anarchists raised anybody for something violent on any large scale were the independence day ` protest ' last winter i guess ? 
  that was quite small crowd ( ~ 200 , certainly not thousands ) that got near total public condemnation , and they caused mostly property damage ( broken shop windows and stuff ) ^ 1 . 
  not nice , but i can see that violence against people draws media interest at least as efficiently than violence against lamp posts . 
  especially when the very same neo-nazi organization wants to organize street patrols for ` public safety ' . 
  ^ 1 and the demonstration year before * that * when some of the anarchists managed to hit horses of the mounted police got even more negative response . 
  according to finnish reports , total of 3 persons were attacked , one guy apparently being the particular target . 
  large number of arrests might have been caused because the other ` peaceful protesters ' tried to form a line to stop the police from interfering with the beating , and the police says the whole attack looked premeditated . 
  ( according to one eye witness they had one guy filming the episode . ), 
  i take enough notes to support my thought processes ( while listening ) and memory ( something to review ) , not try to transcribe everything the lecturer says . 
  good grief , [ s\u00fctterlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:s%c3%bctterlin.svg ) looks like a lotr fan 's mad idea for dwarfish handwriting based on germanic runes . 
  ( i learnt the old letters on my own in high school . ), 
  the old ` p ' and ` r ' were stupid , but especially the large letters were awesome . 
  ` r ' and 's ' are less stupid if one sees how they can be seen as print counter-parts with easy ` joining lines ' . 
  but never understood the old ` p ' . 
  it looks both ` j' and 'n', 
  that sounds sensible . 
  while joined handwriting was most useful during the age of liquid ink pens , it is still useful ( allows slightly faster writing ; no need to raise pen from paper ) . 
  i personally blame that the different versions of official ` cursive handwriting ' issued by ministry of education have totally missed the point since the late 1980s . 
  the aim has been to make them resemble more and more ` print letters ' so that learning ` cursive ' would be easy , but most of intended joints of these monstrosities are unnatural ( and some are not even meant to be joined ) , and rightfully has left pupils to wonder what 's the point of ` cursive ' . 
  ( i remember thinking `` why i have to join these letters but not these , and why are this different and more difficult than normal print letters i can already do -- this is pointless and boring '' ) . 
  well , according to news reports and footage posted in thread , this serbian politician was a high-ranking person doing and advocating very * wrong * things . 
  like , the reason there * was * a memorial in srebrenica . 
  however , that 's a question of religious and cultural ( in ) tolerance . 
  ideologies that are ( or used to be ) called ` racism ' were based on a notion of ` race ' ( maybe ` ethnicity ' can be counted in , too ) that was thought to be something * biological * and which could be determined from superficial things like skin colour or shape of skull ( or often some made-up characteristics for political reasons ) ; it used ( almost pseudo ) - scientific categories that have been mostly rendered obsolete by modern genetics ( sure there are genetic differences between populations living apart from each other , but it certainly does n't make sense to draw arbitrary lines between mongoloids and caucasians and whatnot , when we actually have good understanding of genetic make-up of humans around the earth , and certainly the actual genetic differences are very different thing than the differences that were thought to exist in the early 20th century racial thinking ) . 
  and important ideological characteristic was the idea some races were thought to be ` superior ' in a ways which would ( by some giant leaps of logic ) justify many kinds of idiocy and evil acts . 
  of course , some people might be old style racists who just disguise their internal motivations as `` criticism of culture '' . 
  and * of course * race , culture and ethnic identity are concepts intermingled in various ways . 
  and psychological motivation for `` traditional '' racism and everything that 's also called `` racism '' today might be the same fear of unknown and other different-looking people with different customs . 
  but calling every kind of hatred ` racism ' just muddles the terminology . 
  and anyway , the important thing is n't if something or somebody is `` racist '' or not ; important thing is the various reasons * why * racism is wrong and terrible , and if someone argues for ideas or ideology that shares some of those reasons , then one should criticize them for * those reasons * , not just dub them `` racist '' . 
  an interesting highlight about new government : * [ finns party leader mr. soini chose the seat of foreign minister instead of finance minister , against expectations ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/stubb_becomes_finance_minister_soini_takes_foreign_affairs_portfolio/8021678 ) . 
  while foreign minister is a high-profile cabinet member , the position of finance minister is considered stronger in domestic politics . 
  * immediately confronted with the russian counter-sanction blacklist that includes ( long-time political antagonist ) green party politician hautala . 
  [ yle ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/foreign_minister_soini_plays_down_russian_blacklist_says_its_no_surprise/8032506 ) , [ finland times ] ( http://www.finlandtimes.fi/national/2015/05/31/17167/hautala,-88-other-eu-politicians-blacklisted-by-russia ) some minor news : * [ school terms end ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/graduates_celebrate/8030871 ) ; [ traditional celebrations occur ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/police_break_up_ad_hoc_end-of-term_celebrations/8032394 ) * [ minor fuss whether finnish fa voted for blatter ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_fa_denies_blatter_support_report/8032645 ) * [ finnish ( aspiring ) professional athletes to lose special training arrangements and some other perks during their military service ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_sportsmen_lose_shorter_military_service_stint/8014010 ) something you might have missed previous week : * [ finnish military began sending letters to reservists , informing them about their war-time role ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/finland/11621512/finland-tells-900000-reservists-their-roles-in-the-event-of-war.html ) ^ ( such a newsworthy event that i can link to a uk newspaper instead of our public broadcaster ... ), 
  i never understood the germany 's eagle 's weight problems . 
  why not to stick with just one design ? 
  the most massive is the [ parliament ] ( https://www.bundestag.de/blob/218824/c0c38373542572f4f9229b427bab219b/adler-data.jpg ) [ eagle ] ( https://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a7569.jpg ), 
  i do n't like the finland one , the blue colour of the cross clashes with the background blue of eu flag . 
  let me introduce you the term [ `` crisis of faith '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_of_faith ), 
  well ,  what 's next ? 
  an ultra-orthodox jew angry for being turned down for head-chef at sal 's seafood palace ? 
  it * is * quite inane comparison . 
  head-chef of a seafood restaurant can be expected to prepare ( and taste ) seafood . 
  a cook who does n't do pork ? 
  far more reasonable , unless the student enlisted in a programme that specifically trains pork chefs . 
  interestingly that practice was abandoned only for * modern * names . 
  thus , if the current prince of wales would take the name `` george ( whatever the number is ) '' , he will be called `` george '' in finnish , too , but his grandfather is and will be referred as `` yrj\u00f6 '' . 
  [ / not confusing at all ], 
   taisto ... [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taistoism ) . 
   meri-tuuli * merituuli * might actually work , but the compound name meri-tuuli instead is just awkward . 
  ( `` merituuli '' is the word for `` sea wind '' , and in my opinion about as good as any other nature name , but `` meri '' and `` tuuli '' ( wind ) are also quite common names , and combining them into compound / double name `` meri-tuuli '' looks like a pun . 
  personally , for men 's names i like traditional ( christian ) or mythological finnish names , like * juha * ( johannes , john ) , * hannu * ( also johannes ) , * lauri * ( laurentius , lawrence ) , * matti , matias * ( mattheus , matthew ) , * olavi * ( olaf ) [ examples of the former ] , * kalevi * , * v\u00e4in\u00f6 * , * ilmari * , * antero * , * tapio * [ and latter kind of names ] . 
  bad names category would include also * urpo * ( originally neutral name , now means `` idiot '' ), 
   how could it not , finland is n't even trying to give its citizens the tools needed for communicating with her neighbors !, 
  totally * removing * swedish as a school subject , well that 's a proposition i 've never seen . 
  what if the new government ends up doing nothing to the status of swedish language , and rkp/sfp 's `` if you do n't vote for us , the finnish will take away your precious swedish language '' fear mongering scare tactics turn out to have been not based in reality at all ? 
  you know , i do n't know what or how people in ankdammen think , but i really do n't think ncp or centre hate swedish speaking populace . 
  some of the ps people are more radical but i doubt they will be able to implement their wildest dreams in this coalition government .
