  and maybe an eu wide defensive force but i do n't know if the swedens population is ready for that because they are not possibly told the full realities their government works in . 
  ( but that is true in all countries ) what finland would want would be an defensive alliance with the nordic countries but i dont think sweden would ever be ready for that because it just would not be powerfull enough . 
  and there i must agree . 
  the right answer for defense is either eu defence force , smaller co-operative of eu nations , nato , or world government . 
  sorry for the wall of text . 
  i had time . 
  the day you do even passable rye bread maby . 
  in finland even if you are in the capital you dont need to interact with anyone if you dont want to . 
  just pass them by looking at nowhere in particular and you are golden . 
  you can even walk through forest straight to the center of helsinki because the central park is left as an forest like that all the way to deepest hinterlands . 
  in all seriousness , yes there are places like that , especially in the north . 
  law is almost sacred . 
  exept in traffic where everyone speed . 
  but for example 96 % of finns have trust in police . 
  brake the law and you brake the nation . 
  my parents live in the forest so they mainly use wood but i have my house heated with central heating . 
  whatever they burn . 
  well , eu has already brougth us closer so the closeness will remain for a time but without a single peace keeping and power partitive force we will in time divide and start to compete against eachother . 
  if eu would break right now there would still be peace in our life time but after 50-100 years we would be at eachothers throats again . 
  in that state of perpetual war we were before . 
  i think people are really not understanding the power of peace the eu has . 
  because they either do not know their history or are wifully ignorant of what their grand parents still remember . 
  with all its faults the eu is the best thing that has ever happened to 20-60 years old people on this continent . 
  no more they have to die in wars . 
  i fucking love taxes . 
  i am no specialist in this question in any sense but the finnish rap i enjoy : [ mnttt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy55uktogsq ) [ asa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv55hdueokw ) [ rutger hauer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw-ggxlam_a&amp;list=rd5is9fwadufa&amp;index=11 ) [ evil st\u00f6\u00f6 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjp5dmh-r6s ) [ paperi t ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmcum6ehfi ), 
  fucking tons of lakes , forests and nature in general and the ability to adventure it all because of [ freedom to roam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam ) . 
  in finland violent attacks agains the police are very uncommon and very newsworthy . 
  a different matter indeed are those drunkards who want to wrestle and then challenge the police to test their strength . 
  the police will take up on the challenge and then shortly proceed to take the drunkards to the drunk tank . 
  that would not be newsworthy . 
  hoping for stronger eu and britain applying for membership twenty years from now, 
  sweden : soft as fuck ( a finnish guy and a swedish guy meet on the border . 
  the finn stares at the swede . 
  the swede feels tears coming to his eyes . 
  the finn is faceless . 
  the finnish guy approaches the swede and hugs him like a bear . 
  the swede starts to cry from all the emotions . 
  the finn stays silent ), 
  russia is only as big as sahara . 
  they could join if they would be more free and democratic and have the same kind of an idea of an europe as the rest of us have ( well i do n't know if there is an idea but maybe there is an feeling of building something that is good for us all ) . 
  if they would want to be part of this project and not the boss of it and give their people right to dissent and if their leaders are cool about being not a great nation but a part of great collaboration , then maybe , ok they can join . 
  well right now i live in a highly populated area so i would rather accept regulation fascism than no regulation at all . 
  even in highly regulated environment i can have some freedom . 
  i ca n't have any freedom being opressed by the strong or being dead . 
  if there is only few people around then there being no regulations can work because we can make social contracts betweenthe few of us one on one . 
  if there is a lot of people , full on regulation masochism is better because otherwise the world will become a nightmare mess of pollution , violence , nepotism and murder . 
  in a real world , the more people there is living in an area , the more requlation i am willing to accept . 
  haha ... ... thanks for your heroic construction workers estonia !, 
  you are making finnish infrastructure great again . 
  it would be interesting to see a movie about the finns at the time when they were moving north in great numbers at the kings command and meeting the sami peoples and ancient finnish tribes . 
  i think there could be some great drama there . 
  or making a tv series about a boy who is forcefully conscripted from his home village to join the 30 year war and becoming a [ hakkapeliitta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) . 
  his experiences in the ravaged lands and the banal futility of it all . 
  or a ganster movie from the time of prohibition . 
  or just a gonzo style travelling movie where the protagonists take part in all the weird summer games we finns like to have in an totally foreign cultural context . 
  but knowing the hollywoods interest in spectacles and of course the interest of audiences seeing an american hero in a foreign situation it would probably be some american volunteers story in the finnish winter war . 
  you are such an perv , 
  my mom can do this to me . 
  anyone else exept my dear mother or so are no no . 
  we are brothers in this . 
  lets hug and kiss on the cheeks , ... wait, 
  exept if you purposefully do so !, 
  then you should fast say you are sorry . 
  there is a reason why evolution madeour brains as big as they are and that is because social interactions are fucking complicated !, 
  you are a swede . 
  i know you either expect a list of black metal bands that you already know or basshunter . 
  i will give you neither . 
  i will give you pop .

  never ... you cant ' offend anyone by asking . 
  no , man , no do n't apologize . 
  you just wanted to learn about stuff . 
  never apologize about that . 
  have you ever been in the same weather and spatial configuration fora a 10 000 years and then try to make a small talk about that ? 
  because that is about how it feels . 
  fuck no . 
  if one of them had democracy then maybe . 
  i think after living this long in eu i can not even fathom living in a place where there is no democracy and liberty . 
  easteners are talkative ( they will first tell their entire life history and then ask yours , maybe sing a bit ) . 
  westeners are silent ( they ask for your beer can , beat it to their head untill it breaks and then smile derangedly before stabbing you lovingly with a knife ) , northeners just want to be left alone ( personal space ) to kill things . 
  southeners are snobs who think they own the culture , history and art even though it comes from everywhere else but . 
  the truth is we are all just similar finns and pretty happy to have guests and party in this mundane everyday life . 
  my daily work load is 7h and 15 minutes . 
  it does not matter how much time i eat or whatever as long as i do that . 
  edit ( i probaly should have said that all the breaks are not part of the working hours . 
  so i can have 3 hour lunch break but i should still work the 7,25 h ), 
  ah , that explains a lot , you are what we call an ostrobothnian heretic `` wink '' . 
  probably your parents are also heretics or they just practise these thing when you are not around . 
  you are probably from the nothern ostrobothnia region where there are alot of these cultists that call themselves `` lestadiolainen '' . 
  have you never been drunk on juhannus watching the giant bonfire ? 
  what part of finlad are you from ? 
  yes , but far more complicated than anything that has come before . 
  i am . 
  i love how our ancient history is put into poetic form even though i know in reality it is probably not so epic . 
  but i do feel the goosebumps when i read about the exploits of our great ancient warriors , wise men and scientists . 
  and i feel the vibes when i read about the more recent heroes . 
  i feel the pride and shame what our nation does and i feel great joy when someone from another land comes and tries to learn our customs . 
  even better if he/she loves our country enough to work here or even go through the compulsory military training .
