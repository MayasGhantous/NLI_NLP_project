  i see no harm in streamlining that . 
  the only people who oppose such optimization are the same kind of people who refused to take foreign help in the great famine because they thought that getting something for nothing was unreligious and immoral while still living from their deceaced relatives assets and inheritance .

  [ our peacekeepers ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vbqetmrmnt4/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  i know this kind of thing can be dowvoted to dust but it really shows in my opinion what we can be . 
  a power . 
  a true power with that naivety to do good that defies all realpolitik , but of course backed with a huge gun . 
  because believing in humanity and doing good is always more effective if you have a huge gun in your pocket to show to the sociopaths of the world you mean business . 
  and the the business is to make the world a great place to live in . 
  i love this picture . 
  it shows our progression from anger against each other to anger agains the injustice in this world . 
  love it . 
  it seems that your main consern is `` how can we stay independent even though the global trend is to accumulate into larger political masses ? '', 
  so you know it will happen anyway but you just do n't want it to so you would be ready to sacrifice your country rather than facing the odds . 
  i say that it is hard to face the odds , but we must do it now when it is possible and not when it is too late . 
  if you have some knowlege about information networks you will know that there are powerfull knots in every one of them . 
  the way to form a truly democratic entity in a large co-operative is hard , but i do n't think that we can not do it . 
  there are many examples of information networks where small inputs can do huge amount of change into the whole . 
  like for example the unwillingness to sell cheap wheet to rome by egypt . 
  it destroyed the whole logical chain . 
  why could not small countries have such power together in eu ? 
  many small countries can overpower the one large one . 
  if accumulation of power is inevitable we must do so in our own terms and not when it is too late to affect anything . 
  im harsh in this post . 
  i got drunk and mine inner beast took over me . 
  australia , nz and canada are basically the only countries in the world that can do better alone . 
  well maybe you can throw peru there as well . . on a good day . 
  it 's pretty much like cherry picking on a one existing golden cherry farm so that you can argue about how easy it 's picking cherries mentioning those countries . 
  no offence but i think your argument was very post truth . 
  what are those problems you are talking about . 
  i would like to hear them so that i could think about them . 
  in my opinion in the end federalized eu is a must thing if we are to stay independent as countries . 
  as counter intuitive as it seems . 
  but if we are to survive as free democracies we must either unite and protect our freedom and liberty together or divide and be consumed by other world powers . 
  the question is : what are those liberties and freedoms that we give to individual countries , so that we will not become just another authoritarian mock democracy and what freedoms do we take away from individual countries so that we do n't become just a loose band of nations that have no real cohesion that everyone can exploit as they wish . 
  i think a constitution that says what eu is about and a debate of its contents would be in order . 
  and that the debate would be the whole continent wide . 
  not just representatives but the people as well . 
  we could make a true statement of our values and our will to achieve greatness together . 
  now it seems that without such an discourse and honesty we will fall victim to this age of post truth and money influencing politics and become just another failed attempt at realizing mankinds full potential . 
  if we make a federalized eu without constitution that most of us stand behind , the eu , its dreams and its power are just a house of cards . 
  then again a common worry ( i will not say threat just yet ) might unite us more . 
  i belive that eu will emerge as the new de facto world leader in technology , science , philosophy and freedom . 
  by integrating our economic zone into a functioning superpower of now sleeping human ( like russia is a sleeping bear or the china is a sleeping dragon ) that will then bring good things for all humanity . 
  then again i am a hopeless believer in a better future . 
  ( i do fear that donald trump and the global populist movement might leave the us in such a mess the throne is not taken it is just left to be taken on the ground . 
  then we are just a flickering light in a black night that makes no difference how the end of man will happen . 
  do n't go in to the darkness usa , do n't you dare to go in to the darkness . ), 
  we could have more !, 
  there 's plenty of room for them .

  unfortunately nature tourists are yet to find out about the summer in the [ lake district ] ( http://www.saimaageoparkproject.fi/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/02/etusivulle-2.jpg ) of finland .

  there are great opportunities for you in finland , the high tech scene is booming , especially the bioinformatics and game engineering scenes . 
  the computer harware sceen is right now a bit low because of layoffs in microsoft and nokia . 
  but for an entrepenour there is therefore right now a great opportunity to hire real old timers and coding heroes from those layoffs . 
  if you just want to be employed , know that we have all work no bullshit attitude towards work . 
  we do n't work so many hours in a week but those we do we do work really . 
  `` some people work for their whole lifes and get nothing done , we work little , but we get it done '' for raising a family this country is one of the best in the world because of the social programs we have .

  norwegians will make the money and energy , iceland will give us fish and culture , danish will make the food and beer , swedes will keep up the democracy and equality and the finns will take care of the education and natural philosophy and fight the wars . 
  some things must be centralized ( like defence , healthcare , ( natural monopolies like electricity etc. 
  ) , eu science mega projects , and upholding the principles of law like freedom of speach , and how things should be taxed ) , some things must be localized ( like how people see freedom according to their local culture , freedom to roam or not and localized laws how taxes are used and so on ), 
  do n't know much of it . 
  i guess most of it is shit like in everything .

  mika waltari 's [ the egyptian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_egyptian ) and [ the etruscan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_etruscan ) are one of my favourites . 
  [ the seven brothers by aleksis kivi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seitsem%c3%a4n_veljest%c3%a4 ) is a more known book about finns . 
  some say it 's the finest book ever written by any finn . 
  i do n't know about that because there are also other great books like our national epic [ kalevala ] ( https://blog.edu.turku.fi/puropeltoaidinkieli/files/2015/09/sammon_puolustus.jpg ) and new writers like [ sofi oksanen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sofi_oksanen ) who are really talented and win international awards . 
  how far east can our armies go peacefully ? 
  it works if everyone has the same attitude and laws are made to reflect it . 
  private ownership has sort of varying degree then . 
  everyone agrees that some things that are owned are owned absolutely ( like ones house or the the property in it ) but somethings are only owned partly ( like land ) . 
  then when one owns land he actually owns the right to profit from the land but other people also have some rights to it as well as citizens of that nation where that land is . 
  in this mindset no one can totally own something that people and their ancestors have lived on for more than 10 000 years . 
  but when one owns a car ( or some such ) that car is his and fuck everyone who tries to take it from him . 
  so , yeah . 
  a situation where eveyone have been very selfish for a long time and want to own stuff but because everyone are selfish and suffer no one to have huge amounts more power ( or wealth , which in the end is the same thing ) than them , they have agreed that some things have to be shared and some things can be competed and owned totally . 
  ( what is mine is mine , exept parts of it which are also yours , and what is yours is also partly mine exept the parts that are totally yours . ), 
  of course this also requires a population that will obey also those laws that ca n't be strictly enforced . 
  strict private ownership laws are of course needed in places where people can not be trusted to behave well and not damage stuff if they are allowed in somewhere . 
  [ nature ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ), 
  obviously one can not just trample crops . 
  the freedom to roam is for usage of forests , not for fields .
