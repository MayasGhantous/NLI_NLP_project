  it also looks like you have reconquered schleswig . 
  we have forgotten about karelia . 
  the russians can keep it , we have enough land anyway . 
  now petsamo on the other hand ... 
  owning petsamo would give finland drilling rights in the barents sea , that would be nice . 
  well i do n't know if bars should be allowed to make the decision . 
  maybe the landlord or whoever owns the building . 
  i can only imagine the stains on walls and roof if a club full of people smoke inside . 
  it 's pretty awesome . 
  in finland i could n't really go to bars because the smell inside them was horrendous due to the smoke , and it clogged up my nose . 
  and besides , playgrounds are for children , they are n't allowed to smoke either so why should they be subjected to second hand smoking because of some random parents ' smoking ? 
  it 's all good imo . 
  https://sanomapro.fi/opetus-ja-opiskelu/alakoulu/matematiikka the `` kymppi '' series is new apparently , there are only books for grades 1-3 in finnish . 
  the old `` laskutaito '' series has all lower elementary school math books . 
  add in the pension reform that has been going on for years . 
  you make it sound like we do n't have any issues and that we live in a laalaa land . 
  trust me , we have our own fair share of domestic issues . 
  thanks to our parliamentary system , we have never had majority rule . 
  as far as i know , all governments have been coalition governments . 
  sorry , i 'm not a fan of your society so that 's a no-go .

  i suppose you can twist that into these click bait headlines , but stubb meant that the finnish industry failed to respond to changing demands around the world . 
  apple saw the opportunity and seized it , that 's what our companies failed . 
  absolute values pls . 
  it 's amazing how all us papers took that very specific part of what our pm said . 
  it was one sentence which he said tongue in cheek . 
  could someone elaborate why basic income is any better than the current scheme with kansanel\u00e4kelaitos ( kela ) in finland ? 
  if we give everyone basic income , how is it any different from now ? 
  there would always be families and persons who mismanage their money and they 'd still have to visit kela to get help . 
  it would n't make the social security scheme any simpler than it is now and it would n't save any money either . 
  in finland we get a bit shy of 500 $ per month . 
  because the rosatom deal has been in the works for far longer than the crisis in ukraine has lasted . 
  majority of the plant owners will be finnish . 
  currently we import a shitton of electricity from russia , the plan is to become less energy dependent on them . 
  commonwealth stronk !, 
  all taxis in helsinki are ( almost ) brand new mercedes cars . 
  every single one , non-sedans excluded . 
  what the fuck being we share about 1000 kilometers of border . 
  afaik erkki tuomioja , our minister of foreign affairs , is the only one opposing the schedule of the sanctions . 
  so much ~ ~ freedom ~ ~ democracy that it is approaching infinity . 
  the most of the `` heat '' seems to be originating from turku anyway , you can have them , 
  it 's almost company vs. company level action . 
  sure it 's not that big , but for arma and games in general it 's kinda huge . 
  it 's not a mod though . 
  separate game with a different version of the engine developed by a separate company . 
  really ? 
  i think these long ops are really interesting , make my hands sweat .

  bro-tip : just ditch those fancy virtual scroll scripts , 
  if you 're interested , google magyar migration . 
  agreed . 
  please do n't hijack my mouse scrolling and try making it smooth . 
  it does n't even work when i scroll fast enough . 
  nice photos though . 
  you need to practice your reading comprehension . 
   i 'd say segregated camps would be ** the last measure **, 
  honestly though , physical abilities of men mean that they can overpower women quite easily . 
  i 'd say segregated camps would be the last measure for keeping the women safe . 
  i 'd say that you usually inherit at least the social status level of your parents , but you usually go above that . 
  rarely children do worse than their parents . 
  but yea , i guess the second generation of immigrants might feel bitter since they are n't at the level of natives . 
  social status is n't that heritable in nordic countries due to our education . 
  as long as the kids go to school and learn the language , their social status usually improves compared to their parents . 
  i 'm sure winter makes them pick up the pace a bit , 
  glorius siberian weather patterns await us . 
  the point of basic income is to reduce bureaucracy , it 's not about giving `` prosperous ready made lives '' to people . 
  the whole idea of it hinges on the facts that : a ) people want to earn more than the minimum viable amount you can live on . 
  b ) basic income is taxable income , which means that it 's gradually taxed away as you find better paying jobs . 
  but anyway , what was your point ? 
  i 'd say only in the mountains . 
  i 've never heard of roads shutting down during heavy snowfall here in finland . 
  no it is n't . 
  well that 's pretty fucked up . 
  http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/tornio.html in the middle of the darkest winter you get half an hour of daylight , otherwise dusk/dawn/night . 
  we had the old suuri muumijuhla game , made in 1996 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roinuy2njr8 point and click game mostly , but it was nice to see the whole house in 3d and walk through it . 
  naw , it 's m\u00f6rk\u00f6 . 
  i 'm surprised there are less lights west of moscow than in east . 
  legacy of ww 2 ? 
  the vapour has nicotine in it , does it not ? 
  i 'm tempted to post a pic of puke in a toiler , but i guess i 'll just spare you guys . 
  i 'd guess so too . 
  my favourite pizza has : kebab , red onions , feta , tomato slices and smetana . 
  not a fan of jalopenos , one or two is enough for the pizza . 
  that 's the price of a revolution . 
  news flash : every single news comment section is filled with hate and racism these days . 
  we have the same paper in finland and we have n't had a single article about refugees in it . 
  but i do remember that `` welcole to sweden '' article . 
  what does it matter ? 
  the poll is the only thing that matters . 
  of course , the little green men went on vacation to bulgaria 's sunny beach . 
  no it is n't . 
  you ca n't for example threaten to kill someone . 
  of course not . 
  sd will have to form coalition government even if they are the biggest party , that alone will wear the far-right edge of their policies . 
  or do you swedes have other substantial far-right parties i 'm not aware of ? 
  welcome to the world of proportional representation . 
  sorry , the title says `` islamic pigs '' , as in pigs that practise islam , as in muslim pigs .
