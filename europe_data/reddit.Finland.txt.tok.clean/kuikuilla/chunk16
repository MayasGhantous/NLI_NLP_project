  the people are just spacing themselves so that they have a better chance at nabbing a seat for themselves . 
  at least they are queuing up . 
  that 'd be my guess also . 
  uh , today the town has 13 000 inhabitants . 
  are you sure ? 
  as far as i know n\u00f6teborg was just one of the frontier bastions/castles . 
  what ? 
  colonial empires ? 
  but why is n\u00f6teborg on the map then ? 
  afaik the swedish intervention in the war made the peace of westphalia possible , so yes . 
  they did annex pomerania . 
  hah , what the fuck . 
  wait , you use the term `` rebel '' for that in english ? 
  why not just say that person/entity votes against party policy ? 
  uh , finland here . 
  reservists and various organisations and normal citizens think that the eu policy on this issue is fucked up . 
  does it ? 
  you can keep spewing out stupid bullshit but you also got ta bear the responsibility of said stupid shit . 
  afaik everyone from finland is a volunteer . 
  oh wow , the difference is quite big . 
  it was pretty obvious from the start that erdo\u011fan ran out of domestic enemies so he had to create a foreign one . 
  here 's a more detailed report : http://www.contraceptioninfo.eu/sites/contraceptioninfo.eu/files/map_cci-v5.pdf, 
  at least in finland girls have to consult a gynecologist before getting pills . 
  it 's not something you can just march into a pharmacy and buy . 
  sensible thing imo . 
  also another thing is that it costs . 
  their agenda consists of issues that swedish speaking finns have . 
  kymi , keh\u00e4 and oulu exercises are just military exercises , hardly any news . 
  in heraldry ? 
  hardly . 
  earth defence forces ? 
  it 's the nordic model : https://i.imgur.com/czq8oqn.png, 
  the amount of tax payer money that goes into that is miniscule compared to anything else tbh . 
  about 60000 children are born in finland annually , and if the pack is ~ 150 euros it 's less than 10 million euros . 
  seriously , ** that ** is the only thing that you 're wondering about ? 
  if the mother does n't want the package they can instead get 140 euros . 
  i wonder if the housing situation in sweden in general is like in stockholm . 
  i remembered that it was the golden banana but i was wrong . 
  yes , the original is a blue banana also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana, 
  x-road you mean ? 
  we 're developing that in finland too , eesti people just know how to market it better :p, 
  southern finland , sweden and denmark ( if they step up their game ) could form the second banana of europe : the blue banana ( because of the weather of course ) . 
  by your logic sweden would n't have existed during the time of kalmar union . 
  shit , true . 
  you 're correct , that 's norway spruce . 
  what a weird looking scots pine on finland . 
  i kind assumed so , but still on reddit you see a lot of people telling legends about dis that yell and spit while yelling and such . 
   probably not . 
  if a day is too much , then yeah , probably not . 
  people always assume it 's like what it 's like in american movies like fmj . 
  nope , at least in finland we do n't break men and turn them into soldiers , that would be fucked up . 
  probably handier if you 're out at the sea . 
  does n't fly off and dries faster since it 's ( probably ) wool . 
  so how do you think finnish defence forces teach their conscripts ? 
  anyone recognize the actual region of each dress ? 
  i 'm assuming these actually are the official `` national '' dresses ? 
  why would anyone want that ? 
  edit : is it a `` mandate '' if you change the rules of the game while people 's opinions stay the same ? 
  in finland we got a six party coalition few cabinets ago : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katainen_cabinet it was n't hugely popular among anyone . 
  rep\u00f6rting for duty < \u00f6, 
  it 's super8 & tab , not superb . 
  but anyway , i 've heard it many times be that on asot radio or anything . 
  i mean , have n't you heard this ever ? 
  what on earth are you blabbering about ? 
  you have a very weird idea of the military if you think they teach you to murder people in it , professional or not . 
  approaching my 30 's and i have never heard of such thing . 
  always omenal\u00f6rtsy . 
  i 'd just call that lihapiirakka :p dunno why l\u00f6rtsy only means the jam version to me . 
  what ? 
  l\u00f6rtsy with beer ? 
  or is there some kind of other l\u00f6rtsy other than the true \u2122 apple jam l\u00f6rtsy ? 
  i ca n't imagine anyone eating an apple jam l\u00f6rtsy with beer . 
  i concede that the motivation of a conscript * in an offensive war * probably will be lower than that of a volunteer who 's doing it as a job . 
   people who are forced to be there will not be as effective as a proper volunteer army . 
  i really doubt there is any big difference when you look at two average soldiers . 
  in a totally utilitarian sense it does make sense . 
  turkey just had a coup attempt in case you forgot . 
  ipas are hip because every brewery makes them . 
  all breweries make them because apparently they 're one of the easiest beers to make . 
  i do n't like them at all , except for one : fuller 's ipa . 
   israel has a different set of concerns from that of sweden sweden is n't finland . 
  women are not as strong as men - in general . 
  but what about women in the army ? 
  there are weak and there are strong women . 
  generalizing like that when we 're talking about volunteers in the army is nonsense . 
  you are assuming that being a women automatically means that they are inferior physically to every single man there is . 
  that is simply untrue . 
  what the fuck are you talking about . 
  you are n't making any sense . 
  because people do n't really need to be taught `` logistics , manufacturing , cleaning , cooking , communication '' since there already are people who know how to do those . 
  what people most likely do n't know is fighting as an army unit . 
  so in the context of defence of finland , teaching people in the army is more cost effective . 
  and besides , we already have civil service that men can do instead of army service . 
  it 's useless , the people just do some almost-chore-like-work for practically no pay . 
  the turku mainland area seems pretty liberal on the map compared to this : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/languages_of_finnish_municipalities_%282016%29.svg, 
  if you can see the coin , it 's not strong enough . 
  it 's not that hard :p, 
  i do n't get it . 
  the one on right simply has more tomatoes in it . 
  i can make better pasta than the one on left :p,
