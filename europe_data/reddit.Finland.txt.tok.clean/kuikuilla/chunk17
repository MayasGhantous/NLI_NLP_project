  stop with that fucking stupid `` joke '' . 
  it 's the italian syndrome . 
  all of the hams i 've tasted that were like on the right tasted spoiled . 
  immediate gag reflex . 
  there 's no reference for that claim . 
  i guess it 's in the law somewhere ? 
  ca n't be bothered to read finlex atm . 
  but but ... some people like mash with lots of milk in it :\\, 
  itt : italians who ca n't comprehend food . 
  porvoo ( one of the oldest cities in finland with a lovely old town part ) , kotka , hamina and mikkeli . 
  also the national road 6 should be added , it 's not a highway but it 's still a pretty major road going towards porvoo and kouvola from helsinki . 
  you better get used to directness if you want to live in a nordic country :d, 
  maps of finland are rather weird . 
  they 're missing major cities and roads . 
  it 's the revolution . 
  a quarter of it , anyway . 
  my flair should also give you a clue that i meant where in finland do you live , 
  where on earth do you live then ? 
  determination , grit , courage , hardiness , resilience and so on . 
  who cares . 
  naturally . 
  a workplace , a home and a summer cottage . 
  like every other finn , 
  you need a new lens , your current one is completely fucked up ( lots of chromatic aberration ) . 
  and if it 's a post processing effect you need to re-evaluate your priorities in life . 
  jam  all, 
  needs more ananas . 
  there 's no one-to-one translation for it . 
  sisu is sisu , rohkeus means courage . 
  new potatoes with butter : best thing ever . 
  i went to ski in andermatt , switzerland once . 
  being the finn i am it never occurred to me that you 'd need to use sun lotion that high up in the mountains with highly reflective white substance around you . 
  i skied for four hours and after that my skin started getting all tingly . 
  you could say i shed the skin on my face completely . 
  my face was red and painful for a week . 
  quite obviously the former . 
  urbanizing turkey etc. 
  that 's ridiculously expensive . 
  at nation parties ( osakunta ) in helsinki a beer is like 1 $ . 
  what the fuck . 
  i studied six years of swedish and had no idea . 
  same word belonging to both noun families ( ett and en ) ? 
  ~ ~ no they do n't . 
  they just say `` en ide '' like that . ~ ~, 
  i know . 
  our military 's ( fdf ) sole purpose is the territorial defence of finland . 
  secondary task is assisting law enforcement . 
  foreign deployments are a no go , i 'm not sure if there 's actually a law or agreement against that or not . 
  it has its uses . 
  forces can sustain casualties without becoming combat ineffective assuming they can recover the gear . 
  somebody has been playing kaiserreich too much :p, 
  so should party members only agree with the `` official '' party values ? 
  that just turns parties into echo chambers that do not evolve , it 's not healthy in the long run for the party . 
  i mean , i could see myself being a member of the green party , even though i disagree with their dogma of `` nuclear energy is bad hurr durr '' . 
  so a person should be 100 % compatible with the `` official '' values of the party in order to be in it ? 
  can you not be a member of the finns party and have a neutral stance against immigration ( i do n't know what putulukeso thinks about it ) . 
  what is the joke other than the photoshopped in `` moccamaster '' ? 
  hmm , true . 
  i have no idea where the hell i got that from . 
  edited my comment . 
  we are talking about adoption . 
  ~ ~ if that is n't `` successful implanting '' i do n't know what is . ~ ~ edit : what i mean is that adopted children will learn the values and culture of their parents . 
  where they come from is irrelevant as long as they are adopted as babies . 
  you really think so ? 
  this post is going pretty fast towards old school racism . 
  `` blacks are n't americans , go back to africa ! '', 
  camouflage for old people 's hunger games . 
  if you read more of the guy 's replies you can see that he seems to think that genetics define your ethnicity and that non-european baby raised by europeans in europe can never be european because genetics . 
  you are forgiven , i was just trying to trigger native helsinki people . 
  [ fins ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/lampanyctodes_hectoris_\\ ( fins \\ ) . png/300px-lampanyctodes _ hectoris _ \\ ( fins \\ ) . png ) [ finns ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?biw=1009&amp;bih=1074&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=finnish+people&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjf5pkgkz7sahugeywkhqamdrcqhyyiga&amp;dpr=1 ), 
  it 's quite amazing that people even agree with the guy you replied to ( he 's at 10 upvotes atm ) . 
  are people really this dumb ? 
  no , i 'm saying read a book if you think ethnicity is genetic . 
  you better read a book if you think it 's genetic . 
  are they ethnically chinese if the only similarities are the historical origin and physical appearance ? 
  meanwhile these would be the same as with other european : * language * cuisine * dressing style * art * pretty much anything relating to culture you ca n't say someone is n't ethnically something just because they look different . 
  ethnicity is n't genetics only . 
   helsinki  cuts southern most helsinki off and shows espoo and vantaa more, 
  it 's from the bi-annual main artillery exercise held in rovaj\u00e4rvi . 
  the footage is probably from the final salvos at the end of the whole exercise . 
  here 's some target area footage : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceetq1xduza the thing with artillery batteries is that you really have to shoot with them in order to figure out the spread of individual guns and the grouping of the battery as a whole . 
  otherwise the fire will be inaccurate making a whole battery worthless . 
  no , we use kvkk and pkm . 
  glorious mlrs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0ltsb_gu3g, 
  before more people wonder about the non-finnish equipment like the m249 and f-15 , it 's because this video is n't a showcase of the finnish defence forces , but a showreel of the ** combat camera ** team that go out to exercises and take photographs and videos and also make these videos . 
  conscripts do these . 
  yes we do you dumb fuck . 
  these titles are sickening . 
  i really doubt anyone in lithuania is `` waiting '' for an invasion . 
  rather they 're just preparing for the worst like anyone else with sense . 
  the food ? 
  but still , the mapping is completely arbitrary . 
  i could go and map finland to the least populous area of the continent and make it seem huge and map germany to the most densely populated area , making finland huge and germany tiny . 
  what would it mean ? 
  nothing since the mapping is completely arbitrary . 
  these maps make zero sense when you have no idea about the population densities of the continent . 
  passing in the eu level parliament is the first hurdle . 
  since eu has no legislative power over member nations , each individual nation has to ratify the eu agreements in their national parliaments . 
  what 's amazing is that even after the 30 years war europe still somehow came up top . 
  yea it 's a bullshit map .
