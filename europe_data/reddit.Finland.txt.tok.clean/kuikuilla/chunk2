  maybe it 's a typo or mistranslation . 
  but generally i think all kinds of `` i 'll cut your head off '' types of threats are fucked up regardless who says it and who is the target of the threat . 
  i ca n't take people like that seriously , it juts makes them seem barbaric and brutish . 
  i do n't see how this is the end of schengen area . 
  the schengen agreement does allow for heightened border control at special times of need . 
  now is that time . 
  that 's fucked up . 
  it 's not that the government is actively bussing people here , it 's that the railway company sj has waived the id requirements for traveling via trains and they want the immigration services to tell the refugees about this . 
  salaries too high ? 
  yeah , right . 
  true , i 'm not being serious . 
  the foil hat conspiracy theorist in me would n't be surprised if russia just seeks to prolong the flow of refugees from the region . 
  looks like i 'm working remote on friday . 
  how are we supposed to know that the entries represent political parties ? 
  over here we just have this : http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article7938465.ece/alternates/w580/lks%2019.4.2015%20%c3%84%c3%a4nestyslappu%20eduskuntavaalit, 
  she is an ice hockey commentator in sweden ? 
  did you just say `` hi aussie '' in finnish ? 
  his arguments and un and imf statistics against your word ? 
  yes , thank you . 
  the refugee crisis is a non-issue . 
  the increased budget for handling refugees is only 150 million . 
  this whole tax is about balancing the tax hikes so that wage earners and their unions are content . 
  only less than 10 % in finland earn more than 60 000 euros per year , so the solidarity tax does n't affect many . 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/govt_unveils_final_budget_proposal_includes_tax_increases_for_the_well-to-do/8297260 edit : i mean , event the police union has hinted about a strike , along with many many others . 
  some workers have already protested by walking out of their workplaces . 
  this is all about appeasing them . 
  we just had parliamentary elections this year . 
  the prime minister and the ruling parties now rule as they see fit with the mandate they got . 
  all these things were expected imo . 
  we use d'hondt method if you want to take a look at how the actual system works . 
  ... to cover refugee costs ? 
  what an out of context and cherry picked title . 
  the so called solidarity tax is a symbolic gesture , and its aimed at appeasing the finnish public . 
  not because we 're having money problems due to refugees . 
  it 's because the state 's budget has gone to shit , this has nothing to do with refugees . 
  better weather 2 . 
  weed 3 . 
  seemingly more laid back culture ( i do n't really know :d ) 4 . 
  less lutefisk, 
  majority of people are good citizens . 
  otherwise the world would be ran by criminals and mobsters . 
  i hope you 're not trying to dismiss hans rosling just because he thinks more immigration is good . 
  big coalitions rarely work . 
  last government in finland was a coalition of six parties , it could n't get anything done . 
  now the government consists of the three largest parties , the finns being one . 
  i 'm guessing somewhere down the line , sd and other parties will form a coalition government . 
  the coalition partners will keep each other 's in check so that they do n't get to do the most extreme stuff they want . 
  democracy with a proper electoral system i might say . 
  probably not in the long term . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xynpjgamixo tl ; dw : do n't trust media to give you an accurate view of the world . 
  that i do agree with . 
  well , my issue with / u/laslpalp was the `` welfare shopping economic migrant '' term . 
  a lot of people do just that , they move from country to country in search of a better life . 
  i see nothing inherently wrong with that . 
  why does it matter ? 
  usually in the demographically ageing countries immigration is better in the long run anyway . 
  you could integrate most of the people in less than 20 years probably . 
  and besides , if the eu wide refugee distribution system is established , they 'll get them anyway . 
  edit : dumbfucks of / r/europe , the downvote button is n't a `` i disagree but i wo n't tell you why '' button . 
  of course not . 
  it 's pronounced `` nis\u00e4k\u00e4s '' :p, 
  no , union means that in order to satisfy the expression you have to belong to either one of the groups . 
  so not and , but or . 
  well , if there was a civil war in finland , i 'd be fucking terrified of people who go house to house and murder the able-bodied men so that they ca n't pick up arms . 
  no , they are n't . 
  well fuck me . 
  that does n't say anything about immigration though . 
  no it is n't . 
  `` miekkailija '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywfdikqqc-a, 
  sure , but the schengen agreement does allow heightened border control in special circumstances ( like now ) . 
  that 's a cottage , not a day . 
  i 've heard of some stories about sami councils ( not the sami parliament ) that do n't work objectively when working out different kinds of family feuds . 
  i can imagine the sweden democrats clinging to things like that . 
  the geography of belgium is vastly different compared to finland . 
  over here terrain greatly favours us . 
  i 'll start : learn to fly for fuck 's sake and stop probing our response . 
  and so the money flows . 
  like blood in the circulatory system . 
  ** in your face sweden , wooooooooooo !, 
  underrated ? 
  if you like ales , bitters or esb 's , uk is * the * place to search for them . 
  uks ales are shining bastions of light among the darkness of the ipa fad ( seriously , in finland pretty much 90 % of craft beers are ipas ... ) . 
  they ? 
  saying that the 16th century finns considered themselves swedish is stretching the facts quite a bit . 
  edit : 16th century ... not grimmdark 1600th century, 
  nobody is saying otherwise . 
  only hell if you live in kuusankoski , 
  orange is `` oranssi '' in finnish . 
  a six month period of having a leg band + minute schedule sounds pretty lax when everyone else has to do 6-12 months of service . 
  i 'd be lying if i said that i did n't hate it at times . 
  it sucked a lot during the bleak winter nights when you 're running in the woods with a millimeter paper , a 6000 mil compass ( k\u00e4sisuuntakeh\u00e4 ) while other team members drag a 50 meter wire through the mud and rain . 
  naturally you 're freezing your fingers off and your clothes ( and ass ) are wet . 
  then you finish the exercise and the sergeant tells you `` uniform mike '' ( uusiks meni - again ) and you just feel a little bit more dead inside . 
  though it was nice to spot artillery targets . 
  the resulting explosions usually made up for the cold and wet feeling  but overall ... 
  i 'd say it was a good experience . 
  something completely different from normal life . 
  no , not really . 
  100 x 100 meters is tiny , houses in rural areas usually have lots that size . 
  you would n't marry a 30ish year old woman if you were closing in on 60 if you could ?
