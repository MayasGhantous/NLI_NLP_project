  some of your sidewalks are narrow as hell though . 
  i remember walking by tivoli and the actual walking path was like 1 meter wide , and i was constantly stepping on the bicycle path with my luggage . 
  android emulation is rather poor . 
  it 's not possible to run any background tasks without keeping the app open in a screen ( i guess this prevents the emulator from stopping ) , nor do push notifications work . 
  it suffers from the chicken-egg problem . 
  no apps for it because people do n't use it . 
  people wo n't buy it because there are no apps for it . 
  also it 's very very rough . 
  my gf has a jolla and the phone managed to corrupt its own file system under completely normal usage . 
  no way to recover it , had to send it to repair and they completely wiped all data . 
  if we 're talking in the context of history , sure . 
  then it 's true . 
  i suggest you stop talking out of your ass and study what the climate is like in finland . 
  no , but the industrialization and urbanization that begun in the 19th century has n't stopped . 
  it 's still very much alive and fighting it seems futile to me . 
  you do n't pay much attention to news , do you ? 
  dare i say that finnish university students have made new words for the song and it 's a pretty common drinking song ? 
  it 's a catchy song , at least our version :d, 
  they could at least try ... 
  `` national '' costumes . 
  no i do n't . 
  it was just a reference to the civilization games . 
  united states of america has won the cultural victory !, 
  first i was like `` wtf , finns party is on the list '' , but then i noticed the text colour codes . 
  that might be , but the article is about sweden . 
  no , i do n't have kids so i suppose my viewpoint is more neutral on the matter . 
  and i like optimism , otherwise everything is just shit ( learned that in the finnish defence forces ... ) edit : by `` neutral '' i did n't mean that i know any better . 
  i 'm just indifferent on the issue . 
  well no , i have n't studied in sweden at all . 
  i 'm more familiar with the finnish schooling system  my reasoning with mixing the students up , is that that way big cliques would n't necessarily form based on whether you 're an immigrant or not . 
  if you had only an handful of immigrants in a school and rest were natives , the immigrants would practically be forced to be more in touch with the natives and thus there would be less chance of a strong clique to form . 
  maybe that 's just wishful thinking , i do n't know . 
  as you said , i do n't know the swedish situation that well . 
  i 'm not saying they see it as some opportunity , i 'm saying it provides them a way to reflect upon their own study methods and overall behaviour . 
  so what do you suggest ? 
  why should n't they try to intermingle the students so that the immigrant students would see how the `` normal '' swede acts and studies in school . 
  that seems like a great way to integrate people and make them better students . 
  otherwise you 'll just get enclaves of poorly performing schools full of poorly performing students . 
  that 's the way it works in finland usually . 
  the municipality tells you that your child goes to school x , though you can usually influence the decision . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure so someone correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  good students in bad schools are n't wasting their time and potential in the nordic countries , as our teachers are all pretty highly educated ( master level ) and competent and the curriculum is state wide . 
  cut the brits some slack , that 's the only sun they have . 
  what 's your point ? 
  this is what some of the major political parties have mentioned in their party programs : economic downturn and lack of medium sized companies effectively means that our economy is n't agile enough to adapt to quickly changing markets . 
  nokia mobile division is a great example of that . 
  a big mammoth corporation that has so much momentum behind it that changing the course of action took too long . 
  also the gigantic public sector is being used as a reason also . 
  some call for outsourcing services to private companies , while some do n't like the idea . 
  no , it definitely does n't mean that . 
  the finnish name is `` perussuomalaiset '' , which translates directly to `` basic finns '' . 
  the finnish name itself does n't sound nationalistic at all in my opinion , more like that they stand up to the average finnish man . 
  yea , i 'm an nco so my rehearsals were basically about how to train the grunts . 
  not anymore . 
  they changed their english name to match the finnish name better , i think . 
  karpr artillery regiment . 
  it was cut in 2009 for five years ( you know , the market crisis and all that ) . 
  it 's now back to normal levels . 
  i had my first rehearsal two months ago and i was 2/08 in the army . 
  if you 've ever been to reserve refreshment rehearsals , you can ask the officers there for your war time unit . 
  the letter tells you nothing extra . 
  what a weird article . 
  first two paragraphs on point , and then it somehow turns into completely unrelated stuff . 
  it was the final simulated combat exercise ( brigade level stuff , big operation ) during my one year stay in the finnish defence forces . 
  i was the nco of a forward observation patrol , that consisted of four men . 
  we were usually attached to other units during the exercises . 
  after one mission we , two patrols ( eight men ) , were outside our company 's hq , taking a knee , and i noticed that the nco of the other patrol team was playing with the fire selector of his rifle as if it was a guitar string . 
  i asked him `` i hope your rifle is n't loaded '' , to which he responded `` nooooo , it is n't loaded '' . 
  at that moment , i noticed his finger moving towards the trigger . 
  i immediately put fingers in my ear because i knew what kind of an idiot that guy was ... ** blam ** . 
  the other guy is in shock of what happened , the brigade general comes out from our company hq along with our sergeant ( who was our trainer ) and the company commander ( a captain ) . 
  sergeant immediately starts shouting '' ** what the actual fuck was that , voi vittujen kev\u00c4t mit\u00c4 vittua ei saatana ! ** '' . 
  the other nco was still in complete disbelief of what happened , looking at his rifle . 
  two other guys ' ears started ringing and others were annoyed as fuck . 
  i thankfully , due to my experiences with the dumbass , did n't suffer from anything since i had stuck my index fingers into my ears . 
  more like `` antagonize finland so that kremlin can use that as cannon fodder for their putin-bot army '' . 
  i disagree . 
  i want to know how much i should eat less if i drink a few beers on some day . 
  i do n't know about you , but i personally would n't want to get fat . 
  translation : `` jantunen also does n't comment on whether is it a suspected submarine or not '' . 
  maybe it 's just lost in the translation , but the official statement says that they do n't have any specific types of suspected objects . 
  ** it has n't been said whether the target is a submarine or not ** . 
  the title is misleading . 
  no idea . 
  i suppose it 's a way to guarantee at least some spending money if you 're extremely poor . 
  110 km/h with a pv ? 
  sounds scary as fuck . 
  as i said , i do n't blame someone else if i make a choice to break the law and get fined because of it . 
  i 've only gotten a parking ticket . 
  parked on a sand field that did n't have marked parking spaces . 
  me and 10 other car owners received fines . 
  i think it was 50 euros or so . 
  the guy who received the fine is a millionaire and lives in a mansion . 
  he earned 7 million euros the previous year , 56 000 euros is less than a percent of that . 
  the person is complaining about a minuscule amount of money to him . 
  he speeds way , way above the limit and then somehow manages to think that finland is a hostile country to rich people . 
  delusional i say . 
  only valid point the guy has , is that the jump from a normal ticket to a day fine is pretty drastic . 
  we do n't have mega rich people , wealth is comparatively evenly distributed . 
  we do n't have gated communities or anything stereotypically rich people things .
