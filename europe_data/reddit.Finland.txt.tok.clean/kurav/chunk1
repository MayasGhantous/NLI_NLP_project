yup , so far you were allowed to advertise only mild alcohols ( in effect , beer and cider ) . 
  but from beginning of 2015 that will change too , and any alcohol advertising whatsoever is banned . 
  however , i understand there is still a loophole where breweries that can afford it ( i.e. 
  the large ones ) can make a similar non-alcoholic beer to their `` real '' product , and advertise that instead . 
  though there still remains the question how google returning results for the event with the keyword `` whisky '' , private enthusiasts writing about the event or the event having the word `` whisky '' in its name can possibly be considered advertising by the govt . 
  officials . 
  ** finland ** * media * * the top story ( at least on-line ) has been the '' ** [ whisky gate ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/hs_finnish_officials_ban_the_word_whisky_on_private_blog/7523995 ) ** '' . 
  govt . 
  agency tasked with alcohol serving licenses gave the permit to the [ 2014 helsinki beer and whisky expo ] ( http://olutexpo.fi/?kieli=en ) only on the condition that search engines must not link to the event when users use the keyword `` whisky '' . 
  the agency further instructed that the fair must drop the word `` whisky '' from its name -- becoming just `` beer expo '' -- or the organizers would be denied alcohol permit . 
  two ** private bloggers ** also [ had to remove ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/officials_deny_general_whisky_banbut_whisky_fair_cant_call_itself_that/7524224 ) any references to the word `` whisky '' from their posts about the upcoming event . 
  the agency 's demands are based on the total ban on advertising spirits . 
  it is not yet known what the festival will be called in 2015 , when advertising beer will too be forbidden . 
  * [ a parliamentary committee proposed ] ( http://torrentfreak.com/finland-wants-to-kill-crowdsourced-copyright-law-141009/ ) voting down the ** citizens ' initiative copyright law ** , that would have legalised private downloading . 
  reasons include `` incompatibility with existing legislation '' . 
  * economy * * two journalists published an in-depth book about the ** [ fall of nokia ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/08/nokia-stephen-elop-operation-new-book ) ** at the hands of ** stephen elop ** . 
  after interviewing more than 100 people -- including the company 's top management at the time -- they essentially conclude that elop was a * really * lousy ceo and a spectacular failure , but all insiders agree that he was not a '' ** trojan horse ** '' . 
  * standard & poor 's [ cut our credit rating ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/s-p-cuts-finlands-credit-rating-one-notch-to-aa-plus-1412965531 ) from the best possible aaa to aa + , with stable outlook . 
  this was expected , given that the country 's economy is stalling , as the [ latest data ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/80000_industrial_jobs_disappeared_over_five_years_new_figures_show/7522434 ) again shows . 
  * crime * * three people are suspected of ** [ murder with terrorist intent ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/court_puts_three_terror_suspects_behind_bars/7521754 ) ** , and put behind bars . 
  details so far unclear , as is normal with on-going criminal investigations . 
  * police warned that a ** violent gang of teenagers ** operating in the helsinki area have [ robbed and battered ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/helsinki_police_struggle_to_rein_in_youth_gang/7515333 ) several of their peers during the summer . 
  other reports suggest the gang is mostly made up of immigrants . 
  * politics * * swedish pm saying his country would recognize the ** state of palestine ** was widely reported in the finnish media . 
  finland often follows suit , [ but not this time ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/president_niinisto_finland_wont_recognise_palestine_supports_two-state_solution/7514274 ) . 
  nice try , officer . 
  my experience is that there are roughly three categories of graffiti painters : real artists , high school kids and compulsive vandals . 
  the real artists generally prefer to do their graffiti in legal or semi-legal setting , and those are the skilful pieces you see every now and then . 
  they mostly have a stable job , often in graphic design or other creative field where they can professionally employ their artistic skill . 
  high school kids are just rebelling children bend on doing something illegal/forbidden , and often combine the defacing of public property with general vandalism like breaking windows etc. 
  their `` art '' is most often very primitive , such as writing `` tags '' on a wall . 
  great majority of the high school kids eventually grow up , but a small minority remain bitter to the society to their ( physical ) adulthood , and continue their vandalism despite the legal and social consequences , making them what can be called compulsive vandals . 
  they usually have other social and personal problems , like substance abuse and social exclusion , are rarely able to hold a permanent job and must go painting every night to satisfy their `` addiction '' . 
  their art remains primitive like with the high school kids , although some might see some artistic development , however nothing that would make them true artists . 
  this guy clearly belongs to the compulsive vandal category : despite spending a total of 8 years in prison he continued his `` campaign '' against public property at a great expense to the taxpayer . 
  his `` art '' is very primitive , and as he told in the interview he had to go painting every night . 
  ** finland ** * a bizarre episode came to a conclusion when a tavastian businessman missed the final deadline of a payment to the municipal government for a plot of land he had intended to buy for his new car business . 
  his planned business came to be the focus of intense media reports after he earlier this year [ confidently boasted to have secured $ 30 million in financing ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/final_deadline_looms_for_mega_car_showroom_project/7499414 ) from the widow of the ex-president of zambia . 
  despite the intervention and warnings of the finnish equivalent of the f.b.i. , the businessman insisted on paying $ 300 000 in advance fees to a `` middle man '' . 
  probably needless to say for anyone who has ever used the internet more than once , the $ 30 million [ never materialised ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/sunny_car_cash_yet_to_materialise/7501193 ) , and some con artist in africa instead got an extra vacation . 
  * [ parliament to propose more funding for the military ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/more_funding_for_the_military/7498506 ) . 
  * a veteran mp of the green party announced that he would [ not run for re-election ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/veteran_mp_finnish_leaders_have_lost_ability_to_make_decisions/7510617 ) , saying he 's had it with the country 's political system and especially the current cabinet , which he called the worst ever . 
  [ fixed link ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/aladdin_%28choklad%29 ) , photo of the [ box ] ( http://www.scandinavianstuff.com/shop/11328/art28/h4096/14354096-origpic-de7c05.jpg ) ( yes , they 're a really popular christmas chocolate here in finland too , and yes , this is * very disturbing news * indeed . ), 
   cars of czech members of parliament can not be towed away by police for wrong parking . 
  mps voted a special exemption for themselves . 
  that 's pretty absurd stuff . 
  takes balls even for an mp to place yourself so blatantly and openly above the law . 
  ** finland ** early week : * the leading ncp party elected a new chairman last weekend , with the winner bound to become the next prime minister . 
  early week news cycle [ was largely dominated ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/katainen_exits_pms_post_government_reconstitution_talks_begin/7300719 ) by [ the cabinet negotions ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/party_leaders_reach_agreement_on_new_government_programme/7311678 ) between the pm designate [ alexander stubb ] ( https://twitter.com/alexstubb ) and the other cabinet parties , mostly sdp which is headed by another fresh chairman , [ antti rinne ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/rinne_new_government_programme_fulfils_sdp_objectives/7311719 ) . 
  the outgoing pm jyrki katainen will become an [ eu commissioner ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/katainen_takes_over_as_interim_commissioner/7306068 ) . 
  * [ helsinki is the world 's 5th best city to live ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/helsinki_ranked_5th_best_city_to_live_in_new_york_and_london_out/7300638 ) * [ trade with germany surpasses trade with russia ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/russia_no_longer_finlands_largest_export_partner/7300848 ) * [ several ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/trial_begins_of_alleged_12m_euro_drugs_ring/7302068 ) large [ drug trials ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/appeal_court_extends_deadline_for_charges_against_ex-drug_chief/7311295 ) move on , with the other one involving a corrupt police drug chief . 
  * it was revealed that back in 2007 nokia [ had paid millions of euros ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/nokia-paid-millions-of-euros-in-ransom/3448918 ) to an insider extortionist to protect secret smartphone codes . 
  part of the sum was donated to charity , as per demands by the criminal , who has never been caught . 
  thursday -- sunday : * finland was [ literally closed ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/midsummer_reminder/7309623 ) this week from thursday on due to the midsummer celebrations , with [ almost everyone leaving the cities for the countryside ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/midsummer_traffic_at_its_peak/7311600 ) . 
  sorry , if you tried to visit . 
  * the weather during the mid * summer * celebrations this year was unfortunately cold and rainy , including [ hailstorms all around ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finland_shivers_through_midsummer_holiday/7312690 ) . 
  on the flipside , [ only one person drowned ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/quiet_midsummer_for_rescuersone_drowning_reported/7312862 ) , a record low of over 40 years . 
  * williams f1 driver valtteri bottas defended his pole position [ for third place in the austrian gp ] ( http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/114593 ) against the almost unbeatable mercedes drivers . 
  the race was won by nico rosberg , the son of finnish f1 legend keke rosberg . 
  in finland , i eye the largest newspaper daily , and i know there 's an upcoming election , but sadly there 's hardly been any coverage about what 's at stake in the election , what are the different party platforms or even what euro parliament groups they represent . 
  they did the usual `` election machine '' , where the candidates get a free word and answer a few pre-selected questions , and you get to see how well your answers match up with theirs . 
  but with little actual reporting about these topics , it 's all quite lame . 
  the biggest euro election news was already months ago , when the poster-boy image conservative party minister and `` finland 's most active tweeter '' ( i am not making this up ) announced his candidacy . 
  sadly , it almost feels like the euro parliament is an overseas camp for celebrity politicians , where they go for a tour of doing random `` euro-stuff '' for a few years , then maybe return later to domestic politics with an `` i was in strasbourg '' t-shirt . 
  no one really seems to know - or care - what they actually do as meps . 
  or that volcano . . eyjafa . . jeku . . ah , never mind !, 
  but did the journalist who exposed them have to pay compensation ? 
  ** finland ** * the conservative party prime minister announced late last week that he would resign in the summer and seek a high-ranking position in the eu . 
  early this week there was [ much speculation ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/who_will_replace_katainen_four_favourites_stand_out/7176545 ) about his successor . 
  later in the week , the outgoing pm recommended that finland , with sweden , [ should join nato ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/pm_finland_should_embrace_open_international_integration_and_consider_nato_membership/7187948 ) `` when the time is right '' . 
  * our ambassador to russia commented on twitter that a helsinki-based english-language news site 's reporting of finnish relations with russia was inaccurate . 
  the site responded by threatening to sue the ambassador . 
  reporters found [ multiple ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnbays_english-language_news_reporting_under_scrutiny/7177044 ) [ red flags ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/foreign_ministry_puts_finnbay_on_ice/7179895 ) with the news site , like faked contact info , which lead some to speculate that the site might even be a deliberate psychological warfare operation by a foreign government . 
  this was however [ later ruled out by the security service ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/mfa_meets_finnbay_founder_does_not_suspect_russian_involvement/7185449 ) ( supo ) . 
  * a researcher who invented modern high-density hard drives and spearheaded the cloud computing era [ was announced as the recipient ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/09/stuart-parkin-millennium-technology-prize-cloud-computing ) of the biannual millennium technology prize , awarded by the technology academy finland . 
  * bj\u00f6rn wahlroos , a multi-billionaire banker , the chairman of the boards of two of the country 's largest banks , [ moved home to sweden ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/banking_tycoon_wahlroos_quits_finland/7182953 ) for tax reasons . 
  * the postal service ( itella ) is to [ release stamps ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/itella_to_release_tom_of_finland_stamps/7188557 ) featuring art by [ tom of finland ] ( http://tomoffinlandfoundation.org/foundation/n_home.html ) , an internationally known artist who drew of homoerotic themes . 
  `` finnish citizens '' according to police . 
  so probably ethnic finns , but not certainly . 
   because the people does not understand this , politicians constantly cut funding from our defense good noticing . 
  the point of this whole rhetoric is probably to get more funding for the defense forces ( finland too has been cutting defense spending ) . 
   kevin magnussen took home third place ( later upgraded to second place after a disqualification ) in his first formula 1 grand prix . 
  national pride knows no bounds . 
  happy to see more nordics in f1 . 
  looks like magnussen and mclaren might have a bright future ahead of them . 
  kind of reminds me of both h\u00e4kkinen and r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 's entry to f1 , as they both too started to prosper only in ron dennis ' team . 
  though neither of those guys were ever able to take a podium in their whole first season -- let alone in their * first race ever * , like magnussen just did . 
  ** finland ** : * the situation in ukraine has again brought the topic of the country 's membership in nato on the table . 
  finland has so far maintained a policy of military non-alliance , but the events of the last few weeks have probably dealt blows to arguments against joining nato . 
  yet , [ politicians remain reserved ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/katainen_finland_is_not_neutral_nato_is_an_option/7139523 ) , at least until public opinion shifts to favour nato membership . 
  * on a brighter note , spring came early this year . 
  temperatures reached +10 c all across the southern parts of the country during the week -- pretty unusual for march -- but then fell back to around zero [ for a really lousy weekend weather ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/snow_and_sleet_make_for_hazardous_driving/7138659 ) . 
  * economy is bad and analysts forecast [ gdp will hardly grow this year at all ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/nordea_finlands_economy_will_hardly_grow_at_all_this_year/7133255 ) . 
  * two people have been arrested for planning a bomb attack against the university of helsinki , the country 's oldest and largest university . 
  [ exact details remain largely confidential ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/university_officials_weigh_security_risks/7138449 ) due to ongoing investigation . 
  * absurd story of the week : a group of four men , disguised in full hard-hat worker gear and apparently heavily intoxicated , walked into a pub in helsinki . 
  the group proceeded to wreak havoc in the pub 's wc by drilling holes to the floor with a leased large jackhammer , until the staff noticed something was off . 
  [ one was arrested ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288665400548.html ) , but was unable to answer what had driven the group to this action . 
  eu is not a defence union . 
  the eu members admit that , and most organise their defence through membership in nato .
