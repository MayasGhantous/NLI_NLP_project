  my fav : idiom : `` juosten kustu '' literal translation : like pissed while running meaning : something made very sloppily and in hurry -- as if someone had urinated while running , instead of stopping at the side of the road and taking the time to relief himself in the normal manner . 
  ( the new nokia phone is again like pissed while running ! ), 
  or `` quit beating the dead horse '' . 
   not surprising that that 's not the way it 's seen in finland but that is how it 's seen in sweden . 
  well , i do n't remember what was taught at school , but any finn with a basic understanding of the country 's history would likely concur with what you wrote . 
  the only important difference in finnish historical writing is that when referring to sweden before the 19th century , many use the term of `` sweden-finland '' , because it 's important to remember that sweden then also encompassed the present-day finland . 
  many laymen however tend to forget that finnish nationalism was n't really born before the 19th century . 
  they like to think that finns were first `` oppressed '' by swedes and then russians , while actually the oppression did n't start until 19th century under imperial russia as a reaction to our nationalist movement . 
  it 's not fair to compare sverigedemokraterna ( sweden democrats ) to perussuomalaiset ( sannfinl\u00e4ndarna / true finns ) . 
  although the parties current policies , aims and methods are quite similar , sweden democrats -- unlike true finns -- bears the burden of formerly having people affiliated with neo-nazism in its high ranks . 
  true finns -- on the other hand -- have always drawn a strong distinction from nazism , and enjoy a much wider popular support . 
  my opinion is that this is thanks to their more successful appeal to traditional social democratic values , while strongly disassociating from anti-democratic movements like nazism . 
  while sweden democrats have definitely tried the same , their stand has probably not been as credible thanks to the historical burden .

  in crime ( as [ reported ] ( http://www.poliisi.fi/poliisi/etela-savo/home.nsf/pfbd/58119a0e5f4372c1c2257bef00472f5c/ ) by the police ) : on the night between sunday and monday , a male broke into a summer house in parikkala , taking assorted property from the residence . 
  the man loaded the stolen goods on a ridable lawn mower , and rode some 10 km in the dark of the night to kes\u00e4lahti . 
  there , after running out of fuel , he broke into another summer house , where he again stole property -- including a gardening tractor with a trailer , on which he loaded the stolen goods from this house . 
  he also took the family 's blueberries he found in the summer house 's freezer . 
  riding away with this combination of vehicles , the suspect started to feel tired and fell asleep in his mode of transport at the side of the road . 
  passers-by notified the police , and the sleeping male was apprehended . 
  the man has admitted his deeds in questioning . 
  the stolen goods were mostly recovered , except for the blueberries that the man ate for himself .

  thank you , what an interesting read . 
  while in lithuania i only tried the high-volume commercial varieties like different types of svyturys . 
  fascinating that there is even much , much more to lithuanian beer . 
  as for the law of not selling beer after 10pm , i was thinking it has to be something new because when i was in lithuania a few years back , i think we were able to buy beer late into the night from the supermarkets . 
  wikitravel has it the law came into effect only in 2009 . 
  i find it regrettable if other northern european countries are following the anti-beer hysteria prevalent in scandinavia . 
  in finland the hysteria has done terrible damage to our beer culture , although it has recently been in recovery . 
  yet , planned new legislation ( not allowing beer stronger than 3.5 % to be sold in markets ) might still prove devastating for the small breweries . 
  btw i would still think kvass is a special type of beer , but i guess it 's ultimately just a matter of taste and opinion . 
  well , kvass is a type of beer to my mind anyway . 
  i recognized the 1 litre plastic beer bottle that i learned are very popular and ubiquitous in the baltics while bike-traveling there . 
  i love how people in the baltics still have respect for their beer , as it 's the best refreshment after a long day of biking . 
  in my country , it 's illegal to sell beer after 9pm except in bars , the common beers are of terribly low quality , and in the popular opinion beer is demonised as a `` nasty '' and `` forbidden '' drink .

  that stephen elop , ex-ceo of nokia , was a `` mole '' sent by microsoft to purposely sabotage nokia 's smartphone operations in preparation of an eventual takeover . 
  background : before joining nokia as ceo elop worked as an executive at microsoft . 
  after two years as nokia 's ceo , the company had lost 80 % of its market value . 
  during elop 's time , nokia kept making really stupid choices that made no sense business-wise or technologically . 
  after microsoft bought nokia 's phone unit elop want back to work at microsoft ( since fired ) . 
  eh , the refrain `` l\u012bgo , l\u012bgo '' eerily remainnds me of this finnish folk song : [ v\u00e4rttin\u00e4 - liigua ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daumv7fdpgw ) . 
  but in this case , `` liigua '' apparently means `` handsome man '' .

  baltic sea is the world 's most polluted sea . 
  the water is quite dark , and anything that spends much any time submerged in its murky waters starts to look quite old quite fast .

  the submission has the bbc article 's original title . 
  by now the title at bbc has been editorialised to `` obama admits us gun laws are his ` biggest frustration ' '' . 
  * you * have to prove ? 
  sounds like assuming someone guilty until proven innocent . 
   berlusconi [ ... ] economy minister post nice , so we wo n't be needing the sanctions anymore soon , 
  i agree , but i understand the bbc is financed through a tv license . 
  that is archaic , as it makes no sense in the modern times - almost everyone anyway consumes public broadcaster content via tv , radio or online . 
  many people will try to evade the fee and then get really annoyed at the inspectors , and the enforcement also costs money . 
  finland moved to a mandatory public broadcaster tax a few years back , the size of which depends on your total income , and i think it 's working pretty well so far . 
  the tax is paid along with your normal income tax . 
  no more license evaders and everyone contributes . 
  stubb is very pro-eu , probably the most pro-eu guy in the parliament , so there 's no use telling him otherwise . 
  but his party has less eu-enthusiastic guys as well . 
  i 'm sure if our local ukip starts polling close to 30 % ( currently at 18 % ) , you wo n't see him as a cabinet minister anymore . 
  it was mainly the american board members representing american stockholders who insisted on elop . 
  i only wish the joke was on them alone . . 
  we hope to pay our debt one day . 
  my house in helsinki still has signs forbidding beating carpets on the balcony , and i think it 's in the house rules as well . 
  as late as in the 1960s the kennedy administration were [ seriously concerned ] ( http://m.nautil.us/issue/23/dominoes/how-the-computer-got-its-revenge-on-the-soviet-union ) that the rapidly progressing computerization ( then called `` cybernetics '' ) of the soviet economy would lead to tremendous advances in productivity ( the actual effect of computerization on soviet economy was closer to * diminished * productivity . ),

  you can still order those coin bags with finnish 1c & 2c coins [ here ] ( http://www.suomenrahapaja.fi/eng/kerailyrahapussi-2015/18078/dp ) . 
  the fin 1c & 2c coins are legal tender , but all shops round cash transactions to the closest 0.05 $ and smaller coins than 5c are not circulated , but a small amount is minted each year just for coin collectors ' interest . 
  the guardian endorsed libdem in the previous election , but given how they managed to completely backtrack on their pledge [ not to raise tuition ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-students-being-put-off-voting-for-lib-dems-over-tuition-fees-uturn-10188327.html ) , i guess they switched to labour instead . 
  i do n't think you want to accept payments on large scale from eu customers without having an office here . 
  i think the main thing that sucks here is your grammar . 
   as an example my daughter was shot in the face by this monster that sentence means that you are using an example , the example being that your daughter was murdered -- a thing you are saying really happened . 
  in english , you must indicate hypothetical scenarios with grammatical constructs such as :  as an example let us assume my daughter was shot in the face by this monster  as an example if my daughter was shot in the face by this monster  as an example would my daughter have been shot in the face by this monster, 
   i did n't state this as an example of what happened to me no , you claimed that your daughter was a victim of this crime and went on a dramatic tirade about the surrounding circumstances . 
  the rest of your comment bases on an assumption that because i refuse to believe your daughter was killed by breivik i am one of those `` euro-folks '' who have no consideration for the victims of terrorist attacks and think a rightful punishment for terrorism is a slap on the wrist and some rehabilitation . 
  nice trolling , but please go do it somewhere else . 
   as an example my daughter was shot in the face by this monster i call bs . 
  from your comment history it 's clearly obvious that you are american , not norwegian . 
  moreover , publicly proclaiming ` your loss ' and foaming for street justice does not strike me as someone trying to come in terms with the the loss of a close one .

   what specific law ? 
  this judgement is based on the court 's interpretation of ehcr article three , which prohibits inhumane punishment . 
  what this exactly means is set by case law . 
  i think swedish income tax caps at about 55 % , but it 's progressive so most pay less . 
  why would you not tax stock options like normal income ? 
  it closes a heap of ways for gaming the system . 
  is this some kind of a stupid joke ? 
   they cited an expensive housing market , an environment that makes it difficult to offer stock options to workers and a lack of emphasis on teaching coding in the education system . 
  let 's take a moment to dissect that . .  expensive housing market welcome to silicon valley , where 1-bedroom apartment rents on average at $ 3096 / month , ^ [ 1 ] ( https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-san-francisco-rent-trends/ ) about triple that of stockholm . ^ [ 2 ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=sweden&amp;city=stockholm ) i am not saying stockholm is not expensive , but it 's still a far cry from sf or ny . 
   environment that makes it difficult to offer stock options to workers not sure how is that possible . 
  some tax issue ? 
  pretty sure a company is free to offer its stock as it pleases . 
   lack of emphasis on teaching coding in the education system generally scandinavian countries are far higher educated than the us . 
  i am willing to bet my ass that sweden produces more computer science / it graduates per capita than the us .
