  to me this sounds like a douche it millionaire who happened to strike really lucky bitching about relatively minor issues just so he can trip about his high social status and make `` threats '' to a whole nation . 
  disgusting and sad . 
  i am not saying it 's the * same * , just that it reminds me of it . 
  thank god , war against terrorism is not fought like wwii . 
  but certainly brussels could be doing more to stop the spread terrorist ideology . 
  building what essentially seems like a ghetto for immigrants is probably the worst thing one can do . 
   but nazi forces did not advance via `` ideology '' , they used tanks and shit . 
  the largest factor of fascist success was manipulating relatively large populations to side with their cause . 
  again , i see no difference to islamist extremism . 
  but you are right that war against terrorism is not fought , lost or won like wwii -- it 'd be absurd to expect isis to drive tanks down champs-elysees -- now or in future . 
  but if we really have areas of europe where 90 % of highschoolers admire terrorists , then we are certainly loosing against isis , and can expect more terrorist attacks in future . 
  likewise , if we end up sodomising our democratic liberties or eu thanks to ( protectionism fueled by fear of ) terrorism , it 's again a win for the terrorists . 
  why is no one speaking of how to defuse molenbeek ? 
  at least this article paints a picture that nobody is doing anything about it and nobody cares . 
  if brussels would for example started building new housing projects for immigrants in less homogenic parts of the city to advance integration i would call it a victory against terrorism . 
  i was only comparing the isis ideology to nazi ideology . 
  of course every person drafted to their ranks is still a personal tragedy . 
  note however that isis does not operate only among european immigrants , but rather poses a quite a similar threat in the areas where it can operate freely as nazis did in europe in the 1930s -- [ genocides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_of_yazidis_by_isil ) and all . 
  well isis and more broadly islamist fundamentalism is not ideologically far removed from the type of fascism we had in europe in the 1930s . 
  both want to subject everyone to an authoritarian leader ( the f\u00fchrer / the caliph ) . 
  both want to enforce their moralistic principles on everyone . 
  both hate democracy and glorify war . 
  both believe in a mythology that non-adherents find objectionable ( nazi occultism / extremist interpretation of the quran ) . 
  both believe in the superiority of their own race ( `` aryans '' / arabs ) over others ( jews , europeans ) . 
  you could draw even more parallels . 
  so this is why it reminds me of wwii : belgium being again seemingly overrun by fascism while everyone sits by powerless . 
  sadly , this reminds me of wwii . 
  belgium , france and the netherlands stood no chance against the advancing nazi german forces . 
  in the linked article , it seems the authorities can clearly identify the problem but seem lost regarding how to defuse it . 
  it might be that they are witholding the british relevations until tomorrow 's bbc panorama broadcast . 
  remember that this is a coordinated disclosure across multiple media organisations , and there 's a large cache of news to be released , so they reveal it in iterations like with earlier leaks . 
  main site is down , but at least bbc and s\u00fcddeutscher attribute it to an `` unknown '' source . 
  what do you base that on ? 
  the face of `` my career is over '' . 
  in the video it looks like he was caught absolutely pants-down and reacts with what resembles panic . 
  how is taking a picture of your house from the street an invasion of privacy ? 
  i am all for people 's privacy being respected , but fail to see how the facade of one 's house can fall within privacy . 
  actually , the public facade is more like the * opposite * of private . 
  where do you draw the line between private and public ? 
  certainly not * everything * can be private . . 
  what part is exactly missing from the recording ? 
  at least in finland moving apartments is valid grounds of cancelling the fixed-term subscription without having to pay any penalty fees . 
  whoa , this sounds really interesting . 
  but why is it then illegal to share the business class isp connection with your neighbours ? 
  in romania or anywhere else for that matter ? 
  first reaction when seeing these pictures : google [ `` hiking in georgia '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=hiking+in+georgia ) . 
  probably the first time doing a google search * added * to my confusion . 
  this would be so weird in finland . 
  finns have no concept of small talk , so it would be kind of rude to answer that with anything but a full disclosure of your latest goings , and ask the driver for the same . 
  since at this point you 've spent a good minute hearing each other out , you 'd need to wait for a silent moment to know the conversation has run its natural course , and then try to end it with some ` deep ' philosophical note like `` that 's how life is ... '' before you could ever get onboard . 
  the busses would run hours late of the schedule and the modern society as we know it would eventually collapse . 
  in some pictures you can even see artifacts of this special color photography method . 
  for example [ this one ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cxmzt#12 ) has interesting `` rainbow '' in the ripples of water since the river flowed ever so slightly between capturing each color . 
  it 's not just the european countries . 
  nato ( + non-aligned europe ) , russia , israel , the kurds and iraq all [ share a common enemy ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/14/natos-turn-to-attack-paris-terrorist-isis/ ) in isis . 
  the total military power of such coalition would well exceed half of all military power on earth . 
   individuals in saudi arabia are funding isis . 
  you are right , but as i understand it the saudi government is not doing the best it can to curtail the funding . 
  quoting the link you gave :  there is support for isis in saudi arabia , and the group directly targets saudis with fundraising campaigns , so riyadh [ government of saudi arabia ] could do much more to limit private funding . 
  to be frank , it 's pretty useless to make a distinction between the government and individuals living under that government 's jurisdiction , when the government is not doing the best it can to stop supporting terrorism . 
  contrast with taliban afghanistan before 9/11 : the eventual reason us attacked them was not doing enough to bring osama bin-laden and other al-qaeda leaders to justice , even if the government was not supporting terrorism directly . 
  though i think the parliament is pretty undivided in that right now is * not * the time to cut in defence . 
  pensions they dare not touch because the pensioners are a really major voter group thanks to the population `` pyramid '' that looks more like an icecream cone -- the same as in most of eu . 
  after sauna , you can easily `` chill out '' in -10 c outside temperatures for up to ten minutes , wearing only an optional towel . 
  at some point it starts to get a bit cold to the feet . 
  then you just gulp the last of your beer and head back to the warmth of the sauna . 
  the few luxuries of proper winter . . : sigh :, 
  both in ireland and spain the housing market collapsed around the same time as the us sub-prime bubble burst . 
  where it 's happening next is anyone 's guess . 
  massive sudden fall in house prices due to previous overvaluation . 
  usually comes with respective increase in personal bankruptcies as people default their mortgages . 
  voting for 3rd party in us is counterproductive as long as they do n't fix the archaic election system . 
  same goes for uk . 
  erdogan has directly supported isis from the beginning and knows that undeniable evidence of this will surface sooner or later in this time and age of information . 
  he is currently in the process of consolidating his power so he can not be ousted even when his allies turn their backs on him . 
  vanjoki also [ said ] ( http://m.taloussanomat.fi/it-viikko/2007/01/11/nokian-vanjoki-tervetuloa-kisaan-apple/2007744/133 ) that iphone was a `` welcome competitor '' but `` lacked crucial features like 3g support '' . 
  further telling how they only focused on the bill of hw features but failed to see how the sw was way outperforming their offering . 
  it actually got pretty acceptable after they ported qt to symbian . 
  but that was not even fully finished before they decided to can it all and go with win-blows phone . 
  sevastopol in ukraine is not recognized internationally as part of russia . 
  the second map is the more interesting one . 
  russia is a federation , like us and switzerland , but unlike them it is not divided to just states/cantons but to republics , okrugs , oblasts , krais and two federal cities ( st. petersburg and moscow ) . 
  all of these federal subdivisions have their local parliaments and governors . 
  the republics are ( at least on paper ) most autonomous , each with their own constitution . 
  okrugs are ethnically largely not-russian and also supposedly more autonomous than oblasts ( but less so than republics ) . 
  at the dissolution of the su there were ten federal okrugs , but only four remain due to being subjected to bordering oblasts and krais . 
  as i understand it , oblasts are more like provinces , with less local autonomy . 
  krais ( russian for `` frontier '' ) are judicially same as oblasts but located at ( some historical ) borderlands . 
  then , there are the two federal cities , much like the german federal cities of berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  russia also claims sevastopol in crimea as a federal city . 
  and finally , there is the sole autonomous oblast , the jewish autonomous oblast in far east . 
  established under stalin 's ethnic policies it is though nowadays only jewish in name . 
  ** tl ; dr ** russia is one complex federation . 
  yeah , their song does n't sound too unlike sweden last year either . . 
  it 's funny how the term `` liberal '' alone has almost opposite meaning in the us and eu . 
  the american usage actually dates from the time of the new deal , a welfare state programme ( i.e. 
  leftist ) . 
  the proponents of the new deal were called `` liberal '' and its opponents `` conservative '' . 
  so to caricature , in the us a liberal wants to raise taxes and enact welfare programmes , while in the eu that 's * exactly * what a liberal would oppose . 
  norway is nowadays in the single market .
