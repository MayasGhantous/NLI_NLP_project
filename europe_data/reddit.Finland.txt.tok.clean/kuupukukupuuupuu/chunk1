... and now she 's literally hitler , let 's throw another violent threat at her . 
  do n't you guys see what you 're doing ? 
  just read [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5c7cks/yes_president_marine_le_pen_is_now_more_possible/d9ubwjt/ ) , he/she says it much better than i could . 
  i do n't know anything about marine le pen 's ideology , but this is this exact kind of arrogance that brought trump 's victory . 
  every joke about killing her gets her more votes . 
  now i 'm going to google what marine le pen has said with a tiny bit sympathetic attitude towards her . 
  not that it matters what a single finn thinks , but ridiculing the opponent is always shooting yourself in your own foot . 
  `` let 's antagonize the opponent , that 'll shut them down instead of making them vote harder '', 
  [ 2254 forms of kauppa , shop ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) yes , that 's over two thousand forms for each noun . 
  it 's `` ime munaa '' ( suck [ imperative ] dick [ partitive ] ) , not `` ime\u00e4 ( to suck [ basic form ] munaa [ partitive ] ) if you want use it as an insult . 
  `` ime\u00e4 munaa '' would be almost like suggesting a conversation topic , the dick sucking in general . 
  easy for you to say , you 're in an eastern european country that 's in nato . 
  let 's point out how different languages have different letters , so original ... 
  imagine if every comment written in english would have some dumb-ass finn saying `` hahaha bcfqwxz vat a veirt langvits '' because we do n't have any of those letters in native finnish words .

  heh , i wonder what the portuguese would think of -51 c , the lowest temperature we 've had . 
  +25 c is bordering heat wave temperatures in finland . 
  once the maximum temperature of day reaches +27 c finnish officials give a `` hellevaroitus '' , heat wave warning . 
  people are adviced to avoid long exposure to extreme heat , avoid physical stress and drink lots of liquid during such extreme temperatures . 
  the finnish warning system goes as far as `` extremely uncomfortable heat wave '' : max . 
  +35 c and min . 
  +20 c so +35 c at night would be a total nationwide panic here if that ever happened . 
  in comparison , finnish meteorological considers the ' +20 to +35 c ' day as extreme and unusual as -45 c temperatures . 
  [ source ] ( http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/aarilampotilojen-terveysvaikutuksia ) edit : i got ta ask , were you serious when you said people wear winter coats at +25 c temperatures instead of sweating their balls off in t-shirt and shorts ? 
  because it sounds like a joke finnish people might say at southern europeans . 
  you ... you 've never seen anyone cross-country skiing ? 
  that 's like asking how to ride a bicycle on flat surface . 
  some finnish sayings : `` kiivet\u00e4 perse eell\u00e4 puuhun '' = to climb a tree with your arse first = doing things the hard way `` naama kuin petolinnut perse '' = face like a bird of prey 's arse = ugly `` pime\u00e4\u00e4 kuin m\u00f6r\u00f6n perseess\u00e4 '' = dark like in the boogeyman 's arse = dark `` kuin perseeseen ammuttu karhu '' = like a bear who has been shot in the arse = really angry `` persaukinen '' = open-arsed = poor ( ca n't buy new trousers ) `` olla kyrp\u00e4 otsassa '' = to have a dick in your forehead = to be angry `` py\u00f6rii kuin hullun mulkku mielett\u00f6m\u00e4n perseess\u00e4 '' = rotates/rolls around like the dick of a crazy person in the arse of the insane one = moves around too much , wo n't stay still `` py\u00f6rii kuin puolukka pillussa '' = rotates like a lingonberry in a pussy = see previous saying `` se on tuurissaan kelle suuri mulkku syntyy '' = it 's about luck who is born with a large dick = it 's down to luck , we ca n't do anything about it `` ei tullut lasta eik\u00e4 paskaa '' = neither a child or a shit came out of it = no results ( despite the hard work ), 
   no pasta detected . 
  are you sure you were in italy ? 
  that weirded me out too . 
  the dinner was just a giant steak with olive oil . 
  no pasta , potatoes ( like we would have had ) , rice , salad or anything to go with the steak . 
  the whole concept of eating potatoes as a part of dinner confused them ( `` no , we do n't eat pringles with food ... '' )  so you eat bread for most of the day ? 
  that sounds like prison , bread and water :d what do you mean i have a boring diet ? 
  lapua ( finland ) has a [ bear-riding , club-swinging dude ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua#/media/file:lapua.vaakuna.svg ) , your argument is invalid . 
  yes , 17 or 18 is a weird time for dinner because * it 's * * too * * late * . 
  i have visited italy and the absolutely insane eating habits of you were pure torture to me . 
  my italian host family did n't eat anything for breakfast ( and offered me kiddie breakfast like muffins instead of fulfilling like rye bread , porridge or even m\u00fcsli ) , the `` lunch '' at 12.00 was stuff that we call a snack . 
  then practically nothing until a huge-ass steak at 21.00 when normal people do n't eat anything heavy anymore . 
  it 's been 10 years and i 'm still angry about it , it was like prison ( except that i 'd honestly pick finnish prison food over italian normal food with those dinner schedules ) . 
  the dinner schedule in italy was literally worse than in army camp in winter lapland during food supply malfunction ( not a hyperbole ) . 
  here 's how normal people eat : -7.30 : hearty breakfast ( coffee , rye bread and porridge ) -11.30 : lunch -16.00 : dinner -18.00 : snack ( rye bread , fruits etc. ), 
  -21.00 : evening snack aka . 
  so you 'd want a slight advantage on those rare occasions where you travel abroad at the cost of having a huge inconvenience of messed up times all day every day ? 
  people have had the `` 12.00 is mid day , 00.00 is midnight '' system for hundreds of years , i really do n't see why we should change that . 
  why would you eat anything heavy after 17 ? 
  while kenya is n't exactly in europe , i think we could make an exception this time and add kenya 's [ harambee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kenya ) somewhere . 
  i was working at a brewery ( olvi ) where this guy was talking about going to estonia to buy the exact same beer that was being brewed for thousands of liters all around us . 
  i 've heard several linguists proposing a groundbreaking theory that [ the bird is the word ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aprtfxd9u9y ), 
  there 's a fine line between being drunk enough to talk to the opposite gender and not passing out . 
  hundreds of comments and nobody has mentioned d ** ou ** lingo in the title ? 
  meh , i dislike like 90 % of sweet foods . 
  basically everything sugary except fruits and chocolate is a no-no for me . 
  i have no idea what those are so i 'm going to play it safe and put pineapple and ketchup into them . 
  jam and cream where ? 
  i knew a kid who put ketchup in every lunch in school . 
  i mean everything , including fish soup where the ketchup kind of floated . 
  s\u00d6meb\u00d6dy once told me, 
  sauli also dated [ tanja karpela . 
  \u00d6sterreich is it\u00e4valta in finnish , we too respect your superior umlauts . 
  some of them \u0151s and \u00f4s are good letters i suppose . 
  no , that 's a japanese puzzle . 
  the word you 're looking for is subaru . 
  `` dem damn niggermen coming to our country shouting ~ ~ ablablablr ~ ~ \u00f6\u00f6\u00f6e\u00f6e\u00f6\u00f6 from dem mosques '' was another gem from teuvo . 
  are you sure it 's eighteen years in `` 7 \u00a7 '' of sexual laws ? 
  it looks a lot like `` kahtatoista vuotta '' , `` twelve years '' to me . 
  yep , i instantly go `` is finland better then sweden '' before having any idea what we 're even comparing . 
  can confirm . 
  though estonian beats us with quadruple vowels in words like j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r . 
  with all the old sayings we actually have about russia ( `` a russian is a russian even if you bake it in butter [ sugarcoat it ] '' and `` you do n't wake up the sleeping bear '' ) , it 's kind of sad to see this out-dated bush joke as the 2nd most upvoted comment . 
  we finns have livable wage , education , housing and health access to nearly everybody . 
  he 's tired of hearing about trump in a thread about finland that has nothing to do with american politics . 
  dem 's fighting words . 
  i do n't think it 's about region , just the guy in the host family seemed really shallow and impolite , not trying even a single dish we tried to offer him when he visited us in finland . 
  he was more of a party-party guy eating fast food , he had probably never heard of those traditional dishes you mentioned . 
  what ? 
  when i told that my average meal had pork/cow/other meat and potatoes ( normal boiled potatoes ) they went quiet and asked `` you mean like pringles after ? '', 
  i dislike pringles very much and i have no idea why people pay so much for ruined potatoes . 
  you can buy like the shittiest , cheapest finnish potato chips and they 're a lot better than pringles . 
  i would n't buy pringles if they were on -90 % sale . 
  in the year of 20xx , a super president named megatrump was created . 
  dr. bannon created megatrump to stop the evil desires of dr. clinton . 
  when i visited italy the whole concept of eating potatoes as a part of a dish was foreign to them . 
  they literally asked `` you mean like eating pringles after meal '' ? 
  my initial reaction too was `` 100 kilos of kellog 's rice crispies ??? 
  '' , but [ cereal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cereal ) is a wide term which means anything made out of wheat , rye , rice , corn etc. 
  mind reading the edit ? 
  which i added 2 hours after your comment ... 
  reminds me of the squash seed pack which had the name in 7 languages : squash squash squash squash squash squash kes\u00c4kurpitsa, 
  no they did n't . 
  edit : okay then . 
  nobody uses `` simppeli '' seriously . 
  the closest english equivalent would be saying `` totes '' instead of totally . 
  [ `` most other countries call ... '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/brnymhgh.jpg ), 
  yeah , i was just talking about dominos ( pizza in america , cookies in finland ) and messed up the links . 
  oops , wrong picture . 
  it should be a picture of a satyr instead of cookies now . 
  hahah what the hell :d i meant to add [ this ] ( http://orig01.deviantart.net/4eaa/f/2009/296/a/4/satyr_for_paizo_publishing_by_michaeljaecks.jpg ) picture of satyr , no clue what happened there . 
  last week i was eating macaroni ( spaghetti is too expensive at 1.6 / kg ) , cheapest discount meatballs ( 50 % meat and meat-like-substance ) , ketchup , peas and pineapple slices .
