  i looked at my dish and thought `` i bet this would trigger some italians '' . 
  satirical * satyrical means looking like [ satyr ] ( http://orig01.deviantart.net/4eaa/f/2009/296/a/4/satyr_for_paizo_publishing_by_michaeljaecks.jpg ) , a beast man from fairy tales . 
  edit : link was messed up, 
  if pineapple on pizza is wrong then i do n't want to be right . 
  i like [ dominos ] ( http://www.paperipalvelu.fi/filemanager/html/productimages/large/520211.jpg ) as much as the next guy we 're talking about pizza here . 
  kebab , pineapple , chicken and blue cheese is the correct answer here . 
   am i the only one that thinks this word for word copying of trump memes and applying them , word for word , to schultz is some of the most cringe worthy stuff i 've ever seen ? 
  sad !, 
  how is really good finnish trout related to anti-gay laws ? 
  that 's funk of the gods , right ? 
  it took some effort to find a photo that was * without * johaug ( tumblr links are banned here ) since johaug does n't look like a frankenstein 's monster and it would have been confusing to use the picture with both of them . 
  [ natural beauty ] ( http://e.lansik.pl/la317/36ede443001715de4f10119c ) ( not johaug but she 's from the same team ), 
  i guess that guy starts every conversation with `` kyss mig i reva perkeleen rich fucks ! '', 
  so he 's bound to find some `` racism '' . 
  i 'd like to point out that op 's name , `` thissit '' , sounds like a lisping or excited finnish man saying `` tissit '' , `` boobies '' . 
  i prounounce every damn letter here in / r/europe ( that 's eu-ro-pe , not yurop ) as it should be done . 
  [ `` here 's a secret about silent letters , they 're unnecessary '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4lq6ohiscg ) * raises * * talikko *, 
  illanois sounds like a rapper name , sir ill-a-noise, 
  heyguyshowsitgoing kripparian here . 
  today i want to answer a simple question : how good is washington d.c. ? 
  as it turns out it 's preeeeeeetttttyyyy goooooooood . 
  then again , the jab at denmark was so lame ( nuh uh , you 're stupid ! ), 
  that it shows how inexperienced we 're at making fun of denmark . 
  four if you count `` getting naked and sitting on anthill '' a sport . 
  well the host is jukka * lindstr\u00f6m * , which sounds a little suspicious to me . 
  peaceful protests for democracy , big-ass sausages , my respect for romania is growing each day . 
  obligatory `` but conservative parties are against gay marriage which is exactly the same level of oppression as saying homosexuality is a sin punishable by death !, 
  words hurt just as much as actual violence '' disclaimer : i 'm pro-gay marriage and i 'd prefer conservative parties agreeing with me , but that 's not going to happen . 
  i think i 've had macaroni , sausage and mustard once . 
  it was kind of bad but it was cheap and easy . 
  it was all fun and games until  you shall forever envy the british food * sobs * * in * * the * * corner *, 
  i have no idea what this rant about appalachian meth , eastern european bbq and cardamon seeds means but just for you i checked my soy sauce bottle and it said `` to be used for marinading , seasoning and `` p\u00f6yt\u00e4mauste '' ( table seasoning , the stuff you add to food after it 's cooked , like ketchup ) . 
  i think i 'll trust the official text on the bottle instead of random redditor . 
  besides nobody mixes soup cubes into butter ... 
  i do n't think i 've used butter ( not margarine ) for over 10 years , it 's unhealthy and it tastes bad . 
  `` raw ketchup '' , you guys crack me up . 
  what 's next , raw salt , raw pepper , raw sriracha ? 
  i know putting ketchup on pizza is kind of uncultured , but if you ca n't put ketchup on pasta then what are you supposed to do with it ? 
  ketchup on spaghetti or macaroni is the pretty much the essential pasta buddy , it 's like potatoes and butter or rice and soy sauce . 
  kookkaammuuttaan = `` for its sizeableness '' paakkuuntumattomuuttaan = `` for its un-clump-able-ness '' , as in `` suosin t\u00e4t\u00e4 lettutaikinaa paakkuuntumattomuuttaan '' i prefer this pancakemixture for it 's unclumpableness '' ( though you 'd probably say `` because it does n't get clumps '' but what 's the point of using several words when you can be more efficient ? ), 
  liikkeess\u00e4\u00e4n = `` in his/hers business '' but honestly , i do n't get what 's forgettable about double letters . 
  the difference between double and single letters is crucial and they 're pronounced completely differently . 
  for example : min\u00e4 tap ** aa ** n sinut viidelt\u00e4 = i will meet you at five o'clock min\u00e4 tap ** a ** n sinut viidelt\u00e4 = i will kill you at five o'clock or taka = behind - takaa = from behind takka = fireplace takkaa = fireplace ( partitive ) taakka = burden taakkaa = burden ( partitive ) or muta = mud mutaa = some mud mutta = but muuta = move in !, 
  ( command ) muutta = without moo ( like a empty cowhouse ) muuttaa = to move in, 
  america does n't have cheese slicers ? 
  wow . 
  yes , because you saw a movie where it was snowing in sweden and that must mean it 's a country of eternal winter . 
  why would you go to norway to buy booze when it 's a lot cheaper in finland , sweden , denmark , estonia , every other country in europe , every other country in world etc. 
  asking for any person - let alone the president of usa - to be assassinated is n't a `` non-issue '' . 
  as a finn where everything is rounded just like that i can confirm this . 
  finland does n't use 1 or 2 cent coins . 
  if you pay in cash the numbers are rounded to closest 5 or 10 cents , but if you pay with a card you 'll pay the exact price . 
  here 's one amazing trick !, 
  economists hate me !, 
  if you buy something that costs 0.87 $ with cash and 0.88 $ with card the first one gets rounded down but the second one does n't get rounded up . 
  you 'll save dozens of cents every month !, 
  i was going to reply `` it 's just a redditor butchering the original title , there 's no way ... '' but you 're right , the article actually says eradicating smokers , not smoking . 
  i bought a liquorice candy pipe once and now i 'm terrified . 
  despite the thumbnail picture , finland is n't actually going to eradicate smokers by killing them all . 
  in the year of 20xx a super president named megatrump was created . 
  maggot cheese is the only actually disgusting food here . 
  the idea of worms digging through the cheese that will soon continue digging through your brain ... 
  compound word is a single word , now matter how you twist these terms . 
  `` just because finnish combines it into one word instead of two does n't make it a different word . '', 
  `` h\u00f6tt\u00f6 lumi '' would make no sense in finnish since h\u00f6tt\u00f6 can not be translated as `` fluffy '' as the word does not exist outside compound words . 
  it 's more like fluffsnow if you could n't use the word fluff on it 's own . 
  do you think nightstick ( or night stick , as it does n't matter in english as it matters in finnish ) is n't a word with unique meaning ? 
  that it means the same as `` night , stick ! '', 
  goldfish is n't an actual word that has different meaning that words gold and fish together in some other sentence ? 
  no offence but you have a ridiculous conceptions about compound words if you think they are not actual words that carry their unique meanings . 
  i 'll give you another example : `` iso is\u00e4 '' means ( physically ) large father , `` isois\u00e4 '' means grandfather . 
  there 's a huge difference between a father who is large and a grandfather . 
  `` mummon lihapullat '' means grandmother 's meatballs , `` mummonlihapullat '' means meatballs made out of grandmother 's flesh . 
  altering the same words with suffixes ( koira and koirasta , dog and dog-from are indeed the same word ) is not at all the same as compound words . 
  explain me how ajolumi ( dry snow carried by winds ) , hanki ( hardened snow cover ) , huove/h \u00f6ty ( snow that has become porous because of mild weather ) , hy\u00f6ty / hitva/hile ( small snow crystals ) , loska ( really wet snow , almost water ( but notice how snow is the first defining word , not water ) ) , etc. 
  are not words describing snow when all of those describe snow and snow alone . 
  i made it roughly halfway through the wikipedia list and got 8 terms that can only mean snow even in the strictest definition and the last time i checked 8  3 . 
  i 'll even remove the single compound word , ajolumi ( literally meaning drivingsnow so there 's no way to understand what it means unless the compound word has established a commonly accepted single meaning ) even though it makes no sense and i 'm still at 7 . 
  okay , if all languages have the same amount of snow/ice related words then tell me 2 greek terms for `` snow that has become porous because of mild weather '' ( huove/h \u00f6ty ) . 
  [ here 's a wikipedia article that lists 28 finnish words that mean snow and snow alone ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/luettelo_lunta_tarkoittavista_suomen_kielen_sanoista ) , none of those are `` different words for semi-related weather precipitations '' since i only counted the first section . 
  but surely you know my native language better than i do . 
  edit : actually the number of purely snow-describing words on that site alone is a lot higher than 28 since the word riite alone has the synonyms of riide , riitta , riitto , kerte , kohma , kahma and hyyde because of finnish dialects and nuances between the terms . 
  edit 2 : here 's another list of 50 finnish words for snow : auhtalumi -- auhtolumi -- hauhtalumi -- hauhtolumi -- haverinsiite -- huotarinsiide -- huotarinterva -- h\u00e4rm\u00e4 -- h\u00f6hh\u00f6lumi - h\u00f6hk\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6h\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6mylumi -- h\u00f6ntylumi -- h\u00f6pp\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6pp\u00f6slumi -- h\u00f6ssel\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6ss\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6sylumi -- h\u00f6s\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6tel\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6tter\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6ttilumi -- h\u00f6ttyr\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6tt\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6tt\u00f6slumi -- h\u00f6tylumi -- h\u00f6t\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6yhk\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6yhtyv\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6yht\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6yht\u00f6lumi -- h\u00f6yrylumi -- h\u00f6yr\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6ytel\u00f6 -- h\u00f6yttyr\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6ytylumi -- h\u00f6ytyv\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6yt\u00e4kk\u00e4 -- h\u00f6yt\u00e4lumi -- h\u00f6yt\u00f6lumi -- iisakinsiite -- kiitele -- kiituma -- kiituva -- kitilumi -- kitkalumi -- kitkutus -- kitulumi -- kiuranne -- kylm\u00e4nkide -- kytylumi -- kyvenlumi -- nattura -- n\u00f6ht\u00e4lumi -- n\u00f6yht\u00e4lumi -- pakkasenhiutu -- pakkasenkauna -- pakkasenkiide -- pakkasenkiitu -- pakkasenkitu -- pakkasenkiuhtu -- pakkasenkiukku -- pakkasenkiven -- pakkasenkuura -- pakkasenkyven -- pakkasenlumi -- pakkasenruoka -- pakkasensiemen -- pakkasensilo -- pakkasensyd\u00e4n -- pakkasensy\u00f6tti -- pakkasens\u00e4en -- pakkasenvihat -- pakkasenvihoitus -- pakkasenviti -- pakkasviti -- sarvenkaapitus -- sarvenkaapotin -- sarvenkaape -- sarvenkaappu -- sarvenkaapu -- sarvenkaaputus -- sarvenkaavitsu -- sarvenkaavitus -- sarvenkoputus -- sarvenkraappu -- sarvenkraapute -- sarvenkraaputus -- sarvennuuha -- sarvijauho -- uppura -- utu -- utukka -- vikilumi -- vitilumi to be honest i do n't know all of these very traditional and old-fashioned words but i 'd say at least the majority of them is purely snow-related and the rest of them is snow in borderline ice or water form . 
  i 'm a little late but yeah , it 's a sentence `` moonsuit dome is missing/lacking '' . 
  it should be kuupukukupu_uupuu but that does n't sound nearly as confusing . 
  if only reddit allowed longer usernames so i could be ravaavavaraavaavaravaaravaraaravaraani ( `` galloping recharging backup parrot lizard of spacious fells '' without some '' _ `` s ) . 
  my finnish friend who lives in germany is terrified by the lack of winter tires there . 
  for all the stereotypes about german car knowledge and playing everything safe , it 's really surprising you guys do n't use studded tires or even friction tires . 
  we had 23 celsius degree shift ( from -24 c to -1 c ) within 22 hours in oulu , finland last month . 
  from the top of my head i can think of lumi , nuoska , viti , loska , kuura , huurre , j\u00e4\u00e4 , hanki , kohva , rautaj\u00e4\u00e4 , polanne , puuterilumi , rae ... 
  i 've heard finnish ( or at least finns speaking german ) sounds like austrians . 
  `` i am stroke [ partitive ] '' is an interesting thing to google translate . 
  or did you mean `` saan aivohalvauksen '' , i 'm having a stroke ( literally `` i get/receive a brainparalysis '' ) ? 
  i 'm amazed how you have a perfectly written aivohalvauksen in a sentence with 2 letters that are n't even remotely finnish . 
  i see you 've played tableknifey tableyspooney before . 
  the eagle has landed . 
  i repeat , the eagle has landed . 
  what is kladkakka ? 
  all i know is that kakka means poop in finnish .
