  and the ads being obtrusive does not give you the right to view content you did n't pay for it it 's meant to be paid for . 
  it 's pretty common on certain finnish websites . 
  news websites particularly . 
  i 've ran into stuff like that on some local usa news sites too . 
  what i 'm getting at here is that the people making the ads and the people serving them need to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves why people are blocking them . 
  blocking people using ad-block is n't going to solve the problem , especially when such a restriction is trivial to get around . 
  the loss of revenue is also questionable , especially if the site uses click , lead or action based ads . 
  i 'm never going to click an ad even if i see one . 
  so they would n't get paid for my visit anyway . 
   except adblockers came into existence when ads were n't that obtrusive . 
  theirs is a response to us , not the other way around , though it may seem so . 
  we had pop-up ads come to be ( around 1999 or so was when it got really bad if memory serves me correct ) , we got pop-up blockers as a response . 
  they were so annoying major browsers integrated the blocking into their product . 
  then we got hover-ads and from there on it has been a game of one-upmanship from the ad makers and people who hate the annoying things they came up with . 
  the popularity of ad-block did n't come around until ads were hovering over content you were seeking out , blocking it , playing annoying sounds and animations and what have you . 
  in their desire to get noticed the ad makers drove their intended audience to actively block them . 
  i 'm sorry , ethical or not , but at this point ads are a security risk and blocking them is a valid course of action . 
  there have been [ several ] ( http://www.pcworld.com/article/2086700/yahoo-malvertising-attack-linked-to-larger-malware-scheme.html ) [ cases ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6537511/google-ad-network-exposed-millions-of-computers-to-malware ) of legit ad-networks serving people viruses/malware on major websites . 
  that 's on top of ads slowing down websites , sometimes completely preventing the site from loading because some ad-network server is down , ads popping up on top of content , auto-playing videos and sounds and a bunch of other obnoxious stuff . 
  not to mention the tracking they do that no one has given them consent for . 
  the ad industry has screwed itself over and it 's them and their clients that need to change . 
  ad-block is simply the consumer protecting themselves from their overreach . 
  eu is ~ 510 million people with the uk . 
  uk is ~ 64 million people . 
  ~ 446 million people in the eu without the uk . 
  i 'd imagine it takes time to research the case and then push it forward . 
  the tax issue is also something that has gotten more attention in recent years so it could also be a matter of where resources have been allocated in the past . 
  they 've also been pushing other similar cases such as starbucks in the netherlands and fiat finance and trade in luxembourg . 
  perhaps they 've gone after smaller targets to build precedents and now they 're hitting the big guys . 
  the advertisers and websites have only themselves to blame for the mess . 
  if they 'd been content with a simple banner and text ads most people would n't bother with blocking them . 
  but they did n't . 
  they had to push it . 
  pop-ups , pop-unders , automatically playing video ads , ads that cover the entire page , ads that slide in from the side when you 're halfway through the article , compromised ad servers that serve malware to users , slow ad servers that prevent the actual content from loading and a host of other things that have contributed to people hating ads . 
  not all of these are an issue today , but they contributed to the process at some point in time . 
  was there an internet before ads ? 
  yes . 
  will there be an internet if ads are gone ? 
  yes . 
  will it be as commercial ? 
  maybe not . 
  is that a bad thing ? 
  probably not . 
  i pay ~ 35 euros per month for 100mbit/s cable . 
  it also comes with a 4g connection that goes up to 40mbit/s . 
  i could get 1000mbit/s for ~ 60 euros per month . 
  that 's the prices from one of the three big operators in finland . 
  the others do n't really differ that much in price though availability might limit your options . 
   we really should find a cheaper and tougher replacement of asphalt . 
  the answer is , of course , solar freaking roadways !, 
  well , there are [ rumours ] ( http://www.knowyourmobile.com/mobile-phones/nokia-c1/23369/nokia-c1-leaks-running-android-windows-10-ahead-q4-2016-launch-a1 ) nokia is getting back into the phone business in some capacity . 
  maybe it 'll go well this time . 
  wikileaks seems to be under quite a bit of attack because of the dnc emails they 've published . 
  anything from `` it 's putin doing it ! '', 
  to ddosing their servers to writing articles like this . 
  seems to be a standard thing though . 
  wikileaks publishes something , someone goes `` but you 're putting people in danger !, 
  think of the cia operatives ! '', 
  various finnish stuff in finnish .

  he seems to be saying the uk will negotiate trade deals while brexit negotiations are going on , but from what i 've read in the past , is that not against eu treaties ? 
  as long as they 're eu members the power to negotiate trade deals lies with the eu , not the uk ? 
  bbc seems to say that 's the letter of the treaties , but who knows what 's going to happen officially . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36684876 sovereign countries are free to ignore such things , of course , but i 'd imagine some in the eu might have issues with that which could affect things on the brexit table . 
  in any case it does n't seem like it 's as simple as `` we can just go negotiate deals '' . 
  they have n't as far as i 'm aware . 
  so let me try to explain this for the foreigners . 
  the official m\u00f6lkky games are made by a company that uses unemployed people as their main work force . 
  they get long term unemployed people who the ministry of labour has deemed in need of rehabilitation because they 've been out of work so long . 
  it 's supposed to be a way for them to get back into the workforce . 
  if the unemployed refuse to take this `` offered '' opportunity they will lose their unemployment benefits for a set period of time so they 're essentially forced to take it . 
  what the company does it simply rotates these people in and out , never hiring anyone . 
  the unemployed get their usual unemployment benefits and an extra 9 euros per day while they do a full days work assembling these games . 
  that 's pretty much all paid for by the state , not the company . 
  meanwhile the company sells the games and makes millions in profit and why not ? 
  they 're not really paying anything to the people making the product . 
  it 's frankly sickening that it 's allowed to go on . 
  even if you wanted out of the eu , why would you want to vote now or in the next year or two ? 
  that 's what i do n't get . 
  if you 're in that leave camp now is the time to sit and watch what happens with the uk . 
  if everything goes well for them you 're in a much stronger position to push for an exit vote . 
  if things go badly for the uk then you 've avoided getting your country in the same mess . 
  a few years more in the eu for that information is a tiny price no matter how you look at it . 
  there have been numerous leaks regarding ttip and its content over its lifetime . 
  those are what have gotten people worried and uncomfortable . 
  i doubt anyone has much against making trade easier with usa . 
  it 's a question of under what terms it is done . 
  ttip does n't seem to have the terms people are comfortable with . 
  jean-claude van juncker , the man who will once again bridge the uk and eu together with his amazing split . 
   also note that not only is the # already recovering , but ftse has already returned to pre-brexit levels . 
  so much for the uk financial apocalypse , and it has only been a week since voting . 
  the uk has n't even started negotiating to leave yet . 
  in essence , very little has changed for now and after an initial panic we 're comfortably in a waiting pattern . 
  if you really believe this was it then , i 'm sorry to say , you 're seriously deluding yourself . 
  when the uk does start to negotiate and the terms for leaving become clear you can expect the markets to react and that will be when the `` apocalypse '' hits if the terms are n't good for the uk . 
   there 's no point in pressuring them to trigger art . 
  50 , it 's clearly exclusively the uk 's choice . 
  i 'd say there 's a huge economic and political incentive for the rest of the eu to get the ball rolling as soon as possible . 
  this uncertainty we have now is good for no one . 
  the sooner there are official negotiations and we start seeing nuggets of actual agreement dropping the sooner things will stabilize .
