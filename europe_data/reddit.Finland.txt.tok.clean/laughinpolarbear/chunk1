it must 've seemed like a good idea for the rest of the nordics , leaving norway with just the coast and mountains . 
  then oil happened ... 
  or how about a peaceful referendum for the people who live at the peak of the halti mountain ? 
  there 's a finnish hermit that has reportedly been living there since last week . 
  still raises questions : how did the doctor not notice a [ huge sign saying ` doping ' on the cream ] ( https://twitter.com/mrasmussen1974/status/786506246664753152 ) ? 
  how much cream did she use on her lips for it to show in such amounts in her blood ? 
  how do the norwegian doctors make so many mistakes in such a short time , first giving asthma meds to skiers without asthma and now giving steroid cream to johaug ? 
  why do these explanations arise , not when they 're noticed but whenever norwegian skiers are caught in the tests ? 
  it 's a real shame if this was an accident . 
  the rulebook still says that even if there 's a good explanation given , it 's 2 years ban at minimum . 
  well , there 's a finnish feminist and former head of an art university , who publicly said finland alone ( with a population under 5.5 mil ) could take a million refugees . 
  she now lives in sweden , because she did not like the `` political climate '' and `` attitudes '' here . 
  believe it or not , she 's somehow a professor without even a basic understanding of math or economics . 
  i mean , why would you watch porn anyway ? 
  finding a woman in real life is so easy when you 're socially skilled , good looking , fit , young , tall , funny , not disabled and have a nice stable income . 
  in finland , i feel like the negative attitude is mostly towards islam or people mistaken to be muslim . 
  in fact , if there 's a white finnish woman dressed like a muslim , i feel like there might even be more backlash and negative attitudes than if they were mid-eastern or somali . 
  would be interested to hear how often e.g. 
  east-asians in finland face racism , since to me it seems like there 's barely any . 
  lets give norway \u00c5land islands , just to piss off sweden . 
  or , even better , lets give some of the islands for denmark as well . 
  [ so so evil ... ] ( http://i.makeagif.com/media/7-11-2015/rjqfei.gif ), 
  my mom says i have a good visual memory http://i.imgur.com/zwc6qbz.jpg, 
  next up : turkey to temporarily suspend elections for ... the next 1000 years, 
  some europeans still seem to live in their own idealistic bubble despite increasing terrorism in europe as well . 
  israel is dealing with areas where 67 % of the population supports stabbing jewish civilians to death . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/623 ), 
  outraged at western leaders supporting erdogan . 
  i wonder if they 've seen pictures of soldiers , anti-akp protestors that have been executed or beaten up by islamist erdogan supporters . 
  supporters who erdogan pretty much commanded to go in the streets to beat people up . 
  outraged at western leaders supporting erdogan . 
  i would show you pictures of what the akp/erdogan supporters are doing to soldiers and secular turks right now , but i do n't think that kind of material is allowed here . 
  they 're literally executing them in isis like fashion . 
  erdogan is now calling for death penalty to be revived which pretty much meangs there will mass executions of pro-coup army members , seculars and human rights activists in turkey soon . 
  if the erdogan supporters are going outside , i hope those against them are as well . 
  turkey you must succeed in this or else you 're looking at a civil war . 
  now , now ... sexism against men does n't count because they already have their male privilege . 
  lets look at facts : [ sweden is # 4 in gender equality , finland is # 3 . 
  ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/67020/gender-equality-around-the-world-the-best-and-worst-countries ) oh sweden , if only you would put your men in jail for refusing military service , maybe you could take our # 3 spot . 
  meanwhile in finland , [ nearly 90 percent approve their president and only 1 % disapprove . 
  alright , my fellow finns ... whose basement is it ? 
  this is not good for our relations . 
  how about this : every person has 1 vote by default . 
  additionally there is a voluntary test where each voter can gain extra votes . 
  more points one gains in the test , more votes they can give . 
  this way the system would still be democratic and everyone would contribute to the decisions , but it would give more weight for intelligent , informed and well researched opinion . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence that nordic countries known for being the most feminist countries also top the list of [ `` most violent countries for women '' ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/3/5/1394023651567/682ffce9-36ed-4205-b93b-844894f4620b-620x571.png?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8ab3048ed4fe20e14eed206be4ed33e ) . 
  nordic women are more likely to report and report smaller things than other european women . 
  there 's many systems in place for reporting these things , except that they 're almost exclusively for women , despite men experiencing more physical violence ( usually from other men ) and half of domestic abuse victims being male . 
  pft ... 
  i say we would be a lot better off without all these leftist `` experts '' , `` economists '' and `` scientists '' . 
  i mean have they ever had a real job ? 
  i do n't even understand how as much as a third of finns want out of eu ( although some are so dumb they probably confused ` eu ' with ` eurozone ' ) . 
  finland has such a small population that we will always be `` bossed around '' by bigger entities to some extent . 
  if we leave the eu , that entitity will become russia . 
  just like it has always been during our entire independence before the eu . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization surprized `` true finns '' / `` the finns '' are still relevant , even though they 're literally a textbook example of populism , making a 180 degree turn in their positions as soon as they got in the current government . 
  that citizens initiative was made by a former big brother contestant ( not even kidding ) who is now apparently the leading figure of the partys youth movement . 
  not exactly the kind of cv that makes him an expert in economics . 
  plot twist : atlantis is future britain, 
  `` moooslems out '' ? 
  at the moment it looks like scotland/n . ireland , maybe london will declare independence , stay in eu and the rest of britain will be bought by saudis and renamed islamic state of england and wales . 
  scotland should 've been drawn cutting itself off and the british flag replaced with small england and wales flags . 
  i now believe in donald trump becoming a president . 
  apparently people do n't care about facts , there 's only feeling for some people . 
  well , if this leads to the collapse of eu , i 'm moving out of europe . 
  without eu , finland will be the next ukraine . 
  i find 6mil hard to believe . 
  our birthrates are so low that only during the famine of 1866 -- 68 was there a lower birthrate in our history . 
  we took many refugees last year but in the big picture there does n't seem to be massive immigration enough to make up for declining birthrates . 
  well , unless there 's a breakthrough in science that significantly extends the average human lifespan . 
  `` the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter . '', 
  - winston churchill frankly , i think decisions like this should not be decided by people who have no degree in economics . 
  the way i see it , gains of brexit seem negligible compared to possible economic consequences . 
  there 's a risk of not only economic problems in britain but a worldwide recession . 
  investors are already going nuts and if brexit happens it would be followed by a long process that would make massive waves of uncertainty and instability over the future of eu and britain . 
  i just have this mental image of british nationalists , drunks and reality-tv stars voting about the world economy and it 's very disturbing . 
  if everyone followed this example , we could eliminate the need for fossil fuels in the next few years . 
  unfortunately , humans are not logic driven but emotion driven . 
  this is why we fear planes more than cars and nuclear more than coal plants . 
  because plane crashes and nuclear malfunctions/accidents get sensationalist media coverage . 
  both the green movement and oil companies exploit nuclear paranoia and in fact i think some of these `` green movements '' are funded by no other than big oil companies themselves . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqc7wo7veke just embrace it, 
  only normal for north finland . 
  finland is a big country and there can be snow in the north while here in the south it 's +25 c warm . 
  10 and 12 happened to me in the most cringe way possible . 
  i notice there 's no `` free seats '' so i sit next to this dude . 
  next thing i know he starts taking long stares at me every minute or so making me concerned if there 's something off in my appearance . 
  then it looks like he 's going to stand up so i assume he 's leaving at the next stop . 
  `` no , no !, 
  sit down ! '', 
  he says in english and asks me where i 'm coming from ... `` work '' . 
  luckily by the time he was going to ask about my job , i was already leaving next stop . 
  foreigners are weird . 
  if nato would take serious military action , we would be looking at a third world war . 
  at that point there would be bigger worries than nato or eu collapsing , especially if nuclear weapons are involved . 
  sure , you might be correct too . 
  it may well be that no one will never dare to test nato or the alliance will really start a major war to defend itself . 
  really , it 's all speculation . 
  i 'm just saying that on paper , it 's not as clear cut as many pro-nato politicians claim it is .
