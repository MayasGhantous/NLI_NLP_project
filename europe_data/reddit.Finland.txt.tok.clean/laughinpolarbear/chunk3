  on android i 've heard of anything between 90-99 % of the downloads for paid games being pirated . 
  there 's just so many games , many of them free that people are not willing to pay much for something they have n't gotten a chance to try . 
  it also depends on what kind of game it is . 
  some games are more like services nowadays that are constantly updated and meant to last for years . 
  for that kind of games , the pay once model does n't work too well in the long run . 
  it 's almost you did n't even try . 
  you need to plant more trees . 
  [ well , their government seems to like finnish products just as much ] ( http://is.mediadelivery.io/img/1920/01a61bdbabbe4bbc9abae72df17cddb4.jpg ), 
  it still puzzles me how many educated people do n't understand the very basics of radiation . 
  apparently you could immediately tell when chernobyl had happened because `` water tasted different '' in finland . 
  oh and fukushima has contaminated the entire pacific ocean so remember to not eat any mutant fish from there . 
  funny when it 's a white woman , everyone ( even some people here in the comments ) go to great efforts to paint her as a * victim * , how she 's been `` seduced to join in '' but if it was a muslim man most people would want them the exact same treatment as these evil worthless vermin have given to all those people ( including children ) they 've tortured , beheaded , buried alive or raped . 
  you were the chosen ones estonia and hungary !, 
  :( you were supposed to destroy the indo-europeans , not join them . 
  you were supposed to bring balance to the languages , not leave it in darkness . 
  it 's creepy ( just clicked the article , i should n't have ) but am i the only one wondering what kind of criteria is used to determine whether a doll or cartoon character is a child or an adult ? 
  usually it 's probably obvious but with teenage characters , you often ca n't tell them apart from young adults . 
  or what if it 's a young woman with a flat chest ? 
  matthew 5:17 -18 `` do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets ; i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them . '', 
  `` for truly i tell you , until heaven and earth disappear , not the smallest letter , not the least stroke of a pen , will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished . '', 
  i 'm not saying and i do n't think you 're going to stone infidels and gays because i do n't think you take the bible as fundamentally as you think you do . 
  but hey , that 's just my opinion . 
  as an atheist , i actually agree with you that being a `` moderate christian '' ( or muslim/jew ) makes one either ignorant or a cherry picking hypocrite but to take the bible ** literally ** and putting into action what is told in the book ( gods commands to kill certain groups of people ) ? 
  that makes you a misogynistic , homophobic , racist ethnic cleanser and a religious terrorist . 
  people who actually have read the bible also know that jesus said that all those horrible laws of the old testament are still valid for his followers . 
  * `` to most christians , the bible is like a software license . 
  nobody actually reads it . 
  they just scroll to the bottom and click ' i agree ' . '' * - bill maher, 
  i agree but in many western and asian countries the birth count is already near or below replacement level . 
  population growth is mostly driven by africa right now . 
  child mortality has decreased a lot though ( which is great news ) , that 's why the population is growing as much as it is . 
  but if there were less babies then more resources could be put on the babies that are born . 
  i would n't call it inhumane , it 's way more humane than having 10 children and seeing how many of them can make it past the age of 5 ... not to mention in many countries in africa , women do n't really have a say in whether to have more children or not . 
  there might be no contraceptives available and rape is common ( if it happens inside marriage it often wont even be considered rape ) . 
  you can not make that comparison when [ large parts of africa are uninhabitable desert ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw-v2/images/africa.gif ) etc. . . 
  sadly with climate change it 's only going to get worse . 
  i believe sterilization after 2nd or 3rd child birth would be a fair way to prevent overpopulation getting out of hand , protect the climate and save millions of children from otherwise certain death . 
  `` routinely siding with palestinian terrorists '' is a bit extreme way to put it , but i feel like you 're using a strawman here , u/misgenderedrhino did n't state what his/her stance is in regards to the settlements . 
  i 'm pro-israel in the sense that i think israel has a right to exist as a nation , jews have a right to exist as people and they have a right to defend their own people ( do not forget they 're also protecting peaceful arabs/palestinians working or living in israel ) . 
  at the same time i 'm anti-settlement . 
  but on the other side you have terrorist groups like hamas that want to completely wipe israel off the map . 
  you have [ childrens tv shows about `` shooting all jews '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oram-usqhq ) , you have [ 67 % of the population supporting stabbing attacks on civilian jews ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/12051848/more-than-two-thirds-of-palestinians-support-knife-attacks-against-israelis.html ) , [ there 's parents training toddlers to stab jews ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwpfvrsgqq ) ... 
  i mean it is ** really ** not understood how widespread radicalism is in palestine . 
  finland can into southern europe !, 
  fyi european jews make up less than half of all israelis . 
  many jews from the middle east moved there because it got dangerous to be a jew where they used to live . 
  many europeans moved there after legally buying land from local landlords in the ottoman empire way before ww2 . 
  take a look at the timeline picture i posted . 
  the region has been under numerous different rulers and had different majorities , sometimes jews , sometimes christians , sometimes muslims . 
  there are no agreed rules that people can use to claim their right to a piece of land . 
  after the collapse of the ottoman empire many new arab/muslim majority countries were formed by * british/french literally drawing lines on a map of middle east * ( this is partially why the region is such a mess even today ) but yet you 're only questioning the legitimity of a tiny jewish country formed with un approval ? 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/c2f393d98db94b4fe8cc220015eb346a.png pulling things out of context is convenient but ignores : 1 . 
  jewish history of the region long before palestinians 2 . 
  that there never was a state called palestine 3 . 
  british promised the land to ** both ** jews and palestinians . 
  but wait , what right did the brits have to decide about the land anyway ? 
  you 're ignoring the role of egypt and jordan and so on ... 
  what am i supposed to think when [ even their own polls ] ( http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/623 ) show 67 % support for stabbing jews ? 
  and when they air tv shows teaching kids how all jews must be killed ... big part of the problem is that both israel and palestine have their own crazy religious people and extremists . 
  if you do research though , you notice that a large number of israelis oppose or criticize settlements . 
  lets be real here , it 's 2017 so [ being a pawn for trump is n't much different .

  supercell ( finnish game company ) should be on this list i think ... [ clash of clans maker supercell becomes europe 's first ` decacorn ' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/23/clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-becomes-europes-first-decacorn ) `` the deal will see tencent and its partners secure an 84.3 % stake in supercell , best known for its clash of clans mobile game , paying $ 8.6 bn ( # 5.78 bn ) for the pleasure . 
  that values the overall company at $ 10.2 bn , the first european technology startup to break that barrier . '', 
  i always mess this up and have to edit it afterwards, 
  [ but wait ... if italy is a leg and spain is a head ... ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wlbag ), 
  yes there is . 
  bacteria evolving a resistance to antibiotics , which ( although being bad news for humans ) is clearly a positive for the bacteria . 
  natural selection . 
  changes and mutations are random but the bad ones do not make it in the end . 
  bacteria without resistance gets killed off by antibiotics so only those with resistance survive . 
  sometimes neutral features will also stay . 
  this is why whales still have bones for fingers even though they 're now useless . 
  no i just gave you evidence . 
  get yourself mrsa and try to treat it with methicillin . 
  you did n't give any concerns but i 'm interested to hear them . 
  also you just contradicted yourself . 
  in your first comment you said evolution is `` a completely unproven theory '' but now you suddenly accept there 's overwhelming evidence in support of it ? 
  i hope you 're trolling . 
  evolution theory = / = evolution in pokemon , you idiot ... 
  so what is your alternative theory , may i ask ? 
  god shaped different breeds of dogs out of clay ? 
  when you go to a doctor and it is found you have methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , you can choose between the new or old antibiotics , you choose the old antibiotics because you refuse to believe that the bacteria has gained resistance to that kind of antibiotics through changes in its dna ( evolution ) ? 
  let me put it this way : do you believe that dna exists ? 
  do you believe that changes can happen in the dna ? 
  if you answer yes to both , then you already have accepted evolution . 
  because evolution is just bunch of these changes over long periods of time and `` species '' is just a human concept to classify creatures with similar ( but not the same ! ), 
  genes into groups according to certain criteria . 
  not really . 
  the `` more extreme wing '' gained ground ( or as many put it `` completely took over/hijacked the party '' ) but only ** within ** the finns party . 
  the party itself has lost half of its voters during the last 2 years . 
  will be interesting to see whether they will gain or lose votes and members with the changes . 
  with the refugee crisis there definitely was a spike in racist movement but that situation has calmed down a lot . 
  of course there 's still great concern about how to prevent terrorism but i would n't call it racism . 
  i mean , i 've seen many statements and blog posts from people with an immigrant/refugee/muslim background publicly being very worried about terrorism , radicalism and even integration issues . 
  i doubt there will be any bills about gay marriage . 
  it actually would 've been easier to do it with the finns party since they have way more seats than christian democrats . 
  yet they made clear that they 're not going to try and change it . 
  remember that the citizens initiative against gay marriage was quickly rejected .
