  he does n't want to exclude the french !, 
  sail their country over ? 
  it 's already sinking and they have n't even left the mainland . 
  peugeot ds ?

  i bet that at least 75 % of wine sold in finland is sold in [ these ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qivz1cf.jpg ) .

  they sure ended up burning a lot of bridges while attempting to build a land bridge between russia and crimea . 
  obviously it 's the only logical language in the world . 
  it 's mutual . 
  though your language is * so * weird . 
  they ought to bring back gladiators . 
  ca n't argue with that without being a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 . 
  i 'm not sure if the current budget is sufficient to maintain the high pisa scores , though . 
  or prisma express , though as far as i know they discontinued [ rainbow vodka ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sx66pv5.png ) . 
  oh , look at all those nato countries involved . 
  how is * america * stuck in another crisis ? 
  that ca n't be true , supermarkets in eastern finland are full of cheese-craving russians . 
  cyka,

  tl ; dr : fm station wo n't happen , but they 'll still deploy an internet radio . 
  smuggling polish apples and finnish dairy products , sounds like a fantastic job . 
  i wonder why finland 's standard of living is much better than that of any other european country which borders russia , save for norway . 
  well , at least [ this ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/novosti/ ) airs every now and then . 
  finland always is . 
  you know , most of those 100 % countries do n't heavily rely on gas for heating purposes .

  if 14 % of murders are gun murders , would n't that make gun owners more violent ? 
  14 % of already high homicide rate by european standards . 
  i do n't know if that 's a good example , really . 
  and [ here ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnbays_english-language_news_reporting_under_scrutiny/7177044 ) 's the article in english .

  or from the ferry , it 's about as cheap and it is n't unusual to be too hungover to board tallinn .

  i 'm joking about italian attitude on engineering .

  i do n't like it much , no . 
  many of the visitors here are rather inconsiderate . 
  i somehow completely ignored that part of the equation , and focused my mind on `` how on earth do persus increase amount of russians ? '',

  not that many permanent residents , but loads of visitors . 
  if you take a look at border towns ' parking lots , sometimes russian plates outnumber finnish ones . 
   it 's always perfect i guess that 's italian influence .
