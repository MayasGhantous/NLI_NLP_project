  according to that nigeria is one of the happiest places on earth . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  i need to do this with the locations i frequent so the following morning i know where i 've been . 
  good thing this is n't their sub , then . 
  shut up , go eat your p\u00f8lse and enjoy it like a good dane !, 
  outdated data , greece ought to have the eu flag . 
  basically kids going fuck the poliisi . 
  [ wrong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_eurovision_song_contest_winners#by_country ) . 
  cool account . 
  reads right in the title . 
  did you just ... remove upvote from yourself ? 
  in this case we have no idea either . 
  heh , that 's something like the finnish `` kokoo kokoon koko kokko . 
  koko kokko '' , which translates to `` gather up a full bonfire !, 
  the whole bonfire ? 
  the whole bonfire '' . 
  apinasta . 
  i did n't find it on reddit , did n't have a clue it had already been posted elsewhere . 
  i reckon they are n't too comparable , since depending on context many of the examples would be used in everyday language . 
  because finnish . 
  edit : well , technically they do say it with slightly different nuances . 
  some , for example , leave an impression that there still are some pieces of your moon left , some leave an impression that your moon is only divided to six pieces . 
  no , we 're saying the same thing . 
  and in finnish it is as diverse as cunt is for australians . 
  interesting !, 
  well , it often fails to translate the simplest finnish phrases . 
  i ca n't believe it , for once google translate got it spot on !, 
  [ another ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c__2n79owqg ) from the same series . 
  this , in my opinion , is the best bread sold in finland . 
  well i really recommend checking out [ danger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3fyw-8xduw ) . 
  well , depends what genre you like , really . 
  for drum and bass i generally look towards other countries , namely uk , germany , netherlands and italy . 
  yes !, 
  i recall reading that nadeo , the company behind it , only has like 30 employees . 
   that was a while ago , though , before ubisoft acquired them . 
  would you consider it is fair to say that while german cars are great , it is thanks to the americans who invented mass production cars ? 
  thanks for that band , i do like it !, 
  they make the best electronic music , like danger , justice and of course daft punk . 
  also , my favourite video game is french - trackmania !, 
  that would be greece . 
  as if uk would leave . 
  or from this [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_language ) . 
  both irish and gaelic are acceptable . 
  looks like you got your definitions upside-down . 
  ^ he ^ he ^ he, 
  probably true , since they help everyone and paedophiles are part of that group . 
  that is exactly how i view both countries . 
  but in a limited time it should n't be a high priority to study a language you probably wo n't ever use later on in life . 
  even splitting it so that pupils could choose between swedish and russian would be better . 
  the northernmost somali city !, 
  for some reason finns are running out of livers . 
  yeah , the first language of 98 % of the people . 
  you did n't comprehend `` samma p\u00e5 svenska '' ? 
  well , since pulla is n't exactly bad it does make sense , even though i also lean towards your definition . 
  maybe it originally meant something pleasant ? 
  yeah , in eastern finland absolutely no-one speaks swedish , yet russian is commonplace . 
  and they still learn swedish . 
  as expected , sadly . 
  probably pronounced very differently . 
  :p by the way , pula means distress or absence of something vital , like food in finnish . 
  fantastic job on that !, 
  close . 
  poliklinik and endoskopi . 
  and the guy installing the sign just could n't give a * fan * . 
  it , word-by-word says `` rosten 's delicious forced sweetroll '' . 
  rosten is a bakery , but pakkopulla is a phrase meaning an annoying task one must tackle regardless . 
  it also picks on pakkoruotsi , mandatory swedish taught in schools . 
  samma p\u00e5 svenska is purely a placeholder . 
  the languages are completely different . 
  that 's not how placeholders work . 
  indeed . 
  here 's another [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k4pn8bv.jpg ) in celebration !, 
  their health is of the utmost importance for us . 
  imagine had they rotated it full 360 degrees . 
  that surely would have cost 4mil . 
  finnish | swedish --------- | --------- polyclinic of internal medicine | same in swedish waiting rooms 5 , 6 and 13 | same in swedish reception | same in swedish endoscopy | same in swedish heart research | same in swedish, 
  indeed . 
  i would n't be surprised if they learnt our name from [ wodka ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/finlandia_vodka_logo.png ) !, 
  i oddly enough enjoy cooking immensely while drunk . 
  but if i wo n't end up in my flat then usually kebab with chips . 
  this made me feel warm inside . 
  which is useful since it 's getting bloody cold outside . 
  good idea , let 's make turku the new malm\u00f6 . 
  freedom !, 
  in finland . 
  not really , german and french are way more popular than spanish . 
  russian is becoming more popular as a choice as well . 
  aww , thanks , i can send you a potato in mail if you pm me your address . 
  should europe should ? 
  maybe they should n't should . 
  some people might have upvoted / u/w00ster since it was a reasonably amusing joke , not due to ideologies . 
  i know , what a crazy thought . 
  what ? 
  til !, 
  i think that 's a bit of an understatement . 
  odd , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snowcastle_of_kemi ) is n't included in that list . 
  new kids taught me that bakpao is the dutch staple . 
  hmm nah , pirkka is n't that bad . 
  though none of our bulk beers are worth shouting about . 
  it boils down to opinions , as in , which weird side taste you hate the least in beer .
