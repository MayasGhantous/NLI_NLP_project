  koff and karjala are the shittiest in my opinion . 
  it 's good , not quite like salmari though . 
  :-p then again these salty liquorice drinks all bring instant flashbacks if you even once drink them too heavily ... 
  but it is n't even hot , only spicy . 
  you 'd surely love [ salmiakki koskenkorva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salmiakki_koskenkorva ) . 
  i can see him getting used to the taste over time , though . 
  give some facts , i might be able to give them some colour . 
  apparently they were able to afford a television . 
  they did n't pay the tv license fee , what did they expect ? 
  being old is n't a get out of jail free card ... 
  \\* stares \\*, 
  well , we do not have a gourmet tradition . 
  then again i think the only purpose behind gourmet is showing off . 
  the words we use * are * the checksums , we lost the original words . 
  well , mr. general , you still do realise that we still practically are sweden 's defence forces ? 
  opening a door is [ something finns learn at an older age ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wof0xpumw38 ) . 
  finns are honest and silent folk , though . 
  which is why i struggle to see the point of swedish being mandatory . 
  is it really a problem , though ? 
  swedes generally speak decent english . 
  i recall that the song was made in 1995 to celebrate the inevitable victory of sweden against finland in the hockey finals . 
  then we won and used the song for celebrating our victory . 
  [ will do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=344ku6csjfi ) . 
  some of them are [ rather pretty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vxd9ekrp6i ) as well . 
  and that tradition is alive and well , judging by what i saw during last weekend 's cruise . 
  i reckon it 's mainly because they do n't have that much foreign influence in their mainstream media . 
  and most of what they have is an american caricature of the countries . 
  western media as a whole is heavily influenced by the american culture , but we have our own cultures as well . 
  that 's a luxury that exists in much lesser extent within the usa . 
   i suggest you do more reading and less misinformation before having an opinion . 
  funny * you * should say that . 
  it appears their cocky mentality towards other nations is n't just all talk . 
  i thought it was a dialect which was minor within england but somehow took over in america . 
  `` we 're * free * , now , let 's rename some shit to confuse people ! '', 
  as far as i am concerned , this map is accurate . 
  [ you sure ] ( http://englishrussia.com/tag/russian-roads ) ? 
  that actually sums up the drivable roads in russia , though it 's a bit optimistic . 
  they were decent colonies but no-one needs them so we decided not to rule them . 
  not even close . 
  our * what * ? 
  you can always wish . 
  russia stealing our drainage with neva river . 
  damn them !, 
  i rarely even smile at jokes i read on reddit . 
  this , somehow , made me laugh hysterically . 
  well , many people drive their bmws as * the ultimate ego machine * . 
  then again sauna is the finnish word for it , while swedes use bastu . 
  no , obviously it 's [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yinhiz9.jpg ) absolute maniacs . 
  do n't you mean litres ?

  did you mean : * [ ryyppyfiilis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojxzhymfimq ) *, 
  pulma means problem in finnish , pulm means wedding in estonian . 
  why do they associate eu so strongly with usa ? 
  i do n't think it serves a meaningful purpose .

  not true !, 
  you forgot darude !, 
  [ another option ] ( https://i.imgur.com/i8rwrzp.png ), 
  well , you could argue that the independence day parade is held to remind us about not becoming an autocratic state . 
  i 'd prefer simple finns . 
  [ refind ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/refind ) is pretty gud .

  grub is a bit 2000s do n't you think ?

  rather one cramped bmw than two ladas ? 
  some suvs and wagons have seats in the boot for kids , for a total of seven , but that 's about it . 
  `` a group of eight men later arrived in a bmw '' how , a bmw towing a caravan ? 
  nothing . 
  sweden is out of the question . 
  norway is a contender with all that oil money . 
  [ more facts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwvavccnts ) . 
  because it 's it 's illegal to sell beer stronger than 4.7 % in grocery stores . 
  if it is stronger than that it has to be sold by alko , which is a state monopoly liquor store . 
  that would also make it significantly more expensive . 
  i can see the pant information on top of the can , estonian cans do n't have that .
