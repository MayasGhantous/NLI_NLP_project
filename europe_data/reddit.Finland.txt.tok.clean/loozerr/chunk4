  [ imported beer ] ( https://i.imgur.com/s4bppa7.png ) [ domestic beer ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5tzoku4.jpg ) besides , nobody imports nobelaner , it 's from lidl . 
  are you / u/laukaus from laukaus forums ? 
  sounds like you would enjoy [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vuixwms.png ) . 
   gawker, 
  or , you know , ukraine . 
  wake up !, 
  no but in america the poorer you are the objectively worse human being you are . 
  what ? 
  ** terror ** ism . 
  red light cameras are understandable , speed cameras are mostly a money grab . 
  but i do n't mind speed cameras placed before intersections . 
  your speeding tickets are really cheap compared to many european countries . 
  no , the chart is weird . 
  it could be worse . 
  is n't that just another way of saying `` they did n't take the official stance '' ? 
  some americans thought we were russian when we were speaking finnish . 
  [ this probably is n't ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bwmlaut.png ) . 
  \\ #triggered, 
  though i had to settle with uk since finland was n't included . 
  many of our inventions we take for granted do n't make it across the english channel , like taps with two inputs . 
  from third to ninth grade . 
  it 's something finns tend to play on summer cottages . 
  that 's why you plough the snow * after * snowstorms . 
  absolutely covered in condensed steam * :p, 
  [ liberian county flags ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_liberia#county_flags ) are quite excellent as well . 
  * haram *, 
   this is why cops do n't carry concealed . 
  then again they do n't have the element of surprise to begin with - of course cops always have a gun ( in america ) . 
  well , the majority still voted against trump . 
  thank electoral college . 
  worry not . 
  they can just burn oil to keep themselves warm !, 
  he 's doing you germans a favour . 
  good riddance , then . 
  people vouching for restoration would lose interest quickly after seeing the bill . 
  i do n't think you can just brush it off as a statistical anomaly since there are clear reasons for the increase in attacks . 
  obviously it is n't a normal , everyday occurance , but what 's your point ? 
  seeing a terrorist attack in news is nowadays more disappointing than it is shocking . 
  terrorism has been on the rise recently . 
  you twisting the timeline does no favours . 
  it 's like saying `` climate change is n't happening , see , earth was a lot warmer millions of years ago '' . 
  without a question . 
  the whole situation is a mess when so blatantly incorrect campaigns are so successful . 
  in that case you should n't have the power to cause others become fucked . 
  editable titles would suck more . 
  it is n't full-scale war per se , but it is a war and there is only one nation to blame for it - russia . 
  i heard having two mad candidates is the new big thing . 
  well , we finns generally drink it with regret after buying it ex tempore on our boozing trips . 
   do n't know why do you think i would because you use the language of russia 's apologists - `` it 's a war between ukraine and donbas rebels who are backed by russia '' makes it quite clear . 
  no mixing of empty and full cans !, 
  are you insane ? 
  if you 're lucky there will be a couple left for the morning after !, 
  alcohol yes , just not any alcohol . 
  a case of 24 4.7 % bulk lagers for around 23 $ is the finnish weekend staple . 
  that is just how russian military works nowadays . 
  ukraine is no different from the land grab russia pulled off in georgia . 
  and i thought finland had the strictest system where alko ( our own systemet ) is open 9-20 and mild drinks ( < 4.7 % , fermented only ) can be sold in markets from 9 to 21 . 
  i was somewhat surprised on my trip to sweden . 
  not to mention the bars were more expensive as well and apparently had to also serve food !, 
  luckily there 's always estonia , i hope they 'll never into nordic because of this . 
  just rebels , like in luhansk where a ~ ~ russian ~ ~ rebel tank battalion took over the airport . 
  i am not an expert but i am pretty sure it would be * piss off and stop taking our jerbs *, 
  well it 's also misspelled . 
  overexaggerate is the correct spelling , with 1 r and 2 g : s. :p, 
  so danish ? 
  i unfortunately do n't . 
  [ this ] ( http://pgn-stage.wsipp.wa.gov/reportfile/1152/wsipp_recidivism-the-effect-of-incarceration-and-length-of-time-served_full-report.pdf ) is somewhat related , but in addition to being very broad it 's also written from an american perspective . 
  ( in finnish ), 
  i also recall reading somewhere that longer sentences basically only deter financial crime since it is generally carefully planned . 
  other crimes are generally done on impulse or by people who are convinced that they 'll get away with it . 
  not even most of finland , you only get winter solstice in rovaniemi and up . 
  and if you go further west you 'll find b\u00f6gs . 
  i suppose this was a revenge for stealing someone 's p\u00f8lse then . 
  amen . 
  seeing that many of the claims made by brexit campaign were blatant lies , their victory should n't be celebrated as a shining example of democracy at work . 
  did you skip the context of the message you originally replied to ? 
  i am not the one demanding changes to status quo . 
  did my comment violate your * freedom * ? 
  this is bullshit and i hope lax gun laws never pass in europe - abundance of guns causes much more harm than good . 
  i 'm also tired of people using these tragedies as a tool to push their agenda . 
  it 's been half an hour from first reports and already we have our own resident gun nut telling us how magical second amendment is . 
  maybe they reported the news as a normal story but did n't run the clickbait train to death ? 
  what should us finns do with the buses then ? 
  have them roam around the country without passengers ? 
  appropriately enough that kinda looks like sputnik . 
  such a shame that it did n't happen during the weekend , storms are boring inland . 
  finland does have flat , flooding regions . 
  [ example ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sahaome.jpg ) [ source and more photos ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/nain-tulvii-kauhajoki-katso-pysayttavat-ilmakuvat/1893800 ), 
  no flood events in ostrobothnia ? 
  hmm . 
   scandinavian languages i do n't think that 's a correct term for it like north germanic languages is . 
  honestly i do n't know and do n't really care either - i just could n't miss a chance to scold a swede . 
  i mean , languages spoken in scandinavia are germanic . 
   finnish is not a scandinavian language . 
  you could say that it 's within arm 's reach . 
  huh . 
  i have no qualms about my lumia 925 's hardware . 
  the software , however ... 
  especially since ms decided that the hardware ca n't run wp10 . 
  the developer preview runs like a dream .
