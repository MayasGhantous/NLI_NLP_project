  but nope , apparently release version is too much for 925 to handle . 
  slightly newer entry level phones apparently run it fine , though !,

  if you keep enjoying your * pussikalja * you might ascend one day and become an * alan mies * , * `` man of the trade '' * . 
  upm is still alive and kicking , but the voikkaa factory got shut down . 
  yeah - but in case of ford gt it 's not the 5.0 that is called exoboost - not even the mustang gt 5.0 if he referred to that . 
  it 's the 3.5 l v6 they 're calling ecoboost . 
  you have my axe . 
  not * all * nordics ... 
   there are the occasional driver that lack features found in the windows version , but that us not a linux issue , but rather a lack of vendor support issue . 
  and guess what , it 's still a real problem and someone who needs that functionality ca n't use linux as their primary os . 
  dismissing real issues is counter-productive . 
  it 's not the point in linux vs. windows in this case . 
  nobody is looking to freeboot - it 's about cutting dependency to a single united states-based company . 
  even if it was about saving money , bulk of the cost comes from actual maintenance . 
  and there linux can actually be more costly , especially since most sysadmins are used to active directory . 
  and how is that unique to linux ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  yeah , linux is behind competition in desktop use . 
  but reliability ? 
  its reliability is one of the reasons its the dominant server operating system . 
  you 're also quite wrong on what has driven its development . 
  large companies have spent a lot of development time on linux as well - see [ here ] ( http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/whos-writing-linux ) for more detail if you want to learn - but i doubt that 's the case . 
  they do - but they also run closed source alongside it . 
  like . 
  how about [ atlantropa ] ( https://youtu.be/tedsqmjlmks ) ? 
  quite a few are in a `` ca n't get a job because i have no experience '' -  `` ca n't get experience because i ca n't find a job '' - loop,

  not even sorry , fake flair ? 
   but can you check if you are resistant yes ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  sounds about right , since there 's nothing to either like or dislike in its taste . 
  rushing deagle ? 
  well , anything is possible on eu east servers . 
  oh fuck off with the last bit , next you 'll claim that robbery is fine - stores just should be built like fortresses !, 
  and good security practices only take you so far - day 0 attacks and backdoors cia keeps to themselves are n't something an admin can reasonably do much about . 
  unless employee phones are collected and companies are completely isolated from the internet . 
  now with poland as a sovereign country it 's a symbol of rational thought , since you did n't demolish it out of pettiness but instead took full advantage of the building . 
   freezing cold  rain what is this wizardry ? 
  that 's because it was n't , those are low or medium graphics . 
  the driving mechanics are still quite solid . 
  but they managed to divide the already small community with separate tm2 releases and nowdays only tm2 : stadium is played pretty much .

  we just think you 're a bit too pompous for your own good . 
  they can be used to justify land grabs , russians simply saved parts of ukraine from the disgusting gay-loving europeans . 
  your values are at odds with swedish values and russians are n't exactly known for tolerating that . 
  you shut your whore mouth . 
   that 's being forcibly kept low now . 
  depends , the price is much higher than we finns are used to - and as a result we 'll probably see our contracts go up in price ...

   an anecdote from one person with pre-existing ear problems i see you did n't bother to read . 
   life itself is dangerous for your health .

   smoking cessation symptoms does n't include hearing problems . 
   but happily continue to use ordinary toothpaste which is n't exactly meant to be inhaled . 
  basically , there 's reason to believe that pg can cause hearing issues - so , at least i 'd like to see a study about vaping specifically before completely dismissing the whole idea . 
  it 's not a matter of slamming vaping altogether , but riding the `` e-cigs are completely safe '' - train seems a bit silly when there has n't been much research done . 
  being less unhealthy than cigarettes is n't much of an achievement in itself . 
  somehow some vapers have experienced similar symptoms . 
  i 'd just avoid pg since an alternative is available . 
  mate do n't be so defensive : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7192939 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1207541 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0196070988800267 http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/disorders/bilat/ototoxic_drops.htm longer post : https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2udarb/the_pg_in_ecigarettes_can_cause_hearing_problems/,

  though i guess it 's hard to quantify since it is n't a single attraction . 
  many also feel that eu is a net loss with no benefit , and only adds bureaucracy . 
  probably not , but seeing that it 's a relatively straight bit of country road it hardly matters . 
  also , it $ 5.2 m per kilometre is n't cheap but it is n't ridiculous eithea . 
  roads cost a fuckton even without solar paneling .
