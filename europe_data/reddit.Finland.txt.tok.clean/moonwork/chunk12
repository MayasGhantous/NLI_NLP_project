   edit : [ i looked up some details and years ] ( https://books.google.fi/books?id=buznzm-x0l8c&amp;pg=pa242&amp;lpg=pa242&amp;dq=finland+beer+in+grocery+stores+test&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zwehnio0bp&amp;sig=90vmdeo6gmzyo3xg0pgwxlx7xx8&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=x&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) , hence the obscene amount of parenthesis . 
  i 'd be ok with praying as long as it does n't interrupt classes and does n't make a scene . 
  someone feels like talking silently to their invisible superfriend during recess ? 
  by all means , go ahead . 
  i feel like rooney 's comment was held back . 
  he says not to travel unless you have a ticket , stay sensible , and thank you for your support . 
  to me that sounds like `` thanks for beating up those other fans guys , and remember to always have your mates ' backs '' . 
  why ca n't they just tell their fans to stop being violent ? 
  it 's not as if these fans will just up and leave , they 've cheered for these guys their whole lives !, 
  assuming brexit happens , who stands to gain the most ? 
  like our experiment with selling beer in grocery stores . 
  i feel like you misunderstood me . 
  i meant for it to be explained in a way that a 5-year-old cound understand it . 
  not explained by a 5-year-old . 
  also , [ ship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ship ) vs [ sheep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheep ) , although at this point i 'm not sure if you did that on purpose . 
  thanks , but i was n't asking for an explanation for myself . 
  i was merely stating my opinion on the contents of the link . 
  thank you for taking the time to explain it , even if you are preaching to the choir . 
   it seems you also agree with me :  mainstream media do n't really give you a good picture of how the eu is set up at all . 
  neither do textbooks , it is all being very simplified . 
  this is why we need better sources of information . 
  i feel like the point of this is n't to explain anything , but to just point out that yanis varoufakis is against brexit . 
  i feel what we need are less celebrities commenting on the issue , and more videos explaining the consequences on a level even a 5-year-old can understand . 
  i agree . 
  i do n't think it 's ok to let just anyone out from the uk . 
  there should be much more restrictions on letting brits out into the eu . 
  i 've been to spain , i 've seen the devastation of having a mass influx of brits and it 's not pretty . 
  ok , i 'm sincerely liking this idea . 
  any region could vote to be annexed by some other country . 
  this could really lead to countries cleaning up their governments . 
  the only thing we need now is a global governing entity to make sure people follow the rules . 
  oh , and we need rules as well . 
  i propose there be : * a minimum requirement for size for a region , measured in km ^ 2 as well as populous . 
  ( so that an area of 80m ^ 2 and inhabitants of one can not vote to be annexed by another country . ), 
  * once annexed by someone , said area can not vote for reannexation for a given period of time . 
  ( otherwise regions would abuse this too much . ), 
  any other rules we should add ? 
  you can see the lights from estonia from the tip of the porkkala peninsula as well , if the conditions are optimal . 
  that just raises more questions !, 
  this analogy just keeps confusing me more and more . . 
  while i 'm not going to take a stance on what level free speech i would prefer , hitchens , in all his brilliancy , does give the impression that he 's mostly surrounded by people who are either rational scholars with whom he has interesting debates , or then irrational sociopaths who threaten him and his children . 
  it irks me to no end that the name of the video is `` mr bean talk about immigration '' . 
  that 's not mr bean giving a speech . 
  that 's not even the guy who plays mr bean talking . 
  that 's a persona played by the same man who also plays mr bean . 
  but the speech is given neither by mr bean , nor the actor , but a version of a member of the conservative party . 
  having said that , i 'd still concede to the title being `` rowan atkinson on immigration '' . 
  what does that make north america ? 
  upvote for the word `` seksivau '' . 
  [ sigh . 
   generally quite reliable fine , i 'll concede that they do n't pull shit out of thin air . 
  but they do make stories where there might not actually be one . 
  these can sometimes be identified by the use of the prefix `` kohu '' . 
  but my main concern with their credibility is their lack of source criticism . 
  they 've been caught filling their pages with long since debunked urban legends and some of their `` primary sources '' have basically been friends and family of celebrities who got paid to say something . 
  they 've got entertainment value , but i would n't trust anything they printed before it 's confirmed elsewhere . 
   the ilta-sanomat newspaper reports calling ilta-sanomat a newspaper makes it sound like a credible source . 
  they 're a sensationalist tabloid , through and through . 
  it 's far from cheap , you just do n't pay with money . 
  the real eyeopener in this is to read the comments about how many brits actually seem to want to leave . 
  that and how a large portion of the leave - arguments are misinformed . 
  where is this `` here '' you speak of ? 
  the only time i speak finnish is when talking to strangers . 
   europe 's far right was supposed to be dead and buried what ? 
  the only thing talked about for the last two years is how it 's being resurrected . 
  how is this somehow a surprise now ? 
  edit : [ this article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html?_r=1 ) has some nice graphics on how the right has been growing for the last 15 years . 
  at least you 're ranked as top50 . 
  the question that immediately comes to my mind when reading your comment is , if you and one of these `` young men who bring a culture of violence '' both stand in the line to immigrate into a western country . 
  how will we separate yourself , who is clearly capable of civilized behaviour , from that other young man ? 
  as much as i think brainwashed religious nuts ( of any given denomination ) have no place in civilized society , i think we need to have reasonable ways of enforcing this . 
  i just do n't think `` oh , you 're from < middle-eastern country with history of violence  , you ca n't enter '' is a viable reason to not let a person in . 
  should there maybe be some form of personality/culture test , to see who will fit ? 
  or is that also a really bad idea ? 
  maybe it 's because i do n't really speak much with strangers when abroad , but the only annoying thing that comes up repeatedly with any and all foreigners is how the swedes really want to try and curse in finnish . 
  it 's sounds like a baby house cat trying to roar . 
  ok , i get that people want this to happen and are pushing for it . 
  but is it actually happening ? 
  please accept these complimentary wood carving knives as a token of our kinship and agreement over how sweden should take it . 
  kind regards , your nordic sister . 
  suck it , sweden . 
  this is the measure of `` perceived trust '' , right ? 
  i mean , there 's a difference between asking a person if they trust something or if you have them read something and ask if it 's correct . 
  i agree , charlie hebdo should be free to be as crappy as they want to be . 
  it should be any person 's thor-given right to draw any shit their heart desires . 
  i may not laugh at charlie hebdo 's jokes , but i 'll fight for their right to print them . 
  what 's with the `` lazy people destination '' on sweden ? 
  when you have dragons you do n't need votes . 
  not sure if sarcasm . . 
  i 'm just pointing out that for some people it genuinely feels like russia is at odds with the major part of the world . 
  you tried to make it sound like russia 's doing good acting as a benevolent force in the world . 
  i just wanted to point out that right outside russia , it really does n't look like it . 
   it appears you live in some odd fantasy universe where the whole world is at odds with russia over its actions in ukraine or for whatever other reason . 
  your fantasy universe sounds pretty much like my actual universe . 
  i do n't pretend to know what `` the entire world '' thinks , but here in finland it 's been a while since i heard anybody say anything positive about russia as a country . 
  the russians i come into contact with seem to be more and more pro-russia , and the rest of the people seem to distrust russians more and more . 
  i 'm not saying there 's good reason to distrust russians , but it does feel like the russian government is doing splendid work with controlling its people through the media . 
  it genuinely feels like they 've cracked the mystery on how to brainwash people efficiently . 
  i 've been to sydney once and spent a week there . 
  i recognize that chinatown restaurant and now i miss their food .
