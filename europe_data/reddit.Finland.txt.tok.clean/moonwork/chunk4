  what we have is people judging quickly and trying quick fixes without much research being publicised about the matter . 
  i 'm sure there is research being done from several angles on the romani ( and other ) beggars , but the results do n't get nearly enough attention . 
  . . just my two cents . 
  i admit , them wanting to join sweden is an old notion not held by many anymore - i was exaggerating . 
  the people i 've spoken to from \u00c5land do n't sound like they 're excited to be a part of finland , but rather like they 've accepted that they wo n't be moving to sweden . 
  then again , i have n't taken a poll of the population there , i 've just spoken to people while visiting there . 
  at least we appreciate them for their beer production , their red coloured granite and their potato crisps . 
  i do n't understand what they see in you . 
  sauce ? 
  a not insignificant amount of finnish speaking finns think the swedish speaking people should `` move back to sweden '' . 
  \u00c5land dreams of the day when they separate from finland and join sweden . 
  nobody else has any kind of inclination to give sweden any of finlands residents in any way . 
  has there been any mentions of margins of error anywhere ? 
  . . and at least i 've got my health !, 
  this broken way of voting in elections . 
  i feel like my vote does n't count and even if it did , i better vote for a party without idiots because my vote supports the entire party of my candidate . 
  well that escalated quickly . . 1 . 
  i seriously doubt there 's more swedish-speaking finns in here than finnish-speaking ones . 
  extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . 
  looking at kari tarkiainen 's bibliography , there 's no reason not to call him a swedish-speaking finn himself . 
  also `` pakko-ruotsi '' is a loaded term born out of propaganda , and it means `` mandatory swedish '' , not sweden . 
  edit : and i really do n't get what you 're referring to by `` elite '' and `` establishment '' , that just makes you sound like a conspiracy maniac . 
  how can most of the swedish speakers in finland be ethnically finns if they live in the same regions that have seen considerable genetic mixing since the days of the hanseatic league ? 
  i do n't understand . . why is this being downvoted ? 
  it 's referenced right there on the wiki page . 
  -- -- `` efter kolonisationen fick kusten n\u00e4stan helsvensk bos\u00e4ttning '' translated :  `` a swedish colonization was apparently of the massive kind and was governed from the top , mainly by the crown , as evidenced by the homesteads that were royal homesteads . 
  people did not arrive in peasantry vessels , and apparently from all sides of the svea kingdom - at least from uppland , sm\u00e5land , g\u00e4strikland and h\u00e4lsingland . '', 
  -- `` after the colonization the coast was nearly entirely made up of swedish settlements . '', 
  growing to be one large country ( like the us ) we 'll also be much more vulnerable to corruption . 
  mo ' money , mo ' powah . 
  nice !, 
  thanks !, 
  sauce ? 
  i 'm running linux in helsinki right now . 
  i can confirm that the rest of the world should enjoy this gift just as we do ourselves . 
  what 's a yardstick and how are these taxburdens calculated ? 
  it is essentially the truefinns , but sadly there 's a lot of them . 
  recent polls put the support for the truefinns at 18 % . 
  stock-picture of high speed train ? 
  i imagine the actual trains are n't running yet . . 
  polska , here i come !, 
  it would be especially cool to see the faces of the finns that actively diss having to pay any money to the eu because `` we do n't get anything out of it '' . 
  i should be laughing at the irony of jewish people behaving like nazis , but this is just to sad to watch . 
  finnish moms do n't get angry , they just grow even more disappointed . 
  that said , i 'm sure he gets his ass beaten on a regular basis , i just think it is n't by his mom . 
  my guess would be the other regulars at whatever sleezehole of a bar lets this guy in . 
  for some reason , i thought the danish women lived shorter lives than th danish men . 
  that thought seems ridiculous now . 
  i 'm pretty sure casper the unfriendly ghost there has had a few beers before he got out of his bachelor pad . 
  but i do like his friend 's [ jamiroquai hat ] ( http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/665572/jamiroquai.0.png ) !, 
  ^ ^ ^ \\ ( yes , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ cap , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ shadows ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ look ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ that . ), 
   would they instruct their women ( or even suggest ) that they should start dressing less modestly so as not to offend the european women ? 
  probably not , but that 's because of how they treat their women . 
  also , i ca n't help but feel that people are assuming the school changed their regulations and people bought entirely new wardrobes . 
  this is just about dressing up in the right manner when meeting them initially . 
  integrating one people into a somewhat different group of people is n't possible without cooperation on both sides . 
  this is n't specific to europe , nor the middle east ; it 's universal . 
  this does n't mean the host has to change , it just means they have to be accomodating and let the integrating group into their fold . 
  being nice to people when you meet them for the first time is a part of this . 
  this is n't about conforming to the newcomers . 
  this is about making a transition easier . 
  think of it like dressing up when you meet your new neighbours for the first time . 
  your neighbours do n't dictate how you dress long term , but you want to make a good first impression for the sake of ~ ~ integration ~ ~ the neighborhood . 
  they also state that it is n't a rule . 
  translation :  according to [ ( art teacher ) olli punto ] the students were informed of the meaning of the dress code , nobody has required anyone else to change their dressing style . 
  they 've been talking about how the students , when first interacting with the new refugees , might want to cover up a bit in order to not confuse the refugees whose culture regarding womens clothing differs from the locals . 
  nobody 's requiring or demanding anything . 
  it 's supposed to be a tip on how to communicate better with very recently arrived refugees ; not a strong suggestion for when interacting with muslims in general . 
  this is not about accommodating foreign rules and law , this is about trying to smooth over the initial process of integrating people from a not insignificantly different culture . 
  it 's almost like finland should be called something swamp-related in at least one of the native languages . 
  ( yeah , yeah , it 's not scientifically proven or agreed upon , but it 's sort of still true . ), 
  so the warnings that putin talk about is about warning the usa , not the eu ? 
   russia has frequently warned of major problems which europe would face as a result of western policies it sounds like they 're saying putin has warned the eu about eu 's policies . 
  referring to everything west of russia as `` the west '' is not helping on the clarity of this issue . 
  ok , so not racist . 
  check . 
  so , why is it bad that you let in people of a different ethnic heritage into your country ? 
  hang on , so putin has been `` warning '' the eu for years that their policies in the middle east would cause a crisis ? 
  so ... is he saying we should have sent troops into syria ? 
  or into the middle east in general ? 
  what exactly is he saying the eu should have done ? 
  you know , aside from `` leave my puppets alone '' and `` i predicted this a long time ago , whatever this is '' . 
  well i 'll be a monkey 's uncle . 
  i 've never heard those words before , yet i have relatives on gotland . 
  the title of the page says `` prime minister of spain '' and the first sentence reads  the president of the government of spain [ 1 ] ( spanish : presidente del gobierno ) , [ 2 ] ** formally known by english-speaking nations and formally translated by the european commission directorate-general in english as prime minister ** [ 1 ] is the head of government of spain . 
  so yes , i read it . 
  did you ? 
  [ really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_spain ) ? 
  er . . has norway really not won _ any _ ? 
  [ i would 've thought kalsarik\u00e4nnit was a household reddit term already . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3bbpcb/greatest_finnish_word_ever/ ), 
  the urban legends surface every now and then . 
  the one i remember most prominantly was the one about `` staring at breasts '' being `` good for mens health '' . 
  i remember that because i sent them a mail in regards to it asking about sources . 
  i never got a reply , but the article was removed a few days later . 
  there are still [ references to it ] ( http://gozamite.com/2008/02/11/iltalehti-tanaan/ ) . 
  there have been also been others . 
   finland is overflowing with university graduates , and among those journalism graduates . 
  iltalehti has no trouble finding capable journalists . 
  i 'm not saying they have trouble finding capable journalists .
