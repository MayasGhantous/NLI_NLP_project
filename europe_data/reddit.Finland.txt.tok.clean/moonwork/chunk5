  i 'm saying the office culture there is such that they do n't bother fact checking . 
  tabloids focus on sensationalism and pop culture . 
  tabloids are generally not considered experts on investigative journalism . 
  miriam webster defines `` tabloid '' as : of , relating to , or resembling tabloids ; especially : featuring stories of violence , crime , or scandal presented in a sensational manner iltalehti has , numerous times , printed urban legends as news . 
  their opinion is that `` investigative journalism '' means that you do a quick google search to check something . 
  yet they fail to even do this . 
  fine , i 'll concede to the term `` newspaper '' not necessarily always requiring investigative journalism . 
  that 's just means i need to find a better term for `` newspapers that actually do research '' in order to distinguish them from tabloids . 
  i do n't think nina leinonen was thrown out because of fear of propaganda . 
  i think she was thrown out because of fear she 'd report something that would cause more harm than good . 
  get back to me when a journalist from helsingin sanomat , hufvudstadsbladet or yle is thrown out . 
  then we can expect shenanigans . 
  i just want to point out that iltalehti is a tabloid , not a newspaper . 
  if i had the authority , i 'd probably throw out iltalehti ( and iltasanomat , their only actual rival ) too . 
   the fact of the matter is that the nordic welfare system is n't sustainable in its current form . 
  what the ... ? 
  are you real ? 
  what `` facts '' are these ? 
  . . and the us . 
  is this about ethnicity ? 
  or language group ? 
    religiously conservative - surprisingly so , considering the last elections   the elections in which the christian democrats lost support and fell from the government ? 
  [ yup . 
  * ultra-nationalist - apparently * poor - we 're getting there * religiously conservative - surprisingly so , considering the last elections * uneducated - i dare say this one does n't apply, 
  that 's already an infinitely better article than the daily mail one . 
  thank you !, 
  male acquaintance : handshake male good friend : verbal greeting/insult female acquaitance : handshake female good friend : verbal greeting , sometimes hug french both male or female : verbal greeting in clear english so that they understand i do n't speak french, 
  i 'm thinking people who do this sort of stuff should be thrown in jail . 
  partly as punishment , but mostly because i think they need to be reintroduced to society . 
  i guess a psyche evaluation would n't be entirely uncalled for either . 
  if anybody is wondering how to pronounce his name , it 's pronounced `` the shack '' . 
  perhaps , but it 's also the basis of aforementioned equality . 
  because the school lunch is free and literally ** everybody ** eats there . 
  if you have allergies , you let the school know and they prepare special meals for you , but the entire school eats at the school cafeteria . 
  in ** every ** ( public ) primary school in finland . 
  bringing your own lunch would have you sticking out of the group like an extra thumb . 
  you show a lot of focus on you and yours . 
  meanwhile you show nothing but disregard and disrespect for the people who have to manage your kids ( and yourself ) alongside several hundred others . 
   you ca n't even take your own lunch to school here . 
  why would you even want to ? 
  i learned my most valuable lessons from this show : people with noses colored differently than the rest of their faces are [ bad people ] ( http://www.bestarabic.com/mall/image/cache/data/cartoons/kan3-500x500.jpg ) . 
  yo , danes , is this really true ? 
   the famous cykelslangen ( `` bike snake '' ) elevated bike ramp has captured the citizens ' imagination and provided an important mobility link across the harbor . 
  i could 've bet serious money on `` cykelslangen '' referring to the inner tube of the bike tire . 
   if you have decreasing returns to scale , an increment in size results in a decrease in efficiency . 
  that sounds like a really fancy way of saying `` it is what it is '' . 
   my question was more about what kind of possible properties of the finnish education system would have decreasing returns in scale ? 
  fyi the schools in the cities are generally larger and also have better grades . 
  the size of the classroom should n't be a factor . 
  we split up the students into pararell classes so as to keep the classrooms at a certain size . 
  more students in one school instead means more teachers ( usually ) . 
  same applies on a larger scale regarding children/school as well . 
  some schools will be bigger , and perhaps some new schools would be in order , i do n't know . 
  for reference * density of helsinki : ~ 3 000 people / km2 * density of london : ~ 5 400 people / km2 * density of england as a whole : 400 people / km2, 
  how would the size of the population affect the efficiency ? 
  ( i 'm genuinely curious ), 
  considering how easy it is to get a beer , i ca n't shake the feeling you just want to suck some dick . 
  i just wanted to tell you , you do n't have to make up reasons to do it . 
   he is a nobody and will probably be ejected from the party for this comment . 
  when do you reckon this will happen ? 
  it 's been a week now . 
  i 'm not sure why you are getting downvoted . 
  people did vote for this guy , this party is known for its xenophobia and for being `` everyday-joes '' . 
  a lot of the candidates presented by this party are also objectively out of their league when it comes to thinking on a macro scale . 
  their nimby - politics just mark them as morons . 
  spanish corruption !, 
  no wait , [ we did expect that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index#/media/file:transparency_international_2014.png ) . 
  i do n't know where / u/jms3r gets his machines , but at least the ones i 've seen typically come with instructions in all the nordic languages . 
  i can only imagine they 're produced somewhere far away , but packaged for the combined market of norway , sweden , finland , and denmark . 
  a fair point . 
  granted , hanna m\u00e4ntyl\u00e4 's comments about vaccine-scepticism is n't mentioned in the article linked by op , but that does n't make it any less true . 
  article in finnish : http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1425293447810, 
   nonetheless , the finns ' ministers actually exceeded my expectations same here , although i think that says more about our expectations than it does about the ministerial quality of the true finns . 
  ( i refuse to call them `` the finns '' , i find it too ambiguous in a context like this . ), 
  there are so many checks along the way that we will neither implement death penalty nor do away with vaccines , but this does give some insight into how unqualified some of the true finns - party members are . 
  also , if you do have any references that finns editorialize , please , do share . 
  western : portugal , spain , maybe france , perhaps some isles eastern : balticum , poland , belarus , ukraine , romania , buglaria , basically former sovjet union mostly northern : finland , sweden , norway , denmark ( barely ) , sometimes estonia , iceland , faroe islands southern : mediterranean countries from europe the rest would either be undefined or central europe . 
  tbh i do n't think i hear the term `` western europe '' that much . 
  eastern europe , sure . 
  but the only time i actually hear western europe is when someone paraphrases putin . 
  we just need to legalize it . 
  a lot of the older population still thinks weed is basically crack cocain . 
  no , just better than red bull . 
  our own energy drinks are actually good . 
  * sips battery *, 
  at 17 we were selling most of our product to altia . 
  their sovjet propaganda . 
  big fan . 
  big fan !, 
  valve had an event last summer sale that split the userbase into colored teams . 
  i had the fortune of ending up on team red , who had my favourite graphical profile ever . 
  ladies and gentlemen , all the way from the 80s sovjet russia , i give you , [ steam team red ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/steamteamred ) . 
  we need to have our nokia stores up and running and our rye bread in the shelves by the time [ we get the train tracks working ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica ) . 
  to be fair , the pictures are usually good . 
  not necessarily my cup of tea , i prefer more makeup and some fuckme-pumps , but the production value is high . 
  please do n't . 
  finland and norway will feel like the kids in a divorce . 
  =( edit : . . and i do n't think we 'll get the double birthday parties . 
  i hear you guys have your home address on some of your licenses . 
  what is that like ?
