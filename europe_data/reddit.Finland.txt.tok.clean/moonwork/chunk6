  i 'm a firm believer in gender equality , but i 'm very sceptical about these gender quotas . 
  just as i am about the `` gender neutral snow plowing '' ( which is everything but gender neutral ) . 
  i 'm glad sweden is acting as a test dummy for all these issues . 
  apparently some authorities decided that some residential areas somewhere are to be used as housing for immigrants and political refugees . 
  this decision led to the owner of the buildings to get rental payments from the state and to the current inhabitants to be evicted . 
  the man is raging about how the decisionmakers are making decisions that throw the citizens into the wind while catering for immigrants ; legal and illegal . 
  i have no idea how much of this is true , i have n't heard anything about this until i saw his rant . 
  i have a hard time believing that swedes , of all people , would throw anybody into the streets . 
  that swede is so angry he almost goes full dane . 
  i think / u/damir33 is making the argument that if you lived in norway , you would n't likely be making the same statements . 
  i guess the implication would be that you 'd know better . 
  in regards to pubs ( and other public places to watch ) , you might want to be more specific . 
  there 's way more differences between european countries than there are between the states in the states . 
  seems [ quite a few languages use that term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%b6rg%c3%a5sbord ) . 
  any statistics regarding choice of language and winning ? 
  i 'm willing to bet english songs have a higher win rate than the others combined . 
  we live next to russia . 
  i think you need to recalibrate your scale for crazy . 
  one word : boring . 
  i think we found a list where finland will never be in the top10 . 
  swedish has no space in compound words . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longest_words#swedish lists this word as an example : sp\u00e5rvagnsaktiebolagsskensmutsskjutarefackf\u00f6reningspersonalbekl\u00e4dnadsmagasinsf\u00f6rr\u00e5dsf\u00f6rvaltarens ( 95 letters ) while that could somewhat easily be lengthened with [ ... ] f\u00f6rvaltarvikariesjuksk\u00f6taruniformsansvarige and make it 127 letters . 
  the same can be said about finnish . 
  i do n't know if you deleted the details about your question , but here 's something : * [ campus gotland ] ( http://www.campusgotland.uu.se/en/studyhere/education/ ) * [ kymenlaakso university of applied sciences ] ( http://www.kyamk.fi/applying/bachelor%27s%20degree%20programmes/game%20design/ ) ( bachelors ) there 's also something in [ tampere university ] ( http://www.uta.fi/en/ ) , i just ca n't find anything on their pages . 
  reading through the replies , i do n't think mine would add to the diversity ( my opinions have already been expressed by others in several replies ) . 
  how do you , op , feel about the replies ? 
  did this help ? 
  can someone eli5 what human capital index actually means ? 
  i 'm not sure what we 're # 1 in this time . 
  there 's a war raging somewhere constantly . 
  do i want people to get killed ? 
  hell no . 
  do i feel like a war in the balkans would impact me more than a war in the middle east ? 
  hell no . 
  there 's so many thing to be afraid of and people die for stupid reasons around the world all the time . 
  that does n't mean i think people should carry on with aggression , it just means i do n't value the lives of one group of strangers over another . 
  sure . 
  i 'd list my fear of war in the balkans right above my fear of [ prickly sharks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prickly_shark ) and just under dysentery in india . 
  no , just . . just no . 
  i 'm checking your homework : * no homework - false * no tests - false * no grades - false , you 're thinking of sweden * leaning by discovery ? 
  - only in part i do n't know where you got this idea about schools in finland , but i do n't think you should rely on it as a source of information anymore . 
  what 's an expo ? 
  and why should i light a strangers car on fire because of it ? 
  so what are they rioting about , exactly ? 
  i googled #noexpo and found http://www.noexpo.org/english/ i read that page and the only thing i found with the slightest indication of what the fuck is going on , was `` since 2001 , the first of may in milan is mayday parade , the parade of the insurgent and queer precarious . '', 
  while `` the parade of the insurgent '' says absolutely nothing , `` queer precarious '' leaves me baffled . 
  do they mean `` bi-curious ? '', 
  can someone just tell me what exactly they 're demonstrating ? 
  and do the people in charge of italy know why they do this ? 
  because to me their message is really well hidden . 
  it 's like they just want to watch the world burn . 
   avengers 2 only now do i realize age of ultron * is actually avengers 2 * has already premiered in most countries in europe * will be released in the us on may 1st, 
  get your shit together !, 
  well can you blame him with that screen resolution ? 
  i 'm conflicted . 
  usually it 's just finland self-bashing . 
  this new-found attention is giving me a sense of belonging , but at the same time they 're taking our job , * and * we do n't really like being in the spotlight . 
  not shou emousshi\u00f6ns . 
  there 's a bit of stigma attached to it . 
  wikipedia says roughly 19 % of us smoke , which seems reasonable . 
  there 's a calm before a storm now , but , come summer , there will be massive debates again over smoking on the pub terraces . 
  in the winter we debate about smoking at bus stops . 
  very few people smoke indoors , and in those cases it 's usually in their own homes . 
  smoking has probably been reduced largely thanks to our somewhat stricts laws . 
  you have to know your brand when you purchase cigarrettes at a store , because it 's not legal to show them there anymore . 
  also there 's no smoking allowed in pubs and bars where servers work , so there 's usually a separate smoking room/area with no drinks allowed . 
  when i visit countries in central europe , i 'm always amazed at how many people there smoke . 
  fluent in * swedish * finnish * english speak a few words of : * norwegian * french understand some : * spanish * german would like to learn : * polish - i have polish friends i 'd like to be able to talk to in polish * dutch - same thing, 
  and nobody has had anything positive to say about them . 
  when someone does something with extreme conviction , there 's a saying we use : `` f\u00f6r kung och fosterland '' . 
  it lacks any deities , but i 'd like to think it 's the same expression . 
  we just use it with a more appropriate amount of sarcasm . 
  only once we 've successfully launched the finns onto a trajectory leading into a black hole . 
  until then we need all hands on deck so these nutjobs do n't ruin it for all . 
  his sawmill ( which he owns together with some relatives and is actually run by his brother ) [ saw some rough times and would not have made it through the recession if it was n't for eu-funding ] ( http://www.nelonen.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/239169-hakkaraisten-tulipalojen-koettelema-saha-hoipertelee-konkurssin-partaalla ) . 
  on his road to parliament , hakkarainen ran on populistic hate for eu-funding . 
  he may not be stupid , but in that case he hides that really well . 
  it 's not entirely unlikely that the sawmill is doing better now , in part , because of hakkarainen 's publicity . 
  also he appears to not give a shit about his voters , by making a complete ass of himself in parliament . 
  why this man got elected the first time is interesting , but him getting re-elected now is a fucking mystery . 
  stubb is n't even a member of sfp . . at least have them take his own party with him . 
   we have rising unemployment , but in the same we have highest number open position in uusimaa than there were in a record year of 2007 . 
  what that tells me is that we may have problem on ... a ) work being in other place than available workforce ; and b ) workforce not matching what is looked after ... 
  so perhaps we need someone to figure out where the workforce is , what jobs are available , and why these two are n't cancelling each other out . 
  is this about us needing more software designers ? 
   then , in the 1960s , researchers across the nordic countries started investigating how much punishment really helps reduce crime . 
  the conclusion : it does n't . 
  it 's ok . 
  the us is only roughly 50 years behind on this . 
  they 'll catch up at some point . 
   we have declining workforce while in the same time having an increase of social spending due to larger number of people not being part of the workforce . 
   but , we also have [ rising unemployment ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/unemployment_passes_10_mark/7885868 ) !, 
  if we are to increase immigration , we really need to make an effort to improve integration . 
  we should probably also make an effort to help highly educated immigrants get jobs within their field . 
  our doctors , engineers and lawyers are now driving buses and cleaning . 
  i guess that 's what you get when you invade parts of a country ; a resurgence in nationalism in said country . 
  so much hate . 
  . . and by gracing , you mean eviscerating , right ? 
  i must belong to the other half . 
  i 've never heard of / r/europe wanting the us to resolve it .
