  fyi those actors are actually irl [ father ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866918/ ) and [ son ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2762369/ ) . 
  just goes to show the terrorists ; it does not matter how you try to hurt france , in a few weeks they 'll bounce back and fight amongst themselves again !, 
  the only two words in this are `` gl\u00f6gg '' and `` prkl '' . 
  as a finnswede i approve of this . 
  oh , christians are second class citizens ? 
  then how are they treating people without imaginary friends ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i think it 's descpicable how they 're treating non-muslism . 
  i just think singling out a group like christians as a minority and doing a piece on how badly they have it is unhelpful at best and hypocritical at worst . 
  are you referring to op ( / u/twiiko ) or the mod ( / u/jebusgobson ) ? 
  i 'm so confused right now ... o_o, 
  i 'm sorry , but i honestly ca n't even find the word `` local '' on the rules page . 
  the only rules related to location i can find are * news content lacking context or basic information like what , when , where * non-european news and politics i 'm genuinely just curious . 
  what 's going on ? 
  what rule does this submission break ? 
   i understand why people are offended by my comparison of the movie and the current crisis , as the former is a question of good versus evil , while the latter most certainly is n't , but that is unfortunately how entertainment media works . 
  black and white is much more appealing to an audience than a bleak world of grey nuances . 
  it 's much easier to understand black and white than grey . 
  well , in all honesty , i think `` good vs evil '' is a simplified version of the warcraft event as well . 
  the only `` true evil '' here is the amount of warcraft spoilers in your post . 
   well , i , for one , found your allegory fascinating and insightful . 
  i thought you argued your case well . 
  but i also think this whole idea probably only appeals to people who are somewhat acquainted with the warcraft lore . 
  that 's a really awesome allegory !, 
  hang on , does that mean that putin is medivh ? 
  or is he sargeras ? 
  and does that mean that isis-daesh are the draenei ? 
  for the ones not in the know , the orcs did n't flee into azeroth like the refugees into europe . 
  the orcs invaded azeroth in hopes of an easy conquest . 
  so even if the orcs would fit to be an allegory for the refugees for the premise of this movie , in the long run they share more attributes with the current russian army forces . 
  the first warcraft game ( warcraft : orcs & humans ) came out 20 years ago ( nearly 30 years ago in warcraft universe time ) . 
  that 's basically the time where this movie is set ; the dark portal is opened and the orcs invade azeroth . 
  since then , there 's been no actual peace between the two factions ( horde & alliance ) , just 3 separate warcraft games , 6 expansions to said games , 5 books and a manga trilogy . 
  so when this movie ends , if there would be some form of peace between the humans & the orcs ( which i doubt ) , it would be an extremely strenuous peace . 
   besides , there is n't really that much of a story to go on , even with the books , so the writer are free to make any changes they like . 
  i do n't know how it is at the moment , but wowpedia was dubbed `` world 's second largest english wiki '' a few years ago . 
  warcraft is known for it 's immensive lore . 
  as far as video game movies go , warcraft quite certainly has the most to go on . 
  personally i 'm looking forward to see which storylines they 'll follow and if the war of the ancients - trilogy gets a tv show or something . 
  oh , and i hope the arthas storyline gets more focus than just a movie or two . 
  . . but . . why ? 
  this sounds like something that would happen at a bar around closing time . 
  are ukranian mps drunk in session ? 
  i think it 's absolutely awesome how all of the countries on the list actualy have a common unit for volume measurement , except for one , so that the one we 'll go with . 
  ( i realize it 's made for a us audience , but still . 
  in it 's current context , it becomes awesome . ), 
  i thought this an interesting and well-written article , until i came across this :  but it also is a country where some people pay more than 50 percent tax on incomes of 70,000 euros a year what ? 
  since when ? 
  i just used [ our official tax calculator ] ( http://www.vero.fi/veroprosenttilaskuri ) and fed in 300k $ and got a 47 % . 
  is bloombergview using somekind of special tax calculation that it just too complicated for me ? 
  i 'd like to think i 've opened doors in nearly any conceivable nordic environment . 
  not once have i had trouble closing a front door because of wind unless there 's been a cross draft . 
  when it 's cold , windy , or rainy , be quick in the door . 
  a much better solution than to make the door take up space inwards . 
  there 's a custom in upper-class homes to wear formal shoes indoors . 
  i 've been to such events and it 's always as confusing when you enter a home , start taking off your shoes and the host ( ess ) goes `` please , you can keep your shoes on . 
  come in ! '', 
  so yeah , it 's a thing in some places in finland . 
  and yes , it 's always annoying . 
  is that in a large city ? 
  or everywhere ? 
  why are you linking to slashdot ? 
  o_o [ direct link ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/kela_to_prepare_basic_income_proposal/8422295 ), 
   with 800 per month , you do n't pay shit in helsinki area . 
   that 's absolutely not true !, 
  i can nearly pay my entire rent with that money !, 
  denmark , we appreciate all that you 'd doing for the well-being of other european languages . 
  but perhaps you should stick to trying to insert some consonants into your own language ? 
  ^ ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ ^ borrow ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ poles ? 
  so far that i frown at your choice of the word `` ideal '' . 
  christianity does n't really have much of a track record with sexual minorities either . . 
  roughly as much as the holy trinity makes christianity polytheist . 
  i think that is treating the symptom rather than the disease , but unless someone has a cure or treatment for the disease , i guess that 's ok . 
  better not make this thread too epic . 
  would n't want sweden to close down more unis . . 
  awesome to have the pictures up , but it feels like the design is about the same age as the pictures . 
  a 0.7 l jack daniel 's bottle is 33.40 $ here . 
  the cab starting price is 5.90 $ during the day , and 9.00 $ during nights . 
  i do n't know how it is in latvia , but usually the cheaper a cab is , the more chances are the cab driver will want to take the scenery route . 
  most of my cab rides ( maybe 8-10 times a year ) here in finland , the driver uses the gps for the entire route , even when ( s ) he 's familiar with the destination . 
  at first , i thought you meant `` ridiculously cheap '' . 
  alright , so it 's anecdotal evidence , not prejudice . 
  i still think it would be beneficial for the discussion to provide references to actual research about thi , but , since i 'm getting downvoted for that , i guess the community has accepted your data . 
  unless you 've met a significant portion of all muslims in the world , that 's anecdotal evidence that means very little . 
  none of the muslims i 've met have ever said anything bad about jews . 
  and here i thought hatred towards entire groups of people was because of too little knowledge and too much xenophobia . 
  do you have any references to this `` most muslims do n't really like jews '' - claim ? 
  because it sounds like speculation and prejudice to me . 
  i 'm unsure of how much less sense that makes . 
  hang on , . . what ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure if by `` cry me a river '' you mean they deserve it or that the open hate towards jews in malm\u00f6 is just ok . 
  but either way , you motivate this by quoting a founding director of an educational organisation saying it 's happening because jews are about to lead europe into some form of a new era ? 
  how the fuck is it ok to treat other people like garbage just because there 's a school somewhere that promotes their culture ? 
  please tell me i just misunderstood you . 
  so what we need here is to get the saudi public informed on how people ought to treat one another . 
  sure , it would classify as propaganda , but the ultimate goal would be to stabilize the region by making them less violent and therefore give the citizens of saudi arabia more power . 
  so what we need first is one think tank to figure out what type of entertainment we should send them , and another to figure out a delivery system . 
  both think tanks should have people in them who are very familiar with saudi arabian culture , preferably locals . 
  they ca n't behave like reasonable people ? 
  we 'll branwash them to behave like reasonable people !, 
  who 's with me ?
