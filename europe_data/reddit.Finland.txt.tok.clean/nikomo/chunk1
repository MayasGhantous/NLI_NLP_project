windows 8.1 for gaming pc , linux or linux-based for everything else . 
  debian server , debian laptop , pi running raspbian for gpio usage ... android phone , android tablet . 
  the part that is cut off is the part that handles the self-cleaning of the penis . 
  being mutilated does n't make it easier to be clean , it just means you 're going to get an infection easier if you skip the shower in the morning . 
  also , i do n't recall seeing any scientific proof for the std part . 
  also , personal preference . 
  though i 'd rather have a life partner that is n't obsessed with a small piece of skin i may or may not have . 
  who won the knife round ? 
  your argument can be turned around and used on the snowden situation . 
  things are not that black and white , and this is a slightly complex problem . 
  i do n't really care much about this , even though it would probably boost business , and thus improve my quality of life . 
  but the name of the tunnel . 
  i want it to happen just because of that . 
  the opposite of the right side . 
  the cold war never ended , not in the minds of the people . 
  you 're here to stir shit up , instead of having a conversation , which contributes absolutely nothing . 
  with an asshole in charge . 
  the ceo was n't given the job by nokia , the shareholders forced him into that position . 
  it 's a real problem with publicly traded companies . 
  how is a hostile-to-developers , restricted piece of shit `` a better platform '' ? 
  you ca n't get any source code for the important parts of the system , and last time i checked , you had to pay for a developer license to properly own your device . 
  partnering with non-finnish companies , but in some cases , foreigners can also be considered a threat , especially if they 're high-up in the corporate ladder , if we 're talking about a big company . 
  5-10 % in smartphones , if you look at all phones , it 's a blip in the radar , nothing more . 
  nokia did n't partner with microsoft , the microsoft insider that was placed into nokia by foreign owners gave the company to microsoft . 
  the entire nokia deal has bred more xenophobia regarding doing business with foreigners than anything else i 've seen . 
  so , what you 're saying is , the offspring of organisms will be different , no matter what . 
  the entire concept of organisms not changing is so stupid to me , i ca n't come up with a good analogy for explaining how stupid denying evolution is . 
  how about a mirror ? 
  genetic change during reproduction is basically the key to evolution , so if evolution does n't exist or whatever it is that they claim , a boy should look exactly the same as his father , and a girl should look exactly like her mother . 
  finland warns russia against opening its mouth . 
  nothing specific comes to mind , because i literally did n't care back when it happened . 
  i do recall national media crying about it for months on end though , but that was right around the time i disconnected myself the national media , and tv , so i never read more than headlines , and heard the occasional complaining about it on the tv if i was near one . 
  then we had to host eurovision because we won , and we found out how much hosting the damn thing costs , so we 've been too scared to send out any real competition after that . 
  eat some fresh asphalt , pretty much the same thing . 
  he is mostly thinking about the online gamers of brazil , who are notorious for ruining literally every online multiplayer game ever invented . 
  windows provides prng functions that are basically the same as what you get on linux . 
  i will say though , i like the linux method of having a blocking pool that gets entropy from the system , and a non-blocking pool that is seeded from the blocking pool , so if you just need some random numbers for a dice game , you can grab the cryptographically weak numbers from the non-blocking pool , but if you need to do some serious crypto , you can read from the blocking pool , consume all the bits there until it 's empty , wait for the system to gather more , use them up again etc. 
  until you 're done . 
  do n't know how windows handles that stuff , do n't really care , i do n't trust windows to handle anything important . 
  from what i heard , the brazil deal died because they had a joint project with some other nation for a weapons system , and it was easier to just start using the same planes that the other nation was using , and there was some other stuff too . 
  this , however . 
  an intelligence satellite , with a us backdoor , is kind of stupid and worthless . 
  fine . 
  as a human being , i do not need your permission to speak my mind . 
  as an atheist , i do not require your , or anyone else 's , permission to speak . 
  the isp is no longer a dumb pipe at that point with content filtering even being available , ** which they 're supposed to be . 
  ** oh and the fact that an abusive parent can setup the block list and enable the option to block websites which are meant to help kids who are being abused . 
  i really hope finland throws away pretty much every single piece of government-related software , and just begs estonia for what they have . 
  we used the american method of doing government work , which means ask for bids on a contract , and hire the most ... affordable ( shittiest ) people to work on it , and then be surprised when shit does n't work , and goes overbudget , and we have to pay for it because the contract did n't specify that the company building the solution would be in charge of everything going over the budget . 
  you should try being a finn who has gone through the mandatory forced swedish lessons . 
  i recognize the configuration of the letters , but they do n't form anything coherent . 
  a lot of people actually still managed to scribble it in there . 
  which means that they both knew where finland was , and that they cared enough to write it down . 
  we can start with that . 
  sure , as long as you understand the concept of personal space . 
  ** finland ** * [ we 're running out of smart people . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/400-page_research_report_finland_has_a_mental_sustainability_gap/6921588 ) * [ foreigners found a bread commercial funny . 
  ] ( http://depressingfinland.tumblr.com/post/65411926403/finnish-bread-advertisement-hinted-to-me-by ) good week for finland . 
  actually it 's just that we refuse to acknowledge swedish as a language , and swedes as humans . 
  because it is n't , and they are n't , and fuck them . 
   when has another language ever been a burden ? 
  when it uses up valuable hours that could be spent learning something actually useful ? 
  not to forget , we already have another language , ** english ** . 
  on grades 7 through 9 , we 're talking about what , 2 hours a week or something ? 
  you could easily throw those into physics and chemistry , they could use them . 
  or maybe we could combat health problems through either giving pe teachers a massive 4-hour chunk , where they could actually travel from the school to somewhere , do physical exercises for 3 hours , and get back to school/end the school day , or give them 2 2-hour time allocations every week , maintaining steady exercise throughout the week . 
  or you could spend it on reworking our it education , going through microsoft office for 3 years is bloody useless , have some simple programming lessons , working at a problem like that helps with logical thinking and problem-solving skills . 
  or you could give more time to the freely selectable stuff , like home economy . 
  then again , back when i picked the longer home economy , we had quite a bit of time on our hands there , so maybe not . 
  there 's so much to learn , it enrages me that we 're wasting these resources on bullshit because of old people going `` ha , i do n't have to do that , fuck you '' . 
  i propose that uk shuts up and thinks before speaking . 
  politicians that had enough balls to finally get rid of mandatory swedish . 
  it 's easy to dance around the problem when you 're 50 + years old and you do n't have to worry about education when you 're a well-off politician with a steady career , but what about people who have to deal with this shit ? 
  you could n't vote through the app ? 
  the voting cost money no matter what you used to vote . 
  in finland , phonecall cost 1 $ , sms cost 1 $ and voting with the app cost 1 $, 
  if you go through finland 's history of songs , you can spot one really annoying phenomenon . 
  lordi wins -  we find out how much money it costs to host the fucking thing , and how annoying tourists are -  never sending anyone with any real chance to win , ever again . 
  soon , all swedes living in finland will finally be able to marry . 
  developed . 
  i 'm going to assume being a student does n't count as being unemployed . 
  going through this thread confirmed something for me : i 'm not the only finn who thinks there 's nothing worth watching on the tv . 
  when are we getting our money back ? 
  arrrrrrrrrrr, 
  my temperature scale 's a bit off compared to other people anyways . 
  optimal outside temperature for me is somewhere around -2 and +3 -4 , so i can layer clothing but open and close the layers to control temperature . 
  going colder than that is fine too , because i just get to have more layers to control . 
  i 've been wearing a very , very light jacket in the morning since i 'm on a bicycle , and windchill is a bitch . 
  but i 've had to take the jacket off when i come back because the sun might be out , and even if it 's not , it 's still too damn hot . 
  we 're incapable of taking in that many immigrants , there 's a reason we set up quotas for refugees , we do n't have the resources ( not just economical , i 'm talking about housing , education etc. ), 
  to take in more people than the quotas . 
  sweden is already bursting at the seams from all the economic immigrants , so you also have a problem . 
  the immigrants want to live in the city , not in the middle of the forests , and you do n't have enough housing in cities to provide that . 
  i have nothing against the refugees that make their way to a refugee camp and then apply for asylum in an eu country that way . 
  those people go through the correct channels , and if those channels let `` undesired '' ( your one in a billion chance of letting an actual terrorist in the country ... 
  etc. ), 
  people into our country , that 's our mistake . 
  if sweden was n't helping them unlawfully enter finland , i doubt it would be such a hot topic . 
  normally you might have a small trickle of people entering , but opening the floodgates brought attention . 
  the performance that taught us how much it costs to host the damn thing , and why we should never even try to win ever again .
