  [ kalevala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevala ) and its long story . 
  `` the chronology of this oral tradition is uncertain . 
  the oldest themes ( the origin of earth ) have been interpreted to have their roots in distant , unrecorded history and could be as old as 3,000 years . 
  [ 18 ] the newest events ( e.g. 
  the arrival of christianity ) seem to be from the iron age . 
  finnish folklorist kaarle krohn proposes that 20 of the 45 poems of the kalevala are of possible ancient estonian origin or they at least deal with a motif of estonian origin ( of the remainder , two are ingrian and 23 are western finnish ) . 
  no , not migrant but `` asylum seekers '' .

  finns , fu russia and gib back our soil . 
  easilly defendable areas near old border in leningrad area and finnish areas easily defendendable areas in others . 
  you forgot you were killing finns in those areas and did after war . 
  but about leningrad . 
  establishment [ edit ] the 4th panzer group from east prussia took pskov following a swift advance and managed to reach novgorod by 16 august . 
  the soviet defenders fought to the death , despite the german discovery of the soviet defence plans on an officer 's corpse . 
  after the capture of novgorod , general hoepner 's 4th panzer group continued its progress towards leningrad . 
  [ 26 ] however , the 18th army -- despite some 350,000 men lagging behind -- forced its way to ostrov and pskov after the soviet troops of the northwestern front retreated towards leningrad . 
  on 10 july , both ostrov and pskov were captured and the 18th army reached narva and kingisepp , from where advance toward leningrad continued from the luga river line . 
  this had the effect of creating siege positions from the gulf of finland to lake ladoga , with the eventual aim of isolating leningrad from all directions . 
  the finnish army was then expected to advance along the eastern shore of lake ladoga . 
  [ 27 ] finland 's role in operation barbarossa was laid out in hitler 's directive 21 , `` the mass of the finnish army will have the task , in accordance with the advance made by the northern wing of the german armies , of tying up maximum russian ( sic - soviet ) strength by attacking to the west , or on both sides , of lake ladoga '' after the war , ryti stated : `` on august 24 , 1941 i visited the headquarters of marshal mannerheim . 
  the germans aimed us at crossing the old border and continuing the offensive to leningrad . 
  i said that the capture of leningrad was not our goal and that we should not take part in it . 
  mannerheim and the military minister walden agreed with me and refused the offers of the germans . 
  the result was a paradoxical situation : the germans could not approach leningrad from the north ... '' in fact the german and finnish armies maintained the siege together until january 1944 , but there was little , or no systematic shelling or bombing from the finnish positions . 
  [ 21 ] mannerheim had spent most of his career in the imperial russian army stationed at old st. 
  [ 46 ] the proximity of the finnish positions -- 33 -- 35 km ( 21 -- 22 mi ) from downtown leningrad -- and the threat of a finnish attack complicated the defence of the city . 
  at one point the defending front commander , popov , could not release reserves opposing the finnish forces to be deployed against the wehrmacht because they were needed to bolster the 23rd army 's defences on the karelian isthmus . 
  [ 47 ] mannerheim terminated the offensive on 31 august 1941 , when the army had reached the 1939 border . 
  popov felt relieved , and redeployed two divisions to the german sector on 5 september . 
  finns stopped in old border and didnt close blockade and didnt attack leningrad . 
  you know border what russians under false pretense stole from us . 
  ah , leningrad where finns allowed it to live by stopping and leaving supply corridors and that under germans telling to close it ... leningrad is and was russian city what exterminated finns who lived in there . 
  in name it may have been somekind of capital but not for finns .

   did hitler demand any concessions regarding jews from finland ? 
  they asked about jew problem and finns replied that here is no jew problem . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_wilhelm_rangell during reichsf\u00fchrer-ss heinrich himmler 's state visit to finland in august 1942 , rangell silenced himmler 's questions concerning the jewish minority of finland by famously stating : `` wir haben keine judenfrage '' ( `` we do not have a jewish question '' ),
