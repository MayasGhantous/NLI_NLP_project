  the effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined . 
  and it 's not just that we do n't trust people who are not like us . 
  in diverse communities , we do n't trust people who do look like us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal  in september 2012 , investigations by the times based on confidential police and social services documents , found that abuse had been much more widespread than acknowledged . 
  [ 23 ] [ 24 ] it uncovered systematic sexual abuse of white girls by british asian men ( mostly of pakistani origin ) [ 25 ] in rotherham for which people were not being prosecuted . 
  yes it is . 
  i mean its that painted by media etc. 
  everything what is not pro mass immigration is outright racism . 
  reasonable means `` immigration is enrichment '' `` you cant stop it '' . 
  all glory to [ arvo ylpp\u00f6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arvo_ylpp%c3%b6 ), 
  tell them go to public as in papers . 
  living next to sweden and i have followed scene over decade its different what you say in private but dare to go public . 
  depends who you got against , vocal gets antifa and youre fucked no matter what you say or how you articulate it . 
  youre nazi . 
  i dont see that as cold at all , would he wanted others to stop doing what he loved and they love just because he died doing it ? 
  heat and cold for his honour , another has gone and slowly generations change but thousands of years of tradion continues . 
  if you dare to say there is any problem in immigrant groups what is not because of swedes oppress then you are nazi . 
  [ no its normal day .

  [ finnish police study . 
  ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/152441 ) from page 28 - graph shows real level , sex , age and sex , income age and sex . 
  area income age and sex `` leveled '' . 
  dunno how to translate `` is taken in account '' a. violent crime b. rapes c. violent robberies d. robberies and as you can see while age etc. 
  do explain some differences for rape its 12x with african , middle-east and north africa ... 
  yes . 
  hills . 
  try sauna , its great . 
  you want to sauna with me and talk about this , its something new to me . 
  and to get you and not attack you you should make and eat https://corneliuswaldner.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/food-porn-veriletut-finnish-blood-pancakes/ thats great . 
  was it beer grapes , we have still laws about those . 
  offtopic but best i have heard is '' oe saatanan perkeleen jeesuksen perkeleen jumalan vittujen helevetti '' so `` devil , devil , jesus , devil , god , cunt , hell '' how i can use this elaborate way to express myself in english :d, 
  its old word and means god of something , because of cristianity it means devil but we do still use it . 
  its like `` fuck !!! '', 
  when you hit your toe . 
  get your `` things that you can stab at '' !, 
  look at finland , i couldnt even find my home because nordic circle is fucked up and were lived here permanently with owning land since 1630 . 
  you have to ask mapmaker but hes dead , what you think ? 
   they got annihilated by the romans , as was tradition at the time . 
  ( or it was because we were too north , over sea , sauna dwelling people with bad attitude about foreigners but i prefer strong . ), 
  baguette ? 
  its bollocks , [ here is map of finland from 1664 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/grand_duchy_of_finland_1662.jpg ) op : s map dont even have arctic circle right . 
  its curse word as `` oh my god '' or `` goddammit '' is . 
  cristians changed it from pray to curse . 
  to me it looks healthy and fluff , i have seen worst . 
  offtopic but whats growing behind fox ? 
  there is russian video about man dying for it , wasnt nice to watch so google if you really want . 
  but anyway if you are bitten by animal what may have rabies there is cure , just dont wait symptoms because then youre dead . 
  -30 c here , cant use for beer . 
  so where is our mountain !, 
  that doesnt mean they dont know , just that they cant prove . 
  in finland we have had proper registers since forever . 
  i can track my forefathers to 1630 and if i can be arsed to look where they moved from i probably can track them way back . 
  turkey needs churches , 
    burning building . 
  triggered , regards finnish lapland . 
  kemij\u00e4rvi dialect , still used . 
  atleast in my dialect area `` kraana '' is used and `` hana '' is proper word for it . 
  do we talk about [ this ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1198,h_674,q_70/13-3-5000293.jpg ) ? 
  `` pats viro '' my finnic brother , you are good boy . 
  russia has almost always had very high education what we finns have to admit even if we love to [ make fun of you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9klbmnbsnq ) . 
  [ according to calculator ] ( http://www.moisio.fi/taivas/?paikka=kemij%c3%a4rvi&amp;dy=06&amp;mn=12&amp;yr=oy+f ) suns up 10:45 and down 13:27 and between those its 1:44 h under 6 horizon so dim ... 
  snow makes all better tho so not that dark what you think but still . 
  look at summer too tho , sun rises x and sets month later , 
  < insert here ages old rant about how finns are everywhere in internet  and if you find it i would like to know , 
  it was actually outlawed because some died . 
  suolle means `` to the swamp '' in finnish , 
   intrestingly enough , there was an askreddit thread about personal experiences with him . 
  most of them were positive . 
  seller is always seem to be positive and nice . 
  i tend to judge by actions . 
  you dont really think your own place names till you try to translate those . 
  `` oh thats `` place of stick ( as a pointy thing ) '' ( puikkola ) and its in `` large village '' ( isokyl\u00e4 ) and leads to `` rocky hill '' ( kyr\u00f6vaara ) ... wtf and thats from where i am and happily tell people im from `` dry/hard/not farmable lake '' ( kemij\u00e4rvi ) . 
  people seems to tend to describe land/area and some just stick as name and in time while meaning of words just change names of places just stick . 
  in my example kyr\u00f6 and kemi dont mean anything anymore . 
  if you think about it there is at least million finns plus people pro finnish in sweden . 
  swedes do care . 
  finns use unused `` finns in sweden '' card , finns in sweden look swedes badly . 
  swedes back up because they dont want to hurt any feelings . 
  now that were here we need to discuss about fucked up border from 18th century , 
  descendant of haccapelites then , 
  if you look linguistic maps in [ subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/ ) you see we are related somehow . 
  it doesnt mean blood relative tho , language can be spread withouth changing population but its something . 
  i think you are finns who decided that cold weather wasnt nice and went to south , 
  alcoholism . 
  most common homicide is `` after weeks of drinking because of stupid fight by kitchen knife between middle aged alcoholics . '', 
  common man is safe . 
  finns have lot of vocals and [ haccapelites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) were used in polish-swedish wars . 
  [ no its not . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5p5j_k0csy ), 
  [ we know your stuff !, 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_sky ) i do recommend watching iron sky  and cant wait iron sky 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znifyy3i_1i, 
  that tv mast where it hit is 327 high so thats huge . 
  perfection, 
  main thing is no , it varies how much it changes sentence . 
  like taloniko cant be talokoni . 
  ( - ni - ko ownership and question , koni is old `` useless '' horse ) ( my house ? 
  vs houses horse who is seen its best days ) i just know how to speak so i assume no you cant but in some cases it may be acceptable . 
  i was never good in motherlanguage or any other language . 
  to have is `` omistaa '' what is `` to own '' . 
  sounds bit weird and is only used in official stuff .
