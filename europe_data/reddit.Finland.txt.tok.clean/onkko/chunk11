  actually i cant remember if ownership was directly said if not in argue like `` not in my house '' . 
  we dont really have different word for it just suffixes to words . 
  so - ni is closest , 
   over rus , not europe , rus . 
  lies , its ven as tribe . 
  ask finns they know why its ven\u00e4j\u00e4 , 
  google translate  `` all the women and ladies who are subject to us under vyborg , or in the karelian country , to be living in a married life , widows , patrons or virgins , must enjoy full peace and security , as well as our own kingdom in sweden , so that the offenders will meet our royal punishment with the most severe . '', 
  im proud fingol !, 
  yes i know its not true , 
  jesus came and paid our sins , fullfilled old oath , all sins of our forefathers what were reason of old testament torments . 
  new pact was made . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_covenant there seems to be differences and im not cristian but in name so i dont know but this seems to be belief in here . 
  dont quote old testament and wait to be taken seriously by most of population . 
   i mean , maybe 10 million would be too much . 
  but nobody 's mentioned 10 million , because we 're only talking about the present . 
  there is no limit , i mean literally there is no limit , as many as can can come and ask asylum . 
  if ngos can just transport people we are talking millions . 
  they try to safe lives but in meantime they create disaster . 
  more probable to survive with minimal price more comers there are . 
  less successful/pricier way is less people even try . 
  there is millions of comers if we allow people like msf to transport them . 
  dunno about verbs and stuff but we do have `` talossani '' in my house , `` talossasi '' in your house , `` taloissamme '' in our houses etc. 
  moomin is . 
  old testament is only history , jesus came and abolished old laws . 
  i dont make rules . 
  dont shoot the messenger . 
  so you call my personal experiences untrue ... 
  [ this is example of tatar in finland . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlnzuiog1uk ) she isnt killed or shunned . 
  just praised as actress . 
  no they arent , they are killed or assaulted if they do . 
  and they dont know better . 
  because most of them are ? 
   much like you can find people who call themselves catholic or christian while only maybe going to church once a year out of obligation  or as in finland , christening , confirmation , marriage , burial of family member/friend so depends how big your family is  cristening is done in homes tho but there is pastor . 
  last time in church was burial of my granmas brother few years ago . 
  well strictly speaking yes it means . 
  man can marry cristian if cristian converts and woman cant marry cristian.thats if you look quran and hadiths . 
  some populations dont follow stright stuff and best example is finnish jew [ zyskowitch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ben_zyskowicz ) who is married with tatar rahime husnetdin-zyskowicz fun thing is i have always check [ how to spell that name ] ( http://hikipedia.info/wiki/kuinka_monella_tapaa_zyskowiczin_voi_kirjoittaa_v%c3%a4%c3%a4rin%3f ) because it sounds like tsytskovits . 
  http://areena.yle.fi/1-1931339 only latin radio news i know , 
  seems you angried [ ukko ylijumala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukko ) . 
  dont do that . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arkxcitzoyq this is more current . 
  swedish names ? 
  old finnish names i say  we were under swedish rule about 600 years so names change , more or less voluntarily . 
  churches tend to change names to swedish ones and in [ 1906 ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%b6rfinskning ) and 1935 we show you big mid finger . 
  ways before you had to speak swedish and probably have swedish name to have any kind of position of power . 
  remember that finnish wasnt official language of finland but swedish was . 
  few my family died it wars . 
  http://kronos.narc.fi/menehtyneet/ only few are closely related , one is my granmas brother . 
  i dont know my father side . 
  http://kronos.narc.fi/menehtyneet/index.php?kunta=0904&amp;haekaikki=0&amp;sort=kaikki&amp;sivulle=100&amp;tulosta=1 this is list of our small village . 
  all listed here are probaby some kind of relation to me . 
  actually they are vikings so ... , 
  seems to be 4 about hour long parts . 
  i went weird part of youtube and found this and i thought its my part for 100 years celebration to share this , 
  shitload of our country is lakes , just put trees in between ? 
  old soil from water is excellent for trees , [ most of our comes from sea . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/08/why_sea_level_is_falling_in_finland_and_sweden.html ), 
  you added and removed letters , its suomi , 
  according to actors and credits somewhere around early 90s, 
  my city limit starts about 40km away . 
  and my city has about 7,6 k, 
  they are invaders , no question on that . 
  they were not asked nor wanted.sure they do n't either ask or want but that wont change it . 
  it perfect in finnish , 
  i was wrong , its viro , latvia , liettua . 
   pronunciation its perfect , 
  i know its under liettua . 
  peloton is finnish and means fearless , that horse was one , 
  i think they have way better climate than finns . 
  which one is country . 
  actually it was pre cristianity and only because it helped on what pre cristian people , and cristian people , i would use today but only on harvest . 
  source , i have been in helping on harvest and shit went on hair . 
  thats to easier to deport if found something fishy . 
  i really dont know . 
  do they really think someone would seriously tell `` payment for 100g of heroin '' in info field ... 
  its nice [ 25c ] ( http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/saa/kemij%c3%a4rvi ) ( my own temp meter says 25c ) in here north now , best weather in this summer . 
  32c would be too much . 
  only time i thought weather is unbearable was 1999 with week of about -45 c and min -55 c ( -67 f ) . 
  `` and again no problems in metal summer concert . 
  police had nothing to do '' . 
  general headline in news . 
  from my personal experience they yell `` moottorisahalla perseeseen , veri lent\u00e4\u00e4 taivaaseen '' and same time they are respectable and helpful bunch of people . 
  finland rises from sea so they are `` soon '' mainland finland , 
  finland actually has [ metal masses ] ( https://youtu.be/c7ypymty8-q?t=288 ) , maybe vatican could follow example :d, 
  why ? 
  it didnt work so its scrapped . 
   not sure what 's the point tbh , it 'd take literally a second to google it . 
  to you it takes second , to lot of people its new that police is in internet . 
  we in here are probably upper 10 % or something in usage of internet etc. 
  while police serve even dumbest fuck who dont know what browser is and searching something is unheard `` i just use facebook and news site '' . 
  https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/152441 bigger pdf page 28 onwards , lowest yellow bar is age/gender/area / income normalized level . 
  like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/i_rnfshrudu?t=445 ), 
  own sauna is always better but public is enjoyable too . 
  well you have dracula to take care of . 
  i dont blame anything and by finland i mean country not individuals . 
  its just general policy what moved us from agriculture to what we are now . 
  you mean you have n't seen most of your close family naked ? 
  [ no you havent ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/central-american-immigrants-united-states ), 
  we still are , i look like italian when i take enough sun tho ,
