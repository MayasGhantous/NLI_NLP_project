  and in northern finland germans helped us to get rid of old buildings . 
  [ supo \\ ( finnish security intelligence service \\ ) ] ( http://www.supo.fi/counterterrorism/terrorism_threat_assessment ) says  the finnish security intelligence service ( supo ) has around 350 counterterrorism target individuals . 
  the number of target individuals has risen especially in the last few years and increased by circa 80 % since 2012 . 
  this trend is assessed to go on , as a consequence of radicalisation and detection of new networks . 
  in addition to the increase in number , the links of target individuals to terrorist activity are also more direct and more serious than before . 
  an increased number of them has either taken part in an armed conflict , expressed willingness to participate in armed activity , or received terrorist training . 
  16.4 1904 [ eugen schauman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugen_schauman ) shot [ nikolay bobrikov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolay_bobrikov ) . 
    schauman became something of an icon for the resistance to imperial russia and many finns still consider him a hero . 
  his fame can be characterized by his ranking as the 34th greatest finn of all time in the suuret suomalaiset ( greatest finns ) television poll . 
  in the place of the assassination in the hallway of the council of state there is a memorial plaque that states se pro patria dedit ( he gave himself for his country ) .

  atleast you get night , i dont . 
  seems i have been victim of fake video , i looked short part of it and while it sounded odd it seemed plausible . 
  yours is real and i really do enjoy how they can be nationalistic and party in finnish way  also i have that i `` understand '' language but next i think i have a stroke because `` no fuck i dont understand anything but they are speaking finnish '' before i understand its estonian . 
  fuck estonian language . 
  its not estonia , its viro ffs !, 
  viromaa would be probably acceptable . 
  yes i know its only one part of country but we named you thousand years ago so it sticks !, 
  `` hi im deutchland '' `` fuck you , you came from saxon area so now you are saksa . 
  also we used your swords for model for scrissors so they are called sakset . '', 
  `` hi im sweden '' `` fuck you , you came from roslagen or was it rowing , dunno but you are ruotsi '' etc  [ viro ei ole kirosana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmqdmq9818 ), 
  checked swedish speakers and `` swedish 289,540 '' so biggest language group by huge number but ... as you said , 
  odd when [ finnish statistics ] ( http://www.stat.fi/index_en.html ) offers population by whatever you want to look  http://www.stat.fi/til/vaerak/tau_en.html and look how many 30-34 year old woman urdu speakers are in county or whatever you want to see . 
  i used `` nationality according to age and sex by region 1990 - 2016 '', 
  it has been meme at least a decade or two . 
  could n't find original but that was guy who was upset that where ever he goes in internet there are finns.i remember they did some elaborate conspiracy theory why its so  but yes finns are everywhere in internet . 
  i have had internet about 17 years and i think its basic human right ( goverment think so too ) so internet for everyone !, 
  [ we actually did that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence )  finland provided 5000 rifles and 20 field guns by 12 december . 
  finland also sent 3500 volunteers . 
  pohjan pojat led by hans kalm fought at the southern front , including at the battle of paju , while i suomalainen vapaajoukko led by martin ekstr\u00f6m fought at the viru front , including at the battle of utria . 
  finnish volunteers returned to finland on march -- april 1919 , having lost 150 men . 
  more than booze , we did help to beat russians  i watched documentary about [ `` tribe wars '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heimosodat ) and apparently battle hardened finnish troops helped a lot . 
  [ i watched that documentary again ] ( http://areena.yle.fi/1-1047792 ) ( nsfl because of pictures of mass graves ) and 1/3 of estonian army in 1919 was finnish and `` drinked a lot but were cabable to serve '' and `` stationary war caused drinking problems and misbehaviour '' `` new batch of finns were brought but after 5 days of drinking in tallin and shooting `` sergeant major '' they were send to south '' :d fug :d so there was booze involved , 
  finland is wrong , swedes are 5th and way behind estonians and russians .

  early finnish sakset do look like dual saxon swords . 
  did you know that potatoes were brought by german tinkerers . 
  wealthy people supported potatoes and made example how to use potatoes . 
  thats how we be potato loving country . 
  germany is saksa in finnish , and scissors are sakset . 
  both names come from saxons . 
  portukali , thats how its pronounced because fuck foreign letters ,
