  look iso viha and pieni viha when about shitload of us were killed or taken as slaves . 
  in finnish apple tree is literal `` omenapuu '' , probably because we really didnt have those and today its for rich to show off in their garden . 
  now add pizza to it , its great you uncultured swines !, 
  alma in finnish is old female name . 
  so finnish bosses are drunkards , explains a lot : o, 
  fucking iranians , who told its omena !, 
  and why you do n't use it anymore !, 
  you probably can see im not serious but i know internet so im not serious , im proud of my odd language . 
  actually its nice to see old connections like these and ponder where those came . 
  so who indo-iranian told to proto finns what apple is ? 
  `` perhaps a loan from an indo-iranian language into proto-finnic . 
  related to estonian \u00f5un . '', 
  i blame vikings or similar before them . 
  proto-finnic was thousands of years ago so where and why !, 
  its not like we just went to holiday there . 
  were there one iranian with apples who travelled here and if then why he did that or were there finn who went there and came back and why !, 
  we will never know !, 
  in finnish pomo means boss . 
  can affirm , today i had to fight against freezing moist wind while i went to shop and i said `` fuck this summer '' while i entered to shop and atleast 2 old ladies gave eye on me and one teen almost laughed at me when i had to clean my glasses :(, 
  your phobias are n't valid reason . 
   the origin of the sauna is a hot issue , both finland and sweden claim it is its invention . 
  no its not , its clearly finnish and there is no debate about it . 
  its saatana and to add `` vittujen perkeleen saatanan helevetin vittuuuuuuuu !!!! '', 
  is proper way to yell when you hit your toe . 
   ( i 'm looking at you `` pit\u00e4\u00e4 '' , grrrr ... ) to keep or to like , wont you want to keep what you like , 
  and we here lapland have `` witches ocean '' :d, 
  thousands of lakes , so more than thousand , 
   are fins really that cold , loner-ish and emotionally dinstant from each other ? 
  not really , it takes time warm but when we do you have friend for life . 
  and we arent really emotionally distant , we just dont show that so much or in ways you would wait . 
  imagine that you that you see old friend after decades , finn would say `` hi , where you fuctard have been '' and everything continues like nothing has happened . 
  of course there would be some `` oh this my wife '' and slowly tell what have happened but their friendship is still intact . 
  its not that affectionate or anything like south but pat in your back is way more than affectionate hug and family emergency . 
  different culture , different ways . 
  humanity is same . 
  on topic , because all of this pula snickering , fun fact pula in finnish means shortage . 
  because getting pregnant again too soon is not good but sex is . 
  mostly south , you have drive few km to north to get in circle . 
  [ where words doesnt help you need nokian rubber baton ] ( http://www.saasta.fi/saasta/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/pamppu11.png ), 
  its from mauno to tellervo koivisto area , thats worst !, 
  we have similar odd stone stuff , aligned to sun and moon . 
  its not like someone just decided to build fortress . 
  of course we have fortresses too on top on of hills etc. 
  my summer cabin is 15km from my house . 
  [ this is finnish smile ] ( http://www.esaimaa.fi/f/1/15/small_22256820.jpg ), 
  to me he looks like someone who is focused on task , not sad . 
  and he is our beloved long time president who just passed away . 
  he thinks every pic in paper has to be overly happy . 
  thats old man carefully driving and i dont see him as unhappy , just careful . 
  he may give bit of smirk when hes done but thats something only finn could see , 
  irish should know norfians , they came in boats and settled in area where sun doesnt shine , 
  i have seen documentary called planet of apes and gorilla warfare looks like terrifying : o, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock it is popularly referred to as military time in the united states [ 4 ] and a handful of other countries [ 1 ] where the 12-hour clock is still dominant . 
  while his movies are exaggerated he is not totally wrong , 
  its military time !, 
  we dont really use am/pm . 
  its sleeping on rock now !, 
  stay near home ? 
  if you show your happiness or brag about it can be taken from you . 
  according to some article i red that was old belief what still effects on culture . 
  of course its hard to see in picture , i would need video but probably thats old , happy , man showing his neat new toy for reporter while telling `` this is not really much , something i like to do on my spare time '' while enthusiastically driving aroung , 
  i cant even run half marathon , i can walk it probably in 4 hours . 
  and individual , i have never had problems to sleep in summers . 
  black thick trash bags and ducttape !, 
  only few euros , 
  for some it does affect but not to me . 
  and there are ways to block sun so bedroom is dark . 
  where i live in 2 weeks starts 1 month long day , 
  [ yes ] ( https://youtu.be/8dkdewkaolc?t=442 ) . 
  we have best pizza !, 
  regards few years ago when we won  finns know pizza and pineapple is part of it !, 
  kinkku , salami , ananas , aurajuusto is best pizza !, 
  its not anti-swedish , it just sounds and looks like my dialect so if there is me\u00e4nkieli then there should be `` kemij\u00e4rvikieli '' . 
  or divide all dialects as their own language . 
  thats because they thought it was better than telling its finnish . 
  me\u00e4nkieli is basically dialect i speak with few more swedish loan words , its political and never been anything else . 
  swedes just didnt want to admit that in north finns were `` indeginous '' people so they invented new `` language '' . 
  easier than giving rights to finns . 
  its couple of hundred years late and it doesnt really matter now when finnish is exterminated in sweden . 
  wrong river . 
  so who else has no idea where your language name came from ? 
  where suomi ( what is name of country and language ) came from , we have no idea . 
  less than that and finnishis way over 95 % . 
  there is few old finnswedes who cant speak finnish and few younger who arent fluent but its dying . 
   me\u00e4nkieli i hate that , its political `` made up '' language . 
  its finnish dialect with few more swedish loan words . 
  what i ate yesterday . 
  2 cans of pea soup . 
  pot , add little water . 
  open pea soup cans and hit hole in bottom with knife . 
  blow in that hole so all soup comes out in pot . 
  warm and add little bit of mustard . 
  eat . 
  its because you made this [ youghurt ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/zdlggef4bidf8w6tmzt-hs7yvn7vauw-q4ltnbuce5q.jpg?w=768&amp;s=89f38be9e45a35c944ae0ad869b36487 ), 
  so others leave us alone , its too cold to talk or go outside . 
  only month to nightless night in where i live . 
  sunrise 3.6 . 
  1:29 and set 7.7 . 
  1:05 today is rise 3:48 and set 22:29, 
  most are `` because i just am '' members of church because of marriage/cristening/burial etc.
