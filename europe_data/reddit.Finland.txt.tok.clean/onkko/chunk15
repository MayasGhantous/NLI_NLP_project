  there is few things we can agree with with russians , sauna , beer and vodka are on top , 
  they tried to block finnish tv in estonia because of `` that kind of propaganda '' :d, 
   i grew up in a very poor post-socialist dystopia . 
  looking finnish propaganda like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lh9idb2_x8 ), 
  its like angry baltic , ready to battle !, 
  obvious kirotusvire so please ... 
  that was when i were young tho :d today i just use sauna and [ this kind of pan ] ( http://www.saunamarket.fi/cms/files/makkarapannu.jpg ) hanging over stove so sausages cook while sauna warms up/we are saunaing and we are inside like civilized people . 
  so sausages , beer , sauna , mild burns for one who is too drunk and wants to add logs , no mosquitoes [ because of repellent ] ( http://www.raid.fi/tuotteet/raid-liquid-electric-sahkoinen-hyttystorjunta/ ) ( that works ) , some vodka and card games . 
  you should know that stuff , i have seen videos of russian saunas and seems similar , 
  but do you have [ metal mass ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7ypymty8-q ) :d, 
  nooo !, 
  i dont want [ basilisks ] ( https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/5/53/basilisk_-_fbcases.png/revision/latest?cb=20161129174406 ), 
  sausage over open fire and beer . 
  find some wood and make fire . 
  find some stick and sharpen it , stick sausage in it . 
  [ cook over open fire ] ( http://www.vastavalo.net/albums/userpics/11544/normal_nuotiomakkaravaaka.jpg ) while drinking beer and talking shit . 
  add mustard and eat , burn your mouth and cool it down with more beer . 
  pass out and wake up fully eaten by mosquitoes . 
  get more beer and sausages and repeat . 
  [ and be rescued ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4htvagm.jpg ), 
  finns have [ those too ] ( http://kkmq714ij6qr9flq2ye80mt5.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/m6a0101-640x360.jpg ), 
  https://finland.fi/life-society/where-does-finnish-come-from/  how long finnish-speakers have populated finland is a question that has always interested finnish scholars . 
  nowadays it is thought that speakers of a finno-ugric language have been living in the area of present-day finland since at least 3000 bc . 
  we get that too , in army . 
  to find russians !, 
  best way to find russian is ask them to say `` hyv\u00e4 '', 
  not really , we just have endless possibilities but use only few . 
  you cant . 
  its `` the , at , from , an , etc. . . '' in one word, 
  nah , just `` thing '' + `` what '' + `` whom '' mixed in one word like finnish . 
  easy . 
   kusi palaa my pee is on fire in german that would be dickflamethrower, 
  we mostly just grunt eachother . 
  most neantherdal genes makes that . 
  yep , we have 999 cases and only use few , 
  its hard if you compare that you are english and learn german instead but if you are estonian its piece of cake . 
  and if you dont speak any indo-european language there is no real difference . 
  i know one from indonesia who lives here and after 6 months she spoke understandable `` tarzan '' finnish and now after years she speaks almost like local . 
  fun fact . 
  in here lapland i have friends who have surname berg . 
  been here atleast few generations . 
  its not really that complicated , its just a , an , at , in etc in word instead of before a word . 
  yes somewhy names of kings etc are translated . 
  for example current queen of brits is elisabet ii and her father was yrj\u00f6 vi, 
  fun fact : \u00e5 is swedish o what is exactly finnish o is but its \u00e5 because of history its part of our alphabet . 
  so for example \u00e5bo is pronounced obo . 
  i dont know if there is any difference in sweden . 
   that 's the joke ; \u00a8 ) added tears so fixed that to you . 
  it was thing in early 90s , went out of fashion soon . 
  actually it was calculated that if you buy beer instead of `` common stock '' you would be better of after `` common stock '' crashed , 
  when i moved to my current apartment in 2011 it was owned by my great aunt and was vacant long time . 
  i found one of these with `` best before '' 1.6.1993 and it had few cookies . 
  old so erosion ? 
  `` mount olympus is formed of sedimentary rock laid down 200 million years ago in a shallow sea . 
  various geological events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea . 
  around one million years ago glaciers covered olympus and created its plateaus and depressions . 
  with the temperature rise that followed , the ice melted and the streams that were created swept away large quantities of crushed rock in the lowest places , forming the alluvial fans , that spread out all over the region from the foothills of the mountain to the sea . 
  its 1080 pcs , price is same and we use euro . 
  http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/commit-sudoku `` commit sudoku '' is an expression intentionally confusing the japanese word `` seppuku '' for suicide by disembowelment with the sudoku puzzle game . 
  it is often associated with the engrish catchphrase `` shamefur dispray '' . 
  exactly !, 
  no its not and yes it is , its about russian intelligence boat sinking because of collision with sheep transferring ship . 
  is anything real ? 
  of course we know ahmed ahne, 
   have the animals crossing the street [ fucking reindeers in road ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srsizia8aza ), 
  `` the russian government began massive distribution of russian passports to the residents of abkhazia and south ossetia in 2002 without georgia 's permission ; this `` passportization '' policy laid the foundation for russia 's future claim to these territories . 
  russians regardless why they are here can be used as propaganda so less is better . 
  parts of it . 
  somalis from finland go there for holidays ... 
  eat my [ tractor eggs ] ( https://cronicasdobrasil.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/20121001-071249-am.jpg ) and [ finnish nobel winner ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/a._i._virtanen ) who created those !, 
  my only series post and it was blocked :(, 
  finns lived in finland before any of current religions existed . 
  estonia can into nordic , 
  they care only when its russians and outside russia and good for them . 
  regards finnic . 
  thank deity that we only have small amount `` russians '' e.g. 
  mostly finnic people from 1990s and rich russians who dont want to see russians around their houses :d now goverment plans to get `` buy first '' right because russians are buying `` interesting '' places . 
  whatever i think about old goverments they did something right . 
  tried irl once , it sucks . 
  westerners working there probably live gated community full of other westeners ,, 
  now that i have few beers ill answer as you are ignorant children . 
  no im not , my granma inherited few but sold those in 80s like cows and sheeps . 
  no i dont know any herder , i know few who do that as hobby or as extra income because they just have those . 
  i know few who keep them as tourist attraction . 
  its like cowboy lifestyle , hard as fuck and stereotype and no one wants to do that if they can do something else . 
  atleast old `` card stamps '' etc were sf , 
  because its map weeks , soon is x weeks and who knows what is coming next week on europe , stay tuned !, 
  maybe best crops of europe !, 
  latvia shows her potato !, 
   \u2764 ve \u2764 sf ? 
  those are in finland . 
  saw documentary about it , interesting . 
  imagine if war didnt happen . 
  so forget war . 
  it wasnt totally myth but it wasnt worth of cost tho . 
  are you a cowboy ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.sssscomic.com/comicpages/196.jpg ), 
  hey !, 
  i live there : /, 
  never seen one , i think those are used to food .
