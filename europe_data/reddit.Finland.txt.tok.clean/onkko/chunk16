  im not sure how i can read finnish constitution but seems its right in here too . 
   section 13 - freedom of assembly and freedom of association everyone has the right to arrange meetings and demonstrations without a permit , as well as the right to participate in them . 
  everyone has the freedom of association . 
  freedom of association entails the right to form an association without a permit , to be a member or not to be a member of an association and to participate in the activities of an association . 
  the freedom to form trade unions and to organise in order to look after other interests is likewise guaranteed . 
  more detailed provisions on the exercise of the freedom of assembly and the freedom of association are laid down by an act . 
   section 76 - the church act  provisions on the organisation and administration of the evangelic lutheran church are laid down in the church act . 
   the legislative procedure for enactment of the church act and the right to submit legislative proposals relating to the  church act are governed by the specific provisions in that code . 
    its semi official state church what haves rights and responsibilities like keeping population registry of members and bury even most heinous blasphemers  church books are oldest and best way to [ track your ancestry ] ( http://www.sukuhistoria.fi/sshy/kirjat/kirkonkirjat/arkisto/paikkakunnittain.htm ) . 
  there is limit of 100 years or something so they dont publish `` new '' info . 
  there is no translation of church law but [ heres finnish version . ], 
  ( http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1993/19931054 ) nicest thing in that law is about confessions , its illegal for priest to tell police or anyone and they can only hint something is going to happen but never give out identity directly or indirectly . 
  chapter 1 - fundamental provisions section 1 - the constitution finland is a sovereign republic . 
  the constitution of finland is established in this constitutional act . 
  ** the constitution shall guarantee the inviolability of human dignity and the freedom and rights of the individual and promote justice in society . 
  ** finland participates in international co-operation for the protection of peace and human rights and for the development of society . 
  finland is a member state of the european union ( 1112/2011 , entry into force 1.3.2012 ) . 
  in finland we have that also .
