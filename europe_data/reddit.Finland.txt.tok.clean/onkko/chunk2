  ... he will get good dash cam video of accident ? 
  swedes sure are if they dont live with immigrants ... 
  here is danish tv2 news https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_rvmhfshhk&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  he links to svt what isnt exactly neutral source but should be nearly factual . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/jamtland/ostersund-tant-under-earth-hour ) is same news from svt . 
  he just translated it . 
  this isnt myth . 
  no , im saying that its idiotic to blame finland that ussr didnt evacuate civilians and that germany attacked . 
  finns didnt attack leningrad or supply routes . 
  we didnt stop you to deliver food , we let route open and didnt attack . 
  look at this [ map ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/jatkosota#/media/file:finnish_advance_in_karelia_during_the_continuation_war_\\ ( finnish \\ ) . png ) do you really tell that finns should have let ussr army deep behind finnish lines ? 
  land route was cut by germans . 
  there is no problem . 
  they are seeking asylum and if they really need it they get it , just not in country of their choosing . 
  yes . 
  they didnt attack/cut on russian supply routes . 
  article 1 means whole section 1 what includes article 6 ... and article 6 is about fair trial , do they have to be in europe to get fair trial ? 
   at the very least i do n't make it a country assisting in one of the most despicable crimes ever , blockading st petersburg sentencing almost everyone to death by starvation . 
  controversy over finnish participation [ edit ] almost all historians regard the siege as a german operation and do not consider that the finns effectively participated in the siege . 
  russian historian nikolai baryshnikov argues that active finnish participation did occur , but historians have been mostly silent about it , most likely due to the friendly nature of post-war soviet -- finnish relations . 
  [ 89 ] the main issues which count in favor of the former view are : ( a ) the finns mostly stayed at the pre-winter war border at the karelian isthmus ( with small exceptions to straighten the frontline ) , despite german wishes and requests , and ( b ) they did not bombard the city from planes or with artillery and did not allow the germans to bring their own land forces to finnish lines . 
  baryshnikov explains that the finnish military in the region was strategically dependent on the germans , and lacked the required means and will to press the attack against leningrad any further . 
  what part of it ? 
  i hear `` international agreements '' buzzword too much . 
  2014 census says 1 983 french nationals and 3 736 who speak french as mother language lives in finland . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdtrib4e0k ), 
  its gone already . 
  majority of big generations have retired already . 
  seen that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eul_nnz2heu, 
  its investment not luxury . 
  it will pay itself . 
  finns also have `` selk\u00e4ranka '' what is something you need to have to stand up . 
  its also part of sisu , dont you be real in here , fuck off !, 
  jne ... we do have common language , 
  as others said about legal stuff there is also `` how your community looks at you '' problem . 
  from youth you are counting days to go `` be a man '' training and you are soldier of finland . 
  proudest moment of my life was when i stood up and pledged allegiance to finland and my parents were watching . 
  we know times when russia killed and slaved 20 % of population and times when they tried same . 
  real threat is only way to keep foreign malicious povers out . 
  and i as soldier add up . 
  nice thing about army is that everyone is in same lever and for same cause . 
  regardless of if you think finland should be far left or right you fight for right to finland say what it is . 
  and where inner willing and things come ? 
  checkmate virolaiset  sisus means also filling in finnish but sisu is own word . 
  in ussr days that was truth , doctors/teachers/whatever were selling vodka in harbours and they did good money from it . 
  warchilds . 
  disaster made by `` feel good '' swedes . 
  it was mistake and costly . 
  finland didnt want it but was forced to do it because politics . 
  i know `` swedish '' ( you know finnish presence there ? 
  even if you try to hide it with makeshift languages like me\u00e4nkieli ) people helped a lot but your goverment or royals did only after huge pressure amd did everything to stop helping . 
  only real help would have been mobilization and declaration of war . 
  you officially left us alone . 
  and that wasnt first or last time . 
  it is . 
  `` sure '', 
  you would have been west russia withouth finns . 
  to you we were and probably are expendable army and shield against russia . 
  thanks for 18 , 39 and 41-45 . 
  not to mention 1809 or others ... 
  you should look at sveaborg . 
  from desolate lands , these wolf islands have been transformed into a sveaborg ( suomenlinna ) . 
  progeny , stand here on your own foundation , and do not rely on foreign help . 
  foreign help rarely comes withouth cost if it even comes , im looking at you sweden !, 
  you are thinking ad hoc conscription armies and forget that support for conscription and fighting even outcome is unclear is high in finland ( 70 % + ) and that we constantly train troops . 
  so its lots about culture , there is no surrender in vocabulary when its about homeland . 
  regural john in finnish military is well trained and we do have special forces who are even better trained . 
  its not `` lets give a man rifle '' thing . 
  throw 50k navy seals against 250k conscripts who are defending their home and have support of 2.5 m mostly ( 80 % ) trained man and 2.5 m supporting womans . 
  gl hf its vietnam all again but with better training and weapons . 
  no you havent . 
  you linked in bullshit page . 
   the lutheran calendar of saints is a listing which specifies the primary annual festivals and events that are celebrated liturgically by some lutheran churches in the united states what that haves to do with finland ? 
  so you cant even stop child marriages and talk for us about child abuse ... 
  it is debate as long we cant just say `` dont '' . 
  so you say swedes made cities in places where was no finnish people living ? 
  they arent kept in refugee centers , they are free to roam around . 
  its just place where they can sleep . 
  also 1809 borders went on wrong river , gib back `` me\u00e4nkieli '' speakers !, 
  or forced some official name in swedish and local population had no say on that ? 
  finnish names lived tho . 
  im by birth evangelic-lutheran like most i know and i do live in finland but i havent heard about any saint . 
  of course there is lot of people who are worth to remember but nothing like catholic praising . 
  and what are those feast days you are talking about ? 
  i know only christmas and `` end of elk season '' . 
  what is abuse in turkey ? 
  sand in the crack ? 
  70s advert about it http://manki1.mbnet.fi/mainoksia/alapesu.jpg, 
  you will be naked in front of peers and thats not odd or weird but normal . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_rnfshrudu so if youre shy youre fucked . d, 
  do we have those later so written version comes before talked version ? 
  we do change words even if those come from close encounter like holotna ( \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e holodno ) and raatata ( prata ) . 
  these are local dialect stuff and not known in all finland but examples anyway . 
  that could be it and i hear it on estonian youtube stuff , my brother is married with estonian so i see more than regular finn . 
  no because we violently loan and beat shit like silent letters out of loanwords and use as we please . 
  what is that bastard y/u what i hear then ? 
  is y similar to you \u00fc ? 
  isnt it weird mutant somewhere between u and y ?
