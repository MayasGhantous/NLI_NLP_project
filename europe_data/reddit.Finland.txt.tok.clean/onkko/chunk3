   in february , the austrian parliament amended the country 's century-old `` islam law . '' the new legislation , though controversial , is a significant achievement . 
  in promoting a moderate , homegrown islam compatible with democratic values , austria has taken a positive step to combat extremism while protecting religious liberties . 
    the original islam law , passed in 1912 , sought to integrate thousands of muslims who officially came under the rule of the austro-hungarian empire following its annexation of bosnia and herzegovina in 1908 . 
  predominantly roman catholic , austria-hungary extended muslims the same rights of worship as other official religions , and granted state protection to islamic customs , doctrines and institutions . 
  but the empire 's breakup following world war i left just a few hundred muslims in austria , and the islam law became irrelevant . 
    the current landscape is vastly different . 
  a 2014 university of vienna report put the number of muslims in austria at over 550,000 , or about 7 percent of the national population as of 2012 . 
    the number of muslims first began to increase in the 1960s and 1970s , with the arrival of tens of thousands of guest workers from the balkans and turkey . 
  refugees from bosnia and kosovo followed in the 1990s ; more recently , austria absorbed thousands of asylum-seekers from syria , afghanistan and iraq . 
  there has also been natural expansion among second - and third-generation immigrants ; as of 2009 , about half of the country 's muslims were austrian nationals . 
    the reforms follow years of lobbying by muslim leaders , who argued that their people have effectively remained second-class citizens . 
  the updated law confirms islam 's official status and expands muslim rights . 
  muslims will be allowed time off from work to observe islamic holidays and be able to receive spiritual care and halal meals in hospitals , prisons and the armed forces . 
  the law also establishes a theological program for imams at the university of vienna , where instruction will reinforce european social values . 
    but other reforms , which vienna says are aimed at counteracting extremism , are contentious . 
  the updated law bans other countries from financing islamic groups , and bars foreign clerics from leadership positions in austrian mosques . 
  all imams must speak german , and muslim clergy must prove `` professional suitability , '' either by completing the university of vienna program , or demonstrating equivalent training . 
  stressing that austrian law takes precedence over shariah , it requires muslim organizations to show a `` positive attitude toward society and state , '' or risk closure . 
  ( it remains unclear exactly what constitutes a `` positive attitude , '' or how this will be monitored . ), 
    austria 's reforms set a precedent in europe , where concerns about extremism have been echoed by other governments . 
  the french prime minister , manuel valls , has voiced disapproval of a `` reflexive '' reliance on foreign funding by france 's muslim institutions . 
  sebastian kurz , austria 's integration minister , says german and swiss officials have expressed interest in similar financing controls . 
    advertisement   continue reading the main story  advertisement   continue reading the main story   austrian reactions have been mixed . 
  muslims have generally -- if grudgingly -- accepted the reforms . 
  the islamic religious community in austria , an umbrella group that helped draft the amendments , conceded that the outcome `` probably comes closest to the needs of both parties . ''   but because austria 's christian and jewish groups do not face language restrictions , and may receive foreign financing , others find these measures highly discriminatory . 
  some muslim organizations have vowed to bring complaints to austria 's constitutional court . 
  on the other end of the spectrum , the anti-immigration freedom party opposed the law , deeming it ineffective in curbing extremism . 
    some objections have merit . 
  a blanket ban on foreign financial support is a blunt instrument that risks alienating muslims by subjecting them to special rules . 
  and while many islamic institutions depend on foreign funding , not all of these donors have extremist ties . 
  but the law eschews any attempt to differentiate between foreign sources , and some moderate islamic groups are unlikely to survive . 
  even the organization for security and cooperation in europe , reviewing the proposed bill , found the ban unnecessarily broad . 
    the language requirements may not achieve much : extremism is as likely to spread in german as in any other language . 
    but these measures respond to a real concern . 
  a small yet growing number of austrian muslims is embracing radical islam ; officials say nearly 200 have left the country to join jihadist movements in the middle east . 
  with the reforms , vienna is acknowledging the current climate while striking a balance between civil liberties and national security . 
    freezing foreign revenue streams remains the best way to encourage the development of an independent austrian islam . 
  the ban is aimed especially at turkey and saudi arabia , which are vying for leadership of the sunni muslim world and whose governments have exported their competing versions of islam to austria for decades . 
  saudi arabia , which has been accused of sponsoring the spread of salafism and wahhabism -- anti-western ideologies that seek to impose shariah -- has financed the construction of mosques in austria and operated schools and cultural centers . 
  turkey 's president , recep tayyip erdogan , has urged austria 's turkish muslims to reject assimilation . 
  according to mr. kurz , at least 60 muslim clerics currently working in austria are turkish civil servants paid by ankara 's religious affairs directorate . 
    funding by saudi arabia , turkey and other foreign governments is often aimed at shoring up their broader geopolitical interests . 
  preserving this patron-client relationship will only impede the full integration of austria 's muslims . 
  the financial restrictions are necessary in order to break these ties , and will help foster greater self-determination . 
    austria 's updated islam law may be imperfect , and muslims have a right to request more nuanced legislation . 
  but to the extent that the reforms broaden the rights of austria 's muslims , and help thwart extremist foreign influence , they are essential . 
  one century ago , austria officially recognized islam . 
  today it may again be at the vanguard of muslim integration .

  http://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/arminas-15-skrev-sjalv-om-konflikten/  two versions of why  there are currently two versions of the reason for that arminas killed . 
   14-year-old father in an interview with aftonbladet claimed that her son was subjected to bullying by arminas pileckas . 
   prosecutor pernilla tallinger leading the preliminary investigation has not wanted to comment on what the 14-year-old said in interrogation . 
   - it has been a long interview with him in which he gave his views on the matter , she has previously told the evening post . 
   the other version is that arminas pileckas protected a classmate against the 14-year-old and asked him to let his classmate alone . 
  it should have triggered the altercation at the end of november . 
   several sources told the evening post that at least two witnesses heard by the police supports that version . 
   the swedish media council ( governmental body ) if swedish government dont like it then it is doing something right . 
   according to the father , the real background to the assassination at g\u00f6inge school in broby , sk\u00e5ne , is that arminas had been in a minor brawl with the syrian student in december . 
  the syrian had sexually harassed a girl and arminas came to her defense . 
   -- a week later , we went to the school for a meeting . 
  the boy swore he would take revenge on him , and that is what he did , says the father .

  however , the risk difference remained significant . 
  the difference between immigrants and natives was in part explained by the high proportion of young men and low-median income level of immigrants .
