  is that because you dont get sex ? 
  no nazis here . 
  any source for that ? 
  on goverment loans , yes . 
  but those are bigger banks etc who dont know where put money safely . 
  in my account its currently 0,01 % and because i dont have monthly/usage fees its practically 0 % but if you have monthy etc fees its de facto negative . 
  i just talk louder . 
  between finland and sweden mocking is national sport so wont happen here , 
  finnish language is not a joke but ability to speak it what is required is , , , imagine worst possible `` some country language '' and thats enough ... and i have talked with people who have citizenship and fuck that , they cant talk finnish . 
  of course i also have talked with people who dont have citizenship and i couldnt tell they were foreigners . . estonians mostly . 
  no language test ? 
  do they test if i live there ? 
  i do have swedish id number because i were there 79-82 or something near that . 
  i wont benefit to having swedish citizenship but im curious , 
  sweden , fighting on last finn . 
  its excited motormouth so normal finnish would sound different . 
  think about old times and wars , walled city protected people in and around it . 
  also taxation was easier with that way . 
  of course its useless today but you dont just demolish 1000 years of history . 
  its not about winning , its about that sweden loses :d, 
  so you are telling me that kinkku , salami , ananas , aurajuusto isnt best pizza ever :(, 
  im thinking about smoke sauna in space station and ... fuck :d, 
  thats not troops but general . 
  in finland its not about your `` gender hot '' . 
  its more like prayer and no sexual . 
  ah , just like my russian !, 
  build by native finns or immigrant finns and their offspring , 
  and that is `` even if outcome is unclear '' . 
  no , it wouldnt be even in news . 
  unchr so i dont even read . 
  make tl : dr of it . 
  thats catholophobia !, 
  or invent correct name . 
  found , dealt , ridiculed , made responsible etc instead of telling its phobia and we have to understand . 
  its not news that pedophiles go where there is lot of childrens and thats why for example finland wants clear criminal record for everyone who work with children but that cant remove all . 
  most important is that it is not hidden or understood . 
  that is what catholic church and some smaller churches did/do . 
  and that is what most of people oppose instead of understand . 
  youre ugly :(, 
  there is already comments about provoking . 
  you know that womans shouldnt walk alone or uncovered ... 
  regards `` association of muslims who fight against islamophobia '' ... 
  `` you can attack and you probably win because you are much bigger but it will cost you , cost a lot . 
  and you really cant occupy finland when people are really hostile '' finnish defence . 
  noticed that too , it is coincidence and now i feel like a stalker :d im not here everyday and you just managed to do 2 posts where i wanted and `` could be arsed '' to answer , 
  well i wouldnt call stealing womans to slavery by vikings as immigration , 
  im professional drunk , can i come ? 
  well nordics imported lot of teenage girls from uk so maybe they hear call of home soil , 
  in finland we say best seasoning to everything is hunger . 
  because 5 % rkp who is yesman to everyone who keeps it . 
  and wealthy finnoswede funds . 
  i fucking love and hate estonian language , so close but so far . 
  i feel that im having stroke when i hear or read it . 
  so because your country didnt win conscription is bad ? 
  you are from country what doesnt have any credible threat from neighbours . 
  we , however , have to maintain credible threat that if neighbour wants to come it will cost a lot . 
  i dont argue with my temperature meter . 
  -51,5 is official tho . 
  here its stay home if transportation doesnt work . 
  regards one who walked 2km to work because car didnt start and saw kids going in school while it was -55 c. 
  because finland has strong military . 
  but why they dont have arms or stomp on eastern arms . 
  looks like whiny western stuff where you dont really take a place . 
  its retarded http://satwcomic.com/coat-of-arms be gentle :(, 
  why belgium have unarmed finnish coat of arms in their benches ? 
  not exactly law but our criminal code still starts with `` we aleksander third , by the grace of god ... '' me aleksander kolmas , jumalan armosta , koko ven\u00e4j\u00e4nmaan keisari ja itsevaltias , puolanmaan zsaari , suomen suuriruhtinas , y.m. , y.m. , y.m. 
  finnish : rauha, 
  no it doesnt , it comes from germanic word for crying . 
  vaino what is finnish for persecution or old word for war is related to vojna . 
  thats because its finno-ugric while most of rest are indo-european . 
  here is nice language tree http://mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/196.jpg, 
  they look and are finnish vaino ( persecution or old word for war ), 
  i live bit north of arctic circle , http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/weather/kemij%c3%a4rvi snow depth 48 cm, 
  i heard it in army . 
  finland has `` section 10 - breach of the sanctity of religion ( 563/1998 ) a person who ( 1 ) publicly blasphemes against god or , for the purpose of offending , publicly defames or desecrates what is otherwise held to be sacred by a church or religious community , as referred to in the act on the freedom of religion ( 267/1922 ) , or ( 2 ) by making noise , acting threateningly or otherwise , disturbs worship , ecclesiastical proceedings , other similar religious proceedings or a funeral , shall be sentenced for a breach of the sanctity of religion to a fine or to imprisonment for at most six months . '', 
  and that was last used few years ago succesfully against politician who dared to defame muhammed ... 
  finnish record -51.5 from kittil\u00e4 , pokka 1999 and its about as north as that hotel . 
  1999 was `` interesting '' winter ... after week -40 to -50 isnt fun anymore . 
  my own temperature meter recorded -57 one morning . 
  its not something what removes other . 
  look around and see that crime is tied to whatever is in power . 
  `` white '' kind asks `` why you are so black '' and he answers . 
  oh well if im black im known by all oh well if im black im wanted ( waited ) by good one lord and king from land of murians one lord and king from land of murians then `` white '' tells he has anyways to kneel and so on . 
  so story about old war and probably black was middle eastern then etc. 
  think about our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh2tcv3pje0 tiernapojat . 
  that few hundred years old tradition is of course racist because we dont have black or `` middle eastern '' people to play ... fckng king of murians , king of black people who were black and now its bad to tell that he was black ... sassy black who rose against king herodes . 
  well ... fuck . 
  is that kaneli s , http://www.maku.fi/reseptit/kaneliassat looks like that but its not s no you cant offend swedes by eating 2 :d, 
  thats `` small amounts '' who look like and dont have that much different culture , assimilated . 
  while we do `` hate '' each other we are together against any foreign bully and we do have basic trust on eachother and we managed to make laws to all of us . 
  because ww2 killed 20 percent and destroyed all and then came russians telling their 5 year plans what to do ... you remember iron curtain and ussr ? 
  its not decade or two to build a country from nothing . 
  or letting estonians know how things were in finland , they really tried to stop/interfere tv and radio from finland https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/disko_ja_ydinsota advertisements like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lh9idb2_x8 were `` unreal propaganda '' , 
  http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1993/en19931380.pdf `` 5 ) ; support tolerance and ** multiculturalism ** and provide programming for minority and special groups ; '', 
  48 354 estonian citizens lived in finland in end of 2014 , 3 738 dual citizens living in finland and 46 195 spoke estonia as mother language . 
  fern only blooms in midsummer night and picking it would give magical povers, 
  https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/juhannustaika so as already said `` collect flowers and you see your future husband in sleep '' or `` you get good marriage if you roll naked in meadow in morning dew in new year '', 
  midsummer or as we call it juhannus is a big holiday . 
  basically whole country stops and everyone is in cottages or similar and bonfires everywhere . 
  lot of concerts and similar also .
