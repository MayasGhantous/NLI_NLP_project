  https://www.rt.com/news/310757-sweden-malmo-blasts-crime/ '' `` it is the thirtieth explosive attack since the new year . 
  we have a situation that is serious , '' said the malm\u00f6 police chief , stefan sint\u00e9us , about the explosion on friday , as quoted by the local.se on saturday . '', 
  finnish flag between jan-may 1918 was retarded lion  https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_lippu#/media/file:flag_of_finland_1918_ ( state ) . svg, 
  in finland [ guestion is ] ( http://www.findikaattori.fi/en/77 ) '' if finland were attacked , should finns , in your opinion , take up arms to defend themselves in all situations , even if the outcome seemed uncertain ? '', 
  that was mainly to shut up `` we have to do something '' crowd in sweden etc. 
  and current opinion is [ it was a mistake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war_children ) . 
  thats sentence what is used to learn r and s. 
  yep http://imgur.com/n4p2is8 `` money is only budjeting probem '' says student with 300ke capital income . 
  in finland actual income and final taxation is public .

  finland has candle thing and catholicism was kicked out 16th century . 
  had picture of himself holding decapitated head in his public facebook page ... so desecration of enemy combatant, 
  nah , [ hakkapeliittas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) were better , 
   hey i know that feeling . 
  when i was a kid we got artillery shells and bombs drooped on us in the yugoslav war/croatian war of independence . 
  now when we heard air sirens it was usually the `` get into basement '' siren for the young me ... like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/2wbdgufjflc?t=41 ) ? 
  usa pays lot more of healtcare than finns . 
  http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/us/fi  per capita public and private health expenditures combined in finland are $ 4,231.90 usd while the united states spends $ 8,895.10 usd, 
  it was secular because of dictator or strong leader , not because of democracy . 
  after democracy turkey went backwards and fast . 
  just like arab spring . 
  islamic theocracy . 
  like turkey ? 
  democracy doesnt mean people who think like you . 
  image 25 : is tulppaana ? 
  -- he says that he cant sleep because sun doesnt set , says old gentleman looking sad . 
  i can relate , sun doesnt set :(, 
  well viron sosialistinen neuvostotasavalta was a thing 25 years ago . 
  i were jaeger 6 years before 9/11 . 
  can i get medal or something ? 
  so firearm suicide dropped , did suicide rate drop ? 
  for example finland has high amount of guns and most probable violent way to die is by kitchen knife while drinking with friends ... you are statistically safer next to gunowners . 
  actually sun rose 4.6 and sets 7.7 so its up and staying . 
  or are you some southener !, 
  look definition of set . 
  atleast what i have seen it means `` under x degrees '' so still visible is possible . 
  source , next official sunset is next month and i want night to come back . 
  add coat of arms in war flag like in [ finnish one ] ( http://yle.fi/aihe/sites/aihe/files/migrated/oppiminen/images/20130423-1221_jpeg_img_2012.jpg ) and then its perfect . 
  [ here ] ( http://s29.postimg.org/h1utci3wn/sotalapsi1.jpg ) is picture what people think about and what is marketed versus what is reality . 
  and yes , people in that picture are unaccompanied `` children '' . 
  i remember when i saw it in news ... [ here ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22818228.ab ) is extra where you can see 2 `` children '' in sweden . 
  they have court what is not muslim and no other way gives any kind of legality . 
  so illegal pressure stays illegal . 
  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/modern-humans-more-neanderthal-than-once-thought-studies-suggest/ ** in europe , finns had the highest neanderthal dna rate with 1.2 percent . 
  ** so finnish stuff !, 
  new nokia ? 
  but to be honest i find funny and not suprise that finns are not only proud mongols but neanderthals !, 
  i understand and problematic in here is that you have had jewish similar stuff decades . 
  in finland you know that court is for you , there is no sharia court just court . 
  sure there can be underground sharia courts where you can be pressured but those dont have any legitimate so wanting to go court there is only one option and thats your safety . 
  moving here means you accept local laws and ways . 
  we arent talking about old minorities and even if we do then do we really want different laws to different people ? 
  for example thefts would stop if you make stealing legal . 
  or that there is any chance of muslims taking over any part of the uk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_trojan_horse, 
   anyone can disagree with the sharia court and just go to normal court even after the issue has been ejudicated . 
  banning it , unless you actively criminalised it ( v sketchy territory legally ) it 's probs best to leave as is and fix it within the system  others may disagree and have perfectly valid points of course `` can disagree '' is kinda bad , how many womans who are under pressure of both families can really disagree ? 
  you got it . 
  this small country with litte to boast about haves again something . 
  and i do find fun that american knows what we do :d http://pbs.twimg.com/media/cc9_y2aw4aazorr.jpg:large, 
  armenian, 
  they travel , in finland they came about 1600s when sweden decided enough is enough and allowed hanging them . 
  about 10k in finland now but they are most irritating and entitled bunch of idiots you can think about . 
  i assume most of who can are assimilated . 
  same about migrating beggers from romania , finns tried to give temp jobs and documentary by some nordic where they paid schooling for one ... school is bad and stealing is right way to go is their motto . 
  armenian genocide what happened . 
  not your highest moment . 
  everyone in finland knows youre [ hairyhand ] ( http://hikipedia.info/wiki/karvak%c3%a4si ) who makes pizza and kebab . 
  thats where name [ turkki ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkki_\\ ( vaate \\ ) ) comes , fur !, 
  arabs are ones who wear sheets . 
  offtopic but we have reality show about `` holiday directors '' and fucking turkish `` lets sell shit for finns '' speak better finnish than some foreigners who have been here decades ... that triggers me . 
  atleast in finland we are taught `` viro , liettua , latvia '' so we know what those little countries are and in what order , 
  pietari is finnic clay !, 
  you mean lots of br\u00e4nnvin before ? 
  we finnished your sill , here its silli . 
  new potatoes and pickled herrings ... cant wait .

  we talk about pohjoismaat normally . 
  used official calculator . 
  calculation of total taxes and tax-like charges for the entire year total taxes and tax-like charges for the entire year 1,64 future income 200,00 withholding also includes pension and unemployment insurance premiums amounting to 5.70 % and 1.15 % . 
  please add 6.85 percentage points to arrive at your actual withholding and to work out your actual take-home pay . 
  max 5kg/person . 
   to kill bacteria you 'll need + / -60 + degrees celsius temperatures , seems pretty hot . 
  never been in sauna what is under 70c , normally about 80c . 
  finns have figured that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzi3ayi85n8 and documentary about that place https://vimeo.com/111398583, 
  reminds me for this  https://youtu.be/kwzj8ekrawa?t=171,

  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1321/text/enr#link=2_b_1_a&amp;nearest=hb2e2c272d49e4f2491af9f3c3a1a9ace ) has something to do with it  2 . prohibition against sale or distribution of rinse-off cosmetics containing plastic microbeads  with respect to manufacturing , beginning on july 1 , 2017 , and with respect to introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce , beginning on july 1 , 2018 ;,

  your doctor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_finland  according to law approval for an abortion requires the signature of at least one physician ( and in some cases two ) , and in some cases additional permission from valvira ( the national supervisory authority for welfare and health ) . 
  edit : [ better info here ] ( http://www.infopankki.fi/en/living-in-finland/health/abortion ), 
  no idea , national bird etc and hunting prohibited . 
  with 2000 they would have better artillery than finns , 
  im sure she remembered who traveled in bus and why .
