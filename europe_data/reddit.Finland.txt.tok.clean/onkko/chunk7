  rkp is racist . 
  only thing they care is swedish language and fuck finns . 
  started really in ww2 when resettlement of finns ... no you cant settle them on swedish areas ... '' with help of sweden . 
  today they oppose any shared schools and anything what is finnish . 
  and they wont fight for swedish speaking population . 
  best example is refugees in 2ww and they couldnt settle in swedish areas . 
  so `` native language `` swedish '' '' in school was just `` meh '' ? 
  every higher had to speak swedish . 
  so you are telling what finns tell is false ? 
  they stopped when finns told its racist , not because they wanted . 
  and not racist when namesake told that finns or finnish language werent good enough to anything . 
  svenska folkpartiet ... sure they arent swedes . 
  swedes not getting service in swedish from every county employee is `` huge problem '' and meantime in majority swedish places hire swedish doctors and there is no problem that finns cant get finnish service . 
  tell me that we were equal , we still arent . 
  it tastes like disappointment and regret . 
  everything is racist . 
  that is belowed father of rkp . 
  what you would say if sdp would give stalin medallions ? 
  so you are telling me that finns could work for goverment or be in any higher position without speaking alien language ? 
  depends on definition of colony . 
  finns werent equal to swedish speaking population . 
  because its tobacco product what is addictive and it fucks your mouth and its only popular in sweden so sweden got permission to sell to swedes from eu . 
   do people actually come to estonia by boat and then take a bus to latvia ? 
  yes . 
  planned in advance . 
  or you plan in advance and buy enough alcohol and end up drinking it , shitload of it because you have to plan and buy `` enough '' ... 
  what country doesnt have problems with alcohol ? 
  so tell me about higher education and goverment jobs available withouth speaking swedish . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axel_olof_freudenthal  the swedish people 's party in finland considers freudenthal to be their spiritual father , and it issues an award named after him , the axel olof freudenthal medal . 
  many silver and bronze medals have been given to individuals since 1937 , but only one gold medal has been issued - to elisabeth rehn in 1994 . [ 1 ] . 
  however , the party has not issued the medal since 2007 due to external criticism of freudenthal 's racial views . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] to date , no freudenthal medal recipient has renounced the award . 
  not sweden but forced swedish and entitlement of swedish minority . 
  so no finnish higher education till 20th century and no way to go upwards if you dont speak swedish etc. . . `` integral '' ... 
   also , `` everyone '' knows that the cheapest vodka is just bad value in sweden . 
  if you just want to get as much alcohol for as little money possible it 's wine you 're supposed to buy . . 
  in finland we have page for that ( http://www.isokaato.com/top2.php ) 1 . 
  marabello 0.75 l , 9.48 $ 3 . 
  last passionfruit 1 l , 9.49 $ 8 . 
  last pineapple 0.75 l , 7.29 $ 11 . 
  sisuviina 0.7 l , 18.09 $ first vodka in 15th place , 
  its illegal to sell everywhere else in eu than sweden . 
  you are right . 
  finns have most of neanderthal in their genes in europe , asians have more . 
  also 7000 years ago people in spain were genetically closer to finns than current spanish . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelian_language#classification the karelian language belongs to the finnic branch of the uralic languages , and it is closely related to finnish . 
  [ 6 ] finnish and karelian have common ancestry in the proto-karelian language spoken in the coast of lake ladoga in the iron age and karelian forms a dialect continuum with the eastern dialects of finnish . 
  [ 7 ] earlier some finnish linguists classified karelian as a dialect of finnish , sometimes known in older finnish literature as raja-karjalan murteet ( ` border karelian dialects ' ) , but today karelian is seen as a distinct language . 
  besides karelian and finnish , the finnic subgroup also includes estonian and some minority languages spoken around the baltic sea .

  [ mongoloids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongoloid )  arthur de gobineau defined the extent of the mongolian race , `` by the yellow the altaic , mongol , finnish and tartar branches '' . 
  [ but we have court decision that we are white ] ( http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/09/are-finns-white )  according to the ethnologists , the finns in very remote times were of mongol origin ; but the various groupings of the human race into families is arbitrary and , as respects any particular people , is not permanent but is subject to change and modification through the influences of climate , employment , intermarriage and other causes . 
  there are indications that central and western europe was at one time overrun by the finns ; some of their stock remained , but their racial characteristics were entirely lost in their remote descendants , who now are in no danger of being classed as mongols . 
  ... .  if the finns were originally mongols , modifying influences have continued until they are now among the whitest people in europe . 
  it would , therefore , require a most exhaustive tracing of family history to determine whether any particular individual born in finland had or had not a remote mongol ancestry . 
  ...  the applicant is without doubt a white person within the true intent and meaning of such law . 
  [ from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_rights_of_indigenous_australians )  following australian federation in 1901 , however , the commonwealth franchise act 1902 restricted aboriginal voting rights in federal elections . 
  for a time aboriginal people could vote in some states and not in others , though from 1949 , aboriginal people could vote if they were or had been servicemen . 
  in 1962 , the menzies government ( 1949-1966 ) amended the commonwealth electoral act 1918 to enable all indigenous australians to enroll to vote in australian federal elections . 
  in 1965 , queensland became the last state to remove restrictions on indigenous voting in state elections . 
  by 1967 indigenous australians had equal voting rights in all states and territories . 
  ... by 1911 , the remaining australian states had legislated for women 's suffrage for state elections ... -- however , this franchise did not apply to indigenous women , who did not get the vote for federal elections until 1962 , as did all indigenous men , and in all states until 1967 --,

  ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen and vainolainen ( old finnish , one who persecutes or makes war ) in finnish . 
  you are right . 
  but honestly ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen comes from ven tribe and vaino comes from russian word vojna . 
   advising people to use certain words instead of others is n't a ban .
