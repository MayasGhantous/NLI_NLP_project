   women in military is relatively new thing in finland 1995 . 
  thats 22 years ago . 
  http://www.findikaattori.fi/en/77 ` if finland were attacked , should finns , in your opinion , take up arms to defend themselves in all situations , even if the outcome seemed uncertain . ' out of the entire population , 71 per cent say yes to the question, 
  in norway/sweden ( dont remember but probably norway ) they had to hire witch doctor to `` lift curse '' to get them to testify against so this isnt something new . 
  couldnt find news about it but it was about decade ago .

   they do n't even have access to the arctic sea ( or polar bears ) . 
  looking at you , russia took our arm but ... 
  [ in finnish study , nice adjusted craphs from page 28 ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/152441 )  adjustments for age , gender , and income decreased the immigrants ' higher risks of crime and victimization , compared to natives . 
  however , the risk difference remained significant . 
  the difference between immigrants and natives was in part explained by the high proportion of young men and low-median income level of immigrants . 
  these factors explained even less differences between the immigrant groups . 
  in the survey-based analyses , routine activities , parental control , and family socio-economics were related to immigrant youths ' higher risks of delinquency and victimization .

  [ sweden has refused to do new . 
  now you understand how i feel to listen estonian , its like i got stroke and just cant understand but everything sounds correct + words i do understand littered around but they dont always mean same thing . 
  like this [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjm3_rcv6x4 ) what is somekind of translation of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nemo7_l2h8y ), 
  what ? 
  we dont have any genders . 
  we have `` te '' what is polite way to say `` you '' but we dont have any gender based `` you '' . 
  te is old tho so not used anymore . 
  wtf is that 15 ? 
  woman and man so no difference . 
  it was made by japanese . 
  i was born in 1977 and i know myyr\u00e4 . 
  it may be that i were older but anyway . 
  never before thought it was swedish word . 
  we have lot of those . 
  what korsteeni is in swedish ? 
  i mean how its written/pronounced . 
  for example in here we have commonly understood word for `` its so cold that i freeze '' and its russian `` holotna '' ( that is how its written and sounds , i have no idea how its in russian ) . 
  `` every '' cold snap come from siberia so ... fuck you because you live in area where cold comes !, 
  in finland we say same but we use `` old/colloqual '' word for chimney ( korsteeni instead savupiippu ) . 
  [ we tried that with sweden and norway . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_finns )  the forest finns with their demanding slash-and-burn agriculture were suddenly considered an economic threat by increasing the cost of charcoal by burning off now valuable timber . 
  the burning of the forests was officially forbidden in 1647 and the finns were obliged to support the iron factories by providing charcoal at an artificially low price . 
    by the end of the 18th century , a large part of the descendants of the forest finns had become culturally assimilated into the swedish mainstream population . 
  during the previous two centuries , various laws and regulations had been passed to speed up the `` swedification '' process to the forest finns , including total banning of the use of finnish language . 
     a forest finn backpack , or kontti . 
   during the reign of christina , queen of sweden , a proclamation of 1646 called for the burning of houses of all those finns who did not want to learn swedish in the area that was later to be called sweden proper , west of the gulf of bothnia . 
  reading books written in finnish led in some cases to imprisonment still in the 18th century . 
  [ it was dallas . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/movies/12disco.html )   in the facetiously lighthearted documentary `` disco and atomic war , '' the director jaak kilmi , who grew up in tallinn in those days , recalls how the exploits of j. r. ewing and company mesmerized his city in the far north of the country , where the broadcast infiltrated the iron curtain . 
    `` dallas , '' he remembers , became a national mania as word of its forbidden charms filtered to the south , where residents out of range of finnish television relied on friends and relatives from the north to relay the latest plot twists . 
  finlands most common is ex-ussr . 
  [ these stats do .

  like if my ability to read affected to my ability to fuck !, 
  so is margaret , yrj\u00f6 , olavi haakoninpoika , haakon vi maununpoika , kaarle xvi kustaa etc. 
  every single king/queen etc.

  sure . 
  that makes you ignorant and self absorbed . 
  you understood what i said . 
  west finland  you soon see man in blue and white while finnish population votes to join in finland , 
  thats called cenocide today . 
  so how you spell it in your third language ? 
  i like this . 
  where do i sign in as elve ? 
  finland is land of finns , made by fins for fins.what you want ? 
  so they did stel everything , were natives wrong when they wanted to limit immigration . 
  i actually owned my nokia 2110 few years back , you can get slap in your face , 
  that -0.1 % is lie . 
  its much more . 
  there is no much difference from child born in finland by american parents but ... http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000002693527.html bit better than 1st generation . 
  not near to finns . 
  of course its fine , its official name ( communists wanted eesti ) . 
  been since ... iron age ? 
  sorry about your forests :( finland would probably look like that but we died because of cold . 
  well we are over those anchient stuff so just install some forests ? 
  im actual finn from your eastern border , we may have to liberate forest finns and me\u00e4nkieli ( as you call it ) speakers  so how it feels to be western finland , 
  no , its viro !, 
  embrace your anchient name !, 
  2nd generation immigrants in finland are net loss according to our calculations and statistics . 
  to move it to positive we should have majorly west european or comparable immigration . 
  vikings , before jesus .
