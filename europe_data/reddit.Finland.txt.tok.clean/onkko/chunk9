  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axel_olof_freudenthal  axel olof freudenthal ( 12 december 1836 -- 2 june 1911 ) , was a swedish-speaking finnish philologist and politician . 
  infamous for his racist beliefs , he claimed racial supremacy of swedes over finns in a way that parallels theories of aryan supremacy . 
  [ 1 ]   --  the swedish people 's party in finland considers freudenthal to be their spiritual father , and it issues an award named after him , the axel olof freudenthal medal . 
  many silver and bronze medals have been given to individuals since 1937 , but only one gold medal has been issued - to elisabeth rehn in 1994 . [ 1 ] . 
  however , the party has not issued the medal since 2007 due to external criticism of freudenthal 's racial views . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] to date , no freudenthal medal recipient has renounced the award .

   there are no lesser cultures . 
  what you think about universal declaration of human rights ? 
   `` safe country '' does not in fact provide them with humane conditions for living . 
  then we have atleast 2 billion people who can get asulym .

  she didnt fullfill all requirements . 
   saying it ( ` military time ' ) properly here is `` twenty four hundred hours '' vs simply saying `` 12pm . '', 
  in finland we would say `` puolilta\u00f6in '' or `` keskiy\u00f6ll\u00e4 ''  we also use 12h clock in spoken finnish and add `` illalla '' and `` aamulla '' if needed . 
  in official stuff we use 24h, 
  [ strait of gibraltar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strait_of_gibraltar ) ** strait ** is a naturally formed , narrow , typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water .

  some straits are not navigable , for example because they are too shallow , or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago . 
  about 4000 reindeer collisions per year so not so rare but i havent personally seen that many reindeers in road . 
  its common to see few next to road and you really need to slow down because as you see they just dont care about cars and can just casually walk under .

  -55 c was my own `` best '' and i didnt even try to start car but walked to work ( 1km ) . 
  i did start my car in -40 c and i couldnt change gear or do anything before it ran idle 30mins . 
  animals lived in same space and it was also sauna .
