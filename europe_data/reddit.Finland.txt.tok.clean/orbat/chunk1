well , except for their righteous russian minority of course, 
  i do n't think it 's good to assume some news sources do n't have bias or an agenda . 
  all of them do , it 's just that it 's either not readily apparent , * or * it 's a bias or an agenda you share . 
  that does n't mean you should n't trust * any * news source , though ; you just need [ media literacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_literacy ), 
  the guardian seems to be pretty good too , but i agree with / u/ed __ 's sentiment : try to get your news from a variety of sources . 
  * everyone * has some bias , including me , you , the rest of the folks here , rt , the guardian and so on . 
  is n't that what / u/gurkmanator was saying ? 
  no kidding . 
  we 're watching the future unfold , and i 'm not talking about just ukraine . 
  there were several live streams that i remember ( mostly from tahrir square , though ), 
  do n't forget that the arab spring was full of live streams . 
  with its famous mauser geri - kick . 
  oh come on , do you seriously think most europeans know any better ? 
  `` explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog : you understand it better but the frog dies in the process '' as the saying goes . 
  duh , right . 
  thanks . 
  any way to read that without signing in ? 
   rubber products dont have software in them i dunno . 
  i 'd be surprised if the japanese have n't managed to cram a cpu into a dildo . 
  what ? 
  to be fair , even russians joke about all russians being alcoholics . 
  so he 's lashing out at them ? 
  that 's a bit far-fetched , do n't you think ? 
  if he destroys his credibility he 's as good as done ; nobody would want to grant him asylum . 
  me happy as well !, 
  you do realize homosexuality has nothing to do with pedophilia ? 
  still not funny . 
  oh , right , that thing . 
  we just got really drunk and woke up to a m/91 in our hands and a bunch of dead germans in lapland . 
  eh , every country has its stereotypes . 
  i try to think of people as individuals , no matter what country they 're from . 
   i studied a semester in london , but for the life of me , i do n't recall ever hearing banana . 
  how is it pronounced differently then over here ? 
  [ it 's not even that big of a difference ] ( http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/banana ) . 
  it just sounded really jarring since i had this west coast-y accent but managed to pronounce `` banana '' like a brit . 
   how did you end up studying in sc of all places ? 
  beats the hell out of me . 
  this was back in high school so we really did n't have all that much choice about * where * we 'd be sent ( well , except for the country of course . ), 
  it was actually pretty interesting since i 'd never been to the south despite having spent some time in the states before . 
  that reminds me of a mildly amusing thing that happened to me when i was in south carolina as an exchange student way back when . 
  i spoke with a more or less american accent ( well , an approximation of one anyhow ) , but there was one word that i insisted on pronouncing the british way : banana . 
  hilarity usually ensued , especially since by the end of the year i really did sound american ( people thought i was from california . ), 
  just stay out of lapland this time , okay ? 
  i know we let you guys use it and all since we were friends back then , but it was really not cool at all that you burned it down when you left . 
  but it 's still not antisemitism . 
  it 's just plain ` ol racism . 
  how does hating the roma have anything to do with antisemitism ? 
  holy crap . 
  so it is . 
  ah , true . 
  how about * actor * and * actress * ? 
  it is : according to the new oxford american dictionary , `` the spellings blonde and blond correspond to the feminine and masculine forms in french . 
  although the distinction is often retained in britain , american usage since the 1970s has generally preferred the gender-neutral blond . '', 
  does n't mean it 's not french : according to the new oxford american dictionary , `` the spellings blonde and blond correspond to the feminine and masculine forms in french . 
  although the distinction is often retained in britain , american usage since the 1970s has generally preferred the gender-neutral blond '', 
  because not having potato , grandfather is die of starve . 
  for him , suffering is over . 
  what he 's saying is that they ca n't even * get * jobs . 
  there not that many jobs someone with practically no knowledge of either english or swedish and no job experience can get . 
  i replied in a hurry . 
  you 're right . 
  that graph shows the * country of origin * of non-nationals if the country is a member of eu-27 , * i.e. 
  * it 's not a graph of emigration rates , it 's immigration rates from eu-27 countries . 
  how very brave . 
  that was legitimately hilarious . 
  do n't worry , our mps will probably just vote `` no '' because they 're afraid of pissing off the christian democrats . 
   the trustworthy russians you do realize chernobyl 's in ukraine ? 
   there may be more in finland not likely . 
  we 're corrupt in different ways , is all . 
  logic ? 
  nobody 's * forcing * you to masturbate to those pics . 
  i hope . 
  do you actually * know * what 's going on in syria ? 
  you 're not making any sense . 
  saying that `` radical feminists '' would oppose these `` because they 're radical '' is * not * an explanation , or any sort of argument . 
  it 's like me saying `` well / u/kierewietpiet would oppose rape emergency rooms for men because he 's / u/kierewietpiet '' and claiming that 's an explanation because it 's a `` definitions thing . '', 
  i 'd like to point out that `` cultural marxism '' is a [ conspiracy theory ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/cultural_marxism ), 
  food markets are by no means free : everyone subsidizes food production ( suomeksi siis [ maataloustuet ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/maataloustuki ) , also known as [ agricultural subsidy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agricultural_subsidy ), 
   whoosh well , * one * of you got whooshed, 
  you 're still talking about a war that 's 70 years past, 
   i wonder if they are payed to do this i do hope so . 
  having to wade through the kind of shit that sub 's liable to attract should warrant hazard pay, 
  mixed reptilian/human ? 
  is joke, 
  whoops , right you are, 
  found the portuguese, 
  how is this current one an * objectively * good example ? 
  `` auta , minua pelottaa '' would sound a bit more natural,

  do n't be silly, 
   in a representative democracy , the referendum is the tool of choice for populists to pervert the course of democracy . 
  you said it , and that 's exactly what i meant . 
  even in a representative democracy , some asshat is going to come along and give people exactly what they want , after which it 's all a race to the botton . 
  someone like trump is extremely `` effective '' because people are sick of the status quo and they feel disenfranchised ; when someone comes along and tells them they 're right and that they 're somehow better than others , people chuck all rational thought out the window . 
  yeah , it 's not like this is something new . 
  i 'm honestly starting to doubt whether average person is actually even * capable * of participating in a democracy . 
  getting people to do absolutely ridiculous shit ( usually massacring some group x because fuck them ) by pandering to their base emotions is way too easy , and it 's happened everywhere for pretty much all of recorded history . 
  validate someone , tell them they are somehow better than the others \u2122 , tell them someone is doing them an injustice but you 're here to correct it .
