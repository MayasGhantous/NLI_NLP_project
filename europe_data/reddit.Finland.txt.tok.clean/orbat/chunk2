  make them ignore the complexities of things ( which they deep down are n't even necessarily able to understand ) by reducing everything to a convenient sound bite . 
  `` government bad '' or `` government good . '', 
  `` foreigners bad '' or `` foreigners good . '', 
  oh yeah , of course you need knowledge to make informed choices . 
  my point was that people get shit information from dubious sources ( daily mail , sun , whatever ) and they never even think to question the source . 
  i mean , i 'm no expert when it comes to the eu * or * particularly smart , but i 've refused to vote on eu things without at least getting some sort of marginal notion of what the hell it 's about . 
  so much of the brexit campaign orbited around absolutely ridiculous lies , but nobody cared because they were being pandered to . 
  people felt validated because somebody was finally listening to them ; then they got spoon-fed lies that they absolutely ate up because they were told they were * right * . 
  that their opinion mattered , and here 's what that opinion should be . 
   you ca n't reasonably expect the whole society to acquire expert-level knowledge in all policy areas that 's a strawman argument . 
  i 'm not saying everyone has to be an expert , but that i 'd expect at least * basic * media literacy and search skills . 
  those two skills would have been pretty much all you needed to see that many the claims from the brexit side were complete horse shit . 
  the problem is not people having incomplete information ( because we all have that ) , but that a lot of people assume their incomplete information is total and valid , and that it 's the * experts * who do n't know shit . 
  `` people have had enought of experts '' as some politician said . 
  the brexit campaign was politicians manipulating the hoi polloi by playing on their exasperation with the status quo . 
  unfortunately the average person is too fucking stupid to tell when they 're being lied to, 
  that 's your contribution to this ? 
  `` lmao '' ? 
  obviously enough people find art valuable enough that the prices for _ good _ art can be high , then ? 
  what i 'm taking objection to here is the idea that art is somehow unreasonably expensive . 
  _ good _ art is expensive because it 's in demand . 
  there 's nothing unreasonable about it . 
  just because a photograph is quick to take does n't mean taking good photos does n't require skill . 
  let me rephrase this : what _ should _ , in your view , determine the price of photos ? 
  just the material cost ? 
  does the `` artistic '' quality of the photo matter at all ? 
  what defines the * reasonable * price of art ? 
  i mean , should they be charging for just the materials ? 
  or should different sort of art valued differently ? 
  who defines the values ? 
  artwork is still the product of skilled labor , even though it may in this case be `` just '' photographs ; they 're still _ good _ photos . 
  why are people always so horrified when they look at the prices of art ? 
   are the french keeping their promises of equality and fraternity ? 
  are the europeans doing the same ? 
  we probably are n't . 
  even in countries where there is seemingly little racism , people with `` foreign sounding '' names tend to get ignored when applying for jobs etc. 
  that was n't my point . 
  my point was that there is plenty of blame on both sides , some of it on `` european '' people , and some of it on the migrants . 
  i think the problem is that , deep down , a lot of people tend to be assholes , and that 's pretty much regardless of place of origin . 
  i 'm starting to believe the best solution really is to close the borders : too many people are too backwards to accept any sort of `` foreign elements '' , and too many of the incoming people are too backwards to accept local cultural values . 
   if you 're going to tell me that cops in `` civilized countries '' opt to shoot people in the legs like super 1337 tv show cops instead of being responsible enough to use non-lethal means to subdue perps they want alive . 
  obviously , the officer that fired felt that the life of the perp was secondary , and the terrorist is very fortunate to be alive , and is n't alive by design . 
  i said no such thing . 
  what i was saying is that the mentality that the police * have * to kill a person when they shoot at them is , in a word , crazy . 
  * you * were the one saying , and i quote , `` shooting someone in the leg is retarded , and that 's why a bunch of people got stabbed '', 
  you keep repeating that mantra , but you 're consistently missing the point everybody is trying to make here : even though firearms should only be used as a last resort , i.e. 
  when you * may * have to kill the person , there 's no need to * always * kill them . 
  gunshot wounds can be deadly no matter where you aim , but it 's perfectly possible to shoot someone without an unduly high chance of killing them . 
  wait , you 're saying they got stabbed * because * the police do n't immediately shoot to kill in civilized countries ? 
  or a good indicator that you have no idea what you 're talking about , and that it might actually be a valid area of study ? 
  do n't bother . 
  `` never argue with stupid people , they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience . '', 
  is not invasion , is liberation from fascists !, 
  how are bullshit lists fun , exactly ? 
  do n't forget aardappel , ground apple , i.e. 
  potato, 
   apple used to be the word for all `` good fruit '' how did i never realize that ? 
  huh , til . 
  get out of here with your logic and level-headed talk when there 's pitchforks to be sharpened, 
  and pretty much nobody outside the nordics actually argues about this, 
  and that ai n't no joke either ( unless you 're from an area without a sizable roma population . ), 
  hell , they stole a helsinki childrens ' hospital 's copper hand rails a few years back, 
  could also be a diversion for all we know, 
  it 's almost like the local edgy stemlords do n't understand social sciences at all / s, 
  marx wrote about a variety of subjects , and many of his theories are around today in some form or another . 
  just because you 've been told marx is the root of all evil does n't mean his theories are n't `` respected . '', 
  i think they 've just misunderstood what [ indo-european languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-european_languages ) are . 
  [ \u00d0is peidz ] ( http://www.elementalenglish.com/th-consonant-sound-english-pronunciation-lesson/ ) mait bi jusful . 
  nju inglish or\u03b8ografi ? 
  i agree with this . 
  i do n't see how needlessly antagonizing the `` other side '' will help . 
  if you believe your belief system is better , express it rationally instead of with a petulant stunt, 
  poland ? 
  so you 'd be ok with e.g. 
  cats growing boobs , then ? 
  west russia, 
  goddamn militant buddhists, 
  could be . 
  hard to say now that they chickened out, 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's the difference between e.g. 
  `` you 're a thief , therefore your argument is invalid '' and `` you 're a thief '', 
  that was n't an ad hominem , that was just an insult, 
  would you be ok with a countable number of cpus ? 
  populism is nothing new . 
  the ancient greek were bemoaning the idiocy of the masses and how they vote for the [ demagogues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demagogue?wprov=sfla1 ), 
  but i 'm reckful !, 
  well , when you consider that 50 % of the population has a lower than average iq , it should n't be all * that * surprising that referendums can end in clusterfucks . 
  you ca n't expect even intelligent people to fully understand the economy , the eu , national legislation etc. 
  and before anyone tells me i do n't know how averages work , iqs are normally distributed by design , with 100 being the average and the median . 
  well , to be fair , nationalistic parties * and * their supporters often really are racists . 
  not that i 'm a proponent of totally open borders either , mind you, 
   as much actual influence over uk policy as the teletubbies . 
  well , brexit was pretty far out there in la-la land, 
  oh yeah , right . 
  did n't make the connection , somehow, 
  what happened earlier this week ? 
  i 'm nowhere near a communist ; the problem is that despite going through my comment history while scrabbling to come up with a clever retort , you have absolutely no idea what the word `` communist '' even means in the first place . 
  you 're just parroting what marginally smarter people have managed to get you to believe . 
  now 's your time to go `` no , ur the parrot !! '',
