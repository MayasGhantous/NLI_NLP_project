the idea is that people are n't necessarily happier , despite their improved prosperity . 
  spiritual values like happiness and love are a big selling point for western churches ; it 's an emotion that a lot of people share , that the world is too much about money and work and too little about caring the ones close to you . 
  if the churches abandon the unscientific and anti-lgbt values , they could be taken more seriously in this regard . 
  nordic countries do n't have that separation , no . 
  well except for norway now , it seems . 
  the only thing left of the church-state bond is a special right to levy taxes from the members of the church ( churches in finland , we also have the same status for the eastern orthodoxy ) . 
  plus the lutheran churches here have been fairly progressive compared to other countries , the most conservative branches split off into smaller sects about 100 years ago . 
  finland is n't a monarchy so that is not the reason here at least . 
  i think the separation just has n't seen a big political movement behind it yet , as the bond is pretty inconsequential . 
  severing it would mostly be a symbolic move , though it would make the churches ' finances tougher to manage ( people would be more likely to leave the membership if they got a separate membership fee , instead of an additional 0.5 % tax ), 
  they do n't have to , they are a private organization that has no role in the legal arrangement . 
  they just perform a ceremony for those who want it . 
  you do n't get to decide who is a christian and who is n't . 
  this is n't the only subject of schism between the different nominations . 
  i would n't call le pen a far rightist , to be honest . 
  it 's better to use the political compass for this - you have the social authoritarian-libertarian axis and the economic left-right axis . 
  on that compass , le pen - far-auth centre fillon - auth right macron - moderate-lib centre m\u00e9lenchon - moderate-lib far-left hamon - lib left for comparison : thatcher - auth right hitler - extreme-auth centre-right stalin - extreme-auth extreme-left bernie - lib left hillary - moderate centre-right trump - far-auth far-right, 
  well the biggest french parties ( ps and republicans ) started doing primaries as well , so now there 's 3 rounds to determine it . 
  the issue with the primaries , though , is that only ideological diehards vote there and you get more and more extremist candidates . 
  tea party and so on . 
  / r/hamon ftfy, 
  i think bernie is more to the left than europeans give him credit for . 
  for example , his single payer plan was beyond any existing european system ( for example it fully covered dental care ) , completely free state universities are n't that common in europe , and no european country has fully legalized marijuana yet . 
  i do n't think any european country has made progressive leaps like that so quickly , maybe spain directly after franco but i 'm not familiar with how that went . 
  hollande is a political corpse , but that has very little to do with the eu . 
  it 's that he promised a more humane leftist government , but delivered a thatcher-lite labour reform , a long state of emergency , crackdowns on roma and immigrants , more mass surveillance , more than a few steps towards a police state , and backtracked on all of the stuff that made him president . 
  plus that he could n't resist merkel on austerity as he promised . 
  that looked weak as well as completely betrayed his progressive base . 
  all of his accomplishments in social policies and environment were overshadowed by the massive failure elsewhere . 
  she was at her peak 2 or 3 years ago . 
  25 % would n't even be their best result , they got 30 % in the last euro parliament election . 
  plus , it 's only 5-10 percent higher than what jean-marie had 15 years ago . 
  she 's been in politics all of her life . 
  she 's not some newcomer with a huge momentum , she 's actually been stalling around this level of support for many years . 
  the voter base ( people from impoverished former industrial towns ) is getting more solid but it 's not expanding . 
  her strategy thus far has been about making the party platform more politically correct , in a way that would make the swing voters consider voting for her . 
  she 's currently drenched in a fraud scandal , and her party is neck deep in debt from reckless spending for previous campaigns . 
  so she needs all that to fade out , a sponsor that does n't go under like the russian bank , no room for new scandals whatsoever , and whoever the opponent is , they need to fuck up * royally . 
  most importantly he gets to appoint the pm with the consent of the national assembly - this means that if the na has a president party majority , the president can negotiate about the legislation and the rest of the cabinet with the pm . 
  he also gets to disband the cabinet , which is a power that other european presidents almost never use . 
  if not , the president is not that much more than the foreign political rubber stamps / figureheads from other european countries . 
  i 've heard the french system called `` semi-presidential '' sometimes . 
  finland used to have a similar system , but towards the end of the cold war our president was stripped from a lot of that power . 
  a serious answer : they have a further privatized system than uk or other nordic countries since about 2005 . 
  the quality of care has remained good since then , but the prices have risen from around eu avg to 30 % higher than avg . 
  the system is by no means threatened by this , regardless . 
  it was implemented too soon . 
  now though , it 's too late to go back - the individual currencies would be thoroughly fucked as investors and banks are too used to euro 's stability and lack of devaluation upon every crisis . 
  investors * hate * the possibility of losing 10 or 20 percent of their gains overnight , which was the norm before euro/ecu for all currencies except for the likes of usd , dm , and gbp . 
  you still have the option of internal devaluation , but countries do n't want to use it for optical reasons . 
  the everyday consumers can see the effect much more plainly than with a conventional devaluation ( even if there 's relatively little functional difference ) - any politician to do it would not get re-elected . 
  like mike pence , the first american governor to put gay couples in jail for even requesting a marriage license . 
  approval ratings also work differently in today 's us because the political environment is extremely polarized . 
  in more relaxed and moderate countries like finland you often see 70-90 percent ratings , even some former us presidents like reagan and clinton were almost up there . 
  nowadays a potus could shit gold and he would still be absolutely hated by the opposite party . 
  trump is just even more polarizing . 
  or if a big portion of socialist supporters vote macron strategically . 
  i do n't know how much that happens in france though ... 
  i would be fine with fillion if he was a politician and not an actor best known for the main role in * firefly * . 
  ( the actual name is francois fillon ), 
  in finland our hspa and hspa + ( 3g , i 've heard that american operators sometimes falsely advertize either as 4g ) connections tend to be so densely distributed and reliable that i do n't usually notice much of a difference when getting lte ( `` proper 4g '' ) :p i think the day-and night difference that people see outside of finland might be because of sparse towers ( 4g remains fast farther away from the towers than 3g ) , or because the 3g connection was n't up to the standards , or because the high speed cables to the towers were shit and got upgraded when the 4g came in . 
  ** finland - the finns ** this will probably stand out a bit , since they are already represented in the government and influence the politics quite a bit . 
  ( the government has 3 parties that each received between 17-23 percent of the vote - the centre party , national coalition party , and the finns . ), 
  also worth noting is that their poll numbers have taken a huge dip since they got in the government , from around 18-19 percent to around 8-10 percent . 
  i 'd divide the party roughly into 3 wings . 
  the `` mainstream '' wing competes for blue collar/union workers with the social democrats , and for rural votes with the centre party . 
  they are economically centre-left , and emphasize family and religious values . 
  timo soini , the figurehead of the party , is around here . 
  the `` newcomer '' wing competes for older anti-establishment voters , and is less organized and more conservative . 
  representatives like teuvo hakkarainen have seen a lot of scandals for either racist-sounding statements or drunken stupors . 
  a smaller `` alt-right '' wing competes for angry young men with a similar but less extreme ncp fringe . 
  unlike the rest of the party , this wing is economically on the right , and best known for the blogger and parliament representative jussi halla-aho . 
  ** economics : ** the party stands on the moderate left , and in this government they have been the least enthusiastic about pm sipil\u00e4 's additional budget cuts . 
  however , since the additional cuts are mainly targeted at universities , students , and government workers , who are unlikely to support the finns anyway , they are tolerable from their perspective . 
  * personal opinion : as a university student , i got the short end of the stick here , which i 'm pretty angry about . 
  on the other hand , i recognize that they are more or less the only brake on sipil\u00e4 's budget cut machine , and without them there would have been even more cuts . 
  * ** foreign politics : ** unlike most european nationalist parties , but like poland 's pis , the finns is skeptical of russia and has declined all aid that russians have offered them . 
  this is simply because being wary of russia is ingrained in finnish nationalism . 
  they are also skeptical of international co-operation , and vote against all foreign aid packages . 
  * opinion : i 'm glad that they are n't russian puppets like fn or ukip or jobbik , but not too happy about the anti-internationalism . 
  * ** social policy : ** they are very much a conservative party . 
  they vocally opposed gay marriage ( still oppose , but silently ever since it got a clear majority support ) , initially on a christian platform and later on a `` kids need a mom and a dad '' platform . 
  the same goes for culture - they oppose funding contemporary art in general , and think that it has no meaning . 
  * opinion : i enjoy a lot of contemporary art and can find meaning in it , but it would be elitist to pour millions of euros of taxes on art that only a small portion of people can appreciate , rather than something that the masses like . 
  i appreciate them for standing by the common man here . 
  * ** environment : ** by far , the least environmentally concerned party in finland . 
  they support draining our swamps ( literally ) and using the peat as an energy source . 
  they support building new coal plants . 
  they are skeptical of climate change . 
  they managed to freeze all public funding for wind power by presenting rumors of exploding chickens ( or something like that ) to the government , and now the pm is `` waiting for research to confirm the safety of wind turbines '' . 
  * opinion : incredibly retarded on all fronts here . 
  i 'm ashamed that there are such short-sighted people in high government positions in my country . 
  i mean , trump has already backpedaled from many of his big slogans : `` lock her up '' ai n't happening , because if hillary goes to jail over mismanaging emails , god knows what awaits trump after the committees are no longer packed by spineless republican yes men . 
  `` drain the swamp '' hardly either . 
  thus far , he has only appointed either b-list establishment conservatives and industry cronies , and his treasurer is literally a goldman sachs * and * george soros guy . 
  but he * will * build the wall . 
  sure , it is a waste of money , and ineffective since the vast majority of illegals crosses the border legally and then just overstays their visa . 
  but materially it 's still possible . 
  35 billion bucks over a few years is n't a huge deal for a country of that size . 
  he * needs * to keep the one big promise that he ca n't slither or explain away .
