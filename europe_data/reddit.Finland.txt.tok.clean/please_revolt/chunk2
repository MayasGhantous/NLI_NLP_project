  grammar and the tones are far more difficult to learn than the writing system . 
   yeah and i never said anyone should change in the modern world . 
  then why argue ? 
   i wish you luck in your revolution against the numeral system . 
  i 'm sorry , what do you mean ? 
  look , there are 33 letters , there is absolutely no way it increases the cost of learning . 
  they take literally two days to learn with just basic practices few for few hours do n't you think it 'd be extremely expensive to transition to the new alphabet ? 
  all text , literature and signs will need to be redone and a whole lot more . 
  and that 's not even mentioning the fact that changing the script forces the natives who speak it ( and learners ) to relearn it , and reading for them will be slower for years if not decades due to the new script as they 're not used to reading said langauge with the script . 
  only exception would be serbian , but that 's only because they somehow use both simultaneously and equally fluently . 
  changing scripts made sense in early 20th century turkey for two reasons : arabic script that has no vowels did n't work that well with a vowel-intensive language like turkish , and secondly , turks were very illiterate . 
  neither apply for russian . 
  pretty much every russian is literate today and the script works with the language perfectly , i mean it was created with slavic languages in mind specifically for god 's sake . 
  changing a script makes zero sense in any modern established written language . 
  that includes arabic , russian , chinese , korean and everything else that westerners somehow struggle with due to the alphabet . 
  i wonder if you have ever even tried learning one ? 
  i learnt the russian alphabet in an hour . 
  greek took that long too . 
  i really do n't understand how you are able to learn the meanings of thousands of words but learning thirty fucking three symbols is somehow impossible and makes the language much harder than it actually is . 
  but how ? 
  the language will still need to be learnt . 
  what benefit is there to latinization if you still keep the language ? 
  what 's the benefit of latinization at this point ? 
  but why ? 
  can you explain ? 
  i do n't get it, 
  why not ? 
  they 're attacking an ideology and an institution , not the ones who believe in it, 
  there 's a huge difference between saying `` islam is cancer '' and `` muslims are cancer '' the first one is acceptable and the second is n't, 
  that might very well have been its original purpose but it sure as hell fits every definition of the word `` religion '', 
   ** 1 corinthians 10:26 **   for the earth [ is ] the lord 's , and the fulness thereof . 
    ** psalm 115:16 **   the heaven , [ even ] the heavens , [ are ] the lord 's : but the earth hath he given to the children of men . 
  who owns the earth ? 
  `` we already have socialism in the us !, 
  did n't you know that socialism is when the government does stuff and capitalism is when the people do stuff ? '', 
  jesus was a jew who did n't want to start a church separate from judaism , you know, 
  yeah , a very decent person who just opposes other religions and homosexuality usually that kind of people are n't decent, 
  you have no idea what either of those mean , do you ? 
  me : `` i think that the state and capitalists have way too much power which they abuse and society would be better off without them '' them : `` fucking fascist , do n't you know that it 's unconstitutional ??? '', 
  pretty much none, 
   if you are a homeless person in norway, 
  have n't seem a single fascist who is n't also a nationalist, 
  do n't forget istanbul , northern caucasus , kosovo and kazan region . 
  a religion originating in asia is a requirement for europeanness ? 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  ukraine is a relatively recent term , back during the kievan rus all east slavs were just russians and during the lithuanian and russian empire they were known as ruthenians and later little russians . 
  the word ukraine started to be used only in the 18th century ( and even then it was n't the only word to describe the region ) . 
  the word itself is old east slavic for `` borderland '', 
  i do n't think prolonging a war on any soil benefits anyone, 
  same applied for the karelo-finnish ssr, 
  a reasonable agreement would be to give those occupied regions back to ukraine on a condition that they get high degree of autonomy or a federal status ( or hell , for all of russian speaking ukraine if the locals want so ) but just handing them over to an imperialist invader does n't really set a good precedent , does it ? 
  good luck with that, 
  a war is already going on , you know, 
  well if they start fighting together , they 'll be gone pretty quick . 
  i guess that 's a good thing ? 
  malorossija was historically a province of the russian empire in northern part of today 's ukraine , including kiev . 
  i 'd say yes . 
  well it 's good for you to speak as an austrian ... 
  i propose prague because it 's geographically near the very center of europe, 
  that was after the coup and all other shit that went down . 
  earlier that year , just after the baltics left , 70 % voted for remaining https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_referendum,_1991, 
  yeah but my point is that apart from the baltics , the fprmer ussr states would be better off without the collapse, 
  what ? 
  i 'm arguing about the post baltic independence ussr , which majority of populace left supported not dissolving . 
  that state would 've ended far better than what russia and former ussr states are currently if it was n't for the stalinist coup attempt and later american intervention to get yeltsin in power . 
  well it 's a whole book of course it 's a long read . 
  you ca n't summarise all anarchist philosophy in a few sentences ... you really should read it regardless . 
  currently it sort of ( as in a variation , but still libertarian socialism ) exists in rojava , northern syria ( the kurd area ) and well working communes have worked in the past like ukraine 's free territory and revolutionary catalonia , whose economies worked very well and only collapsed because of leninist traitors invading militarily . 
  yeah , there 's literally nothing else that works , like all the other systems that came before it ? 
  but on a more serious note , what do you do when we automate every job ? 
  how do you expect capitalism to survive ? 
  there 's no feasible method for a fully automated society to work within a capitalist framwork . 
  there are many functioning alternatives that would work better , even before we fully automate everything . 
  if you really believe there 's no possible alternative and it 's impossible to find one , you just have n't even tried to look . 
  here 's just one example of a good and working system that 's in every way better than the current one : http://thebreadbook.org/conquestofbread.html, 
  just because you ca n't stop it from happening all by yourself does n't mean you ca n't oppose something . 
  i hate our government but because i 'm not able to overthrow all of them myself , i should not oppose the ruling parties ? 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
  the thing with breathing is that we 've always breathed and will always need to , meanwhile the economic system is in no way necessary for human survival and indeed we survived for two hundred thousand years without this system -- there 's no proof that the current system that has existed for little over two hundred years will be the best and last one we 'll ever achieve . 
  in the contrary , there 's a lot of proof that it is n't and that it wo n't last for much longer . 
  how is opposing it not a choice ? 
  it was better for the baltics and the eastern bloc but not for the rest . 
  the authoritarianism and ruling class control of the economy never went away , only thing that disappeared was the welfare state . 
  i love how corsica is represented, 
  no , it 's actually far simpler than it looks . 
  it 's not `` remember each line in each character individually '' , the characters have a lot in common . 
  that `` symbol system '' is far easier than it looks, 
  no , the problem was catherine of aragon, 
  i still refuse to believe that game exists, 
  you mean it saves 40 % of food when people are born , right ? 
  yeah because that totally makes it better, 
  they should n't, 
  why in the flying fuck does the uk have even a right to claim an island in the middle of fucking nowhere on the other side of the world ? 
  thanks for your imput , / u/trolls _ brigade, 
  yeah and when they decide to become authoritarian you 'll love it when only they have guns, 
  eu wants to ban aks and ars completely but were unable to so they settled with banning over 10 round mags, 
  unfortunately they 're hardly leftists and more just social democrats :(, 
  if you 'd read marx , you 'd know that being pro-gun is pretty much a requirement to be a communist, 
  he was a mentally ill person . 
  in czechia he would n't have gotten a legal gun in the first place,
