wiktionary says it 's an archaic word for ` feather ' and ` quill ' ( and `` kyni\u00e4 '' still means ` to pluck a bird ' ) . 
  now that 's just silly , 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it comes from finnish : [ rako ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rako ) + [ usko ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/usko ) = slit faith . 
  oxy as in [ oxycontin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxycodone ) ? 
  do n't do drugs , kids . 
  actually , yle offers both the original narration and a finnish voiceover for many nature documentaries . 
  which is a difficult choice , since they 're usually both pretty good . 
  here are some statistics to prove / u/toreon 's point : food and non-alcoholic beverages cost 87 % of the eu average in estonia and 119 % in finland . 
  but it 's still a separate city/municipality in the administrative sense . 
  not that there are many city-like areas in espoo ... 
  well , haavisto was an eu peace negotiator in sudan and a researcher for the finnish institute for foreign affairs , specializing in russia and `` new security threats '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure he would 've managed a chat with putin . 
  ( on the other hand , niinist\u00f6 survived a tsunami , which is almost as dangerous as putin . ), 
  as long as helsinki 's new [ transtech artic ] ( http://www.hel.fi/hel2/hkl/uusi_raitiovaunu/en/ ) is included . 
  ( though since a few of them are already in use , i do n't see why it would n't be . ), 
  thanks to your extensive lobbying , we now have links to all the language variants of our immediate neighbors i could find ( including / r/ruotsi !, 
   / r/suomi no doubt named it / r/ruotsi because the sub is in finnish . 
  but / r/suomi has links to / r/denmark and / r/norway in english , not '' / r/tanska '' and '' / r/norja '' . 
  i know for a fact that '' / r/ruotsi '' was a direct response to the weird link that / r/sweden has . 
  ( i do n't have a problem with any of this . 
  it 's just hilariously complicated . ), 
  the sweden/finland linking situation is actually pretty weird . 
  / r/sweden has a link that says `` finland '' but links to / r/suomi . 
  ( i * think * it used to say '' / r/finland '' and link to / r/suomi . ), 
  in response to this , the / r/suomi mods added a link that says '' / r/ruotsi '' but links to / r/sweden . 
  should i add a '' / r/sweden '' link that links to / r/norway and vice versa ? 
   do you want to be a hipster subreddit ? 
  [ / r/finland mod team group photo ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wpyn6owpmbm/txxobobaeci/aaaaaaaaat4/slhpnsd5ejy/s1600/a-hipsters-suck-14.jpg ), 
  i 'm a mod but do n't really see the point of linking to our `` neighbor '' subreddits . 
  we already have links to / r/nordiccountries and / r/europe , since those subreddits are about both finland and its neighbors . 
  if you have any good arguments for adding the links , i might well change my mind . 
  you only need contact between speakers for loaning words . 
  it does n't matter that the languages are n't related to each other . 
  we also borrowed [ a god ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perkele ) from you . 
  yes , it 's an [ s ] . 
  click on the speaker icon to have google translate read it out for you : https://translate.google.com/#fi/en/suomi, 
  fun fact : it 's probably related to the finnish name for finland , * suomi * .

   interesting that nobody in this thread mentions very high taxes umm , the first post in this comment thread talked extensively about taxes . 
   high alcohol taxes  vat ( sales tax of 22-24 % )  car taxes are high, 
   when it was created in the 90-s in 1958 . 
  here 's a nice poster `` celebrating '' the 55th anniversary of the temporary car tax last year : http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/562330_10151518047496168_1899581974_n.jpg, 
  did you read [ this page ] ( http://vaalit.fi/fi/index/aanestajalle/aanestaminenvaalipaivana/nainaanestatvaalipaivana.html ) ? 
  ca n't get much clearer than that . 
  they also specifically mention that you can contact the * maistraatti * if you have n't received your voting info card and you want one . 
  anyway , umm , better luck next time ? 
   finland has a highly trustworthy online-identification verification system using banking codes , and it is quite wonderful . 
  many finns trust the system to do their banking , shopping , taxes , etc. 
  why could n't we also vote like this ? 
  if i remember correctly , estonia has implemented it !, 
  online voting ( or any electronic voting in general ) is an inherently broken concept on a theoretical level ( it can be done , but it just ca n't be as trustworthy as a paper-based election system ) , and there are also implementation problems in the estonian online voting system . 
  outside experts recommended that the estonian system [ should not have been used in the european elections ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/12/estonian-e-voting-security-warning-european-elections-research ) . 
   i could n't even check any official websites on it to check if it actually were officially required what does `` i could n't even check any official websites '' mean ? 
  was your internet connection down for the entire election season , so you could n't browse [ vaalit.fi ] ( http://vaalit.fi/ ) and read the voting instructions ? 
  to be fair , you never see the logo anywhere . 
  which is a positive thing , of course . 
  ( i think some people wear shirts with the lapuan liike colors though . ), 
  in finnish , rubbing snow on someone 's face is a * lumipesu * ( ` snow wash ' ) . 
  and lagom = sopiva ( sti ) , even though you did n't mention it . ), 
  it 's * kaukokaipuu * ( literally ` far-longing ' ) in finnish . 
  in fact , most of these german `` untranslatable '' words have finnish equivalents . 
  there is n't one . 
  are you saying there is n't a laugh track when someone says something funny ? 
  no , the current situation is the eu meddling in our lives and forcing us to use dst , unless i 'm missing something obvious . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/all/?uri=celex:32000l0084  article 2  from 2002 onwards , the summer-time period shall begin , in every member state , at 1.00 a.m. , greenwich mean time , on the last sunday in march .

  so 7 % of people believe in a jewish conspiracy but think it has the right amount of influence . 
   afterwards they turned the bodies - - for the norwegian police for investigation . 
  they actually did n't . 
  they just moved the bodies to a much easier location , 250 meters from the exit . 
  the norwegians have to do the rest , and in fact have already recovered one of the bodies . 
  they 're planning to get the other one today . 
  johan gadolin lived in turku / \u00c5bo . 
  of course it was a part of sweden at that point , but it 's ours now . 
  the finnish wikipedia calls him the father of chemistry in finland . 
  oh , yeah , i did n't notice that i was looking at the [ swedish section in wiktionary ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/danska#swedish ) . 
  ( though it makes sense that the swedish word looked correct for my explanation , since we probably got the word from them . ), 
  let 's move back to , say , the 17th century . 
  matti pekanpoika ( matti pekka 's son , so that 's a patronymic name ) builds a house and becomes a farmer . 
  the house is named mattila , and matti is known as `` matti pekanpoika mattilan talosta '' ( matti pekka 's son from the mattila house ) . 
  his son is known as `` juhani matinpoika mattilan talosta '' . 
  after a few generations , people stop using patronymics , and the family members are known as `` ville mattila '' , etc. 
  it is n't used productively to say `` matti 's place '' like you suggested . 
  although `` mummola '' = `` grandma 's house '' , 
  i think it makes sense when you consider that most finnish surnames are based on where the person lived ( either the name of the family house , or some nearby element of nature ) . 
  either the person moving from abroad picked a name like `` ruotsalainen '' , or people just called them that . 
  ( see my other comment : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1t4kzn/how_different_european_countries_are_called_in/ce4mkch ), 
  the ending - lainen / - l\u00e4inen is used to form the adjective ( `` finnish '' ) and the [ demonym ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demonym ) ( `` a finn '' ) from a place name . 
  in other contexts , the - la / - l\u00e4 ending is used to form a house name out of a given name ( matti -  mattila -- these house names have also often become surnames for the people living in the house ) , and the - ( i ) nen ending is used to form an adjective out of a noun ( viha -  vihainen = anger -  angry ) the - ( i ) nen ending is also used to create family names out of nouns , mostly ones related to nature -- possibly describing the place where the person 's family lives . 
  ( virta ( = stream ) + nen = virtanen , one of the most common surnames in finnish . ), 
   the finnish tanska for denmark is a bit more bizarre . 
  the danish word for `` danish '' is `` dansk '' ( which also has a form `` danska '' ) . 
  makes sense to me . 
  now that you mention it , in finnish most of those double vowels are either single vowels ( italia , bulgaria , slovenia , albania , espanja , armenia ... ) or have been diphtongized ( ruotsi , suomi , liettua , puola ) . 
  at least you tried , estonia :(, 
  `` ruotsalainen '' , `` suomalainen '' , `` virolainen '' , `` ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen '' and `` lappalainen '' are all more or less common surnames in finnish . 
  http://www.suomisanakirja.fi/pakkopulla it 's that bland piece of pulla ( in my experience , usually a slice of [ pullapitko ] ( http://www.myllynparas.fi/files/images/200_kuvat/pullapitko_viipaloitu_200.jpg ) ) you 're forced to eat out of politeness at a party before you can eat something that 's actually good . 
  the book source used in [ this finnish wikipedia article ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_kielen_lainasanat ) says that `` over half of loan words in finnish are from swedish or imported through it '' ( the latter meaning things like swedish forms of french/latin/greek words ) . 
  the american equivalent is requesting free bird by lynyrd skynyrd . 
   grimbergen -- a somewhat soulless fake `` abbey beer '' yeah , the fact that their `` centuries-old traditional recipe '' includes glucose syrup blew my mind .
