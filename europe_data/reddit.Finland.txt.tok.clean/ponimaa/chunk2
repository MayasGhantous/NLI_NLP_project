  i was very surprised to find the nigerian import in a small cornershop when i visited london . 
  should 've brought some with me , since it was , as you mentioned , much more interesting than regular guinness . 
   and someone still makes it the traditional way [ 4 ] , by adding hot rocks to the mash . 
  this is something one has to try if they have the chance . 
  i was lucky enough to taste it at suuret oluet , pienet panimot 2013 - i think it was sold out by the end of the first day . 
  it was delicious and , dare i say it , better than the granddaddy of all modern sahtis , lammin sahti 's sahti . 
  the finnish * kattila * ( ` pot ' ) and english * kettle * are false friends , though both can be sourced to the latin * catillus * , ` deep pan or dish for cooking ' . 
  ( edit : though that etymology for * kattila * is just my educated guess , since there are n't any proper online finnish etymology dictionaries . ), 
  well , yes , many languages have loaned words from each other through history , but that 's not what 's usually meant by `` related '' in a linguistic context . 
  and i do n't think even a high amount of loan words would warrant foliadeux6 's claim that * `` we are an odd bunch in europe '' * . 
  when in doubt , discuss the weather . 
   finnish , estonian , hungarian and ** turkish ** are related . 
  i 'm sorry , but no . 
  if you 're our linguistic cousin , you 're a very distant one . 
  the concept of [ ural-altaic languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural%e2%80%93altaic_languages ) is rejected by pretty much every modern linguist . 
  it 's sad that they 're so ashamed of us . 
  we just want to hold your * k\u00e9z * and eat some * hal * together , hungarians !, 
  yep , thanks . 
  i 'd need so much more practice to get that one right constantly . 
  ( basically i just close my eyes , use a mix of english and swedish grammar and hope for the best . ), 
  i should 've asked for your word for `` chile '' . 
  though i would 've never guessed `` t\u0161iili '' . 
  btw , jos kiina on `` hiina '' , onko kanada `` hanada '' ? 
  almost every time my late grandpa got drunk , he wanted to teach me that `` a wedding means [ trouble ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pulma ) '' . 
  ** finland ** - investigations on threats - `` you should be careful when walking outside in the dark '' - sent to member of parliament jussi halla-aho were abandoned since * `` it is common knowledge that walking around town is associated with , for example , the risk of accident . 
  warnings or reminders of this are not punishable under criminal law . 
  '' * ( the other reason was that the threats were made from a prepaid phone number so they could n't track down the sender . ), 
  - the ministry of finance suggested introducing tuition fees and restricting student benefits , which was shot down by the culture minister . 
  - a bear on a scooter chased a father and daughter who tried to escape . 
  ( or if you interpret the headline differently , `` a bear chased a father and daughter who tried to escape on a scooter '' , but where 's the fun in that ? ), 
  - the vaasankatu street in helsinki , famous for its cheap bars and `` massage parlors '' was temporarily turned into a pedestrian zone for the summer . 
  drivers responded to the change by continuing to drive there , until access was blocked more thoroughly . 
  - people were glad to hear that several waste management professionals sentenced for dumping waste into storm drains and beaches had found new careers despite their crimes . 
  that is , new careers in waste management . 
  there 's at least one famous kivi , comic artist [ kivi larmola ] ( http://www.like.fi/kirjailija/larmola-kivi ) . 
  k\u00e4py does sound weird , but it 's also extremely rare : a few k\u00e4pys every few decades , if i 'm reading the statistics correctly . 
  mika < mikael from the hebrew mikhael ( archangel michael ) . 
  teemu from the greek nikodemus . 
  as for foreign influences through the millennia , check out wikipedia : [ finnish language - borrowing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_language#borrowing ), 
  a nice story . 
  ( and a typical finn ? ), 
  it 's a shame his name was n't written down properly , so there 's little hope of finding any information on his later adventures . 
  ( `` makapaltis '' should obviously be something like `` m\u00e4kipelto '' . ), 
  in many similar cases , we just spell those foreign words like the original language does and then pronounce them however we want . 
  you mentioned `` genre '' . 
  we spell it `` genre '' and pronounce it ... [ genre ] . 
  finnish also uses them for things like '' \u0161ampoo '' and '' \u0161akki '' . 
  except nobody actually uses those spellings , and it 's always `` shampoo '' and `` shakki '' . 
  this motivated me to check the estonian word for chess . 
  i would 've never guessed that it 's * `` male '' * . 
  let 's say that afrikaans started to diverge from dutch in the 17th century . 
  if modern afrikaans sounded more like 17th century dutch than modern dutch sounds like 17th century dutch , would that mean that afrikaans is an older language than dutch ? 
  ( for the sake of this argument , it does n't really matter a ) when the languages actually diverged or b ) how much afrikaans actually sounds like older forms of dutch . ), 
  i have n't studied estonian either , but are n't some of the grammatical cases identical in the written form but pronounced slightly differently ? 
  ( edit : replaced `` case endings '' with `` grammatical cases '' to make my point clearer ) also , three possible phonetic lenghts instead of the finnish two . 
  * ei * is the [ negative verb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_verb#uralic_languages ) . 
  you truly are thinking in the long term !, 
  as far as i understand , it would be a huge oversimplification to blame the decline of rome on one factor , especially as abstract as `` subjectivism '' . 
  cato 's republic did n't last either , so it 's strange to name him a success and the empire a failure . 
  anyway , i 'm very skeptical on what sort of lessons we can learn from these ancient nations . 
  do n't get run over by barbarians , yes , but that 's not a very concrete plan . 
  luckily there are n't as many barbarians any more . 
   because no society in history stayed strong and vigorous after submitting to subjectivism . 
  nobody ever created an empire on top of a subjectivist society nor saved one . 
  only duty-oriented , dominant thinking socities did . 
  could you provide us with historical examples of these subjectivist societies and duty-oriented societies ? 
  it 's obvious that we 're thinking of very different future scenarios . 
  i think most challenges should be fought through technological , cultural and economical innovation and social freedom , not through strict control . 
  case in point , more freedom to sexual minorities means more potential academic immigration from western countries , as well as less brain drain to other countries . 
   this again sounds very subjectivist - we can not imagine anything worse than individual suffering in the present or near term ? 
  you said you wanted a society with a common goal . 
  it seems that minimizing human suffering is a more popular goal in our society than having a strong nation based on strict family values . 
   well i do n't want to break tradition and do n't want more equality . 
  why does everybody seems to want it ? 
  i guess people who want more equality are either suffering from inequality , or sympathize with those who are . 
  it seems you do neither . 
  although i understand that your ideas make sense in the context of current hungarian politics . 
  ( yes , i reddit-stalked you to deliver this questionable ad hominem . 
  boom . ), 
  looking at jokuga 's posting history , `` dear internet , please do my homework for me '' seems to be a recurring trend . 
  i love how practically all the finnish etymologies they have are incorrect . 
  ** suomi ** / suomenselk\u00e4 : [ * `` the name suomi ( finnish for `` finland '' ) has uncertain origins , but a candidate for a cognate is the proto-baltic word * \u017aem\u0113 , meaning `` land '' . 
  '' * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland#etymology ) ** not ** from the finnish * suo * , swamp . 
  ** finland ** : [ unknown ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomi#nimi ) , but since * suomi * does n't have anything to do with swamps , i guess this one 's false too . 
  ** karjala ** : [ possibly * karja * in the obsolete meaning of `` group of warriors '' ] ( http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk129/karjala_mika.shtml ) , ** not ** the modern meaning of * karja * , cattle . 
  ** helsinki ** : [ from the swedish h\u00e4lsingland ] ( http://www.kysy.fi/kysymys/mika-helsinki-nimen-alkupera ) , but the goose has nothing to do with it . 
  and here 's [ h\u00e4lsinglands etymology in swedish ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a4lsingland#etymologi ) just to be sure . 
  ** tampere ** : [ traditionally thought to come from the swedish * damber * , but some sami explanations seem more likely . ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/tampere#nimen_tampere_etymologia ) . 
  ** not ** from the finnish * tammi * , oak . 
  ** oulu ** : [ possibly a dialectal word for `` floodwater '' . 
  could be sami too . ], 
  ( http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml ) ** not ** a finnish word for * water , river * as they claim . 
  ** turku ** : [ from the old russian word for marketplace , * turgu * . 
  ] ( http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/turku/turku_komm.shtml ) ** not ** from swedish . 
  \u00c5land might be correct ( or not ) . 
  \u00d6sterbotten is correct , but obviously the swedish name for the place , not the finnish . 
  in finnish too . 
  if you read further , it also includes quotes by several current and former perussuomalaiset mps and even the party leader timo soini . 
  and yes , they 're real quotes . 
  a few are out of context , but most are n't .
