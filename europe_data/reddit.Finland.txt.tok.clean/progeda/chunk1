sweden , to answer ops question . 
  same reasoning . 
  le master trole back to kc, 
  they 're obviously being facetious, 
  you 're from oulu ? 
  i guess i can understand your mindset :d, 
  could be those extremely low paying jobs . 
  e : i heard a german explain the employing scheme here . 
  technically you 're employed but the pay is next to nothing . 
  finns drink only moderate amounts of alcohol , below the european average . 
  that 's not going to work . 
  vodka 's not nearly as popular as swedish jokes make it out to be . 
  call us swedes or russians , that 'll work . 
  * baby names, 
  no , no history books refer to finland as any sort of a colony because it does n't fit the definition . 
  finland was not a colony , it was natural part of the swedish kingdom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_proper the definition of a colony seems to be lost on people . 
  a colony is supposed to be distinct from the home territory of the sovereign , which finland was not . 
  it 's just language , and even then it 's not like it 's even close . 
  there 's no cultural link between finland and hungary , most just artificial ones back from when the linguistic links were considered to be more important . 
  same for sweden . 
  and not just for nature but in general . 
  if my aunt had balls , she 'd be my uncle, 
  well ... http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/102pv1/finnish_milk_valio_commercial/, 
  i believe the 17 % refers to this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/functional_illiteracy, 
  that 's what we 're using now , super charged ferries . 
  do n't mention it . 
  i do n't know alot of people who admit to liking it , let alone eating it more that once a year . 
  not sure how that is qualified to be a ` national dish ' . 
  most people who eat it eat it once a year during easter , after which they remember how terrible it tastes and forget about it for about 360 days . 
  is there a `` tax '' for foreigners ? 
  using `` 2.50 - 6.99 '' kind of skews the image . 
  the overall rate is 1.6 and in the regions that stand out it 's barely 2.50 . 
   or inherit each other they can . 
  well that 's a dodgy article . 
  he has said no such thing . 
  yes we have a subject `` religion '' . 
  it starts off christianity heavy with tales about jesus and his actions , then gradually goes further into world religions . 
  if you are not religiously affiliated you can study ethics . 
  however most who are not members of the church still choose religion studies . 
  i thought it was okay , learning about world religions and cultures is important . 
  looking back today i would have preferred ethics but it was not up to me . 
  registered voters ? 
  the people apologizing on / r/europe for the way their country voted was quite cringe worthy . 
  kind of emphasised what 's approved here and what 's not . 
  fair enough . 
  but mainly tax ~ ~ evasion ~ ~ avoidance, 
  literally scandi circlejerk polandball, 
  [ at least finns came mainly from the west and south ] ( http://www.hs.fi/english/article/study+isolated+finns+have+unique+genes/1135254757770 ) . 
  eastern influence is not from so far away . 
  but like op said , there 's no single population . 
  do n't they do things mainly on a state level , so i do n't see size being a problem . 
  i think this ( polish ) song and performance is just cheap . 
  by 1938 finland was certainly not poor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita#europe_1830.e2.80.931938_.28bairoch.29, 
   i 'm surprised how strong finland is . 
  i was n't  explains why there are so many unemployed people with degrees though because of this among other reasons . 
  but mainly it 's not really new that finns tend to strive for long education and high degrees . 
  finland ca n't really compete with a large and cheap workforce like many countries can . 
   winning everything from the press freedom index i do n't see a scandinavian country at the top , ) ^ ^ being ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ ^ anal, 
  per capita finns drink less than europeans on average but yeah , it 's easy to say the relationship with alcohol is complex . 
  tons of regulation combined with a binge drinking culture is a interesting mix . 
  so close , netherlands . 
  many very different languages are related but yeah , the relation with finnish and hungarian is greatly exaggerated . 
  it 's 1.6 for finland, 
  that 's just a silly map . 
  got ta take those vitamin d suppliments, 
  worked on chrome for me . 
  there will be a full 2 hour special tonight which will be later available on areena.yle.fi ( or arenan.yle.fi if you like ), 
  / r/polandball / is that way,

  ` inlan !, 
  screw freedom , time to reclaim our coffee title !, 
  interesting , i 'd like to see all european countries have direct democracy for a test period . 
  it would quite candidly show what values the different countries have . 
  i guess but the original poster was talking about scandinavians and not exclusively about swedes . 
  i was speaking from own experience too and linked the picture afterwards , 
  a picture of children is hardly relevant . 
  i 'd say less than half of scandinavians are blonde , but not by much [ this seems to be about right ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bcukriy.png ), 
  it 's interesting because you would n't necessary believe it considering there 's next to no street or organized crime and very little property crime . 
  it 's not really something that impacts the life of peole who do not live on the fringes of society . 
  but i think the typical homicide case has been described above . 
  i guess it depends who you compare it to does it seem high , it 's about half the european average . 
   after reaching their respective goals , the finns halted their advance and started moving troops to east karelia . 
  [ 34 ] [ 35 ] for the next three years , the finns did little to contribute to the battle for leningrad , maintaining their lines . 
  [ 36 ] their headquarters rejected german pleas for aerial attacks against leningrad [ 37 ] and did not advance farther south from the svir river in occupied east karelia ( 160 kilometres northeast of leningrad ) , which they had reached on 7 september  after the war , ryti stated : `` on august 24 , 1941 i visited the headquarters of marshal mannerheim . 
  the germans aimed us at crossing the old border and continuing the offensive to leningrad . 
  i said that the capture of leningrad was not our goal and that we should not take part in it . 
  mannerheim and the military minister walden agreed with me and refused the offers of the germans . 
  the result was a paradoxical situation : the germans could not approach leningrad from the north ... '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_leningrad#finnish_participation it 's in the interest of russians to claim that finns participated in the siege of leningrad , but that does n't make it true . 
  `` okay '', 
  i guess that depends on who is making it but nordic coffee is typically very lightly roasted . 
  possibly a self-deprecating comment referring to that . 
  summary of the video for a finn ? 
  europe really needs a big tech player , seems like we 're falling behind at this point . 
  if it 's finnish again , i wo n't object . 
  i 'm sure things are said in jest about the effeminate nature of swedish men but to compare us the russians in this respect , there 's no way . 
  the things you hear from russia are sickening and it 's pretty hurtful to hear that swedes might think this about finns . 
   as afraid of gays as the russians that 's ... so incredibly unfair and incorrect . 
  only germany , finland and luxemburg left . 
  could n't imagine that happening there tbh .
