  i mean invading people 's personal space like that , and no queues . 
  * shudder *, 
  upvoted ? 
  really ? 
  i swear this subreddit is like a offshoot of krautchan , yet somehow even shittier . 
   sweden - it 's like a country version of / r/shitredditsays so , this happened too . 
  a traditional pastry apparently has a nazi message . 
  these comments ... 
  it 's all very distant tho , as evident in these maps, 
  20eur ( 27 dollars ) for truly unlimited 4g and enought free minutes and text so that i never get a bigger bill . 
  3g connection would be about 5 euros cheaper . 
  what a terrible story . 
  the kid looks like a average finnish kid which only makes it feel more impactful . 
  swedish is n't a foreign language . 
  german should probably be the language for finland . 
  had no idea we were so active in and out compared to our nordic neighbours . 
  i guess the word 's out on finnish education . 
  at least in finland the `` bible belt '' has the lowest numbers . 
  it follows it quite faithfully . 
  i 'm afraid it 's not as painful as you might wish . 
  cuts to the welfare state for example are very minor , it 's quite a sensationalized title . 
  [ 63 percent of finns want swedish to be an elective subject in the schools . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/over_60_of_finns_want_swedish_to_be_an_elective_subject/6792851 ) i 'm sure the `` nationalists '' want it too , but it 's a widely supported opinion . 
  in fact the opinion is supported most in western finland which is traditionally home to swedish speaking finns . 
  i suppose any nordic country would do . 
  ca n't say i 'm unhappy where i am right now . 
   first country to give women the vote i believe that was new zealand , but finland was the first country to give women the universal right to vote and stand for election . 
  edit : first in europe , that 's true, 
  much , much earlier than year 500-600 . 
  it 's literally thousands of years . 
  finns have no special genetic realtion to hungarians these days . 
  brought legally , sold illegally ? 
  e : what ? 
  you can bring x amound of alcohol legally buy you ca n't resell it . 
   without the ability to socialize and talk to each other \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  i suppose it has to with openness about various aspects of sexuality . 
  there was an american [ study ] ( http://www.bradley.edu/dotasset/163308.pdf ) which placed finns as the most ` promiscuous ' people , but it did n't just deal with promiscuity but with how liberal people 's sexual attitudes were . 
  i believe people were rated by ` sociosexuality ' . 
  admittedly people are pretty open to casual sexual relationships here . 
  the swedish education system is not in a great shape . 
  students are performing poorly in international comparisons and people are not happy with the state of the schools . 
  aaaand we 're live . 
  50k signatures . 
  well done fellow finns , i 'm thoroughly impressed . 
  it 's quite simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias, 
  finnish and nordic first but european is up there . 
  maybe i misunderstood you at be beginning , but a finnish passport will be very helpful going about in europe none the less . 
  seems the only problem you have for now is money . 
  and being minor and all . . that should post some pretty obvious issues with this whole plan . 
  seeing as how your mother is finnish , there should be no problem for you to get finnish citizenship . 
  as a finnish citizen you 're also a eu citizen and that should open up a world of options for you . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_nationality_law as for the problem with making money , i ca n't really help with that . 
  i do n't think the author is particularity versed in finland 's and sweden 's history . 
  it seems to be a bit too more complex for me to understand . 
  consoles be which ever they may be i can get a 2 year warranty on them , depending on the store . 
  you do get it . 
  a quick check reveals that the data is a bit inconsistent on official sources ( retail stores ) , but you should get the 2 year warranty without much of an effort . 
  personally i 'm interested why retailers do n't explicitly reveal the true extent of the warranty . 
  tax included + 1 year additional warranty to comply with european laws . 
  that 's the extent that i 'm aware of . 
  that 's ... pretty random, 
  20 euros for 100 megs symmetrical . 
  a fairly common offering in urban areas . 
  a gigabit connection is available for 50 euros a month for the first year , 99 euros after . 
  i see no reason to get one tho . 
  worst broadband i 've seen is about 35e for 8/1 adsl in some rural areas . 
  those swedish young people . . 
  i 've been warning people all along how they can be . 
  you do n't really need money here to move out so as long as your papers with the social service agencies in order , you 're free to go . 
  if you do n't have a job you 'll get most of your rent paid on top of your usual benefit . 
  ~ 500 euros + 80 % of your rent . 
  it covers plenty , like housing and nourishment . 
  saying it does n't cover anything sounds pretty uninformed . 
  at least he has posted links to some of his comments on ylilauta under the german flag . 
  he 's asking for translations and upvotes . 
  ylilauta or krautchan i do n't know if there really are many trolls but there 's one german guy that 's pretty dedicated . 
  he 's behind mongol_winter , ufustratedbro and all sorts of usernames . 
  e : most recently spurdospardesporolol apparently, 
  there 's still * some * snow left . 
  that would be finland http://i.imgur.com/bcukriy.png, 
  [ numbers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bcukriy.png ) seems about right for finland . 
  there 's a second page somewhere but i ca n't find it . 
  blurmany, 
  snow has mostly melted . 
  average net monthly salary is 351 euros ? 
  that 's pretty nuts, 
  that 's not going to help property value, 
  well , europe is a large place . 
  partially due to the downturn with nokia finland is absolutely chock full of startups at the moment . 
  currently 2 of the top 3 earning apps on the itunes store are from finnish startups . 
  and neither of the are from rovio , mind you . 
  cher is dead ? 
  he 's not finnish , he 's a german that frequents a certain popular imageboard . 
  he asks for translations and troll subjects there . 
  or at least used to . 
  the plan here in finland is 100mbps availability for everyone by 2015 . http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/10/finland-plan-for-universal-100mbps-service-by-2015-on-track/ currently they 're expecting 95 percent by 2015 . 
  they mention wireless so for rural regions it 'll undoubtedly mean lte and we 'll see how fast that ends up being . 
  personally i 'm set already , considering i have gigabit available for me right now . 
  and so it did , i 'm thoroughly impressed . 
  there really is n't much corruption , hence why such a small case like this makes national headlines .
