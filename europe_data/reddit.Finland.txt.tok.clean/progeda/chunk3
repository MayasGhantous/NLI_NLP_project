  and that 's good , it 's good that people are sensitive to the subject . 
  keeps corruption from becoming prevalent . 
  as long as finland is not a part of it but a part of a nordic union . 
  open sandwich with cheese , ham , salad at least , coffee sometimes porridge if i have berries ready to go with it, 
  i bet then it would be 100 %, 
  ca n't think of anything . 
  i do n't think we 're allowed to be too patriotic . 
  it certainly is n't our national anthem . 
  maybe the finlandia hymn in some way . 
  that 's consensus-mindedness for you . 
  and he was met with an axe http://jeesuksenjaljissa.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/henrik-ja-lalli-ekman1.jpg, 
  i always take finns complaining about stuff with a grain of salt . 
  finns always feel the need to complain about * something * , no matter how trivial . 
  finns could be the lone beacon of light for the world civilization and they 'd still complain like no tomorrow . 
  economy and austerities youth mental health was a big discussion recently , but has quieted down a bit . 
  we drink a ton of coffee that people from outside of the nordics will think tastes terrible . 
  very lightly roasted and acidic . 
  dark rye bread all the way . 
  blood pancakes . 
  yes , that 's a thing . 
  loving all the butthurt . 
  ghosts are pretty scary . 
  do n't come to finland , it 's haunted !, 
  they 'll love winter . 
  that would be the finlandia hymn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandia_hymn, 
  [ a very finnish flash mob ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jakko3vgany ), 
  this , tho a mention to beer and cider as the most popular drinks for younger drinkers . 
  overall beer is by far the most popular . 
  ... lol, 
  criminals are anti-social , people avoiding social contact are asocial e : was explained, 
  who are you ? 
  never has finland been high in obesity . 
  you have to be quite fat to be obese , maybe you 're thinking overweight, 
  branding branding branding . 
  [ well hello ] ( http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2016_06/968981/zoolander-blue-steel-ben-stiller-today-tease-160210_7c8b81230f9e67ef5868e5b96e3ced9a.jpg ), 
  import kebab, 
  well , not so much disposable as he has a mortgage and all, 
  i remember my father saying when i moved out that you 're taking ours right ? 
  got ta have that moccamaster i guess . 
  it 's fairly cheap , cheaper than kesko line stores but not as cheap as lidl . 
  prismas generally do not look as nice as kesko stores, 
  it 's standard for every home in finland . 
  if you have any self respect that is . 
  heh , so many students and other 20 somethings in this thread . 
  he 's living a perfectly normal life for a middle class person living in a smaller town . 
  so many people here are one of each , poor , student , urban or just from a poorer country . 
  you could n't live like this with 30k a year in a city obviously . 
  [ finnish doge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_spitz ), 
   svt was n't the media in sweden supposed to be hiding this stuff ? 
  lol , why is the finnish one a sami dress here are the various traditional dresses of finland : http://www.kansallispuvut.fi/paikkakunnat.htm, 
  it 's great , even comparatively . 
  interesting story . . 
  i take this ferry very often for work and it 's hardly ever eventful . 
  just some tired hungover people and people trying to kill 2 hours putting around . 
  yet finland has one of the lowest electricity costs if you think it 's much then the rest of europe is paying more, 
  not bad at all . 
  you 'd have to commit some serious fraud against the social services to lose your benefits so it 's not easy to become homeless . 
  how so ? 
  when so many things about society are in good order there 's a way to live a stress free life . 
  we do n't really drink uht, 
  plat blonde sure , but not all blonde, 
   2.50 - 6.99 terrible key mostly . 
  makes it look way more dramatic than it actually is . 
  natively finnish and swedish , fluent in english , can carry a conversation in german . 
  affirmative action . 
  i could n't imagine us adopting it . 
  this came to mind with the recent yale video . 
  e : i 'm aware it exists in some forms , like in finland swedish speakers have an edge when getting accepted to universities . 
  norwegian adds a bunch of additional costs so i guess that 's what he meant . 
  cargo and all that . 
   `` in the nordic countries and in estonia '' nice try op , 
  only 2 in helsinki from 2013 - 2015, 
  there 's a lunch restaurant near me that offers gourmet level lunches for only 10 $ . 
  i 'd consider that cheap . 
  the golden age of the internet is over soon some would say it 's been over , i know i 'll remember the late 90s/early 2000 fondly . 
  we / int /, 
  the ` wealth ' in scandinavia has to do with how people buy homes . 
  lots of debt , paying off debt selling the home , and being in debt again with a new home . 
  it can be cheaper than renting just paying the interest . 
  you do n't know that finland is nordic ? 
  bassoradio http://www.basso.fi/ they have great 2 hour shows in the evenings with different electronic/urban music styles . 
  international listener friendly with most shows with minimal banter , some in english . 
  praise ukko , christians be gone !, 
  science disagrees with you https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22643754, 
  yeah , i read an article about the quality of coffee that finland imports and it 's pretty much down the line the highest quality beans . 
  the article talked about the price of coffee in finland . 
  ... and of course a home is n't a home without a moccamaster, 
  pls, 
  i you believe the / r/europe narrative estonians would be 200 % regular finns are quite indifferent while sweden is the most important country, 
  finland was n't a colony :(, 
  where does the negativity come from ? 
  so what if they 're systematically planted , i 've been to such forests and they 're plenty diverse . 
  it 's terrible brand, 
  bless your heart, 
  that german guilt, 
  there 's not exactly a big difference between nordic and scandinavian, 
  20 euros for 100/100 i 'd say average is ~ 30 euros or so that also provides a free 4g sim with unlimited data, 
  nice meme but if you answer anything other than sweden you 're being delusional, 
  bless your heart, 
  less than 2 % market share and constant cash flow problems .
