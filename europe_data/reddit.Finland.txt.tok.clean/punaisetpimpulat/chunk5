  in english , you usually keep the spelling and that 's one of the reasons why spelling contests exist . 
  and dragonish behavior too . 
  they are some serious killers . 
  that reminds me of the swedish word gr\u00f6nsaker = green things = vegetables . 
  roughly like that , except with actual real names . 
  once i checked a list of japanese politicians and found numerous odd names that would work well in a comedy . 
  or stream/current horsey . 
  it does live in water , which could flow in some direction . 
  it has four leggs and is approximately the size of a horse so ... 
  i suppose similar reasoning lead to the word appelsin = apple + china = some fruit from china . 
  great examples , and funny too . 
  i 've always thought the expression $ 20m and $ 58b were just crazy nonsense and a relic of the ancient times . 
  si can solve problems like that . 
  that 's a pretty solid answer and i totally understand the historical reasons . 
  however , i think that in the modern world we should unify the notation systems . 
  it would be better to have just one consistent system like the si . 
  it would be delightful to see si prefixes with currencies . 
  some japanese names are excellent material for finnish comedies too . 
  there are some very strange connections i can not explain . 
  konna can also be understood to refer to a toad , you know , like rupikonna . 
  and now you ca n't unsee it . 
  i wonder if vacations work the other way around . 
  you get 4000 $ for spending a two weeks in madeira or kreeta . 
  if that 's the case , this arrangement might just work after all . 
  you 've got to have a few vacations every now and then so that you can afford to work in estonia . 
  man , this map sucks . 
  op should have just written `` it 's complicated '' instead of zero . 
  yep . 
  run for your life when you see a granade and when it 's too late , just accept the fact that you 've been sitting in your own grave all this time . 
  they infuriate europeans more than pounds . 
  just check the number of downvotes i 'm getting if you 're in any doubt . 
  [ and convoluted ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/comparison_of_pounds.svg ), 
  i thought you used fourthnights to measure time . 
  same thing in sweden and finland too . 
  i wonder if other `` zero wage '' countries have the same situation . 
  i wonder if that 's also the caes in finland . 
  there are so many unions , so i ca n't really imagine any job where there would not be an agreement between somoe union and the employers . 
  it 's common practice to refer to those agreements all the time . 
  in some jobs you do n't even have to tell what the wage is , because everyone knows it 's as low as possible and terefore it 's exactly what it says in that agreement . 
  unions have these highly visible negations every now and then and sometimes the unions are n't happy with the proposals of the employers , so they arrange strikes . 
  not too long ago pilots were on strike , then the medical doctors then food delivery workers etc. 
  nearly every year you hear about some negotiations or strikes . 
  so it 's true finland has n't got a fixed minimum wage you could put on a map like this . 
  however , in practice every job i can imagine has a minimum wage . 
  they are n't the same across every filed or profession and they are n't the same evey year , so putting an inconveniently long list on this map might be the only way to avoid using a plain zero . 
  what 's wrong with rubles ? 
  because that 's the only consistent and sensible way to represent numbers and units . 
  that 's what you do with kilometers , micrograms , cubic meters , milliliters , watts , hetz , volts etc. 
  [ here 's an example ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/ale_j3_291214tm_uu.jpg ) [ and another one ] ( https://yle.fi/aihe/sites/aihe/files/migrated/kkuluttaja/munahinta.jpg ) however , these guys do n't know how to write si units in proper case , but at least the value preceedes the unit . 
  edit : spell i can not .

  i have no idea who invented it , but the same word got google transalted into finnish too . 
  and even if they did , they would be blind and deaf to the hilarious words surrounding them . 
  finnish has similar words too .

  i tend to just ignore them , because upon hearing such a word , i think of the meaning , not the words . 
  i always thought that `` butterfly '' and `` dragonfly '' are a bit strange , but i suppose native english speakers probably have n't even noticed . 
  then what does the baltic sea look like ?

  but monarchs do participate in various ceremonies and public events that people enjoy, 
  sounds very much like the summer in sodankyl\u00e4 , ivalo and other towns in lapland . 
  this has happened in other monarchies as well . 
  immediately when the king or queen relinquished all political power to the parliament , their popularity spiked up permanently . 
  i 've seen some odd similarities between the way finns behave and the way people in hot countries behave . 
  when you need to go somewhere , you start the car and leave it running for a while and go back indoors . 
  in finland we do that to with the heat turned to the max and people in hot countries do a similar thing with ac . 
  in a small town you could actually leave the car running in the parking lot of the supermarket while you go shopping for groceries . 
  ( no , really . 
  i 've seen this happen ! ), 
  the behacior of people changes according to the daily/annual temperature cycle . 
  when its tolerable , people go outdoors , meet people , hang out at parks and ejoy life . 
  when it 's intolerable , people just stay indoors and enjoy the heating or ac , depending on which part of the world you 're talking about . 
  i 'd be curious to know if my observations apply in the hot parts of us ? 
  i wonder if you could push that brexit-negotiation-score even closer to zero , or perhaps even past it ? 
  how come this is n't on r/calligraphy already ? 
  this script looks a lot like fraktur , but it has a number of unique features , so i 'm not 100 % sure what to call it . 
  all the more reason to fly long distances where norwegian privides services . 
  busses are a viable option in shorter distances . 
  is it desert dry or jungle humid in there ? 
  that argument should work for trains too . 
  vr is very creative with these things . 
  it 's too cold , too hot , too much snow , too rainy , too windy ... 
  they 'll always come up with something to explain why the trains are late or do n't even move at all . 
  oh , so norway and sweden form an island . 
  til . 
  and that 's just one of the things that wreck our immigrants . 
  it 's mind blowing at first , but gets old pretty fast when you do n't see the sun at 16.00 or when it 's cold and rainy for about half of the year . 
  eventually they get fed up with the inconsistent , but usually miserable , weather and move elsewhere . 
  i hear the immigrants in uk were n't too bothered by the consistent rain . 
  perhaps it just was n't cold and miserable enough . 
  btw how 's the immigrant situation in northern scotland ? 
  try kuwait for a change : http://www.met.gov.kw/forecasts/kuwait.php it 's regularly around 40 ... 45 \u00b0 c. 
  it 's a common mistake to mess up the crosses . 
  wrong aspect ratio . 
  the saint patrick 's saltire is all wrong . 
  quite so sir , only myself and the rest of the english speaking world is to know . 
  and biting midges . 
  you can still sort of deal with the mosquitoes , but the midges are an order of magnitude worse .
