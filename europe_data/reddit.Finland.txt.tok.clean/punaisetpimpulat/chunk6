  all you can do is wait for the summer to end . 
  in the back of my head i kind of knew there has to be a catch hidden somewhere . 
  but you could have trusted friend in that country a , get a cheap contract in their name and use it in country b , where you prefer to live . 
  does it last for a month or is it for longer periods of time ? 
  i feel your pain . 
  way back in the early days of mobile phones an internet connections , our prices were outrageous too . 
  the situation was such that you * could * pay for fast connections , but there was no guarantee of actually getting what you were paying for due to poor 3g coverage . 
  this lead to me making the decision to stick with 2g for as long as possible . 
  eventually few years after 2010 , the prices started to make more sense and 3g coverage was actually acceptable . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but the isp/phone/tv / etc. 
  market in the us is n't exactly free . 
  afaik , free western capitalism is n't really applied in that part of the market and you have a monopoly/oligopoly situation in which the customer suffers and progress in impeded . 
  but then again , these things have happened before . 
  lol, 
  sweet . 
  your country will be very competitive when uk is out of the game . 
  pretty much everyone will want to come there . 
  the same in finland too . 
  brilliant is n't it . 
  that might still be the case ... 
  but you get the money back when you terminate the plan . 
  i used to be on 3g for a long time , since the speed was good enough , the price was very low and i did n't actually need 4g for anything . 
  however , i was given a good discount , so i switched to 4g on my phone and my computer . 
  i 'm too busy enjoying the bliss of dna prices and discounts . 
  the university has no age limits . 
  you can be 80 and still graduate . 
  yeah , why make it more complicated than it has to be . 
  besides , simple solutions tend to be cheaper too . 
  good point . 
  you can always argue that they could have gotten a better deal . 
  they can always blame the scots , irish or some other group . 
  that 's a pretty good deal for most people . 
  nowadays people do n't text as much as they used to 10 years ago . 
  also , the 20 gb should be enough for most normal people who are n't watching videos all the time . 
  all that will be over soon . 
  they will have to find some other scapegoat . 
  how about when sitting in a metro ? 
  come to study in finland and sign up for a contract with unlimited 4g and calls . 
  i suppose the prices are around 24 $ / mon these days . 
  is n't that how politics works in real life anyway ? 
  you need to have a brown nose and a convincing speeches in order to be a successful politician . 
  that selection process leads to a very distorted sample of people who we actually see on the main stage . 
  i would say the answer is about . .5.05 mg ( read as point point five point oh five micro gallons ) .

  they have a chair with four legs . 
  traditional agricultural settings had three legged chairs and they did n't have any arm rests either . 
  therefore , these moderators are city folks , not cow milking farmers . 
  it 's absolutely fabulous . 
  once you 've tried it , there 's no turning back . 
  trust me , it is . 
  the addiction is irreversible . 
  you think that was amazing ? 
  you should try [ lakritsi jogurtti ] ( http://www.alandsmejeriet.fi/tuotteet/alands-lakritsi-jogurtti-1kg/ ) . 
  currently true . 
  however , if you read old cookbooks you 'll find that it 's mostly vegetarian food . 
  meat was unfathomably expensive , so we just ate the things we could grow ourselves or gather in the forest . 
  fish was relatively easily available too , so non-veggie foods usually contained fish . 
  oh , now i ca n't unsee it . 
  thanks . 
  standard tactics . 
  immediately before a battle you have your cleric , mage , druid and paladin cast every buff they can . 
  i wonder if he 's also going to visit that country where they worship a flag with stars on it . 
  i think wasabi ice cream could be pretty hot . 
  how about wasabi ? 
  that should mask the taste a little . 
  it is a highly questionable method . 
  some of them work , some of them do n't . 
  what usually happens is that every few years a `` new '' ingredient is introduced to the market and a massive human trial is carried out with numerous mixtures . 
  once upon a time it was chili . 
  then it was olives and now it 's salmiakki . 
  perhaps one day we 'll start mixing mango or caviar with every possible ingredient and see what happens . 
  if that ever happens , you can expect to see mango margarine or caviar lemonade available for a brief period of time . 
  usually such human trials provide pretty solid results on what 's actually edible and what 's just marketing . 
  next step : tar + m\u00e4mmmi + chili + salmiakki + < insert_food  = ??? 
  scientific terminology is known to mix greek prefixes and latin words or the other way around . 
  it 's not a splendid practice , but it happens . 
  edit : see [ teleportation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teleportation#etymology ) for an example . 
  [ did you think bagpipes were boring ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-op1mng4oy ), 
  and then we 're back to winter before you know it . 
  perhaps * tetralateration * was the word you were after ? 
  multilateration or polylateration would work too . 
  yeah , my point exactly . 
  we put salmiakki in pretty much everything these days , so why should yogurt be excluded ? 
  ice cream , candy , chocolate , yogurt ... who knows what 's next . 
  exactly the same thing happened with chili pepper a few years ago . 
  and now we have chili chocolate , chili potato chips , chili cheese , chili tuna etc. 
  although it could take a while . 
  [ the obligatory xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/725/ ), 
  i was talking about another place . 
  propaganda and education , huh ? 
  i like the symmetry . 
  is there also a position for the ministry of science and hogwash ? 
  i can vividly remember when my philosophy teacher wrote on the green board : `` this statement is false . '', 
  lol . 
  i like the double democracy in the name . 
  btw what happened to the `` republic '' ? 
  you could also add `` the '' at the beginning , just like [ the gambia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_gambia ) did . 
  the new version would be `` the democratic republic of people 's democracy littleluiistan '' . 
  you know , cgp grey made an entire series of videos explaining this topic .
