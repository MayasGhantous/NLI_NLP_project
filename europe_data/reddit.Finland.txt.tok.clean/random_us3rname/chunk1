this one came to mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugl42dbjyz0 almost 2 million views is quite a lot considering the finnish population and on top of that different spin-offs based on it such as [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wemnddluoka ) have over a million views in total . 
  i thought i should add [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhmtz4rtw1q ) . 
  it 's just some overly enthusiastic guys ice fishing no idea how it got so popular but it 's kinda funny . 
  i used to drink around 2 liters of it per day . 
  i believe it contributed to me developing an anxiety disorder . 
  the vicious circle of drinking coffee because you did n't sleep enough and not sleeping enough because you drank too much coffee while stressed out because of schoolwork is n't good for your mental health . 
  it got better and now i drink only two 3dl mugs every morning to wake me up and then some tea in the afternoon . 
  in elementary school our teacher always made the whole class pray before lunch . 
  back then i did n't really think anything about it but thinking about it now it 's kinda weird . 
  i think they still do it in some finnish schools , i 'm only 20 . 
  which is something like `` jesus please bless this meal and always be with us amen '' . 
  according to wikipedia only 27 % of finns believe in the god of christianity which makes it a rather odd convention . 
  we also went to church with school a couple times a year and had gatherings during school days where we sang religious songs and sometimes prayed . 
  what kind of makes this `` okay '' is the fact that where i went to school practically everyone was a member of the lutheran church like 75 % of finns were in 2013 . 
  even though few people actually believe in a god it 's just the norm to be a member . 
  religious education is also a mandatory subject . 
  yeah nahkuri is finnish for skinner but according to wikipedia the name kinnunen has been derived from the swedish word skinnare which does n't sound too far fetched . 
  however i was unable to find a source for this claim so who knows . 
  hey i remember you 're the finland hater guy from the thread about the speeding fine . 
  it seems you 're really dedicated . 
  keep on fighting the good fight !, 
  ez , try [ this one ] ( http://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/how-many-countries-can-you-name.php ) i was bored once so i played it until i got them all and i still remember them . 
  i would n't right now since i 'm a student but if i got a good job offer or something in the future i 'd definitely try it out . 
  i 'd probably want to move back at some point but living in the us is something i 'd be happy to try out . 
  b. . bbut i thought we were the baest ? 
  i 've honestly never heard it being called `` kissanh\u00e4nt\u00e4 '' , only `` miukumauku '' . 
  i just say '' \u00e4t '' myself . 
  yeah looks like this map is quite outdated . 
  [ spain raised their age of consent from 13 to 16 back in 2013 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/04/spain-raises-age-of-consent ), 
   there are far more effective ways than creating a forest in one of the driest places on earth . 
  numbers ? 
  examples of these better ways ? 
  make you provide some proof for your statement i 'd assume, 
  not at all , i have no idea what estonians are saying when they are speaking . 
  in writing i can recognize a word here and there and a lot of the words i think i recognize are [ false friends ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_friend ) . 
  you can sometimes kind of guess the meaning of some phrases if they 're in context though . 
  to give you an example , my attempt at translating some of the forms in the comic : koirakaan-not even a dog koirattakaan - not even without dogs koiranako-as a dog ? 
  `` ko '' ending implying a question koirinensa-with his/her dogs . 
  you get the idea ... this is called agglutination in linguistics and a lot of languages have it not just finnish . 
  many european languages do n't . 
  almost 5 % of finns speak swedish as their first language , some of them do n't speak finnish at all . 
  ahh okay i should 've known that because the same concept is widely used in finland as well , `` taajama '' in finnish . 
  finland was n't on the list but sweden is close enough . 
  i did better answering these questions about sweden than the average south korean did about their own country ... what surprised me the most was that according to this quiz only 14 % of swedes live in rural areas , i guessed 50 % so i wonder what the definition of a rural area is . 
  i can imagine swedes and other scandinavians making that mistake because in swedish `` l\u00e4ra '' is to teach and `` l\u00e4ra sig '' ( to teach yourself ? ), 
  is to learn if i remember correctly . 
  it used to confuse me when studying swedish as learning and teaching are two completely separate words in both english and finnish . 
  some of the interesting ones i get : ** finland ** : real , communist ** sweden ** : a 3rd world country , doomed ** italy ** : feminine or masculine in french ( this is actually the first suggestion ) , the most racist country in europe ** netherlands ** : part of holland ** spain ** : a police state ** denmark ** : the only country that starts with d, 
  they have the \u00f6 in k\u00f6ttbullar but missed the \u00e4 in poronk\u00e4ristys . 
  i also have to wonder what a 150kcal serving of poronk\u00e4ristys would look like ... all the calorie counts seem rather low, 
  source pls, 
  yeah , obviously . 
  we do n't , there 's not a single toll road in finland . 
  that 's a more complex subject . 
  i was n't really arguing about if this was the best solution but whether it was right in terms of freedom of religion and ethics . 
  i do n't really see how that 's fundamentally different . 
  even if it was , then how much clothing is sufficient ? 
  should it cover the genitals ? 
  is it enough to wear a sock on your dick if your religion says so ? 
  the problems does n't go away , you 're just trying to avoid it unsuccessfully . 
  what if my religion does n't allow wearing clothes at all ? 
  should i be allowed to roam the streets naked ? 
  you have to draw the line somewhere . 
  there is no single correct solution to where it should be drawn but i think covering your face in public places in the name of your religion crosses that line . 
  is n't it pretty clear by looking at recent results though ? 
  i 'm not too sure about that . 
  i mean the 100 or so european atheletes who won gold medals are the very best so even if the total number was shaved down to 600 they would all still attend , you would leave out the worse athletes obviously . 
  i 'm not sure how the selection process works so i might be wrong . 
  i remember feeling kinda average in terms of height when i visited amsterdam a few years back and i 'm 1,92 m. 
  the people were noticeably taller than people here in finland so i 'm not surprised at all by this article . 
  i can usually hold it in if i 'm sitting or standing still but if i 'm running or even walking i can only delay it for a short time . 
  i 'm not sure tbh , there might be come complex societal reasons at play . 
  finland placed 5th on this same study and i can tell you that there certainly is no culture of lying about how you feel , like you proposed , here . 
  quite the opposite it 's a widespread stereotype that we 're suicidal and depressed and people often joke about it . 
  i feel like asking how someone is doing as a part of the usual small talk is very different from having someone take part in a survey on their level of happiness . 
  sure if someone casually asks me how i 'm doing i 'm probably going to say that i 'm fine or okay even if i 'm truly depressed . 
  if i 'm taking part in a survey as a part of a study of course i 'm going to tell how i really feel . 
  according to the [ finnish meteorological institute ] ( http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/weather/naantali ) the sun sets at 22:59 and rises at 4:05 in naantali today . 
  i do n't think this picture taken at 2am . 
  it was too hot to go out , like 22c or something crazy . 
  i 'd rather stay indoors . 
   best highly subjective, 
  goddamn loch ness monster !, 
  i actually just met some romanians working here . 
  i 've heard this kind of arrangement being called `` sponsorship '' in finnish lol, 
  the only norwegian city i 've been to . 
  seeing the mountains up there was just mindblowing to me . 
  i do n't think i had seen anything that high before in my life . 
  heh you managed to misspell two out of those three words . 
  it 's okay though , your finnish is already better than my german, 
  take that sweden and norway !, 
  finnish city of jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 is on pretty much the same latitude as yellowknife , canada . 
  it 's +1 c in jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 right now and -31 c in yellowknife . 
  thanks gulf stream . 
  i assume you 're thinking of kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen , you 're just missing the \u00e4 and \u00f6, 
  when i was in elementary school we had to walk like 2km to the nearby swedish speaking school every saint lucy 's day to see the show . 
  that 's how i learned to hate it . 
  first off true finns is a rather poor translation of the original finnish name for the party `` perussuomalaiset '' , a better translation would be `` basic finns '' or something like `` everyday finns '' so your first point does n't really make sense . 
   has there been an actual proposal to replace the exact amount of swedish taught in finnish schools with the language of the pupil 's choice ? 
  then you ca n't claim that that is the sole reason for the true finns arguments against swedish education .
