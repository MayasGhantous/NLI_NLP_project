  french bigotry against other languages merely demonstrates their own lack of civilization . 
  going to bed and too lazy to search for dates , but iirc it goes something like this : 1 . 
  the languages of the first settlers after the ice age 8000 bce ( and the last descendants of these only died out in the early first millennium ce after sami languages spread into lapland and borrowed place names from these languages . ), 
  additional unknown paleo-european language ( s ) later on , again leaving behind loan words 3 . 
  north western indo-european dialect 4 . 
  possibly a uralic language that went extinct later 5 . 
  roughly the same distance to both i think , but you 'd be better off asking someone who studies those things .

  according to a recent survey 37 % of finns believe in the god of the lutheran church , 3 % in the god of some other religious doctrine , 21 % in some other higher power , 27 % believe in neither a god nor any other higher power and 11 % were n't sure . 
  lutheran church membership is currently at 71.9 % and has been going down by 0.5-1 .5 each year since 2003 when the freedom of religion act was amended to allow resigning church membership by written notice ( previously you had to personally visit a registry office ) .

  ] ( http://www.kb.se/dokument/om/organisation/nordin,%20monetary%20boundaries%201809.pdf )  the relationship between sweden and finland was multifaceted . 
  although there is no doubt that swedes and finns were regarded as separate nations and sweden and finland were often treated as two amalgamated entities , there are no predetermined conclusions to be drawn from this . 
  on an individual level many people born in finland most certainly did not regard themselves as different from any other swedish subjects , and most people on both sides regarded finland as naturally belonging to sweden . 
  nevertheless there was an ambiguity between sweden and finland which is not comparable to the relation between any other parts of the realm .
