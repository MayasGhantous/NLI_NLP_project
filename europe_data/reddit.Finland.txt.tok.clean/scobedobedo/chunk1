in finland : i 've traveled public transport alone since i started primary school ( 7 years old , played outside since kindergarten and visited friends freely since primary school . 
  i do n't know about picking clothes , but probably somewhere between 6-9 years old , my parents have n't cared about dating and i ca n't comment on going to the shop , it 's such a normal thing . 
  in high school you were allowed to eat lunch outside and visiting the bathroom needed permission during lesson time . 
  in general children and adolescents have a lot of freedom here . 
  proper finnish uses ruots - , but dialects and slang has some with sve , like svedupelle . 
  many dialects in ( south ) western finland use a lot of swedish words in general , i.e hanttaaki-handtag , hanttuuki-handduk . 
  svedupelle - `` swedish clown '' , not that harsh . 
  hurri - i decided to include this even though it is not used towards other natinonalities , but towards the swedish-speaking minority in finland . 
  ryss\u00e4 - it just means russian ( from the swedish ` ryss ' ) , but the proper term is ` ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen ' . 
  also , the word ` ryssi\u00e4 ' means to fuck up . 
  those are the only ones i can come with now , there 's probably some more . 
  well , i 'm from finland . 
  the education is of high quality and you hear english from the tv/internet very often , if you are young and know zero english then you are quite dumb . 
  serious about what ? 
  the shit pronunciation ? 
  no need for stigmatising , because they are . 
  not knowing english is quite broad though , people might have shit pronunciation , but they still know the language . 
  yes i know they have those abilities , but the powers are n't central to their respective stories , it 's just kinda an added feat . 
  to make them more comic-like ( imo at least ) . 
  and i do n't think op had a&o and lucky luke in mind when asking the question xd . 
  after doing a bit of research , i actually found a finnish [ superhero ] ( https://www.karjalainen.fi/media/k2/items/cache/b85f06d26d075fc2b861e35a7af9b3c3_xl.jpg ) . 
  and i was quite correct with my description of what the hero would be like , `` per\u00e4smies is a middle-aged , severely alcoholic homeless man living in a landfill , whose only superpower is the ability to fart supernaturally hard '' . 
  if you 'd ask a finnish cartoonist to create a character that personifies finland it would most likely be a drunk who just says `` perkele '' , and i can quite safely say that 'd be the case in most european countries ( drawing something self-deprecating ) . 
  i mean [ this guy ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/4715746/landscape16_9/567/319/2a324c932d31e91921143cd0afbc7956/lk/ctv-uuno-turhapuro-muuttaa-maalle.jpg ) is a good example . 
  the whole superhero-thing is very american , it has never been popular over here and as you can see from the comments the countries that have `` superhero '' comics are parodies . 
  the movies do sell , because it is quite good bang for your buck entertainment , but i have never , ever , seen a superhero comic being sold . 
  people just are n't interested in reading them . 
  tintin , asterix & obelix , donald duck , lucky luke are the most common comics to see in somebody 's house and donald duck has been to most read comic for decades . 
  it is not really lesser known , but the state/municipalities have really failed to capitalise on its `` uniqueness '' . 
  [ turku ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/7c/b3/d6/archipelago-national.jpg ) [ archipelago ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2688/4121326983_44cb5723fe_b.jpg ) is one of the biggest and most beautiful archipelagos in the world . 
  most probably see them as unnecessary , i mean they do n't really add anything to the discussion . 
  apartment from the 60s , pretty much in the city centre, 
  yeah , my reaction was like `` wtf why are you even asking?o.o '', 
  the nordic countries are really far ahead with data plans , internet costs and all that jazz . 
  through a quick search i found a deal for 5 $ , it gives unlimited data ( 256kbit/s , which is pretty slow ) and 0,07 $ for calls and messages . 
  this is in finland . 
  i had to actually check , cuz i was n't sure what i had xd . 
  monthly cost is 25 $ . 
  there 's pre-paid and monthly pay , but i have a contract . 
  unlimited , in its real meaning , 4g , 100mb/s max speed . 
  yes , did that last evening , unlimited . 
  600 minutes . 
  600 messages , i rarely call or text , tho . 
  yes 10gb/month in eu/eta , and before that i had free roaming in the baltics + nordics ( which i still have ) . 
  country at hand is finland . 
  i can also add that my internet at home is free of charge . 
  it is only 10 mb , but i live alone so it is enough for me , i can get 50 for 5 $ / month , tho . 
  they 're quite common and getting more common with the younger people , one reason being that fewer and fewer are actually members of any church so they ca n't marry , and most marriages are very small and fast ceremonies here anyway . 
  i 'd say they last as well , it is not like the `` marriage '' adds anything to the relationship . 
  one would choose such a thing over marriage because 1 ) you are n't a member of any church ( e.g i 'm not ) 2 ) you just do n't want to go through the hassle , money and time 3 ) marriages are relatively hard to break . 
  main difference is the `` structured '' way it works in the us vs most of europe ( i think that is what you friend is trying to say , too ) . 
  you just kinda become a partner , there are n't any clear definitions of what you are , until you clearly are together ( i.e `` person i 'm seeing '' `` a date '' `` boy/girlfriend '' etc. ) . 
  you will most likely date people from your friend-circle , work , some other place you go to and meet ( the same ) people there often and from one of your friend 's friend-circles . 
  also , sex and alcohol are involved quite heavily from the get-go . 
  possible to get examples of these anti-american comments ? 
  but , like most have commented here it is most likely just normal criticism and banter , and because this is mainly an english-speaking website you wont encounter too much of the banter which is directed towards other european countries . 
  why would i talk smack about sweden here , in english , when like 0.02 % will relate to it ? 
  rather do it in the bar with my mates . 
  yeah , [ no ] ( http://ruleoflaw.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/finland_landscape.jpg ) [ space ... ] ( http://www.traveltourismblog.com/images/finland-lapland-nature.jpg ) but to answer the question ; no they are n't as common , scouts and other similar organisations do hold camps , but that 's it . 
  same way any country , or person can sue a company , as long as that country or person has legal capacity . 
  it would hurt google way more , it would be losing the biggest market in the world to its competitors and have no replacement for it . 
  depends where in the city you are , not that often tho . 
  i 'd say there is one on every other street in the city centre , if you are outside of it you 'll have to look for one . 
  my hometown ( turku , finland ) does n't have anything called finland road/square/street , as far as i am aware , but like u/muehsam said there are roads that indicate a direction to another city , for example there is stockholm 's street , tampere 's road , helsinki 's road and some more . 
  i do n't know about the rest of country . 
  tell me tho , does the mayor have full power to change a road name , or does it have to go through some sort of a vote ? 
  the previously mentioned `` can do '' attitude is pretty much the only thing , but even that is more down to the laws and law-making in my country ( finland ) than anything else . 
  there is enough `` can do '' people here , it is just the laws that make it very hard to actually `` do '' . 
  another thing is diversity , i have lived quite an international life and i really enjoy having people from all over the world around me , you can compare , contrast and laugh at what other countries do etc.etc . 
  this is not really a us-only thing tho , more like a phenomenon that is common for all english speaking countries . 
  1 ) my country should ban islam and deport all muslims , even if they 're indigenous converts . 
  would be seen as an unacceptable view by most . 
  2 ) poor and left-of center americans have the right to use force against the government to secure their rights to healthcare . 
  stupid , would n't be acceptable . 
  3 ) violence against the us government in the name of the climate is acceptable . 
  also stupid . 
  4 ) we should work with china , india , cuba , and iran over the us and saudi arabia . 
  an acceptable opinion . 
  5 ) ending religious extremism worldwide should be part of western foreign policy . 
  depending on the context and the way it is presented , but most likely the majority would see it as a weird proposition . 
  mainly , because what is the definition of `` western foreign policy '' . 
  6 ) american republicans , including the president , should be denied entry to our country until they adopt more moderate policies . 
  stupid . 
  7 ) we should share 90 % of our income with africans , asians , and latin americans . 
  acceptable , but people would find it rather ridiculous . 
  8 ) the biggest failure of colonialism was our inability to fully westernize the natives . 
  depends on the way you present the idea . 
  can go either way , most likely to the stupid side , tho . 
  9 ) socialism and communism should be banned if they favor abolishing the right to property . 
  stupid , it is a rather weird proposition , tho . 
  10 ) we should have launched a regime change operation in syria with hundreds of thousands of nato troops . 
  i 'd say pretty much everybody would disagree on that being a good idea . 
  country : finland . 
  none would get the police called on you , why would they ? 
  you are allowed to hold your own opinions . 
  some are opinions that many openly hold , some are just weird which would give you confused looks if you 'd express them and some are just plain stupid . 
  no , they have no first hand connection with each other . 
  perhaps you should be a bit more specific with the countries you 're going to . 
  and ? 
  some ` everybody ' can be really stupid , in finland there 's a gazillion jokes about swedes and norwegians being retards , but this post is about americans , so why would i talk about some other nationality ?
