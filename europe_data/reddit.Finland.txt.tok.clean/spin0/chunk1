one !, 
  two !, 
  five !, 
   nobody knows for sure why we 're facing this situation , so it is still an open question reeks of appeal to ignorance fallacy . 
  even if you or someone else does n't know why something is happening does n't mean no one else can not know , and you not knowing does not in any way warrant fantastical explanations . 
  and indeed we do know the main reasons behind the falling oil prices . 
  the imaginary us-saudi conspiracy is not one of them , and once again the reality is much more complex than a simplistic conspiracy theory . 
   the slowing down doesnt fully explain this price fall demand and supply no one says it 's demand alone . 
  `` things are not looking good and it 's everyone else 's fault but mine . '', 
   are n't the falling oil prices a byproduct of one kind of economic sanction , though ? 
  no , they 're the result of the global supply and demand . 
  there 's many factors at play in that . 
  here 's some of those . 
  the global demand has been growing slower than expected . 
  this puts downward pressure on the oil prices for oil exporters . 
  for example , china 's demand for oil imports has n't been growing as expected , and the us domestic production has been growing rapidly at the expence of imports . 
  on the supply side you have things like : 1 . 
  the price cartel opec had planned their production expecting greater demand for their exports . 
  big exporters have been fighting to maintain their market shares . 
  for example a month ago first saudi arabia announced a price discount for exports to asia and iran quickly followed causing an additional drop in benchmark prices : [ iran , saudi arabia offer massive crude oil discounts to asia ] ( http://www.timesofoman.com/news/41020/article-iran-saudi-arabia-offer-massive-crude-oil-discounts-to-asia ) 3 . 
  rapidly growing new production especially the us tight oil : [ check out this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mcyy7q2.png ) the us exports only very little crude oil ( why ? 
  see this : [ history of controls on u.s. oil exports ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/usa-oil-export-controls-kemp-idusl6n0si37x20141023 ) ) . 
  but it is a big consumer and also a big importer . 
  as the domestic production has been rising rapidly there 's less demand for imports . 
  hence this week saudi arabia , fighting to maintain its market share in the us , announced price cuts for exports to the us : [ u.s. oil falls to 3-year low on saudi price cut ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-04/wti-extends-fall-on-saudi-price-cut-as-u-s-supply-seen-rising.html ) needless to say the announcement caused the benchmark prices to drop to record lows : wti dec futures $ 75.84 , brent dec futures $ 82.08 , and [ opec oil basket price falls below $ 80 to least in 4 years ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-05/opec-oil-basket-price-falls-below-80-to-least-in-4-years.html ) the move can also be seen as a price battle between the us tight oil producers and saudi arabia . 
  producing tight oil is a lot more costly than drilling it in saudi arabia . 
  when the prices fall the tight oil producers make less profit , or some even losses . 
  but apparently the us tight oil producers were not impressed by the saudi price cut , some even seeing it as an opportunity : [ saudi flexing met with crickets by u.s. shale frackers ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-05/saudi-flexing-met-with-crickets-by-u-s-shale-frackers.html ) 4 . 
  sooner than expected returning production , such as libya after having had production disruptions ( [ see graph ] ( http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaharamsc6jrnazftzq21ewtjqa=/700x0/filters:no_upscale%28%29/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2332936/iaee4.0.png ) ) was suddenly up by 280,000 bpd in september . 
  there are many factors behind the falling oil prices during recent months , but basically it 's just supply and demand at work . 
  there are also some conspiracy theories about the us and saudis running the show as complicits , but they 're rather silly as things in the real world are much more complex than that . 
   the local prices are staying more or less the same with the climbing inflation rate no they 're not . 
  inflation rate runs already at 8.3 % , food inflation at 11.5 % , and both are rising : [ russia inflation rate ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/inflation-cpi )  russian annual inflation rate accelerated for the third straight month to 8.3 percent in october of 2014 from 8 percent in september . 
  yet , monthly inflation recorded the highest rate in five months . 
   cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased 11.5 percent year-on-year , the same rate recorded in september . 
  in contrast , prices of housing , water , electricity and gas rose at a faster 6.4 percent in october , following a 5.8 percent increase in the previous month and mainly due to housing rents ( +12.6 percent ) and water ( +10.1 percent ) . 
  transport prices accelerated 5.6 percent ( 5 percent in september ) and health cost grew 10.2 percent . 
  additional upward pressures came from tobacco prices which recorded again the highest increase ( 27.3 percent ) . 
   on a monthly basis , consumer prices accelerated for the second consecutive month by 0.8 percent . 
  food cost advanced 1.2 percent , following a 1 percent increase in the previous month while non-food prices increased 0.6 percent . 
  exports of oil and gas make around 50 % of the gov budget , not gdp, 
  mmm ... / r/mineralporn . 
  i mean , just look at this badass galena : http://www.reddit.com/r/mineralporn/comments/2lclc2/galena_brought_to_you_by_the_letter_badass/, 
  * putchist * eurogay chechen nazi * juntas *, 
   ... i did not understand what he said . 
  same here . 
  the article appears mangled with quotes from different persons and journalist 's own interpretations . 
  yup , stealth capability is definitely a plus in the possible threat enviroment over here . 
  whatever super hornet 's merits are it 's not a candidate . 
  the initial five named candidates to be considered are : f-35a lightning ii ( perhaps with the drag chute as in norway ? ), 
  jas 39e/f gripen ( aka ng ) dassault rafale suhoi pak fa mig-35 ( plus possible dark horse candidates ) of these i 'd go with the f-35a but there 's plenty of time to evaluate them until the 2019-20 decision . 
  then again , it 's not represented as the majority of the population anyway , and additionally most redditors likely already know how netizens tend to have skewed demographics . 
  also the f-35 is designed for using short runways just as [ the f-18 is ] ( http://youtu.be/bnuvcvigkxe?t=1m38s ) . 
  and while with the jas 39 e/f there could be some befenificial synergy with sweden , with the f-35 there could be with norway and all the other countries using it . 
   it 's too early to make a decision . 
  yep . 
  and making that decision is years away anyway . 
  plenty of time to evaluate the candidates before that - some of which have n't entered service yet . 
   something that would be good to have around in the defense of finland . 
  very good jamming or stealth would both be big pluses in the possible threat enviroment over here . 
  but while the growler is very effective in its role for the us navy , i do n't think the us would sell it , and i 'm not sure how it would fit into faf doctrine anyway . 
  i do n't know . 
  what 's the point of imagining possible costs of aircrafts that have n't even entered operational use yet ? 
  i 'd say by the time the decision is to be made we have more actual information regarding the candidates in their intended role . 
  i do n't think china 's foreign policy is driven by sums that are peanuts any way you look at them . 
  if it 's of any consolence i feel for you . 
   china has a military alliance with russia . 
  cooperation = / = alliance, 
  also , already some months ago during the crimean pseudo-referendum , this was happening in chinese social media : [ netizens compare lost chinese territory to crimea crisis ] ( http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/netizens-compares-lost-chinese-territory-to-the-crisis-in-crimea.html ) those chinese netizens did n't seem to be too happy about how the red army annexed large regions of china using similar tactics including occupation and pseudo-referendums :  the russia that has never done any good ; if it 's not destroyed , then there is no justice in the world . 
  honestly , i do n't . 
  what now ? 
  well , i think it 's better to wait and see until 2019-2020 when the decision is to be made . 
  until that there 's plenty of time to evaluate the performance of the candidates in their intended roles - and to project their capabilities into possible threat enviroment over here . 
  for example , regarding the range of russia 's aa missile batteries stealth capabilities would be a plus over here but not as much over sweden . 
  atm i 'd prefer the f-35 but that may change in the future . 
  also the gripen is a good plane and certainly has a lot going for it . 
  we 'll see in few years how the jas 39e/f turns out and at what unit cost and weapons systems . 
  both f-35a and jas 39e/f are designed with ease of maintenance in mind ( modularity , ease of access ) , albeit the stealth capabilities bring some additional steps into procedures ( e.g. 
  maintaining coating , rcs testing ) , which fits into faf doctrine . 
  one big question is the available weapons systems and their compability . 
  with the f-18 the faf has advanced weapons systems such as jdam , jsow and jassm etc. 
  all those are compatible with the f-35 ( never mind the future jsm ) but the jas 39e/f would probably need replacements . 
   on behalf of russia i would like to apologize that we are not giving out free gas to everyone uhm . . no reason to apologise for that as no-one expects russian companies to do such nonsense . 
   i know its disappointing to ask money for provided services no , actually it is a reasonable thing to do . 
   but we are such an unreasonable bunch !, 
  it is the gazprom monopoly pricing and terms that are often found unreasonable . 
  i do n't think you or indeed most of the russians are unreasonable by extension . 
   we have russia taking bites out of the east , i thought it was [ china taking bites out of iceland ] ( http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/europe-iceland-chinese-billionaire-purchase-land-ownership-heirs-sell-childhood-wealthy-businessman-construction-hotel-jobs-tax-revenue-national-park-sustainable-development ) . 
   when you think that it could n't get worse rferl standards of reporting sink to new low . 
  except the company ( zefs ) actually cited homopropaganda as the reason for removing the monument in their press release . 
  which fact was reported by the rfel and also by other news media even including the notorious rt. 
   i would also like to know whether part of the deal is that the european commission would drop its investigation of monopoly behavior by gazprom in the european gas market ? 
  well , i do n't think so . 
  and apparently the writer is unable to present anything of substance to change my view . 
  so , in your opinion it is reasonable and in fact absurd . 
  or did someone hijack your account between the first two paragraphs ? 
  and the shady haxor going by name / r/askeurope, 
  well , english was certainly not a native language in america either . 
  well , i did n't invent the rt reporting by myself . 
  instead i 'm referencing what they actually have reported .
