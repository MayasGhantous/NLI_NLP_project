  also , klaipeda is the very region where the strategic lng terminal is being built to enable lithuania and its neighbours to access alternatives to russian gas . 
  i can see why russia would like to have turmoil over there . 
  ^ i ^ would but then again i 'm a monster . 
  amazing final . 
  what a game . 
  well deserved and well done .

  no need to worry . 
  fta :  vote expected on sanctions  the senate foreign relations committee was expected to vote thursday afternoon on bipartisan legislation that would increase military and non-military assistance to ukraine as well as impose broad sanctions on russia 's defence , energy and financial sectors . 
  the bill passed the committee vote : [ senate foreign relations committee unanimously passes ukraine freedom support act of 2014 ] ( http://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/chair/release/senate-foreign-relations-committee-unanimously-passes-ukraine-freedom-support-act-of-2014 ) excerpts :  the legislation requires the president to apply sanctions against :  * rosoboronexport and other russian defense firms that contribute to instability in ukraine , moldova , georgia , and syria ;  * companies worldwide that make significant investments in particular unconventional russian crude oil energy projects ;  * gazprom , if the president determines that gazprom is withholding significant natural gas supplies from member countries of nato or further withholds such supplies from countries such as ukraine , georgia , or moldova . 
   it also authorizes restrictions on foreign financial institutions ' dealings with the united states banking system if it is determined the financial institution has engaged in significant sanctionable transactions related to russia 's defense and energy sectors , or significant transactions on behalf of any russian individual or entity that has been sanctioned in connection with the crisis in ukraine . 
   this legislation authorizes the president to provide military assistance to ukraine , to include : providing defense articles , defense services , and training to the government of ukraine for the purpose of countering offensive weapons and reestablishing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine , including anti-tank and anti-armor weapons ; crew weapons and ammunition ; counter-artillery radars to identify and target artillery batteries ; fire control , range finder , and optical and guidance and control equipment ; tactical troop-operated surveillance drones , and secure command and communications equipment . 
  it authorizes $ 350 million in fiscal year 2015 to carry out these activities . 
   ulyukayev renewed threats to curb ukraine 's access to vital russian markets , showing that a concession brussels made to russia on friday - to delay the pact 's implementation for 15 months - had failed to ease moscow 's concerns . 
  that much for russia 's promise not to impose any trade restrictions on ukraine during the postponement period . 
   the eu emission target ends in less than 6 years the eu already has [ the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/2030/index_en.htm ) in the works . 
   ( and even that target limit is too low compared to what is needed according to science ) so , what does the science say about our targets , according to science what should be the target for the eu and especially for finland ? 
  my common sense says that even if finland cut ghg emissions to zero right away it would not have much impact on global climate change . 
   and after 2020 there 's no legally binding international treaties or protocols to follow , for post-kyoto agreement there will be the un climate change conference in paris in 2015 . 
   and finland does not have any internal short-term goals before 2050 . 
  of course finland will have targets for 2030 , and after that next targets etc. 
   only after a firm and binding decision to decrease emissions you can start thinking about the methods finland already has adopted and ratified the relevant treaties and protocols regarding ghg emission cuts : http://www.ym.fi/fi-fi/ymparisto/ilmasto_ja_ilma/ilmastonmuutoksen_hillitseminen/kansallinen_ilmastopolitiikka, 
  2013 finland imported 4.7 twh of electricity from russia . 
  arguably in that sense having a new npp producing electricity in finland , even if it was built by rosatom , would make finland less dependend on energy imports from russia . 
  of course , there would be issue of nuclear fuel : to what extent would the npp be dependend on russian nuclear fuel without option of using other fuel suppliers if necessary . 
  and additional +12 goes to ireland . 
   the greens accepted the first plans of the nuclear plant 3 years ago but the situation has changed dramatically . 
  no , then they voted against it and the other npp license too , but remained in the governing coalition . 
  this time they left the coalition over the npp license . 
   i am myself pro nuclear power . 
  my opinion is that this should be frozen and we should find another nuclear power company . 
  there is plenty in the west . 
  also remember this initial licence is only the first step ( * periaatep\u00e4\u00e4t\u00f6s * ) . 
  it is not a building permit which will require a separate political decision in the future . 
  and a lot can happen between now and then . 
  personally i 'm skeptical of project 's chances to actually succeed . 
  the project is still lacking in its funding , and there are great uncertainties regarding russia . 
  it may very well happen that it gets frozen by possible future sanctions , or fails to gather funding in finland , or something else . 
  what i find most unfortunate here is that the tvo npp project will probably not get an extension for its timeline . 
  so , if that project gets no license , and fennovoima project fails - then there will be no new npp projects going forward . 
  if scotland votes yes what would be the implications for the eurovision voting blocks ? 
  then possible future eu sanctions could freeze the project . 
  in other news today the european parliament plenary adopted a resolution where it urges member states to cancel planned energy sector agreements with russia : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140918ipr65201/html/meps-welcome-signs-of-hope-in-ukraine-and-urge-the-eu-to-stand-up-to-russia, 
   nuclear power could be sanctioned in the next phase of sanctions . 
  even if that happened the sanctions would not retroactively affect deals already made . 
  greens leaving the government coalition should be seen as an opportunity . 
  now would be good time to pass not only one but two or even three new npp licences ( tvo , fortum ) . 
  but apparently the government is not willing to give the time extension to tvo 's licence , and i do n't know the status of fortum 's npp project . 
   thirdly even if rosatom is a major owner with around 40 % ownership . 
  the project is still [ lacking probably about 600-700 million ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/professori_uskoo_molempien_ydinvoimalahankkeiden_kaatuvan/7473885 ) of funding which has to be found from finnish ( or perhaps eu ) companies by june 2015 .

  this video rendition by an anonymous swedish guy : [ brittas fitta ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj4q02mgi_s ) nah , just joking . 
  while do like that one a bit i like even more this swedish piece of superabundant fabulousness : [ laakso - italy vs helsinki ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5opu5kfaky ), 
  ah , got it . 
   i 'm just afraid that dacia might be an exception . 
  how about \u0160koda or solaris and others ? 
   its a bit far fetched to call it a precedent , imo . 
  yes , it is . 
  but then again russia 's foreign policy has not appeared as reasonable for quite some time , and i would not find it surprising if they were to claim it as a precedent for whatever goals they might have in the future . 
  and to me the postponement until 2016 is an eu step not without possible pitfalls . 
  one might say that on the positive side russia agreed not to impose any trade restrictions on ukraine during the postponement period . 
  but then again russia has been breaking so many agreements and promises lately that one can hardly rely on that agreement either . 
  additionally russia has also plenty of room for wiggle :  he also made a separate statement that if `` the partners violate the agreement and begin to implement the trade section , '' russia will return to the issue of trade restrictions against ukraine . 
   `` we understand perfectly that in this statement the kremlin is inserting not only the matter of duty-free goods but the entire issue of reforms . 
  and as soon as we begin to implement the european technological regulations or to adapt the phytosanitary standards as part of our obligations to the association , we will immediately get an answer from the kremlin , '', 
   i guess it 's not the problem with not getting the money , but what you do with it when you get it . 
  indeed . 
  additionally some countries have problems absorbing the funding they are entitled to and use only small part of it , see : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hcxob/absorption_rate_of_eu_funds/, 
   i did n't mean cars made by ukrainian workers , i meant cars made by ukrainian companies , such as zaz . 
  well here 's just some examples of cars zaz is or has been manufacturing in ukraine : chevrolet aveo , chevrolet captiva , chevrolet epica , chevrolet evanda , chevrolet lacetti , chrysler 300 , daewoo lanos , daewoo sens , daewoo tacuma , kia cerato , kia magentis , kia mohave , kia picanto , kia rio , kia sorento , kia cee 'd , kia sportage , dacia solenza , opel astra , opel vectra , opel corsa , opel combo , mercedes-benz e-class , mercedes-benz m-class , couple of models of lada , and their own brand zaz cars . 
   it seems from this year 2004 . 
  for more recent data see : http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-funding/beneficiaries/direct-aid/index_en.htm or check the links to member state websites here : http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-funding/beneficiaries/shared/index_en.htm or try this interactive tool to see the eu budget expendidures by country : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm, 
   there 's no way ukrainian cars can compete with mercs or vws under the same rules . 
  why do you believe ukrainian made cars ( such as chevrolet , vw , huyndai , kia , \u0160koda , opel etc ) can not compete ? 
  they already do compete , and successfully one might say . 
   how are these issues addressed in the eu ? 
  just for one example the free trade deal is * asymmetrical * . 
  that means ukraine will get a tariff free access to the largest market in the world while it can keep its own tariffs for imports from that market depending on the sector - and in case of the automotive industry for up to 15 years . 
  here 's an interesting assessment : [ the `` delayed '' association agreement -- the hidden details ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/09/16/the-delayed-association-agreement-the-hidden-details/ )  a logical question arises -- what does the russian government have to do with our bilateral agreement with the eu ??? 
  let us emphasize that the appearance of russia in this format is not unexpected . 
  this is not the first round of the tripartite consultations . 
  but earlier they were followed primarily by experts . 
  now the published agreements have attracted the attention of the general public . 
   and finally , until the last minute , even the experts expected that that the tripartite documents , which formalizes russia 's influence on the aa , would not be necessary . 
  this is the biggest political problem with the brussels agreements and putin 's greatest achievement in this context . 
  in fact , the parties recognize the kremlin 's right to influence trade agreements between other independent entities . 
   there is no doubt , that putin will return again and again to this practice , insisting that an international legal precedent was established on september 12 that gives him that right . 
  it should be noted that this problem is likely to cause the greatest harm not to ukraine but to the european union . 
   just to check-up , i googled that and as the first results i got actually trilingual street signs in helsinki : sofiankatu , or sofiegatan , or \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 that 's because the street is actually an open-air museum and the street signs are part of the exhibition - as they used to be trilingual in the 19th cent . 
   number of citations, 
   i was just trying to explain to you that the gats fta and others of its ilk ( like tisa , for example ) create a one way street to radical global services `` liberalisation '' yes , i understood what you 're trying to claim . 
  but that claimed ` one way street ' has not happened here , which means your prophesies are not accurate . 
   i mean finland did n't even have vikings , what a bunch of losers . 
  indeed . 
  them pussies kicked ass all over europe except in finland . 
  so scotland * is * into nordics which have been rising since the last glaciation . 
  rising my glass for that !,
