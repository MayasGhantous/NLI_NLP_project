  and i have no doubt that depending on local culture * some forms * of fgm * may * be motivated by beliefs of controlling sexual behavior . 
  my critisism to your point has been and is that it : 1 . 
  confuses various forms of fgm 2 . 
  lacks actual evidence ( e.g. 
  confirming studies , and how do the women themselves see the issue ? ), 
  about indonesia : how do you think making an incision on clitoral hood is supposed to control women 's sexuality when it actually enhances sexual stimulation ? 
  that 's exactly the reason why some western women choose to do it , and the procedure is even used as treatment in sexual dysfunction issues . 
  well , for example in us mgm is routinely done to infants . 
  interestingly after mutilation the baby 's foreskin becomes hospital 's property , and they get to sell it for profit . 
  infant foreskins do have some applications , some more macabre than others : [ foreskin wrinkle cream ] ( http://forums.canadiancontent.net/consumer-awareness/73244-foreskin-wrinkle-cream.html )  barbara blair says this new gel she 's been using makes her face look a lot younger than the retin-a and vitamin c creams she 's been using . 
  `` it 's really tightened my skin . 
  firmed it . 
  the little lines are much better . 
  the texture is very appreciably different . '', 
  what blair probably does n't know is that a key ingredient in the cream is the foreskin of a circumcised baby . 
  the skin that would otherwise be tossed away . 
  it was first made into a product that helped burn victims heal . 
  now it 's in this antiwrinkle gel , called tns recovery complex . 
  betsy rubenstone is the aesthetician in the plastic surgery department at the university of pennsylvania and she swears by this stuff . 
  she knows why the foreskin is used . 
  `` it 's filled with everything we begin to lose as we age , '' rubenstone says . 
  `` and that includes growth factors , amino acids , proteins , collage , elastin and holyuronic acid . '', 
   from wikipedia : the practice is carried out by some communities who believe it reduces a woman 's libido -- according to official statements of the the top muslim clerical body of the largest muslim-majority nation of the world , the indonesian ulema council , `` the practice ( of fgm ) is a religious obligation that should be done to control women 's sexual desires '' . 
  since when have * opinion pieces * been acceptable sources for facts in wikipedia ? 
  it 's from an opinion piece by an american writer who does not provide direct quotes or primary sources . 
  fwiw here 's actual quotes from a prominent indonesian cleric : [ cleric : do n't cut too much female genital to avoid sexuality loss ] ( http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/26/cleric-don%e2%80%99t-cut-too-much-female-genital-avoid-sexuality-loss.html )  a nahdlatul ulama ( nu ) cleric said on friday that circumcision on women was not supposed to cause the loss of their sexuality . 
  `` do n't cut too much . 
  just cut the small skin on the tip of the clitoris . 
  otherwise , a woman would lose her sexuality , and you males do n't like that to happen , do you ? '' prominent cleric mohammad masyhuri told a press conference . 
  masyhuri , also a member of nu suriah ( lawmaking body ) , said that a proper female circumcision should not cause any damage to woman genitals . 
  `` no bleeding , if you do it properly . '' besides , i do n't undestand how making an incision on clitoral hood would be supposed to suppress sexuality anyway . 
  as it actually enhances sexual stimulation . 
   alright , let 's see what who has to say : who seems to use some weasel words there without proper quantifying ( how `` often '' ? 
  how `` many '' ? ) . 
  sloppy text for a source that presents itself authorative on the matter . 
  that kind would n't fly even in wikipedia without fellow editors demanding cited numbers . 
  and then to strengthen it 's point who refers to type iii fgm , which is one of the least prevalent types - making a baseless generalization . 
  i have no doubt that depending on local culture * some * forms of fgm may indeed be motivated by beliefs of controlling sexual behavior . 
  but that citation does not in any way demostrate that all would be or even most . 
   here 's the campaign desert flower foundation aimed at ending fgm : the problem with that citation is lumping * all * fgm into same bucket with some types of fgm . 
  and actually some forms of fgm do enhance female sexual stimulus ( e.g. 
  making a cision to clitoral hood , stretching of labia etc ) . 
  edit : here 's a study how one of the most severe forms of fgm ( including aforementioned type iii ) affects sexual stimulus among sudanese women : [ the sexual experience and marital adjustment of genitally circumcised and infibulated females in the sudan ] ( http://www.fgmnetwork.org/authors/lightfoot-klein/sexualexperience.htm )  in a study conducted over a 5-year period , the author interviewed over 300 sudanese women and 100 sudanese men on the sexual experience of circumcised and infibulated women . 
  sudanese circumcision involves excision of the clitoris , the labia minora and the inner layers of the labia majora , and fusion or infibulation of the bilateral wound . 
  * the findings of this study indicate that sexual desire , pleasure , and orgasm are experienced by the majority of women who have been subjected to this extreme sexual mutilation , in spite of their also being culturally hound to hide these experiences . 
  * these findings also seriously question the importance of the clitoris as an organ that must be stimulated in order to produce female orgasm , as is often maintained in western sexological literature . 
  and it 's also worth bearing in mind that the sudanese form of fgm is one of the most extreme and relatively rare globally . 
  yes , it 's mostly done to boys not infants . 
  apparently philippines has even tried to set a macabre world record of mutilating most genitals in a day : [ guinness world records rejects philippines ' mass ` circumcision party ' ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/10/philippines-circumcision-party_n_859969.html )  guinness world records officials distanced themselves from an event in the philippines on may 7 that claimed to set the world record for most circumcisions . 
  public health officials claimed that more than 1,500 boys underwent the free surgery in a sports stadium in the city of marikina . 
  circumcision is a rite of passage for preteen boys in the philippines . 
  but guinness officials said monday they would n't consider the so-called `` circumcision party '' for their record book . 
  fwiw : in philippines circumcision is very prevalent ( ~ 93 % ) , and not only a muslim thing as the country is predominantly catholic ( ~ 80 % ) . 
  yeah , it does sound like what an imageboard would do . 
  but the spam campaing was organized by pirate party 's rick falkvinge who set up a mass-mailing account and prewritten e-mails to send to * all * meps at once : http://falkvinge.net/2013/03/06/next-tuesday-the-european-parliament-votes-to-ban-all-your-porn-yes-really-take-immediate-action/ * i have set up a mail alias that resolves to every member of european parliament ( all some 750 of them ) ; the mail alias is [deleted]@falkvinge.net . 
  mail them right now , regardless of whether you are an eu citizen or not . 
  write a mail with just whatever you feel about this issue from a personal standpoint , maybe picking inspiration from one of these sample letters , mixing and matching them , or rolling your own entirely : * then they whine how the canned spam emails got eventually deleted . 
  lame . 
   this is actually a great opportunity to help sink this bill !, 
  it 's not a bill . 
  the vote is not about a proposed law . 
  the european parliament votes on a resolution on a report : [ report on eliminating gender stereotypes in the eu ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=report&amp;reference=a7-2012-0401&amp;language=en ) . 
  the resolution is non-binding and consists of various calls for action on the eu , commission , member states , businesses etc. 
  in the resolution there was a line which technically could be interpreted as a call for banning porn if taken out of context . 
  and as the intention was not to call for banning porn now apparently even that technicality is being resolved , and the line in question being removed : http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19ugyp/eu_parliament_voting_for_a_complete_ban_on/c8rg5bb * `` we refer mainly to publicity in the written media and television . 
  freedom to watch a porno film remains intact . 
  * * but as it is true that this is not clear in the paragraph , we have decided to ask for a split vote to delete the sentence . 
  therefore , the words '' which called for a ban on all forms of pornography in the media '' will be deleted from the report . 
  earlier discussion : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19sqnc/next_tuesday_the_european_parliament_votes_to_ban/, 
  exactly . 
  and furthermore even that technically unfortunate wording is apparently being changed , see : http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/19t1ol/european_union_to_vote_to_ban_pornography_on/c8rg223 * `` we refer mainly to publicity in the written media and television . 
  freedom to watch a porno film remains intact . 
  * * but as it is true that this is not clear in the paragraph , we have decided to ask for a split vote to delete the sentence . 
  therefore , the words '' which called for a ban on all forms of pornography in the media '' will be deleted from the report . 
  the vote is not about a law or even a proposal for a law at all . 
  it 's a vote on a resolution related to a report : [ report on eliminating gender stereotypes in the eu ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=report&amp;amp;reference=a7-2012-0401&amp;amp;language=en#title1 ) whatever the result of the vote is , it does not ban anything . 
  google the number in article 's address , click on the first link . 
  why do n't you read the actual budgets . 
  commitment appropriations in mff 2014-2020 1 . 
  smart and inclusive growth 450 763 $ mn 2 . 
  sustainable growth : natural resources 373 179 $ mn ( includes subsidies as direct payments : 277 851 $ mn ) 3 . 
  security and citizenship 15 686 $ mn 4 . 
  global europe 58 704 $ mn 5 . 
  administration 61 629 $ mn 6 . 
  compensations 27 $ mn, 
   yes , this should be the main point of view from which schengen enlargement is discussed . 
  unfortunately , i get the feeling that this is more of a pretext , and the real reason politicians from eu countries oppose our admission is to get votes from less informed people ( who just vent their frustration about roma immigrants ) . 
  not a pretext here , the actual issues are just what i said . 
  the same as in 2011 : [ netherlands , finland oppose schengen enlargement ] ( http://euobserver.com/justice/113697 ) in 2011 after further assurances of `` bilateral police co-operation '' finland dropped it 's veto : [ finland drops veto against schengen enlargement ] ( http://euobserver.com/justice/114273 )  if this really is the reason , the opposing countries should set a clear standard that romania and bulgaria have to satisfy , and commit to accepting the two countries after the standard is reached . 
  not just give vague answers on the lines of `` you 're not good enough yet , keep trying '' . 
  yes , i agree . 
  i do n't know about the discussions and co-operation between fi , ro and bg related to the issues , so it 's hard for me to say what is it exactly what is perceived to be lacking and by how much . 
  but otoh the matter is not just about technicalities or standards . 
  personally i 'd support a phased enlargement and hope that an agreement will be reached . 
  besides , i do n't particularly like our current interior minister p\u00e4ivi r\u00e4s\u00e4nen and seldomly agree with her views anyway - but it 's not relevant here . 
  honestly , i do n't remember when cap has been `` the biggest eu contribution '' - it is n't this year , it is n't in the current budget 2007-13 , and will not be in the next budget 2014-20 . 
  to claim that it is , is simply not true and to put it bluntly a lie . 
   there is absolutely no connection between schengen membership and access to social security and welfare . 
  exactly . 
   all romanian and bulgarian citizens already have the right to travel freely in the schengen space .
