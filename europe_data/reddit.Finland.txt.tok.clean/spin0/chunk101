  indeed . 
   we just have to show an id at the border . 
  right . 
   admitting us would mean that we do n't need to show the id any more . 
  and something else much more relevant here : it would mean that romania and bulgaria forms the outer border of eu . 
  not all countries are convinced that romania and bulgaria are ready to take that responsibility - reasoning being : corruption of officials , human smuggling , organized crime etc. 
   your comment reinforces my belief that we are rejected for populist reasons based on misinformation . 
  the actual concerns stated above has been on the table for years . 
  it has been discussed for years . 
  various promises has been made but apparently too little progress has actually happened . 
  and the minister is right . 
  the matter is not relevant to `` roma beggars '' in the first place , or romanians or bulgarians for that matter . 
  as eu citizens they all already have the freedom of travel within eu , and this decision does not change that . 
  the matter concerns romanian and bulgarian * borders * and their perceived inefficienciens in patrolling them - either because of corruption ( organized crime , human smuggling etc ) or lack of resources . 
   because it 's common knowledge , cap is a huge part of the eu budget . 
  you yourself said it 's 40 % , that 's massive . 
  which is not `` most '' as you claimed , and not even the biggest as you stated . 
  have n't you by now actually spend a second to consider that what you claimed is not true . 
   i read the news , there 's plenty of infographics which say the same . 
  no there is n't , even that piece you just quoted contradicts your earlier claims . 
  please do read what you claimed and adjust accordingly . 
   in the mean-time , i 'll stand by what i said . 
  ok , then i 'll just bail out right here . 
   i 've not seen it , then why on earth did you make claims about it in the first place ? 
   but in simplistic terms when you said that 40 % of the eu budget is spent on the cap i just thought that had to be the biggest expenditure . 
  well it is n't , and in fact your original claim was `` most '' . 
  in simplistic terms it 's pretty much impossible to capture reality which generally is more complex . 
   and you actually half agreed with france being the biggest benefactor so it 's probably a bit unfair to call it a disingenuous argument . 
  not just `` half agreed '' , i specifically demonstrated that france is the biggest receiver of cap in absolute numbers . 
  because it is . 
  the numbers also show that france has by far the biggest agricultural output in the eu , and in terms of cap french farmers are not `` inefficient '' compared to others ( for example uk ) . 
  i have no problem with france being the biggest receiver as their output exceeds the cap received . 
   is the cap the biggest thing that the eu budget is spent on ? 
  budget heading `` smart and inclusive growth '' is the biggest with about 47 % share of eu budget , please see the links i provided . 
  indeed cap is not what eu `` does the most '' and arguing that would be disingenuous . 
   and how much money does france receive compared to other countries ? 
  2010 in millions $ and share of cap : [ statistical factsheets - agriculture in the european union and the member states ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/perspec/background/index_en.htm#smt ) 1 . 
  france - 9 963 ( 17 % ) 2 . 
  spain - 7 175 ( 12 % ) 3 . 
  germany - 6 896 ( 12 % ) 4 . 
  italy - 6 200 ( 11 % ) 5 . 
  poland - 4 355 ( 7 % ) 6 . 
  uk - 4 052 ( 7 % ) edit : 2010 total cap expenditure was 58 146 . 
   is it still the biggest cap beneficiary ? 
  depends on how one calculates . 
  in absolute numbers yes . 
  then again france has by far the biggest agricultular output in eu : [ see this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fcp2dzh ) in other words france received about 17 % of cap and at the same time it 's output was over 18 % . 
  by those numbers your notion of `` inefficient french farmers '' seems to apply better to uk farmers - but i guess that would be splitting the hairs . 
  i 'm not particularly a friend of cap , i do recognize the reasoning behind it and support the ongoing reformations . 
  and otoh i do n't support some of the often repeated disingenuous arguments against it either . 
   you could probably argue that propping up inefficient french farmers is n't a good way to spend time and resources and yet that 's what the eu does the most . 
  the total cap is currently about 40 % of eu budget and france receives a fraction of that . 
  furthermore cap is being reduced every year both in terms of relative share and absolute numbers : [ see this chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvux068 ) additional information about eu 2014-20 budget here : http://www.consilium.europa.eu/special-reports/mff/summary-of-the-european-council-agreement and about cap and the ongoing program to reduce it here : http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm,

   looks like latvia 's public debt is over 130 % of its gdp . 
  actually latvia 's public debt is about 40.4 % of gdp and the share is decreasing ( -3.6 % in q3/2011-q 3/2012 ) . 
   i 'm not contesting that later they tightened the limits , but you apparently have no clue how referencing works . 
  apparently not . 
   so lets try something different . 
  yeah , let 's play change the onus game shall we :  please explain what [ 1 ] regulation 297/2011 does and why it references the older chernobyl regulations . 
  was not my claim , onus not on me , and i see no reason for me to provide for it . 
  you do the work . 
  but please go on , and as the proponent you please explain . 
  of course it matters . 
  as that regulation applicable to chernobyl ( not japan ) was already expired by 2010 , then op 's refencing to it is essentially misleading and irrelevant at best . 
  so : what op 's ( and your ) contention needs is an actual effective regulation for support . 
  but no show . 
  and i have already provided the regulation quite opposite to your contention . 
  as i said the limits were actually tightended after fukushima . 
  as i already referenced the chernobyl regulation expired year before fukushima . 
  if you have new references to support your contention please do provide . 
   i disagree . 
  the reason the cold war space race did n't achieve much in the long term or of long term value was because of the reasons they were racing . 
  they wanted to use space for a military advantage . 
  if the goal was some thing different and some thing less about damage and more about progress then i doubt the space program would have ( in the long term ) failed so badly . 
  if there were long term goals like ( long term ) financial gain or the collection of rare minerals then the race would ( and could ) turn out differently . 
  sure , had there been such imaginary incentives . 
  but there obviously was n't . 
  and there still has n't been such incentives for human space flight . 
  it should be quite a rare mineral for anyone to launch people to space to harvest it for profit . 
  and it might very well be more cost effective to develop new competing techonologies to supplant or supercede it with much cheaper earthly solutions . 
  atm we need no raw materials from asteroids or space which we do n't already have here on earth or could n't produce here - there 's simply no demand for space stuff . 
  could change in the future but for the rare if unit cost will be imperative . 
   i believe that is what is happening with all the private companies at the moment . 
  they 're all trying to get up to space and make a profit in a long term fashion . 
  so that they can continually see financial returns for the foreseeable future . 
  that 's one reason why i think this will work better than it did previously . 
  sure , which company would n't try and make profit . 
  for private companies the biggest profit has been in leo and geo satellite launches as these actually bring value to their customers . 
  the current hardware and the services it provides is valued at hundreds of billions . 
  there 's long term profit right there and has been for decades . 
  for decades private companies have been providing lauch services with their rockets and making profits . 
  launching satellites is a big business , and it is useful and valuable to us all . 
  easily worth billions . 
  human space flight is another business altogether . 
  there are only few humans who are able and willing to pay for a suborbital flight and even fewer who would pay for a longer stay in orbit . 
  yet there are such persons as some examples show with private soyuz launches , but it has not been big business even for roscosmos . 
  it might be a viable business model to provide suborbital human space flights for fun experience , but the very companies that for years have claimed to do it have n't actually delivered . 
  not to mention harder by magnitude orbital flights or staying on orbit with envisioned space hotels and all .
