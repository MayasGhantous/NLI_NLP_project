  who cares where it originates it 's just as misinformed . 
   edit : sorry , forgot that : [ 1 ] here 's the regulation that was in place before 25th of march . 
  the maximum levels for caesium are regulated in article 2 , 2a . 
  as you can see ... nope . 
  read it . 
  see following points . 
  1 . what is it 's name and purpose ? 
   council regulation ( ec ) no 733/2008 of 15 july 2008 on the conditions governing imports of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the chernobyl nuclear power station 2 . and when did it expire ? 
   it shall expire : ( a ) on 31 march 2010 , unless the council decides otherwise at an earlier date , in particular if the list of excluded products referred to in article 4 covers all the products fit for human consumption to which this regulation applies ; . 
   how is that not an increase ? 
  because it 's not , and the limits were actually ** tightened ** after fukushima . 
  that fact was quite widely published as most already know and even you acknowledged . 
  we know eu actually tightened the limits . 
  you could edit that relevant piece of commonly known information into your op where you claim the opposite , as it 's no joke to willingly spread misinformation ( unless trolling ) . 
   first page , point ( 3 ) : ... yeah , those articles in eu legislation do exist and that 's why they are mentioned . 
  but that 's not the actual regulation which starts from page two at the point : has adopted this regulation that 's the regulation . 
  please read it . 
  and please demonstrate where does that regulation increase radiation limits and how . 
   no urban myth there . 
  if that 's not an intrenet urban myth then let 's call it a myth based on a crappy blog post with baseless interpretations . 
  as eu actually tightened the limits . 
   the regulation was in place as early as march 25th , as you can see . 
  your articles show that the commission announced to adjust them once again two weeks later . 
  i failed to mention it because i did indeed forget about this , but it makes it even worse imho . 
  basically , they put a regulation into place in order to increase the limits first , and two weeks later they announced to tighten it for safety reasons . 
  apparently without even mentioning that they had only been increased two weeks earlier for absurd reasons , at least your two articles fail to mention this . 
  maybe because it was never increased in the first place . 
   i was n't joking , i called this practice a joke . 
  failing to mention the tightened radiation limits ? 
  i still do n't get your joke there . 
   yes , the article i posted is from march 29th . 
  it references [ 1 ] this regulation from march 25th . 
  please demonstrate where does that regulation increase radiation limits and how . 
   two weeks later , the limits were changed again because the japanese limits were stricter , that 's what your articles are about . 
  no contradiction there , euobserver even mentions the earlier regulation . 
  there is a contradiction : contrary to your claim the radiation limits were actually tightened as we all know . 
  perhaps you were unaware of it or for some other reason failed to mention it , but it is a contradiction of substance , do n't you agree ? 
   quite a joke to raise them first and then widely announce to tighten them , if you ask me . 
  at this point i honestly do n't get your joke . 
  is the joke that you failed to mention the tightened limits ? 
  as you say they were quite widely announced . 
  what a lovely and entertaining internet urban legend that is , but actually the opposite happened : [ eu plans tougher radiation limits for japanese food ] ( http://euobserver.com/news/32129 ) ( april 6 . 
  2011 ) [ eu tightens radiation limits on japan food imports ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/japan-disaster.9hs ) ( april 8 . 
  2011 ) ** tightens **, 
   austerity was such a plan but it does n't seem to be working as intended . 
  the cuts to public spending have been necessary because in the end ** nobody ** was ready to pay for that spending - not greeks , not foreigners . 
  and indeed the recent cuts have worked as greece 's public spending , deficit and interest rates have come down from previous unsustainable levels . 
  the cuts ( or `` austerity '' ) were never intented to produce growth per se in the first place - they were the needed measures to prevent a total disaster of uncontrolled default . 
  for fostering growth there are other needed measures , which greece has been a bit slow to implement : * the structural reformations * . 
  that 's the plan meant to promote growth , not `` austerity '' which was an inevitable neccessity after unsustainable overspending . 
   in particular , belgium , finland , greece , ireland , italy , luxembourg , portugal , slovenia and spain have negative to no progress at all to show for the past 5 years . 
  concerning finland the graph above shows the reason ( it 's not euro ) . 
  2009 was a very bad year indeed , but you also see the very rapid bounce back to strong growth right after it . 
  the 2009 anomaly has to do with global recession , our dependence of exports and some other stuff ( euro not big factor there ) . 
  but now the financial crisis in eurozone is dragging us down too . 
  so to put it blunty now we have to do some austerity over here to support failing south and to still stay competitive in the process . 
  not fun i can tell you , but they have it worse over there i hear . 
  for added irony : see finland 's debt and deficit graph above . 
  then compare with ... 
  it does sound like monty python , but it 's more complicated than that . 
  different aflatoxins are produced by aspergillus mold and there is no known practical solution to totally prevent them from all food products . 
  they do appear in various concentrations in cereals , oilseeds , spices , nuts , maize , dried fruit , figs etc. 
  aflatoxin m appears in diary products when cows eat food contaminated with aspergillus . 
  in eu the limit for aflatoxin m1 is 0.050 \u00b5g / kg in milk and milk products , and more specifically 0.10 \u00b5g / kg for b1 and 0.025 \u00b5g / kg for m1 in infant foods . 
  besides different types of aflatoxins sampling and analytical methods are also important here , and i do n't know if they 're different in serbia . 
  obviously it 's not a good solution to simply change the limit , but it 's not too horrible either as it 's still very small amounts we 're talking about . 
  the real long-term solution would be to find out what is causing it : * where * and * why * some cows eat food contaminated with aspergillus , and * how * to change agricultural practices to prevent it . 
  i hope your gov or someone else investigates it . 
   i should have added ` successful ' then you would not have qualified . 
  cool . 
   so you support the parties that made the mess ? 
  as non-italian i do n't vote or support italian parties . 
  the mess is yours , but unfortunately also others will probably have to pay for it . 
  yet i think that forming a government would be a sensible first step towards untangling the mess . 
  edit : not that he has n't good ideas in his idealism , imo he does and i can relate to his supporters . 
  but atm it 's the implementation that 's lacking , and frankly the idea not to form a government but let it fall just because that has potential future benefits * for the party * sounds just as selfish cold blooded calculation as ever : * `` the right and the left will get together and will govern a country of rubble that they are responsible for . 
  it will last a year . 
  one . 
  maximum . 
  then there will be elections again . 
  and once again the five star movement will change the world . 
  in so many ways you 're looking good , poland !,

  interesting but potentially expensive drama at least from finnish point of view . 
   greece is the poster child for austerity ... 
  i do n't hold greece as a poster boy for austerity because greece has been forced to cut spending in order to get it 's severe deficit and interest rates under control . 
  it has not been done to cause growth , and nobody expects it alone to produce growth ( not greece , not imf , not emu ) . 
  what is expected to bring growth are the necessary * structural reforms * , e.g. 
  : * income tax reform * bridging the competitiveness gap * productivity growth * liberalizing product and service markets * opening sectors to competition ( like retail sector only some months ago ) * opening overly regulated professions ( over 500 in greece and account for about one-third of employment ) * privatization * etc greece has done a lot but slowly and there 's still far more to do . 
  here 's a good summary : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/int011813a.htm  greece : snapshot of reform results \u2022 a reinforced financial system . 
  deposits have been returning to the banking system since mid-2012 . 
  core banks have been recapitalized , and their balance sheets significantly strengthened . 
  greek banks now have little exposure to the greek state .
