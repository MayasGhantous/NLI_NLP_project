  \u2022 a more competitive labor market . 
  unit labor costs have dropped by 15 percent since their pre-crisis peak . 
  the minimum wage has been reduced by over 20 percent , the system for setting the minimum wage has been reformed ( with the influence of insiders reduced dramatically ) , severance costs have been cut back , and onerous pre-approval requirements for work schedules and overtime have been eliminated . 
  \u2022 a more affordable pension system . 
  reforms will reduce pension spending from 17 percent in 2012 to about 14 percent of gdp in 2013 , closer to the euro area average of 12 percent of gdp . 
  pensions below $ 1000 per month have been left untouched , to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected . 
  \u2022 more affordable prices and more consumer choice . 
  prices in greece have now begun to fall . 
  while progress has been too limited when it comes to instilling competition into important sectors of the economy , there have been some recent successes which point to further gains ahead . 
  the retail sector in greece was liberalized in late 2012 . 
  the sector has been characterized by high prices -- especially for food -- with productivity lagging the eu-15 average by 30-40 percent .

   does n't a rebound just means a number is better than it was previously ? 
  well if that were the measure then greece 's economy had `` rebounded '' already in 2012 : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/neyj0mo ) anyway , bank of greece governor provopoulos did n't say it 's `` on the rebound '' . 
  he said it 's in a `` clearly improving situation '' . 
  and it is . 
   when i have time i 'd love to compile a graph of growth in the years on the run-up to the euro for each nation vs the years since - it 's something i 'd be very interested to see . 
  here 's finland for starters ( [ source with data ] ( http://www.findikaattori.fi/en/2 ) ) . 
  which was ? 
  that , and to be fair : according to other reports bank of greece governor provopoulos did n't say that . 
  i think it 's probably editorialized by menafn and then a bit more by op . 
  here 's better reports of his speech : http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bank-greece-output-down-201-percent http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/02/25/greek-bank-leader-says-crisis-ending/ he said that greece 's economy is in `` clearly improving '' situation ( which it is ) . 
  * `` the danger of ( financial ) collapse has been overcome and exit from the euro made more remote , while trust is steadily being regained '' * * `` there is no doubt that 2013 will be a difficult year , chiefly because of the continuing recession and high unemployment '' * * `` important developments have created a clearly improving situation for the state of the economy ... but there is no room for complacency '' * * `` the continued implementation of greece 's program is a precondition for the country 's recovery . 
  '' * etc. 
   so non-eu-members were n't asked ? 
  because i feel european as fuck . 
  yes , but the question was actually about eu * citizenship * , which would be a pointless question to ask a person who is not . 
  generally [ eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb_arch_en.htm ) is done in member and sometimes canditate states , and therefore some countries get unfortunately excluded .

  honest question : is it this `` toxic alliance '' where the notion of [ `` eurabia '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurabia ) with the related conspiracy theories originate ? 
  probably going to happen here in finland : [ finnish firm asks to donate mislabeled horsemeat products ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130222/finnish-firm-asks-donate-mislabeled-horsemeat-products ) they already got green light from the government food safety agency evira , but still need further authorization from local authorities ( which seems likely , but you never know with the bureaucrats ... ), 
   since when has the uk been the second largest contributor ? 
  well it is if you cherry pick year 2007 for the comparison . 
  ah , it 's from 2007 . 
  for more recent data see this table here : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/wel/images/financialreport/en/annex3_1_en.png according to the table uk 's net contribution in 2011 was about $ 5.57 bn , or about 0.32 % of gni and about 0.8 % of uk public spending . 
  uk was fourth largest net contributor after germany ( 9 bn ) , france ( 6.4 bn ) and italy ( 5.9 bn ) . 
  per capita uk 's net contribution was $ 89 per citizen which is 11th highest among the 11 net contributors . 
   conservative party chairman grant shapps said he was `` delighted '' to welcome her to his party . 
  `` she brings a wealth of experience - and a dedication to fight for what 's best for the british people in europe , '' he said . 
  that 's an interesting view of the role of the european parliament . 
  edit : ep should not be a battle ground to fight for petty national interests , and it 's interesting that a party chairman implies so . 
  source , please ? 
  is this just some chosen single year or a multi-year average ? 
  well , for me the obvious is [ sibelius - finlandia op . 
  26 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosat6u4e-8 ) , and also his [ karelia suite ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syoj4fhmlc0 ) . 
  but a song that really brings a patriotic tear into my eye is ** [ oi , kallis suomenmaa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96io-jzi9y8 ) ** ( trad . 
  18th cent . ), 
  ( here with [ translated lyrics ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgt8zrlyy2o ) but crappy sound ) i also like some of the ( perhaps overtly ) patriotic military marches , not because of kickass nationalism but because of their history . 
  knowing the relevant history i can relate to those guys in those times and feel like a copatriot with them , and the marches also show how our history entwines with the larger history of europe . 
  * [ march of the finnish cavalry during the thirty years war ( 1618 - 1648 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yskw4sju4 ) or hakkapeliittain marssi/march of hakkapeliittas . 
  those days finland was part of sweden , and i like how swedish and finnish cavalries still share this battle march as part of our common military history . 
  was a horrible war that , [ hakkaa p\u00e4\u00e4lle !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) * [ suomen kaartin paluumarssi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gztgznljqw4 ) / finnish guard 's return march ( from the russo-turkish war 1878 ) . 
  then finland was autonomous part of russian empire . 
  finns were with romanians and bulgarians fighting against ottomans for romanian and bulgarian independence , and one especially memorable victory was [ battle of gorni dubnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_gorni_dubnik ) . 
  i can imagine them marching back home to finland singing this , got ta love the lyrics : * `` long we have suffered cold and hunger , fighting in the balkan mountains ... '' * * [ sibelius : j\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rimarssi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7b8e2lgly4 ) / j\u00e4ger march ( 1917 ) written and composed in defiance of the russian rule . 
  finnish volunteers ( j\u00e4gers ) were in germany in clandestine military training and preparing to fight the russians . 
  shortly thereafter finland became independend ( and had a horrible civil war ) . 
  * [ muistoja pohjolasta ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3qmtghriw ) / memories from the north ( 1917 ) j\u00e4gers .

  the article is about ** planned ** secret ballot : * `` schulz , speaking at a late-night news conference , confirmed daul 's earlier statement that the use of the special procedure was planned . 
  '' * it 's a bad plan , and has not been decided yet . 
  and as the article states at least one group opposes the idea of secret ballots ( european conservatives and reformists , ecr ) : [ meps should have courage of their convictions on eu budget and not hide behind a secret ballot ] ( http://ecrgroup.eu/?p=8137 ) what i 'd like to know is what stances do other ep groups have on this ? 
  it 's not eu regulation at all , it 's greece 's own legislation that defines the number , availability and price of taxi licenses . 
   west virginia is the poorest state in the country and it is 97 % white . 
  it does n't have a high murder rate . 
  it does n't have big cities either . 
  biggest city is charleston with a population of only 51,400 ( and metropolitan just 304,214 ) . 
  whole west virginia has a population of only 1,855,413 , and all in all it has pretty low population density . 
  i think it 's an oversimplification to make comparisons using a black-white axis only . 
  there are many parameters at play ( e.g. 
  economy , income differences , pop . 
  density , pop . 
  age , legislation and law enforcement , etc ) , and concentrating on a single one will easily give you false and misleading interpretations . 
   here the cap gets 42,5 % , down from 44 % . 
  not much of a change , really . 
  that 42.5 % does not sound correct to me . 
  [ from your link ( under issues ) ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/priorities/eu-budget-2014-2020-euro-deal-linksdossier-514729 ) : * `` under the commission proposal , the cap 's share of the eu budget would drop from almost 40 % to around 33 % by 2020 , approximately the same as regional policy . 
  '' * but to be fair : in van rompuy 's proposal cap was just a bit smaller in absolute numbers . 
  it got increased by only about $ 1 bn in the negotiations . 
  when the total sum of the budget was cut , the relative share of cap increased in percentage compared to proposal . 
  yet cap is still smaller than in previous budget 2007-13 , and gets smaller every year through 2014-20 . 
   i liked his proposal more ... . :-) me too . 
  i was expecting and even hoping for some cuts to the total sum , but not that much cuts into growth policies . 
  but as a compromise it 's not that bad . 
  still : i do hope the european parliament votes it down . 
  now that would be interesting . 
   with how much ? 
  was cut by about 11-18 % . 
  see this table : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4o1kttt.png )  it could have been cut a lot more . 
  yeah , it could have . 
  it was cut more in van rompuy 's proposal , but then got increased in the european council . 
  to me it appears they were blindly going for the austerity thingies in the negotiations , and forgot to concentrate on the need for a structural reform . 
  rompuy 's proposal was sane . 
  but now after the negotiations the result has added irrationality where : austerity = cut funding from growth programs , add funding to farm subsidies . 
  compared to the proposal the result is not good , but not that bad as a compromise .
