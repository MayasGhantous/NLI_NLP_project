  do cheaper research . 
  look for other funding . 
  go somewhere else . 
  both cap and cohesion funds were reduced compared to previous budget period . 
  and in the proposed budget cap is being reduced every year 2014-20 , see here : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvux068 ) yet van rompuy 's proposal was much better as cap was even smaller in it . 
  so when european council did their austerity thing on van rompuy 's proposal they made big cuts to programs that are supposed to promote competitiveness and growth in the long run : europe 2020 , horizon 2020 , connecting europe facility - i.e. 
  research , technology , innovation and critical infrastructure . 
  and then they added funding to cap . 
  * `` how do i austerity '' * : take a sane proposal for budget , cut funding from growth policies , add funding to farm subsidies . 
  go home and claim victory . 
   have some gold ... ooh , shiny !, 
  thank you !, 
   if finland is for eu integration , why did they not want schengen area countries in ? 
  is it that they were voting in line with their northern bloc or was it that finland is principled and did not believe that these schengen area countries were as democratic and transparent as they needed to be ? 
  finland had concerns about shortcomings in anti-corruption measures and in the fight against organised crime : [ netherlands , finland oppose schengen enlargement ] ( http://euobserver.com/justice/113697 ) later after further assurances finland dropped it 's veto : [ finland drops veto against schengen enlargement ] ( http://euobserver.com/justice/114273 ), 
   we have finland finland here . 
  i 'll provide some points and opinions , others may disagree . 
  you can quite easily model finland just by voting with others , and generally not opting out of much anything , and not threatening with a veto . 
  finland rarely raises a stink in eu negotiations or decisions . 
  one rare example happened in 2012 when finland demanded a collateral for loan garantees for greece etc. 
  and eventually got those ( well , sort of ) . 
  generally ( but not always ) finland is with the so called `` northern block '' . 
  it 's an unofficial term to describe countries in contrast of `` southern block '' , and covers usually countries like germany , netherlands , austria , sweden , denmark , uk etc. 
  finland is also a nordic country . 
  usually you can seek potential block-allies among those two groups . 
  remember : you 're a small country , you will need block-allies in various issues . 
  be ready to compromise in negotiations . 
  choose one or max two vital issues which you need to keep , and then some others where you 're willing to compromise . 
  always actively seek partners and block-allies : i 'll support your issue if you support mine , i 'll compromise here if you compromise there . 
  and when in doubt , go with germany  some finnish issues and stances : neutrality . 
  like ireland , sweden and austria finland wants to keep it 's neutrality or at least appearance of it . 
  so no nato membership , western european union ( obsolete ) membership or [ common eu defence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_security_and_defence_policy ) for finland . 
  though at the same time finland actually is a nato partner in peace and in [ nato response force ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_response_force ) , and a member of [ european union battlegroups ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=european_union_battlegroups&amp;amp;redirect=no ) . 
  but finland wants to be neutral . 
  it 's all a bit confusing , see the chart here : [ file : european defence integration.svg ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/european_defence_integration.svg ) advice : in negotiations co-operate with ireland , sweden and austria and try to form blocks with them . 
  you might need to opt out from some defence policies , but be very careful not to be left out of everything - despite being neutral you do not want to be left alone ( consult a map ) . 
  so use the leverage of the block to propose and negotiate optional ( more neutral in appearance ) ways of doing defence partnerships . 
  democracy and transparency . 
  as a nordic country finland advocates democracy , transparency and openness in government and decision making . 
  sometimes this is in contrast to some other members . 
  sweden and denmark are always good potential allies here , but not by all means the only ones . 
  farming and regional funding . 
  as a northern country finland has it 's peculiarities with agriculture . 
  farming in finland is hard compared to southern countries , yet there are quite a few farmers in finland . 
  in membership negotiations finland got a reasonable deal : finland receives funding from common agriculture policy ( cap ) and also regional development funding for eastern and northern finland from cohesion funds . 
  those two are very important , getting smaller , and they are yours * alone * to defend . 
  operative word being alone . 
  so whatever you do never put these on line in negotiations and be ready to compromise everywhere else . 
  ( for example : unlike denmark and sweden in recent budget negotiations finland did not go for a rebate because it had to defend those two . 
  as a result finland 's net contribution increased , but those two were reduced only slightly . ), 
  eu integration . 
  finland supports further integration . 
  finland is a member of emu and has $ . 
  lotsa complex interesting issues there with the bailouts , fiscal union , [ european stability mechanism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism ) and all . 
  an example of finnish stance : [ eurozone fiscal union first , more bailout funds later , finland says ] ( http://news.monstersandcritics.com/business/news/article_1687735.php/eurozone-fiscal-union-first-more-bailout-funds-later-finland-says ) popular support . 
  in finland both eu and $ have majority popular support . 
  only one party perussuomalaiset ( `` true finns '' ) has vocal anti-eu stance . 
  they 're in opposition . 
  some notable things that finland has opposed in the past . 
  2011 finland and netherlands opposed romania and bulgaria joining [ the schengen area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area#prospective_members ) . 
  unsourced and iirc : over a decade ago finland at first opposed eurozone membership of greece , because numbers did look kinda funny , but my memory may fail me here . 
  some useful links : http://valtioneuvosto.fi/eu/suomi-ja-eu/eu-linjaukset/en.jsp http://web.eduskunta.fi/resource.phx/parliament/aboutparliament/eu-affairs/index.htx [ alexander stubb ] ( http://alexstubb.com/en/ ) is finland 's minister for european affairs and foreign trade . 
  so just drop him a line and ask him if you have specific questions . 
   ... or italy dropping out of the eu ... no such thing . 
  some blogists and journalists love to speculate about various * exits ( . . grexit , fixit ... etc ) . 
  they are as accurate as mayan prophesies . 
   the one that 's jumped from 13m to 15 thousand m ? 
  that 's an error of magnitudes in the article : the 13m should be 13 thousand m . it has actually increased from about 12.2 bn ( in 2004 prices ) to about 15.7 bn ( in 2011 prices ) . 
  see [ financial framework 2007 - 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/fin_fwk0713/fwk0713_en.cfm#cf07_13 ) . 
  it 's called `` headi ng 3 - security an d citize nship '' in the [ summary of the european council agreement ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/special-reports/mff/summary-of-the-european-council-agreement ) and in the [ conclusions of the european council ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/135344.pdf ) :  93 . actions under this heading constitute a diversified range of programmes targeted to security and citizens where cooperation at union level offers value added . 
  this includes in particular actions in relation to asylum and migration and initiatives in the areas of external borders and internal security as well as measures in the field of justice . 
  particular emphasis will be given to insular societies who face disproportional migration challenges . 
  actions within this heading also support efforts to promote citizen participation in the european union , including through culture , linguistic diversity and the creative sector . 
  furthermore , it covers measures to enhance public health and consumer protection . 
  simplification of programmes will ensure a more efficient and effective future implementation of actions in this area . 
  the level of commitments for this heading will not exceed eur 15 686 million, 
   is there some sort of locked in , slow process of reduction ? 
  i 'm not that familiar with the cap , but afaik there is - [ the common agricultural policy after 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm ) . 
  or there 's at least plans , i do n't know if they 're locked in or how they work . 
  but in the budget 2014-20 one can see how cap and it 's direct payments get less funding every year : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvux068.png ), 
  yes , but that 's just the [ connecting europe facility ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility ) with a commitment of about $ 30 bn . 
  under that heading there 's lot of other stuff too related to eu 's growth strategy europe 2020 , research programme horizon 2020 , erasmus etc. 
   what 's the `` europe 2020 commitment '' ? 
  it 's related to eu 's growth strategy [ europe 2020 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm ) . 
  but it 's a bit of a mislabel there , in the council 's breakdown it 's called * `` subheading 1a -- competitiveness , jobs and growth '' * . 
  under the subheading 1a there 's commitments for : * eu research and innovation programme [ horizon 2020 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/index_en.cfm?pg=h2020 ) , got probably about $ 70 bn ( was 80bn in van rompuy 's proposal ) * new facility for energy , transport and digital infrastructure [ connecting europe facility ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility ) , got $ 30 bn ( was 50bn in proposal ) * erasmus for all ( yay !, 
  funding increased , i think by 31 % ? 
  * satnav system galileo , $ 6.3 bn * experimental fusion reactor iter , $ 2.7 bn * the european earth observation programme [ copernicus/gmes ] ( http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=252993 ) , $ 3.8 bn * for decomissioning three old ( sovjet-era ) npp 's , $ 0.86 bn and some other stuff of which i do n't know about .

  man , that cecelia gimenez is fast . 
   the only form of radioactivity that may be released by a coal plant is in the fly ash . 
  all radioactive nucleus do n't stay in the fly ash . 
  some of the radioactive elements enter gas phase during burn and are released with the stack emission ( e.g. 
  and some less volatile elements may escape as very fine particles - which amount depends on process and power plant ( ca 0.5-1 % of fly ash ) . 
  nevertheless , the amount of radioactivity released is very small and not a reason for alarm .
