  but we have no need their for their excess corn ... after buying it to their loss , let 's ship it to guatemala to ease the hunger caused by us corn policies : [ as biofuel demand grows , so do guatemala 's hunger pangs ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feel-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html?ref=world&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp; ), 
  well , it 's not that good of an article and maybe you should not base your opinion on that alone . 
  incidentally this same article was submitted few hours earlier and i posted some relevant commentary there : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/181zje/europes_plan_for_gps_limps_to_crossroads/, 
   that was a very interesting link . 
  there 's so much to esa that i really ca n't convey it in a single post , they do so much cutting egde work and top notch research ( ever heard of eso ? 
  they 're cool too ) . 
  just for some notable examples hubble is a joint nasa&esa project , and so is cassini-huygens ( with other agencies ) . 
  if you 're interested start here : www.esa.int  i was unaware that canada contributed anything into the esa . 
  canada is an associate member of esa since 1979 . 
  csa 's contribution is very much appreciated and is beneficial for both its space industry and esa . 
  from [ relevant wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_european_space_agency ) :  despite that the provisions in the esa convention do not show restrictions that only european states can join , [ 1 ] the esa council implements such rule de facto and that is why canada has only the status of associate member . 
  [ 3 ] however , it is as tightly integrated with the esa institutions as possible for a non-member state . 
  australia used to be an associate member but decided to continue only in [ european launcher development organisation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_launcher_development_organisation ) . 
  esa 's future enlargement plan includes turkey , ukraine and israel , which aspire for a membership . 
   i was also curious as to what `` human spaceflight '' represented since the esa lacks the ability to put people into space on its own . 
  i assume that is money allocated to paying the russians for rides into space ? 
  ** 1 . iss ** international space station is a joint project between nasa , roscosmos , jaxa , esa , and csa . 
  esa has contributed about 8 % of iss budged , and produced segments columbus lab , harmony , tranquility , the cupola , and will provide the european robotic arm to the station . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/tracy_caldwell_dyson_in_cupola_iss.jpg/800px-tracy_caldwell_dyson_in_cupola_iss.jpg esa developed the spacecraft atv for resupplying the station and is providing resupply launches ( jules verne , johannes kepler , edouardo amaldi , albert einstein , georges lema\u00eetre ) . 
  esa has astronaut training programme and provides astronauts to iss . 
  launch service is bought from roscosmos ( baikonur ) . 
  there has been some plans to develop esa 's own human launch capabilities , but it would be costly ( i do n't support ) . 
  ** 2 . future co-operation with nasa ( and other agencies ) ** esa is in partnership with nasa to develop future manned spaceflight beyond cis-lunar space . 
  just for one example esa will [ develop the service module for nasa 's orion spacecraft ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/human_spaceflight/research/esa_workhorse_to_power_nasa_s_orion_spacecraft ) . 
  future manned flights beyond cis-lunar space ( moon , asteroids , elusive mars ) are planned in co-operation with nasa , esa , jaxa and other space agencies . 
  anyway . 
  i 'm not that big of a fan of human space flight . 
  i wish they allocated that money to science . 
   it sounds like this was a project that was conceived with lofty goals in mind , and has now lost its focus , and sense of purpose . 
  well , that article may make it sound like that but it has n't . 
   i obviously do n't know much about this issue , but it looks like it has devolved into primarily a prestige project . 
  if your only information is that article , then your assessment about the level of knowledge would be correct . 
  the article is not informative , and refers more to ( even irrelevant ) opinions than facts , some things even incorrectly . 
   a very expensive one at that . 
  true , galileo is and will be expensive . 
  of esa 's 4284 m $ budged navigation takes 16.6 % ( 709 m $ ) , which is more than launchers or scientific programme , [ see breakdown here ] ( http://www.esa.int/for_media/latest_web_news/budget_as_presented_during_dg_press_conference_24_january_2013 ) . 
  but i 'm glad that earth observation is still the biggest part with its 22.9 % ( 983 m $ ) . 
  hopefully after the completion of galileo 's iov-ioc phases its share of esa budged would be smaller . 
  * `` hurry , hurry , hurry . 
  the greatest show on earth !, 
  * * for tonight only , see the daring attempt of a decision when parliament tries to vote on cap reduction . 
  can they survive the attempt ? 
  * * not for the faint of heart , children admitted with adult supervision . 
  or why not pack the whole thing into a trailer caravan and have it travel all around europe ? 
  it would be like a circus coming to town . 
  not a very good article : somehow misses to mention esa which is an important player here , presents lotsa opinions without facts and and gets some details wrong . 
  but true that among other problems and delays galileo has suffered from poor management , conflicting national interests ( between some eu countries , and us < -  eu ) , and has exceeded it 's projected budged many times . 
  galileo is not only eu project , though majority of funding indeed is from eu the project also includes non-eu countries : norway , morocco , ukraine , south korea and israel . 
  china used to be a partner until 2007 , but later china has been concentrating on its own system compass ( beidou ) - do n't know the actual reasons for dropping the parthership , though it was one of the reasons for us threats to shoot down galileo satellites ( [ us could shoot down euro gps satellites if used by china in wartime : report ] ( http://www.spacedaily.com/news/milspace-04zc.html ) ) . 
  galileo will provide many services which exceed current gps and egnos ( european system to augment gps ) : * free access navigation with 1m accuracy even on high latitudes * encrypted commercially accessible precision navigation to cm accuracy * encrypted government accessible precision navigation ( prs ) * guaranteed precision with integrity warning messages ( safety-of-life applications ) * global search and rescue operation with feedback to the user even though private investement has not been what was originally planned , those services will be valuable and provide for many valuable applications on long term . 
  though arguable if they are worth the high price tag of the system and its running costs . 
   the united states also initially opposed galileo , with officials in the administration of president george w. bush worrying that the european system would interfere with gps channels used by the military and could be used by america 's foes in a war . 
  afaik us opposition started during bush era after 9/11 and war on terrorism . 
  galileo 's prs channels were to be on the same spectrum as us was planning their new military m-code signals to be . 
  and their actual worry was that on a time of crisis us could not jam galileo prs without pontentially interfering its own gps military channels too . 
  the dispute has been settled and galileo 's prs channels were moved to different spectrum . 
  now galileo 's prs and gps m-channels are possible to jam independently without interfering other . 
  the report is [ ref :372 , wave : eb75 .4 , climate change ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb_special_379_360_en.htm ) . 
  and the question was :  qd1a . 
  which of the following do you consider to be the single most serious problem facing the world as a whole ? 
  some more political cartoon maps from europe : * [ 1791-1900 ] ( http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.fi/2009/06/satirical-maps.html ) * [ 1870 ] ( http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/227-first-the-cartoon-then-the-war-europe-in-1870 ) * [ wwi ] ( http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.fi/2008/08/dogs-of-war.html ) they 're fun to look at knowing what went on . 
   since i find halal slaughter to be a barbaric custom that wo n't be happening any time soon . 
  at least here in finland a halal slaughter is just the same as a normal slaughter : animal is stunned , throat cut . 
  relevant difference being that a the slaughterman says his thing before the act of slaughtering . 
  i 've been to halal slaughter 's here , and in fact they seem more humane to me , because the slaughterman actually calms the animals before his deed , which is more or less absent in industrial slaughter . 
  indeed . 
  pkn has toured in finland , norway , germany , uk , us etc , and performed with other notable punk bands . 
  just couple of months ago they did a uk tour with the hard skin , and had an earlier tour with zombie crash . 
  consequence of sound has a pretty interesting interview with them : [ this punk band does n't let down syndrome stand in their way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aznp8shd-e ), 
  i provided the link as an example of brigading because that was the example what was asked for :  / r/europe got brigaded today and yesterday ...  example for the lazy ?

  constantinople . 
  i loled the most at this part :  under the protection of our crushing artillery , brave young falcons of the serbian guard who had been streaming in from sarajevo 's serbian dominated suburbs such as ilija\u0161 and vogo\u0161\u0107a then set themselves on the heroic task of attempting to liberate the city !, 
  cool story , bro . 
  and what a punchline !, 
  10/10 would lol again . 
   narrowing / r/europe 's target audience and stopping people from commenting would be counter-productive . 
  what he is suggesting only means one can not create a new sock-puppet account and then immediately proceed to post or comment with it . 
  in some large subs it is a rule that an account must be x time old before posting or commenting . 
  see : [ why do some subreddits require certain account age to comment/post and how do they uphold this rule ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/2w99yg/why_do_some_subreddits_require_certain_account/ ), 
   not hating russia is considered shilling ? 
  no , shilling is considered shilling . 
  read the op . 
  because having a flair means the user is the whole country, 
  also this : [ yle kioski traces the origins of russian social media propaganda -- never-before-seen material from the troll factory ] ( http://kioski.yle.fi/omat/at-the-origins-of-russian-propaganda ), 
   the propaganda was n't quite so blatant to me it was always blatant . 
  their spin was always anti-west with very little critical eye on russia and they often used ` experts ' with questionable credencials to support their spin . 
  even the tinfoil hat level conspiratard stuff they produce is the same as before . 
  what is different , i think , is that only after crimea many started paying attention to it . 
  before crimea some probably still had their love affair with the rt going on because of snowden or occupy , and failed to see how one-sided their reporting actually was until crimea . 
  for that comment i hereby nominate , constitute and appoint you as a honorary finn . 
  and sibelius also composed music for poems in * [ the kanteletar ] ( http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160079&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ) * , which is sort of a sister to the kalevala : a mixed collection of folk songs and poems about various subject matters that did n't make it into the kalevala epic . 
  here 's some pieces by sibelius .
