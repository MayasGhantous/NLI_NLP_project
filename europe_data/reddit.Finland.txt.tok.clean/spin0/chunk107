  * let my love roar !, 
  well , it is not rare at all not to remember much about vappu . 
   and her facts are at times completely wrong . 
  it is actually mark adomanis who has gotten thing or two wrong . 
  [ masha gessen 's piece is well sourced as it is a book review ] ( http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/sep/02/dying-russians/ ) of two academic books about russian demographics : [ dying unneeded - the cultural context of the russian mortality crisis ] ( http://www.vanderbilt.edu/university-press/book/9780826519733 ) by sociocultural anthropologist michelle a. parsons [ russia 's peacetime demographic crisis : dimensions , causes , implications ] ( http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=446 ) by political economist nicholas eberstadt to verify what gessen has written one only needs to read the books she is writing about to see if that actually is what those academic books are saying . 
  but for some reason mark adomanis seems to believe those are claims and even factual errors by gessen herself , when in reality she is merely reporting what is presented in those two books . 
  not at any point does adomanis even acknowledge that what he is actually arguing against is two academic books by experts on the subject of russian demographics but chooses to pretend all has been invented by gessen . 
  and not only that but adomanis seems to also completely miss the point when discussing the points reported in the article , and even worse uses cherry picked statistics while at it . 
  this comment puts it well :  masha gessen may well have made some errors in her article , and mr adomanis may well be right . 
  but that 's difficult to know , as he disappointingly resorts to distortion , obfuscation , and sleight of hand to make his points . 
  let 's unpack ( not `` unpackage '' ) them one at a time :  -- when gessen wrote that russia 's fertility rate `` still has not recovered '' , she is referring to the gorbachev-era peak of 2.2 , from which it has . 
  indeed still not recovered . 
   -- gessen did not write that the us fertility rate for 2013 was 2.01 ; she stated that this is the estimated rate for 2014 . 
   -- whether russia 's birth rate is `` not that strange '' is an interpretation ; the fact is that it 's in the bottom quintile . 
   -- regarding the crude death rate , adomanis ' chart `` inexcusably '' omits data for the vast majority of the time period under discussion -- unless he thinks that khrushchev was in office in 1990 . 
  to counter the assertion of an `` inexorable rise '' in death rates , he would need to provide a chart with data going back to at least 1960 . 
  the cherry-picking is unhelpful at best , dishonest at worst . 
   -- regarding deaths from external causes , adomanis is complaining that his oranges do n't look like gessen 's apples . 
  gessen 's supporting quote is clear : eberstadt is saying that deaths from external causes in russia are getting worse * in comparison to cvd mortality levels in western europe * . 
  in other words , while russian cvd mortality is currently declining gently , europe 's has plummeted . 
  so russia may be slightly worse off in absolute terms but is much , much worse off in relative terms . 
   -- recent life expectancy data is always speculative , so in the end the dramatic rise in life expectancy in the past five years may not hold . 
  that part of the graph is far from an `` objective '' fact . 
  in any case , gessen is referring to two historical periods ( khrushchev and gorbachev ) . 
  indeed , she does n't take anything after 2000 into account -- but that has no bearing on her * historical * point . 
   whether these errors and distortions on adomanis ' part are intentional or simply a lack of time or reading comprehension , they do not inspire confidence . 
  gessen 's article deserves a thorough and thoughtful analysis and perhaps refutation ; this , sadly , is not that . 
  excellent list of good reads . 
   all of the above are cream of the crop but if you had to choose just one , read red notice , it 's absolutely mind-blowing . 
  seconded . 
  the book 's author bill browder just recently did an ama about the russian way of conducting business : http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/2vcel6/i_am_bill_browder_i_used_to_be_russias_largest/ browder used to be the largest foreign investor in russia , and his lawyer [ sergei magnitsky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergei_magnitsky ) was famously murdered in police custody after uncovering russian government corruption .

  years ago i heard from a friend of mine , who has worked as a translator , that the work of an interpreter is so mentally exhausting that only few do it longer than few years . 
  is this true ? 
  how stressful is the work , and how exhausting do you find it ? 
  a good read . 
  thanks for posting . 
  some choise quotes :  when trimborn saved the bernstein family , germany was just beginning to undo european states . 
  when germany absorbed austria in 1938 , jews were humiliated . 
  when germany dismantled czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939 , jews were depatriated . 
  after germany allied with the soviet union in 1939 , each power invaded poland with the aim of annihilating the polish political nation ; the soviet union also destroyed the three baltic states of lithuania , latvia , and estonia , separating jews from their property and traditional legal protections . 
  ...  we can not know the exact scenario that might follow if the trend of state destruction proceeds . 
  what we can say is this : since destroying states was one cause of the holocaust , the holocaust should not be used as a reason to destroy states . 
   they tried to come for video games . 
  they still are . 
  according to the un report video games turn children into `` killer zombies '' :  there is widespread representation of vawg in mainstream culture , including in contemporary and popular music , movies , the gaming industry and the general portrayal of women in popular media . 
  recent research on how violent video games are turning children , mostly boys , into ` killing zombies ' are also a part of mainstreaming violence . 
  and while the presentation and analysis of this research is beyond the scope of this paper , the links to the core roots of the problem are very much in evidence and can not be overlooked . 
  which is of course bullshit as anyone can easily test by looking around and counting the number of killing zombies . 
  so , where did they get that `` recent research '' claim ? 
  turns out their source is neither recent nor research . 
  their source is this polemic published in a crackpot magazine in 2000 : programmed to kill - video games , drugs , and the ` new violence ' http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/new_violence.html the magazine in question is `` an outlet for lyndon larouche 's crank views on science , which tend toward promotion of nuclear energy , denialism of global warming , space-based weaponry , and a lot of quirky and odd science woo . '', 
  ( rationalwiki ) and the article is ... well , try reading it without laughing . 
  it 's insane . 
  there 's simply no other way to describe it . 
  read it and learn how `` we 're getting killings which are caused by the use of nintendo-style games , such as the game pok\u00e9mon , with children '' , about `` nintendo-style killing techniques '' , and how nintendo manufactures `` equipment for satanic video games '' . 
  this from the second paragraph :  yet littleton was only the most notorious of at least eight similar such incidents carried out by child killers , `` manchurian children , '' who learned their deadly skills from video games , and their scenarios from hollywood . 
  the brutal acts of these children exemplify a new phenomena in the world . 
  it is the `` new violence , '' as democratic presidential pre-candidate lyndon larouche was the first to precisely characterize it at the time ( see box ) . 
  i mean , how the fuck did n't that alone ring the alarm bells in the heads of the un rapporteurs ? 
  manchurian children ? 
  lyndon larouche the presidential candidate ? 
  `` nah , nothing fishy about the article , we 'll quote it as ` recent research ' in our report . '', 
  there 's simply no way anyone should confuse that pile of crap with research . 
  i take it the un rapporteurs are either complete nutcases or intentionally misleading their readership . 
  frontpagemag happens to have a short amusing piece about that : [ un : video games turning boys into `` killing zombies '' ] ( http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/260248/un-video-games-turning-boys-killing-zombies-daniel-greenfield )  if the un writes a report on anything , it 's sure to get it wrong . 
  and its `` gamergate '' report is a real credit to the institution . 
  unfortunately that institution is bellevue psychiatric hospital , not the united nations , though they 're located close to each other for mutual convenience . 
  these new puritans pretending to be the real victims make me kinda miss jack thompson . 
   their past proposals also included mechanisms to allow governments to censor parts of the internet via the un yup . 
  the report promotes three imperatives to stop this `` violence '' : 1 . sensitization - `` changing social attitudes and norms is the first step to shifting the way online abuse is understood as a serious challenge . 
  violence is not new , but cyber violence is , and the public needs to recognize this and address it as a priority issue . 
  sensitization to cyber vawg must include educating the next generation of ict users , both boys and girls , through their parents , teachers and wider communities , ** as well as police authorities and the justice systems ** . '', 
  [ in north korea they call it re-education . ], 
  2 . safeguards - `` the second imperative is to put in place and implement safeguards to secure safe online spaces . 
  over the years , traditional vaw safety measures have evolved to include women 's shelters , crisis centres , help lines and education . 
  in light of the new cyber vawg challenge , the digital world also urgently requires safety measures to keep up with a rapidly evolving internet . 
  this will necessarily require resources , attention and ** active participation of industry ( digital gatekeepers ) , civil society and governments . 
  ** '' [ any power-hungry organization will love to do just that - be it a government , a civil society organization with authoritarian leaders promoting their ideology , or a private company using it to maximise their profit and influence in society by becoming a `` digital gatekeeper '' . 
  for example google , here 's julian assagne 's take on google 's ideas : [ google is not what it seems ] ( https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/ ) ] 3 . sanctions - `` third in this multi-level approach to addressing cyber vawg are sanctions , which address laws as well as the will and ability of the courts and legal systems to ** enforce compliance and punitive consequences for perpetrators . 
  ** establishing necessary laws is a starting goal ; the next steps should ensure effective implementation . 
  sanctions however can not on their own accord , define or set societal norms , or deter unlawful activity , or remedy injuries . 
  ** the challenge requires a broad-based societal action ** , engaging all stakeholders . 
  for this reason , while part of the solution , a mere legal reform agenda alone centered on perpetrators or abusers would be limited in both its reach and impact . '', 
  [ these people really do seem to uphold north-korea as a paragon . ], 
  what we have here is feminists joining forces with islamists against freedom of speech by defining speech as `` violence '' . 
  they even define `` blasphemous libel '' as `` violence '' . 
  here 's wikileaks ' take on it . 
  they see it as the danger it is :  online ` gender wars ' instrumentalized by un for mass online #censorship https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/24/the-united-nations-has-a-radical-dangerous-vision-for-the-future-of-the-web/ ...  pushed by sweden : http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/program-teaser-first-sif15-session-revealed/  there is presently ** a dangerous push to redefine insulting online speech as `` violence online '' , which will mandate aggressive state censorship **  dangerous introduction by un women of `` cyber violence '' , to cover insulting speech . 
  saudi arabia is chair of un hrc . 
  http://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2015/9/cyber-violence-against-women-and-girls  ** expect `` cyber violence '' next for insults to islam backed by gulf states . 
  feminists + islamists finally agree . 
  censor all offending speech . 
  **  '' ` cyber [ violence ] includes hate speech ( publishing a blasphemous libel ) , '' - un women/undp cyber vawg report , page 6  un religionists already got there and co-opted protection of women online into defining #cyberviolence to include `` blasphemy '' . 
   this is so stupid that it just looks like a joke . 
  indeed , but unfortunately it 's not . 
  also [ the un report ] ( http://www.broadbandcommission.org/documents/reports/bb-wg-gender-report2015.pdf ) reads as a joke . 
  just look at how poor cherry-picked sources the report uses .
