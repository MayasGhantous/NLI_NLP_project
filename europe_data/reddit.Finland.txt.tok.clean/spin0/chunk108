  i mean , look at this shit they write in the report ( pg 48 ) :  there is widespread representation of vawg in mainstream culture , including in contemporary and popular music , movies , the gaming industry and the general portrayal of women in popular media . 
  recent research on how violent video games are turning children , mostly boys , into ` killing zombies ' are also a part of mainstreaming violence . 
  and while the presentation and analysis of this research is beyond the scope of this paper , the links to the core roots of the problem are very much in evidence and can not be overlooked . 
  let 's break this one down :  recent research on how violent video games are turning children , mostly boys , into ` killing zombies ' are also a part of mainstreaming violence . 
  ( firstly , the sentence is nonsensical . 
  how the hell would ` recent research ' be ` part of mainstreaming violence ' ? 
  but that 's probably not what they mean to say . ), 
  here 's their source for the bold , and obviously false ( all you need to do is look around you and count the number of killing zombies ) , claim : programmed to kill - video games , drugs , and the ` new violence ' http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/ articles/new _ violence.html  recent research the article is from 2000 . 
  not recent at all . 
  and the publication is certainly not a scientific publication . 
  and it 's not any sort of ` research ' either . 
  it 's a tin-foil wrapped polemic published in a crackpot magazine written by a person who is possibly insane or at least has a very vivid imagination with problems in discerning imaginary from reality . 
  here 's what rationalwiki has to say about the magazine : `` 21st century science and technology is a quarterly magazine published by the lyndon larouche organization . 
  the magazine mainly serves as * an outlet for larouche 's crank views on science , which tend toward promotion of nuclear energy , denialism of global warming , space-based weaponry , and a lot of quirky and odd science woo * . '', 
  i dare you all to read that article . 
  it 's a goldmine of insanity . 
  your sides may leave to the orbit . 
  be warned . 
  learn how `` we 're getting killings which are caused by the use of nintendo-style games , such as the game pok\u00e9mon , with children '' , about `` nintendo-style killing techniques '' , and how nintendo manufactures `` equipment for satanic video games '' . 
  and that is `` recent reasearch '' good enough for the un . 
  just fucking look at it , this from the second paragraph :  yet littleton was only the most notorious of at least eight similar such incidents carried out by child killers , `` manchurian children , '' who learned their deadly skills from video games , and their scenarios from hollywood . 
  the brutal acts of these children exemplify a new phenomena in the world . 
  it is the `` new violence , '' as democratic presidential pre-candidate lyndon larouche was the first to precisely characterize it at the time ( see box ) . 
  i mean , how the fuck did n't that alone ring the alarm bells in the heads of the un rapporteurs ? 
  manchurian children ? 
  lyndon larouche the presidential candidate ? 
  `` nah , nothing fishy about the article , we 'll quote it as ` recent research ' in the report . '', 
  that is not an accident . 
  no-one should be stupid enough to confuse that crappy piece with actual research . 
  they have obvioulsy had to reach for the bottom of the barrel to find * any * stuff to try and bolster their nonsense . 
  they even boldly claim that * `` the links to the core roots of the problem are very much in evidence and can not be overlooked '' * , which is nonsense as that 's not evidence . 
  edit : looks like the fun with the sources never ends : [ citation games by the united nations ' #cyberviolence ] ( https://medium.com/@kingfrostfive/citation-games-by-the-united-nations-cyberviolence-e8bb1336c8d1 ) empty citations , duplicates , self-referencing through proxy to obfuscate , unsourced copy-pasta from wikipedia , non-existent sources , even a fucking c : - drive as a source ... my sides ... 
  the incompetence or intentional misleading by the rapporteurs seems to have no limits . 
  but then again , how else would anyone go about defining speech as `` violence '' . 
   i do n't think this is right , alrosa is the worlds largest diamond company . 
  it reported profits of 31bn rubles in 2014 . 
  it says `` all the other companies combined '' . 
  some of the other companies made profit some losses , and the rbc combined those . 
   you can cherry-pick i have done no such thing . 
  the study is very much relevant as it * compares * the cancer rates between meat eating and vegetarian diets in the country in question . 
  pointing to a relevant study is certainly not cherry-picking , unless you 're a mind-reader accusing me of hidden agenda . 
  so , are you a mind-reader ? 
   larsson et al , 2006 ... norat et al , 2002 ... sandhu et al , 2001 none of those seem to be comparing between meat eating and vegetarian diets . 
  according to this uk study vegetarians had higher colorectal cancer rate than meat eaters ( 1.39 ratio ) , but lower overall rate of cancer ( 0.89 ratio ) : http://www.epic-oxford.org/publications/1506/cancer-risk-in-vegetarians  comparing vegetarians with meat eaters and adjusting for age , sex , and smoking , the incidence rate ratio for all malignant neoplasms was 0.89 ( 95 % ci : 0.80 , 1.00 ) . 
  the incidence rate ratio for colorectal cancer in vegetarians compared with meat eaters was 1.39 ( 95 % ci : 1.01 , 1.91 ) . 
   conclusions : the overall cancer incidence rates of both the vegetarians and the nonvegetarians in this study are low compared with national rates . 
  within the study , the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat eaters , but the incidence of colorectal cancer was higher in vegetarians than in meat eaters . 
  edit : and of course , correlation does not prove causality . 
  the study does not show that a vegetarian diet caused lower overall cancer risk or that it caused a higher colorectal cancer risk . 
  it just shows that diet and risk were correlated . 
  is n't it amazing how broad statements one can cook up without citing anythig scholarly . 
  historical consensus ? 
  those are pretty broad statements . 
  it 's only about 7 % of meps . 
  the third quarter of 1952 . 
  first we had summer olympics and then jean sibelius invented sauna . 
  til 50 + meps equals europe, 
   the slow death of social democracy in europe ( in 2 figures ) i think the professor exaggerates . 
  and yeah i know twitter is a medium of concise but that alone does not salvage his claim . 
  he seems to assume that a party having ` social democracy ' in their name equals to social democracy in society . 
  the book was first published already in 1946 , and i see the comet as a symbol of war more than specifically nuclear war . 
  as a pacifist tove jansson hated war , and she hated both hitler and stalin equally : '' [ in drawing political cartoons ] the most i loved the opportunity to be nasty towards hitler and stalin '' , tove jansson in her biography * tee ty\u00f6t\u00e4 ja rakasta * . 
  and the war was indeed present in the first moomin books . 
  in fact jansson wrote the first moomin book during the soviet invasion of finland 1939-40 because she felt that she could not paint any more as `` the colours had died '' , and she decided to try writing instead . 
  in * the moomins and the great flood * ( published in 1945 ) they are looking for the father who has gone missing after going for an adventure , and face the catastrophe of a flood . 
   they can disagree with me but that does n't mean i have to think they 're right . 
  okay , so let 's just agree to disagree then, 
  all those classic swedish tv-series and movies based on lindgren 's works are well worth watching . 
  they are very faithful to the books , to the characters and to the stories . 
  what is most remarkable about them is how well they have aged . 
  one would think that a tv-series from early '70s would be long past its use before date . 
  but they seem to simply defy time , and are as good as any new production would be . 
  and in case of pippi actually far better than the new one : inger nilsson is hands down million times more of a pippi than any animation character . 
  [ olle hellbom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olle_hellbom ) who directed most of them was a genius . 
  he not only adapted the books while keeping it faithful to the original but also somehow managed to get top appearances from the children . 
   pippi longstocking too ( on a nordic children 's literature them ) pippi books are just great . 
  also the original swedish tv-series and movies are very good , and time has not ruined them at all . 
  the modern animation series is not so good , to me it 's like a lame pc-version of pippi . 
  no animation shit , [ because the only real pippi is inger nilsson and will always be . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x-butwttcs ) the classic tv-series is currently running on svt website : http://www.svtplay.se/video/2520376/pippi-langstrump/pippi-langstrump-sasong-1-avsnitt-1 also from the same author astrid lindgren i highly recommend children 's book [ the brothers lionheart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_brothers_lionheart ) . 
  the book has some dark themes dealing with death and stuff , pretty heavy shit over all , but it 's also a beautiful story . 
  there 's also pretty good classic swedish tv-series and a movie based on the book : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xymptrdwmsm and , if you read that you may need some lightening up . 
  [ emil i l\u00f6nneberga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_i_l%c3%b6nneberga ) books were my favourite stories as kid . 
  they 're funny but also deal with serious themes . 
  and there 's a very good classic swedish tv-series too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdopreqtbkk, 
  * when the wind blows * is indeed a gem of a movie . 
  the best nuclear holocaust movie of the cold war times . 
  saw it in theatre at the time , and i still have the comic book and also the soundtrack on lp . 
   oh it 's made by the guy who did the snowman !, 
  the kids will love it !, 
   how exactly is that not a refugee ? 
  it does n't matter if they 've been drafted or not . 
  look , even the unhcr seems to disagree with you . 
   their land is being taken over by militia extremists and they 'd rather live than die trying to protect it . 
  no , iraq has not been taken over . 
  there have been battles with isis in the northern parts of the country . 
   there 's seems to be a lot of animosity towards any young man claiming asylum status because a lot of you armchair warriors seem to think it 's more noble to die fighting . 
  well fuck that attitude . 
  i wan na live and if i was those guys i 'd be up and leaving too . 
  calm down and take a deep breath mate .
