  ooh , sounds very scary indeed . 
  the nightman cometh . 
  interesting essay and the wsj link works just fine . 
  so perhaps you could consider deleting the other post . 
  also , the problem with the archive.is domain is that for whatever reason the site 's administrator has blocked it from some eu countries . 
  and no , i do n't know why , he has only given some vague crazy sounding reasons but afaik never clarified . 
   i was n't outraged over a shirt , nor over a joke ( do n't even remember that one ) nor any of my friends . 
  good for you . 
   not my fault that us feminism jumped the shark . 
  was n't limited to the us . 
   and how am i supposed to `` shot the passion '' in this case ? 
  i just told you . 
  if you 're actually passionate then show it . 
  you saw what happened when people were passionate about a fucking shirt or a lie about a joke - the world heard . 
  but what you 'll hear in this case will be crickets . 
  just watch . 
  and listen . 
  there will be nothing like the outrage of someone wearing a shirt , or telling a joke . 
   but i 'm not going to claim that those cunts are one and the same with every kebab joint owner around . 
  why are you pretending this is the issue ? 
  i never said anything such , and yet you respond to me with this crap . 
  why ? 
  condemned by other feminists, 
   we despise it with burning passion oh you do ? 
  then please do show some of that passion . 
  please do show me the outrage in the western european left concerning this event . 
  there was a conference discussing when beating your wife is acceptable . 
  remember the outrage about * a fucking shirt * ? 
  now there 's an outrage . 
  remember the outrage about * a joke * ? 
  now there 's an outrage . 
  so , if you have a burning passion about this then where is the outrage ? 
   some clever guy comes and derails the conversation with some petty bs by `` some clever guy '' are you referring to me ? 
  if so then please do tell what was the conversation you were having that i derailed , and please do point out the bs so we can further discuss . 
   good on ~ ~ feminists ~ ~ femen confusing those is a bit insulting to the two brave women in the op as western third wave feminists rather shit on femen because of cultural sensitivities and other crap , e.g. 
  [ put your shirts back on : why femen is wrong ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/put-your-shirts-back-on-why-femen-is-wrong/275582/ ), 
   while the false accuser retained her position which she got by lying about her credentials . 
   i consider myself a feminist . 
  as did i until recently when i saw what modern feminism has become . 
  now i consider myself an egalitarian instead . 
  ( here 's a fun dare for you : try saying that to a contemporary third-wave feminist )  if you show a `` progressive '' this video they 'll tell you that femen is `` culturally insensitive '' or another apologist bullshit . 
  and this is exactly what we will hear from prominent feminists . 
  or more likely we 'll hear crickets as they 're hoping the issue would go away from spotlight , while raising a loud outrage about shirts scientists wear or some other bullshit that makes them feel important . 
  and once again the left will be a complicit either by condoning it or by remaining silent . 
  related : [ if leftwingers like me are condemned as rightwing , then what 's left ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/11/mainstream-left-silencing-sympathetic-voices ) * like so many liberals , i have started to self-censor to avoid the wrath of my politically purist friends *, 
   that 's shitty , but really not relevant here . 
  it is relevant as western european ( and north-american ) feminists have been shitting on femen ( e.g. 
  [ put your shirts back on : why femen is wrong ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/put-your-shirts-back-on-why-femen-is-wrong/275582/ ) ) while proceeding with questionable witch-hunts against scientists with idiotic premises , and the progressive left has been supporting that either by actively participating in it or at least by staying silent because they do n't dare to condemn those excessess . 
  the result is that wearing a shirt they decide not to like will create a louder condemnation from them than two women getting assaulted , beaten and kicked in a conference about wife-beating . 
  just watch . 
  and listen . 
  you 'll hear mere crickets about this . 
  nothing like the outrage of someone wearing a shirt , or telling a joke . 
   as opposed to the new academic feminists who prefer to ~ ~ whine ~ ~ ** lie ** on social media about a so-called sexist joke . 
  because that 's what happened . 
  and when that was pointed out with evidence they merely doubled down on that lie . 
  disturbing people . 
  but , to be fair , the discussion was about wife-beating . 
  two recent examples : [ shirtgate ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2mas8t/video_rosetta_mission_scientist_dr_matt_taylor/ ) and [ the timothy hunt witch hunt ] ( https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-timothy-hunt-witch-hunt/ ) . 
  not in uk but i am terrified for the rising probability of uk leaving . 
   ( did n't allow --  bullied ) lol, 
   the last time greece wanted to call a referendum the eu did n't allow it . 
   also greece still is a sovereign nation , they can call a referendum every time they like one of your opinions directly contradicts the other opinion you have . 
  and in just two senteces . 
   yes , frequency , but the article talks about the people who actually die from cancer . 
  and that is the problem with the article . 
  if it was because of depleted uranium then there would be higher occuence , which then could be traced back to the du if it was the cause . 
  but the article only says higher mortality which points to less effective healthcare . 
  ( there are multiple risk factors for cancer such as smoking , alcohol etc. . . )  material with a half-life of 4.5 billion years which means it 's only weakly radioactive , and natural uranium is far more radioactive . 
  does not mean it 's not nasty stuff as uranium is a toxic metal . 
  during the past three decades the us first supported and then fought against saddam hussein and you 're asking what changed . 
  i see you 're not serious , so i 'll just bailout from further discussion . 
  so , according to you the us domestic and foreign policies have remained the same since when ? 
  please give me the year and then we can look at those in detail . 
  because during my lifetime and times before those both have seen a lot of changes , sometimes even drastic ( such as nixon 's ping-pong diplomacy just for one example ) . 
  well , that 's not a very good argument , is it ? 
   its same whoever wins . 
  what is the `` it '' you claim to be `` the same '' ? 
  and in what way is `` it '' the same ? 
   i would argue that 1 +1 in us dont add to 2 by that logic cause its same with democrats/republicans . 
  okay . 
  let 's hear your argument for that . 
   i wonder how liberal and democratic they actually are . 
  thousands have been crossing the border from sweden to finland . 
  alone in the northern border crossing between haparanda , sweden and tornio , finland ( [ on map ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/95400+tornio/@65.8444927,24.1527255,4z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x45d538656beb4761:0x942a610b9d542e48 ) ) the rate is already about 300 per day , and accelerating . 
  yeah , i can see that wibe from what the swedish foreign minister said . 
  it 's all very strange , as if sweden is on it 's own planet with germany . 
  and everyone else just has to accommodate that even if it means breaking the laws we have agreed to together , breaking the quotas we just agreed to together , or creating an acute crisis in neighboring countries . 
  and if you do n't you 're a bad country that should learn lessons from fm margot wallstr\u00f6m 's history colouring book . 
  it 's as if she takes no responsibility whatsoever from sweden 's own actions or lack of it . 
  hey , just out of curiosity , how is the situation in finland reported in swedish media ? 
  are there any reports on the crisis in finland or how the asylym system is collapsing under the influx of people coming from sweden ? 
  because i find the swedish foreign minister margot wallstr\u00f6m 's comments very strange , almost insulting in lack of awareness of the out of control situation while guilting finland . 
  you know , i love our cousin and hockey rival sweden and all , but it 's as if she 's pretending swedish policies , and the related lack of action , have no consequenses whatsoever outside sweden . 
  i mean , what is it that has * prevented * sweden from providing asylym to the asylym seekers they have invited with their policies ? 
  why is n't there huge asylym centers for example in haparanda registering and accommodating the thousands traveling there on their own ? 
  why are they walking to finland while the only thing the swedish fm has to say is guilt tripping finland for it ? 
   it would n't surprise me if we soon get an announcement from the government that we , too , will accept a large amount of these refugees `` to help germany '' or whatever . 
  yeah , would n't be surprising if they did that even as the situation in sweden seems out of control already .
