  i mean , thousands are already crossing the border from sweden to finland . 
  alone in the northern border crossing between haparanda , sweden and tornio , finland ( [ on map ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/95400+tornio/@65.8444927,24.1527255,4z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x45d538656beb4761:0x942a610b9d542e48 ) ) the rate is already about 300 per day . 
  apparently the swedish authorities can not handle even the current influx of asylym seekers - never mind the probable even larger influx in the near future . 
  because those people have certainly not teleported to haparanda but travelled across sweden . 
  so why have n't they been registered to refugee centers in sweden ? 
  why are they travelling from sweden to finland on their own volition ? 
  in finland the result of this sudden influx of asylym seekers is a crisis . 
  with the sudden arrival of thousands the asylym seeker system , which was prepared to accommodate asylym seekers according to the larger quotas agreed in the eu , is now overstrained and the situation is out of control . 
  people have been spending nights on streets at freezing temperatures outside police stations waiting to file asylym applications first thing in the morning , and that 's not because finns would not want to help but because they have just suddenly appeared from sweden on that night . 
  in finland all asylym centers are now full with no rooms left and people have to be accommodated in makeshift beds in corridors and even closets . 
  in northern finland available student housing and community housing has been relegated to accommodate the sudden influx of asylym seekers coming from sweden . 
  and those people are lucky because at least they can sleep indoors . 
  for the rest the quick temporary solution has been accommodation in tents , which is very much temporary as it 's already september and the temperatures are not going to get any warmer towards the winter . 
  the finnish immigration authorities estimate that at current rate finland needs to establish five new asylym centers * per week * just to accommodate the current influx . 
  and that 's just at the current rate - which will probably accelerate . 
  that means family accomodation is needed and people need to open their houses for asylym seekers . 
  the finnish pm already pledged his house to asylym seekers , and said he hopes others will follow his example . 
  and many finns likely will . 
  as the situation is out control in sweden as a result it is now out of control in finland . 
  and yet , so far from the swedish government we have heard just this inappropriate attempt at guilt tripping finland : [ swedish minister raps finland over refugees ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/swedish_minister_raps_finland_over_refugees/8282401 ), 
   people declared fit to work usually dont die within 6 weeks . 
  so no , i dont think that 's normal . 
  so , what is the usual time period when people declared fit to work die ? 
  and how much does that differ from people that were declared not fit to work ? 
  well put :  hunt experienced in less than two months ' time something similar to the process of denunciation , destruction , and rehabilitation that the main character in milan kundera 's autobiographical novel the joke ( 1967 ) endured over a period of many years . 
  set in stalinist czechoslovakia , the joke tells the story of ludvik , a student who sends a jesting postcard to his girlfriend that concludes with the words `` long live trotsky . '' ludvik is actually an enthusiastic supporter of the relatively new communist regime , but that does n't prevent him from being denounced , expelled from college , expelled from the party , and then sent off to a labor battalion . 
  ludvik is too young and naive to understand that totalitarian systems have very limited tolerance for humor and see it as dangerous and subversive . 
  perhaps hunt was too old and naive to realize that the worlds of science , education , and `` science journalism '' are policed by people who are not exactly totalitarians but whose obsession with `` correct '' language and thought is incompatible with humor and intellectual freedom . 
   it is a phenomenon that combines modern ideology with quasi-victorian notions of `` respectable '' behavior and feminine fragility . 
  for these witch-hunters , there can be no toleration of `` inappropriate '' speech by the contemporary equivalent of `` society . '' the wrong kind of joke , breed of joke-teller , or even the wrong political opinion , moreover , creates a `` hostile environment '' that supposedly intimidates the sensitive victim to such a degree that she can not function on an equal level . 
  the hunt affair shows that this way of thinking does n't hold sway on american campuses alone . 
  it has crossed the atlantic and spread outward and upward . 
  i believe it 's from this recent book by former nyt science editor nicholas wade : [ a troublesome inheritance : genes , race and human history ( penguin books ) ] ( http://www.penguin.com/book/a-troublesome-inheritance-by-nicholas-wade/9780143127161 ) excerpt : http://www.penguin.com/ajax/books/excerpt/9781594204463 another : http://time.com/91081/what-science-says-about-race-and-genetics/, 
  everybody , please limit your posts to reposts of ken m. 
   january 2015, 
  kek, 
  wait , what , it 's the second post from the top on my / r/europe front page . 
  it 's right there : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ilhe5/romanian_tv_in_a_nutshell/ how come you do n't see it ? 
   do n't upvote and you 're not even my real mom . 
  upvoted . 
  look , so far 100 % of * your * posts to / r/europe have been self-posts complaining about the number of posts about immigration . 
  it just so happens that there is an immigration crisis going on , and it is no wonder the topic gets attention and garners discussion . 
  if you do n't like that then your obvious first step to improve the sub would be to post something else front page worthy instead of self-posts no-one really cares about . 
   i 'm not that familiar with reddit , what is shadowbanned ? 
  would you be able to see his post if he was shadowbanned ? 
  it 's a ban-system originally designed to stop spambots from posting spam . 
  after a spambot gets added to the shadowban list it can continue posting but in vain as the posts will not be visible to anyone but itself . 
  this is because if you give a spambot a regular ban it will learn about it and will simply create a new account to bypass the ban . 
  the idea with the shadowban is that a less sophisticated bot will merrily continue posting spam which will be visible to no-one . 
  and , as is usual in social settings with such powerful tools of punishment , over time shadowbans have been broadened to be applied to not only spambots but also to people . 
  which is simply awful method of banning users as they will not get any notice about them being banned , no reason why that has happened , and they will keep on posting comments no-one will ever read or vote upon - however insighful or crappy they may be . 
  you may have noticed that sometimes a new post may say it has x number of comments but when you go to read them there 's nothing to see . 
  those comments were by shadowbanned users : either spambots or real persons who have no idea they have been shadowbanned . 
  the only way to get un-shadowbanned is to contact the admins and ask . 
  but that requires one has learned about getting shadowbanned . 
  and there is no notice of getting a shadowban . 
  which sucks . 
  * tree fiddy, 
  but that 's comparing apples to oranges as that number is not the saidi metric , and it also includes outages caused by nature which are excluded from the numbers in the op . 
  additionally your number only covers fingrid . 
  i tried but did n't manage to find directly comparable saidi numbers for the grid in finland as they seem to include natural events which cause by far the majority of outages in finland . 
  i think reddit set an unfortunate precedent when complying with russia 's demands by blocking content deemed illegal in russia . 
  because then the obvious question becomes what else is illegal in russia ? 
  well , for example vaguely defined gay propaganda . 
   above , we see that germany and denmark have the most reliable grids by far in europe of the seven countries they selected for comparison . 
   how do you pronounce that ? 
  a bit sloppy but okay example : http://fi.forvo.com/search/puutiainen/, 
  or you could : 1 . 
  liberate the electricity market for private enterprise . 
  separate the power producer and power transmission companies , and regulate accordingly to prevent harmful monopoly practices . 
  set up a multinational electricity exchange from where to buy electricity at spot market prices : http://www.nordpoolspot.com 4 . 
  set up an easy to use system where consumers can compare the current prices of various power companies and local power transmission companies in order to insta-change to the best contract : http://www.sahkonhintavertailu.fi net result : more competition and generally lower customer prices . 
  also , every single customer can choose whether they 're buying renewable , nuclear , fossil or whatever electricity they prefer and at what price . 
  * fingerpori * is one of the popular daily comic strips over here . 
  it was originally called * karl-barks-stadt * but the name was changed probably due to copyright reasons or whatever . 
  yet the original idea of depicting life in a gdr version of duckburg seems to resonate well with living in finland . 
  unfortunately most of the jokes are double entendres or puns which do not translate well . 
  anyway , here 's some selected strips translated to english . 
  the turd moved back and to the left . 
  back and to the left . 
  relevant article regarding the two biggest gold bullion buyers : [ gold crash costs russia and china $ 5.4 billion in just three weeks ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-06/gold-crash-costs-russia-and-china-5-4-billion-in-just-three-weeks ) but then again they do n't need to sell at current low prices . 
  unlike another goldhoarder venezuela : [ venezuela 's dilemma : gold slump collides with oil crash ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/venezuela-dealt-dilemma-as-gold-slump-collides-with-oil-crash ), 
  well , so far there 's little facts to outrage over . 
  but if you want an outrage then by all means go ahead as you like . 
  we do n't know yet . 
  happened just recently and the details published have been scarce so far : * two us military cargo planes ( c-17 ) * flying from east to west , exact route not publicly known * suspected airspace violation somewhere around \u00c5land , but not in the demilitarized zone * lasted about 15 minutes - which is a long time we do n't know for example what the circumstances were , what was the stated course , was the atc disregarded , what was the response ( interception ? 
  as per the normal procedure the border guard is investigating the incident and reports to the relevant officials which will then decide the next steps based on the report . 
  so , we 'll likely know more about the incident within days to couple of weeks . 
  and [ according to iltalehti ] ( http://m.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015082420232031_uu.shtml ) on monday morning pentagon said to inquiring finnish media that they are not aware of the incident , and also on monday the us embassy said they are aware of it ( well , it 's been in the local media ) and are investigating it . 
  or pretended to be civilian planes like the russians have done .

  jet fuel ca n't melt poop !, 
  yes , very common over here for a football fan to have a favourite foreign team . 
  that also extends to other sports and many hockey fans have also their favourite north american teams in the nhl ( i for one watch every minnesota wild game live even if it means waking up in ungodly hours ) . 
   my pension fund your pension fund was probably part of the problem in causing the contagion and the resulting global rout . 
  when such large and conservative investement funds see a rapid fall in their stock portfolio they often have rules in place for automatic sells at certain percentage points . 
  and when they all start doing that at the same time the rout spreads from one market to another ( e.g. 
  from china & em to elsewhere ) by triggering further sells . 
  and no , it does not make much sense , and no , it was n't just them . 
  but let 's not pretend it was all just speculators .
