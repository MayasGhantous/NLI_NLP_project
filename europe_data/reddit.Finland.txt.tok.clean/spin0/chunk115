  and it 's not like they had much options there . 
  firstly , the opec cartel has less than 40 % market share globally . 
  you do n't get to dictate the prices with that especially when you have been losing your market share . 
  secondly , the opec cartel has a traumatic past . 
  while propping up the oil prices they have acted to the detriment of the world economy but also to their own when their schemes have blown up on their own faces too . 
  sometimes big time as at one point the ` swing producer ' saudi-arabia had to accept their production falling even to fifth of their earlier losing market share in the process ( see what happened in the '80s ) . 
  of which the latest example was the russian betrayal in 2009 when russia had sent high-profile delegations to opec meetings with a message of * let 's all cut production together to prop up the falling oil prices - we 'll cut , we promise * . 
  but when opec did cut their production russia ramped up theirs capturing market share from opec . 
  and we can be pretty sure if there ever was any sympathy for russia within opec the prominent sentiment remaining is a deep distrust towards the dishonest russia . 
  anyway , with the disruptive application of relevant technologies and the high level of experteese they need ( such as : 3d/4d seismology , data processing , precise horisontal drilling , liquid nitrogen cooled drilling etc , etc ) there has been a paradigm shift on the global markets too . 
  these days , after november 2014 , we can safely say it actually * is * about supply and demand . 
  and will be even more so if/when the us legislators ( gradually ) lift their oil export ban - with the rising production there has been more and more pressure to do that : [ congress likely to repeal oil export ban in 2016 , evercore says ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-21/congress-likely-to-repeal-oil-export-ban-in-2016-evercore-says ), 
   xe shows that the trading closed at 21:00 utc . 
  it 's friday night , and trading will resume on monday . 
  you can see how volume is zero , and you can also see how there 's a flatline repeating every weekend : http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=rub&amp;view=1m, 
   but the russian version is n't later , it was made on the same date but i guess it could be a later forgery true ( it seems likelier now ) . 
  it is indeed the later document . 
  the first document is from soon after the incident . 
  in that both russian and estonian border guards agreed that the incident had happened on the estonian side of the border . 
  then later on there was another russian document which claimed the opposite . 
  that document emerged only after it had become clear that the russian state had been involved in the kidnapping . 
   but here 's the translation of the russian version . 
  ( do n't vote on link threads you can get banned ) . 
  afaik there 's two different documents with contradictory versions of events : the original in which both russian and estonian border guards determined that kohver was kidnapped on the estonian side of the border , and a later russian one which claims the opposite . 
  as you seem keen on posting that russian document why do you think it reflects the actual events ? 
   one major factor is the ruble , which has lost more than half its value against the dollar since the beginning of 2014 . 
  that means that even though gazprom 's profit was down in dollar terms , when converted into rubles , it was actually up 71 percent ** in the first quarter of 2015 . 
  ** as natural gas prices reflect oil prices with a lag of several months of course the q1 profits in ruble terms were high : gazprom benefited simultaneously from high gas prices and weak ruble . 
  the same effect will probably give a boost , albeit smaller , also in q2 . 
  and after that the falling gas prices will have more noticeable effect . 
  for example , the russian natural gas border price in germany has fallen about 36 % this year and will continue that trend : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gs4ghvt.png ) the july price was $ 6.68 per million metric british thermal unit or about $ 236 per thousand cubic meters - the lowest since december 2009 . 
  bloomberg : [ u.s. sanctions sour earnings surprise for biggest gas producer ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-10/gazprom-profit-rises-71-on-weaker-ruble-even-as-gas-prices-drop )  the first-quarter result may be `` the last positive period for gazprom in the new price environment '' as foreign-currency revenues decline , pavel kushnir , a deutsche bank ag energy analyst in moscow , said by e-mail on monday . 
   sales rose 5.7 percent to 1.65 trillion rubles , gazprom said in a statement on monday . 
  in dollar terms , though , revenue slid 40.5 percent to $ 26.5 billion , bloomberg calculations based on bank of russia exchange rates show . 
    ...   gazprom 's customers in the european union have been boosting purchases since the end of may as the decline in oil prices filters into gas contracts , with a lag of six to nine months . 
  its average june export price was the lowest since 2007 , bloomberg calculations based on russian customs data show . 
   as prices keep dropping , gazprom earnings will be hurt by the end of the year , deutsche bank 's kushnir said . 
  `` the situation could deteriorate significantly both in free cash flow , and in its ability to pay high dividends '' next year , amid higher spending on a planned gas link to china , he said . 
   what was invaded ? 
  crimea . 
  it 's wabbit season !, 
  yup , it is an alternative :p it 's a well-known finnish ` alternative ' media ( free-of-charge in print and online ) run by a wealthy loopy anti-semite . 
  and of course it 's all just tin-foil wrapped crap . 
  [magneettimedia.com ] ( http://magneettimedia.com/ ) - they 're pretty far from any msm . 
  their current selection of alternative news appear to cover topics such as `` albert einstein , the jewish fraud '' , `` get rid of toxins with the help of suzanne somers '' , `` democracy is a lousy form of governing '' , `` baking soda and cancer treatment '' , and `` the nationalsocialist germany was a christian state '' . 
   could you elaborate on that ? 
  here 's copy-pasted a relevant comment i wrote on askhistorians a while ago : in addition to the already mentioned print media there were also television adverts in the soviet union . 
  those were all made by a single estonian enterprise eesti reklaamfilm which was established in 1967 by peedu ojamaa . 
  the first television adverts in the soviet union were made that same year . 
  the peculiar thing in the soviet system was that the producers of consumer goods had to use certain amount of their budget for advertising . 
  because making a television advert was an easy way to spend that money and eesti reklaamfilm was the only one making them in its heyday it produced hundreds of advert films a year . 
  the enterprise became wealthy and its founder peedu ojamaa a well-off self-made-man . 
  during the 24 years of its existence eesti reklaamfilm made over 5000 adverts . 
  the mandatory advertising spending sometimes led to absurd situations . 
  sometimes adverts were filmed in exotic far-away places just to make sure all the money got spent . 
  or sometimes the goods were not available to consumers even when there were adverts . 
  and sometimes the goods advertised were quite peculiar such as a double-layered outhouse toilet cover . 
  the important thing was the advertising money got spent and creating consumer demand for a product was not always the primary goal . 
  this also led to unusual styles in adverts . 
  one of the advert producers notable for his unique style was harry egipt , here 's his 1986 advert for minced chicken meat ( * kanaa * = chicken ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6lavk1shw8 this dark humour filled energy-saving campaign advert by priit p\u00e4rn won the bronze lion in cannes 1988 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkcuh8k4l8s here 's an interesting documentary telling the remarkable story of eesti reklaamfilm and its founder and director peedu ojamaa : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3216380/ trailer : [ goldspinners trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv6imosbp2o ), 
   i think a bbc specialist said that it 's unlikely to go much below $ 40 to the barrel . 
  and here 's a guy on bloomberg saying it could fall to $ 30 and even lower : [ here 's why supply and demand means $ 30 oil ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-14/here-s-why-supply-and-demand-means-30-oil ) now what ? 
   if it drops to $ 25 per barrel ( highly unlikely ) then the us , norway , russia , and pretty much all major oil producing countries will have to lower production significantly , as even saudi would n't profit under those prices ( and afaik they 're not profiting from the current prices ) . 
  you do not simply lower your production like that . 
  that 's because all the costs of drilling and establishing your production are already sunken costs and after your oil well has started producing oil it would make little sense to close it . 
  when you planned for the project you may have calculated that your break-even price for the project would be say $ 40 per barrel on average over so and so many years . 
  but when your well starts producing oil every drop you sell adds to your turnover even if the price falls to $ 30 , and it would make no sense to shut it down . 
  the actual price point where it would make more sense to shut the well down rather than continue selling its oil is far far lower than the break-even price . 
  that far lower price point is called the shut-in price , and just like break-even price the shut-in price has significant elasticity as producers will be cutting their costs and have hedged against it . 
  here 's good professor 's short informative piece on the fundamental differences between the break-even ( = * fixed costs * ) and shut-in ( = * variable costs * ) prices and the dangers of confusing them : [ deja vu for opec as oil prices tumble ] ( http://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/16368# ) tl ; dr * what matters in the next few years is the shut-in price . 
  * edit : for anyone interested in learning about shale oil , relevant technologies , required experteese , and their implications here 's a very good recent research paper by the same prof paul stevens : [ the shale oil revolution and implications for the gcc ] ( http://english.dohainstitute.org/release/fc73ceed-36f7-48eb-aea0-bf3cce7771f5 ) abstract :  the `` shale technology revolution '' , which began in the united states , will and already is having significant consequences for the gcc countries in terms of energy and geopolitical issues . 
  this paper attempts to consider what those consequences are and might be in the future . 
  it begins by discussing the nature of this `` shale technology revolution '' and then considers how the impact on the united states has already begun to influence directly global energy markets and geopolitics . 
  it also considers how the revolution may indirectly influence global energy markets and geopolitics in the future , and how these influences may have relevance for the gcc countries . 
   uh , it will never go down to 25 $ dollars a barrel , not in the foreseen future at least ... ... until it goes to $ 25 . 
   that 's below the extraction price for most of the world . 
  then proceeds to show a graph of a fucking breakeven price . 
  following concepts may be ralated to the oil price but are all very different : breakeven price . 
  extraction price . 
  shut-in price . 
  none of those is ever the same . 
  they 're all different , and they all have their elasticity . 
  and the first thing to learn is not to mix them . 
   the only way for the price to drop to ... look , you just lost any credibility whatsoever regarding the future prospects of oil prices . 
   also on friday , it was reported that russia and finland might be preparing to go to war with one another . 
   gazprom 's price to germany fell to $ 6.68 per million british thermal units in july , the lowest level since december 2009 that 's about $ 236 per thousand cubic meters ( 1 mmbtu is about 28.26 m ^ 3 of natural gas ) . 
  exactly what i was getting at with my question . 
  add to that the fact that elstat has not provided the actual breakdown on which their number is based , and i would take this `` flash estimate '' with a healthy dose of skepticism . 
  a very interesting interview . 
  and revealing . 
  one of the things i like about alex stubb is his way of speakig openly . 
  wow . 
  someone sent a letter to the guardian !, 
  a very important development . 
  better tell the world , and post it to / r/europe . 
   i personally find this behavior rather strange . 
  you mean not * lagom * enough ? 
  never . 
  and as a matter of fact it never does . 
   very few wrecks from that period have escaped the ravages of sea worms .
