  that 's because of its low salinity baltic sea does not have sea worms . 
  there are hundreds or even thousands of shipwrecks at the bottom of the baltic sea sunken there through centuries and waiting to be discovered for research ( or looting ) . 
  should we actually trust those `` official figures , based on a flash estimate '' ?

  none . 
  now that 's just cute , innit . 
   russia 's economy contracted by 4.6 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2014 , the largest drop in six years , marking the country 's first recession since the financial crisis in 2009 . 
   the federal statistics office did not offer any details with its first estimate , but analysts said the preliminary figure was likely to be revised downward as sectoral statistics -- which includes retail sales , industrial production and household incomes -- pointed to an even steeper drop in real terms . 
   the 4.6 per cent contraction was slightly worse than analysts ' consensus estimate . 
  economists warned that the renewed slide in oil prices , which has pushed the rouble lower , would make a quick recovery even more unlikely . 
   the figure comes after the first quarter of this year when the economy contracted by a relatively mild 2.2 per cent . 
  until june , the russian government had been assuring the public that the worst of the current crisis was over as the rouble stabilised after undergoing a severe depreciation at the end of last year . 
   but the first drop in real incomes during president vladimir putin 's 15 years in power , which came about in december 2014 , has proved a profound obstacle to overcome . 
   according to figures published last month , the slide in consumer spending deepened in the second quarter with retail sales falling by 9.4 per cent in june . 
  growth in the industrial sector , which had been flat in the first three months of the year , also dropped by almost 5 per cent in the second quarter . 
   `` with oil prices having fallen further over the past few months it remains too soon to speak about a recovery , '' said liza ermolenko , an analyst with capital economics . 
   economic growth already slowed to a crawl last year due to a long-running investment dearth . 
  the blow dealt by the oil price drop was worsened by western sanctions imposed over russia 's role in the ukraine conflict , which blocks many russian companies and banks from borrowing abroad . 
   fears that this squeeze would trigger a broader systemic crisis receded when the rouble stabilised around 50 to the us dollar this spring after a steep fall . 
  it has since depreciated to 64 to the us dollar -- raising fresh concerns . 
   `` this is by far the most severe crisis russia has experienced , even if you compare it to 1998 and 2008 , and we have not seen the worst yet , '' said irene shvakman , director at mckinsey in moscow . 
  `` the banking sector may turn out to be the weak link . ''  since last summer , the russian government had promoted import substitution , hoping that the weak rouble would make it competitive again to manufacture goods which russia has largely imported since the collapse of the soviet union . 
  but analysts said the contraction in industrial production showed that any such positive effect had been shortlived . 
  here 's some relevant indicators .

   so what , her family told you directly ? 
  ** fucking obviously ** her family told the media , which has been reporting it almost a week ago . 
  without that you would not now be reading about in daily mail days later and posting links to their reporting as `` news '' . 
  read for example here : http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/08/05/nyheter/syria/is/sverige/40467234/ http://www.iltalehti.fi/ulkomaat/2015080620139228_ul.shtml http://www.iltalehti.fi/ulkomaat/2015080720141302_ul.shtml  how about you come up with your source or you stop talking ? 
  whoa . 
  who promoted you as the arbitator of speech here ? 
  no one , except you . 
  and mistakenly one might add . 
   thanks . 
  well , no problem at all mate and htfh . 
  no need to thank me . 
  that was all made by other people . 
  now read [ the boatmurdered ] ( http://lparchive.org/dwarf-fortress-boatmurdered/ ) , start playing dwarf fortress , and your training is complete . 
   source ? 
  well , as she has not given interviews to the media and the swedish authorities are tight lipped the only source is her family in sweden to whom she has been in contact with , and according to them she was travelling to morocco for a holiday with her boyfriend . 
  but it is possible that she lied to them from the beginning and also later on when calling for help in syria , and that she actually left for the purpose of joining isis . 
  her destination was not syria but morocco where her boyfriend claimed to be taking her for a holiday . 
  probably yes , as 2chan 's impact to the internet culture has been significant . 
  albeit 2chan may refer to * two * different boards : 2channel ( 2ch . net ) and futaba channel ( 2chan . net ) by 2chan i refer to the former . 
  for example 2chan is the originator of many of the * kaomoji * style emoticons which can be read without tilting your head , and which under the last decade or so have become quite popular all over ( i.e. 
  o \\ _ o , ( \\* \\ _ \\* ) , ( t_t ) , ( \\ ^ . \\ ^ ) , etc ) . 
  2chan was the first anonymous board of its kind , and also the inspiration for creation of a western version 4chan which then evolved into the beautiful mixture of the best and the worst in the internet before dying of cancer . 
  and last but not least : 2chan is the board where the legendary thread * densha otoko * ( the train man ) took place in march-may 2004 . 
  that gem of a thread later inspired a novel , a manga , a play , a television series , and a movie - and is widely considered by me as one of the most culturally significant treasures of the internet which should be entered in the unesco world heritage list ( among with [ the street lamp-thread on fark.com ] ( http://www.fark.com/comments/2618004/wtf-did-i-just-take-a-picture-of-i-thought-it-was-a-planet-but-it-looks-really-weird ) and the boatmurdered-thread on something awful ) . 
  the internet archive has a copy of the train man thread translated to english . 
  the premise is simple , a boy meets a girl . 
  but the boy being a virgin * otaku * nerd and the girl being posh and them both being japanese turns the boy 's cries for help into an amazing story . 
  a good read : http://web.archive.org/web/20150112005945/http://www.rinji.tv/densha/, 
  war . 
  war never changes . 
  it will always remain the meaningless word journalists abuse in their headlines . 
  * big wheels keep on turning *, 
   the title of this post no , it does n't . 
  it says a year after the russian import bans the exports have risen . 
  it does not say the growth happened because of it . 
   and most of the comments replying to it no , they do n't . 
  there are currently 57 comments under the post . 
  i can see only * two * comments that attribute the growth to the russian import bans - probably in a tongue in cheek manner . 
  two out of 57 is about 3.5 % of comments which a far cry from `` most '' . 
  * i got ta get myself together , before i lose my mind *, 
   it 's propaganda . 
  no , it 's a statement of fact . 
   the increase is not in any way positively affected by the russian sanctions . 
  the commission does not claim so . 
  [ they say it 's happening `` in spite of the russian ban . 
  '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/russian-import-ban/index_en.htm ), 
  except the commission is not attributing the growth to russia 's embargo .

  why sweden , why ? 
  why do you hate elvis ? 
  what the hell was that !, 
  not to mention the fact that greek consumers pay for the most expensive milk in the eu . 
  for some reason stiglitz fails to mention that , nor does he elaborate on the reasons for the price discrepancy . 
  here 's some background by reuters 2012 : [ price of milk makes greeks ' blood boil ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/22/us-economy-greece-milk-idusbre8al0od20121122 ) so when stiglitz writes :  greeks enjoy their fresh milk , produced locally and delivered quickly . 
  one could translate it into :  greeks enjoy their ~ ~ fresh ~ ~ misleadingly labeled most expensive in the eu milk , milk is fresh when it comes out of cow 's tit . 
  but after that it 's pasteurized and homogenized , and it becomes processed milk . 
  it 's not fresh milk any more , and labeling it as such is misleading . 
  and the restriction of a maximum five days shelf life does not turn it back into fresh . 
  five days old milk is five days old milk , not fresh . 
  all that does is more milk gets thrown away , and the milk prices remain artificially higher than they should be . 
   produced locally produced in small farms , some too small to even grow their own fodder which is bought from somewhere else or even imported . 
  as a result the average farm-gate price they get for their milk is among the highest in the eu but even then the producer margins are small . 
   and delivered quickly . 
  depends on the definition of ` quickly ' . 
  milk costs more on the islands where it 's much slower to transport it . 
  and the shelf life of only five days means more trips to the farms everywhere , and therefore more transportation costs which gets added to the price . 
  yet for some reason to stiglitz greece dropping the misleading label ` fresh ' is a travesty . 
  never mind that greece agreed to do that already in 2012 but has failed to adhere to its commitments . 
  they were for visitors and tourists . 
  in addition to existing hotels in helsinki two new big ones had been built but the organizers anticipated there would not be enough hotel rooms , nor rooming with helsinki residents , to accommodate all the visitors and tourists from finland and other countries . 
  so , also three camping sites with facilities were established in lauttasaari ( pictured in the op ) , lehtisaari and seurasaari for those who could not find other accommodation .
