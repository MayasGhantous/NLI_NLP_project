  [ * saari * = \u00f8y , \u00f6 , island ] even as the camping facilities had been designed for overestimated numbers many foreign and finnish tourists did use them , lauttasaari ( in the op ) being the least popular one . 
  afaik there were about 1600 visitors in seurasaari , 3500 in lehtisaari and only about 350 in lauttasaari . 
  here 's a newsreel from 1952 showing the seurasaari camping site : http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2008/07/07/olympiaturisteja-seurasaaressa-1952 ( in finnish ) and just for fun here 's a relevant advert film from 1952 : [ helsinki prepares for the olympic games 1952 ] ( http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2007/04/11/helsinki-valmistautuu-kisaisannyyteen ) ( in english ) ( to see the videos a proxy of your choise may be necessary as there may be geoblocking involved ), 
  * unanesthetized, 
  the athletes were not accommodated in tents in the 1952 helsinki olympics . 
  whole new neighbourhoods were built for them , and the buildings are still used as housing . 
  most of the athletes were accommodated in two olympic villages built in helsinki neighbourhood k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 . 
  * olympiakyl\u00e4 * neighborhood was built for 1940 olympics which never came , and additional * kisakyl\u00e4 * was built for the 1952 games . 
  both of the projects are still used as housing , and k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 is in fact rather sought-after neighbourhood to live in . 
  a third olympic village was built in otaniemi for athletes from the eastern bloc ( * . 
  those buildings are still used as housing for students of the helsinki university of technology . 
  only finnish athletes had to endure military accommodation but not in tents . 
  because the olympic villages were full they were accommodated in the santahamina military base . 
  olympiakyl\u00e4 [ in 1940 ] ( http://www.docomomo-fi.com/uploadkuvat/ekelund-valikangas-olympiakyla-helsinki.gif ) , and [ in 2007 . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/olympiakyla.jpg/800px-olympiakyla.jpg ) relevant espn article : [ 60 years on , helsinki 's olympic legacy endures ] ( http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=oly&amp;amp;id=8188709 ) edit : * ) they were not actually built for that purpose . 
  originally they were ment for female athletes , as in those times accommodating male and female athletes in the same housing was not considered proper . 
  then it emerged that the soviet union , which was participating in the olympics for the first time with full team , was requesting that their athletes should be accommodated separately from other countries and was followed by other countries from the newly formed eastern bloc . 
  so , the otaniemi housing was eventually reserved for the eastern bloc , and other housing was organized for the female athletes ( medical academy in meilahti , helsinki ) . 
  the original imf piece : [ euro area recovering , but lasting growth requires collective push ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/car072915a.htm )  the euro area recovery is strengthening , but the weak medium-term outlook calls for focus on four key areas : increasing demand , cleaning up bank balance sheets , stepping up structural reforms , and strengthening governance , said the imf 's latest review of the currency union .

   stalin 's great purge started in 1936 the communists had started their mass murders already right after 1917 . 
  it was certainly not limited to stalin 's great purge only which was another event in long line of mass murders by communists . 
   from a socialist perspective , class relates to the means of production . 
  from a sociological perspective , it relates to income levels . 
  either way , you live in a class based society . 
   classless :  : without social or economic classes : not grouping people according to their social or economic level  : not connected to a particular social or economic class  class :  : a social stratum sharing basic economic , political , or cultural characteristics , and having the same social position both of which are merely artificial groupings of people , and neither of which prevents people from belonging to multiple groups or moving from one group to another . 
  you can always make up a notion of class by which you can define any society as a class-society . 
  yet in practice the social mobility in my country is among the highest in the world , and we do n't need communism for that . 
   if obtainable , a classless society would be a great goal . 
  personally , i think it 's a tad bit idealistic , but noble . 
  hey , i already live in a classless society . 
  the problem is you types who have deeply ingrined notions of class in your mind , in your culture , and in your societies lecturing to others because of your history . 
  you just can not let it go , can you ? 
  ( inb4 getting a redefintion of words class and classless . ), 
  edit :  we should n't . 
  banning nazism does n't deal with the root of the problem . 
  in which you confuse a party with an ideology . 
  i spoke of nazi party , now you changed it to nazi ideology . 
  those two are different things . 
   if we 're being realistic , not all forms of communism are the same and insinuating they are , is disingenuous . 
  hey , i can play that game too : not all forms of fascism are the same and insinuating they are , is disingenuous . 
  which is pretty stupid thing to say because the success stories leading to better society for all are just as scarce for both of them . 
   provided , they achieve their goal via democratic means , they should n't be banned . 
  and what a great goal that is . 
  by that logic we should also not ban nazi parties provided they achieve their goal via democratic means . 
  but oh , they already did , did n't they . 
  and what a glorious achievement that was , was n't it . 
   nope , source according to your quotations the actual quotation is disputed . 
  but it would be all the more ironic if it actually was ` communists ' instead of ` socialists ' . 
  because the only ones that hated socialists more than even the nazis were the communists . 
  they even joined forces with nazis against the socialists . 
  essentially , they never spoke out for the socialists . 
  maybe there 's a lesson or two to be gleaned from that - but i bet not you nor your actress are ones to learn from that . 
   first they came for the communists then maybe you should not have started murdering everyone else . 
  it 's like the fucking isis complaining how everyone is against them , or nazis pretending to be the real victims . 
  what the communists did is go for everyone else , kill defenseless people in massacres , and their barbaric brutality was only later on paralled by the nazis .

  * * then they came for the trade unionists , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a trade unionist . 
  * * then they came for the jews , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a jew . 
  * * then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me . 
  indeed . 
  true to their style politico has gone for a clickable headline and a story that reads more like prose than analysis . 
  the true story therein is simple : for his plan katainen just got a $ 8.5 bn pledge for investment from the hardest place . 
  and suddenly the plan does not sound as loopy as some said before . 
   my original comment in your original comment you claimed `` the industry has largely moved into freelancing '' . 
  that is not very informative and may be or may not be true depending on what industry it is you 're referring to . 
  and even worse , depending on what `` industry '' you 're referring to your claim may be even counterfactual . 
  apparently in your opinion there is an industry that does that . 
  that may very well be true . 
  what is still lacking is the information of what specific industry and the data to support your claim . 
  hence i 've been asking for you to be more specific - but apparently in vain as you still have n't provided even after this long exchange . 
  and you know what : i give up . 
  as you have n't provided so far it is obvious you will no provide * at all . 
  *  i 'm not a fucking idiot . 
  well , merry christmas mr lawrence . 
  while i may be stupid i 'm not a fucking idiot either . 
  and i can not help but see that you still have n't presented anything to back up your claims . 
  so , do you have actually something to back your claims up or not ? 
  no , you do n't . 
  and how do we know that ? 
  we know that because if you had any of such to provide you would have done it hours ago already , mr another-regular-redditor-talking-out-of-ass . 
  so , you 're saying none of the industries i listed use hired artists ? 
  yeah , how awful of me to call bullshit for what it is . 
  i asked you very simple questions . 
  i asked for your elaboration on your claims . 
  you give bullshit links instead . 
   and asked for better studies better studies than what ? 
  you have not provided * any * studies . 
  you just ** linked to fucking blogposts !, 
  ** and you acting all insulted now is just the cherry on the cake . 
   the creative industry . 
  i do n't know of industry which is not creative . 
  look , i listed some specific industries . 
  then you informed us by claiming that `` the industry has largely moved into freelancing '' . 
  yet in all industries i listed in-house artists are still needed and hired . 
  so please be more specific : which one of those industries does not use hired artists ? 
   for starters , a few links . 
  the links did not provide answers to my questions . 
  but thanks for posting some bullshit blogposts instead of actual answers to simple questions .
