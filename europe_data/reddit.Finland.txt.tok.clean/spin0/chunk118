  and under this same post i already demonstrated at length how wonkblog 's matt o'brien is in fact full of crap . 
   do you really mean that you as a finn do n't know how the euro is hurting you ? 
  as a stereotypical finn i mean what i say . 
  and i tought i was pretty clear on what i said . 
  ** i presented you with three simple questions . 
  yet you answered none of them . 
  ** but you obviously can not answer even those basic questions , as instead of providing an thoughful answer supported with any kind of an actual analysis you give me three links to blogposts . 
  so , the only way i can read your lack of answers is that you have little idea of what you are talking about . 
   link nr 3 is a clear example you are now suffering from internal devaluation ( something you do not want , but need to , since you do n't have your own currency , google it :-) ) . 
  okay , let 's compare the change of wages between sweden and finland , shall we : [ graph you idiot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mwy2d9g.png )  the euro is bad for everybody , even germany in the long run . 
  ah , so that 's where you 're coming from . 
  no wonder you avoid answering simple direct questions , because `` the euro is bad for everybody '' . 
  that 's what ideology does to people and their ability to think . 
   if you read up on optimal currency areas it is clear that the ez is anything but . 
  thank you captain obvious !, 
  i believe you felt very smaert when you wrote that . 
  well fucking of course it 's not an ` optimal currecy area ' , and none such has ever existed nor will ever exist . 
  and i do n't know why you believe for something to be beneficial it has to be ` optimal ' , and you 're very much mislead on that belief of yours . 
  it should be fucking obvious that being member of the emu and the ez has both positives and negatives . 
  yet for some reason you fail to account for them even when specifically asked . 
  it 's as if you do n't even know what you 're talking about . 
  perhaps you 're making yourself looking stupid on purpose . 
   what do you have on sweden , norway , denmark for example ? 
  i do n't even know what you 're asking about . 
  i have nothing on sweden , norway and denmark - in fact i fondly like all of them . 
  or did you ask that as an effort of trying to make yourself look not only stupid but also insane ? 
  or are you just trolling ? 
   it is not like your need is exactly attuned to germany , and frankly , you need more qe and inflation . 
  yet it is sweden - with their own currency and all - that has been struggling with deflation in need of inflation for years already : [ just fucking look at the fucking the graph you idiot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oringis.png ) how fucking stupid does one have to be not to be aware of any of that ? 
  because that 's pretty fucking ** obvious ** innit ? 
  yet * you * go strolling around here as if it 's not happening . 
  as a silly cunt would do , or even worse a fucking liar . 
   it has also made studies that proved that while finland had an initial jolt of joining the euro , they have since then lost to sweden . 
  i have read multiple academic papers on the subject but i have never seen a paper that has `` proved that while finland had an initial jolt of joining the euro , they have since then lost to sweden . '', 
  in fact that sounds like something a swedish nationalist would write as if instead of eu economy it was a competition where finland would `` lose to sweden '' . 
   sweden has benefitted from having a financial politic and a central bank that is aimed at helping swedes , aiding sweden to recover . 
  well , how good for you . 
  now go and deal with the chronic deflation of yours since 2013 . 
  came here to post that iconic picture - the 1952 olympic games were important on so many levels . 
  helsinki had been chosen to host the 1940 olympics but for obvious reasons there were no olympics then . 
  and after the war hosting the 1952 olympics had a profound effect in finland . 
  let 's move on through the decades in finnish history . 
  being a fan of politics i 'll concentrate on some iconic images about politics . 
  [ hawaii , 1962 ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/384168/landscape16_9/1024/576/47e643509ca672e47960fafdd8223071/kf/1614546.jpg ) during his official two-week visit to the us the finnish president urho kekkonen ( second from right ) is discussing with his delegation [ the sudden note sent by nikita khrushchev referring to a threat of war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/note_crisis ) a watershed moment in finnish history sealing the power of kekkonen for decades to come . 
  kekkonen successfully handled the crisis , in order to relax the relations he travelled to novosibirsk and did sauna and fishing with khrushchev . 
  later on more and more historians and analysts have been saying it was a manufactured crisis designed to achieve just that : to keep kekkonen in power . 
  [ helsinki , 1975 ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/978/1288733364223.jpg ) discussion between the us president gerald ford , the soviet general secretary brezhnev , and finnish president kekkonen . 
  after years of work kekkonen had finally managed to assemble a top-level meeting where the leaders of the west and the east would meet and discuss in the [ conference on security and co-operation in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organization_for_security_and_co-operation_in_europe#history ) . 
  this conference and the accords signed here would define europe for decades to come . 
  and little did the soviet union realize that the helsinki accords they signed would be the first step in their collapse ( which is probably one of the reasons why putin 's russia has turned to hate that liberty , and is constantly breaking the very accords designed to uphold peace in europe ) . 
  president kekkonen is aided by his bodyguards on his daily walk in the park of the presidential residence , 21st oct 1981 . 
  his health problems were already known and by now had became obvious . 
  kekkonen resigned five days later . 
  it was time for him to move to the haze of history . 
  and then over that decade there indeed were some changes , not only in finland but pretty much everywhere . 
  the whole world order changed dramatically . 
  so much happened and so rapidly i honestly do n't know what would be the iconic one . 
  i would choose a picture of the estonian statesman lennart meri when he was in helsinki during the [ 1991 soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_soviet_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat_attempt ) , when everyone else pretty much shat their pants except for him . 
  during those dramatic days to him the coup was merely the final seal for ending the occupation of estonia and for the restoration of independence . 
  and he was , of course , right . 
  [ so , for 1990s i present this image of him , and even as i 'm not sure if it is of him in helsinki during the coup it tells all you have to know . 
  ] ( http://www.viro-instituutti.fi/tapahtumia/images/l_meri.jpg ) lennart meri was a great statesman and european . 
  i wish there was more politicians like him . 
  people of the statesman caliber . 
  europe and the eu needs them now . 
  i also wish there was more folklorists , writers , and documentarists like him . 
  but to expand on op 's theme . 
  what would be the iconic photograph not only to each of our countries but to the whole of the eu and by extension europe ? 
  in that sense , of all the numerous iconic pictures of our common history , [ to me it 's this . 
  ] ( http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/images/gefallenenehrung%20verdun.jpg ), 
  impressive work . 
  you 're obviously skilled in your line of work . 
  as i said in another comment the digital world needs skilled artists , quite a lot actually . 
  skilled artists are needed in various industries ( games , web development , tv , movies , advertising , publishing , product and packaging design , etc etc ) in various jobs ( ad , concept artist , content creator etc etc ) . 
  i think it 's pretty likely you 'll be able to find a job in the eu . 
  so , my advice to you is : 1 . do n't primarily go the refugee route even if you could fulfill the criteria . 
  i do n't know how it is in other eu countries but in my country it 's the slow route . 
  all the paperwork , bureaucracy and waiting for the decision for several months is stressful , a hassle , and means you really can not land a good job any time soon because no-one will hire a person with unclear immigration status still waiting for the decision by the immigration authorities . 
  keep that only as a plan b if nothing else works for you . 
  2 . start looking for a job in the eu . 
  there are hundreds or even thousands of enterprises in the eu , from small startups to big companies , that do need your kind of skills and could hire you . 
  the trick is to find them , and then to convince them . 
  use the internet . 
  start looking for companies or startups that could use your skills , and send your portfolio to hundreds or even thousands of them . 
  do that even if they have no open positions on their homepage . 
  set up a homepage where you can refer people for more of your works . 
  also check out the national national employment authorities in various countries for open positions - they 're often limited but never hurts to check - and you 'll also get vital immigration information . 
  here 's some essential links for the nordic countries : [ apply for work in the nordic countries ] ( http://www.norden.org/en/job-opportunities/apply-for-work-in-the-nordic-countries ) 3 . play your strengths . 
  remember , you being from syria is also a strength for an artist because with your background you would certainly bring something new adding to the existing , and in creative business that is often a strength . 
  not to mention language & culture skills which could be relevant to an export oriented company . 
  also stop that `` please do n't hate me '' thinking . 
  no-one hates you for being from syria , and you and i and we all know that assholes are a marginal group . 
  everyone else knows that except the marginal assholes , who delusionally believe they 're speaking for everybody . 
  4 . at the moment do n't be too picky about the country . 
  landing a job in the netherlands right away would be great but also bit of a long shot . 
  i think it would be better to aim for a job in the eu first , in any eu country , and then see how it goes from there . 
  perhaps then later on you could seek for opportunities to finally move to the netherlands . 
  and i know you 're tired of and stressed about moving around , but that is what your life has become as of now for reasons that are beyond your control . 
  to have that situation better in the future , to find a permanent home , you will probably have to be ready to move at least for some time .
