  and most importantly , good luck . 
  i wish it all goes well for you . 
   the industry has which industry of the multiple one 's i just listed ? 
   a skilled worker with an art degree ? 
  even the digital world needs skilled artists , quite a lot actually . 
  skilled artists are needed in various industries ( games , web development , tv , movies , advertising , publishing , product and packaging design , etc etc ) in various jobs ( ad , concept artist , content creator etc etc ) . 
   they have done everything right , to the letter , and they are still suffering negative consequences from the euro . 
  could you please elaborate on that . 
  what are the negative consequences euro has caused to finland ? 
  how big they are ? 
  are they bigger than the positives ? 
  fucking hell what a load of bollocks . 
   but what we can do , as paul krugman points out , is compare how finland has done to a similar country that does n't use the euro -- a country like sweden . 
  and that , as you can see below , is a pretty ugly picture . 
  finland and sweden grew almost identical amounts between 1989 and 2008 , before diverging 20 percent since then . 
  the fairest conclusion is that , given that so much has befallen it , finland would have fallen behind even if it 'd kept its old currency , the markka , but that it 's fallen even more than that because the euro has taken away its ability to do anything about everything that has happened to it . 
  all it can do is try to cut costs ever more religiously . 
  so much wrong in that . 
   but what we can do , as paul krugman points out , is compare how finland has done to ** a similar country ** that does n't use the euro -- a country like sweden . 
  their premise is simply wrong : finland and sweden are certainly not similar , and there is no reason to expect for their economies to have performed similarily . 
  and it is not only misleading but also stupid to use the gpd as a sole indicator and then go leaping into conclusions . 
  what he should do is compare the structures of the economies : industry , domestic demand , and exports in both countries , and then account for the differences . 
  one huge difference between sweden and finland is the industrial base and exports . 
  as the blogist himself points out finland has obviously suffered from too homogenic exports leaving the country vulnerable both to the global market changes and to the global downturn . 
  finland 's another obvious weakness is and has always been that the exports are mostly investment driven products ( okay , we used to export phones to consumers too , but you know what happened ) . 
  that means the exports will go down a lot in a global downturn , and will remain low for a long time . 
  and that 's because in other countries the consumers wo n't buy as much stuff as they did before , so the industries making those products do not invest into new production , which means finland 's investment driven exports will suffer badly . 
  and it wo n't improve right after the downturn is over and consumer demand starts growing again . 
  no , after a downturn the industries will have excess capacity to fulfill the growing consumer demand . 
  only later on when industries project that they will need new capacity will they start making new investments , and the demand for finland 's investment driven exports will rise . 
  sweden has much more heterogenic industrial base and export structure which includes a lot of consumer driven exports too . 
  which means changes in some markets disrupt only some of their exports ( heterogenity ) , and after a global downturn the demand for exports picks up quickly ( consumer driven exports ) . 
  in effect their exports wo n't dive as deep and will also recover quicker . 
  i wo n't even go into the differences in domestic demand , should be bloody obvious , and yes even to an opionator blogist never mind to an economist with a nobel . 
  but i 'll just do what they both have chosen to do , i 'll just wave my magic wand and step over the obvious pretending it does n't exist while claiming to be writing informed opinions based on facts . 
   the fairest conclusion is that , given that so much has befallen it , finland would have fallen behind even if it 'd kept its old currency , the markka , but that it 's fallen even more than that because the euro has taken away its ability to do anything about everything that has happened to it . 
  the only fair conclusion here is that you 're making false assumptions and then leaping into conclusions with far too little data . 
   all it can do is try to cut costs ever more religiously . 
  religiously ? 
  seriously ? 
  yet * you 're * the one leaping to conclusions with false premises and far too little data . 
  i mean , you use the % - change of gdp only , what the hell ? 
  if i had to choose i 'd say it is you who is religious here based on that behavior . 
  and what a glorious religion it is : * thou shalt not make cuts on public spending . 
  * you do realize finland 's public spending has been running ** on deficit for fucking six years in a row already ** . 
  on fucking deficit . 
  and as your own graph just demonstrated that has not produced growth . 
  in fact the opposite has happened . 
  yet you have the audacity to call actually cutting the public spending `` a religion '' ? 
  and then you claim others have to do something even more stupid : * thou shalt not cut public spending , and thou shalt drop a stable currency for an unstable one . 
  * yeah , i 'm sure that would not cost you anything . 
  but i 'm old enough to remember the devastation it caused the last time was done . 
  and maybe you too should look at that before proposing it as a remedy again . 
  there 's plenty of very good academic research available on the '90s economic crisis in finland - there 's even a very good research paper comparing the crises and their handling between sweden and finland . 
  have you read any of them ? 
  no you have n't . 
  because if you had read any relevant academic research then you would cite it . 
  has your favourite opionator krugman read any of them ? 
  no he has not . 
  because if he had read any relevant academic research on the subject then he would cite it . 
  both you opionators simply shoot from the hip , both of you first choose your opinion and then go on to cherry pick the data point to be harnessed to support it . 
  you do not even * try * to be informative but obfuscate as much as possible . 
  and of course you 're free to do exactly that , but that also means the value of your opinions is the same as the value of an asshole or two in an ocean of seven billion assholes . 
  but let 's see about the cuts on public spending anyway , shall we . 
  over the last decade ** sweden has been cutting public spending far more than finland ** . 
  and i could easily promote the cuts to public spending as the reason for sweden 's gdp not taking the same hit as finland 's in a crisis . 
  but i 'm not going to go full retarted and i leave that as your personal turf you and your personal trainer with a nobel can keep . 
  yet is n't it just fucking interesting that despite having their own currency sweden has had to make drastic cuts to their public spending including health care , education and defence ? 
  it almost looks as if having an own currency is not the silver bullet for avoiding cuts in public spending . 
  and then there 's this gem :  it would also keep inflation from falling too much -- it 's actually negative now -- which , in turn , would make debts a little easier to pay back and keep households spending and businesses investing a little more . 
  ** ooh , more inflation with own currency you claim . 
  let 's compare to sweden then , shall we ? 
  ** [ graph1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oringis.png ) [ graph2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dkjp1rk.png ) well , is n't it just fucking interesting that despite having their own currency sweden has struggled with deflation far longer than finland or even the ez ? 
  it almost looks as if having an own currency is not the silver bullet for keeping the inflation from falling . 
  but for some reason you do not inform about those facts in your blogpost . 
  apparently no-one needs to know any of that , and that 's probably why you chose not to share any useful information at all in your blogpost . 
  which is only reasonable if one believes that all one needs to know about economy is the % - change of gdp . 
   but facts are no match for faith it 's not facts but the lack of facts in the blogpost and the blogist jumping to conclusions - while accusing others of being religious and acting of faith - that is the issue here . 
  i do like some of the military marches , not because of kickass nationalism but because of their history . 
  the marches carry the memory of how our own history has entwined with the larger history of europe , and knowing the relevant history i can relate to those guys in those times . 
  * [ march of the finnish cavalry during the thirty years war ( 1618 - 1648 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yskw4sju4 ) or march of the hakkapeliittas . 
  those days finland was part of sweden , and i like how swedish and finnish cavalries still share this battle march as part of our common military history . 
  was a long horrible war , [ hakkaa p\u00e4\u00e4lle !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta ) * [ suomen kaartin paluumarssi - the finnish guard 's return march ( from the russo-turkish war 1878 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gztgznljqw4 ) . 
  then finland was an autonomous grand duchy in the russian empire . 
  finns were fighting with romanians and bulgarians for romanian and bulgarian independence against ottomans . 
  one especially memorable victory was [ the battle of gorni dubnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_gorni_dubnik ) . 
  i can easily imagine the soldiers marching back home to finland singing this . 
  got ta love the lyrics : * `` long we have suffered cold and hunger , fighting in the balkan mountains ... '' * * [ jean sibelius : j\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rimarssi - j\u00e4ger march ( 1917 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7b8e2lgly4 ) written and composed in defiance of the russian rule . 
  in 1915 -- 1918 almost two thousand finnish volunteers clandestinely travelled to germany which provided them military training as j\u00e4gers . 
  the lyrics are about defiance and longing for independence . 
  * [ muistoja pohjolasta - memories from the north ( 1917 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3qmtghriw ) the finnish j\u00e4gers . 
  in germany . 
  training , missing home , and writing kickass military music . 
  my favourite tv-cook , second only to the absolute favourite ever keith floyd ( who shall live forever but rip ) , hails from portugal traveling around and cooking local portuguese cuisine from the local fresh stuff of the season . 
  and [ the meals sebasti\u00e3o castilho makes ] ( http://www.24kitchen.fi/portugalin-makuja ) with the help of locals are awesome . 
  while i 'll be mostly unable to follow his recipes to the letter with all the fresh local ingredients he uses , his style of cooking , the simple and straightforward way of doing it and his presentation wins my heart every time and truly has been an inspiration even over here at these high latitudes . 
  sebasti\u00e3o castilho knows how to do it , and i thank him for that . 
  yet regarding portugal my big sudden realization moment was seeing the wim wenders ' film * lisboa story * . 
  finland hade become an eu member in january 1995 , and then in the summer i saw that movie .
