   and the swastika guy is actually a finish pilot . 
  well , have you asked those guys what their personal ideologies are ? 
   only putler can be of nazi . 
  some of the defining characteristics of a fascist government : * the cult of tradition * strong emphasis on nationalism , constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia * disdain for basic human rights * identifying enemies / scapegoats as a unifying cause * disproportionate amount of government spending on military * rampant sexism / racism * state control of mass media * suppression of civil liberties * obsession with national security * protection of industrial and business aristocracy * obsession with crime and punishment * rampant cronyism and corruption * fraudulent elections * cult of personality around the leader * disagreement is treason, 
  by toutatis !, 
  how did that happen ? 
  speaking of intelligence , do you see the difference between the following strings of characters : j-i-v-a-t-m-a-n and n-o-k-t-o-q-u-e ? 
  just to cheer you up , here 's the flag of the [ finnish air force training air wing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/training_air_wing,_finnish_air_force ) : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/lentosotakoulu.svg/250px-lentosotakoulu.svg.png yeah , obviously we have a nazi air force and by extension we 're probably all nazis . 
  edit : point being : game of spot the nazi is pretty silly if one goes about it by occurence of symbols . 
  with that you will get pretty random results because symbols do have various meanings , and related to an individual occurence of a symbol does not tell why and how it is being used by the individual . 
  if one is to make claims related to an ideology in a certain group of people then the best way to go about it would be to conduct surveys regarding their actual thinking and ideology , and then use that data as a basis of conclusions . 
  looks like that code is written in [ whitespace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whitespace_%28programming_language%29 ) . 
  working with it may indeed be a bitch . 
   it still does not explain why the kev government refuses to release the radio coms between air traffic control in kiev and the plane . 
  the investigation led by the dutch safety board has had the ukrainian atc recordings from the beginnig . 
  it 's just another kremlin lie that it has been somehow kept away from the investigation . 
  furthermore , the data is confidential and will not be published . 
  nothing exceptional in that as they never are . 
  publishing it would be in breach of the agreed upon code of conduct as defined in [ the icao annex 13 - incident reporting , data systems and information exchange ] ( http://www.icao.int/safety/ism/icao%20annexes/forms/allitems.aspx ) . 
  the * results * of the investigation will be published , and the preliminary report was published today . 
  it is common for the investigation to take its time until the final report is ready . 
  sometimes that may take even years . 
  the icao recommendation is :  6.6 recommendation . -- the state conducting the investigation should release the final report in the shortest possible time and , if possible , within twelve months of the date of the occurrence . 
  if the report can not be released within twelve months , the state conducting the investigation should release an interim report on each anniversary of the occurrence , detailing the progress of the investigation and any safety issues raised . 
  so , do not expect ( or as russia has done , demand ) for the black box or atc recordings to get published . 
  they never are . 
  sometimes only relevant snippets of those have been published as text - not the recordings themselves . 
  in some rare cases some parts may have been leaked before the results , but that is very rare and as a breach of code of conduct may compromise the investigation . 
  i think [ radio yerevan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_yerevan_jokes ) may come back in style in the future . 
  how are they ` being assisted by the majority of the world ' ? 
  also , why is it that the nazi spotters have often failed to also spot the [ militant pro-russian neo-nazis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_national_unity ) including the self-proclaimed leadership of the ` people 's republics ' in eastern ukraine ? 
  yes , the russian mod claims were mere speculation based on a sudden appearance of an unidentified ( primary ) radar echo - which might as well have been debris of the missile hit and disintegration of the plane . 
  additionally according to the dutch safety board investigation the closest aircraft was 30 km away from mh17 based on radar data . 
   that would be the end of finnair . 
  the asian flights are the only thing keeping them alive . 
  as that would not be the end of their asian flights , i fail to see how it would be the end of finnair . 
  while rerouting the flights would make them longer , take longer time , and use more fuel that would apply to many other competing airlines too , and there 's also other ways to compete . 
  i also disagree with your assessment that the routes are the only thing keeping finnair alive . 
  they are a significant part of their passenger business revenue , but not most of that , and finnair has also other sources of revenue and profit . 
  and while the e and se asia routes do make a big part of finnair 's profits from passenger traffic , i certainly do not think the company would go bankrupt if some of those routes would become longer . 
  but , nevertheless , while i disagree with your alarmist statement i agree that finnair would face difficulties . 
  and to the left and above the centerline, 
  * and you 're not even my real mother * , so there . 
  how about that ` bullets ' hypothesis ? 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  edit : i already explained very clearly from the very beginning how it 's not ` bullets ' nor ` air cannon ' that brought the plane down . 
  one more time : `` there were no air cannons within range and the observable damage on the wreckage is not consistent with air cannon damage . 
  that leaves us with a missile with a fragmentation warhead . '', 
  no ` air cannon ' , ` cannon ' nor ` bullets ' brought the plane down because there were no such things within the range of the plane , and the damage is not consistent with such . 
   there was other testimony at around the time as well . 
  [ including two associated press reportes ] ( http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/report-flight-17-likely-downed-outside-impact ) who witnessed a buk missile system in the area only three hours before the crash . 
   however , just three hours before the plane was shot down above rebel-held territory in eastern ukraine , the associated press reported on the passage of a buk m-1 missile system -- a machine the size of a tank bearing four ground-to-air missiles -- driving through the rebel-held town of snizhne near the crash site . 
  also :  a highly placed rebel officer told the ap in an interview after the disaster that the plane was shot down by a mixed team of rebels and russian military personnel who believed they were targeting a ukrainian military plane . 
  elaborate on what ? 
  can you elaborate on your hypothesis of ` bullets ' : what is the origin of your ` bullets ' ? 
  as i said , there were no cannons within range ( btw : cannons fire * shells * ) . 
  and if there were ` bullets ' why the damage is not consistent with ` bullets ' ? 
  as you can clearly see in the images ( fig . 
  8,9,10 ) the puncture holes vary a lot both in their shape and size which is not consistent with ` bullets ' . 
   the pre-report says `` high energy projectiles '' , bullets fullfil this definition . 
  does not imply there were bullets . 
  many things may be considered ` high energy projectiles ' . 
  does not mean all of them would be applicable . 
   or do you mean something else ? 
  i mean what i already said : the damage is not consistent with cannon damage . 
   but how do we know that ? 
  because there is no evidence of a cannon within range , and the damage is not consistent with cannon damage . 
   i meant air based not land based cannon . 
  i know . 
  and as i said there were none within range . 
   air cannon burst . 
  which hypothesis can be safely eliminated as there were no air cannons within range and the observable damage on the wreckage is not consistent with air cannon damage . 
  that leaves us with a missile with a fragmentation warhead . 
   is that right ? 
  yes , of all the countries in the world the soviet union/russia is most experienced in shooting down civilian flights . 
  [ kaleva shootdown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaleva_\\ ( airplane \\ ) ) [ korean air lines flight 902 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_902 ) [ korean air lines flight 007 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) additionally , russian militants supported and armed by russia shot down [ * three * civilian airliners ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transair_georgia_airliner_shootdowns ) in abkhazia . 
  and as the most recent incident there 's mh17 . 
   initial report promised to come out in 5 days yep . 
  just as a heads up : the preliminary report of the ongoing investigation by the dutch safety board will be published tuesday 9 september 2014 08:00 hours utc : http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014 important note : the purpose of the dsb investigation is not seeking answer to the question whodunnit . 
  [ how so . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2firh4/not_the_onion_russia_plans_to_sue_ukraine_for_1/ck9s26w ), 
   but if i get it right - a dutch authority is investigating the cause of the plane crash and will publish results regarding future accident prevention , basically , yes . 
   another dutch authority ( a dutch court ) will decide who murdered 298 people . 
  in due time , probably there will be a court case . 
  currently there is an ongoing * investigation * by the dutch prosecutor office of suspected 298 murders . 
  and they are not the only judicial authority investigating the murders . 
   so after all , some dutch will tell us who it was ? 
  if the dutch prosecutor office is able to determine the likely suspect ( s ) for those 298 murders , and is able to bring the case to the court . 
   i dont know why he is downvoted , the dutch have the blackbox and other things they invastigate and they will tell us who it was ... no . 
  the purpose of the investigation by the dutch safety board is not to determine whodunnit . 
  it is an aircraft accident investigation conducted as per the icao procedures . 
  according to the dutch investigation board the preliminary report will be published tuesday 9 september 2014 08:00 hours utc : http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014 the available data related to the investigation has been given to the parties participating to the investigation - such as the contents of the black boxes , and the atc recordings . 
  the data is confidential and will not be published . 
  nothing exceptional in that as they never are . 
  publishing it would be in breach of the agreed upon code of conduct as defined in [ the icao annex 13 - incident reporting , data systems and information exchange ] ( http://www.icao.int/safety/ism/icao%20annexes/forms/allitems.aspx ) . 
  the * results * of the investigation will be published , and the preliminary report is expected early september . 
  it is common for the investigation to take its time until the final report is ready . 
  sometimes that may take even years . 
  the icao recommendation is :  6.6 recommendation . -- the state conducting the investigation should release the final report in the shortest possible time and , if possible , within twelve months of the date of the occurrence . 
  if the report can not be released within twelve months , the state conducting the investigation should release an interim report on each anniversary of the occurrence , detailing the progress of the investigation and any safety issues raised .
