  before that there had been years of public discussion about the membership , about the negotiations and all the technical details . 
  and in the referendum i voted for the membership as it seemed the obvious rational choise to me . 
  only when seeing that film did i understand what the membership means deep down , what it actually stands for . 
  and i remember sitting in the theatre simply awestruck by [ this scene with the famous portuguese ensemble madredeus of which i had never heard of before . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv_fwpuopvo ) there i was sitting in the movie theatre with the sudden realization that we have just entered a union with these people . 
  not only economic , not only political , but more than that . 
  a union in which i can go and meet even live with them any day i want , and they can do that too . 
  as bros. . and that it is actually a privilege to be able to enter such union . 
  and realizing that brought tears in my eyes . 
  so , thank you portugal for making me see that . 
  ^ ( yeah , i guess wim wenders had his finger in it , but who cares ), 
  what kind of ideas you have in mind ? 
  having big wild birds of pray joining the game = good for the sport !, 
  but as far as the finnish national football team goes it will take at least a generation until we might even have the potential to become any kind of contenders on the european level . 
  we have had our trailblazers in jari litmanen and sami hyypi\u00e4 as international stars . 
  but it will take time and dedicated work for that seed to properly root and to have more juniors inspired by them to be able to follow their footsteps . 
  just as it took a long time in finnish ice-hockey : without the finnish trailblazers becoming stars in the nhl , guys like matti hagman in 1976-1982 and jari kurri in 1980 -- 1998 , there would never have been superstar teemu sel\u00e4nne [ < 3 ] . 
  and now we have a constant stream of talented finnish hockey players moving up to the toughest league on the planet , and finns have even gained a reputation for being the best goalies over there . 
  and that development has been accompanied by having new kids , new talent playing the game , more junior programs , better games , and bigger audiences in the national league . 
  and as a result the national hockey team of a small country has become a serious contender internationally . 
  i mean , in the '80s i would have never belived that sweden shoud ever fear us . 
  boy , was i wrong : now they not only fear but hate * the lions * ( the name of the finnish national hockey team ) . 
  and of course i use the word hate in a sense of brotherly rivalry as deep down we actually love one other in sometimes not so obvious ways and that would be gay anyway so stop asking me about that . 
  but jari litmanen and sami hyypi\u00e4 wo n't solve it all . 
  they 're the inspiration . 
  we also need to have more popularity for football in finland : bigger audiences for league games , bigger fanbases , bigger games , bigger junior programs with more dedicated junior players perhaps inspired by the pioneers . 
  all that will take time . 
  and as it is the most popular games by attendance in finland are ice-hockey and our own obscure , much faster version of baseball ( and , incidentally finnish baseball players have suddenly caught the attention of some american scouts , wsj : [ what finland can teach america about baseball ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-finland-can-teach-america-about-baseball-1436453947 ) ) . 
  albeit it does n't mean beer , * ollut * is finnish too . 
  it 's the [ active 2nd participle ] ( http://thefinnishteacher.weebly.com/aktiivin-2-partisiippi--the-active-2nd-participle.html ) of the verb * olla * ( to be ) , and it means ` to have been ' . 
  olut on ollut siell\u00e4 - the beer has been there ( the sentence would make little sense unless we already know what specific beer it is we are talking about ) . 
  checksum error : vowel mismatch . 
  offending letter ` a ' . 
  word not finnish . 
  yup , finnish words have inbuilt checksums , or as linguists call it [ vowel harmony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony#uralic_languages ) . 
  a word with a front vowel ( ` y ' ) in the first syllable can include a neutral vowel ( ` i ' ) but not a back vowel ( ` a ' ) in later syllables . 
  if the back vowel ` a ' is replaced with a front vowel ' \u00e4 ' that word instantly becomes proper finnish * hyppi\u00e4 * ( verb , 1st infinitive , to do jumping ) . 
  but obviously you did n't mean jumping but referred to the beloved finnish football player * sami hyypi\u00e4 * . 
  in baltic finnic languages * hyypi\u00e4 * is an ancient name for [ the eurasian eagle-owl ( * bubo bubo * ) ] ( http://www.onevision.fi/archive/website2008/editorial/03.jpg ) pictured here in its natural habitat at the helsinki olympic stadium guarding the post during the finland vs. belgium game june 2007 , and of course [ participating in the defence . 
  ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/juttububimp_503_uu.jpg ) yet we do n't call them by their ancient forgotten name , in fact only few finns know what * hyypi\u00e4 * even means . 
  finns use a more descriptive name * huuhkaja * , and if you have ever heard the big bird of the night ( the largest owl in europe ) you 'll understand the onomatopoeia . 
  but i digress . 
  back to important : the game was suspended for ten minutes . 
  soon after the owl 's appearance finland took a 1-0 lead and finland won the game 2-0 . 
  \\ o / it should go without saying that after the game the owl was hailed as a national hero . 
  that was his first public appearance , and everybody agreed that having a wild giant bird of pray participating in a football game was an awesome thing to see . 
  [ check out this short clip of the game and hear the awestruck fans chanting `` huuhkaja ! '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkmlbmr6s1e ) . 
  and if you like football and birds of pray here 's the full video of his debut in the live broadcast : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ad8iu7aji earlier there had been numerous sightings during the winter and spring , and people had claimed to have heard the big bird during the night in the neighbourhood ( * `` but i fucking swear it , at 4 am as i was heading home from a bar i heard an owl loudly howling in the city center . 
  and i mean loud . 
  seriously . '' * ) . 
  after his big public debut on a live broadcast there was no room for doubt , the big guy had moved in , called the stadium his home , and he became instantly famous . 
  then the big question was how to call him . 
  now that you and i both know what * hyypi\u00e4 * means it may sound like an obvious choise to call him sami after our beloved sami hyypi\u00e4 . 
  but , as i said , generally finns do not know what the ancient word * hyypi\u00e4 * means and instead everyone knows the bird as * huuhkaja * . 
  so , he was called bubi in honor of bror-erik `` bubi '' wallenius , a legendary finnish football announcer , because bubi liked to hang around the announcers ' stand and because the bird 's scientific name is * bubo bubo * . 
  the chant gained a life of its own , bubi became an unofficial mascot of the national football team , and the finnish national football team quickly got a new nickname * huuhkajat * ( plural , the eurasian eagle-owls ) . 
  and here 's [ a november 2007 thread on the finnish football fan forum ] ( http://futisforum2.org/index.php?phpsessid=clqa1te1k8gcf62f1ph34tguc4&amp;topic=40956.0 ) where it was overwhelmingly decided that from here to eternity the finnish national football team shall be known as * huuhkajat * . 
  and that is why you often see a * huuhkaja * associated with the finnish national football team and its fans . 
  [ and bubi lives on . 
  ] ( http://payload200.cargocollective.com/1/6/215392/6305770/_e8a5475_900.jpg ) so what became of bubi ? 
  he was chosen as the helsinki citizen of the year 2007 , and to everyone 's amazement he actually attended the ceremony held for his honor in december 2007 . 
  but we do n't actually know much about his life . 
  he probably grew up in the countryside , and then moved into city . 
  there are prospects for hunting successfully in a city , and in a stadium there 's probably pray foraging on the food dropped by the audience . 
  afaik no-one ever saw bubi with a mate , but it is possible he had a family just a stone throw away in the central park forest , and the stadium was his hunting grounds . 
  but life in city is not without dangers and i do n't know when bubi was last seen ( probably years ago by now ? ) . 
  after bubi we have had more * huuhkajas * moving in to the city center , and we have also witnessed a pair [ nesting and bringing up kids right at the heart of the city on a roof of a department store . 
  ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/1920/1288375737532.jpg ) perhaps bubi was the father of one of the parents ? 
  we do n't know . 
  but what we do know is [ we 'll never forget bubi . 
  ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2954657132_2cb2a9c247_m.jpg ) and , in addition to loving football , that right there is another commonality between bubi and his namesake sami hyypi\u00e4 . 
  they both were pioneers and trailblazers on their own fields . 
  sami as a finnish professional footballer , and bubi as a bird of pray . 
   what is lutheranism 's role in finnish society ? 
  the lutheran church is by far the largest religious community in finland with almost 75 % of population as members . 
  in a sense the lutheran church is also a state church but in some senses it is not . 
  the lutheran church has ( as does the finnish orthodox church ) a special status under the law , and they govern themselves with their own ` church-law ' , changes of which the parliament can only accept or decline , not propose . 
  the church also carries a tax from its members - a service the state provides to it but with a fee . 
  despite the high membership rate finns are not that religious . 
  in a 2011 poll among finns : 27 % said to belive in christian god , 23 % believed there 's a god but not as the church teaches , 17 % was unsure , 7 % doubted , and 21 % did not believe in the existence of a god . 
  so , most are members out of habit not conviction . 
  but lutheranism goes far deeper than merely believing or not beliving in god . 
  it is deep in the fabric of the society past and present and has been molding us and the way we think even about the ordinary matters ( such as work , having rules , paying taxes etc ) . 
  living inside it we just do n't easily recognize it all , and i 'm not the best person to ask about that . 
   why is the lutheran church of finland so liberal ? 
  i do n't think it 's particularly liberal - more like adaptive . 
  they are not the fist ones to promote changes in society but often follow when others have already brought the change about to happen . 
  democracy has a role there : as the church leaders are elected over time they will reflect the changes in society . 
  and the finnish lutheran church has also been emphasizing tolerance as one of the important teachings of jesus . 
   why are there no nuns or monks in lutheranism ? 
  to put it other way : why would there be ? 
  what would they be doing ? 
  other than living in isolation i can not see much role for nuns or monks in modern society . 
  yet there are historical reasons for the lack of monasteries , nuns and monks . 
  martin luther was opposed to monasticism as were the other reformers . 
  which gave an incentive for rulers to embrace the reform and then proceed to confiscate the wealths of the monasteries . 
  in medieval times when finland ( then part of sweden ) was still catholic there were monasteries and such over here . 
  they had been established after 12th century when finland got crusaded . 
  all changed when the swedish king gustav wasa started the reformation in 1527 . 
  over time the wealths of churches and monasteries got confiscated by the state , and the monasteries were closed .
