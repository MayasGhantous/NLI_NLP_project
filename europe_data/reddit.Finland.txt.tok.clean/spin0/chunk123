  all i can think of such recklessness is that it was part their misguided game theory , i have no other explanation for willingly entering such disaster . 
  well , i never understood the southern european left in the first place . 
  i mean , still having communist parties in the parliament ? 
  how the fuck is that even possible ? 
  who the hell in their sane mind would run such party never mind vote for them ? 
  i have sometimes voted left in the finnish national election depending on their platform . 
  but i have * never * voted left in the eu parliament election because then the more moderate finnish left parties would form ep parliamentary groups with the idiot radical leftist parties from south europe . 
  and the more i have learned about them the less power for them the better . 
  i mean it 's 2015 and suddenly communists ? 
  marxists ? 
  seriously ? 
  how retarted you have to be to be a maoist in the first place never mind in 2015 ? 
  it 's simply amazing . 
  until the european left can openly distance from the radicals and come up with better ideas i will firmly vote right in the ep elections , while i may vote left in the national elections . 
  and it 's not my fucking fault . 
  it 's the european left that should be more careful who they are grouping with . 
   the greek pm is trying to get that offer he walked away with passed by parliament , right ? 
  that is not the third bailout deal . 
  those are the * prior actions * , mostly stuff that greece had agreed to in the previous two bailouts but not actually implemented , added with the additional condition to roll back the unilatelar actions greece did breaking its agreement in february when it promised not to do such things at all . 
  trust towards greece is about zero , and when those prior actions are implemented that will make greece eligible for opening negotiation for a third bailout . 
  only then there will be negotiations for the terms and details of that esm bailout itself . 
  that will take weeks to months . 
   that could fail or it gets approved but then the imf wo n't go along with the bailout . 
  no , the imf involment does not depend on this . 
  and certainly the imf will attend the negotiations for the third bailout after they have been opened . 
  so , eventually the imf involment will depend on the terms of the esm bailout which will be negotiated in the coming weeks . 
  it is no secret that the imf has little patience left for greece and has even been keen on leaving altogether . 
  in diplomatic terms the new greek government has treated the imf with open hostility this year , and in january the first thing v-man did was this : [ greece 's finance minister vows to shun officials from troika ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/30/greece-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-shun-officials-troika )  yanis varoufakis says new government will refuse to engage with auditors from the eu , the european central bank and the international monetary fund . 
  everyone knows greece will need debt restructuring , especially after the past wasted six months which have only caused damage to the greek economy . 
  since 2012 the institutions , including the imf , have been saying : * reforms first , then we can discuss debt restructuring * . 
  they have acknowledged the need of it years ago . 
  but you wo n't do any restructuring with a partner that has refused to adhere to its previous commitments while asking for more money . 
  and the line of the institutions is remains the same . 
  therefore it 's vital for greece to finally implement the prior actions . 
  the big problem here is : * why would anyone borrow money to someone simultaneoulsy asking for both debt relief and new loans ? 
  * i know i would n't . 
  and i know i 'm not alone in that . 
  pretty much common sense . 
  and most importantly : * the ecb would not . 
  * introduce debt relief now and you can say goodbye to ela for some time . 
  the ecb has their rules . 
  which takes us back to one of the last interviews while v-man still was the finance minister where he stated that his plan is based on the institutions breaking their rules for his advantage . 
  he proclaimed that the capital controls could be lifted like next tuesday because the ecb would break its rules and simply send more money . 
  i do n't know where he got that theory but someone should have told him it was wrong from the start . 
   in the meantime , are n't greek cash reserves dangerously low ? 
  how long can greece go without some sort of infusion before the atms are basically tapped ? 
  not for long . 
  probably matter of days now , not weeks . 
  so , the high priority issue for the eurogroup ( and ecofin ) is to look at bridge financing for greece to carry the country through the summer until the first trench of the possible third bailout is available ( ** if ** it materializes ) . 
  the absolute minimum greece will need is $ 7bn by 20 july and $ 5bn by mid august but they 'll need more on top of that . 
  unclear how much . 
  and even getting the bridge financing is not certain . 
  negotiating and arranging it will probably take some time , and it will likely come with strict conditions attached to it . 
  expect some tough negotiations for it . 
  and where would the bridge money come from ? 
  that takes us back to the expired second bailout program from the efsf . 
  contrary to many redditor 's beliefs the creditors did not make huge profits on those loans . 
  no , the profits were actually paid back to greece and for that there were mechanisms established . 
  as the second bailout program expired at the end of the june also those mechanisms expired . 
  but they still have some previously accumulated funds which would have been given to greece if the program had continued as planned . 
  afaik there 's about $ 3.3 bn in ecb , $ 1.85 bn in esm , and about $ 1.5 bn by ez governments . 
  my numbers could be off , but you get the idea . 
  eleasing those funds to greece could be a quick process without the need of going through the national parliaments but it needs an unanimous decision by the eurogroup . 
  ** if ** such unanimous decision is guarateed , and expect strict conditions attached to it , then there 's at least one part of the bridge financing for greece . 
  but to take greece through the summer will likely need more . 
  bilateral loans from some ez countries ? 
  passing the hat among the eu countries ? 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  seems that neither has the eurogroup nor the ecofin . 
  one thing is certain : the ecb can not and will not rise the ela limit until there 's certainty of either bridge financing or a deal for the third bailout . 
  before that the greek banks will remain closed . 
  and in any event it will take long time ( months to years ) until greece can fully lift the capital controls it has imposed . 
  what i do n't get in this saga is why some still hail v-man as a great thinker . 
  i mean , with his game theory he took his country from budding growth to capital controls in mere five months . 
  in the class of rare achievements that is in class of its own . 
  any random persom from street would have fared better as a finance minister by doing absolutely nothing at all . 
  hell , even a roll of tape or a paperweight would have fared better . 
   so process-wise , where does that leave greece and the euro group ? 
  next up process-wise : 1 . 
  the prior actions agreed last weekend . 
  greece has to implement those to be eligible for a third bailout . 
  needs to get accepted by the greek parliament and other countries too . 
  will get back at least some of the lost trust on greece . 
  bridge financing . 
  a tough nut to crack . 
  will take days to weeks . 
  still unclear how and where that money would come from . 
  additionally , trust towards greece is pretty much zero after the past six months . 
  there will probably be some kind of interim financing for the next couple of weeks until they figure out how to get the financing for the next months before the third bailout materializers ( ** if ** it will ) . 
  negotiations for the third bailout from the esm . 
  an even tougher nut to crack . 
  will take weeks to months . 
  how to include even further debt relief ( greece has already had debt relief several times ) while giving more loans ? 
  how to facilitate it within the existing mechanisms ? 
  and even more importantly how to use those existing mechanisms without introducing further liabilities on the eu citizens ? 
  because people are pretty pissed and wo n't easily accept further putting their wallets on the line for greece once more . 
  important thing to remember . 
  first and foremost greece is our friend and partner . 
  a prosperous greece is in everyone 's interest . 
  i 've heard many insane conspiracy theories about how everyone else is out to destroy greece bacause whatever reasons .
