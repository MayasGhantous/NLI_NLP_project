  but the reality is very simple : everyone in the ez and in the eu would prefer a prosperous greece to a ruined one ( except perhaps some in the minority of far-right and far-left ) . 
  i estimate five years as five years . 
  and it is obvious that restructuring those debts now would have no effect on greece 's current problems servicing its debts . 
  as you can easily see there are other loans with more pressing repayment schedules . 
  and to add to that : * what debt there is to restructure in the first place ? 
  * here 's greece 's repayment profile : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rkoxk2q.png ) the bilateral loans from the ez governments ( the first bailout ) start having repayments only in 2020 . 
  and the second bailout loans through the efsf only in 2022 . 
  and even as those loans already have very low interest rates the profits are given back to greece . 
  so those loans are hardly the reason for greece 's problems servicing its debts , and restructuring them now is not the solution either . 
  it is obvious the immediate problem are the repayments to the imf , the ecb and the t-bill holders ( mostly greek banks ) . 
  of those : * the imf , while supporting debt restructuring , will not restructure its loans . 
  * the ecb is bound by its rules and will not restructure its loans . 
  * that leaves only the t-bill owners . 
  then the greek banks and by extension the greek savings would be fucked . 
  so , perhaps those proposing that the four biggest banks in greece should be merged to only two are onto something : [ exclusive : greek banks face closures , bailout or not - sources ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/08/us-eurozone-greece-bankclosures-iduskcn0pi2ki20150708 ), 
  a very good concise summary of the main points , thanks for posting . 
   is there any kind of list what measures were taken ? 
  to my knowledge there are no simple short lists available . 
  reliable ones that is . 
  the best , and pretty much the only way to make sense on what has been demanded and what greece has actually done is to read the relevant reports . 
  unfortunately that involves reading/browsing through hundreds of pages , or even several thousands as i have done during the last five years . 
  but you could try reading the summaries of the documents to get at least some sense . 
  a very good source are the second economic adjustment programme for greece review reports . 
  they include the reforms that greece agreed to do as part of the second bailout program and the reforms they actually made . 
  [ first review , 2012 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2012/pdf/ocp123_en.pdf ) [ second review , 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2013/pdf/ocp148_en.pdf ) [ third review , 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2013/pdf/ocp159_en.pdf ) [ fourth review , 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2014/pdf/ocp192_en.pdf ) another very good source are the relevant imf [ documents on the imf site ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/country/grc/index.htm?type=9998 ) , which has the relevant staff reports , program reviews , memorandums of understanding , letters of intent , and article iv consultations . 
  here 's the most recent program review : [ greece : fifth review under the extended arrangement under the extended fund facility , and request for waiver of nonobservance of performance criterion and rephasing of access ; staff report ; press release ; and statement by the executive director for greece ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41614.0 )  summary : this paper discusses greece 's fifth review under the extended arrangement under the extended fund facility ( eff ) , and request for waiver of nonobservance of performance criterion and rephasing of access . 
  greece has gone from having the weakest to the strongest cyclically adjusted fiscal position within the euro area in just four years . 
  but more fiscal adjustment is needed to restore debt sustainability . 
  structural reforms are progressing , although unevenly . 
  the redoubling of efforts to liberalize products and service markets are much welcomed . 
  on the basis of reforms undertaken in the context of this review , and the government 's policy commitments going forward , the imf staff supports the completion of the fifth review . 
  and a relevant article iv consultation paper : [ greece : 2013 article iv consultation ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=40637.0 )  summary : fiscal expansion after euro accession led to a buildup of large economic imbalances , and a program to make fiscal policy and the fiscal and debt position sustainable was initiated . 
  however , the program saw opposition from the outset and structural reforms stalled , which unsettled the investment climate . 
  the greek government 's determination to push ahead with reforms has seen progress in fiscal adjustment and perseverance of the financial sector . 
  however , the social cost of the recession has been very high , and the current program can only succeed if policymakers address the root causes . 
  yeah looks like they already moved on other things the nobelists said nothing new that we have n't heard before, 
  according to the guardian the uk chancellor george osborne shot this silly idea down : http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/13/greek-crisis-tsipras-battle-bailout-deal-backlash-live#block-55a40bb7e4b0710add775023  however , uk chancellor george osborne immediately rejected the idea , according to treasury officials who said that brussels was told the # 1bn of uk funds in the european financial stabilisation mechanism should not be used for eurozone bailouts , in accordance with a 2010 agreement . 
  bloomberg tv is about to have two nobel laureates paul kruman and edmund phelps to discuss greece . 
  bound to be interesting . 
  i guess this has the stream : http://www.bloomberg.com/live/europe . . or google for an alternate one . 
  a relevant excerpt from the recent [ imf debt sustainability analysis ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15165.pdf ) :  the projected privatization proceeds under the program were $ 23 billion over the 2014 -- 22 period . 
  half of these proceeds were to come from privatizing state holdings of the banking sector . 
  however , given the very high and rising levels of nonperforming loans in the banking system that in turn will require setting aside the bank recapitalization buffer as a potential backstop , it is highly unlikely that these proceeds will materialize . 
  of the remainder , the authorities have provided only vague commitments and have stated their opposition to further privatization of key assets . 
  against this background and given the very poor performance to date of cumulative privatization proceeds of only about $ 3 billion over the last 5 years , it is prudent and timely to take a more realistic view of how much privatization proceeds can materialize ( box 1 and text figure ) . 
  and that is what i 've been wondering too . 
  i do n't think there 's a detailed list yet . 
  the deal says `` to develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance '' , so i 'd assume establishing the list would be part of the development . 
  but it 's probably pretty similar to the previous list of $ 50 bn privatizations to which greece agreed to years ago but never implemented . 
  i think it 's relevant to note that the agreement is just the prior actions that will form the basis to open the actual esm bailout negotiations . 
  the parliament will not vote on this . 
  the decision to accept the deal will be made by the parliamentary grand committee before the end of the week . 
  and timo soini has stated it would be crazy to leave the government over this . 
  i think it 's likely the deal will get accepted . 
  right , at the end of the day the value is what the market is willing to pay . 
  and having at least some stability in politics , policies and economy certainly helps in that making the investors more willing to invest more . 
  nothing stange about that as the imf is only discussing a subset of projected privatizations in that sentence ( `` the politically less sensitive privatizations '' ) and annual proceeds not total value . 
  you probably skipped the part right before where the imf report says : * `` the projected privatization proceeds under the program were $ 23 billion over the 2014 -- 22 period . 
  '' * and the first question is if there are assets to reach a target of $ 50 bn . 
  so far the cumulative privatization proceeds over the last five years have been abysmal partly because there has been so little done . 
   generate over the life of the new loan a targeted total of eur 50bn the first question is if there actually is assets to fulfill that target value . 
  finnish finance minister alexander stubb interviewed on bloomberg about the agreement and the prospects of bridge financing : [ greek bridge financing still an open question : stubb ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-07-13/greek-bridge-financing-still-an-open-question-stubb ), 
  remember , last night 's result can be described as tentative . 
  a lot needs to happen for it to hold . 
  does not mean risk of grexit is a thing of the past . 
  furthermore , this is not the deal for a third bailout . 
  these are the prior actions when implemented will make greece eligible for a third bailout * to open * the esm negotiation . 
  and last night 's result has to be accepted by national parliements . 
  then there will be long negotiations for the terms and details of the esm bailout itself . 
  as merrill lynch analyst ruben segura-cayuel puts it :  we argued last week that likely grexit would be avoided this weekend . 
  and at this time ... it looks like it will be avoided , but the days ahead are full of opportunities for it to materialise . 
  we remain in the path of grexit and everything needs to go perfect to avoid it . 
  we likely need a cabinet reshuffle in greece . 
  then the greek government needs to pass seven packages before wednesday just to open the door to start negotiations for a new programme . 
  it also needs to propose more reforms in several fronts . 
  after all this happens , then talks about a new ( third ) package can start , assuming other national parliaments agree to do so ...  we still think there is room for a positive resolution , but even the best case scenario is a deal with many conditions and very gradual disbursements , which will have substantial implementation risks because of no ownership . 
  the next high priority issue for the eurogroup is to look at bridge financing for greece to carry the country through the summer until the first trench of the possible third bailout is available ( * if * it materializes ) . 
  the absolute minimum greece will need is $ 7bn by 20 july and $ 5bn by mid august but they 'll need more on top of that . 
  unclear how much . 
  and even getting the bridge financing is not certain . 
  negotiating and arranging it will probably take some time , and it will likely come with strict conditions attached to it . 
  expect some tough negotiations for it . 
  and where would the bridge money come from ? 
  that takes us back to the expired second bailout program from the efsf . 
  contrary to many redditor 's beliefs the creditors did not make huge profits on those loans . 
  no , the profits were actually paid back to greece and for that there were mechanisms established . 
  as the second bailout program expired at the end of the june also those mechanisms expired . 
  but they still have some previously accumulated funds which would have been given to greece if the program had continued as planned . 
  afaik there 's about $ 3.3 bn in ecb , $ 1.85 bn in esm , and about $ 1.5 bn by ez governments . 
  my numbers could be off , but you get the idea . 
  releasing those funds to greece could be a quick process without the need of going through the national parliaments but it needs an * unanimous decision * by the eurogroup . 
  ** if ** such unanimous decision is guarateed , and expect strict conditions attached to it , then there 's at least one part of the bridge financing for greece . 
  but to take greece through the summer will likely need more . 
  bilateral loans from some ez countries ? 
  passing the hat among the eu countries ? 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  a relevant recently published book by journalist and former wsj correspondent james angelos : [ the full catastrophe : travels among the new greek ruins ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-full-catastrophe-travels-among/dp/0385346484 ) nyt review : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/books/review/full-catastrophe-about-greek-economy-review.html another : http://www.bostonnewstime.com/regional/110277-james-angelos-book-reveals-how-greece-cheated-itself-to-ruin-amid-bailout-talks.html  it was the rumours of an ` island of the blind ' which first bought angelos , a journalist , to greece in 2011 . 
  he had heard that on zakynthos , something like two per cent of the population was registered blind . 
   only , they were n't : indeed , it would later transpire 61 of the 680 ` blind ' residents were quite happily driving around the island . 
  but being ` blind ' had its advantages - in particular , the $ 724 paid in benefits once every two months , and a reduction in their utility bills .
