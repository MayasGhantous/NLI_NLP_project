   only , of course , 498 of the 680 blind residents of zakynthos were not blind , or even partially sighted . 
  it was a scam which could be traced back to one ophthalmologist and one official , which was estimated to have cost the country $ 9 million . 
  and , as angelos discovered , it was only the tip of the iceberg . 
   ...  when the government chose to take a closer look at who they were paying pensions to , they found a slightly suspicious 8,500 pensioners had surpassed the milestone age of 100 . 
  an even closer look revealed , 40,000 pension claims were fraudulent . 
  it seems people were forgetting to register their loved ones ' deaths . 
  go home ussr , you 're drunk . 
   the wounds of war were only healed in the 1980s , as the socialist party ( pasok ) won power and the country joined the european union . 
  its leader , andreas papandreou , remained highly confrontational and embarked on a programme of public spending and of hiring his supporters to public sector jobs , to redress `` historic injustices '' . 
  [ as this graph demonstrates ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ixs448g.png ) but it 's not like the greeks were completely oblivious for decades . 
  through the years they did have outspoken politicians who warned that the greek system was not sustainable and must be reformed . 
  unfortunately their warnings were met with hostility and such politicians got marginalized : [ the politicians who warned greece -- but were ignored - lawmakers ' proposals were savaged by media and labor unions ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-greek-politicians-who-flagged-structural-problemsbut-were-ignored-1436612782 )  a note from greece 's finance minister to his prime minister warned that the country needed tough economic overhauls if its economy was to live up to its european aspirations . 
   `` we can take on the task to truly lead the country to a european direction , on condition that the greeks -- those who are living well , not those who are suffering -- will make the necessary sacrifices , '' the finance minister wrote . 
   that was in september 1996 . 
  the finance minister was alekos papadopoulos and the prime minister was konstantinos simitis , but the letter could have been written today . 
  faz recently published a short history of the clientelism in greece . 
  even with machine translation it 's a very good read : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cj3wk/faz_a_chronicle_of_a_disaster_7_page_german/, 
   your statement was that greece did n't do the reforms as agreed . 
  that statement is correct . 
  greece has n't implemented all the reforms they have commited to , i.e. 
  they have n't implemented them as agreed . 
  it is also true that greece has implemented numerous reforms . 
  those two statements are not contradictory . 
  had greece implemented reforms as agreed greece would n't now be negotiating about implementing those very reforms it previously has agreed to implement asking for more money for implementing them . 
  if you 're interested to see which reforms greece has successfully implemeted and which ones have been lacking the relevant imf documents are most informative source : http://www.imf.org/external/country/grc/index.htm?type=9998, 
  then a political scandal in finland 's exit gets revealed -  fixitgate . 
  outside the ez . 
   hope this weekend sees it largely wrapped up . 
  this is just the start . 
  this weekend greece 's application for an esm bailout probably gets accepted . 
  if so , prepare for weeks to months of negotiations between greece and institutions , and governments trying to appeal to their respective parliaments to accept the bailout and the terms . 
  also debt restructuring , lifting/not lifting the capital controls and other exciting shit coming . 
  stay tuned . 
  the interest rates are very low . 
  additionally the profits from the loans , both the ecb and the efsf loans by the ez , are given back to greece . 
   so far all the money for greece has n't come out of taxpayers ' pockets yet but rather as guarantees for bank loans . 
  that applies to the second bailout program with the purposefully founded efsf as the mechanism with the loans guaranteed by the ez countries . 
  but under the first bailout the ez countries lended greece $ 52.9 bn as bilateral loans . 
  it 's an interesting read but please do n't editorialize the titles as it 's in breach of the rules . 
  such as spilled drinks and failing to order before the last call . 
  in the year 2022 . 
   if you have a german flag in other time than football wm some lynchmob will come and burn your house . 
   your figures are wrong . 
   uk 's deficit was not 8 % , but 11.6 % in 2009 . 
  if you read your link it only discusses the net borrowing : * `` the # 163.4 bn borrowed is equivalent to 11.6 % of gdp '' * . 
  that is not uk 's structural deficit but headline deficit which includes the cyclical deficit ( and investments ) . 
  the related blogpost by the imf chief economist olivier blanchard is also well worth reading : [ greece : past critiques and the path forward ] ( http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/07/09/greece-past-critiques-and-the-path-forward/ ), 
  which means it 's the efsf loans from the second bailout . 
  that makes sense as there is n't much that could be restructured before that : [ graph ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rkoxk2q.png ), 
  did n't take long , though : [ greek proposals leak !, 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/09/greek-crisis-reform-plan-grexit-tsipras-draghi-live#block-559eee28e4b05111b75595cf ), 
  looks like there 's a glitch : [ @spiegelpeter ] ( https://twitter.com/spiegelpeter/status/619236588162301952 ) \\ #eurozone authorities say they have received the \\ #greece economic reform proposal @martinselmayr . 
  @spiegelpeter not yet . 
  @spiegelpeter well , others say they 've received it ... [ @martinselmayr ] ( https://twitter.com/martinselmayr/status/619241992241856512 ) signed letters are needed . 
  edit : fixed . 
  [ @martinselmayr 3 min ] ( https://twitter.com/martinselmayr/status/619251843206643712 ) now received . 
  signed . 
  three institutions will now assess . 
  \\ #withjuncker and now i 'm not sure which signature he meant in the first place - by the greeks or by juncker ? 
  i guess it was actually the latter as the letters needed to be signed by juncker before they could be sent forward to the relevant '' \\ #eurozone authorities '' . 
   this is precisely the problem . 
  it 's not a problem , it is a feature , and was an important reason the currency union was formed in the first place ( first as emu , then euro ) . 
  the youngsters do n't remember the times before when it was all about currency manipulation , nor the long process of when , how and why emu and then euro was formed . 
  but older generations remember the times before the emu and euro when european countries fought against one other with competitive devaluations in a race to the bottom . 
  here 's for example frence 's historic inflation rate : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=frcpiyoy&amp;d1=19580101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600&amp;ref=/france/inflation-cpi, 
  no , i 'm not talking about * you * . 
  my comment was not `` about the messenger '' at all . 
  it was solely about the editorialised title . 
  which , as you should know , is a breach of rules of posting . 
   what is your point of view ? 
  well , my pov is that you should not post deliberately editorialised titles . 
  meanwhile the oil prices remain volatile and have fallen back to levels last seen in march . 
   i hope this changes . 
  we need to learn to work together , particularly when problems arise . 
  me too , my friend , me too . 
  as do pretty much everyone else . 
  we do need to work on the integration part to have a stronger monetary union . 
   do you have a list of the countries said no ? 
  do i wish i had . 
  but more importantly we have to remember that eventually they all agreed to it . 
  so playing the blame game with such a list would be pretty lame . 
  that 's water under the bridge and we have to look at the present , how to best solve the current crisis , and the future - what do we make of it as partners . 
  and most importantly , also greece is our partner and friend . 
   is it possible to get funds from the esm and ` repay ' the imf ? 
  we have to keep in mind that any money from the esm is weeks or even months away in any case . 
  it 's not a simple tap that opens quickly even if there was a deal already by the next weekend . 
  and that is the reason greece needs bridge financing to take it past this month and the summer . 
  that will have to come from some other sources , and scraping that together is another challenge . 
  which takes us back to the expired second bailout program . 
  contrary to many redditor 's beliefs the creditors did not make huge profits on those loans . 
  no , the profits were actually paid back to greece and for that there was mechanisms established . 
  as the second bailout program expired at the end of the june also those mechanisms expired . 
  yet those mechanisms still have some previously accumulated funds which would have been given to greece if the program had continued as planned . 
  afaik there 's about $ 3.3 bn in ecb , $ 1.85 bn in esm , and about $ 1.5 bn by ez governments . 
  my numbers could be off , but you get the idea : releasing those funds to greece could be a quick process without the need of going through the national parliaments - it needs an unanimous decision by the eurogroup though . 
  if such unanimous decision is guarateed then there we have at least one big part of the bridge over troubled summer for greece . 
  but to take greece through the summer will likely need more . 
  bilateral loans from some ez countries ? 
  passing the hat among the eu countries ? 
  i have absolutely no idea .
