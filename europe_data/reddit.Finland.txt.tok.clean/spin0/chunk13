  so , do not expect ( or as russia has done , demand ) for the black box or atc recordings to get published . 
  they never are . 
  sometimes only relevant snippets of those have been published as text - not the recordings themselves . 
  and those snippets have been published with the results in due time . 
  in some rare cases some snippets may have been leaked before the results , but that is very rare and as a breach of code of conduct may compromise the investigation . 
  it is important to keep in mind what the dutch safety board is investigating and what is the purpose of its investigation ( or actually [ the three investigations ] ( http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014 ) they have opened ) . 
  as per icao annex 13 the purpose of the investigation is :  a process conducted for the purpose of accident prevention which includes the gathering and analysis of information , the drawing of conclusions , including the determination of causes and , when appropriate , the making of safety recommendations . 
  ** apportioning blame , such as who shot the missile , is not the purpose of the dsb investigation : **  3.1 the sole objective of the investigation of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and incidents . 
  it is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame or liability . 
   . .  5.4.1 recommendation . -- any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability should be separate from any investigation conducted under the provisions of this annex . 
  for that purpose there is separate judicial criminal investigations by dutch prosecutor office , by ukrainian prosecutor , and by other relevant judicial authorities too . 
  therefore , do not expect the mh17 accident investigation report , preliminary or final , to contain much anything regarding whodunnit . 
  the whodunnit investigations are separate and handled by the appropriate judicial authorities . 
  for example , the dutch prosecutor office has opened an investigation for suspected 298 murders . 
   a ) having control over its own currency which , among with the related stupid policies , was also one of the factors behind the recession and the severity of it in the first place . 
  a big mistake was the one-eyed policy of keeping the currency finnish markka strong - it had become a harmful mantra during the 80 's and culminated in early 90 's . 
  the interest rates were soaring because the fiscal policy was aimed to defend the `` strong '' fim at any cost . 
  high interest rates hurt businesses that had borrowed funding for their investements in previous years of economic boom . 
  and despite of all the promises of keeping fim `` strong '' devaluation was eventually inevitable . 
  in 1991 all promises were broken with a devaluation and later floating the fim in 1992 . 
  and that really really hurt the businesses that had taken cheap loans in foreign currencies . 
  it was a double blow for small/mid sized businesses right there . 
  an important lesson from the early '90s recession : * do not give finnish politicians such powers . 
  *  would a euro exit be at least the start of the solution ? 
  great idea . 
  let 's not learn anything from the last time , and let 's destroy small/mid sized businesses with a free falling currency again , shall we ? 
  actually nokia has been doing well after selling its phone business , and the company just made it back to the eurozone top-50 stock index : [ nokia makes a comeback in euro stoxx 50 index ] ( http://www.nokiapoweruser.com/2014/08/31/nokia-makes-a-comeback-in-euro-stoxx-50-index/ ),

  [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ), 
  fta :  `` the overall temporary restrictions currently applied by russia potentially jeopardise 5 billion euros worth of trade , '' potentially jeopardize 5 bn = / = costs europe 5 bn, 
  because we can do without natural gas was such situation to arise . 
   i also think having no strategic value helps too . 
  have you actually looked at a map . 
  and then considered as to why during the wwii the western allies , germany , and the su , and then later during the cold war both the us and the su considered the region as strategically important . 
  the us had 23 nuclear targets in finland , quite a lot for a country of less that 5 million people and without any strategic resources , and that 's the us only - how many targets the su had has been never revealed . 
   now considering the fact that finland prides itself on fighting against russia , do n't you consider the wishy washy behavior by some people and politicians that are afraid to ever say anything that could dare offend a russian to be pathetic in contrast ? 
   finland criticizing countries for wanting to be defended is crazy . 
  did you actually read the article ? 
  it actually argues ** against the former american national security adviser ** zbigniew brzezinski who has recommended ` finlandization ' for ukraine . 
  a finnish ambassador writes how he * disagrees * with those views promoted by a ** us adviser ** . 
  us adviser guy : * ukraine , you better go for that good ole finlandization . 
  * finnish ambassador guy : * well , perhaps you better not . 
  * and then you turn it around as if it was the finnish guy promoting that . 
  jerk . 
   that was still poor . 
  up and down is normal but overall finland was still poor until after soviet union split apart . 
  only if you consider countries such as austria , germany , france and uk as ` poor ' , for comparison see : http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:aut:fin:fra:deu:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false as compared to other european countries finland does not look like ` poor ' to me . 
  also it did not feel like ` poor ' when living here , but a bit ` poorer ' than other nordics such as sweden . 
   finland remained independent because no one would have any reason to want the country in the first place other than a complete ego maniac that has to control the entire world . 
  yet the soviets tried . 
  twice . 
  you do n't think the opposition the su met here had anything to do with them abandoning the idea ? 
  the next milestone is to reach 38 % renewables of total primary energy by 2020 as per the [ eu 20-20-20 targets ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/package/index_en.htm ) . 
  regarding ghg emissions finland is already below its kyoto targets - as is the eu . 
  share of renewables of total primary energy 2013 : http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ehk/2013/04/ehk_2013_04_2014-03-24_kuv_013_en_001.gif, 
  iirc there was an agreement to share it between estonia and finland . 
  anyway , imo it should be in estonia . 
   yeah , also it was pretty poor and only got more well off once the soviet union broke up : http://i.imgur.com/5y2dryj.png [ 0 ] actually the opposite happened as you can see in the graph . 
  when the su broke up finland 's gdp took a deep dive , although there were many factors to that . 
  inb4 winter is coming and everyone will freeze to death ... 
  while finland currently gets 100 % of its natural gas from russia , that gas is only about 10 % of all primary energy usage . 
  the natural gas would be replaced by other sources of energy if it was cut-off . 
  natural gas is used in some combined power plants producing electricity and district heat . 
  if the gas was suddenly cut out those powerplants would a ) switch to other sources of energy ( air-propane mix , biogas , oil , coal etc ) or b ) get compensated by other powerplants . 
  in finland there are [ existing plans ] ( http://www.huoltovarmuus.fi/static/pdf/607.pdf ) for such case to arise , and legislation requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time . 
  the [ national emergency supply agency ] ( http://www.nesa.fi/ ) is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution . 
  so basically finland * could * do without russian gas . 
  in case of sudden closure of russian gas pipes no-one would freeze here , no-one would die , steel making would not halt as it does n't use gas , but there would be some costs in switching over to other energy sources in affected power plants . 
  there are plans and proposals for a more heterogenous gas supply such as the new lng terminal with estonia , the proposed mid-nordic gas pipeline from norway through sweden to finland , the nordic gas grid and the north transgas project . 
  but all those would be years away . 
  it was widely reported in other news sources too , not only by daily mail . 
  and the source is manuel barroso . 
   in other words give up karelia/east ukraine , stay out of nato and keep doing business with one another ? 
  well , that was not the point of the article . 
  actually what the article argues ** against ** is the zbigniew brzezinski view :  the former american national security adviser , zbigniew brzezinski , has used the term to suggest that accepting russian domination is the only course ukraine can take . 
  i disagree . 
   according to la repubblica , barroso said he asked putin about the presence of russian troops in eastern ukraine . 
  nato says there are at least 1,000 russian forces on the wrong side of the border . 
  the ukrainians put the figure at 1,600 . 
   `` the problem is not this , but that if i want i 'll take kiev in two weeks , '' putin said , according to la repubblica .

   why ? 
  you do n't simply ` remove ' battle damage . 
  and there 's also no sign of overpainting ukrainian markings in the vehicles . 
  these are not captured vehicles . 
  that 's a huge convoy with 122 vehicles : tanks , apcs , trucks and support vehicles . 
  and as none of them bear the markings seen in captured ukrainian vehicles and none show any battle damage it 's highly unlikely they 're captured . 
  also the composition of the convoy points to russian russian motorized infantry perhaps a part of a brigade ( additionally the original tweet said this was only one of three such convoys ) . 
  geolocation puts it into the krasnodon region in ukraine : http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.nl/2014/09/russian-moves-huge-convoy-of-armor-into.html, 
  well , technically it was the soviet union that attacked finland in the beginning of the continuation war as june 25th 1941 the soviet union made bombing raids to helsinki , turku and about dozen other cities and towns in finland . 
  the difference was that this time the soviets had a legitimate * casus belli * : four days earlier the german lufwaffe had used finnish airspace and territory to make bombing raids against the soviet union . 
  but , as i said , technically . 
  juice rap news is a russia today project . 
  iirc after the 50,000 mark survey it was decided that surveys would happen every six months instead of subscriber milestones . 
  emphasis on the iirc part . 
   i 'm interested in the opinions of the other neutral nations in the eu regards finland and sweden 's increased involvement in nato . 
  do you feel your nations will compromise their neutrality ? 
  as a finn just pointing out that finland and sweden are not neutral and have n't been neutral since the cold war ended and joining the eu . 
  both countries are militarily non-aligned , not neutral . 
  * billion ?
