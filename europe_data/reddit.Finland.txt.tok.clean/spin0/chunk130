  politicians are known to abuse things they control and even to the point of detriment to the society . 
  even if i had 100 % trust to politicians i would not give total control to them because you never know who will get elected day after tomorrow nor why . 
  instead i would use * regulation * to monitor the banks and to see they do not put the society under risk with the risks they will be taking in their business . 
  i would also see to it that there would be commonly agreed established mechanisms in place to deal with failing banks before a crisis hits . 
  i have no problem with euro devaluation . 
  good for exports . 
   he knew more about economics than all of the dogmatic chimpanzees at your finance ministry combined . 
  yet he managed to go from a budding recovery to capital controls in mere five months . 
  i mean , even if he had never done anything at all as a finance minister during past five months greece 's economy would have fared better . 
  hell , it would have fared better by having a paperweight or a stapler as greece 's finance minister . 
  pretty much in a nutshell : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfg9xopkk, 
   why do people assume the greek electorate is n't well informed ? 
  well , can * you * explain the question ? 
  you do know they 're voting on an expired deal , do n't you ? 
  even experts do not agree on what the referendum actually entails and what the result would mean - so how could the greek electorate ? 
  after all the idiot blogposts by hacks and pundits posted in this sub it 's refreshing to see a pretty realistic assessment for once . 
  it 's more surreal than that . 
  kke is actually advocating using * their * proposed ballots , which were rejected by the parliament , instead of the actual ones : http://inter.kke.gr/en/articles/the-referendum-on-the-5th-of-july-and-the-stance-of-the-kke/  the kke stresses that the people must not choose between scylla and charybdis , but must express , with all means available and in every way , their opposition to the eu and its permanent memoranda in the referendum . 
  they must `` cancel out '' this dilemma by casting the proposal of the kke as their vote into the ballot box . 
  but then again , when did anyone believe that communists have any relation with reality in the first place . 
   eu council head tusk sees greece inside euro irrespective of poll outcome of course there will be efforts to keep greece in the euro even with a no-vote . 
  the problem is no-one knows how to achieve that and how long it would take - not even donald tusk . 
  and i do n't know why people focus solely on that quote as he said quite few things such as :  no matter how greeks vote sunday , the eu is looking for ways `` to keep them inside '' the single currency , though that may require `` a completely new '' approach to allow the eurozone to coexist with a bankrupt country , donald tusk told politico . 
  ...  tusk said that `` it 's very clear that the referendum is not ... about being in the eurozone or not . 
  no , in fact , nobody 's interested -- ** i hope ** nobody 's interested -- in this kind of choice . '' ...  `` in time of crisis , and it 's not about greece only but all crises , the biggest problem is lack of confidence and trust , '' he added . 
  ** `` the first goal is to rebuild trust in greece . '' **  tusk said the eu will work with athens regardless of sunday 's outcome , though ** `` if the greeks vote yes , i think it 's a chance to open a new chapter in negotiations , perhaps more promising than before . '' **  in that case , the eu would have to first see if tsipras stays on , a new leader takes over or fresh elections are called . 
   ** in case of a no , according to tusk , `` the space for negotiation will be smaller , obviously . 
  ** but i would like to warn , for sure we do n't need any dramatic messages after no voting . '' the eu , he said , would have to wait to hear `` the new proposal of the greek government . '' ...  ** `` maybe we will have to get used to living with a country as a member of the eurozone in bankruptcy . '' ** he added : `` maybe we have to prepare the whole organization -- the eurozone and eu -- to live with countries with such a problem as greece today . '' ...  ** a possible solution is to put greece in a euro `` waiting room , '' ** not formally out of the single currency but in a limbo until it can negotiate its way back in one day . 
  if i were greek that would be pretty hairrising stuff to hear . 
   greece can stay in euro even with ` no ' vote , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble tells lawmakers ** `` for the time being '' ** . 
  and that 's stating the obvious - no-one believes greece would drop out of the euro immediately after a no-vote . 
  greece facing a grexit would be a process that would depend first and foremost on a series of decisions by the greek gov. 
  the capital controls include a ban on transfers of funds abroad which makes importing stuff difficult . 
  such transfers will be assessed on a case by case basis by a special approval committee . 
  one would think that transactions related to importing food and medicine would get accepted by the committee . 
  a second debt restructuring has been on the table since 2012 - on the condition that greece first completes the reforms it has committed to . 
  what greece now seems to want is debt restructuring without fulfilling its commitments or postponing them . 
  that does not fly well with rest of the eurozone as there 's very little trust left on greece actually adhering to its commitments . 
  who said primary surplus comes from loans ? 
  i certainly did n't . 
  are you sure you replied to correct comment . 
  wow . 
  i did not know about any of those issues ( from which i can only conclude that the mods here are be doing darn good job ) . 
  thank you for posting those points . 
   victoria is a nice lady i 'm sure she is . 
  btw , who is victoria and why should / r/europe suddenly go private ? 
  and in solidarity of what ? 
  and for the title , no we should not go private . 
  the only way / r/europe should ever go private is for profit , not some silly ideas of solidarity . 
  how ? 
  well i had the money coming from the creditors so no liquidity problems . 
  and the economy was already recovering so no worries about that either . 
  basically all i would have had to do was not to fuck it up . 
  even doing absolutely nothing would have been better than what v-man achieved during his short reign : from budding recovery to capital controls only in six months . 
  and people still * like * that guy ? 
  fuck that guy . 
  i would have used the money that was coming from the creditors , and for growth i would have done anything but killing it by rocking the boat , instead i would have nurtured the budding recovery - if not knowing how to feed it then at least by protecting it instead of stomping on it . 
  well for starters i would have seen to that greece adheres its commitments , and i would never have risked the whole country and the population in a game . 
  i already told my solution right at the beginning : v-man should resign the sooner the better . 
  never should have been a finance minister in the first place , out of his league , as the results of his few months already testify with the closed banks . 
  the next guy will have an awful job . 
  i do not have solutions for him how to undo the damage v-man has caused . 
  opening the banks , and lifting the capital controls will take time while everyone will be suffering of them . 
  will take at least weeks possibly months to lift all the capital controls and then to proceed to restart the economy . 
  tough job , and even tougher for the population . 
  if i was the greek finance minister that just suddenly had capital controls imposed on his population i would fucking take a good look in the mirror . 
  the relevant thing to think about is what will happen next . 
  if i was the next finance minister the very first thing needing immediate attention would be the liquidity and solvency of the banks . 
  i have no idea how to restore it , never mind quickly , after the royal fuck-up by the v-man . 
  like i said , i think he should have kept his day job . 
  specifically ? 
  well that probably would involve doing things , probably spending time with his wife and friends , and then some , maybe cooking eggs as breakfast , cutting toenails . 
  i do n't know . 
  how specific of a list do you need ? 
  nah , i do n't believe it , and sounds like bullshit to me . 
  it 's not that anything * could * happen when talking best korea , but cmon . 
  seriously . 
  not just any joke should fly to the front page . 
  do what he was actually good at . 
  now he 's out of his league . 
   greece does not have a '' -16 % deficit '' . 
  never said it currently has . 
  greece had such decifit in 2009 . 
  the question was what other way there was to address it but to make cuts on spending . 
  please do feel free to give your opinion on that : how to address a -16 % deficit ? 
   it has a primary surplus yes , thanks to cuts in spending and dirt cheap loans which have kept greece afloat . 
  i hear you but the problem in that remains the same as always : establishing common authority vs. sovereignity . 
  how is it possible that greece was not actually caught redhanded cooking their books until they came clean asking for help ? 
  because the actual evidence of it was unavailable as no-one relevant had the right to do a thorought audit of their books . 
  there actually was a fucking eu audit on greece in 2004 but as they did not have the authority conduct it thouroughly it was a joke . 
  how the fuck is it possible that no-one thought of that before ? 
  well , everyone actually did think of that . 
  yet when the eurozone was established some countries went `` muh sovereignity ! '', 
  and it was finally agreed that the ez would not have the authority to actually enter and audit a country . 
  i know how little that makes sense , but at the time they actually thought it was a web trust between partner countries , and that surely no-one would be silly enough to do a suicide by joining it with false pretenses . 
  they really thought that the countries would be responsible enough to be honest enough . 
  you laugh at it , and i laugh at it . 
  but that 's how it went . 
   honestly , if the eu could standardize a `` reform '' process that really worked , it would be a huge advancement . 
  well , if you look at the eu history it actually has really worked and is working .
