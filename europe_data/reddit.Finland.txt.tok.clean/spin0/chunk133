  bloomberg just did a very interesting live-interview with the greek ex-pm antonis samaras ( paraphrasing : we are forming a non-partisan yes-platform , and move from there after the yes wins ) . 
  and an interview with the current greek minister of state nikos pappas ( syriza ) who claimed that the banks would open on monday ( !? 
  ) , and implied their government would not necessarily resign after a yes-vote . 
  everyone also knows that debt restructuring has been on the table since 2012 - on the condition of greece making the necessary reforms first . 
  what v-man seems to demand is debt restructuring without that condition , albeit after all the mixed messages i do n't know what the greek government is actually demanding any more . 
   ( personally i think deposits are at risk either way , yes or no . ), 
  indeed . 
  when capital controls are introduced it is very difficult to lift them without creating an immediate bank run . 
  that 's why they tend remain in place for a long time . 
  i do n't know what greek government 's plan is , how are they planning to lift the capital controls or if they did plan for it at all when they introduced them , but whatever the outcome of the referendum they will have to remain in place for quite some time . 
  the banks will remain closed next week whether there will be a yes or a no . 
  when tsipras claims everybody 's deposits and pensions are safe in the banks , the actual reality of the situation is that the banks are insolvent and his claim contradicts that reality . 
  and when varoufakis claimed today that the banks will open on tuesday he speaks from la-la-land . 
  that is merely what they have to say even if they know how little it reflects the reality . 
  yet that does n't mean the consequences would be same whether the greeks vote yes or no . 
  obviously there are more risks associated with the no vote , and that includes the heightened risk of a bail-in and people losing their savings : [ referendum to determine future of greece 's banks , economists say ] ( http://cyprusbusinessmail.com/?p=10803 ), 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , whether he visits an atm or not is inconsequential to the greek economy , and there are far more pressing issues at hand . 
  just added it as a human interest point . 
   as for bloomberg , i do n't have a tv : / try here : http://www.bloomberg.com/live or find an alternative streaming service with google . 
  just some of the points : * he claimed the greek banks would open on tuesday ( no , i do n't believe it ) * he claimed the ecb would somehow bend its rules without specifying how exactly * he wants greece to remain in euro * he 'd rather cut his arm off than sign a deal without debt restructuring * he would resign after a yes-vote * human interest : he and his wife have n't qued to an atm for 60 $ but that 's just some the stuff he said . 
  still have n't found links to the interview online . 
  bloomberg tv is running it if you can watch it . 
  and guardian live blog has some more quotes : http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/02/greek-debt-crisis-athens-creditors-referendum-yes-no-live edit : he also claimed that a new deal can be made almost immediately after the referendum . 
  that is a dangerous assumption to make . 
  he does n't seem to understand the difference of extending the second bailout ( could have been a quick process if he had n't let that expire ) and negotiating a completely new third bailout ( will be a lenghty process any way you look at it ) . 
  there will be no quick deal after the referendum . 
  putting together a new bailout will take time . 
  also wikipedia is generally pretty poor source for up-to-date economic data . 
  i would go to sources such as the eurostat . 
  for example : * [ mean and median income by household type ( source : silc ) last update : 15-06-2015 ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_di04&amp;lang=en ) * [ wages and labour costs ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/wages_and_labour_costs ), 
  v-man just gave a 20 minute interview for bloomberg television . 
  it was absolute tv gold but does n't seem to be available online as of yet . 
  i 'll post links if i find one . 
  you 're confusing the [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) ( not eu organization ) and the [ european council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council ) ( eu institution with heads of member states/governments ) . 
  dijsselbloem 's statement on greece in full : http://tvnewsroom.consilium.europa.eu/video/president-of-the-eurogroup-dijsselbloem-statement-on-greece, 
  i think it 's smarter just to wait and see how syriza implodes with a yes . 
  as you can see from the graph the pmi went below 50 ( = contraction ) in late 2014 and has remained below it since then with an accelerating fall . 
  what that graph tells us the manufacturing was expanding in 2014 (  50 ) , and that syriza has not succeeded in maintaining the expansion but to the contrary accelerated contraction . 
  the same goes for exports which were growing in 2014 but have been falling rapidly this year . 
  also in 2014 job creation and employment were improving but during syriza 's reign the employment at factories has been falling , albeit only modestly so far . 
  except for greece where production fell at the fastest rate for two years : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/82ivwln.png ) good job syriza killing the budding recovery instead of nurturing it . 
   i think you need to read the article a bit closer : this is about a new , separate bailout , not the extension of the old bailout . 
  it 's about both :  the hellenic republic is prepared to accept this staff level agreement subject to the following amendments , additions or clarifications , as part of an extension of the expiring efsf program and the new esm loan agreement or more precisely it * was * about both as the second bailout has already expired and that letter is dead on arrival . 
   let 's hope this can be settled today . 
  the window for a quick deal closed last weekend when there was still a realistic chance to extend the second bailout . 
  now the situation is very different in many ways . 
  after the referendum there will be negotiations whatever the result of the referendum . 
  the question is what they may be about , when they would take place , and how long will it take . 
  one thing is certain : there is no chance of a quick deal any more . 
  none . 
  now any negotiation would be about a third bailout which would have to be first negotiated and then accepted by the national parliaments in the ez countries . 
  that will be a long process . 
  any way you look at it , that will take at least several weeks or possibly months . 
  and it requires a deal that has a realistic chance of getting accepted by the national parliaments , some of which have very little trust left on greece after the circus this year . 
  ( an additional complication : it 's summer and some parliaments will be on break - for example , the finnish parliament just had its closing session and will convene next time only in september . ), 
  on july 20 greece will likely miss the $ 6.7 bn payment to the ecb . 
  and defaulting on ecb debt is a bad thing further risking the ela as greece 's lifeline . 
  the letter : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ci0skpnwwaagpmg.jpg looks like tsipras has lost his touch with the reality . 
  there 's absolutely no way whatsoever to * extend * the esfs program that has * already expired * . 
  the last chance to do that was last weekend but he used those days campaining for his ` historic no ' . 
  holding the referendum is up to greeks not the eurogroup , and it looks like the referendum will happen even as it 's unclear what the options actually hold in them ( currently they look like : yes = tsipras out , no = grexit ) . 
  yesterday v-man reportedly tried to persuade the eurogroup to give debt relief in exchange of calling off the referendum . 
  that did n't fly well . 
   all negotiations up until this point will be for nothing and must be started over if a new government coalition can be formed yes , we all know there will be negotiations whatever the result of the referendum . 
  the question is what they may be about , when they would take place , and how long will it take . 
  one thing is certain : there is no chance of a quick deal any more . 
  none . 
  that window closed last weekend when the last chance to extend the second bailout program passed . 
  now any negotiation would be about a third bailout which would have to be first negotiated and then accepted by the national parliaments in the ez countries . 
  that will be a long process . 
  any way you look at it , that will take at least several weeks or possibly months . 
  and it requires a deal that has a realistic chance of getting accepted by the national parliaments , some of which have very little trust left on greece after the circus this year . 
  ( an additional complication : it 's summer and some parliaments will be on break - for example , the finnish parliament just had its closing session and will convene next time only in september . ), 
  on july 20 greece will likely miss the $ 6.7 bn payment to the ecb . 
  and defaulting on ecb is a bad thing . 
  reportedly v-man 's latest trick was this : https://twitter.com/stefanleifert/status/615951781177225216  varoufakis hat in eurogruppe angeboten , referendum gegen schuldenschnitt zu tauschen . 
  * varoufakis offered in euro group to swap referendum against debt restructuring . 
  * which raises the question of how desperate can a game theorist get before quitting ? 
  yeah the danes have a weird language . 
  if that makes them happy so be it . 
  and we 'll all be happy as long as we hate the swedes together . 
  yup . 
  made me shake my head in disbelief . 
  also the recommendation to look at the comments section `` for insight '' . 
  * varoufakis offered in euro group to swap referendum against debt restructuring . 
  * if true it 's one more sign of a suddenly desperate game theorist . 
  let 's wait and see if it 's just mangled reporting . 
  now the guardian live blog reports : http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras#block-5592f529e4b075e173d5312b * `` there 's some dispute tonight about exactly what dragasakis said on tv . 
  so , for greek readers , here 's a clip : '' * i do n't know what is actually said in the clip . 
   it 's odd to think about how irrelevant european elections tend to be , to the media , to european parties , and to the national parties who use them as an extension of their national campaign . 
  under which rock are you writing from ? 
  well , the market reactions seem to say that they do n't have much leverage at all . 
  i think the game theorist has miscalculated , and hence the desperate sudden request for a third bailout . 
  not that they believe they could get it now but to boost the no-vote to stay in power as a yes-vote would mean it 's all over for tsipras and v-man . 
   it does absolutely work . 
  just no . 
  the ecb mandate does not allow that . 
   that 's what 's `` emergency '' about it . 
  again , no .
