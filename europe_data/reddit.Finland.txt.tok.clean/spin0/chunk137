   yeah they will totally bomb the fuck out of stockholm and kill tens of thousands of people . 
  yeah that was like so totally what i said . 
   they have nothing to gain from this . 
  so , can you tell why has russia been making mock bombing runs towards stockholm ? 
  aerobatics ? 
  sports ? 
  nothing better to do ? 
  ... that is a historical injustice albeit of temporary nature ... 
   russia would put up more troops near swedish borders sweden does not share a border with russia . 
   they 're not doing anything you think invading swedish airspace with military aircrafts and making mock bombing runs towards stockholm is not ` doing anything ' ? 
  for example this russian su-24 in june 14 2013 .

  reminds me of late 1930s and 1940 when nordic countries were contemplating a defensive alliance which was opposed by the soviet union and nazi germany . 
  in 1940 sweden and finland were about to sign a defensive pact but at the last minute sweden backed down as the soviet union declared such defensive alliance a * casus belli * . 
  yet russia is has been making mock bombing runs towards stockholm . 
  looks like sweden is a military target for russia anyway , is n't it ? 
  [ fonds mon\u00e9taire international ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/french/index.htm ), 
   that is n't the justification that was used here though . 
  the greek austerity program was purely about the economic fantasies of the ecb ( which they still hold to ) . 
  the greek program was designed to create growth , not primarily because they could n't afford otherwise . 
  the program target has always been firstly to address greece 's huge deficit on short term ( by budget cuts ) and to promote growth on mid-to-long term ( by structural reforms ) . 
  and those both were achieved : greece 's deficit turned into primary surplus , and economy did return to growth . 
  source : http://www.imf.org/external/country/grc/index.htm  their government should have played brinkmanship on day one . 
  greece would have been much better off . 
  in 2008 deficit was 9.8 % in 2009 deficit was whopping 15.4 % that leaves very little room for brinkmanship . 
  at the time the greek gov was contemplating all their options and also considered defaulting under their debts . 
  but as their calculations ( they even had some argentinan experts helping out with the estimates ) showed that default was their worst option they decided to ask for a bailout from the imf/eurozone . 
  yup . 
  it 's grim read . 
  i read it as a last-ditch effort to voice reason . 
  `` this is why the bank of greece firmly believes that striking an agreement with our partners is * a historical imperative * that we can not afford to ignore . '', 
   tl ; dr i 'm reading the demands from 5 years ago and not the demands of a negotiationg table from today probably because the european commission has not been making any additional demands . 
  they are the same and greece has already committed to those years ago . 
  remind me , how many civilian airliners have americans shot down ? 
  one ? 
  would n't call a single incident a tradition .

  i 'll tell you more about my new home , comet # 67p soon ... zzzzz #cometlanding [ today ] ( https://twitter.com/philae2014/status/610047412036595712 ) :  hello earth !, 
  can you hear me ? 
  i 'm awake !, 
  how long have i been asleep ? 
   imf just rejected a proposal from greece and eu ( agreed upon with tsipras & juncker ) to cut 400 million euros from military expenses instead of low pensions . 
  yeh , except that the imf has not said to cut the small pensions . 
  the 400 million savings do not mean the 're demanding to cut the small pensions as that can be achieved by reforming the pension system ( re : the document i just linked to you ) . 
  you 're apparently arguing dishonestly . 
  no reason to waste more time with you . 
  [ the kalevala ( according to scott sandwich ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzhf-acniyw ), 
   heh , you 're dropping a 230 pages document and ask me to find your claim somewhere in there . 
  seems legit . 
  yup . 
  it 's legit . 
   specifically , the imf asks for at least 400 million euros of pension cuts ( for now ) specifically , where exactly has the imf said that ? 
  the imf reforms do include cost savings . 
  there are many ways to achieve savings and not all of them are about cuts to pensions . 
  additionally , as i already said , the imf is not demanding cutting the small pensions . 
   by the way , what about taxes ? 
  is there also something i should look for in that book you attached ? 
  quite a lot . 
  that document is the shit . 
   actually this is n't true at all . 
  actually it is . 
   however , regarding pensions , they have stated explicitly ( through gerry rice , their spokesperson and christine lagarde ) that pensions should be `` reformed '' because they 're too generous . 
  yes , reforming the pension system has been the objective and greece has previously already argeed to it . 
  the imf has not demanded cutting the small pensions , and protecting the most vulnerable has been one of imf 's terms . 
  you can read about the pension system reforms on this document describing them and the related developments : [ fifth review under the extended arrangement ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14151.pdf ) it is just you who choose to add scare quotes on the word reform and read it as cutting the small pensions . 
   the imf believes there is no way around pension cuts , both to achieve the surplus now and to make it viable in the long run . 
  the european institutions have already said that they do n't insist on this specific measure but also that they have not yet been offered an alternative which they believe to be credible . 
  additionally , there is no demand of across the board cuts to pensions . 
  the imf has been very clear the most vulnerabe should be protected ( i.e. 
  small pensions ) . 
   expell them from the country they are welcome in ? 
  they 're not welcome to moldova . 
  they have no mandate of being in the country , russia has signed a treaty of withdrawing them long ago , and since 1997 moldova has repeatedly asked russia to actually withdraw its troops as has been agreed . 
  yup . 
  the russian troops have overstayed their welcome and their mandate by two decades already . 
  this from 1998 : [ moldova experiences the worth of moscow 's signature on troop withdrawal treaty . 
  ] ( http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=17035&amp;amp;tx_ttnews%5bbackpid%5d=212&amp;amp;no_cache=1#.u-tpj3yf5_0 )  four years elapsed yesterday since russia pledged to withdraw all its troops and arsenals from moldova within three years . 
  russia also committed to withdraw both its weapons and its troops , once again , at osce 1999 summit in istanbul . 
  etc. . . 
  also , with the much higher frequency of flying missions russia seems to have problems with maintenance : [ ` overstretched ' russian air force suffers three crashes in five days ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/overstretched-russian-air-force-suffers-three-jet-crashes-five-days-328470 )  `` this could be an interesting sign of the overstretching of russian armed capabilities , because the maintenance template for these vehicles does not take into account the much higher operational tempo they have been operating under lately , '' sutyagin says . 
   `` the bear bombers for example are designed for a single strike on missions not for extended training flights , '' he concluded . 
   ... `` looking at the bears , the newest one of them was produced in 1992 . 
  it 's more than 20 years old . 
  no one can exclude mishaps on any flying machine especially one that is overexerted . 
  that is why you can not rule out a mishap such as this happening in european skies , '',

   i am just confused why you did not call / u/chemicalpleasure [ 1 ] [ +4 ] ( sorry mobile ) out for trivializing the crisis . 
  ah , then you probably should have asked me about that . 
  i did not call out because i did not read the comment as trivializing . 
  yes , the crisis was even more dangerous than what many commonly think of it .
