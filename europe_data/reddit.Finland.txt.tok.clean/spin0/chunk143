  ysk the effect of the falling oil prices always has some inertia . 
  first i 'm talking about your unverified claim that you 're `` a financial/commodity trader '' . 
  then i 'm talking about the oil price and the related inertia which seems to be unknown to you . 
  i can not put it any clearer so here 's to hoping that clarification helps . 
  the dutch safety board has already published their preliminary report months ago . 
  the full final report will take time which is normal as they often take even years to complete . 
   too many conflicting views as to what actually happened . 
  their investigation is not about whodunnit or where the missile originated . 
  that is not what such investigations are for . 
  they are meant to investigate the technical side of things , e.g. 
  investigate in detail what happened to the plane in the breakup and what implications/recommendations that may have . 
  the ongoing criminal investigations go further , they are investigating questions such as who fired the missile , where , when and the origins of the missile . 
  the su planned and invaded finland not only once but * twice * ( albeit on second time the su attacked they arguably had a legitimate casus belli ) . 
  both times they were stopped and instead of occupying the country and the unconditional surrender they demanded the su had to settle for some clay and negotiated peace instead . 
  only afterwards did the su change their story and pretend negotiated peace was what they wanted in the first place , which is directly contradicted by the fact that they had already formed a puppet government for their planned soviet republic of finland , and they only dropped their demands of unconditional surrender after their massive attacks had been brought to halt . 
   what are you blabing ? 
  you boldly claimed : `` there is a trend according to your own charts where it is falling '' i informed you that one month is not a trend . 
  on which official report ? 
  there are several ongoing investigations from the incident investigation by the dutch safety board to criminal investigations . 
  you know what 's stupid ? 
  confusing ad-hom attacks for critique . 
  hey , while you 're at it you forgot these civilian airliner shootdowns : [ kaleva ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaleva_ ( airplane \\ ) ) shot down by the ussr . 
  [ korean air lines flight 902 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_902 ) shot down by the ussr . 
  [ korean air lines flight 007 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) shot down by the ussr . 
  and there 's also these no less than * three * airliners that russian rebels backed and armed by russia shot down in georgia in september 1993 : [ transair georgia airliner shootdowns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transair_georgia_airliner_shootdowns ) looks like some have far more experteese on shooting down civilian airliners than others ... 
  right , yet it 's not only the baltic sea but also the northern finland would be strategically very important to occupy . 
  so , basically the whole country from the coast to lapland . 
   there are no those reasons in finland except for the possibility of nato the primary reason remains the same as always : geography . 
  has n't changed for millenia , and has always been the reason why russia/ussr has repeatedly invaded finland through the centuries . 
  if there was a larger conflict in europe , russia would try and invade finland just as it has always done . 
  no declaration of neutrality would help to keep finland out of it , nor would being outside of nato ( in fact that would only make finland even more lucrative target for invasion ) . 
  the only way to convince russia not to try it is to have convincing enough defence - either within nato or without . 
  correct , correct , and ohjelma = ett program, 
   why would we ever invade finland . 
  the only reason i can think of is `` geopolitical necessity and national security '' as you said about invading ukraine . 
  well , as a finn i have never heard finland saying so . 
   during the worst of the fallen o\u00efl prices the economy grew at 0,4 % ... 
  did n't you just claim you 're `` a financial/commodity trader '' ? 
  ysk the effect of the falling oil prices always has some inertia . 
  here 's how the contraction of russia 's gdp looks like : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wgsgbvj.png )  the economy has a strong industrial base that as soon the economy crash start to take over the growth . 
  dude , russia 's manufacturing pmi is below 50 . 
  and it just fell even more to 47.6 . 
   i clearly wrote it is falling and will reach pre crisis level there is a trend according to your own charts where it is falling and where it will reach an all time low according to prediction . 
  dude , one month does not a trend make . 
   finland said it was because we were lazy and that we just had to work more . 
  could you point out where exactly finland has said that ? 
   may as well keep the trade up . 
  right , but the problem is the russians have less money to spend . 
  finnish exports are dropping but not because they 're on the eu 's prohibited exports list but first and foremost because the russian economy is contracting . 
  for example , by far the biggest export category has been machinery ( 32 % of exports in 2013 , sitc category : machinery and transport equipment ) . 
  as russia 's economy is tanking there will be less demand for such . 
  which does not tell much anything . 
  for perspective here 's the annual figures 2000-14 : [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nautixu.png ) edit : as you can see the 2008-9 fall in exports was about -53 % . 
  when russian 's have less money they import less hence the finnish exports fall . 
   i was curious how trade has changed since the start of the crisis in ukraine you might want to take a longer time series for perspective . 
  i believe the 2008-9 drop was probably even larger . 
   russia sanctions hit and our economy is hit again . 
  it 's not so much direct effect of sanctions and countersanctions but the weak ruble and the fact that russia 's economy is contracting . 
  and of course the sanctions do play a role in those but so do the oil prices and the structure of russia 's economy . 
  already about a year ago ( iirc ) the estimates said that if russia 's economy contracts by 3-4 % the effect will be about -0.5 % in finland . 
   many banned russians have absolutely nothing to do with ukraine and crimea . 
  can you point out such persons from the list ? 
  who and how many are they ? 
  blatter will go out , if not tomorrow then in the near future . 
  he has already eaten his chocolates . 
   blatter is pretty old himself . 
  he would have to have pretty shitty lawyers to not drag out his case for a year or two . 
  and sooner or later , he will probably be too old/sick/well-connected to be kept in a proper prison . 
  yes , yes , and so what ? 
  does n't matter if he would be in a proper prison or not . 
  what matters is that blatter goes out . 
  right . 
  that 's the cost of authoritarian leadership . 
  the minimum bet is a generation . 
  doubling down costs more . 
   simultaneous ? 
  yes , in the sense that in the same day ( yesterday ) they both proceeded with raids/arrests/interviews . 
  both investigations have also co-operated . 
   us investigation is a couple years old . 
  basically they are finishing up the investigation now . 
  the us investigators said this is just the beginning . 
   afaict the swiss investigation is new . 
  yes , that has been opened recently . 
  * do not become completely retarded ever !, 
  apparently he still believes he 's untouchable . 
  has n't read the fucking indictment or does n't realise rico has been invoked . 
  the indictment is like 160 pages long but i do recommend reading it , even if from here and there because the shit in there is ... do n't even know how to put it . 
  try reading it , and you 'll see what i mean : http://images.businessweek.com/bloomberg/pdfs/fifaindictment.pdf  warner stated , `` there are some people here who think they are more pious than thou . 
  if you 're pious , open a church , friends . 
  our business is our business . '' right on brother . 
  your and your pals ' business was to destroy a fine sport for your personal profit . 
  ( oh and btw , ~ ~ nike ~ ~ no i mean `` sportswear company a '' stock owners might want to consider their options of balancing their briefcase as there may be trouble at the horizon with the law and stuff like that . 
  rico is the bad cop with the porn moustache from the '70s movies . 
  with rico not only those who planned and committed the crimes but also those who benefited are brought to justice . 
  so , now as rico has been invoked : dear blatter , good luck with that . 
  no money is going to buy your way out of it . 
  no , not even your fucking billions . 
  rico already has your corrupt geriatric over-80 subordinates who will love to make a deal over dying in prison old age , and they 'll tell all about it . 
  they will .
