  your only hope is to remain permanently in some hole from where you will not get extradiced when the time comes . 
  in any case you 're over even if you still have the tomorrow 's election bought out . 
  and , most importantly : no football fan will miss you when you 're gone . 
  ever . 
  and that 's your legacy . 
  forever . 
  now think about that . 
  indeed . 
  the fact that blatter has n't stepped down already speaks volumes about his integrity or lack of thereof . 
  the guys who got arrested were not some small fishes but current or former members of the executive committee which blatter runs as the president . 
  and the charges are not about something random that happened just last week - they 're about systemic , deep-rooted fraud and corruption which has been going on since the '90s and runs into hundreds of millions . 
  under blatter 's watch fifa became an international multi-billion fraud machine . 
  he is fucking responsible . 
  either he was in it too , or he is utterly incompetent to run an organisation . 
  either way it 's time for him to own up to it , to act responsibly and step down . 
   why switzerland have n't investigated the case ? 
  they are : http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/27/world/europe/ap-soc-fifa-raids.html there are two separate but simultaneous investigations : the us investigation and the swiss one . 
  `` and we sincerely hope the bribing will not be used to cast a shadow on the organization 's decisions , including personnel decisions . '', 
  and : '' , including personnel decisions . '', 
  which makes perfect sense - only in russian foreign ministry . 
  yup . 
  seems the probe has hit a nerve there . 
  the crimes the defendands are charged with were committed and/or planned in the us . 
  the confederation of north , central american and caribbean association football ( concacaf ) headquarters , which was raided today , is located in miami . 
  they did also use swiss bank accounts . 
  but money has to move from one place another , for example through the us banks . 
   and yet , not a single european arrested . 
  costas takkas , the current attach\u00e9 to the concacaf president and former cifa general secretary is a uk citizen . 
  all the others are from the us , caribbean or latin america . 
  why ? 
  because concacaf . 
   i wonder how long it will take people to notice the pattern of the background of the individuals who have been arrested . 
  it 's exceedingly easy to spot the pattern : it 's concacaf and related organisations . 
  concacaf has it 's headquarters in miami , and the alleged crimes have been committed and/or planned in the us . 
  [ or sardine liquor ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3djsqb1img4 ), 
  no , i 'm not worried about their wellbeing . 
  i mean who would be when there 's characters like this guy :  few people in brazil are likely to mourn the arrest in zurich today of jos\u00e9 maria marin , the dictatorship-era politician and former head of the brazilian football confederation . 
   swiss police detained the 83-year-old as part of their swoop on fifa officials allegedly involved in money laundering and bribery . 
   it is far from the first controversy surrounding the cbf president , who is from the same clique of brazilian football kingpins as his predecessor ricardo teixeira and fifa president jo\u00e3o havelange - both of whom were embroiled in corruption scandals . 
   marin 's appointment in 2012 was controversial as a result of his support for the country 's military dictatorship and his alleged association with the torture and killing of a journalist , vladimir herzog . 
   herzog 's son , ivo has said marin should take some responsibility for the death of his father because in 1975 , when the future head of the cbf was still a state congressman , he publicly denounced herzog and called for the authorities to take action . 
  the journalist was arrested soon after on the orders of police chief s\u00e9rgio fleury and died in prison tafter undergoing repeated electric shocks . 
  a year later , an unrepentant marin praised fleury for fulfilling his duties `` in the most praiseworthy manner . '' http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/may/27/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-live#block-5565e146e4b0ab5615399b13, 
  it is high time indeed . 
  yet one can not seriously talk about fifa 's `` reform process '' - when they actually got surprised pants down - and at the same time promote blatter for president . 
   are you satisfied that they have expressly stated ratifying ttip is one of their goals in government ? 
  they have n't . 
  this is what [ the coalition programme says ] ( http://www.keskusta.fi/loader.aspx?id=c3374414-88d8-4b64-87a4-27faab2880c5 ) :  vapaakaupan edist\u00e4minen parantaa suomen vientiteollisuuden markkinoillep\u00e4\u00e4sy\u00e4 . 
  and i agree with all those points : free trade makes it easier for finnish exports to reach markets , a free trade and investment treaty between the eu and the us is an important goal , and such treaty has to secure the rule of law , food security , and right to non-discriminatingly regulate for better enviromental protection and for consumer rights among others . 
  i 'm okay with the stated goals . 
  actually ratifying the treaty falls within the competence of the parliament , not the government which can not ratify it . 
  the doj press conference is about to start , pbs live stream : [ watch live : doj press conference on soccer corruption scandal ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/watch-live-doj-press-conference-soccer-corruption-scandal/ ), 
  watching the press conference i loled when de gregorio tried to spin this all somehow as a part of fifa 's `` reform process '' , as if it was fifa intiating it . 
  well , the doj lists them as convicted : http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and, 
  more funnies from russia :  vyacheslav koloskov , a former longstanding fifa vice-president from russia , tells bbc russian he did not witnessed any corruption schemes during his time in the fifa . 
   mr koloskov says : `` when i worked in fifa nobody has been arrested or suspended , so there was no corruption , but i 'm out of work in the organisation for six years and am no longer a member of the fifa executive committee . 
  i do n't know how strong a blow it will be for fifa , we have to wait for blatter 's comments . '', 
   mr koloskov took part in russia 's successful campaign to host the 2018 world cup . 
  see , nobody was arrested or suspended so there was no corruption . 
  checkmate atheists !, 
  even funnier , he himself is being questioned in z\u00fcrich : http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/may/27/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-live#block-5565ad62e4b00e009a9836c1  owen gibson has the names of the ten individuals , all currently listed as current fifa executive committee members , who will now be questioned by swiss authorities over the 2018/22 world cup bids . 
  sepp blatter and michel platini , as swiss residents , are not included , but will also presumably be questioned . 
   they are : issa hayatou ( president of the confederation of african football ) , angel maria villar llona ( spain ) , michel d\u2019hooghe ( belgium ) , senes erzik ( turkey ) , worawi makudi ( thailand ) , marios lefkaritis ( cyprus ) , jacques anouma ( ivory coast ) , rafael salguero ( guatemala ) , hany abo rida ( egypt ) and ** vitaly mutko ( russia -- head of the 2018 world cup and sport 's minister ) ** . 
  i 'm not laughing . 
   but they 've got shit to do with the us . 
  the us simply is n't relevant in any way . 
  except the concacaf headquarters is in miami , florida , and the charges concern crimes planned and committed in the us . 
  this swiss investigation is directly linked to it : http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/27/world/europe/ap-soc-fifa-raids.html  swiss federal prosecutors opened criminal proceedings related to the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 world cups , throwing fifa deeper into crisis only hours after seven soccer officials were arrested and 14 indicted wednesday in a separate u.s. corruption probe . 
  he has a diplomatic immunity ? 
  in which country ? 
  doj : http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and  the indicted and convicted individual defendants face maximum terms of incarceration of 20 years for the rico conspiracy , wire fraud conspiracy , wire fraud , money laundering conspiracy , money laundering and obstruction of justice charges . 
  in addition , eugenio figueredo faces a maximum term of incarceration of 10 years for a charge of naturalization fraud and could have his u.s. citizenship revoked . 
  he also faces a maximum term of incarceration of five years for each tax charge . 
  charles blazer faces a maximum term of incarceration of 10 years for the fbar charge and five years for the tax evasion charges ; and daryan and daryll warner face maximum terms of incarceration of 10 years for structuring financial transactions to evade currency reporting requirements . 
  each individual defendant also faces mandatory restitution , forfeiture and a fine . 
  by the terms of their plea agreements , the corporate defendants face fines of $ 500,000 and one year of probation . 
  and of course , if the seven fifa officials arrested this morning make deals pleading guilty that would probably affect their sentences . 
  but make no mistake , they 're facing very serious charges with very serious sentences if found guilty in a trial . 
  four individuals and two businesses have already been convicted as per their plea deals . 
   the convicted defendants :  charles blazer  age : 70  nationality : usa  jos\u00c9 hawilla  age : 71  nationality : brazil  daryan warner  age : 46  nationality : trinidad and tobago , grenada  daryll warner  age : 40  nationality : usa , trinidad and tobago  traffic sports international inc.  registered : british virgin islands  traffic sports usa inc.  registered : usa doj press release : http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and, 
  the investigation is ongoing but so far the us attorney general 's case involves nine fifa officials and five corporate executives as defendants . 
  seven of the fifa officials were arrested this morning in z\u00fcrich . 
  the doj press release is very informative : [ nine fifa officials and five corporate executives indicted for racketeering conspiracy and corruption ] ( http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and )  the defendants include two current fifa vice presidents and the current and former presidents of the confederation of north , central american and caribbean association football ( concacaf ) ; seven defendants arrested overseas ; guilty pleas for four individual defendants and two corporate defendants also unsealed these seven were arrested this morning in z\u00fcrich :  also earlier this morning , swiss authorities in zurich arrested seven of the defendants charged in the indictment , the defendants jeffrey webb , eduardo li , julio rocha , costas takkas , eugenio figueredo , rafael esquivel and jos\u00e9 maria marin , at the request of the united states . 
  in addition to them four individuals and two businesses have already pleaded guilty and have been convicted :  the guilty pleas of the four individual and two corporate defendants that were also unsealed today include the guilty pleas of charles blazer , the long-serving former general secretary of concacaf and former u.s. representative on the fifa executive committee ; jos\u00e9 hawilla , the owner and founder of the traffic group , a multinational sports marketing conglomerate headquartered in brazil ; and two of hawilla 's companies , traffic sports international inc. and traffic sports usa inc. , which is based in florida . 
  at least some of those probably made plea deals and reportedly charles blazer wore a fbi wiretap recording conversations that took place at fifa meetings . 
  it 's so ridiculous it 's not even funny . 
  fifa spokesman walter de gregorio 's first statement in the morning :  '' [ blatter ] is not one of the ones arrested . 
  he is not involved at all '' why of course , it makes perfect sense that the long time president of the organisation is `` not involved at all '' in how the organisation is run . 
  later , the us attorney general loretta lynch :  `` the indictment alleges ** corruption that is rampant , systemic , and deep-rooted ** both abroad and here in the united states . 
   `` it ** spans at least two generations of soccer officials ** who , as alleged , have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks . '', 
   away from the press conference , the us department of justice has released a statement to the media saying 14 defendants have been charged with `` racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies '' over a 24-year period . 
   four individual defendants and two corporate defendants have pleaded guilty . 
  and , the acting us attorney kelly t currie :  `` after decades of what the indictment alleges to be brazen corruption , organised international soccer needs a new start . '', 
   `` it needs a new chance for its governing institutions to provide honest oversight and support of a sport that is beloved across the world , increasingly so here in the united states . '', 
   '' ** let me be clear : this indictment is not the final chapter in our investigation . 
  ** '' meanwhile in the z\u00fcrich press conference , fifa spokesman walter de gregorio : `` the president ( sepp blatter ) is not involved , how can you say he has to step down ? 
  he is the president , if he is re-elected then he is the president for the next four years . '', 
   what would that even be ? 
  yellow snow cones ?
