  there were some mangled reports that this morning blatter had been trying to postpone the vote while al-hussein opposed . 
  but just a moment ago this was denied by fifa director of communications and public affairs walter de gregorio in the still ongoing press conference :  the first [ question ] is about suggestions that sepp blatter is now actively looking to postpone friday 's presidential election . 
   `` then you know more than i do then because there was never such an idea to postpone either the congress or the election , '' replies de gregorio  `` one thing has nothing to do with the other so we go on with the agenda and the election will take place as planned . '', 
   '' [ blatter ] is not one of the ones arrested . 
  he is not involved at all , '' fifa spokesman walter de gregorio told the associated press . 
  why of course , it makes perfect sense that the long time president of the organisation is `` not involved at all '' in running of said organisation . 
  edit : us attorney general loretta lynch :  `` the indictment alleges corruption that is rampant , systemic , and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the united states . 
   `` it spans at least two generations of soccer officials who , as alleged , have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks . '', 
   away from the press conference , the us department of justice has released a statement to the media saying 14 defendants have been charged with `` racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies '' over a 24-year period . 
   four individual defendants and two corporate defendants have pleaded guilty . 
  acting us attorney kelly t currie :  `` after decades of what the indictment alleges to be brazen corruption , organised international soccer needs a new start . '', 
   `` it needs a new chance for its governing institutions to provide honest oversight and support of a sport that is beloved across the world , increasingly so here in the united states . '', 
   `` let me be clear : this indictment is not the final chapter in our investigation . '', 
  meanwhile in the z\u00fcrich press conference , fifa spokesman walter de gregorio : `` the president ( sepp blatter ) is not involved , how can you say he has to step down ? 
  he is the president , if he is re-elected then he is the president for the next four years . '', 
   twenty years in a us federal prison is nothing to sniff at . 
  some of those guys are so old and fragile they 'd be lucky if they survived a year . 
  for example eugenio figueredo from uruguay is 83 years old . 
   also the feds have a squealer . 
  there is somebody who was on the inside who gave them up to get favorable treatment in their own criminal proceedings . 
  reportedly that person was chuck blazer . 
  from bbc 's richard conway :  from reports emanating from the us late last year , what is understood is that a man by the name of chuck blazer , who was a very powerful fifa official for a number of years , was turned into a co-operating witness for the fbi . 
   that obviously attracted the attention of law enforcement . 
  they , according to reports , gave him a wiretap and that was used at a series of meetings in london in summer 2012 in which conversations took place with a number of leading officials . 
  those conversations are said to have spurred on this investigation and today i think we are starting to see the results , perhaps , of those conversations - that wiretap evidence . 
  this investigation has been ongoing in the us . 
  i wonder how this will affect the vote for the fifa president scheduled on friday . 
  it 's supposed to be blatter against prince ali bin al-hussein of jordan . 
  this from yesterday : [ prince ali reports ` criminal approach ' offering 47 fifa votes and information ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/26/prince-ali-reports-criminal-approach-offering-47-fifa-votes-information-sepp-blatter )  \u2022 fifa presidential candidate 's team claims individual ` could deliver 47 votes ' \u2022 prince ali 's team alleges it was also offered details of sepp blatter 's finances \u2022 sepp blatter is scared of life after fifa , says michel platini, 
  here 's the swiss federal office of justice press release with some more info : [ six soccer officials detained pending extradition ] ( https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/en/home/aktuell/news/2015/2015-27-05.html )  the zurich cantonal police will question the detainees today on behalf of the foj regarding the us request for their arrest . 
  a simplified procedure will apply for wanted persons who agree to their immediate extradition . 
  the foj can immediately approve their extradition to the us and order its execution . 
  however , if a wanted person opposes their extradition , the foj will invite the us to submit a formal extradition request within the deadline of 40 days specified in the bilateral extradition treaty . 
  `` this is an exceptional engraving of urist mcaceshigh the dronepilot and dwarves . 
  urist mcaceshigh is surrounded by the dwarves . 
  urist mcaceshigh is making a victorious gesture . 
  the dwarves are rising their goblets . 
  the dwarves look joyful . 
  the artwork relates to urist mcaceshigh winning a war while intoxicated in a tavern in the summer of 2015 . '', 
  or it might invite swarms of insects , small animals and then predators causing a potentially hilarious chaos on the road . 
   but `` fascism '' has been used to refer to a much broader range of things , including little more than `` authoritarian '' . 
  heh , in the '30s the communists referred to social democrats as `` social fascists '' : [ social fascism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_fascism ) ( < - this is what the communist international actually believed ), 
  actually if you read what you wrote you did n't specify any such thing there . 
  apparently now your argument boils down to that revolutionary catalonia was n't enforcing a dictatorship before it started doing that ( and in short order one might add ) . 
  which only seems to give support to gogoggk 's thesis that radicalism tends to end up like that - into a dictatorship enforcing the radicalism . 
   how did revolutionary catalonia , an anarcho-communist society , enforce a dictatorship ? 
  riiight , in a short time that develped into a real heaven on earth : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_catalonia#divisions_in_the_government_and_anarchist_movement  by 1938 the communist party was also in control of the newly created military investigation service . 
  the sim was virtually dominated by communist party members , allies and soviet agents such as aleksandr mikhailovich orlov and used as a tool of political repression . 
  [ 87 ] according to basque nationalist manuel de irujo , `` hundreds and thousands of citizens '' were prosecuted by sim tribunals and tortured in the sim 's secret prisons . 
  [ 88 ] repression by the sim as well as decrees which eroded catalan autonomy by nationalizing the catalan war industry , ports and courts caused widespread discontent in catalonia amongst all social classes . 
  relations worsened between the generalitat and the central government of negr\u00edn , now based in barcelona with the resignation of jaime aiguad\u00e9 , representative of the republican left of catalonia ( erc ) party in the government and manuel de irujo , the basque nationalist minister . 
  [ 89 ] there was now widespread hostility amongst republicans , catalans , basques and socialists towards the negrin government . 
  as the communists were forced to rely more and more on their dominance of the military and police , morale declined at the front as countless dissenting anarchists , republicans and socialists were arrested or shot by commissars and sim agents . 
  speaking of russia 's aerospace industry : [ $ 1.8 billion disappears in russian space program ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/25/technology/russia-space-corruption/index.html )  russia 's space industry is in crisis caused by funding cuts , corruption and `` moral decay , '' government officials said . 
   billions of rubles have been lost in shady transactions . 
  construction projects are languishing . 
  and important launches are failing . 
   in 2014 alone , federal space agency roscosmos committed 92 billion rubles ( $ 1.8 billion ) worth of financial violations , according to russia 's public spending watchdog agency . 
  ^ that and it has great performances by great actors too . 
  no wonder awards and accolades were raining on them : [ list of awards and nominations received by the king 's speech ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_king%27s_speech ), 
   no that is what they should be , but they are n't necessarily . 
  here is an open letter to hrw which mentions more conflicts of interest . 
  there certainly are good reasons to keep an watchful eye on potential or actual conflicts of interests . 
  and i 'm sure there does n't exist a human organization on this planet that does not warrant critisism . 
  but the letter you linked to seems a bit confusing at parts , for example this :  in a 2012 letter to president ch\u00e1vez , hrw criticized ** the country 's candidacy ** for the un human rights council , alleging that venezuela had fallen `` far short of acceptable standards '' and questioning its `` ability to serve as a credible voice on human rights . '', 
  ** at no point has u.s. membership ** in the same council merited censure from hrw , despite washington 's secret , global assassination program , its preservation of renditions , and its illegal detention of individuals at guant\u00e1namo bay . 
  ( bolding mine ) that is a strange thing to claim because actually the hrw did critisise the us on the human rights issues when they were a candidate to the un-hrc . 
  seems the writers are requiring that critisism towards a candidate ( in this case venezuela ) has merit only if at the same time a letter is sent to all the countries which already are members to critisise their membership once again ( such as the us , china , russia etc ) . 
  oh , and the hrw does critisise also the us even as it 's currently a member of the un-hrc , for example this latest from 2015 : http://www.allgov.com/news/us-and-the-world/human-rights-watch-calls-united-states-strong-on-process-and-short-on-substance?news=856435 for some reason the writers are also ignoring that not only did the hrw critisise some of the un-hrc candidates on human rights issues ( including the us ) but also critised the whole candidacy process ( when it was designed ) which makes it possible for countries with human rights violations to become not only candidates but also members . 
  their critisism did not lead to redesign of the process and it is what it is . 
   so you can try to pretend that i am a `` conspiracy nut '' , but harvard , ny university professors agree with me that hrw should solve its revolving door problem . 
  so this is n't some conspiracy but an actual problem of an actual ngo . 
  well , some of your claims did sound very much like what conspiratards tend to throw around , such as your far-fetched claims of family ties as if they have been consequential for a secret agenda of the transparency international yet kept succesfully hidden . 
  but yes , i do agree that the hrw should check their revolving door problem if they have one . 
  and i do believe the hrw deserves critisism as any human organization does . 
  but say , do * you * find that letter as an objective asessment ? 
  because to me it seems to resort to cherry-picking and even ignoring some relevant things to promote its agenda - is that something we should just ignore or something to `` be aware off '' ? 
   so you agree or disagree with euronews and radio liberty 's definition of lviv as a nationalist stronghold , yes or no ? 
  while i 'm sure there are people with nationalist sentiments in lviv i do not agree with ` stronghold ' as a definition . 
  and i agree with your silly ` hyper nationalist ' even less . 
  neither of those has any specific meaning . 
  for example , how nationalistic exactly is ` hyper nationalist ' ? 
  what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  like i already said it has no specific meaning outside of your head , and that is why i questioned your usage of it mixed in with your attempt of an analysis . 
   well we have to take another poll and ask 1000 ukrainians `` what is the most nationalist city in ukraine ? '', 
    i 'm willing to bet the answer will be undoubtedly lyiv or hey better still since you probably think i 'm admittedly partisan over ukraine what western media has to say about the place and area . 
  so now you 're resorting to * imagining * the data . 
  in your * imagination * there 's the data , and that is all you need , so there . 
  thanks for the good laughs . 
  this is getting funnier by reply . 
  :d  i 'm not going to wast my time arguing the semantics of it while you continue shouting ` where are the proofs ' no , i 'm not ` shouting ' - albeit i * am * laughing . 
  nor have i said anything about ` the proofs ' . 
  you 're merely imagining things again . 
   people should start to understand that ngos are n't necessarily what they appear to be . 
  yeah , wake up sheeple !, 
   it 's a hmr employee who describes that it is `` strange '' for him to assess the `` conduct of the war '' since he used to be a us intelligence officer involved in the target selection for pgms . 
   hrws is n't really what it appears to be . 
  [ citation needed ]  partly , i guess , but from the people involved ( bertelsmann stiftung , economist intelligence unit , wef [ the davos boys ] ) in their cpi , they might just also be about deregulation . 
  or it might be about aliens . 
  it * might * be just about anything , yet we do know it * is * about transparency and corruption .
