   the cpi was invented by a prof. johann graf lambsdorff ( i do n't think he is any longer involved ) , who 's family is well known in germany for their roles in the fdp ( a pretty much purely deregulate everything party ) . 
  ah , the real smoking gun right there . 
   people should be aware that ngos have an agenda , too ; that is pretty much common knowledge as that is exactly what the ngos are for . 
  to have their agendas and to promote them whether it 's human rights , free trade , gender equality or ultra conservative family values - that 's what they 're for . 
  and that is also why they 're important to civic society in a functional democracy . 
   when you gather around to do it nearly every weekend ( which seems top be the case ) it kinda is . 
  ah , it ` kinda is ' . 
  weasel words are always helpful . 
   their complete faith in government media compared to the rest of the country only emphasizes this and the data backs me on this one . 
  or it 's just your confirmation bias at work . 
  in reality you do n't have the data to back up your silly moniker of ` hyper nationalist ' which does n't even have any specific meaning outside of your head . 
   i do n't know why you are so confrontational about it i am merely questioning you adding your completely subjective and irrational monikers in a simple name of a city . 
  then you even pretend not to know what to call a city . 
  well , go ahead then . 
  make my day . 
   i do n't know what else you would call it you do n't know what to call lviv ? 
  how about calling it lviv . 
  the survey you posted calls it lviv .

   critics have also pointed out that ai was used in propagating disinformation with a press release before the 1991 gulf war , in which it claimed that iraqi soldiers were responsible for the deaths of `` scores of civilians , including newborn babies , who died as a direct result of their forced removal from life-support machines . 
  '' ** [ citation needed ] ** it later transpired that this claim was untrue , and ai 's press release was used in the opening salvo of this propaganda campaign -- u.s. president george h. w. bush showed ai 's press release on a prime time interview . 
  prof. francis boyle , an ai usa director at the time , gives a detailed insider account of the way the ai press release was handled . 
  [ 15 ] the normal process of double-checking and consultation was short-circuited in a rush to issue the press release . 
  ** [ citation needed ] ** in an april 1991 statement , ai said that although its team was shown alleged mass graves of babies , it was not established how they had died and the team found no reliable evidence that iraqi forces had caused the deaths of babies by removing them or ordering their removal from incubators .

   the hyper nationalist cities like lviv are totally in love great analytic style you got there son .

  sure i 'd welcome ukraine to the eu . 
  but it will take time for ukraine to reform and fulfill the copenhagen criteria . 
  i 'd say a full membership would be least 10-15 years away , more likely 15-20 . 
  i 'd support that !, 
  spotted today some f-18s , gripens and mirage 2000s drilling here in northern finland . 
  not sure but they were probably conducting air-to-air interception drills with some low level flying between the fells . 
  no shooting but plenty of flares . 
  edit : anyone here from bod\u00f8 ? 
  must be busy over there . 
  and that is relevant because ? 
  are you implying those monies simply went to [ amnesty international russia ] ( http://amnesty.org.ru/ ) ? 
  because i certainly do n't think so .

  makes me wonder what are all those candles made of ? 
  or , it 's a misleading article not worth dismantling the eu over ? 
   you could make a constructive argument against my comment telling why do you think i was wrong and i would listen but your comment does not have any actual arguments backed up by facts . 
  it reads as a simple rant and the rational thing to do is simply dismiss it as such - with laughter or not , does n't matter . 
  while i know you 're joking that is not an option for finland . 
  but it is an option for sweden : if finland joins nato then sweden not joining is indeed a valid option for them . 
  however , if sweden joins nato then finland 's only reasonable option is to follow suit and join too . 
   maybe the greek swap was the biggest , illegal and the most disastrous goldman sachs did nothing illegal . 
  there was nothing illegal in them making a loan swap . 
   but the real problem is that eurostat knew that . 
  only by your 20/20 hindsight can you claim that anyone else * knew * that . 
  yes , some did suspect that the greek gov was cooking their books but actually * knowing * it would have needed the actual evidence which was unavailable . 
   do you have a problem with russia funding politics in europe ? 
  funding political parties is not the same as funding civic society ngos . 
  viktor yanukovych was a different guy and certainly not a reformer . 
  president leonid kuchma appointed viktor yushchenko , a known reformist , as the prime minister in december 1999 . 
  he proceeded with economic reforms and ukraine 's economy improved . 
  unfortunately some of yushchenko 's reform policies were poison to oligarchy , especially to donbass coal and gas magnates , and before long his reform policies were cut short as the communists and parliamentary groups related to oligarchs successfully managed to give his cabinet a no-confidence vote . 
  in may 2001 he was replaced as the prime minister by anatoliy kinakh , the chairman of the party of industrialists , who got later dismissed by the prez kuchma for not pursuing reforms . 
  yet even that short period of economic reform policies by yushchenko had a notable positive impact on the economy as also seen on the graph . 
  unfortunately it was too little . 
   the prime minister got a mansion equipped by foundation run by industralists for that . 
  viktor yanukovych became the prime minister in 2002 and got one building in the area as his residence in the office . 
  at the time the mansion seen in those photos did n't exist yet . 
  later on he obtained more buidings through opaque ownership schemes and had that luxurious ` club house ' built . 
   old rules can still be inconsistently applied by courts . 
  yes , the complex and self-conflicting soviet legacy code - which is impossible not to break in some way or another - has been a problem and signifies the mistakes made already in the '90s . 
  the first president leonid kravchuk was a former communist apparatchik and he did not pursue reforming the country , economy or civic society . 
  to the contrary he went on centralising his powers and tried to run the country and its economy as a small soviet union . 
  his rule left a lasting impact on the power structures and institutions and reforms were proven very difficult later on , relevant quote from the 2013 assessment : * ukraine has made almost every mistake imaginable in its institutional design . 
  in the 1990s , it built ministries that recreated bad habits of the soviet command economy . 
  prosecutors , tax police , and the former kgb were given too much power . 
  kuchma also expanded presidential authority but used it to act as the oligarchs ' patron . 
  * that led to the lack of rule of law : * the law in ukraine is deliberately capricious and its application arbitrary . 
  because the population must constantly break the law , authorities can decide whom to prosecute , and they wield this authority to consolidate power . 
  punishment is used to disable anyone who challenges the system ; forgiveness is used as patronage . 
  most judges are holdovers from the communist era and continue to respond to instructions from officials . 
  conviction rates top 99 percent . 
  reforms passed in 2010 have increased executive control over the judiciary . 
  yanukovych created two new courts to bypass relatively independent ones and he purged the supreme court and constitutional court . 
  other executive bodies gained control over judicial appointments . 
  the ease with which authorities launched political prosecutions in 2011 and 2012 -- most prominently against tymoshenko -- showed the new system 's weakness . 
  today , politicians routinely take bribes from oligarchs or are oligarchs themselves . 
  members of parliament are immune from prosecution , making public office a gravy train . 
  a place on an electoral list is estimated to cost $ 5 million in bribes to party leaders . 
  *  while poland was the first , ukraine was the last post-communist european state to liberalize its economy , even belarus was earlier . 
  yes , albeit i would argue that ukraine 's economy never was fully liberalized . 
  the opaque privatization process initiated by the second prez leonid kuchma favoured the oligarchy which gained even more economic power . 
  and as rule of law and institutions were as they were it was all the easier to turn that economic power directly into political one . 
  which then rendered reforms even more difficult . 
  but , i have to say , i am optimistic about the future . 
  both the president and parliament have already demonstrated not only their willingness but also their capability to make impactful reforms . 
  as one can see on the graph ukraine had pretty much only two short periods of economic reform . 
  the first was started in 1999 by prime minister viktor yushchenko . 
  the reforms boosted growth but at the same time enriched the oligarchs . 
  the second short period of reforms was started after the orange revolution in 2004 . 
  here 's a good primer on the economic developments in ukraine since the indepence : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ) ( 2013 ) and another informative assessment from 2012 : [ the underachiever : ukraine 's economy since 1991 ] ( http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/09/underachiever-ukraine-s-economy-since-1991# ) for more in-depth reading the library of congress has compiled an impressive list with relevant books and academic papers : [ economic development of the ukraine : a guide to selected information sources ] ( http://www.loc.gov/rr/business/ukraine/economy.html ), 
   why are we not funding this ?!, 
  not sure but i guess you could visit their nearest embassy and arrange to donate your monies for fake architecture .
