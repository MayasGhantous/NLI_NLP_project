   g8 is literally g7 + russia . 
  g7 + the eu nowadays . 
   you ca n't kick russia out of it . 
  it 's just a forum not an international organization with a membership treaty . 
  and as such you really can not get to be a member nor kicked out . 
  you 're just welcome to participate to the forum or not . 
   all you could do is dissolve g8 . 
  i do n't how that could be done as there 's nothing dissolvable here . 
   why is that ? 
  the atlantic has a great article about him : [ the oracle of ice hockey - how a 70-year-old finnish goalie coach is transforming a global sport ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/02/the-puck-stops-here/357579/ )  a bunch of half-cocked theories have emerged to explain how these finnish goaltenders came to be . 
  people i asked would cite everything from the welfare state to the stoic national character . 
  then i began to hear too about urpo yl\u00f6nen , the old man who lived on finland 's southwestern coast . 
  people who knew hockey and finland spoke of him the way jedis would talk about yoda or obi-wan kenobi . 
  that they referred to him simply as upi only added to the mystique . 
  heh , in 1991 he was signed as a player by \u00c4ss\u00e4t in the finnish liiga and was fired from the team immediately after he attacked a referee in his very first game . 
  yup . 
  happened in minsk last year at the semifinal game between russia and sweden close to the end of regulation . 
  russia was leading 3-1 . 
  russia 's head coach oleg znarok made threatening gestures to the swedish coaching staff , and the swedish assistant coach rikard gr\u00f6nborg responded in a poor manner . 
  here 's znarok 's throat cutting gesture : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2wvbnzcaow&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24s afterwards gr\u00f6nborg apologized , but znarok did n't saying he would do it again if he could . 
  then later on znarok backtracked claiming his gesture only signified he had `` a sore throat '' . 
  no , i 'm not kidding , he actually claimed that to an adult audience : https://youtu.be/1ieij2czsfs?t=1m53s it becomes even funnier considering how that guy had responded to a * joke * just a week before : [ today , kuznetsov jokingly aimed antiaircraft gun at russian coach znarok , who responded `` kid 's national team career is over '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/25qbrv/today_kuznetsov_jokingly_aimed_antiaircraft_gun/ ) anyway , after the incident both coaches got suspended : [ the iihf disciplinary panel has suspended coaches oleg znarok and rikard gronborg for the 2014 iihf world championship gold and bronze medal games respectively . 
  ] ( http://www.iihfworlds2014.com/en/news/znaroksuspension/ ) note this part : * as a result of the suspension znarok and gronborg will not be allowed to be involved with the team in any manner prior to or during the game . 
  this also includes any post-game ceremonies . 
  * yet in the final game between finland and russia there he was in the building using a radio to communicate with the team during the game : [ scandal ? 
  secret communication of olegs znaroks with russian bench during final match iihf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scomh1qav_u ) sportsmanship and that guy just do not mix . 
   canada was undefeated in the tournament . 
  thank you canada for sending such a great team . 
  from crosby 's leadership to burns ' smile it was an absolute joy to watch canada 's games in the tournament . 
   i feel really embarrassed for malkin , ovechkin , and the other russian players who stayed on the ice . 
  they actually did n't stay on the ice . 
  they just left about 30 secs later than others . 
  actually none of the russian players remained for the raising of flags and anthem . 
  they all had left the ice already before the closing speech and thank you 's by the iihf president ren\u00e9 fasel . 
  some players , such as ovechkin and malkin , remained on the ice a bit longer that others - standing there apparently confused where did everybody go before leaving too . 
  check this video of the full ceremony : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hevx-0opbq8, 
  very true . 
  i do n't know what their head coach was thinking . 
  indeed . 
  those who do n't follow hockey probably can not appreciate how important the elusive concept of * class * is for the game . 
  even if he 's bit exaggerating i think don cherry is onto something here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rywbls3buu * `` no class , no honour ... we stood twice when they won and they walked off the ice , they got no class whatsoever '' *, 
  tbf , i do n't think the russian team left the ice on purpose to demonstrate disrespect to the games or to canada . 
  i do believe there has been some sort of misunderstanding on their part but their conduct does show disregard of the closing ceremony of the games . 
  here 's a bird 's eye video of the full ceremony : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hevx-0opbq8 [ res ignored duplicate link ] for some reason in the middle of the closing ceremony ( at about 9:30 on the video ) a russian team official ( head coach ? ), 
  starts hailing the russian audience and waving goodbye , and the team starts to leave in an apparent confusion with only few players remaining a bit longer . 
  they were all gone before the closing speech & thank yous by the iihf president ren\u00e9 fasel , raising of the flags ( canada 's , russia 's , and usa 's ) and canada 's anthem . 
  i also think the person ultimately responsible for their conduct is russia 's head coach . 
  heh , actually the russian sports minister has already hinted that it was the iihfs fault . 
  among others for example the iihf : [ russian hockey federation to be fined for team 's walkout on canadian anthem -- iihf ] ( http://tass.ru/en/sports/795279 ), 
  for finland check this site with good up-to-date info : http://www.studyinfinland.fi/tuition_and_scholarships/tuition_fees * currently , no tuition fees are charged in regular degree programmes - regardless of your nationality * also , if you 're coming from outside the eu/eea , note this :  in october 2014 , the finnish government suggested that tuition fees might be introduced to non-eu/eea students from 2016 onwards . 
  however , the government later abandoned the plans , see the section recent news on this site . 
   update , may 2015 : after the april 2015 parliamentary elections , the new government has included the fee issue into their governmental programme suggestions - what this means exactly , remains yet to be seen . 
  we will of course post any updates on our site if/when they become available . 
  also the medal ceremony was a display of terrible sportsmanship by the russians : [ russian hockey federation to be fined for team 's walkout on canadian anthem -- iihf ] ( http://tass.ru/en/sports/795279 ) video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e3qrcqq7h0 respect for those few players that remained on ice such as ovechkin , malkin , tikhonov and kulikov . 
   lol those planes are pretty tiny one of the world 's biggest single-engined production biplanes with 12 passengers capacity . 
   every country had done horrific things in the past . 
  and i just told you one big difference very relevant here . 
  you simply chose to ignore it while repeating the same misplaced hyperbola of yours . 
  this is the point where i see there 's absolutely no point in discussing with you . 
   the article uses history as a method of attacking a country the article is critisising * putin 's present day view of history * not attacking a country . 
  if putin 's view of history is beoynd critisism for you then so be it . 
  others will likely disagree with that and critisise it - as the author has done . 
   that or the idiot who pawned shetland/hjaltland and the orkneys to the scots . 
  heh , [ the vexed question of the orkney and shetland isles ] ( http://alexmasterley.blogspot.fi/2012/01/vexed-question-of-orkeys-and-shetland.html )  i estimate that 58,000 rhenish guilders would be worth approximately # 1,392,000 in modern currency , but it would also be reasonable to charge a rate of interest on top of that sum . 
  assuming a real interest rate of 2.125 % , payable since the death of christian i in 1481 , that would give an outstanding balance # 98,348,595,286 . 
   only difference being earlier you pointed out that `` every country has done horrific things in the past '' as a misplaced hyperbola . 
  the big * difference * here is that many coutries have come to terms with the horrific things done in the past by recognising , apologizing and reconciling for them . 
  putin 's russia does the opposite by denying , rehabilitating and even glorifying such things . 
  and in my opinion writing about it is warranted . 
  which is apparently only allowed for mr. putin . 
  well , i obviously can not make you read the article . 
  the article is very much about the * present day * policies of putin . 
   ca n't we just focus on the present and look forwards to the future , not backwards to the past ? 
  if you read the article it actually is about the present : * vladimir putin has chosen to rehabilitate the molotov-ribbentrop pact as good foreign policy . 
  but why violate now what was for so long a soviet taboo ?

  did you even read your link ? 
  claiming that `` a provincial rail centre '' on a long disputed territory is the exact same thing as invading and occupying half of country and then proceeding to mass murder and deport the people living there - as the soviets did - is not only ignorant but simply insane . 
  the soviets started the mass murders and deportations in the countries and areas they invaded years before germany attacked . 
  germany 's barbarossa started summer 1941 . 
  the soviets started their mass murdering and deporting people in the countries they invaded right away already in 1939 ( e.g. 
  poland ) and 1940 ( e.g.
