  because it 's a quotation ? 
  graves do get reused . 
  but that is not the same as systematically erasing graveyards . 
  just as people do die everywhere but that is not the same as ethnic cleansing . 
  graves , memorials and graveyards are much more than that . 
  they are an important part of collective history , rememberance , and memory of people living there or having lived there in the past . 
  when a regime resorts to systematically destroying e.g. 
  graveyards the purpose is to eradicate that history , to erase those people from the collective memory and to make it look like they never had lived there . 
  it is an effort to erase history - and even living history . 
  the soviets did the same thing in regions they invaded from finland . 
  they bulldozed whole graveyeards to make it look like finns had never lived there , to erase that actual history . 
  the absurd short stories by [ daniil kharms . 
   what does that accomplish ? 
  by burning fuel the plane gets rid of excess weight before landing . 
  for an airbus 320-200 the maximum weights are ( there are many variables to these ) : max takeoff weight - 93.5 t max landing weight - 77.8 t see the difference ? 
  typically planes take off with a weight higher than the max landing weight . 
  that excess weight is fuel . 
  as the plane flies to its destination it burns fuel and its weight gets smaller before landing , and at the destination it wo n't be too heavy to land . 
  but if there 's an emergency or a technical glitch or something abnormal forcing the plane to return back to the airport it departed from it has n't had the time to burn off that excess weight . 
  and if the plane is heavier than the maximum landing weight it has to get rid of that weight either by burning fuel or by simply dumping it into air before landing . 
  and if a plane lands with more than its maximum allowed landing weight it may get structural damage or at worst even break apart . 
  and every overweight landing requires a thourough and time consuming inspection for any possible damage meaning the plane wo n't fly for days . 
  [ reportedly ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/tap_portugalin_kone_palasi_helsinkiin__kevensi_kuormaa_porvoon_ylla/7984056 ) the flight had an unspecified technical problem and burned fuel for about an hour to lose some load before landing back to helsinki . 
  and later on , probably after check-ups , the flight took off again to lisbon . 
   the force loyal to the ideals and testament of the martyrs , will fight to the end , to a national albanian state , free and clean . 
  wtf is that supposed to mean ? 
  free of what ? 
  and clean of what ? 
  also , there already is a national albanian state . 
   `` yeah ? 
  what 's in it for us ? '', 
  the southern gas corridor . 
  the already existing project in the making with billions of investment in greece and with pipelines such as the trans-anatolian and trans-adriatic pipelines . 
  the problem russia has with that project is that it hurts their gas monopoly . 
  hence , the russians have hurriedly promoted their new project turkish stream as a contender to the southern gas corridor in an effort to try and maintain their monopoly by bypassing the eu legislation . 
  which is strange sentiment as the alternative is discussed in the article : the southern gas corridor . 
  in fact the southern gas corridor , which includes pipelines such as trans-adriatic pipeline ( tap ) and trans-anatolian gas pipeline ( tanap ) , has been in the planning for about a decade now and many agreements regarding the project has already been made . 
  this new russian proposal turkish stream has been hurriedly promoted by russia as a contender to replace it because the southern gas corridor in it 's planned form would hurt russia 's gas monopolies . 
  the problem with the russia 's plan is that it probably breaks eu 's third energy package rules . 
  or more accurately , as long as it ends in turkey their turkish stream plan does not break any eu rules but continuing it to greece probably would . 
  that 's because nordic countries do n't have universal minimum wages . 
  in denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden collective bargaining contracts are used instead . 
  in that case the turkish stream pipeline will not be complete by december 2016 . 
  they 're saying they would start gas supplies to turkey in december 2016 . 
  that means they 're claiming to complete the first phase ( 16 bcm to turkey ) by then . 
  edit : yeah , let 's downvote facts , shall we , and hope they go away that way . 
   russia is building the turkish stream pipeline to be complete in december 2016 . 
  you actually believe this ? 
   but seriously , why ca n't they do both ? 
  gas demands in europe are skyrocketing . 
  only if by skyrocketing you mean a modest rise in demand by 2030 : [ the outlook for natural gas demand in europe ] ( https://www.oxfordenergy.org/2014/06/the-outlook-for-natural-gas-demand-in-europe-2/ )  a report published by the natural gas programme of the oxford institute for energy studies , concludes that european gas demand will not recover its 2010 level until about 2025 . 
  dr anouk honor\u00e9 has produced the most comprehensive independent study of european gas demand by country and by sector available in the public domain . 
  the scenarios show that ** natural gas demand in the 35 countries of the european region falls from 594 bcm in 2010 to 564 bcm in 2020 and then rises to 618 bcm in 2030 ** . 
  only 24 bcm in two decades may seem very pessimistic , but one must not forget the sharp decline that already happened in 2010-2013 . 
  focusing on the 2013-2030 period , then 88 bcm of additional gas consumed is expected . 
  before directly comparing results one should first know to what extent the methods are able to produce comparable results . 
  so , what were the methods in each of these surveys and especially what was the sample size and sample selection ? 
  it 's easy really : [ just learn this simple diagram by heart ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/supranational_european_bodies-en.png ) , 
  not sure if you 're joking but the uk is not in schengen . 
  yes , both . 
  the constitution says : * the national languages of finland are finnish and swedish . 
  * of course they 're also official languages as guaranteed by an act . 
  that 's because the game is on tv in finland . 
  mtv3 has paid for the rights to broadcast the games in finland and hence the iihf youtube-channel wo n't broadcast a competing stream . 
  the geoblocking is easy enough to circumvent , e.g. 
  : https://hola.org/ choose a country which does not broadcast the games on tv such as belgium , and have a blast laughing at the iihf commentators . 
  ... and watch some hockey : [ iihf worlds 2015 - finland vs slovenia - live ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_9jhxxtog4 ), 
   was n't soini supposed to get foreign ministry ? 
  too early to say . 
  speaking of technicalities :  it would stay in the constitution as ~ ~ an official ~ ~ ** a national ** language . 
   the soviets were trying to join a western coalition against germany actually soviet union wanted to join the axis but was not accepted . 
  as late as november 1940 molotov travelled to berlin to negotiate soviet union joining the tripartite pact . 
  but hitler stalled it as he was already planning to attack soviet union . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_axis_talks#molotov_travels_to_berlin  stalin sent molotov to berlin to negotiate the terms for the soviet union to join the axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact . 
  [ 55 ] molotov spent much of the trip to berlin searching his rail car for listening devices . 
  [ 56 ] molotov 's train arrived at 11:05 a.m. on november 12 . 
  [ 57 ] [ 58 ] it was a bad omen for success that von schulenberg , the architect of the meeting , was excluded . 
  [ 43 ] molotov was greeted by ribbentrop at the train station decorated with soviet and nazi flags above a large basket of flowers , with an orchestra playing the internationale for the first time since 1933 . 
  [ 59 ] after a brief breakfast , the talks started immediately that day at the schloss bellevue hotel . 
  [ 57 ] after the dissolution of the soviet union , a moscow journal published certain selected correspondence revealing that stalin was closely supervising molotov 's talks via telegram , but some of those telegrams remain unpublished . 
  ... among some . 
  as a leader of national coalition party stubb will get some other influential minister post such as foreign minister - albeit i think soini would like to have that one too . 
  also the related articles in the series are very good read , e.g : [ `` america has a simple ideology '' : how one of russia 's top us experts tries to explain america ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/5/4/8535963/russia-putin-america ), 
   finland is collateralised only related to greece 's second bailout package . 
  the bilateral loans of the first bailout package do not have collaterals , and i think it would be those loans that would get discussed in a proposal for a haircut . 
   he war 's highest-ranking american pow , u.s. major general william f. dean , [ 291 ] reported that most of the north korean cities and villages he saw were either rubble or snow-covered wastelands . 
  so , how many villages did he see ? 
  just watched an amazing documentary about filmmaking in tito 's yugoslavia : [ cinema komunisto ( trailer ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9k7hm1m54y ), 
   i would 've been very very surprised if finland had denied them entry . 
  indeed . 
  as both of those two persons had their visas in order , and as neither of those two persons is on the list denying their entry to the schengen area i too would have been surprised if their entry had been denied . 
  yes , i do know what that word means , thank you . 
  now how about the actual question ? 
   his actions are actually very rational . 
  ...  in this particular case , he 's just trolling and saying `` what are you gon na do about it ? '' . 
  and that is very rational because ? 
   to read a graph , ** your graph uses old data ** ** you pretending that 2013 is 2014 does not make it so ** ** i posted the latest data ** ** the actual 2014 figures ** ** that latest data shows that the gdp per capita has already surpassed the pre_crisis levels ** ** i have never met anyone as dense as you in reddit and that 's saying a lot ** ** vaya con dios **, 
  okay , looks like you 're just trolling . 
  simply no-one can honestly be that dense and actively ignore the actual source which clearly says the 30.96 figure is from 2013 . 
  and as for the 2014 figures i already posted them .
