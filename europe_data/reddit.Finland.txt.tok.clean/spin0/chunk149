  not much else to do as you keep ignoring them . 
  yet they clearly show that the gdp per capita has surpassed the pre-crisis levels , and that the gdp has surpassed or reached very close to pre-crisis levels depending on the method . 
  end of transmission . 
   ignore the text , and focus on the results in the graph . 
  why the hell would i ignore the text telling what the data actually is ? 
  `` the gross domestic product ( gdp ) in latvia was worth 30.96 billion us dollars ** in 2013 ** '' your link also tells that the data source is the world bank . 
  so lets see what the world bank says about it : http://data.worldbank.org/country/latvia  latvia gdp ( current us$ ) $ 30.96 billion ** 2013 ** there it is again : 30.96 in ** 2013 ** one more tiem : ** the latest data in your link is clearly from 2013 ** ** also the latest data in the graph is from 2013 ** it is only you who insists that the 2013 data is somehow magically transformed into 2014 data by a misleadingly labeled graph . 
   no , they are extrapolations of data focusing on cvs instead of cps . 
  there not literal calculations . 
  that was my point . 
  iow you had no point . 
   sigh , look at the graph right below it . 
  the latest data there is ** 2013 ** . 
  your link clearly says so : `` the gross domestic product ( gdp ) in latvia was worth 30.96 billion us dollars ** in 2013 ** . '', 
  that 30.96 is also the last figure in the graph . 
  so , according to your link gdp in 2013 : 30.96 billion the latest gdp figure in the graph : 30.96 billion which means the latest data in the graph is also from ** 2013 ** . 
   why do you insist on not looking at the actual graph i 'm linking to which contains the 2014 figures . 
  no , it does not . 
  the latest data in your link is from ** 2013 ** . 
   huh ? , those are n't calculation methods . 
  they indeed are . 
  if you want the actual formulas refer to relevant sources - wikipedia is a pretty decent starting point : * `` chain linking is a statistical method , defined by the organisation for economic co-operation and development as ... '' * ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chain_linking , see also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chained_volume_series ), 
   did you look at my graph ? , it shows the 2014 figures . 
  read the very first sentence in your link : `` the gross domestic product ( gdp ) in latvia was worth 30.96 billion us dollars ** in 2013 . 
  ** '' ( emphasis mine ) now is year 2015 and the 2014 figures are available . 
  i already linked and even copied them for you and everyone else to look at . 
  i do n't know what else i 'm supposed to do but please do stop posting old figures and pretending they 're the relevant ones . 
   what methods ? 
  those three commonly used ones i just posted . 
   any ppp calculation clearly shows it has n't :  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/gdp-per-capita * sigh * `` the gross domestic product per capita in latvia was last recorded at 8863.20 us dollars ** in 2013 . 
  ** '' ( emphasis mine ) why insist on using old data ? 
  please do take a look at the more recent data i just posted . 
  once again your graph ends at 2013 . 
  it is currently year ** 2015 ** and 2014 figures are available . 
  please do take a look at the more recent data i already linked .

  your graph ends at 2013 . 
  it is currently year 2015 , latvia 's economy has been growing , and has indeed reached the pre-crisis levels depending a bit on what indicators are being used . 
  for example , gdp per capita has already surpassed the pre-crisis levels .

  the reason you have n't seen auroras is not the lack of auroras but not knowing when to look . 
  even in helsinki there 's visible auroras few times a year when the solar cycle is close to the maximum as it currently is . 
   these photos exaggerate the view with very long exposure time . 
  well , as you can see from the stars the exposure time is some seconds at most . 
  while not very long the photos do show the auroras brighter and more colourful as they would be for a naked eye . 
   i do n't think you can see those kind of lights unless you go north of arctic circle . 
  actually you can . 
  i 'm currently at the arctic circle and tonight 's two substorms at about 22:00 and 1:00 were nothing short of spectacular . 
  especially the later display had very bright , crisp , fast dancing curtains all over the sky with green , pinkish , violet , and reddish colours . 
  yet the best auroras i 've ever seen were in turku 2003 & 2004 . 
  i 'm sure they were spectacular also elsewhere in southern finland . 
   can anyone explain this , if there are auroras in lithuania then there should be auroras here as well in stockholm ? 
  there have been auroras in stockholm too . 
  they do not specifically avoid that one spot . 
  while not as often as in the north but they do happen from time to time . 
  i do n't know where you 're getting that 1998 from but it 's not correct . 
  people often fail to see auroras because they do n't know when to look , and also light pollution makes them harder to see . 
  edit : for example , here 's an [ image of aurora on march 1 , 2015 in johanneshov , stockholm , sweden . 
  ] ( http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=109447 ) that was over two weeks ago . 
  last night 's geomagnetic storm was much stronger producing larger auroras also in stockholm . 
   it 's obvious that for a party to rise so quickly it has to tap into sleeping electorate . 
  do you have surveys showing that ? 
  because in the surveys i 've seen most ukip voters have previously voted tories , lib dem or labour ( e.g. 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/09/ukip-inflict-damage-tories-labour-election-survey-finds ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/more-than-half-ukip-voters-disenchanted-tories-ashcroft-poll ) ) . 
  but i 'm not sure how many have actually been sleeping voters . 
  well , while one could argue that too the article discusses phenomena that transcend the simple divisions and argues that it concerns all the main political parties :  it is for the most part the excesses and blind spots of contemporary liberalism . 
  ** the modern social and economic liberalism , that dominates all the main political parties ** , has produced an economically abandoned bottom third of the population with no real chance of ever gaining a share in prosperity ; and an even larger group who feel a vague sense of loss in today 's atomized society in which the stability of family and the identity of place and nation has been eroded . 
   ** ukip voters are a compound of those ignored , abandoned and laughed at by the metropolitan liberals who , despite some party differences , dominate our public and cultural life . 
  ** ukip certainly has a xenophobic fringe , and seems to have hoovered up most former bnp voters , but for the most part ukip voters are just socially conservative , economically and culturally marginalized people who do not recognize themselves in any of the main parties . 
  many of the same factors seem to apply to pegida in germany ; it is more of a single issue movement but that single issue is emblematic of the same alienation from high liberalism . 
   the gap that has opened up between the secular liberal baby boomer worldview that dominates our party , governmental and social institutions and the political and psychological intuitions of the ordinary citizen is the new cultural/class divide in britain . 
  that gap can be observed both in the left and right wing parties . 
  i said : ** that is not statistics . 
  when you actually gather relevant numerical data and organize it then you may have statistics . 
  what you have is anecdotal evidence at best , which is subject to personal biases such as confirmation bias , and then some rationalising added to it . 
  ** do you understand what the word statistics means ? 
  you claimed statistics . 
  well , you lied because what you are presenting is not statistics . 
   the question is : what `` leftwinger '' is there ? 
  - votes labour - opposes uk public schools - supports inviolability nhs - opposes trident - believes it is the state that must guarantee egality and similar opportunity to all social groups and classes - reads leftist paper - etc  if there is nothing specifically left-winger , why would you call him one ? 
  what else * should * he say to be a real `` left-winger '' to you ? 
  but what is it you see as not `` leftwinger '' in those ? 
  that is not statistics . 
  when you actually gather relevant numerical data and organize it then you may have statistics . 
  what you have is anecdotal evidence at best , which is subject to personal biases such as confirmation bias , and then some rationalising added to it . 
  your reasoning is similar to what people with various prejudices use in rationalising their attitudes such as : because this person is < insert ethnicity/social group/political leaning  he/she is more likely to < insert bad thing  . 
   it 's just statistics , using this terminology swings the balance of probability that way . 
   ...  but they should be scrutinised because the probability of them being a gd fan is increased compared to someone who does n't say those words . 
   ...  using statistics to gather information about people is never unreasonable . 
  statistics ? 
  can i see those statistics ? 
  what is it you see as not `` leftwinger '' in those ? 
   it 's not a simple question . 
  the accusation that someone is wrongfully accused of racism has connotation . 
  you ca n't pass it off as an innocent question .
