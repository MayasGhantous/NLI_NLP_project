  they never are . 
  sometimes only relevant snippets of those have been published as text - not the recordings themselves . 
  and those snippets have been published with the results in due time . 
  in some rare cases some snippets may have been leaked before the results , but that is very rare and as a breach of code of conduct may compromise the investigation . 
  also , it is important to keep in mind what the dutch safety board is investigating and what is the purpose of its investigation ( or actually [ the three investigations ] ( http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014 ) they have opened ) . 
  as per icao annex 13 the purpose of the investigation is :  a process conducted for the purpose of accident prevention which includes the gathering and analysis of information , the drawing of conclusions , including the determination of causes and , when appropriate , the making of safety recommendations . 
  apportioning blame , such as who shot the missile , is not the purpose of their investigation :  3.1 the sole objective of the investigation of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and incidents . 
  it is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame or liability . 
   . .  5.4.1 recommendation . -- any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability should be separate from any investigation conducted under the provisions of this annex . 
  for that purpose there is separate judicial investigations by dutch prosecutor office , by ukrainian prosecutor , and probably by others too . 
  therefore , do not expect the mh17 accident investigation report , preliminary or final , to contain much anything regarding whodunnit . 
  the whodunnit investigations are separate and handled by the appropriate judicial authorities . 
  for example , the dutch prosecutor office has opened an investigation for suspected 298 murders . 
  what i would like to re-read is putin 's op-ed regarding ukraine , his customs union ( or eurasian ) , and the eu emphasising the economic implications . 
  was that 2010 ? 
  seems like ages ago , because at the time he seemed to opionate that ukraine might as well join the eu in the future . 
  nope , have n't seen images of that . 
  but then again i never said they have provided photographic evidence of everything , did i ? 
  yet there has been plenty of photographic and documentary evidence of weapons of russian origin - including this particular case . 
  the crux of the discussion was : * `` but they show that you can have a decent vac that does the job with fairly low power . 
  '' * and indeed you can , and i provided another example of it . 
  you can have a 900w vacuum cleaner beating high powered competition when it 's designed and built well . 
  as for the cost . 
  yes , a vorwerk brand of home appliance costs more as that 's a high quality product . 
  besides being much more efficient it also has the benefit to last to your grandchildren . 
  that 's the point of the brand : a high quality product built to last . 
  some people see the value in that and are willing to invest to such product . 
  yet that does not mean a big brand manufacturer can not design and produce a reasonably priced vacuum cleaner . 
  in fact the high powered motors cost much * more * than lower powered ones . 
  and as the actual cleaning power is not decided by the motor power alone ( it 's a misleading marketing ploy ) consumer spends more money both for loose wattage and for electricity it consumes . 
  the misleading kw competition has been harming consumers and probably also producers .

   people will just hoover for twice as long . 
  nonsense . 
   ukraine has claimed a lot of things happening with russia , but little proof in the way of pictures or videos so far . 
  so far i have seen plenty of photographic evidence for a lot of things they 've said . 
  also for this particular case . 
  also please be careful with the word * proof * when you 're actually referring to * evidence * . 
  * proof * exists in mathemathics , in real world it may or may not be applicable depending on circumstances . 
  for example there is no such thing as ` scientifically proven ' . 
  * posts random irrelevant stuff * * becomes eurosceptic * yeah , that figures . 
   tldr : this is good for the consumers , really good . 
  i also believe it may be good for the ( quality ) producers as they can concentrate their effort on better design and actual cleaning efficiency instead of mere rather inconsequential wattage of a motor . 
   and then again , we do have finns who think finland is not a real country , and the soviets had the right to invade it ah , the finnish ` antifascists ' as they cloak themselves . 
  also check out the performance of [ vorwerk 900 w ] ( http://shop.vorwerk.de/media/koboldde_hauptprodukte/2013-04-etm-testmagazin-test-beutel-staubsauger.pdf ) . 
  albeit no dyson in that test . 
  are you a dog posting here ? 
  been there , done that . 
  - donald duck, 
  also welcomed by producers . 
  the misleading kw competition was getting out of hand already while harming consumers and probably also producers . 
  bsh group : [ new energy label for vacuum cleaners makes decision to buy easier ] ( http://www.bsh-group.de/presse/index.php?id=542&amp;amp;l=1 ) electrolux : [ electrolux supports new eu energy label for vacuum cleaners ] ( http://group.electrolux.com/en/electrolux-supports-new-eu-energy-label-for-vacuum-cleaners-15521/ ) bosch : [ bosch welcomes new energy labelling rules for vacuum cleaners ] ( http://www.bosch-home.co.uk/press-release-detail.html?pressrelease=bosch-welcomes-new-energy-labelling-rules-for-vacuum-cleaners~13093 ) as of 1 sept you can walk into a shop and choose a vacuum cleaner by it 's cleaning power not merely by motor power . 
   i 'm yet to see the math http://www.eceee.org/ecodesign/products/vacuum_cleaners/wd_cf25june2010, 
   it looks like something that should be public knowledge . 
  as per the regulation [ the eu energy label for vacuum cleaners ] ( http://www.bureauveritas.com/wps/wcm/connect/bv_com/group/home/about-us/our-business/cps/whats-new/bulletins/eu_energy_label_vaccum_cleaners ) will provide you the relevant information of product 's energy efficiency , average annual energy consumption , dust re-emission , and * cleaning performance * in an easy-to-read form . 
   not if it takes you double the time . 
  which assumption would be true if the power of the motor actually affected linearily to the time needed - which it actually does n't according to research . 
  having more efficient vacuum cleaners has a huge potential for savings in energy and also greenhouse gases . 
  while it is only natural that people who believe that the cleaning efficiency equals to the power of the motor would disagree with the regulation , that is actually not true . 
  instead : * cleaning efficiency is decided by the actual sucking power at the sucking end . 
  * that indeed often correlates with the power of the motor . 
  but you can easily have a better and more efficient vacuum cleaner even with less powerful motor when you design it better . 
  for example , take time to design a more efficient fan , or design a tube that does not produce as much friction etc. 
  in a poorly designed vacuum cleaner most of the motor 's power is lost and never appears as actual suction at the sucking end . 
  you can have the most powerful motor ever but with a poorly designed fan and with tube design that creates friction the actual sucking power may be inadequate - as is apparently the case with your appliance . 
  it is possible that you 're a victim of a cheap marketing trick ( ` more powerful motor , more efficient cleaning ' which is not true ) . 
  and that 's why it 's a very good idea to provide the relevant information of product 's energy efficiency , average annual energy consumption , dust re-emission , and cleaning performance in an easy-to-read form such as the [ eu energy label for vacuum cleaners ] ( http://www.bureauveritas.com/wps/wcm/connect/bv_com/group/home/about-us/our-business/cps/whats-new/bulletins/eu_energy_label_vaccum_cleaners ) . 
   the difference will be too insignificant to justify a regulation . 
  the difference equals to the annual electricity consumption of hungary . 
  would n't call that insignificant . 
   my 2000w siemens is struggling enough to get all the cat hair off fabric . 
  it 's not the power of the motor but the actual sucking power at the sucking end that counts in vacuum cleaning . 
  and that is a design issue . 
   and seed potatoes , [ `` the netherlands is the world 's major supplier of certified seed potatoes , with exports of some 700 000 tonnes a year . 
  '' ] ( http://www.fao.org/potato-2008/en/world/europe.html ) [ `` the netherlands is one of the largest exporters of potatoes to russia , supplying 17,600 tonnes of seed potatoes to the russian federation . 
  '' ] ( http://www.bordbia.ie/industry/manufacturers/insight/alerts/pages/russialiftsbanonseedpotatoimports.aspx?year=2014&amp;wk=20 ), 
  well , the stated reasoning has been the same as russia exempting baby formulas from their embargo : because russia does not produce much lactose-free dairy products and the products could be seen as a necessity for those affected . 
   moscows internal issues so , invading another country is just ` moscows internal issues ' ?

  +1 gold and +1 food on tiles worked by city 's workers . 
  if adjacent to a lake turns it into an inner sea . 
  the harm is that it would in breach of the code of conduct of the investigation . 
  there is an actual international agreement which defines how to proceed with the investigation . 
  and the investigation has also the atc recordings . 
  it would be in breach of the agreed upon code of conduct to publish them . 
  russia 's demand is nonsense . 
  the existing connection between helsinki and st.petersburg gets removed in your plan .

  the rumour is that he 's probably dead : http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2dqvlf/stateofukraine_growing_consensus_that_strelkov/ do n't know if true , but plausible considering first the reports of him getting wounded , then `` resigned '' without giving any public statement , and after that nothing has been heard of him - not even on the website where he used to post almost daily . 
  fortunately you 're not limited to only those two images i linked . 
  there 's a video and plenty of images of a btr-82a available for comparison . 
  and i already linked a thread where this matter is under discussion ( with more images to compare with ) . 
  but my choise between a btr-82a and ' i have no idea ' is resoundingly the 82a . 
  it 's btr-82a . 
  not ukrainian . 
  front firing port is not visible in both images for comparison . 
  and the left viewports look similar to me in both their size and location . 
  but as you already said that it 's not a btr-80a ( i agree ) and that it 's not even a 82-a ( i disagree ) , then * what * do you think it is ? 
  what is * your * best candidate for comparison ? 
  also camera angle and optics are different .
