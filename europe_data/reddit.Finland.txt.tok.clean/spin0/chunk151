  no improvement since then .

  [ you ca n't stump the trump volume 17 ( goodbye , guac merchant ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdkxju8wie4 ), 
  yeah , but they never go for the jugular in that lame sport . 
  you should see some of the election debates . 
  what you linked is a fake fight , not real . 
  no real blood , nothing . 
  idiot . 
  you obviously have n't seen any or the actual debates where things get real and one one-liner can kill . 
  yup . 
  he will be a great president . 
  he will need a great administration of smart people but with his track record i have little doubt that he can form just that . 
  o5kar wtf , seriously ? 
  you linked to a clip and then falsely claimed it was about election . 
  lame . 
  hey , i 've seen that movie on finnish television decades ago . 
  was fun to watch . 
  occasionally i 've been trying to find it to watch it again - without success as i could n't remember even the name nor the country of origin . 
  now i know , thanks for reminding . 
  i have to say i had great fun watching the gop debate : it had passion , drama , humour , ( verbal ) action !, 
  great entertainment , and even as the event was rigged against trump he came out as the clear winner . 
  my sides obrbited when jeb bush made the mistake of bringing his * mother * into debate . 
  bush : look , i won the lottery when i was born 63 years ago , looked up , and i saw my mom . 
  my mom is the strongest woman i know . 
  trump : she should be running . 
   data showed euro zone industrial output fell 1 percent month-on-month in december for a 1.3 percent year-on-year fall . 
  that is bad news for finland and finnish exports which are by far mostly investement driven . 
  yeah but it 's 3 hours 27 minutes . 
  i mean , is n't there any concise version available with the key points consolidated to the youtube maximum length of 12 hours ? 
  link that and that people would have even less time to watch meaningless stuff on tv . 
  efficiency . 
   patriarch * triggered *, 
  yup . 
  i figured that much , and i know what you actually ment with your comment . 
  minister of the presidency maria marques : `` this is just a coincidence '' . 
  okay, 
   these two links say nothing tbh . 
  now that 's not very honest way to put it . 
   as for russia , their bonds are quite a hit , actually . 
  well , if you choose to call bond-sales that fail to reach target `` quite a hit '' .

  well that was not a very high energy video : he only mentions trump and sanders in passing . 
  anyway , i wish yanis the best of luck in his new interesting project .

  never mind the voting - there 's an obvious pattern regarding russia . 
   what happened ? 
  as the financial crisis hit the world economy and the oil prices collapsed russia and opec were to cut production . 
  but russia did not uphold its promises and grabbed market share instead . 
  here 's just a couple of related articles after a very quick googling : 2008 : [ russia volunteers to join an opec cut in oil output ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11oil.html ) 2009 : [ russia ramps up oil exports as opec cuts back ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/business/global/09opec.html ) and i do n't think opec will easily trust russia again this time . 
  can not agree more . 
  and we actually have more murkiness in europe , and the us has been much more active than the eu in the efforts of clearing that . 
  from finland * the * composer is jean sibelius : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_sibelius some of his major works are seven symphonies among many others from theatrical pieces to chorals and songs . 
  his major insprirations were nature , the finnish national epic kalevala , and nordic mythology - and under russian rule he helped in upholding and developing finnish national identity . 
  26 ( 1899 ) * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ) written as a protest against russification and related censorship , and as a result was often clandestinely performed under fake titles at the time . 
  and , knowing that history here 's my personal favourite rendition of finlandia hymn on youtube by the student chorus of the chinese university of hong kong performing it in finnish : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nahhjlhltk8 knowing the history of the hymn , and them performing it in finnish knowing what they sing about always leaves me speechless . 
  that 's what the song all about .

   the leaders of the united states and the european union are making a grievous error in thinking that president vladimir putin 's russia is a potential ally in the fight against the islamic state . 
  i do n't think much any leader sees it that way anymore . 
  if they had any mistaken hopes months ago they have probably faced the reality already . 
  for several months russia 's actions have been obvious : mostly bombing not isis but the syrian opposition as assad 's air force , and while at it bombing civilian targets such as hospitals , food production , water supply , and local textile industry among others - adding to the flow of refugees in the process . 
  such deal is very unlikely to beging with . 
  opec will not accept any deal where they potentially could lose market share , and the 2008-9 russian betrayal is hardly forgotten . 
  and rumours about a deal have mostly been from the most desperate sources such as the venezuelan gov - which just recently failed to woo support to their idea . 
  finally . 
  an important milestone indeed . 
  rollingstone , go home you 're stoned, 
  they probably think they weaken the eu . 
   the current muslim population of the uk is around 2 million . 
    the projected muslim population of the uk in 2039 is unknown but on the current trend i 'd expected to be around 3.5 million it 's over three million already ( 3,114,992 ) : [ number of uk muslims exceeds three million for first time ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/12132641/number-of-uk-muslims-exceeds-three-million-for-first-time.html ) * in some parts of london almost half the population are now muslims *, 
   the worse thing is that the left actions have silenced voices of arabic/asian progressives inside muslim communities , the voices of those who fight extremism from the inside , everyday . 
  the left is absolutely silent when it comes to their struggle . 
  these people struggling are often women by the way . 
  indeed . 
  a poignant example of that is the recent open letter to labour leader jeremy corbyn from the muslim women 's network uk . 
  they say discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it . 
  [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to jeremy corbyn .

   the russian public holds mr. stoltenberg in low regard for his clumsy and unprofessional response to the mass slaughter of children by anders breivik in 2011 in norway when 77 people were killed and more than 150 wounded . 
  at the time of breivik 's terrorist attacks mr. stoltenberg served as norway ' s prime minister . 
  wut i do n't know what that paragraph is supposed to mean nor how it 's relevant . 
  are there actually any surveys investigating russian public perception on how the norwegian pm handled the aftermath of ut\u00f8ya massacre ? 
  or is the writer just making stuff up ? 
  looks like it 's a stony meteorite but from the low-res pic it 's hard to tell whether it 's an achondrite or a chondrite . 
  do you know if there 's high-res pics available ? 
  no , i did n't say you do n't get statistics , i said you seem to have problems with understanding words and simple math . 
   seriously ?
