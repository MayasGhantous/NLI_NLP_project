  arguably it has also led to more people dying on the sea . 
  i believe in the netherlands it 's mostly caused by the numerous greenhouses . 
  i 've always wondered why is it considered economical for greenhouses to light up the sky instead of projecting the light on to the plants . 
  if the greenhouse glasses were made semitransparent , or if there was an electronic system to turn them into mirrors at will , then the ceiling would reflect all the light back into the greenhouse instead of leaking it to the sky . 
  and as a result the plants would get more light with less lamps and with less electricity . 
  but apparently there must be a flaw in my thinking as in reality lighting up the sky seems to be the way to go . 
  can anyone familiar with greenhouses shed some light on what is wrong with my idea ? 
  why is it not being done ? 
  i do n't have the stats from austria , but here 's a related research paper by institute of criminology and legal policy in finland : http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf compared to native finns the crime rate of rape is 13 times higher by men immigrated from middle-east or north-africa ( mena ) . 
  and that is after accounting for sociodemografic factors such as age , income , and housing - those factors do not explain the fact that immigrants from those regions are far more likely to commit rape than native finns or immigrants from other parts of the world . 
  in 2012 third of all rape convictics in finland were of foreign origin and in aggravated rape 41 % which is alarmingly high considering their small percentage of population . 
  so , at least in finland it is a fact supported by data that males from mena are far more likely to commit rape than males from other parts of the world . 
   i am confused . 
  i thought the right is in charge of the country ? 
  they may be but they 're not running the labour party . 
  the muslim women 's network uk says discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it . 
  [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to the labour leader jeremy corbyn . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xfvnqc6.jpg ) i do n't think problem in labour party is something other parties should be fixing . 
  i think that task should fall onto the left in uk , and fairly so . 
  the discrimination reported in the article has been going on in the labour party and it is only approriate to call out the left in the uk on that . 
  the muslim women 's network uk says that such discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it : [ women 's rights organisation says muslim women ` blocked from seeking office by male labour councillors ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/leading-womens-rights-organisation-says-muslim-women-blocked-from-seeking-office-by-male-labour-a6857096.html ) * muslim women 's network say the national labour party is ` complicit ' in local male muslim councillors ' ` systematic misogyny ' * edit : [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to the labour leader jeremy corbyn . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xfvnqc6.jpg ) so , if not the left in the uk then who is it that is supposed to fix that issue within labour ? 
   why does everyone go for the nazi camp thing on this sub i never suggested anything of the sort and do n't act like i 'd even consider it . 
  i did n't say anything about nazi camps and i do n't know why you choose pretend that i did . 
  i think establishing nazi camps in europe would be a bad idea , and i would not support nazi camps even if someone proposed them . 
   at the end of the day i was arguing that integration should n't be solely down to the individual but also encourage by society and the government . 
  yes , i very much agree with that . 
  but is n't that being done already ? 
  i mean at least over here there 's language courses and other relevant education readily available - and i 've worked as a teacher on such courses myself . 
  yet even with the assistance and opportunity provided by the society there will always be those who are not willing to actually integrate , and choose to see the values of the society they have migrated into , such as egality , as abhorrent or even blashemous . 
  and then they try to rule other people around them by imposing their own incompatible set of rules and values , which leads to blatant wrongdoings described in the op or even worse [ to things like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a3alral.jpg ) . 
  in such cases i do n't think the problem is lack of assistance integrating but the unwillingness to integrate . 
  as the old idiom says , you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink . 
  so far the law-enforcement has done pretty good job in finland , and they managed the events of the new year 's eve pretty well - at least if compared to what happened in cologne . 
  on the new year 's eve the police was warned beforehand about a planned mass-gathering of asylym seekers in helsinki and the police was prepared accordingly . 
  still the number of sexual assaults in helsinki that night was high and police received reports of one rape , two attempted rapes , and 12 other sexual harrassment cases . 
  now there are reports that there will be another planned mass-gathering of asylym seekers in helsinki tomorrow night . 
  there has been messages circulating in the social media and asylym centers calling for gathering at the center of helsinki on saturday evening at eight o'clock . 
  the police has prepared by doubling their presence . 
  yle report : http://yle.fi/uutiset/poliisi_vahvistaa_joukkojaan_helsingissa_lauantaina__uudenvuoden_tapahtumat_voivat_toistua/8653250 google translation : [ police to strengthen its forces in helsinki on saturday - `` new year 's events could happen again '' ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fyle.fi%2fuutiset%2fpoliisi_vahvistaa_joukkojaan_helsingissa_lauantaina__uudenvuoden_tapahtumat_voivat_toistua%2f8653250&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  how do you propose the society should help integrating those who do n't want to ? 
  some sort of forced integration ? 
  re-education camps ? 
  or what ? 
  having a special open doors day is not the best way to conduct such pr campaign . 
  churches and synagogues are open to everyone and anyone can visit . 
  declaring a special day when mosques are open to public might be counterproductive : the message can be perceived as the opposite of openness as if mosques are n't normally open to public but need a special day for that . 
  instead of a special day a better way to do such pr would be to have a longer campaign , at least a week or preferably much longer with the message : welcome any day . 
  the same thing as always - try to take over the world !, 
  you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink . 
  of course the society can provide assistance and opportunity to better integrate , but should n't integration be first and foremost individual 's own responsibility . 
   why just the left ? 
  the reported discrimination based on systematic misogyny happened within labour - a leftist party which at the same time chooses to boast about their record in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates . 
  edit : the muslim women 's network uk says discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it . 
  [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to the labour leader jeremy corbyn . 
  assad and russian bombs . 
  could you please name the criteria that cyprus did not fulfill ? 
  because i 'm not aware of any . 
  what a speech , i actually burst into a spontaneus applause . 
  estonia , i 'm jealous of your ability to produce true statesman-kaliber politicians - first lennart meri and now toomas hendrik ilves . 
   like usa never supported terrorists or gave them weapons i do n't think the us was supporting those guys . 
  yup , he 's the guy who wrote some of the biggest lies about 9/11 . 
  basically , whenever something notable happens that guy lies about what happened . 
  a liar by trade . 
  apparenty the term does not originate from the colour of the paper but possibly the colour of ink or a popular comic * the yellow kid * : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow_journalism#origins:_pulitzer_vs._hearst, 
  yeah , seems that has become more and more common , yet that is an unfortunate usage of the word tabloid as print size has little to do with content or editorial policy . 
  the term you 're looking for is * yellow press * . 
  well , being a tabloid does not tell you how good or bad a news outlet is . 
  for example , all finnish leading newspapers are tabloids - yet that does not mean they 're unreliable or anything like for example the daily mirror . 
  i think having a grudge over what happened in 2008-9 might be more relevant , and left saudi arabia with little reason to trust russia . 
   six opec countries , russia agree to hold emergency meeting the problem with the claim `` six opec countries '' is the exceedingly short list of countries provided which has only five countries named ( venezuela , iran , russia , oman , iraq ) and of which only three actually are opec members ( venezuela , iran , iraq ) . 
  could you parse your comment ? 
  i do n't know what `` news part coems from oben '' is . 
  additionally , he very specifically talks about government agenda . 
   there are many , many media outlets out there which report precisely and passionately and refuse to be intimidated . 
  they are viewed , listened to and read . 
  you could start to list examples in germany here -- the primetime heute-journal news on public broadcaster zdf , the s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspapers , for example -- but the list could go on and on and would never be complete . 
  i find it surprising the editorial does not even mention what the former director of zdf bonn wolfgang herles just recently said in a radio interview : that the public broadcaster zdf 's reporting - what to report , how to report and what not to report - is set by government agenda . 
  he calls it scandalous , and that such pro-government journalism leads to people losing their trust in journalists . 
  here 's the relevant part of the interview with english translation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8kdqkp0q6q i find his comments especially interesting considering how vocal germany has been in bashing poland . 
  i spotted the story on / r/journalism yesterday : https://www.reddit.com/r/journalism/comments/43xq6m/former_head_of_germanys_zdf_admits_national_news/ also yesterday there was a number of english language reports on this but today they do n't seem to appear on my google search any more for some reason . 
  today google says some search results have been omitted . 
  which is a bit strange coincidence . 
   us did start to destabilize that region way back when they wanted to end ussr by funding independent rebels it was actually the ussr that invaded afganistan starting the war there . 
  and if that 's not destabilizing then i do n't know what is . 
  yet the history of violence in the middle east region goes far further back than that . 
   the whole destabilization of the middle east ( geography lesson here , libya is n't the middle east ) is the consequence of the us led invasion of iraq . 
  right , nothing happened in the middle east before 2003 ... 
  must have been a die-hard fan . 
   its already accepted that immigrants do n't take your jobs indeed they mostly wo n't as only 10 % might get a job in the first year :  the integration of refugees in the german labor market will be a lengthy process . 
  of which go from the federal labour agency , so scheele . 
  ** `` we should not have too high expectations . 
  if things go well , maybe ten percent in the first year after entry have a job after five years is the half , after 15 years 70 percent . 
  ** `` the local workers would need in the foreseeable future no competition by the refugees to fear . 
  `` for her aufholweg is much too long , '' said scheele . 
  but scheele acknowledged that refugees with local long-term unemployed could compete for jobs . 
  that could be so in individual cases if no specific qualification is required . 
  source , frankfurter allgemeine : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/fluechtlinge-kosten-deutschland-bis-2017-rund-50-mrd-euro-14045355.html  immigrants do n't help or worsen economy in any direction i do n't know how adding long term unemployment by millions is good for the economy . 
  their reporting on this is correct . 
  promoting a special day may be counterproductive - as i already explained above .
