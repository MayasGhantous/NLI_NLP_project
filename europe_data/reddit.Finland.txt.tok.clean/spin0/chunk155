  how accommodating of you . 
  i did not `` heavily imply '' such . 
  and i quite clearly stated why i think the idea of promoting a special day is counterproductive . 
  just an observation , not an offer of a deep analysis . 
  and at least i 'm able to make observations without being rude . 
  never ceases to amaze me how * rude * self-righteous people tend to be . 
  i do n't know how stating something positive about churches and synagogas is something `` very negative '' to you . 
  but to each their own i guess . 
   no need to turn this gesture of goodwill into muslim bashing . 
  seriously ? 
  you accuse me of `` muslim bashing '' . 
  now that is an awful accusation indeed . 
  perhaps you could actually point out where exactly have i done that ? 
   how to act morally pretty simple really : help people where they need help . 
  you can help many many many more people that way compared to importing them while exposing them to risks of journey such as exploitation and death . 
  also , declining an asylym is not always immoral . 
  just for one notable example france granted an asylym to ruhollah m\u016bsavi khomeini who then went on to declare himself the supreme leader torturing and murdering thousands of the very people who actually made the revolution happen . 
  would have been more moral if france had simply put him into a guillotine . 
  also , war is not always immoral . 
  sometimes fighting and winning is actually the moral thing to do . 
  after all , europe did not defeat nazism with mere notions of cultural relativism .

   download flash player now thanks but no thanks . 
  meanwhile , you can visit a church or a synagoga any day . 
  doors are open , and no special day is needed for heathens or pagans or whatever . 
  promoting a special day when people may visit is not a message of openess - to the contrary it 's a message of the very opposite as something mundane requires a special day . 
   1 ) which country are you from ? 
  finland . 
  born and lived here for nearly fifty years already . 
   2 ) what are the most and least reliable newsletters ? 
  what are their biases ? 
  perhaps you should not ask that on internet or social media such as reddit . 
  the first rule of the social media is : * never believe someone claiming something on the internet without providing the actual evidence needed to support their claim . 
  * people make all kinds of claims on the social media as it is exceedingly easy to do so . 
  most often those claims are entirely subjective opinions and without any conclusive evidence . 
  and if someone claims that someone else is bad or evil or liar , such as a media outlet , do not simply buy it without demanding actual evidence . 
  do not simply take someone 's word on it . 
  yet , as you ask , here 's evidence regarding the reliability of some leading news outlets in finland . 
  the relevant media watchdog in finland is the council for mass media cmm ( or julkisen sanan neuvosto , jsn in finnish ) . 
  here is their website for your perusal : http://www.jsn.fi/en/council_for_mass_media/the-council-for-mass-media-in-finland/ cmm is not a government or state organ but a board formed by selected journalists committed to advancing and upholding the ethical principles of the profession . 
  and they are indeed serious about it too . 
  here are their guidelines of good journalistic practice and ethics : http://www.jsn.fi/en/guidelines_for_journalists/ anyone can file a complaint to them requesting an investigation of a possible breach of professional practice or journalistic ethics they have spotted in media . 
  all their verdicts are available on their website : http://www.jsn.fi/paatokset/?year=2015 a verdict is either absolving ( vapauttava , green ) or condemning ( tuomitseva , red ) . 
  in 2015 all in all 84 complaints were investigated by the board and given a verdict . 
  here 's the number of verdicts regarding some of the most notable media outlets in finland . 
  | source | verdicts | absolving | condemning | notes | | : --------- | : -------- :| : --------- :| : ---------- :| : ------ | | yle | 11 | 6 | 5 | the public broadcasting company in finland | | helsingin sanomat | 8 | 4 | 4 | the leading finnish daily newspaper | | ilta-sanomat | 6 | 3 | 3 | the leading evening newspaper | | iltalehti | 3 | 1 | 2 | the competing evening newspaper | | suomen kuvalehti | 3 | 2 | 1 | the leading weekly news magazine notable for its investigative journalism | | hufvudstadsbladet | 4 | 0 | 4 | the leading swedish language daily newspaper in finland | and , what were those condemnations about ? 
  yle : 1x failure of truthful reporting 2x erroneous reporting and failure to provide timely correction 1x creating exceedingly negative publicity without hearing the individual at all 1x hidden advertizing and uncritical use of source helsingin sanomat : 2 x erroneous reporting and failure to provide timely correction 1 x breach of personal privacy 1 x hidden advertizing and uncritical use of source ilta-sanomat : 1 x erroneous reporting and failure to provide timely correction 2 x citating other people 's work without crediting iltalehti : 1 x erroneous reporting and failure to provide timely correction 1 x hidden advertizing suomen kuvalehti : 1 x failing to uphold the rights of an interviewee and failing to correct errors in an interview hufvudstadsbladet : 2 x erroneous reporting and failure to provide timely correction 1 x failure in information gathering and breaching the rights of an interviewee 1 x hidden advertizing based on that it would appear that the finnish public broadcasting company yle is the worst offender with the worst kind of breaches , and someone could deem it the most unreliable news source of those . 
  yet that would be an unfair conclusion . 
  it is also the biggest with the most branches and staff , and it is only to be expected that collectively they also make more errors . 
  that on itself does not render the whole yle or all its reporting as an unreliable source of news . 
  basically , most mainstream news outlets are reliable sources of news in finland , including many not included in the comparison . 
  we do also have some very unreliable news sources albeit marginal and very easy to tell . 
  for example , magneettimedia is exceedingly unreliable as you can tell by the [ holocaust denial on their frontpage ] ( http://magneettimedia.com/ ) . 
  for further information on media in finland i recommend these sources .

   shouldn t people have the freedom to move across different places/countries when they want to or for whatever reason ? 
  no , and there is no such human right . 
  personally , the only places i carry my guns with ammo are : shooting range , hunting grounds . 
  and those are also the only times it is legal to do that . 
  i would never even imagine carrying my guns and ammo to an amusement park hotel . 
  never . 
  but to you it 's entirely plausible to do so . 
  to me his explanation sounds not only implausible but idiotic . 
  yet to you it seems to be business as usual . 
  perhaps our difference of opinion is a difference of gun laws and cultures then . 
  you do know he was breaking the law , do you ? 
   with the handguns ? 
  yes , what was he attempting to do with the handguns and ammunition ? 
   as per the article text : yeah , that 's what i always do with my guns when between apartments . 
  i take my guns and ammo to disneyland . 
  is there anything that may sound a bit fishy with his claims to you ? 
  unique building : sauna , era classical +1 production from each worked forest tile +2 happiness ( +1 health in civ4 ), 
  turns out you can actually [ combine those two . 
  at chippendales ? 
  you do n't have to pay for the land . 
   then people caught some fishes - i did recognize northern pike and trout . 
  the fishes they have caught on the first page are graylings ( * thymallus thymallus * ) known for their [ large colourful dorsal fin ] ( http://www.wildernessfishing.com/wfi-web-d.jpg ) . 
  a tasty fish for frying , or even as salted in [ nordic gravlax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravlax ) style - just replace the dill with some white pepper . 
  and on the second page they have fished some arctic charrs ( * salvelinus alpinus * ) , the northernmost freshwater fish in the world . 
  [ they 're absolutely beautiful ] ( http://www.wilderness-tours.com/image/cache/data/fiskerejser_i_groenland/996576_462698510495816_1480887303_n-cropresize-690x450.jpg ) - and exceedingly delicious . 
  there 's quite nothing like hiking in the wilderness and catching one straight into the pan . 
   and i saw a dog inside the sauna in one of the pictures  yeah , some dogs do like sauna , and some do n't . 
  looks like it 's an individual preference . 
  the same goes with cats - albeit they mostly tend to like sauna only when there 's no people in there . 
  they mostly do n't seem to like people throwing water on the stones creating hissing noises and steam . 
  but they do enjoy it before and after people , a warm place to chill in peace . 
  and here 's a [ horse that * loves * sauna ] ( http://www.horsenation.com/2015/06/25/this-is-how-we-groom-horses-in-finland/ ) . 
  ( [ article with more images and video ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1434514787663 ) , contains nude people and probably nsfw for some ), 
   could you get a dui on one of those ? 
  you can if you 're steering the boat and your blood alcohol content is 1.0 \u2030 or more . 
  yes . 
  well then what was it he was attempting to do ? 
  greece is certainly the largest single route with 880 000 illegal border crossings by migrants in 2015 . 
  that 's 48 % of all illegal border crossings detected by frontex . 
  according to frontex in 2015 there were 1.83 million illegal border crossings detected at eu 's external borders . 
  of course , a number of those are by same migrants illegally crossing the external border at different locations . 
  meanwhile in sweden : in 2015 total number of asylym seekers 162877 of which iraqi asylym applications 20857 , number of asylym decisions 2797 of which granted 546 or 20 % of decisions . 
  and in finland : in 2015 total number of asylym seekers 32476 of which iraqi asylym applications 20485 , number of asylym decisions 3721 of which granted 626 or 17 % of decisions . 
  and of course , the percentage shares look different depending on whether one includes the dublin cases or written off applications . 
   conjecture incoming .
