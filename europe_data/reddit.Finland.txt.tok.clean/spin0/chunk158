  while there are many things that someone might argue to be taxed in the name of saving money that does not mean those ideas would get implemeted . 
  and the most vocal critics of introducing such new taxes would be the consumers and the businessess affected . 
  in finland there 's a tax on sweets , ice-cream , and sodas . 
  the arguments for that have been health benefits by steering consumption . 
  but it will be scrapped next year : [ tax on sweets and ice cream to be dropped ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/tax_on_sweets_and_ice_cream_to_be_dropped/8340402 ) there 's also high taxes on tobacco products and alcohol . 
  and the arguments for those are the health benefits producing savings in the public health care .

   would still insist on nationalized production sikorsky 's and agustawestland 's facilities in poland are not nationalized , and i very much doubt the polish gov has any plans to nationalize them . 
  do n't worry they will apologize for all that in 2516 .

   you can pretty much substitute any political ideology in there and it will hold up . 
  yet you did n't substitute with a political ideology . 
  `` right '' is not a political ideology and neither is `` left '' . 
   a political ideology ca n't change or is extremely lethargic about it . 
  but political parties and political groups do change . 
  and that is martin kettle 's point : he observes that the left , a political group , is turning into a church . 
  i for one suffer from europhobia . 
  it seems to be subconscious . 
  i consciously hope to get some euros , yet when i have them i seem to get rid of them as soon as possible as if driven by some sort of subconscious phobia . 
  and then i do n't have euros . 
  it 's a very unfortunate condition .

  well put :  this left of today looks to me suspiciously as if it is developing into another church . 
  this left too is marked by a reluctance to ask necessary but difficult questions about its plans for the world beyond the church walls . 
  this left too seems happiest as a fellowship of true believers , squabbling among itself , dismissive of all those who remain sceptics or whose beliefs the elders find unacceptable . 
  just as the communists knew things deep down that they should have faced up to , so too does this left . 
  and then you could name it the gentle state police or gestapo . 
  russia made the deal about them using the thales damocles already in 2007 . 
  now eight years later * you * claim that russia still has n't it in service . 
  eight . 
  years . 
  i find that very hard to belive . 
  in fact i call your claim bullshit . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  horse shit . 
  absolute crap , and pretty much as stupid as it can get . 
  how the hell * you * honestly believe your own crap is beyond me and not my business . 
  you go on living your life as you choose . 
   at that time the sidewinder was even more state of the art than the thales target pod . 
  it was unique and not done before in contrast to target pods . 
  fine , you go on copying those old-timer sidewinders then . 
   you seem to have an agenda . 
  you seem to fail to grasp some very basic simple things about technology and how it is actually made . 
  look at your smartphone . 
  even if you disassebled it and learned how evey single part of it works , and even if you had the blueprints of every single part , and even the license to copy it you still would not be able to produce it . 
  because you can not produce the parts . 
  and the same as with your smartphone camera sensor goes with advanced military sensors . 
  you need the tech to produce those before you can actually produce those . 
  no , * you * produce the evidence for your extraordinary claim that russia first made a deal of buying the thales democles but then somehow did not choose to actually use it . 
  i find your claim very very curious . 
   russia did a 1:1 copy of the sidewinder as well , without producing a similar missiles before . 
  it is certainly possible . 
  yes , it 's certainly possible to create a copy of a first generation sidewinder with its simple tech and all . 
  now tell me how exactly do you `` copy '' the sensors of the thales democles ? 
  i mean even if you have the sensors , or even the blueprints down to the tiniest detail does not mean you 're magically able to * produce * anything resembling it . 
  can you produce the camera sensor in your smartphone ? 
  no , you ca n't . 
  you do n't even have the slightest idea what it would take to actually do it . 
  links two videos . 
  claims there is no such video . 
  look , i 'm done here . 
  if you want to go on believing russia actually produces modern systems then by all means feel free to do so . 
  and if you want to believe that the only modern sensor system russia licenced for it 's only modern fighter is n't even used then feel free to believe so . 
  okay , if you want to go on believing russia is actually producing such sensors then by all means . 
  that could peg the question why did n't they produce anything even close to that quality before , but i would n't bother you with any questions about reality . 
  nope , not gon na waste my time on yu any more . 
  if you can not distignuish between the tech producing the variable qulity bombing vids from awful to adequate you can not be helped . 
  in the videos . 
  except we can see them using it in syria . 
  assembling a product = / = producing every component, 
  so you 're claiming the su-34 does not use the thales democles pod ? 
  the pod which was purchased by russia in 2012 to be fitted in the su-34 ? 
  they are n't using it ? 
  please . 
  so you actually believe russia produces the sensors 100 % home grown ? 
  do you know what it means when you have no means to produce a hi-tech sensor which is under export ban ? 
  even if you have the licence to asseble the pod as a part of a earlier deal does not mean you 're able to actually produce it 100 % home grown . 
   built under russian license , meaning the technology is already transfered to the country . 
  good luck with producing those sensors in russia . 
   modern systems . 
  great . 
  good luck with that . 
   oh poor helsinki nah , there are operators other than teliasonera in helsinki , and you can switch your operator as quickly as your socks . 
  additionally there are other network companies than ericsson . 
  there already is a test 5g network under construction in oulu , and notably telia-sonera or ericsson are not in the consortium building it . 
  so maybe they 're afraid of competition ? 
  looks like that as per their announcement they do not dare to enter the 5g market in helsinki but choose to go for other markets first . 
  them building their 5g in two cities in 2018 is not that impressive announcement . 
   i 'd say russia would be better off with prioritizing the modernization of existing aircraft . 
  modernizing with what ? 
  the only modern fighter in russia 's inventory is the su-34 introduced in march 2014 . 
  and the only reason for its level of precision is the french built thales democles pod purchased by russia in 2012 to be fitted in the su-34 . 
  and now that is under the export ban . 
   on the other hand , the speed with which the armata program seems to be moving is a nice surprise .
