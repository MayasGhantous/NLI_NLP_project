  when accounting for that and matching different parts looks like 82a to me . 
  yep , it looks more like btr-82a .

   there is no way in hell ukraine has lost 10,000 troops indeed . 
  and if there really were 10,000 dead where are their families ? 
  and the claimed 10,000 dead would mean additional tens of thousands of wounded soldiers . 
  the hospitals would be filled over their capacity by now if that was true . 
  this video is bullshit . 
  in other news : [ mercenaries , extremists become major balkans export ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/mercenaries-extremists-become-major-balkans-export/26532364.html ), 
  yep , at least according to russian lifenews he 's backpedaling from his speech : https://twitter.com/lifenews_ru/status/500608057416503296  prime minister dpr : we have a lot of vehicles abandoned ukrainian army , hundreds of bmp and btr [ apcs ] in good condition just standing in a field yeah , the fertile fields are full of apcs . 
  he was merely confused about their origins . 
  super charged with booze and promiscuity . 
  checkmate , atheists !, 
  glorious russian science ftw . 
   i 'm not sure if 220 km/h really counts as high speed rail . 
  okay , there * are * [ different definitions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail#definitions ) for high-speed rail depending on context and who you ask . 
  here 's the eu definition :  the european union directive 96/48/ec , annex 1 defines high-speed rail as a set of three elements with precise criteria :  - infrastructure : track built specially for high-speed travel or specially upgraded for high-speed travel . 
  - maximum speed limit : minimum speed of 200 km/h ( 124 mph ) on lines specially built for high speed and 250 km/h ( 155 mph ) on existing lines which have been specially upgraded . 
  this must apply to at least one section of the line . 
  rolling stock must have a maximum speed of at least 200 km/h ( 124 mph ) to be considered high speed . 
  - operating conditions : rolling stock must be designed alongside its infrastructure for complete compatibility , safety and quality of service . 
  so yes , 220 km/h really counts as high-speed rail provided it fulfills the criteria . 
   `` proper '' high speed trains travel at 300 + km/h . 
  according to which definition ? 
  yeah , looks like it as he now seems to be backtracking from his statement or at least according to russian lifenews : https://twitter.com/lifenews_ru/status/500608057416503296  prime minister dpr : we have a lot of vehicles abandoned ukrainian army , hundreds of bmp and btr [ apcs ] in good condition just standing in a field riiiight , that must be it . 
  he was merely confused about their origins . 
  also masons . 
  the top comment nails it :  let 's hope the humanitarian shipment from moscow contains some badly-needed tin-foil hats ... 
  while i agree that it would be nice , i do n't think such tunnel/bridge would be feasible . 
  but tallinn-helsinki is . 
  there 's also existing high-speed connection between helsinki and st.petersburg : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allegro_%28train%29, 
  according to partial and paraphrased translations i 've seen he says they have received ( or are receiving ) from russia 120 military vehicles including apcs , 30 tanks and 1200 fighters that have been trained for four months in rostov , russia ( likely in the training camp which , according to russia , does n't exist ) . 
  edit : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28817347  mr zakharchenko , who became self-declared prime minister of the `` donetsk people 's republic '' ( dpr ) last week , is seen on a video posted on youtube addressing the region 's self-styled parliament . 
   `` i 'd like to give you some good news , '' he says . 
  `` at present , moving towards the corridor [ a link across the border into russia established by the rebels ] are ... 150 items of military hardware , 30 of which are tanks and the rest are infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers . '', 
   do you even comprehend how ridiculous you 're being ? 
  the mental loops you 're going through to support even the smallest claims of a government that has a proven history of lying ? 
  about the ` mental loops ' . 
  just happened to read a spot on comment over here : http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2dmxgs/this_may_have_been_asked_before_but_is_there/cjr1455  sorry , there 's really no compelling evidence either way , alas . 
   many of the first round of separatist leaders were allegedly russian citizens , but you 'd probably have to take their word for that . 
   there have been intercepted phone calls released by the ukraine government suggesting some of the rebels are reporting to russian military commanders , but those could be faked by any teenager . 
   there are numerous photos of grad rocket launchers and other russian military vehicles geo-located within ukraine , but those could easily be faked . 
   reporters have documented heavy weapons in separatist hands whose accompanying paperwork showed them as having very recently been in russian military stocks , but mumble mumble cia forgery duplicate serial numbers nazis , or something like that . 
   separatists have admitted receiving tanks from russia , but they might have been captured ukrainian ones from crimea that went into russia without anyone noticing , or they could just be a shared mass hallucination ; and why on earth should anyone trust a separatist , anyway ? 
   separatists have hinted very strongly to reporters that russia is providing them material aid , but they did so in russian , i think , so god only knows what they really meant . 
   reporters have allegedly witnessed russian military vehicles crossing the ukraine border into separatist-controlled areas , but we all know journalists never tell the truth . 
   several foreign governments have accused russia of arming the separatists , but all those pro-israeli nazi governments clearly ca n't be trusted to tell the truth , also syria , or maybe iraq , i forget what the whataboutism for this talking point is . 
   several dozen russian citizens , reportedly active-duty military personnel , died in the battle for donetsk airport , but for all we know the ukraine military kidnapped them and were using them as human shields or sex toys or something , because ruthless nazi sheep-buggerer war crimes junta . 
   there were photos of a russian buk supposedly just inside the russian border , then supposedly inside ukraine , then supposedly back inside russia again but missing a missile just after mh-17 was shot down by two ukrainian ground-attack aircraft , one of them invisible to radar , but that 's the easiest sort of photoshop trick there is , really . 
  ( the photos , not the invisible su-25 . 
  though i guess an invisible plane is pretty easy to photoshop too , come to think of it . ), 
   tl ; dr : baseless accusations , zionist conspiracy theories , nazi slander , unskilled fakery , syria , benghazi , photoshop . 
  really . 
  the markets calmed later on . 
  those graphs are from earlier today and do not show how it played out through the day . 
  about half of businesses said the sanctions affect them either directly or indirectly . 
   what about valio profit margins likely gets a near term hit . 
   and workers ?? 
  probably some layoffs ahead . 
  sucks for them . 
  there will be also secondary effects such as less demand for transport or packaging services . 
  sucks for them too . 
   oh got it well , you did n't . 
  i said no , valio is not going under . 
  two more from yesterday . 
  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bu14ywgicaaxkkb.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bvalsttigaa7op3.jpg, 
   official government announcement : that 's some pretty stupid ct shit right there . 
  russia 's stories get crazier and crazier by the hour now . 
  there 's not any logic whatsoever in their claims never mind the complete disregard of realities . 
   5 years ? 
  10 years ? 
  russia is n't the only market in the world . 
  in the long run companies will find other markets and diversify . 
  and if a company is unable to find a market for its products in 5-10 years i welcome it to go the way of dodo . 
  from finland 's economic point of view the real question is : * how badly is russia 's economy affected by the eu sanctions in the short term ? 
  * the current estimate is if russia 's economy shrinks by -3 % this year that would hit finland 's gdp by 0.5 % . 
  no , not really . 
   we 're trying to slip from common eu foreign policy . 
  finnish gov and prez niinist\u00f6 have been very clear that we 're with the eu here . 
   by thinking that we 're still independent and free to pursue finlandizierung v2 .0 . 
  have n't heard prez niinist\u00f6 promoting such policy . 
  in fact he has been quite clear that we 're with the eu here . 
  and he has also been clear about the reasons for the meeting and the agenda there ( not economy ) . 
  yes ? 
  and that is relevant to ` playing with two sets of cards ' here how ? 
  you believe prez niinist\u00f6 was really having clandestine trade negotiations with putin ? 
   after following the convoy for 2 days they were n't following that convoy for two days . 
  seems you 're confused . 
  the military convoy that crossed the border into ukraine only appeared yesterday evening . 
  there 's multiple eyewittness accounts , pictures and even video of it while there was still light . 
   a short flash wo n't be noticed wut ? 
  have ever actually used an adequate flash in darkness to make such nonsensical claim ? 
   and they would n't shoot the reporter you know this how ? 
  there 's a military operation in a warzone . 
  suddenly you see a bright flash going off nearby . 
  where do you think your gun would probably be pointing next ? 
  and even if there 's no shooting there 's the obvious risk of getting detained and losing your chance to report what you just wittnessed . 
   why are n't there any pictures ? 
  i just told you .
