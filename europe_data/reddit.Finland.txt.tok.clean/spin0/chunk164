  to what end would opec reduce their output ? 
  with their < 40 % market share opec would only lose even more . 
  if they did cut their production the prices would go up but that would be only temporary as other producers would up their production causing the prices to fall again . 
  and then opec would be back to square one but with even smaller market share . 
  the only way opec would cut their production would be if other producers outside opec would cut theirs too . 
  and that is a long shot which likely wo n't happen . 
  why ? 
  because the us wildcatters wo n't collectively agree to any production cuts - that would be like herding cats . 
  and because the last time opec tried that with russia ( 2008-9 ) they got promises of cuts to russian production but russia betrayed its promises grabbing some market share instead . 
   and if the usa increase their interest rates again , this will also affect the oil price . 
  it would make the oil prices go down , just as the previous rate hike did , as it makes the usd stonger . 
  the question is how big an effect would it have . 
  see for example : [ oil seen heading to $ 20 by morgan stanley on dollar strength ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-11/morgan-stanley-sees-20-a-barrel-oil-on-u-s-dollar-appreciation ) * a rapid appreciation of the u.s. dollar may send brent oil to as low as $ 20 a barrel , according to morgan stanley . 
  oil is particularly leveraged to the dollar and may fall between 10 to 25 percent if the currency gains 5 percent , morgan stanley analysts including adam longson said in a research note dated jan. 
   the new outlook , obtained by the vedomosti business newspaper , assumed an average oil price of $ 40 per barrel over 2016 , down from the $ 50 per barrel built into the current budget plan , still an optimistic assumption . 
  i do n't know why the russian gov constantly overestimates the oil prices , it does not help anything and only makes assessing the situation more difficult . 
  meanwhile quatar has planned their 2016 budget assuming $ 30 average oil price , and saudi arabia assuming $ 29 . smth . 
  no i do n't and i do n't care . 
  edit : aww , you ninjaedited your comment . 
  how adorably cunning . 
   who gives a damn about quelques arpents de neige ? 
  i do n't know what that is , and i do n't care what you personally give a damn about . 
  i merely pointed out your obvious lack of knowlegde regarding things you were trying to criticize - iow you know nothing what you 're talking about . 
   we send troops into scandinavia to practice their skiing . 
  what a waste . 
  it 's important training if one is to survive and maintain their ability to conduct military operations in arctic or sub-arctic conditions . 
  what you just said only demonstrates how little you know what it takes - it 's much more than learning how to ski . 
  for the five u.s. marines the course was new , and for the three u.s. army alaska soldiers it provided an opportunity to compare and share knowledge and methods . 
  you can read more on the us army website : [ usrak soldiers attend finnish army 's cold weather training ] ( http://www.army.mil/article/141917/usrak_soldiers_attend_finnish_army_s_cold_weather_training/ )  the key learning elements of cwobcs include squad movement and fighting techniques in sub-arctic conditions , safe and effective weapons handling in sub-zero conditions , ski technique with military skis , using snow vehicles , making and using snow shelters for fighting and accommodation , orienteering in snow-covered terrain , basic winter survival skills , and sustaining health and performance in cold-weather operations , and understanding the importance of nutrition and hydration in winter conditions . 
  this page has a video of a soldier performing the falling-into-fozen-lake-on-skis training : http://yle.fi/uutiset/sissi_nayttaa_nain_noustaan_hyisesta_avannosta_taysvarustuksessa__video/8599793 during the course the temperatures hit -39 c ( -38.2 f ) . 
  [ image ] ( https://i.imgur.com/m8ubpjo.jpg ) this thread over at militaryporn has an album with much more images : https://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/40oape/us_soldiers_and_marines_participating_in_the/ relevant article on the us army website : http://www.army.mil/article/141917/usrak_soldiers_attend_finnish_army_s_cold_weather_training/  in the final part of the course , the students had to jump into freezing water , remove their skis , come out of the water and build a fire . 
  after sustaining their fire they were able to change ending the 10-day course with and after action review . 
  i never said that . 
  i said most of fx reserves are illiquid ** or ** in already earmarked funds . 
  two things has been said . 
  between them is the conjunction or . 
  learn reading . 
  indeed , that is correct . 
  so , please stop lying about what i wrote . 
   you said the fx reserves are illiquid and can not be used freely . 
  no , i did not . 
  please stop lying , and read more carefully what i actually wrote . 
  never said that . 
  i said :  most of that fx reserve is illiquid or in already earmarked funds, 
   source ? 
  you can easily find sources discussing the structure of russia 's fx reserve which includes the russian national wealth fund , and the reserve fund discussed in op . 
  for example : http://imrussia.org/en/analysis/economy/2362-russias-currency-reserves-more-than-enough-or-alarmingly-low  russia 's not-so-hidden problem lies elsewhere -- in the structure of its forex reserves . 
  the central bank is open about what funds are included in the reserves , but they do n't exactly advertise one key fact : the total includes most of russia 's two sovereign wealth funds , known as the reserve fund and the national wealth fund . 
  these funds were formed in 2008 out of the stabilization fund , which was created in 2004 to collect surplus revenues from energy exports . 
  each of these two caches has the equivalent of about $ 75 billion in it right now , or roughly 6 percent of gdp , and the government has started liberally dipping into this money . 
  it is using the reserve fund to cover an estimated budget deficit of 3.7 percent of gdp this year ( 2.68 trillion rubles ) , while more than 500 billion rubles from the national wealth fund has been earmarked for investment projects and to help struggling state-owned companies . 
  then we can rule the world together . 
  here 's a relevant research paper by the institute of criminology and legal policy in finland : http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf compared to native finns the crime rate of rape is 13 times higher by men immigrated from middle-east or north-africa . 
  and that is after accounting for sociodemografic factors such as age , income , and housing . 
  sociodemografic factors do not explain the fact that immigrants from those regions are far more likely to commit rape in finland than native finns or immigrants from other parts of the world . 
  in 2012 third of all rape convictics in finland were of foreign origin and in aggravated rape 41 % which is alarmingly high considering their very small percentage of population . 
  heh , that sounds fantastic !, 
  there could also be competition in true guinness world record style : * the longest distance achieved between tango partners * . 
  there 's no competition , you are the roots of tango and you hands down win in that competition . 
  instead of competing you should bring us more tango !, 
  as you 're an american i assume your mother tongue is english . 
  that means learning finnish is the hardest of those as it 's in a whole different language family very far from your own language . 
  finnish is not germanic and not even indo-european but from a whole different language family . 
  the u.s. defense language institute classifies finnish as a level iii language in terms of learning difficulty for native english speakers , and the state department 's foreign service institute as category iv . 
  in the internet you can find some memes about the quirks regarding the finnish language [ such as this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qfm6sce.png ) . 
  as to which country is the most beautiful , [ why finland of course !, 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/85/36/a4/8536a481d016a4a6f0db2aaa61958445.jpg ) nah , just kidding . 
  all nordic countries are beautiful in their own way . 
   culturally works too !, 
  no , it does n't . 
  culturally we 're all very reserved in all nordic countries . 
  for example see this post and comments : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40wmvw/finnish_people_in_a_nutshell/, 
  finnish is very different from the others being in a whole different langage family and all : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages swedish , norwegian , danish and icelandic are all germanic languages just as english is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_languages swedes , norwegians , and danes basically understand each other with effort , and until recently there even used to be a common pigding called skandinaviska which got used in meetings and such . 
  of those icelandic is a special case as no-one else understands it , and that marvellous language is a sort of an ice-box , an old norse language frozen in time . 
  basically , you 'll do well in english as pretty much everyone speaks it in the nordic countries . 
  if you want to impress locals with your phrases then pick one language . 
  and as you may have read , if you actually did read the op , the facts of the matter are quite different from what they have so far claimed in their effort of clearing * themselves * from doing anything wrong . 
  according to dn dn has done nothing wrong , news at eleven . 
  according to dn dn is the best thing evah , says the dn . 
  yet the reality certainly does not look like it . 
   top level comment about how sweden has the silver medal in rape statistics i have not written any such comment . 
  maybe you should take * your * comment into correct thread discussing that instead of complaining to me ? 
  basic rediquette people , not that hard . 
  since you 're from argentina , and deep down we have something very deep in common , i 'll let you on a little secret about us finns : we are a * tango nation !, 
  * yes , by looking at that picture you would not believe it but we are . 
  so there 's your chance to cross the personal space and to get close to a finn . 
  you already know how to do it . 
  you already have it . 
  every year hundreds of thousands of finns ( mind you there are only 5.5 million of us ) get together to the annual tango market , and a tango queen and tango king is chosen . 
  here 's the 2014 tango king testing the future queen : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx0cyu9tnxe strange , huh ? 
  people as reserved as finns actually love tango to the bone . 
  more in this german documentary : [ midsummer night 's tango ] ( http://www.gebrueder-beetz.de/en/productions/midsummer-nights-tang ) ( aka . 
  cheek to cheek ) * tango was born in buenos aires and no one dances tango as passionately as the argentineans do - that is at least what the argentineans themselves believe . 
  tango is as finnish as sauna and skiing - that is what the famous finnish director aki kaurism\u00e4ki and many of his fellow countrymen are convinced of . 
  two countries , two opinions , two musical traditions . 
  midsummer night 's tango is a humorous , light-hearted road movie , accompanying three argentinean tango musicians as they leave the milongas of buenos aires behind to discover tango in faraway finland . 
  * the trailer gives you an idea : [ midsummer night 's tango - trailer ] ( http://www.gemafilms.com/ingles/peliculas_trailer.php?vid=17&amp;titulo=midsummer%20night%20tango ) there you have it . 
  now you know how to breach our personal space as you like and rule us finns . 
  but make no mistake , we may be a tango nation but we 're a metal nation too - as this map of metal bands per 100,000 inhibitants demonstrates : http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/560-a-world-map-of-heavy-metal-density, 
  [ well , you 'll have to visit us and see how it might work over here .
