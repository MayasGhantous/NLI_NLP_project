  for example we do n't know how many of those far over a million people that entered the eu last year are actually refugees from fighting areas . 
  yet we are discussing relocating them , and the eu is trying to impose mandatory quotas . 
  from ukraine poland has been accepting not only actual refugees from fighting areas but large numbers of other people * too * . 
  that is * in addition to * actual refugees fleeing the fighting . 
  now , how many ukrainians have other eu countries accepted ? 
  is it more or less than what poland has already done ? 
  i 'd say poland has done a lot more than most other eu countries . 
  could you link a translation ? 
  yes , only ukrainians fleeing from the fighting areas are considered refugees just as it should be . 
  but poland has been very open with ukrainians using also other migration statuses , and hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have gone to poland . 
  and i would say poland has done quite a lot regarding ukraine and ukrainians leaving their country , much more than most other eu countries . 
  already eight months ago the estimates were about 300,000-400 ,000 ukrainians in poland . 
  and that was eight months ago .

  great video . 
  smart use of a tree @ 7:00 -  there was also an international training course in finland . 
  u.s. marines and u.s. army alaska soldiers were attending the 10-day finnish army 's cold weather operations basic course in lapland . 
  the training included squad movement and fighting techniques in sub-arctic conditions , safe and effective weapons handling in sub-zero conditions , ski technique with military skis , using snow vehicles , making and using snow shelters for fighting and accommodation , orienteering in snow-covered terrain , basic winter survival skills , and sustaining health and performance in cold-weather operations , and understanding the importance of nutrition and hydration in winter conditions . 
  they got a realistic experience of the winter conditions as the temperatures hit -39 c ( -38.2 f ) . 
  [ image ] ( https://i.imgur.com/m8ubpjo.jpg ) this thread over at militaryporn has an album with much more images : https://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/40oape/us_soldiers_and_marines_participating_in_the/ relevant article on the us army website : http://www.army.mil/article/141917/usrak_soldiers_attend_finnish_army_s_cold_weather_training/  in the final part of the course , the students had to jump into freezing water , remove their skis , come out of the water and build a fire . 
  after sustaining their fire they were able to change ending the 10-day course with and after action review . 
   he also praised russia 's macro-economic decisions , such as keeping interest rates low . 
  11 % is not `` low '' . 
  perhaps a typo ? 
  in addition to the print media there were also television adverts in the soviet union , and their history is pretty unique . 
  those were all made by a single estonian enterprise eesti reklaamfilm which was established in 1967 by peedu ojamaa . 
  the first television adverts in the soviet union were made that same year . 
  the peculiar thing in the soviet system was that the producers of consumer goods had to use certain amount of their budget for advertising - it was mandatory . 
  because making a television advert was an easy way to spend that money and eesti reklaamfilm was the only one making them , in its heyday it produced hundreds of advert films a year . 
  the enterprise became wealthy and its founder peedu ojamaa a well-off self-made-man . 
  during the 24 years of its existence eesti reklaamfilm made over 5000 adverts . 
  the mandatory advertising spending sometimes led to absurd situations . 
  sometimes adverts were filmed in exotic far-away places just to make sure all the money got spent . 
  or sometimes the goods were not available to consumers even when there were adverts . 
  and sometimes the goods advertised were quite peculiar such as a double-layered outhouse toilet cover . 
  the important thing was the advertising money got spent and creating consumer demand for a product was not always the primary goal . 
  this also led to unusual styles in adverts . 
  one of the advert producers notable for his unique style was estonian harry egipt , here 's his 1986 advert for minced chicken meat ( * kanaa * = chicken ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6lavk1shw8 this dark humour filled energy-saving campaign advert by priit p\u00e4rn won the bronze lion in cannes 1988 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkcuh8k4l8s here 's an interesting documentary telling the remarkable story of eesti reklaamfilm and its founder and director peedu ojamaa : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3216380/ trailer : [ goldspinners trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv6imosbp2o ), 
  and not just any seal but one of the rarest freshwater seals in the world which only lives in lake saimaa : [ saimaa ringed seal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saimaa_ringed_seal )  the saimaa ringed seal ( pusa hispida saimensis ) is a subspecies of ringed seal ( pusa hispida ) . 
  they are among the most endangered seals in the world , having a total population of only about 310 individuals . 
  the only existing population of these seals is found in lake saimaa , finland ( hence the name ) . 
  the population is descended from ringed seals that were separated from the rest when the land rose after the last ice age . 
  there 's a very good nature documentary about the seals : * j\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4 rakastavat * ( the ice-loving seals , 2011 ) . 
  nature photographer [ juha taskinen ] ( http://koti.suursaimaa.com/juhata/eng/home.html ) has filmed their life , challenges and conservation efforts for over 15 years , and has been able to capture unique moments of the seal 's life under water and ice . 
  it might be available in some streaming services in english , but here 's the full documentary in french : [ documentaire les phoques du lac saimaa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de4inmkjlps ) . 
  the film has some quite amazing and unique imagery , and it 's well worth watching even if you 're not into french . 
  more of an indie production yet quite good documentary , and readily available in english : [ seal of saimaa - english ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuwospkgjs8 ) it 's a story about two brothers who grew up on the lakeside but have never seen the saimaa ringed seal . 
  they take a canoe trip across the landscapes of lake saimaa in search of the rare animal . 
   just trying to get you to think about how you arrived at that conclusion . 
  thank you but i have already thought about that . 
  my conclusion is that in almost any poll you can find small percentage agreeing to idiotic things . 
  just for one example , [ in this poll ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/16/islamic-state-arab-nations-britain-support_n_5995548.html ) 7 % in uk view isis favourably . 
  how do i know what ? 
  that in any poll you 'll find small percentage agreeing to most idiotic things ? 
  by reading polls . 
   incredibly unjust . 
  but is n't it the same rule that applies to danish citizens themselves ? 
  how is it unjust . 
   a serious question about isis even when the question is `` serious '' you 'll find the small percentage . 
  that 's what happens in any poll . 
   russian president vladimir putin said in an interview with german newspaper bild that russia 's economy is , at best , fifth in the world in terms of volume . 
  what an unrealistically optimistic statement . 
  russia is not even in the top ten . 
   the kremlin expects gdp growth of around 0.7 percent for 2016 . 
  great expectations i see . 
  good luck with that . 
   what 's your basis for this opinion ? 
  i think you just answered your own question . 
  for example , as your own link shows 4 % in that poll agreed lizard people control politics , and 13 % believe obama is the antichrist . 
  you can easily find polls with a small percentage agreeing to most ridiculous ideas . 
   and 10 % is not very few . 
  it 's 7.5 million . 
  and 12 million americans believe lizard people run their country . 
  that 's even more !, 
  not to mention the over 40 million believing obama is the antichrist . 
  so , in other words very few . 
  you can easily get that small support for pretty much any ridiculous idea in polls . 
  you 'll always have 5-10 % that believes the world is ruled by lizards or smth . 
  even more curious is the fact that the festival we are the sthlm promotes itself as europe 's biggest festival for everyone between the ages 13 -- 19 - making it the largest collection of underage potential victims for sexual harrassment or assault . 
  it simply baffles me that there was no reporting on the joint sexual harrassment by gangs taking place in there . 
  if i was a parent i would consider that an important thing to know before letting my child go to that event . 
  the failures in reporting are not only baffling , it 's appalling . 
   the original source is die welt ( in german ) : das ph\u00e4nomen `` taharrush gamea '' ist in deutschland angekommen, 
  rt is generally considered russian gov propaganda outlet . 
   iltasanomat ( a dailymail - like tabloid ) it is not a dailymail-like tabloid . 
  ilta-sanomat does not publish fake news , it is politically neutral , and it is a reliable news source just as any in finland . 
  it is published by the same company that publishes the biggest daily newspaper helsingin sanomat . 
  despite being taboid-sized it is not like the tabloids in the uk such as daily mail or daily mirror . 
  til that this phenomenon of jointly committed sexual harassment of girls and women has a name : [ ` taharrush gamea ' comes to germany ? 
  police fear cologne sex abuse may be imported practice ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/328561-taharrush-germany-assault-collective/ )  the federal criminal police office ( bka ) , the main investigative authority in germany , said in a response to welt newspaper it knows sexual harassment of women in public is widespread in arab countries , and that this is exactly what happened on new year 's eve in cologne . 
  collective harassment is translated as `` taharrush gamea '' ( \u062d\u0631\u0634 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a ) . 
    `` such crimes are committed by groups of young men ... mostly when there are large gatherings of people , such as demonstrations . 
  they range from sexual harassment to rape , '' the bka told welt . 
  ( sorry for the rt link , but that was the first english language article i found where this phenomenon is called by its name ) edit : the original source is die welt ( in german ) : [ das ph\u00e4nomen `` taharrush gamea '' ist in deutschland angekommen ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150813517/das-phaenomen-taharrush-gamea-ist-in-deutschland-angekommen.html ), 
   to be fair , is is a pretty shitty paper . 
  that 's not a fair asessment at all . 
  is is a credible news source in finland . 
  and the news is also reported by many other sources such as yle : http://yle.fi/uutiset/helsingin_poliisi_seksuaalisesta_hairinnasta_syksyn_mittaan_hairioita_ilmioksi_asti/8583599,
