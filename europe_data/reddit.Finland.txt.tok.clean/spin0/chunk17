  there are pictures of the convoy heading to the border when there was still light . 
  it was already dark when it reached the border . 
  and even in finland by far most businesses support eu 's sanctions : [ poll : most businesses support sanctions against russia ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/poll_most_businesses_support_sanctions_against_russia/7411040 )  the majority of business leaders in finland say they staunchly support economic sanctions against russia , according to a poll by the finnish chamber of commerce . 
  the survey showed that two-thirds of respondents either supported the current sanctions or would like to see tighter restrictions against russia . 
  thanks putin . 
  also looking forward to the cheap norwegian salmon season . 
  as testified by aeroflot . 
  https://twitter.com/martinkaco/status/497841253707702272  en route by aeroflot to vie , captain to passengers : `` we fly over remnants of ukraine , where banderovtsi and other filth lives '' . 
  unbelievable, 
   trying to play with two sets of cards . 
  how so ? 
   why are there no pictures of that happening ? 
  there are images and even a video of the convoy heading towards the border taken earlier in the evening when there was still some light . 
  we also have number of separate witnesses of the convoy heading towards the border at various points , who also noted that the convoy did not come back nor could it be found at border crossings . 
  this establishes : the convoy existed , it went towards the border , and then it either vanished or continued across the border ( which was also witnessed ) . 
  the border crossing witnessed by the telegraph happened in the night when it was dark . 
  had roland oliphant taken pictures it is likely you would not see much in them , probably merely some bright headlights of the vehicles . 
  he would have needed a flash or some other type of lightning . 
  using that would have revealed that he was photographing . 
  that might have been risky for him and his reporting . 
  the convoy was also observed by a russian journalist : http://20committee.com/2014/08/14/is-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-underway/ and http://www.newtimes.ru/articles/detail/85685 additionally there 's ( unconfirmed ) observation of a different convoy with nine russian tanks , military vehicles and at least one of the white trucks in ukraine on h21 highway heading towards donetsk .

  also reported by yahoo and reuters : [ russian oil giant seeks funds earmarked for pensions ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/russian-oil-giant-seeks-funds-earmarked-pensions-130438063--sector.html )  russia 's rosneft , which produces more oil than iraq or iran , is seeking a $ 42 billion loan from a fund earmarked for russian pensions to help it weather western sanctions imposed over moscow 's role in ukraine . 
  they probably just did what they have been doing for weeks already . 
  but this was the first time western journalists happened to be there to witness it . 
  also ( unconfirmed ) observation of a convoy of nine russian tanks , military vehicles and one of the white trucks in ukraine on h21 highway heading towards donetsk .

  also new trucks have joined the southern part of the convoy - military trucks painted white .

  edit : the convoy has stopped right before the ukrainian border . 
  https://twitter.com/bbcstever/status/499868150973075456  we have turned off the m4 highway , the turning to the russian town of donetsk near the border ; lorries are parking in a field ( please note , donetsk in russia - not the other donetsk in se ukraine ) also : https://twitter.com/tombartonjourno/status/499878470072434689  trucks have turned towards the border but now parking up .

  1 said only short break but not sure looks like their plan is to proceed towards luhansk on the m4 highway . 
  ** edit2 : ** the international committee of the red cross reports they have made a contact with the convoy : https://twitter.com/icrc/status/499934532943220738  clarification : we 've made initial contact with #russia - led aid convoy , rostov region , #russia . 
  many practical details to be clarified .

  too buzy to provide a proper translation , perhaps someone else will . ), 
  is it true girls in malta are particularly promiscuous ? 
  so , you actually believe what you said without a shred of actual evidence such as opinion polls to support it . 
  that 's a treacherous path to thread , my friend . 
   asking for sources for some pieces of news while automatically accepting others as hard truth ... you can see this happen all the time , including here . 
  putin says : i 'm not going to annex crimea . 
  * annexes crimea * putin says : no russian troops in crimea . 
  * later admits they were , also gives medals * why do you think it so happens that ` some pieces of news ' are taken with bigger grain of salt than others ? 
  is it because ` western propaganda ' - or might it be because we have a proven liar as a ceo of russia inc controlling its media as a propaganda machine ? 
  because i think the negative attitudes towards vladimir putin are actually the result of his * actions * and not the result of mere ` biased western media ' . 
  ` people around * you * ' = = ` people in the west ' ? 
  do n't you think you 're using a bit too wide brush there ? 
  let 's reformulate you original claim with this new bit of information from you :  i just think that people ~ ~ in the west ~ ~ around me really believe that russia is on the verge of nuking everybody and putin is literally hitler . 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
   i just think that people in the west really believe that russia is on the verge of nuking everybody and putin is literally hitler . 
  * why * do you believe that ? 
  do you have opinion polls to support your personal notion of what ` people in the west ' actually think ? 
   if you think western media is unbiased all media certainly has its biases . 
  heck , it even starts with the medium itself ( * `` the medium is the message '' * ) . 
  but there are fundamental differences between `` western '' media and state controlled propaganda in russia . 
  because the media field in the west is generally heterogenic people can read/hear/watch different media with different biases , different opinions and different points of view . 
  not so when media is a state controlled propaganda machine . 
  as the soviet kgb head lavrenti beria said : `` show me the man and i will find the crime . '', 
   i do n't know if i can see russia do that to a german company . 
  there are some cases where they have done that too - most famous case being how russia blackmailed lufthansa cargo to relocate its central asia cargo hub from kazakhstan to siberia : [ lufthansa cargo chief rejects pressure to fly to siberia ] ( http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-11-04/news/27689993_1_russian-airport-asian-hub-lufthansa-cargo ), 
  yes , the finnish government has banned importing eu stuff to russia . 
  they 're powerful like that . 
   butter mountain what is this , '70s ? 
  nah , image source is reuters and iirc according to the original caption he 's buying it for a restaurant ( which seems plausible ) . 
  meanwhile the russian intefax has gone by a technically almost correct but a bit more vivid caption : * this buyer does not know that the finnish valio has denied care to the russian market and buys cheese oltermanni reserve . 
  * ( [ google translated ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.interfax.ru%2fbusiness%2f390364 ) ) see , it 's all valio 's fault . 
  also : [ president of ukraine had a phone conversation with president of the international committee of the red cross ] ( http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/30965.html ), 
  okay , let 's go through it in simple enough terms . 
  ** how do i nuclear deterrent ? 
  establish doctrine on how you plan to use it . 
  say so . 
  because otherwise it would n't be much of a deterrent . 
  we have : 1 . 
  russia establishing their military doctrine regarding nukes . 
  russia saying so . 
  ergo , russia 's nuclear doctrine is what they claim it to be . 
  no your use of scare quotes nor attemps at false equivalences will change that fact . 
  russia 's nuclear doctrine is what it is , and what they have stated it to be . 
  it is also irrelevant who has used nukes 70 years ago - what matters is what russia 's * current * doctrine is . 
  so do you honestly think russian state controlled media upholds and represents freedom of speech ? 
   if you really believe that channels which do not `` air a wide variety of opinions and viewpoints '' should be banned , no , i do not believe so . 
  but i do have a beef with state controlled propaganda , and in this case in particular state controlled channels filled with state controlled propaganda while censoring other viewpoints . 
  this guy seems to love valio oltermanni 17 % cheese though : http://www.interfax.ru/ftproot/photos/photostory/2014/08/08/600me10.jpg, 
   please be because censorship is wrong ... 
  if you honestly believe that censorship is wrong , then how do you assess the channels in question ? 
  do they upholp the principles of freedom of speech ? 
  do they air a wide variety of opinions and viewpoints ?
