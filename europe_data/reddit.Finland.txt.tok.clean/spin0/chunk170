  what i find interesting is how long it took to report about it in finland . 
  i had seen some observations in the social media by people present but the police and the media reported about it only today . 
  and that reporting has been quite conflicting and confusing with the minister of interior saying one thing , the helsinki police chief another and then the detective chief inspector of the national board of investigation yet another . 
  here 's what the im said : [ interior minister says he 's satisfied with police action on new year 's eve ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/interior_minister_says_hes_satisfied_with_police_action_on_new_years_eve/8578199 ) * pre-emptive action by the police on new year 's eve may have been the reason the celebrations passed off without any major incidents , says interior minister petteri orpo . 
  orpo said that police action had been based on intelligence that crimes were being planned . 
  * here 's what the police chief said ( he says there was a threat of similar events taking place as happened in cologne , but unfortunately in finnish ) : http://yle.fi/uutiset/helsingin_poliisi_kolnin_hairinta_uhkasi_tapahtua_myos_helsingissa__1_000_turvapaikanhakijaa_asematunnelissa/8576615 and he also discusses it in this afp article with quotes in english : http://www.afp.com/en/news/unprecedented-sex-harassment-helsinki-new-year-police and then here 's what the nbi detective chief inspector said : [ nbi : no german link in helsinki train station incident ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/nbi_no_german_link_in_helsinki_train_station_incident/8577608 ), 
  no , three cases is not the unprecented thing here . 
  unprecented was the fact that 1000 young iraqi males , who had travelled there from asylym centers in various cities in finland , gathered to the helsinki cenral railway station . 
  i think it 's highly unlikely they all simply randomly happened to be there , and my common sense says it was likely an organized thing . 
  that fact by itself does not mean they all got there to harrass people and they may have travelled there just to celebrate together in a gentlemany manner . 
  in any case the police had been tipped beforehand about possible plans of sexual harassment and thefts , and the police said they were well prepared , were visible , dispersed some groups and detained several persons . 
  and so far they have received just three reports of sexual harassment/assault .

  yeah , i probably would have . 
  and frankly i 'm not a big fan of that pakko part - just said it as pakkoruotsi as that was what we had . 
  uhm ... that was not very helpful . 
   it 's not meant for crowds . 
  according to senseiswag to whom i was responding to :  the mayor explicitly said it was a general guideline to proactively protect against theft at large events , specifically the kareval celebrations . 
  if karneval celebrations is not crowds then i do n't know what is . 
  she said : `` there 's ** always ** the possibility of keeping a certain distance of more than an arm 's length -- that is to say to make sure yourself you do n't look to be too close to people who are not known to you , and to whom you do n't have a trusting relationship , '' that is either nonsense as it 's impossible , or it has the implicit meaning of staying out of crowds as that 's the * only * way to attain such . 
  but ... but i loved the pakkoruotsi at school . 
  to my knowledge , yes . 
   why are you getting your panties in a twist so much ? 
  could you stop with this line already ? 
  that 's exactly what i said after reading her nonsense `` precautions '' . 
  there 's simply no way anyone can follow those in a karnival . 
  and if it is true she will say something else about it in the future as you implied i hope it 's something smart and not useless . 
  i 'm not upset but i can easily see why some people are . 
   it 's unrealistic , but it 's not nonsense . 
  an unrealistic `` precaution '' is nonsense in my books . 
   people are n't packed like sardines even at large events . 
  yet when i look at pictures from karnival in cologne i fail to grasp how one is supposed to keep people at `` more than an arm 's length '' in that crowd . 
  it 's simply impossible . 
  unless one stays out of it and does not go to see the floaters and stands somewhere more distant from the crowds . 
  is that the `` precaution '' women should follow ? 
  stay out ? 
   that 's why it 's a precaution . 
  but it 's nonsense even as `` a precaution '' . 
  you simply ca n't keep people at `` more than an arm 's length '' . 
  how do you do that in a crowd ? 
  the irony . 
  jumping in and making false claims in a thread conserning false claims while falsely claiming manufacture of false claims . 
  falception . 
   the mayor explicitly said it was a general guideline to proactively protect against theft at large events , specifically the kareval celebrations . 
  did she actually say this ? 
   `` there 's always the possibility of keeping a certain distance of more than an arm 's length -- that is to say to make sure yourself you do n't look to be too close to people who are not known to you , and to whom you do n't have a trusting relationship , '' she said . 
  `` women would also be smart not to go and embrace everyone that you meet and who seems to be nice . 
  such offers could be misunderstood , and that is something every woman and every girl should protect herself from , '' because if she actually said that it 's stupid , and no wonder if some people are outraged . 
  obviously there 's not always the possibility to keep people around you at more than an arm 's length , nor there should be need for that . 
  go to a crowded bus , train , tram , metro - good luck at keeping everyone at `` more than an arm 's length '' . 
  go to a celebrating crowd - good luck at keeping everyone at `` more than an arm 's length '' . 
  when someone approaches you in that crowd - good luck at keeping everyone at `` more than an arm 's length '' . 
  when multiple assailants approach you from around you in that crowd - good luck at keeping everyone at `` more than an arm 's length '' . 
  there is certainly not `` always the possibility of keeping a certain distance of more than an arm 's length '' . 
  and especially not when it would matter most . 
  well , all i can add is that i disagree with you about mere ignorance being the relevant factor behind the events , and i find it highly unlikely they were unaware that what they were doing was illegal in germany . 
  suddenly there was 1000 young iraqi guys at helsinki central railway station who had travelled there from asylym centers in various cities in finland . 
  i think it 's highly unlikely they all simply randomly happened to be there , and my common sense says it was likely an organized thing . 
  that by itself does not mean they all got there to harrass people and they may have travelled there just to celebrate together in a gentlemany manner . 
  in any case the police had been tipped beforehand and they said they were well prepared , were visible , dispersed some crowds and detained some . 
  and so far they have received just three reports of sexual harassment . 
  what i find interesting is how long it took to report about it in finland . 
  i had seen some observations in the social media by people present but the police and the media reported about it only today . 
   have no comprehension of german societal norms and/or laws . 
  so you assume that they believe theft and robbery is a-ok and perfectly legal thing to do in germany . 
  i have to say i find that highly unlikely . 
   not so much organised i do n't know about that .

  and i wonder what will happen with person 2,000,001 . 
  probably german calls for solidarity and new forced relocation quotas for everyone - or else . . 
  what `` livable free space '' ? 
  i just told you that people do not live in free space . 
  they live in housing , and the current estimates are that building the housing will cost billions . 
   it 's not only about capita , it 's also about space people do not live in space , they live in housing in cities and towns . 
  population density per sqkm is nonsensical measure in the context as people wo n't live in the vast areas of forests , lakes and boglands in finland . 
   the transformation of `` arab '' society in the past 20 30 years . 
  there 's currently a good thread about that over at askhistorians : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3zppoc/what_led_to_the_popularity_of_political_islam_and/, 
   finland is already connected through russia . 
  only in geographical sense , not in any practical logistical sense as you 'd obviously have to go through the political entity called russian federation which is costly , slow , and totally dependend on russia 's erratic policies which have varied day by day for decades already . 
  finland 's main export market is the eu and in logistical sense finland is an island regarding the eu and mainland europe . 
  i drink from all of those alcohol groups just as required by a healthy , balanced diet . 
  and yet you 're the first one to mention muslims here . 
  in that sense i think a better comparison would be the great belt bridge . 
  the channel tunnel does not really connect two metropolitan areas in the same way as london and paris are quite distant even with the channel tunnel . 
  noooo we need to build our boozetube2000 !, 
   forgotten refugee camp if these people are actual refugees then why instead of applying for asylym in france they choose live in an illegal camp ? 
   teach them the rules here and make them accept them . 
  what makes you to assume these people do not know the relevant laws and rules ?
