  you seem to assume only mere ignorance of those is the cause here . 
  i do n't believe for a second that no-one in germany has ever told them that sexually assaulting women is not allowed . 
  and on the second part : how the hell are you going to * make * someone accept the rules and laws when they apparently do n't want to but rather adhere to their own ? 
  by using force ? 
  or what ? 
  i have no idea what groups you 're talking about . 
  does it include the heavy metal group ? 
   which cultural group do they belong to ? 
  wtf is that supposed to mean ? 
  afaik finland belongs to the heavy metal group . 
  and to the tango group . 
  i very much support the idea . 
  not only would the tunnel connect us with our southern bros but also at long last would finland stop being an island regarding the eu and mainland europe . 
  but it 's all for a good cause : [ finnish booze rally helps fund estonian literature ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_booze_rally_helps_fund_estonian_literature/6784639 ), 
  the big difference with the channel tunnel is the geology . 
  due to geology a tunnel between tallinn and helsinki is much cheaper to build . 
   there 's no proof that the perpetrators were refugees . 
  google translation :  from the environment of the north rhine-westphalian ministry of the interior on the other hand it is , some of the perpetrators had come about two years ago from north africa to germany ** as refugees ** , their integration is so far apparently not successful . 
  this let arise a fear within the north rhine-westphalian law enforcement agencies that could spread or amplify fears of refugees in the population . 
   pre-europe age what 's that ? 
  the oligocene epoch ? 
  this is very good news . 
   i doubt that is true . 
  [ cider consumption soars in poland : despite a russian trade embargo on its apples , poland 's fruit suppliers and cider-makers are brimming with confidence as the drink has rapidly grown in popularity across the country . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ckc9m/cider_consumption_soars_in_poland_despite_a/ ), 
  yes , depending on time frame some slavic peoples were victims , some perpetrators and some both . 
  in the slave trade networks the raiders , transporters , traders and end-clients were often different and who they were changed over time . 
  depending on the time period there were for example varangians , tatars , muscovites and russians making raids to finland and karelia capturing people into slavery , and transporting them to be sold for example on the slave markets of the crimean khanate , from where they ended up to the ottoman empire and middle east and to the other khanates in the east . 
  as late as during the great northern war ( 1700 -- 1721 ) russia invaded and occupied finland , and russians unleashed a reign of terror known as the great wrath ( 1713 -- 1721 ) during which tens of thousands finns were murdered or taken away as slaves . 
   we ca n't talk about the millions of europeans who were enslaved by muslim countries . 
  incidentally , in that slave trade the most high-priced slaves were young blond girls captured from finland and karelia . 
  here 's a well-researched and well-sourced article about that : [ blonde cargoes : finnish children in the slave markets of medieval crimea ] ( http://mikedashhistory.com/2015/01/15/blonde-cargoes-finnish-children-in-the-slave-markets-of-medieval-crimea/ ) yet only few know about all that and there are some who want to believe that also finns have to carry the white man 's guilt including over institutionalized slavery when in fact finns actually were victims of it . 
   when a certain culture is hostile to facts , what does that say about it ? 
  a very relevant article : [ why some of the worst attacks on social science have come from liberals ] ( http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/when-liberals-attack-social-science.html?mid=fb-share-scienceofus ) and it 's not only hostility to facts but also hostility to science itself freely exploring ideas and researching facts , and even going as far as forming slanderous personal witch hunts of scientists . 
  just for one example , the way biochemist and nobel laureate timothy hunt was forced to resign from his positions after the lies about him making * a joke * in his toast speech . 
  lies which were published by the leftist paper guardian contributing to the misguided witch hunt and to the on-line feminist hate mob 's two minutes of hate : [ the timothy hunt witch hunt ] ( https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-timothy-hunt-witch-hunt/ ), 
  yup . 
  we do n't have proper mountains in finland but [ fells . 
  ] ( http://www.nic.fi/~yllrasti/tunturi2004.jpg ) that 's because of their age . 
  they formed about 1.8-1 .9 bn years ago , used to be high mountains , but over ages they have gone through many ice ages and stuff eroding them to fells . 
  the mountain range [ scandes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_mountains ) in norway and sweden formed about 400-425 mn years ago , so those mountains have n't experienced as much erosion . 
  only a small part in [ finland 's arm extends to the scandes .

  pick your poison with the help of the blog above , he has tried almost everything . 
  also , why not celebrate the new year 's eve nordic style : http://www.salmiyuck.com/2010/10/ruining-perfectly-good-bottle-of-vodka.html, 
   how do you even eat salmiaki ? 
  you bravely put it in your mouth , do n't immediately succumb to the pain , and then write hilarious blogposts about your experiences : http://www.salmiyuck.com/search/label/caustic  the tulien salmiakki started off like a normal hard candy : mostly flavorless with a touch of sweet . 
  that 's also a troubling sign for salmiac . 
   with a minute , i was overcome with a unique sensation , almost like that of an impending sneeze . 
  as i continued `` enjoying '' this candy , a numbness started spreading throughout my mouth . 
  that was followed by a slight tingling sensation . 
  this is not the experience i 'd expect from candy ... which is yet another troubling sign . 
   things went downhill quickly . 
  my entire tongue went numb ( yet , somehow started hurting ) , and the tingling sensation started spreading . 
  in the exact opposite manner that menthol clears the sinuses , the tulien led to a difficulty breathing . 
  the numbing pain spread to my gums , teeth , and , well , just about everywhere else . 
   and then i bit down . 
  whatever unholy substance was amalgamated into this candy 's outershell was in its purist form in the center . 
  pain does n't even begin to describe what that sensation was like . 
  or gay-islamist-fascists, 
  well , just saying what it is . 
  in the us they have the second amendmend where owning and bearing firearms is defined as a right . 
  i do n't know of any eu country that has similar constitution . 
  instead owning firearms is regulated and licensed : you do n't have a right to own a firearm you need a permission first , which makes it a privilege not a right . 
   i support gun rights you american ? 
  we do n't have gun rights in europe , or at least i do n't know of an eu country that does . 
  generally over here owning a firearm is not a * right * but you need a licence and stuff . 
  heh , in helsinki the tap water has the final seal of approval of * trouts * rendering their service for over million people . 
  the water is taken from a large lake and flows by gravity through a 120 kilometer long tunnel in the bedrock ( [ the second longest tunnel in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4ij%c3%a4nne_water_tunnel ) ) . 
  it 's already drinkable when taken form the lake , but get 's sampled , treated , analyzed and monitored as per usual . 
  and then there 's the trout test . 
  trouts are good for the job because they 're cool , laidback sort of guys and yet they have very acute senses and are very sensitive . 
  as migrating fishes they react to tiniest changes in the water . 
  their breathing , heartbeat and behavior is monitored , and if there 's anything amiss , which other tests have n't caught , or if the water tastes even a tiny bit of funny to them they will alarm . 
  i may be drunk but i 'm already home . 
  as per your comments i have learned to know you as a redditor who is well versed in history including military history . 
  just wanted to ask you about something i 've been wondering for a long time : given that finns fought both the soviets and the germans in the wwii do you know if any military historians have looked into the finnish experience of how it was different ? 
  i mean , i have read quite a bunch of finnish unit histories and memoirs and stuff , all in finnish , and those who did experience fighting both the soviets and the germans do mention some differences . 
  but do you know if someone has actually studied that perspective and published on it ? 
  but having islamist terrorists running wild in fort boyard would make the tv-show much more exciting . 
  russia you 're drunk go home . 
   well , arent most school massacres in the eu done with semi-automatic weapons ? 
  the last one was with a sword . 
  let 's ban swords . 
   i do n't see any reason why they should be legal you do n't need to yell . 
  here 's just some examples of perfectly legitimate uses : * national defence . 
  training shooting skills in reserve is important . 
  * hunting . 
  not all hunting requires semi-autos but it is often better . 
  * sports . 
  many shooting sports use semi-autos . 
  * pest control . 
  a semi-auto beats manual hands down when shooting rats or other pests . 
  * hobby . 
  people do shooting as a hobby using semi-autos . 
   you have 1 fucking shot to kill that moose , if you miss , the moose will run away and you are screwed and with a fucking musket the moose is screwed too running around with its guts falling out and all . 
   but this is just my personal view of the subject yup . 
  i can tell you 're an expert . 
   the fact is that this law has been prepared for quite a while , so they used the latest terrorist attack to be able to pass it through with minimal opposition .
