  edit : this guy puts it well in simplest possible terms in this video on bloomberg : [ pkverleger llc president phil verleger discusses the changing economics of oil with betty liu on `` bloomberg markets . '' ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-12-11/iea-warns-of-worsening-oil-glut ) `` oil is the new corn . '', 
  as opec cartel lost its power to set prices the oil market has become a very competitive free market , like any other commodity , which keeps the prices low . 
  and if there is a swing producer on this new market it 's the numerous us frackers who can and will react swiftly to price changes . 
  for opec to get their cartel position back they would need to cut their production and at the same time others to cut their production even more . 
  for every barrel saudi arabia would cut others would need to cut three . 
  wo n't happen . 
  `` much of the oil will stay in the ground . '', 
  that concerns longer term . 
  it has become more and more obvious that with efforts to mitigate the global climate change much of the known oil will need to stay in the ground . 
  and on long term the old adage `` oil in the ground is worth more than money in the bank '' does not hold true any more . 
  to make money you 'll have to produce while you can even for smaller profits , which means more competition on the market . 
  `` there is no benchmark . '', 
  `` venezuela is the first to give up . '', 
  probably so , and if venezuela 's production falls the oil prices will spike up . 
  but that 's only short term because the us frackers will swiftly rise their production for better prices causing the prices to fall again , and we 're back to square one . 
  `` opec is irrelevant . '', 
  that 's a dramatic way to put it , but does ring true . 
  opec has lost their power - at least for the time being - and some very dramatic changes need to happen if they were to get their position back . 
   turkey thinks that everyone is shit , but the kurds are the shittest of all not really the kurds but for example pkk and its affiliates . 
  turkey does train and support kurdish kdp-aligned peshmerga forces which are fighting against isis . 
  or perhaps it 's a reference to russia 's only aircraft carrier the admiral kuznetsov with its notorious breakdowns . 
  it 's so unreliable that tugboats need to go with it to tow it home when it loses power at sea : [ russian aircraft carrier towed home after break down ] ( https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/russian-aircraft-carrier-towed-home-after-break-down/ ) war is boring : [ your aircraft carrier is a piece of crap ] ( https://medium.com/war-is-boring/your-aircraft-carrier-is-a-piece-of-crap-f3f52d299588#.rpw2vt6yz ), 
   do you happen to know what is the annual growth rate of norway 's fund [ here as a graph in nok . 
  ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/c1fa9f108f864c4baa13fa35c767ddb8/market1_2015spu.jpg ) you can read about it on norwegian gov site [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/the-economy/the-government-pension-fund/government-pension-fund-global-gpfg/market-value-and-capital-inflow/id696852/ ) growth comes from two main pillars : investments gaining value , and new capital flowing into the fund . 
  last two quartes the fund has filed losses mostly due to investments in china losing value but it still remains the largest in the world and the losses are not significant in long term : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-28/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-suffers-biggest-loss-in-four-years  the $ 860 billion fund lost 273 billion kroner ( $ 32 billion ) in the third quarter , or 4.9 percent , the oslo-based investor said on wednesday . 
  its stock holdings declined 8.6 percent , while it posted a 0.9 percent gain on bonds and a 3 percent return on real estate . 
  it was the first back-to-back quarterly loss in six years . 
   `` we have to expect fluctuations in the value of the fund when there are large movements in the market , '' said yngve slyngstad , its chief executive officer . 
  `` with the fund as big as it is today , this can have a considerable impact in the short term . 
  the fund has a long-term horizon , however , and is in a good position to ride out short-term volatility . '' new capital is still flowing into the fund and the net flow is positive although it has slowed down due to low oil prices : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xnlibnz.png )  and what was it for russia 's before sanctions ? 
  [ graph of russia 's foreign exchange reserve 2013 to present . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/scapskt.png ) the reserve has lost roughly $ 150 bn and has shrunk from over $ 500 bn to current $ 365 bn . 
  remember that russia 's fx reserve consists of multiple components such as cash , gold and the reserve fund . 
  last year and earlier this year russia 's central bank burned through a lot of cash when defending the falling ruble . 
  also the russian gov has had to draw funds to finance the gov budget deficit due to low oil prices and sanctions stopping international financing . 
  the reserve fund is shrinking rapidly , has fallen to about $ 66bn , and could be gone next year : [ russia : key reserve fund to run dry by end of next year ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ef9af6dc1ffc42be8b352864dc2a45e8/russia-1-2-reserve-funds-run-dry-end-next-year ) as you can see the situation in russia is very different from norway . 
   russia does n't actually violate airspace , yes it does . 
  sometimes they have been even using military aircrafts pretending to be civilian traffic while violating the sovereign airspace of its neighbours . 
  and they have been willfully putting actual civilian traffic at risk by flying into busy airways with transponders off . 
   putin strengthened the state 's control over its assets to stop the ludicrous amount of robbery done via the privatization schemes us specialists suggested in the 90s . 
  good story bro . 
  while privatization was recommended by the relevant international institutions the hairbrained scheme how to do it was planned , decided , and implemented by russia - by russian experts and by russian politicians . 
  that was done against the recommendations , and russia was advised that their idea of how to do privatization was pretty much the worst . 
  and the results were pretty much just as disastrous as was expected . 
  the only one to blame for the idiotic manner the privatizations were done is russia . 
  yet russia would n't be russia if it did n't blame everyone else for their own failures . 
  norway has [ the world 's largest sovereign wealth fund worth about $ 855 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_wealth_fund#largest_sovereign_wealth_funds ) . 
  russia has nothing comparable to norway 's sovereign wealth fund . 
  what russia has is about $ 365 bn of foreign exchange reserves with most of it illiquid , already earmarked for different purposes , or tied up in wealth funds such as the reserve fund ( ~ $ 66bn ) and the national wealth fund ( ~ $ 74bn ) . 
  meanwhile the price of oil is falling to new lows , brent currently at 40.12 and falling : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6adjojf.jpg ) and also ruble is falling , it 's already close to 70 rub/usd : http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=rub&amp;view=1d, 
  the name sibelius comes from house called sibbe/sibbes in lapinj\u00e4rvi , finland . 
  that 's the house where juho '' sibbe '' matinpoika ( 1759-1820 ) lived . 
  his son johan `` sibbe '' juhonpoika ( 1785-1844 ) moved to loviisa , and later on adopted the name sibelius . 
  johan sibelius was the grandfather of jean sibelius . 
  here 's the genealogy of his family back to 16th century : http://www.sibelius.fi/suomi/suku_perhe/suku_sibelius.htm, 
  a typical low-effort comment by a three day old account . 
   is not wide to say that someone speaking russian is russian i think it is . 
  my friend speaks russian and she 's certainly not russian . 
  i speak english and i 'm certainly not english nor british . 
  and while i also speak swedish i 'm not swedish either . 
  to claim that speaking a language means you are also of that ethnicity is foolish . 
  what is `` russian '' anyway ? 
  when the russian gov claims to protect russian minorities outside its borders it seems that merely speaking russian means you 're russian , which is ridiculously wide definition . 
  but when russian citizens join terrorist organisation the definition of `` russian '' seems to suddenly become exceedingly narrow . 
   so basically common knowledge from the year 2010 . 
  certainly the actual numbers have changed since then , and those numbers likely vastly underestimate the actual numbers . 
  for example , in finland the number has probably doubled since 2010 . 
  facts are not a matter of world view but reality . 
  he probably refers to the fact that this year alone finland has received over 30000 asylym applicants , the vast majority of them being from iraq , somalia and afganistan which are predominantly muslim countries ( only about 500-600 from syria ) . 
  their presented number of 40000 muslims in finland underestimates the actual numbers . 
  and it 's actually their estimate from 2010 . 
  muslim population in finland has probably doubled since then . 
  the article says :  energy-hungry turkey relies on russia for 55 percent of its natural gas and 30 percent of its oil . 
  that 30 % does n't sound correct . 
  according to eia and the international energy agency ( iea ) oil from russia was 3 % in 2014 : [ fig . 
  turkey crude oil supply mix 2014 ] ( http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/turkey/images/crude_oil_supply_mix.png )  in 2014 , most of turkey 's crude oil imports came from iraq and iran ( figure 3 ) ,5 with each supplying slightly more than a quarter of the country 's crude oil . 
  the share of crude oil from russia , once the largest source country of turkey 's crude oil , has fallen as russian crude oil is increasingly being directed toward asian markets . 
  there already is one from 1989 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_winter_war_%28film%29#tv_series * it tells the story of a finnish infantry regiment `` jr 23 '' , which consists almost solely of men from southern ostrobothnia , focusing mainly on a platoon of reservists from kauhava . 
   russia has always had a more organic stake in the levant . 
  we have known since 2003 that [ putin is dobby . 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ymcwbfu4dxs/vlgsucd1lci/aaaaaaaajcm/guhww_91l5a/s1600/putin-and-dobby.jpg ) in 2003 , after the film * harry potter and the chamber of secrets * had premiered , russian lawyers were busy preparing a lawsuit : [ russian lawyers say harry potter character dobby is based on putin ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jan/30/harrypotter.news ) findlaw 's opinion on the matter : [ does putin have a case against the ` harry potter ' house elf ?

   well , he 'd be hard pressed to shoot it to europe from there . 
  how so ? 
  width of the bosphorus strait : 0.7-3 .4 km igla 's operational range : 5.2 km seems within range to me . 
  it 's a joke . 
  and a good one imo . 
  sometimes his jokes just go whoosh in r/europe . 
   i 'm saying absolutely nothing about the bcg report - only about the forbes article that draws certain conclusions from the report . 
  sounds like you 're claiming that forbes is misrepresenting the bcg report , but at the same time you do n't want to say anything about the bcg report . 
  what exactly is wrong in those `` certain conclusions '' of forbes and how are they not supported by the bcg report ? 
   according to them people of taiwan are twice as rich as russians are , and that sounds reasonable . 
  taiwan is an advanced economy producing high-added-value goods and having highly developed finacial sector , and i 'm quite sure that average taiwanese are wealthier than russians . 
  [ the credit suisse report ] ( https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileid=bcdb1364-a105-0560-1332ec9100ff5c83 ) says :  taiwan is a prime example of a successful asian tiger economy . 
  its average wealth is usd 151,800 , well above the level of even the most successful developing and transition countries , and close to some countries in western europe . 
  wealth rose from usd 107,000 in the year 2000 to usd 167,900 in 2010 , with no decline during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 . 
  currency depreciation caused a 12 % drop in wealth in usd in 2011 , but wealth stayed level in domestic currency terms and has since edged upwards again . 
  over the entire period 2000-13 , wealth per adult grew by 2.7 % per annum using current usd and by 4.3 % per year using constant exchange rates . 
  sounds correct to me .
