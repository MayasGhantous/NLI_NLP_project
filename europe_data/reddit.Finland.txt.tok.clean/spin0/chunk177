  \u2022 near kisik , two strikes struck an isil tactical unit and destroyed two isil fighting positions and an isil heavy machine gun . 
  \u2022 near ramadi , seven strikes struck two separate isil tactical units and destroyed four isil buildings , two isil command and control nodes , an isil staging area , an isil heavy machine gun , an isil fighting position , seven isil boats , an isil bed-down location , an isil out post , cratered an isil used road , and denied isil access to terrain . 
  \u2022 near sinjar , five strikes struck three separate isil tactical units and destroyed an isil vehicle , an isil fighting position , and suppressed an isil rocket position . 
  \u2022 near sultan abdallah , one strike struck an isil tactical unit and destroyed an isil fighting position . 
  \u2022 near tal afar , one strike struck an isil vehicle borne ied facility . 
  there 's plenty of videos available of tactical air strikes during battles as seen by the ground troops or by the aircraft . 
  here 's a video by ground troops from yesterday . 
  iraqi forces are attacking isis in ta\u2019amim ( ramadi ) with heavy air support : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4w9rk8gkdw location on map here : http://wikimapia.org/21496364/at-ta%c2%b4amim and here 's a map showing where 's everyone at in ramadi : http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ramadi%20control%20map%202015-11-11%20new.pdf, 
   the logic of using only airstrikes to fight them is pointless good thing then that it is not the logic behind the current strategy in which advancing ground troops supported by air strikes have been and are the essential part . 
   while the nov. 13 terror attacks in paris spurred several european nations to slam their doors to syrian refugees , finland has stuck to its calm and collected welcome . 
  in the context of finland i 'm kinda tired of everyone going on about syrian refugees . 
  of the over 30000 asylym seekers so far this year only about 500-600 are from syria . 
   while sweden raised its terror alert to the highest level after the attacks , the finnish security police refused an increase in finland . 
  the finnish security police does not have any terror alert levels , they do n't use those at all , and saying they ` refused ' to rise it is disingenuous . 
  so , instead of using alert levels the finnish security police threat assessment says the threat of terrorism has risen in finland : https://www.poliisi.fi/supo/terrorismintorjunnan_uhka-arvio, 
  heh , it sounds eerily like some marxist social engineering project with the purpose of creating a '' [ new soviet person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_soviet_man ) '' . 
  historically those have tended to lead to terrible results and failed to produce such ideal people as the ideology has dictated . 
  yet , marxist or not , the idea of not letting the kids compete is utterly stupid . 
   they do n't shoot them down because they know russia can be unstable in their response and that it is unnecessary . 
  most importantly nearest warzone is thousands of kilometers away from each of those countries . 
  turkey has a warzone right at its border . 
  border over which syria has made attacks . 
  the plane that was shot down did n't identify itself . 
  flying unidentified on a warzone is a bad idea if you 're supposed to be a friendly . 
  even worse idea is to fly unidentified on a warzone into other country 's airspace unannounced while disregarding instructions . 
  bad things will likely happen if you do that . 
  and happened . 
  the search and rescue effort was a military operation and a legit target . 
  based on the videos of the sar operation ( [ 1 ] ( http://syriancivilwararchive.com/videos/low-flying-russian-mi-8s-over-latakia-today.mp4 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://syriancivilwararchive.com/videos/tow-hit-on-helicopter-today-in-latakia.mp4 ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rogoqqeqal4 ) ) the helicopters were armed military helicopters , and were not displaying internationally recognized medical emblems or at least no such emblems were visible from the ground . 
  which means there is no basis for an argument that the helicopters were there to merely provide medical care . 
  should have been unarmed with visible emblems for such claim . 
  actually syria considers part of turkey 's territory as their own : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_province#turkish.e2.80.93syrian_dispute hatay is also the region where the shootdown happened . 
  we should get orban involved too . 
  right , they might start bombing hospitals and medical facilities . 
  oh but they are bombing those already : [ mapped : where airstrikes in syria are targeting medical workers ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/18/mapped-where-airstrikes-in-syria-are-targeting-medical-workers/?utm_content=bufferc731e&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer ), 
  yeah i saw those news and some videos on twitter . 
  also earlier today turkey denied the reports about halting flights . 
  well , it all sounded too good to be true . 
  crappy reporting . 
   and now they 've put their nastiest surface-to-air missile launcher in syria , glorious . 
  saying they will use it against any potential threat . 
  next up : a civilian airliner disappears from radar . 
  itt russian embassy already did . 
  su-24 is a variable sweep wing aircraft . 
  depending on the speed regime and altitude the wing sweep angles are 16 \u00b0 , 35 \u00b0 , 45 \u00b0 or 69 \u00b0 . 
  this gives it both very low landing speed ( 230 km/h ) and high max speed ( 1,654 km/h ) . 
  i do not know what the different speed regimes and altitudes are for each sweep setting , but to me it looks like the wings are set to low speed regime in the video . 
  so perhaps the 17 seconds estimate by the turkish authorities could be plausible . 
  but , as i said , i do not know what the relevant speed regimes exactly are . 
  given how little you seem to know about the opposition in syria it is no wonder you so easily buy into putin 's narrative , it 's designed to work like that . 
  no , reality is much more complex than that presumption . 
  for example these groups listed are not islamist : [ yes , there are 70,000 moderate opposition fighters in syria . 
  here 's what we know about them ] ( http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/yes-there-are-70000-moderate-opposition-fighters-in-syria-heres-what-we-know-about-them/ ) yes there is also islamist groups in syria , including the local al qaida , but those are different . 
  the myth that all opposition is islamist is the narrative that assad and putin love to push as they 're the ones the myth serves . 
  heh , good old robert fisk . 
  always low on facts , high on rhetorics and hot air . 
  one should not confuse his opinion pieces with factual reality . 
  let 's see what an actual expert has to say about the matter he has studied for past two years : [ yes , there are 70,000 moderate opposition fighters in syria . 
  here 's what we know about them ] ( http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/yes-there-are-70000-moderate-opposition-fighters-in-syria-heres-what-we-know-about-them/ ) [ relevant table ] ( http://cdn2.spectator.co.uk/files/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-26-at-19.38.51.png ), 
   stable, 
   `` we very sincerely recommend to russia not to play with fire , '' erdogan told supporters during a speech in bayburt , in northeast turkey . 
  pretty short soundbite by reuters . 
  i found [ the full quote ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-president-erdogan-warns-russia-not-to-play-with-fire.aspx?pageid=517&amp;nid=91768&amp;newscatid=352 ) much more interesting :  `` [ russian president vladimir ] putin says ` those who have double standards on terrorism are playing with fire . ' i totally agree with him , '' erdo\u011fan said nov. 27 in the northern province of bayburt . 
   `` indeed , supporting the [ bashar ] al-assad regime in syria , which has killed 380,000 people , is playing with fire . 
  striking opposition groups that have international legitimacy with the excuse of fighting against daesh [ an acronym of the islamic state of iraq and the levant , isil ] is playing with fire . 
  using an incident in which turkey 's righteousness is accepted by the whole world as an excuse to torment our citizens who were in russia to attend a fair is playing with fire . 
  irresponsibly hitting trucks in the region that are there for trade or humanitarian reasons is playing with fire . 
  we sincerely advise russia not to play with fire , '', 
  right , you did n't . 
  i said that because that 's what it is : a conspiracy theory . 
   always hear both sides . 
  right , and we have the reason to believe him because ? 
  yes for example syria . 
  turkey has all the reasons to consider them as a threat based on syria 's past behavior . 
   meanwhile , my guess is this has been a trap set up by nato in that nato encouraged turkey to shoot down some russian aircraft on next occasion . 
  ah , it 's a conspiracy , and not a failure by the russian fighter jets who failed to communicate , to identify themselves , and to follow the instructions given to them . 
  no , it 's nato to blame here . 
  it 's a conspiracy . 
   are you serious right now ? 
  yes , he is . 
  and he is also correct . 
   http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/7/russian-bombers-penetrated-us-airspace-least-16-ti/   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/full-list-of-incidents-involving-russian-military-and-nato-since-march-2014-9851309.html   http://freebeacon.com/national-security/russia-violates-u-s-airspace/ you and those headlines are confused . 
  entering adiz ( air defense identification zone ) is not the same thing as violating country 's sovereign airspace . 
  sovereign airspace is limited by the borders or territorial waters surrounding country . 
  and breaching that is a violation of sovereign airspace and that 's what has been discussed itt . 
  adiz is often a large airspace that is outside of the proper sovereign airspace . 
  they are not defined by international treaties and countries establish them as they see fit and are able to have control over . 
  the purpose of an adiz is to work as a sort of buffer for monitoring incoming air traffic . 
  it 's an area where an approaching unidentified aircraft gets intercepted , identified and then possibly escorted out long before it has a chance to enter the sovereign airspace . 
  your links show russian planes entering the us adiz and getting intercepted , identified and escorted out . 
  that is not the same thing as violation of sovereign airspace . 
  and get destroyed in the process . 
  does n't look like a winner in that . 
   is n't that the opposite position of the ` turkey was right to shoot down the russian jet ' - crowd ? 
  do n't know about that . 
  but now it appears that the opposite of what some were advocating itt is happening and looks like de-escalation is taking place : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ugand/turkey_suspends_syria_flights_after_crisis_with/ sounds good if true . 
   russia has quite significantly increased yes , everyone and their dog has been aware of that . 
  i 'm more interested on what is happening right now and next . 
  so , turkey withholds their flights over syria . 
  and russia stops their airstrikes near the border .
