  until comm links re-established . 
  and this by a mutual understanding . 
  sounds good , sounds like de-escalation . 
  i do n't get it . 
  is russia increasing flights near the turkish border or not ? 
   it turns out that turkey is the one suspending flights in syria , and russia the one increasing flights near the turkish border . 
  actually your posted source says that this `` was in fact a mutual decision taken with russia , which also halted its aerial campaigns near the turkish border . '', 
   distortions such as ? 
  why do n't you read your own link . 
   nominal gdp is meaningless , it is certainly not `` meaningless '' . 
  it is the metric representing the economic output , performance and size of the economy . 
  and that is the correct metric to use here . 
   two exact same cars in italy and russia are valued differently but in real terms they 're worth exactly the same . 
  irrelevant as we 're not comparing prices of cars but the sizes and output of the economies . 
  russia and turkey are not at war . 
  i said there is a war going on over there , with spillovers to neighboring countries . 
  the war started about four years ago . 
  have n't you heard about it ? 
  i know wikipedia is not very good source but here 's a link to quickly get you up to speed : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war, 
  * your own source * says gdp ppp sucks at making comparisons you 're purporting to make here . 
  it 's not designed for that and easily creates distortions . 
  it is not a measure of a country 's economic power . 
  no , it is the relevant metric when comparing the size of the economies . 
  it is actually your metric that sucks at such comparison : gdp ppp represents the average purchasing power of people , not the size of the economy . 
  it 's even clearly stated in your linky :  it is however limited when comparing the size of national economies ; gdp ppp is designed to compare the purchasing power of the citizens of one country against those of another country rather than the total size of national economies . 
  [ 2 ] it could be argued that purchasing power and economic size are not very closely related and hence relying upon gdp ppp when comparing national economies , as opposed to the metric 's intended purpose of comparing citizens ' consumption of goods and services , can create distortions . 
   russia is stronger militarily and economically than italy , no idea where you got that . 
  sizes of their economies . 
  russia gdp 2014 : [ $ 1860.60 bn ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp ) ( and falling ) italy gdp 2014 : [ $ 2144.34 bn ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp ) ( and growing ), 
  so let 's make the situation worse ? 
  is that it ? 
   turkish prime minister ahmet davuto\u011flu said nov. 25 the best before date of the statement may have passed . 
  in what way would that improve anything ? 
   how can shooting down a fighter jet in times of peace there is actually a war going on over there . 
  been all over the news for years already . 
   it 's not like there would be an open conflict already and turkey would have had to expect an attack from this single jet during the still ongoing war syria has attacked turkish territory , which btw syria claims it as their own , and there has been numerous clashes , bombings , aircraft shootdowns and other incidents on both sides of the border : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian%e2%80%93turkish_border_clashes_%282012%e2%80%9314%29, 
  ah , so it 's only about measuring micropenises and not about actually improving anything . 
  sounds like a great strategy . 
   the european sanctions are more for show , not really effective , and likely to be lifted soon . 
  news from the past week : [ western leaders agreed to extend russia sanctions by six months : diplomat ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/21/us-eu-russia-sanctions-iduskcn0ta0xh20151121 ) [ eu preparing to extend russia sanctions for six months ] ( https://euobserver.com/foreign/131219 ), 
  why would russia do that ? 
  in what way would that improve anything ? 
  now that 's a great collection of relevant info on one page . 
  bookmarked , and thanks for the link . 
  and yeah , unless something dramatic happens in world oil supply and demand , next year 's oil prices will likely average significantly below $ 60 or even around $ 50 . 
   barclays themselve came up with a forecast that oil price is likely to rise to $ 50 by the end of 2015 and increase to $ 60 in 2016 . 
  so with that forecast the average price for 2016 would be between $ 50-60 . 
  that 's way below the $ 67.2 which i pointed out to be too optimistic , and it seems barclays forecast supports my point . 
   while the uae themselves were bullish and confident enough to think that oil could reach 60 by the end next year . 
  again giving us an average of below $ 60 . 
  again seems to support my point that $ 67.2 is too optimistic . 
  there 's nothing retarted in recognizing what contango is and how it is related to the futures prices . 
  in short : the current 2016 brent futures prices wo n't hold over time as the trading volumes grow . 
  go ahead , try disputing that with facts . 
  surely belarus will soon start exporting their local traditional kebab . 
   the co-pilot ( navigator ) even said they have n't crossed turkish territory at all . 
  and we have the reason to believe him because ? 
   also i 'm wondering by whom turkey felt threatened ? 
  for example syria . 
  that was the reason turkey changed their roe . 
   so whatever cocky rules of engagement turkey might consider righteous , she is still bound to international law . 
  if this incident will make it to international courts turkey wo n't stand a chance . 
  that would be an interesting case indeed . 
  but i would n't be as certain about the outcome as you seem to be - we do n't even have all the facts of the case . 
  it 's the [ montreux convention regarding the regime of the straits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits ) . 
  basically turkey can close the straits to foreign warships in wartime or when it is threatened by aggression , and to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with turkey . 
   steps of standard aircraft interception protocol turkey is not using `` standard aircraft interception protocol '' whatever that may mean . 
  there is a war going on right at the border . 
  the war and related incidents , such as shooting down a turkish fighter jet , have convinced turkey to change their roe accordingly . 
  their roe reflects the realities of a war , in peacetime it would probably be more akin to `` standard '' . 
  if russia was violating turkey 's airspace believing that turkey had a `` standard '' roe in effect , then they were unfortunately mistaken . 
  but considering how vocal and public turkey has been about its roe , including warning both syria and russia several times and even shooting down a syrian fighter jet , i do not believe for a second that russia was somehow unaware of the roe . 
  believe me , having lived in its neighbour the ussr had often the same feel . 
  i mean , in 1985 the ussr even cooked up a diplomatic crisis over a * fucking game review * in a finnish computer magazine . 
  no , really . 
  in feb 1985 a finnish computer magazine mikrobitti had published a positive review of computer game [ * raid over moscow * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_over_moscow ) . 
  first some finnish communists went apeshit . 
  then the soviet embassy went batshit insane . 
  they claimed the game was war propaganda with the purpose of molding public opinion favourable for a future `` space war '' against the soviet union . 
  yeah , really . 
  they claimed the review was `` one of the most outrageus anti-soviet provocations in finland after wwii '' , and `` if the sale and advertizing of the game in question continues in finland , the soviet union through its ambassador will officially in the most severe way call for finnish government 's attention to this outrageus incident . '', 
  then the soviet union produced a list of finnish books , articles and other media that had discussed matters embarassing to the ussr such as the occupation and russification of estonia , invasion of afganistan , the red army 's current state etc. 
  including the game raid over moscow . 
  they also called again for finnish government to ban it . 
  they did n't . 
  the finnish gov responded that there is no legal basis for such ban and the law only allows banning products that may pose a physical danger to children 's health . 
  needless to say with the publicity the game itself became a best seller in finland topping the charts for months . 
  and that 's how the finnish public opinion became favourable for a space war against the soviet union . 
  interesting read , thanks for posting . 
   regarding the russian marine killed on the rescue operation , the law is more complex . 
  generally , a rescue effort is a military operation subject to lawful attack . 
  if , however , the aircraft was displaying the red cross or a similar internationally recognized medical emblem , and the aim was simply to provide medical care , the attack would likely be unjustified . 
  based on the videos ( [ 1 ] ( http://syriancivilwararchive.com/videos/low-flying-russian-mi-8s-over-latakia-today.mp4 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://syriancivilwararchive.com/videos/tow-hit-on-helicopter-today-in-latakia.mp4 ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rogoqqeqal4 ) ) of the helicopters participating in the sar effort we already have an answer to that one : they were not displaying internationally recognized medical emblems , or at least no such emblems were visible from ground . 
   $ 67.2 per barrel seems overtly optimistic to me . 
  they have simply taken the brent futures prices and averaged them . 
  but futures prices are in contango , and they get lower as each month passes . 
  therefore the current futures prices wo n't hold , and realistically the average of $ 67.2 wo n't likely happen . 
  that is unless something dramatic happens in world oil supply and demand . 
  no , russia and turkey are not at war with each other but that 's not the issue here . 
  the thing is : as there is war going on over there it has had obvious implications to turkey 's roe .
