  so they wo n't buy more gas now , and hence they wo n't make a payment for it . 
  it 's possible they 'll need more gas later on next spring . 
  then they will pay upfront . 
   it was pretty obvious that it was a russian plane how was that obvious and to whom ? 
  the two planes were not responding to calls and were unidentified . 
  of course it 's possible to assume that the unidentified planes were russian and that could even be the likely asumption , but it 's not the obvious conclusion until after the fact . 
   and that it had no intention of attacking turkey though ? 
  then they probaby should have kept out of turkey 's airspace in the first place . 
  turkey changed their roe in 2012 after syria had shot down a turkish fighter jet . 
  turkey has been very public about their new roe , includig informing russia several times after their earlier incursions into turkish airspace . 
  yet for some reason the russian fighters disregarded all that and once again violated turkish airspace . 
  which is reckless - as is shooting one of them down . 
  i find this composition more accurate even with its quick & dirty look : http://s14.postimg.org/slflegf1t/comp.jpg, 
  * a passenger jet goes missing in the eastern mediterranean *, 
   well , every country does that . 
  no they do n't . 
  a headline from the near future : passenger jet gone missing in eastern mediterranean - missile strike suspected, 
   so how does it work ? 
  is there an international frequency that every single pilot listens to ? 
  yes , there 's internationally agreed aircraft emergency frequency a.k.a. 
  guard . 
   what is his point then ? 
  his point is exactly what he says . 
   but do you really think the kind of people who lacks empathy , respect and human decency to the point where they 'd violate someone 's body is really going to turn up to a consent lesson on a university campus ? 
  they wo n't . 
  and that is correct . 
  they wo n't . 
  yet even there he does not say what you claimed or more precisely what you * imagined * . 
   which implies that no , it does n't . 
  again you 're merely * imagining * things instead of being rational and sticking to the facts . 
   and that actually is a very problematic statement to make except he did n't make such statement . 
  you just simply * imagined * that he did . 
  charles de gaulle was operating in the gulf previously ( feb-april ) .

  no thanks,

  there 's even a sub for that : https://www.reddit.com/r/ankdammen, 
  nope , it 's a crackpot blog . 
  not a valid source for anything but occasional laughs . 
  uss harry s. truman ( cvn-75 ) has already left norfolk and will join the coalition forces in the me . 
  obviously there 's no info on when it will be in the gulf . 
  [ carrier uss harry s. truman to deploy to middle east on monday ] ( http://news.usni.org/2015/11/13/carrier-uss-harry-s-truman-to-deploy-to-middle-east-on-monday ) it 's exceptional not to have a carrier in the gulf especially now that it 's very much needed . 
  apparently this short gap of couple of months ( hopefully ) is because of maintenance back-log : [ carrier uss theodore roosevelt leaves middle east , no firm date on replacement to continue anti-isis strikes ] ( http://news.usni.org/2015/10/13/carrier-uss-theodore-roosevelt-chops-out-of-u-s-5th-fleet-no-firm-date-on-replacement-to-continue-anti-isis-strikes ),

  and none of your quotes confirms your fictional claim that he is an `` isis supporter '' . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  additionally , we both already know who runs sohr and where . 
  you do n't need to google quotes about that and prentend they somehow support your silly claim of him being an `` isis supporter '' . 
  he is not . 
   that abdulrahman , real name osama ali suleiman , receives all his infos via phone from syria , since he was n't once in syria since over 13 years , is and ever was an unproven claim . 
  even the un stopped to differ in countings between civilians , forces and groups because `` its not possible to accurate differ '' . 
  like i said he is very well connected in syria . 
  and none of that contradicts it . 
  sohr is much more than just one guy . 
   read up about him and his one-man show sohr `` organization '' . 
  uhm , you linked to a wordpress blog post from 2012 . 
  it 's a heavily biased delusional pro-assad , pro-russia , conspiracy site that supports not only assad but also ` novorussia ' and russia . 
  that guy even claims that the recent terrorist attacks in paris were `` a false flag operation '' , and says to have come to this conclusion `` immediately '' :  if , like me , you immediately realized that these paris terror killings were a false flag operation , you really should vet your sources better . 
   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_observatory_for_human_rights   `` the united kingdom-based sohr is run out of a two-bedroom terraced home in coventry by one person , rami abdulrahman , [ 3 ] a syrian sunni muslim who also runs a clothes shop ''   hahahahahaha . 
  read up on that `` source '' . 
  hes a known islam extremist and isis supporter . 
  he is not an isis supporter . 
  your problem is using wikipedia as your source and taking it as kosher and all there is to know . 
  there is very little reporting from daesh controlled areas because they have beheaded journalists , observers and reporters , and are actively preventing reporting from there . 
  sohr is one the very very few sources providing reports from there . 
  sohr is very well connected in syria and reports provided by it are based on observations by a large network of people in syria . 
  it is much more than just one guy selling clothes in coventry . 
  the reliability of sohr reports varies , and they should be taken with grain of salt just like any other reporting from there . 
  but also many times they 're reasonably accurate , and should not be simply dismissed by making false claims of sohr being an `` isis supporter '' . 
  yes , i wrote that with tongue in cheek and certainly it would not be that simple . 
  but , as you say , there is a serious point in there . 
  knowing daesh ideology and beliefs and using that knowledge against them would be very wise when fighting them . 
  that could help tactically or sometimes even strategically ( e.g. 
  you mean before or after [ the ethnic cleansing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_south_ossetia ) ? 
   also france 's direct answer has been to bomb raqqa with its 500.000 inhabitants arguebly not the best strategic choice in terms of reducing civil victims . 
  reportedly the french air strikes to raqqa caused 3 civilian victims in a fire . 
  and as everywhere in daesh controlled areas far far more civilians die in the hands of daesh than by air strikes . 
   however , bombing is inadvertibly indiscriminatory towards whether a civilian is present or not . 
  by bombing daesh we will without a doubt hit civilians . 
  yes , civilian victims will inevitably happen . 
  what the coalition has been doing is to try and minimise them by careful target selection and precision . 
  also , when bombing for example oil facilities workers on the ground are warned to get out of there . 
  russians and the assad government have been less delicate about target selection and civilian victims bombing populated areas . 
  this example from about a week ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3rvjqa/video_showing_the_aftermath_of_russian_air_attack/ another : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3szvd9/names_of_the_84_civilians_killed_in_the_albukamal/ but , as said , even with careful targeting and precision collateral damage and civilian victims inevitably do happen in bombings . 
  airwars.org tries to keep track on civilian victims . 
  here 's their estimate regarding the coalition airstrikes from aug 2014 to nov 16th 2015 : http://airwars.org/civilian-casualty-claims/  it is our provisional view at airwars that between 653 and 932 civilian non-combatants are likely to have been killed in 108 incidents where there is fair reporting publicly available of an event , and where coalition strikes were confirmed in the near vicinity on that date . 
   we should clean up europe before cleaning up the middle east . 
  i think we should fight daesh * both * in europe * and * in the me . 
  those are not mutually exclusive options . 
  and as daesh is establishing terrorist cells worldwide , i think we should also fight them worldwide . 
  not just one spot at a time . 
  there are far more children with their parents murdered or enslaved by daesh than there is collateral damage . 
   daesh is creating the story of west versus muslims and by bombing them we help them to tell their story . 
  we become recruiters to their cause and that is their goal .
