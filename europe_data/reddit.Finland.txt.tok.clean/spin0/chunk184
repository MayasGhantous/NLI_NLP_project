  in its first two reports , uniiic indicated that the syrian government may be linked to the assassination . 
  defense lawyers tasked with prosecuting those responsible for the 2005 bombing said they had received evidence linking bashar assad 's phone to the case . 
   their martyrdom is not related to publishing their real name . 
  the martyrs care about going to heaven and the leadership cares of fullfilling their agenda . 
  you have n't seen isis martyrdom videos , have you ? 
  identity is very relevant in them . 
  it 's a very good giveaway that a person has absolutely no idea what hes talking about . 
   hezbollah - us , uk , can , il ( no un , only us + their puppets ) and france , the gulf cooperation council , australia , bahrain , and the netherlands . 
  additionally the european union , new zealand and the uk have classified hezbollah 's military wing as a terrorist organization . 
   no un let 's not forget that russia has a seat in the security council . 
  there have been instances where russia has been watering down or threatening to veto sc resolutions on hezbollah . 
  yet there is absolutely no doubt about hezbollah being an islamist terrorist organization . 
  it was created in the '80s as a offshoot of iran 's islamic revolution , and its networks , terrorist plots , and killings have long been global . 
   al-nusra front - un , rus , us , uk , can all in all the united nations security council , france , australia , uk , canada , saudi arabia , new zealand , united arab emirates , russia , and turkey . 
   tell more more about that actual analysis ? 
  the best article i have come across , and i have read quite numerous , is this essay by david ignatius : [ how isis spread in the middle east - and how to stop it ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/how-isis-started-syria-iraq/412042/ ) the essay gives a very detailed analysis on how isis came to be . 
  it 's a long and carefully detailed read , but that is necessary because there actually is a lot to say , and it 's refreshing to read an assessment that does not cut corners by leaving something essential out . 
  ignatius ' essay , especially his proposed strategies to counter isis , sparked well thought out responses which are also very interesting to read : [ a syria-first strategy for defeating isis ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/syria-strategy-defeat-isis/414295/ ) * protecting civilians from assad is the first step toward the settlement david ignatius deems essential . 
  * [ the hidden danger of safe zones in syria ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/safe-zone-syria-conflict/415134/ ) * david ignatius calls for creating protected areas to save civilians from assad and isis . 
  but doing so may put the vulnerable at even greater risk . 
  * [ is there a sunni solution to isis ? 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/isis-sunni-iraq-anbar/413782/ ) * david ignatius calls for reconciliation among iraqi sunnis , shiites , and kurds . 
  but this oversimplifies the bargain that needs to be struck . 
  * and finally , ignatius ' response to them : [ ` how isis spread in the middle east ' : the response - it 's sunnis who ultimately hold the key to defeating the islamic state . 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/isis-syria-iraq-david-ignatius/415842/ ) even if you do n't agree with ignatius ' proposed solutions the articles are well worth reading for they give an informative and accurate analysis on relevant isis history . 
  and they show the complexity of the intertwined problems and the level of nyance needed to even accurately describe them never mind to solve them . 
   did n't they just lose an important military base or something ? 
  yes , isis has been losing a lot lately both in syria and iraq . 
  * opens an incognito window * okay , i 'll be in my bunk doing my part . 
   it 's a fact , and an obvious one . 
  no , it is not a fact , far from it : it 's shallow truthiness , and not even a beginning of an actual analysis . 
   western politic is infact responsible for the very existence of the is . 
  that truthiness is not true . 
  what is true is that better thought out us policies could have stopped isis earlier . 
  yet that does not mean they are responsible for its existence . 
  calls for unity against ` terrorism ' , uses his airforce to support internationally classified islamist terrorist group hezbollah . 
   so where 's all the money coming from to fund all this ideology ? 
  estimates vary but isis * own income * from oil , extortion , robbery , ransom etc is at least billion a year . 
  they do n't need gulf state money , and they are not financed by gulf states . 
   bbw world big beautiful women world ? 
   but how do you act decisively if your enemy is basically a hydra with stealth capabilities ? 
  there is no single simple answer or a silver bullet to that . 
  one needs to employ multiple methods at many levels .

  if nothing else they show the complexity of the intertwined problems and the level of nyance needed to even accurately describe them never mind to solve them . 
   hezbollah is a terrorist organization . 
  too bad twitter links are banned in comments in / r/europe . 
  that 's currently one of the best places to get quick updates on breaking news . 
  you must be new here . 
  executivemonkey has been known for years for his toungue in cheek commentary in these parts . 
   to make my residency in europe permanent . 
  i hear it 's pretty difficult if you 're someone who has come to eu legally with real documentation and permits . 
  in light of recent events it seems simply throwing away your passport and just walking into a country of your liking is the way to go . 
   i 've argued that the establishment of organisations like isis was inescapeable as a result of the total decimation of the middle east and how the people there see themselves as unfairly treated by ( among others ) the western world . 
  and therefore they proceeded to genocide and enslave the yazidis ? 
  because they feel unfairly treated by the west ? 
  hey , it 's `` the most important international police operation in europe in 20 years . '' :d, 
  yeah , such political oppression and persecution is the reasoning behind asylym system for the victims . 
  but this guy is certainly not a victim but a murderer , torturer and terrorist . 
  granting him an asylym is mocking his victims . 
   i 'm afraid you 're overlooking the fact that anyone who lives under oppressive regime can be convicted based on coerced confessions or false accusations . 
  this is political asylum 101 : an oppressive state can not be trusted whatsoever . 
  are you serioulsy implying that mullah krekar did nothing wrong ? 
  that him being wanted in iraq for his crimes is just political oppression ? 
  look , in 2001 he became a leader of a islamist terrorist group ansar al-islam with close ties with osama bin laden and al qaeda . 
  here 's what they did in iraq , relevant background info by stanford : [ mapping militant organizations - ansar al-islam ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/13 )  ansar al-islam targeted a range of different ethnic , political , and religious groups after its inception in 2001 . 
  initially the majority of its attacks were directed against the puk , which controlled the area of iraqi kurdistan where ai was based . 
  [ 78 ] [ 79 ] within its sphere of control in the hawraman region of iraqi kurdistan , ai targeted puk supporters as well as naqshbandi sufis and any sunnis who did not subscribe to ai 's vision of islam . 
  ** ai instituted measures such as the requiring women to wear veils , segregating the sexes , banning all education for and employment of women , confiscating all musical instruments and televisions , and mandating attendance at mosques . 
  those who failed to comply with these laws were subject to the historical practices of amputation , flogging , decapitation , and stoning . 
  [ 80 ] additionally reports surfaced of other forms of torture employed by ai in the areas under its control , including pouring acid on the skin of political prisoners and women who dressed in a manner considered immodest . 
  ** the group also purportedly experimented with larger scale chemical attacks , particularly with ricin and cyanide gas . 
  [ 81 ] he was certainly not a simple oppressed imam but a leader of a dangerous murderous terrorist group . 
  he is responsible for murder and torture of numerous civilians . 
  in 2003 the joint us&puk offensive against ansar al-islam temporarily expelled the terrorist group from iraq . 
  the leader mullah krekar escaped to norway where by some utterly idiotic decision this known terrorist was granted an asylym , and he remains there to this day despite being wanted in iraq for his crimes . 
   i am sure this has happened many times over already and it looks like it is not going to stop in the foreseeable future . 
  yes , this is what i think about it too . 
  then there 's another negative effect : as more money is funneled to housing and benefits for the asylym applicants , less money is left to help the people remaining in the troubled regions . 
  [ un alarmed by swedish development aid cuts ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20151112/un-alarmed-by-swedish-development-aid-cuts ) additionally , what we should do right now is to seriously invest time , political capital , money , and effort ( including possibly military effort ) to stop the spread of islamist terror groups in africa . 
  it has to be done sooner or later , and the longer we let it spread the bigger the problem gets . 
  it 's not going to go away by itself . 
  iirc you 're from illinois ? 
  how does the asylym system work in the us ? 
  how often do people from mea appear in the us without documentation and apply for asylym ? 
   well at least you `` feel '' good at the end of the day yeah , obviously some may believe they 're doing `` good '' and feel good about themselves . 
   but what is happening in europe right now makes a mockery of a system that was designed to help the most vulnerable people in the world . 
  so many times this . 
  i do support a system where we help people in need as we can - including giving an asylym to those who really need such . 
  but what is happening now and indeed for over a decade already is not how it 's supposed to work : helping the most vulnerable . 
  and now the whole system is on the verge of collapsing if it have n't already . 
  but at least some get their feels of `` good '' and then proceed to pat themselves on their backs while ostracizing others for not being as `` good '' people as they are .
