  what we are looking at is a confict between modernism and medievalism . 
  that 's at the core of ongoing conflicts in the middle east and that 's what 's spreading to europe from there . 
  and instead of stopping it , fighting it , we 're importing these guys and housing them and giving them asylyms here in europe . 
  people who are hell bent to wage a war against us including murdering civilians over here . 
  because `` human rights '' and stuff . 
  none of it makes any sense at any level . 
   we can not be complicit in allowing torture and murder . 
  yet we 're doing exactly that by giving asulym to a known terrorist who has come to europe to wage war against us including murdering civilians and to spread his twisted ideology . 
  nothing of value would be lost if that guy is sent back to iraq where he is accused of serious crimes . 
  and what they do with him is their business . 
  the thing that many still do n't seem to understand is that there is a war going on . 
  you should n't house and give asylym to someone who comes to your country to wage a war including murdering civilians . 
  no amount of cultural relativity makes that a sane thing to do .

   is n't sweden pretty much their end goal ? 
  many continue to norway ad finland . 
  so far about 30000 has come to finland from sweden , mostly young men from iraq and somalia and only about 200-300 syrians . 
  they even get a free ride on swedish railways to finnish border . 
  flashbangs still are n't `` lethal force '' . 
  had the police actually used lethal force on the crowd you 'd see many dead and seriously injured . 
  because that 's what * lethal force * is . 
  wow . 
  now your post is gone too . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  from the tweets :  the police are now using lethal force , concussion grenades thrown at #refugees in the #calais camp . 
  flashbangs are not `` lethal force '' . 
  wow . 
  i got such message just now too . 
  actually , in my case that 's fair , but not in yours . 
  when i made the post it said someone else had already posted the link . 
  that was your post , which was the first one . 
  but when i went back to double-check / r/europe/new your post was nowhere to be found . 
  so no-one could read the news , and no-one could post the news either . 
  that 's why i decided to post it despite the notice of a repost . 
  yet there was no notification whatsoever about it . 
  the post just never appeared as if it had never been posted . 
  strange . 
  amazing . 
  [ i posted this exact same link about 20 minutes earlier ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sg4pv/sweden_to_introduce_border_controls_at_noon/ ) , but it never showed up in / r/europe . 
  good !, 
  your hate has made you powerful . 
  now , fulfill your destiny . 
   isis has professional videographers running around with top of the line gear . 
  and they also publish videos shot with phones , and obviously not every isis video is shot by a professional with pro equipment . 
  furthermore the group which claimed responsibility and upoaded the videos is not isis but an affiliated militant group sinai province . 
  i have no idea what kind of video equipment they prefer to use , and i guess you do n't either . 
  the group pledged allegiance to the is a year ago and changed its name from supporters of jerusalem to sinai province . 
  and they have been running a bombing campaing in sinai and in egypt since last july . 
  the video not being shot with pro equipment tells us nothing about its authenticity . 
   most mobile phones use a wide angle fixed focal length optic with digital zoom , typically in the region of 28mm . 
  try to take video of an airliner flying at cruising altitude with your own phone . 
  digital zoom or not : it 's not going to happen . 
  one could easily do that with cheap accessory optics . 
  that 's my whole point : it is possible , and not even difficult . 
   however i 'm 99,9 % sure that the video is a fake , and likely not even released by isis , but some teenage troll or some isis sympathizer loser . 
  while i have my doubts about the authenticity of the videos , i 'm not as certain as you seem to be . 
  there are also things speaking for their authenticity , for example : how did the author of the videos know that an explosion brought the plane down ? 
  and why there is an explosion on rear left side ? 
  how did he know this mere hours after the crash before there were even photos published of the wreckage ? 
   allowed to bride the judges and marry their cousins . 
   there 's no way the plane would appear so large on the wide-angle lens of a cellphone camera . 
  there is a wide selection of easily available accessory optics for phones , just for one example : [ 6x-18x optical zoom mobile phone telescope lens + tripod + plastic case for iphone hanoi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m0nwhkguy0 ) and with an optical lens there 's still the option of using digital zoom as well . 
  say you have a 12x optical zoom lens , then if you use digital zoom you 'll multiply your total zoom level : with 2x digital you 'll get 12 * 2 = 24x total zoom , and with 4x you 'll get 48x etc. 
   the convenient shaky-cam effect , potato quality and out-of-focus effect . 
  to me it looks pretty much like someone using an optical zoom with tripod is struggling with following the plane . 
  add some digital zoom and poor quality optics and you 'll have the rest ( potato quality and out-of-focus ) . 
  isis-affiliated militant group sinai province claimed responsibility some hours after the incident by posting [ a message ] ( https://twitter.com/terror_monitor/status/660457114914148352 ) and [ a video allegedly showing the plane falling ] ( https://vimeo.com/144222415 ) . 
  the group claimed to have `` brought down '' the aircraft . 
  they never said how but some took it to mean by missile , even as the terrorists did n't claim that , and were very quick to dismiss the claim including egypt and russia . 
  for example , jerusalem post/reuters oct 31 : [ isis affiliate in egypt says downed russian plane in sinai ; moscow denies claim ] ( http://www.jpost.com/middle-east/isis-affiliate-in-sinai-claims-responsibility-for-downing-russian-plane-430620 ) days later the group repeated their claim : [ islamic state affiliate in egypt insists it brought down russian plane ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/04/us-egypt-crash-islamicstate-iduskcn0st1o920151104 ), 
   even the anonymous source does n't say that there is certain belief that it was a bomb , so i do n't really understand what your complaints are at the moment . 
  my `` complaints at the moment '' are already described above . 
  it 's mainly the poor communication by the investigation and by the investigation head in particular . 
   do you expect unconfirmed speculations to be published ? 
  and that is exactly my problem . 
  we hear from leaks only . 
  we should be able to hear from the investigation instead . 
  but they have had just * one * single presser in * a week * , where the head of investigation answered to total of * two questions * . 
  and at this point the bomb-theory is hardly mere `` unconfirmed speculations '' but a likely possibility . 
   i saw this mentioned in the telegraph live blog a day or two after the crash , but seems it 's been almost completely ignored , which i ca n't understand . 
  the video ( with two videos of a falling aircraft ) was posted on youtube some hours after the crash . 
  i do n't know when exactly it was posted there and the account was quickly closed by youtube . 
  i first saw a link to the video maybe six hours after the crash ( iirc ) but by then the account was already closed . 
   maybe because when it was released most people were still thinking there 's no way isis could have shot the plane down , they do n't have the weapons . 
  the terrorists claimed to have `` brought down '' the aircraft . 
  some probably took it to mean by a missile . 
  yes , obviously investigation and reaching final conclusions takes time , and will be published in a report at some point in the future . 
  but it 's not the final conclusions i 'm talking about . 
  there 's lots of other things the investigation has failed to communicate so far , and did it again yesterday . 
  just some for example : how big is the wreckage area ? 
  which parts of the aircraft are still missing ? 
  where is the right horizontal stabiliser ? 
  where is the rudder ? 
  how many victims have been found ? 
  how many have been identified ? 
  what were their causes of death ? 
  etc , etc the there 's another important thing to consider : the purpose of the investigation . 
  as per the annex 13 of the convention on international civil aviation : * `` the sole objective of the investigation of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and incidents . 
  it is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame or liability . 
  '' * prevention of accidents and incidents .
