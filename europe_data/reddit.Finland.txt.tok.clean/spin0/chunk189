  actually it has . 
  here 's a quote from the article :  `` sara '' said she was forced to get engaged to her cousin when she was just 13 by her deeply christian family and her parents made her undergo a virginity test at 15 . 
  in the documentary it is mentioned that `` sara '' is from iraq . 
  the article is based on this documentary by swedish tv4 : http://www.tv4play.se/program/kalla-fakta?video_id=3209750 in the documentary they say they want to create as realistic scenario as possible using actresses and hidden cameras to see how the doctors react . 
  this involves using three actresses : the victim , a family member demanding a virginity check , and an interpreter . 
  the family member also claims to have been in the country for only three years . 
  the fact that they use an interpreter tells us that the most realistic scenario is not that native swedes go to virginity checks but immigrants that are in need of an interpreter . 
  then they go to a doctor pretending they 're from iran and the doctor tells having performed such procedures also to girls from iraq and saudi arabia . 
  edit : it 's also relevant to note that the practice of checking the condition of the mythical hymen is not limited to only those countries or regions . 
  it 's wide-spread and practiced in many places around the world from indonesia to middle-east to africa , and in some places in europe too . 
   plenty of legal things can turn into evidence ah , that 's probably the case here . 
  thanks for the info . 
  is n't ownership of nazi regalia banned in germany ? 
  and if not then why did the police confiscate it ? 
  xnicolex is referring to the more recent school shooting in umpqua community college , oregon . 
  i remember seeing that particular video in reddit . 
  just give a sec and i 'll dig it up ... edit : here it is : https://vid.me/j4k0, 
  my prediction : swedish gov will probably try to guilt trip finland , norway and denmark into accepting them . 
  but let 's wait and see . 
  what i have learned through this crisis so far is that you never know what crazy stuff will happen next , the only thing that has been certain so far is that next it will get worse . 
  the submission is mere local news . 
  should be removed . 
  * keeps looking at own shoes in silence *, 
  the fun questions in the 30k survey were much better . 
  how are we now supposed to know which country has the hottest women ? 
  also , it would have been interesting to see how much some things have changed over time with the growing numbers of subscribers - such as attitudes towards gay marriage just for one example . 
  wow indeed . 
  i have always been one to defend and speak well of the mods but to me that incident demonstrated what many have been saying : the mod team is lacking both integrity and accountability . 
  the third one was the top thread with 1276 upvotes before the mods removed it . 
  see here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/3prmxb/removed_for_what_reason/, 
  dunno , but i guess it 's an attempt to connect this with breivik who claimed to belong to knights templar . 
   comparing baltimore , even as a destitute city , to a place like aleppo syria is delusional , bordering on the idiotic . 
  good thing no-one made that comparison then . 
  they have lynch mobs in sweden now ? 
  wow , never heard of that . 
  how many have been lynched so far ? 
  i find the subject fascinating as i also do find the history of popular culture in general . 
  additionally , as a ' 70-80s kid i have my own experiences and it 's easy to relate to . 
  have you thought about contributing to / r/askhistorians ? 
  would make interesting reads . 
  thank you for the additional info . 
  white power skinheads a.k.a boneheads are not the same thing as skinheads . 
  racist boneheads may be an offshoot from skinheads but the distinction is there . 
  yup , it definetely does in that photo . 
   the guy looks like a nazi soldier in that picture . 
  some people were talking about him having a star wars costume , but this looks like something completely different . 
  to me that looks like a darth vader mask and helmet , and an eyewitness spoke of an darth vader mask . 
  that would also explain why people wanted to pose in that photo with him . 
  you confusing it to nazi gear in a blurry photo is understandable as the desings of imperial gear and costumes in the star wars took inspiration from the nazi looks and designs . 
  edit : disregard that , i suck cocks . 
  in a much better photo the helmet does look like a stahlhelm . 
   finland has a population of ~ 100 wolves actually the latest estimate is 220-245 wolves which includes about 30 known packs , about 15 pairs , and some loners . 
   romania 2500 yes , i 'm sure there 's more wolves in romania than in finland . 
  yet that does not mean the article 's claim of `` europe 's last remaining virgin forests in romania '' is correct . 
  there are untouched forests with relevant fauna also elsewhere in europe and in the eu - for example in finland . 
  the point being ? 
  we have untouched forests in finland with brown bears and wolves . 
  but i do n't know if they 're still virgins . 
  the news report got updated :  the us marine corps added : `` i can confirm that the pilot ejected , but i do not have additional information at this time . 
  our deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of the pilot . 
  he 's not just standing there . 
  his job is central to the out team and in addition to pitching he 's moving , feigning , purposefully throwing foul pitches at best opportunity etc etc. 
  maybe you could have been a bit clearer from the beginning . 
  simply having a flair signifies what `` here '' may mean . 
  because the planes in question were not stationed in the uk which left the possibility that you were referring to bahrain or miramar . 
  where ? 
  flair up . 
  these six marine corps hornets were travelling from bahrain to their home base in miramar , california . 
  and happened on his way back home . 
   the aircraft was part of fleet of six fighter jets travelling from bahrain to the base in miramar , california , a us air force official said . 
   ... miramar , base of the 3rd marine aircraft wing , said in a statement : `` a third marine aircraft wing fa-18 / c hornet belonging to marine attack fighter squadron 232 stationed at marine corps air station miramar crashed in the vicinity of raf lakenheath at approximately 05:30 am . 
  new york yankees scout troy williams has called finland ` the cuba of europe ' and thinks it 's entirely realistic to see finnish players in mlb in the next 10-15 years . 
  some months ago he visited finland and was quite impressed by the athletic talent of the players . 
  here 's [ a video about his visit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ex31w41fx8 ) . 
  it 's mostly in finnish but his comments in english are timestamped [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ex31w41fx8&amp;t=1m24s ) , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ex31w41fx8&amp;t=3m24s ) and [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ex31w41fx8&amp;t=4m56s )  in one weekend i was able to see five guys throwing 93-97 mph in a country of five million people . 
   ...  i ca n't believe people did n't know about this ... 
  i feel like the guy in the king kong movie finding an 80 foot gorilla !, 
  i ca n't believe that at this day and age it has remained such a secret - just the sheer athleticism of the finnish baseball player . 
   a us marine corps pilot has died in an f-18 jet crash in the fens in cambridgeshire , close to an raf base . 
   ... a witness to the us jet crash , karen miles-holdaway of redmere , said she thought that the pilot did very well to avoid any houses . 
  rip, 
  and ? 
   on a side note , baseball is a big thing in japan . 
  apparently baseball in japan goes way back to 19th century : [ a history of early japanese baseball , the pre-war years ] ( http://www.tofugu.com/2013/03/26/japanese-baseball-history-beginning/ ) and then it grew even bigger after the wwii . 
  but they are not keeping them in sweden . 
  instead thousands have been traveling through sweden ( with free rides by the swedish railways ) to finland and norway . 
  the current rate varies between 100-500 new arrivals daily to finland . 
  so far already 23178 asylym seekers have been registered in finland - by far most of them young men from iraq and somalia - and the asylym system in finland has been overwhelmed . 
  hopefully if sweden finally starts implementing at least some sort of control in their country it will take away some of the pressure . 
  according to the finnish baseball association it 's played in some countries outside finland such as australia , germany and switzerland , but i do n't think it 's in any way well-known in other countries . 
   i need to watch this again when i 'm not sleepy . 
  a pitcher that stands right next to the batter ? 
  [ a graph comparing finnish baseball field and mlb one ] ( http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ar-ak256_finbal_16u_20150709100315.jpg ) . 
  in addition to the zig-zag basepath the finnish field is much larger and there 's a lot more running involved . 
  according to the wsj : * a few years ago , one player wore a pedometer during a game and was found to have run 10.5 kilometers from start to finish . 
  by comparison , soccer superstar cristiano ronaldo averaged 9.6 kilometers covered during champions league matches this year .
