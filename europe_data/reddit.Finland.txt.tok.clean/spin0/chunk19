  also russia has shown its desire to spend more on it than russia could or wanted to . 
  first they tried raising utility rates , canceling major infrastructure projects elsewhere , and [ tapping the pension funds ] ( http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68394 ) . 
  then as that was not enough they [ asked public sector workers to to give up a day 's pay ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/article/503085.html ) for crimea . 
  seems that did n't turn out so well and only then they started looking into the richest citizens if [ they may have money to spare ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/22/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-tax-iduskbn0fr1sb20140722 ) . 
  right , good luck with that - especially after sochi . 
  the other weird putin plan is a crimea [ with blackjack and hookers ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-21/las-vegas-on-the-black-sea-putins-weird-economic-plan-for-crimean-casinos ) . 
   putin is n't going to let it fail . 
  right . 
  just like he did n't let [ the south ossetia he invaded to fail . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/south-ossetia-crimea.html ) he 's a glorious guy like that . 
  no , they 're not random and i never said so . 
  they 're pretty much obvious , logical , deliberate , and the worst they can do without hurting themselves even more . 
  what i was referring to was russia 's randomness as a trading partner in general related to past experiences over many years . 
  many companies including valio certainly have had to learn to deal with it . 
  perhaps ` random ' is not the best word - ` erratic ' . 
  no , is of blatant exaggeration and propaganda !, 
  many wealthy oligarchs can freely travel to almost anywhere . 
  and those oligarchs on the western or russian lists have clearly stated they do n't like traveling anyway . 
  this from 1998 : [ moldova experiences the worth of moscow 's signature on troop withdrawal treaty . 
  ] ( http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=17035&amp;amp;tx_ttnews%5bbackpid%5d=212&amp;amp;no_cache=1#.u-tpj3yf5_0 )  four years elapsed yesterday since russia pledged to withdraw all its troops and arsenals from moldova within three years . 
  russia also committed to withdraw both its weapons and its troops , once again , at osce 1999 summit in istanbul . 
  yep , russia indeed has such travel bans . 
  it started with fsb personnel in 2010 and since then the scope has been widened step by step , and even more so under the last few months . 
  this piece is from may : [ controlling russians through travel bans ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/controlling-russians-through-travel-bans/500914.html )  this year 's crisis in ukraine prompted a dramatic increase in the categories of people included in the travel ban . 
  in april , personnel from the following agencies were almost simultaneously banned from leaving russia to visit any of about 150 countries : the interior ministry ( 1.3 million people ) , defense ministry ( 2 million ) , federal prison service ( 326,000 ) , federal drug control service ( 40,000 ) , employees of the prosecutor general 's office ( 63,000 ) , federal bailiff service employees ( 23,000 ) , federal migration service ( 34,500 ) and emergency situations ministry employees ( 20,000 ) . 
  in all , 4 million government employees are essentially banned from leaving the country , even though the overwhelming majority hold no state secrets and could not jeopardize national security in any way . 
  well , you said ` european agricultural exports ' which may include many other countries not in the eu such as belorussia etc. 
  so your statement may be technically true . 
  but i think it 's primarily the eu exports that are of the interest here ( plus perhaps norway ) . 
   the routes to asia are a cornerstone in their new strategy and 40 % of their revenue is generated by those routes . 
  finnair 's revenue is $ 2.4 bn . 
  i find it dubious to claim that whopping $ 1 bn ( 40 % ) of that is only from those 13 routes to east and south east asia when the company has plenty of other routes and activities . 
  no , the numbers simply do not add up . 
  and while i 'm sure the e and se asia routes make a big part of finnair 's profits from passenger traffic , i certainly do not think the company would go bankrupt in months if some of those routes would become longer . 
   valio alone was exporting 350 million euros worth of milk products to russia every year and now cant export any of them . 
  according to valio their exports to russia will drop from earlier 430 mil to about 100 mil . 
  they also said that while that is indeed a worrysome drop they have had plans for years ready for a situation like this to arise , and can use other markets to compensate for some of those losses . 
  looks like they 're not idiots with all their eggs in one basket , and they indeed have long experience of russia 's randomness as a trading partner . 
   the speculated flight ban could bankrupt finnair in months how the hell would that happen ? 
  while the non-stop routes helsinki-tokyo and helsinki-peking are some of the most profitable of their routes finnair does have also other profitable activities . 
  i do n't think finnair would go bankrupt if they have to take the polar route to tokyo , or the southern route to peking . 
  yes , it will add flight time and rise ticket prices , but ` bankrupt in months ' ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   1/4 of european agricultural exports go to russia . 
  about 1/10 of the eu agricultural exports go to russia . 
  while the eu is the biggest supplier of agricultural products to russia with 42 % share of their imports .

  meanwhile in finland : [ europe 's first diamond mine moving ahead ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/europes_first_diamond_mine_moving_ahead/7173772 ) yep , dozens of diamandiferous kimberlite pipes have been located in finland causing a bit of diamond rush by mining companies . 
  mining operations are at planning stages . 
   which is exactly what russia is aiming for with these sanctions . 
  i do n't think that 's their main point . 
  would be pretty costly way for them to do it because of the accelerated food inflation they 'll get ( [ already at 9.5 % in june ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/food-inflation ) ) . 
  remember that so far they have said to impose embargoes on all those countries that have already imposed sanctions on russia - not just the eu . 
  i think it 's more likely they want to deter more countries from joining the sanctions . 
  some countries may even see it as a new export opportunity instead . 
   in 2013 , agricultural exports ( not sure if this includes the processed goods you linked ) from eu to russia totaled some 120 billion euros ( source ) . 
  uhm ... your source says eu 's * total * agricultural related exports were about 120 bn . 
  that is exports to all other markets . 
  here 's trade with russia ( for details see chapter 7 ) : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/unvcq50 ), 
  and even before this russia 's food inflation has been on increase [ running at 9.5 % in june ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/food-inflation ) . 
  will probably get quite a bit worse .

  thanks , but no thanks . 
   in spite of these advantages and the considerable potential for further development , there are several reasons why the level of re-use is so low , including : here 's one more reason : we have basically endless supply of high quality fresh water over here . 
  we do n't need to re-use waste water , nor do we need directives telling us to do so . 
  now , if there are regions that need re-using then by all means . 
  heh , i just had [ visitors from the netherlands ] ( http://rondreisdoorlapland.nl/ ) up here in north . 
  they left yesterday , so pack up whenever you 're ready ... 
   it 's weird though , we do not have them against you finns . 
  so you 're saying you do n't care about us . 
  :( nah , i just do n't believe it . 
   to me the jokes are all bout love , when we joke about swedes basically it means you 're significant - we think about you . 
  look at the map , remember our looong common history , and think about it from our pov : who would we joke about if not you beloved swedes ? 
  i mean we do have some jokes about russia , but they 're mostly related to the crappy quality of their products and their peculiar political system . 
  gets boring repeating those every two decades . 
  then we had some jokes about estonians after their continent rose from the seas in the early '90s . 
  but now our smart southern bros are doing so well that there 's not much to joke about . 
  but swedes , we 'll always joke about you guys . 
  we 'll always love you . 
  for finland the decisive , game changing battle - albeit not that famous - was the [ defensive victory at ilomantsi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ilomantsi ) july 26 - august 13 , 1944 . 
  in the chain of events in 1944 there were many battles that were decisive in their own right as finland 's future as an independend country was at stake in pretty much all of them . 
  the soviet union had demanded an unconditional surrender and total capitulation of armed forces ( * - demands that finland could not accept and rather continued the fight . 
  for example february 1944 the soviets had launched [ the great bombing raids of helsinki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_helsinki_in_world_war_ii#the_great_raids_of_february_1944 ) with the purpose of forcing finland to capitulate . 
  the three night raids with about 2100 sorties ( about 16500 bombs , 2600 tons ) were mostly fended off with about 670 bombs hitting helsinki ( ~ 4 % ) . 
  that could be called a decisive battle for air defence : had the soviet bombing succeeded helsinki would have been levelled into rubble , thousands or tens of thousands would have died , and who knows perhaps finland might have capitulated . 
  but game changing it was not as the soviet demands for surrender continued ( incidentally at the time they actually believed that they had succeeded at levelling helsinki , wrong ) . 
  june 1944 the soviet union launched a massive strategic offensive which was eventually stopped in the battles of tali -- ihantala , viipurinlahti , \u00c4yr\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4-vuosalmi , tienhaara and nietj\u00e4rvi . 
  again they could all be called decisive battles as failing to stop the soviet offensive would have led to capitulation and surrender on soviet terms . 
  but game changing they were not as the soviet demands remained the same as before . 
  at the end of july 1944 soviet union started their last major offensive . 
  two soviet divisions ( 176th and 289th ) attacked towards the strategically important road crossing in [ ilomantsi ] ( http://mekri.uef.fi/sotahistoria/index.htm ) . 
  their goal was to take the roads , to advance behind the finnish forces that had halted the soviet strategic offensive , and to continue the strategic offensive into finland . 
  the ensuing battle of ilomantsi lasted until august 13 . 
  the two soviet divisions were enveloped , encircled , decimated and routed leaving behind their heavy armament and ordnance . 
  that defensive victory in ilomantsi was a decisive battle because had it been lost the whole front would have collapsed . 
  it was also a game changing battle because only after that defensive victory did the soviet union drop their earlier demands of unconditional surrender leading to peace negotiations and armstice in september .
