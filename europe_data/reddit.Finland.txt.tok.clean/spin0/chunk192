   but he was a racist who hated turks & arabs according to some reports he hated those who bullied him . 
  no , not german scalps . 
  see ? 
  that is exactly why you should not let things spiral out of control . 
  the article is scant of details , and i 'm not sure what actually happened , but usually it is the duty of the police to enforce the law . 
   `` criminalizing solidarity projects is a method that has nothing to do with the principles and values of the left , '' the party said in a statement . 
  it is not the police 's fault if something is not legal . 
  they should be enforcing the law . 
  is n't syriza in the goverment ? 
  then making laws is their responsibility , not the police 's . 
  all the more reason to maintain control . 
  you can not deliver those in an anarchy , can you ? 
  how would you control the origin of the scalps then ? 
  no i 'm sure we could deliver in a controlled fashion . 
  and would call for an equally awesome gesture in return . 
  but what would that be ? 
  resident norwegians , any ideas ? 
  what would you ask from santa ? 
   alexander ritzmann is senior advisor to the european foundation for democracy in brussels . 
  he chairs the communication and narratives working group at the european commission 's radicalisation awareness network and teaches on terrorism at potsdam university . 
  ritzmann was a member of the berlin state parliament , overseeing the state police and intelligence agency . 
  `` terror expert '' . 
  lol, 
  no he is not . 
  claiming that the crises we have seen since 2007 are not actually crises is denying the reality to the point of being delusional . 
   brexit was not supposed to happen and nobody expected it to happen , even the politicians who pushed for it . 
  so now it has thrown uk and eu into a huge period of uncertainty . 
  as opposed to the previous crises ? 
  apparently they were all supposed to happen ? 
  hmm ? 
  according to the senior inspector tuomas portaankorva the threat assessment from last november is still valid :  `` threat assessment is that the possibility of acts of individual violence has increased in finland . 
  finland is not a named target of any terrorist organization . 
  a wider strike organized by a terrorist organization is not likely but individual acts of violence are possible in finland . '',

   the only real crisis on the list . 
  k * walks back slowly *, 
  financial crisis , debt crises , $ crisis , ukraine , migrant crisis , brexit etc. . . 
  i would n't call any of them `` just normal problems '' instead of crisis , they are called crises for a good reason not because of `` media hysteria '' . 
  it 's just a simple cap . 
  the shape is a traditional finnish headgear which is nowadays most notably used by finnish scouts .

  yup . 
  the eu has been run in a crisis mode for almost a decade now : crisis after crisis after crisis with no end in sight . 
  to start fixing any of that the eu needs to first implement the things agreed years ago . 
  reported by bayerischer rundfunk : http://www.br.de/nachrichten/salafisten-deradikalisierung-grenzen-100.html i do n't know where you got your ideas about urls but they do n't have any bearing on the\u00efr reporting . 
  yup , they said so . 
  and i say the aliens did it . 
  that is just as much a fact . 
  now there 's disagreeing voices even from the leftist party linke : * merkel 's refugee policy was ` reckless ' : left party leader *  the attacks carried out by refugees in germany over the past week show that merkel 's welcoming policy towards refugees was `` reckless '' , the left party 's ( die linke ) co-leader said on monday . 
   ...  `` although we must wait for a concrete explanation of the background of the attack in ansbach , we can say this much : the events of the past few days show that the acceptance and integration of a large number of refugees and migrants is tied up with significant problems and is more difficult than merkel tried to persuade us last autumn with her reckless ` wir schaffen es ' [ we can do it ] , '' the left-wing politician declared in a statement . 
   ...  `` the state must now do everything to ensure that people in our country can feel safe again . 
  that requires us knowing who is in the country and , as far as possible , where there is potential for danger . 
  i think mrs merkel and the government now have a particular responsibility to retain the trust of the people in the capability of the state and its security authorities , '', 
   but let 's put things in prospective : we are living in the lost peaceful time of human history . 
  do you appreciate that ? 
  and if you do then why import people with proto-fascist iron age ideology willing to kill you ? 
  great times . 
  let 's have that again !, 
   i 'm pretty sure violence is at an all time low in europe and the world in general . 
  great , let 's import more of it then !, 
  also known for their rare ability of pussy per finger . 
  no , we will not take it we will rise above it . 
   which is supported by facts . 
  the article you linked has little facts to support that . 
  looks more like a collection of interpretations of someone else 's interpretations . 
  and kerry while defending the mass-detainments . 
   intelligence agencies and private internet security companies are pretty sure its russia . 
  looks pretty flimsy if we 're to go by that article of condensed stupidity . 
  edit : i mean , just take a critical look at the article and its sources . 
  it 's a collection of flim-flam whishy-washy spin of vague speculations with no hard evidence for support . 
  and on top of that you have contractors presented as the `` experts '' . 
  obviously it 's evolution pressure caused by peculiar geography : when water level rises the tallest survive , which leads to sexual selection pressure of females preferring the tallest mates who are more likely to survive . 
  like in the case clinton 's personal server there 's little reason to believe it was hacked by just one single operator . 
  the solution is to make new products of all that milk . 
  someone just needs to figure out the processes . 
  with $ 500 million we could even turn it into booze !, 
  and then deliver every eu citizen a daily pint . 
  \\ o / or a * biofuel * . 
  we could all be driving around in a mercedes filled up by french cows . 
  and if we further develop milk into a rocket fuel the synergies with the airbus and the cnes are obvious . 
  more milk for science !, 
  how about novel explosives ? 
  military applications are the best applications , and all it needs is someone to figure out how to make milk detonate and we have a kickass eu military with endless supply . 
  you honestly believe that 's the `` it '' that has been going on ? 
  the last i read there has been thousands upon thousands of wanton arrests so far . 
   why the fuck should russia even want to attack europe ? 
  really , wtf ? 
  they have been allies of uk and france in both world wars . 
  well , in both world wars russia did attack . 
  in the wwi russia mobilised against the german empire on july 30th , and in the wwii the soviet union invaded poland together with nazi germany as they had previously agreed . 
   but because finland was part of the zarist russia for only about 100 years finland was an autonomous grand duchy in the russian empire ( not a part of russia ) . 
  before that finland was a part of sweden for over 600 years . 
  stalin did not invade finland because they had had some joyous history together . 
  according to the agreement between the nazi germany and the soviet union on how to split the spoils of war in europe finland belonged to the soviets . 
   the eu could easily create a military that could fend of any russian aggression better start right away then , and provided all goes well in twenty years the eu might have a professional military to `` fend of any russian aggression '' . 
  armies , navies , air-forces - especially modern ones with numerous specialist skills - are not something you simply wish into existence at will when the need arises . 
  have n't been like that for centuries and even less today . 
  while mere `` mass-scale '' is kinda underwhelming performance fortunately john kerry 's spokesman says it should be * reasonable to anybody * for erdogan to extend it as wide as he feels . 
   `` i 'm not justifying every decision that they 're making and i 'm not defending it , but i think it should be reasonable to anybody to understand that they would have to investigate and to look as widely as they feel they need to to try to get better information ... about who was responsible '' . 
  `` as widely as they feel they need '' .
