  now they 're cooking with gas . 
   rather , it was the absurdly low bar for exit , requiring only a simple majority . 
  given voter turnout of 70 % , this meant that the leave campaign won with only 36 % of eligible voters backing it . 
  well , if you call that a failure of democracy then fathom this : in many countries it routinely takes the votes of only a tiny fraction of a permille of population to pass legistation that affects the rest of population . 
  thye forgot the option ` rope ' . 
  or is that included in the ` other ' ? 
   every issue under the sun could be solved if we had these , it 's like asking for fairy dust . 
  basically globalization would work brilliantly if someone would just hurry up with magical ingredients . 
  indeed . 
  one magical ingredient got first introduced decades ago : the idea of ` trickle-down economics ' in which the pixie dust should fall down on everyone from the profit-reaping elites . 
  and after waiting for decades for the magical pixie dust to fall it is no wonder if people are getting doubtful about its existence . 
   trade and cooperation between sovereign nation states is the only tried and tested method we have so far . 
  we did try globalisation before . 
  that period is called the * belle epoque * . 
  it ended into a disaster . 
  in those times the economies were even more interconnected than today . 
  it was a period of ever-growing profits which were mostly reaped by the elite . 
  globalisation , free trade & investment , global economic integration and mass migration provided huge profits like never seen before . 
  energy was cheap , raw materials were cheap , and labour was cheap and was kept so with class structures , social and economic inequality , and with mass immigration which kept wages dirt low ( try striking when you can get replaced by an imported worker eager to take over your job ) . 
  that sweet period of huge profits ended with the disaster of the wwi , and the related social , political and economic upheavals that followed . 
  many of the post-globalisation upheavals were beneficial and some long warranted societal changes did take place . 
  yet not all of that upheaval was good and thanks to the ills of globalisation we also got extremists such as communist revolutionaries and then fascists as a reaction . 
  i do see parallels between the belle epoque and what we 're currently doing . 
  those times they had empires , in a way so do we and we are even eager to grow them even if we do n't choose to call them empires . 
  they were dependend on open sea lanes and the related sea power to keep it that way , and so are we . 
  they were interdependent and mistakenly believed economic integration would guarantee peace , and so do we . 
  they made huge profits which were mostly reaped by the elite , just like today . 
  they believed the future is going to be one big ever growing profit-fest of ever increasing globalisation , and so do we . 
  they imported workforce pushing down wages , and it 's happening again . 
  they imposed controls on the media , and so we see today albeit one huge difference is that in those days there was n't as big media to echo their message as today . 
  i 'm not one of those who believes that history magically repeats itself , but in contemporary trends i do n't see much preventing that either . 
  and despite what proponents may claim globalisation is not a guarantee for world peace , was n't before and there 's little reason to believe it should be now . 
  additionally globalisation is not at all irreversible . 
  it changed in the past and might just as well change in future . 
   we ca n't take a top-down , theoretical solution from a text book and force it to work - not if we want to retain democracy at the same time . 
  indeed . 
  and that too has been tried before with spectacular failures . 
  and in fact soviets went as far as recognising that it required a whole new breed of people , [ the new soviet man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_soviet_man ) , for their theory to work . 
  and , i might add , it is hardly a co-incidence the term ` political correctness ' , that people should be allowed to only express acceptable opinions , originates from the failed effort of creating a new man fit for the new order . 
  which is perhaps another parallel to what people are living through today . 
   equally , aspirants to power , such as donald trump in the us and marine le pen in france , offer clear , simple and wrong solutions -- notably , nationalism , nativism and protectionism . 
  and those are wrong because ? 
  nothing makes any of those ideas intrinsically wrong . 
  the article starts with that claim but does not substantiate . 
  apparently the claim is to be taken simply as the truth as assumed . 
  also , a solution being clear and simple is a merit , not a flaw . 
  in a solution convolution and complexity are inferior to clarity and simplicity . 
   the remedies they offer are bogus . 
  you already said they 're wrong but you still have n't explained why ? 
   but the illnesses are real . 
  they indeed are . 
  i 'm glad an esteemed paper as the ft has taken notice of that reality . 
   if governing elites continue to fail to offer convincing cures , they might soon be swept away and , with them , the effort to marry democratic self-government with an open and co-operative world order . 
  look , no-one actually has asked for this `` world order '' . 
  that looks like a demarcation line between the elites and the people suffering the consequences : it may very well be the elites have been longing for this world order , and they simply forgot there are also other people . 
   real income stagnation over a far longer period than any since the second world war is a fundamental political fact . 
  not only political , it 's an economic fact . 
  and that is certainly not what the elite with their ideas of new world order promised people . 
  no , they promised prosperity brought by their ` world order ' . 
  yet somehow the profits got mostly reaped by the elite . 
  no wonder if after three decades people are growing more and more skeptical about the benefits of this new ` world order ' which is not even democratic . 
  no , we do n't get to vote who runs the imf nor how , and there are no wto elections . 
  yet somehow these organisations rule the world economy in this new ` world order ' , and they 're run by the profit-reaping elite that lied to people in the first place . 
   citizenship of their nations is the most valuable asset owned by most people in wealthy countries . 
  they will resent sharing this with outsiders . 
  you do know you 've been shafted clean when the most valuable asset you own is your citizenship . 
  if that 's all you 've left then you 've lost everything else for the new ` world order ' . 
   first , understand that we depend on one another for our prosperity . 
  used to be that way but no we do n't any more . 
  if a super-market cashier wants to remind the employee that ` we depend on one another for our prosperity ' she quickly gets replaced by a cheaper immigrant who has no qualms about the low wage and working conditions . 
  obviously we do n't depend on one another for our prosperity any more - it 's the elite that has become dependend on imported workforce , and as far as they care the rest can just as well go fuck themselves . 
  two-three decades ago that was not possible . 
  the workforce looked after their interests and went to strike if they had to , that was how the ` we depend on one another for our prosperity ' worked . 
  now a worker gets easily replaced or a company relocated . 
  the equation is broken , there 's no interdependecy and the prosperity part has become onesided . 
   it is essential to balance ** assertions of sovereignty ** with the requirements of global co-operation . 
  ** global governance ** , while essential , must be oriented towards doing things countries can not do for themselves . 
  `` assertions of sovereignty '' ? 
  sovereignty is not an `` assertion '' . 
  sovereignty , independence and self-government are basic principles in international law since west-fucking-phalia . 
  `` global governance '' ? 
  what in the actual fuck ? 
  now i do n't know if the writer is an old-skool-communist extremist , or a bond-villain , with dreams of ruling ... ahem governing the world . 
  no-one has mandate for global governance and no-one has voted for a world government for global governance . 
  and if a world government comes to tell me how to live the least i would do is to tell them fuck right off before i fucking shoot them bastards . 
  and no , it is not me who is insane . 
  it 's the guy writing about `` assertions of sovereignty '' and `` global governance '' that is mad as hatter . 
  good . 
  we should also ban french kissing unless it is performed by authentic frenchmen , and as controlling for that would be racist and short step away from a new 3rd reich in name of liberty we should ban such practices in every member country . 
   muslim religion desperately needs reformation like christians did back in the 16th c. impossible . 
  that idea is often rooted in an incorrect view of history as a power of envitable progress which it is certainly not . 
  history is not a direction towards something . 
  it 's just a series of random , albeit interconnected , stuff that happened . 
  there never was a direction in it . 
  there never will be . 
  it will always remain that way . 
  and history does not repeat itself in cycles . 
  what happened with christianity centuries ago certainly does not apply to every religion on earth and even less to islam . 
  there will never be a ` lutheran reform ' of islam . 
  because that is not what islam is about .
