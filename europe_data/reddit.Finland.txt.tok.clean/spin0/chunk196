  because we should think very long term far past an election cycle . 
  perhaps there 's something to learn from the us in that regard ? 
  thanks , i 'll check it out . 
   i might consider buying from them and not a clone from some other company . 
  why not simply make your own m\u00f6lkky set ? 
  it 's super easy . 
  i 've heard peter the great was an avid gorodki player . 
  is that true ? 
  gorodki is more similar to [ kyykk\u00e4 ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyykk%c3%a4 ) which is one of the three games played in the gorodki world championships . 
  thank you for this post !, 
  what an interesting and refreshing speech . 
  made me google more about it . 
  what actually is the experteese of the `` academics '' signing the letter ? 
  experts of what ? 
  i think that may be a bit tall order for a documentary , just think about the enormous scale . 
  europe has a long complex history and a documentary series telling it all from prehistory to modern times could easily become tens or hundreds of hours long . 
  film makers have to cut corners and omit things to keep it at bearable length and cost . 
  therefore documentaries tend to concentrate on only some specific themes , periods or phenomena . 
  also , any documentary talking about the history of the western civilisation will talk about the history of europe . 
  keeping those in mind , here 's my recommendations . 
  for kids and why not adults too : ** [ once upon a time ... man ( 1978 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/once_upon_a_time..._man ) ** animated series telling the history of mankind including the western civilisation and europe . 
  [ check them opening credits that gave the chills for us '70s kids . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnla4b-pbg ) ** [ civilisation : a personal view by kenneth clark ( 1969 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilisation_%28tv_series%29 ) ** a 13 episode cultural history of the western civilisation from the dark ages to 20th century . 
  despite its age still among the best history documentary series ever . 
  a landmark of 11 hours running time . 
  ** [ andrew marr 's history of the world ( 2012 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrew_marr's_history_of_the_world ) ** a pretty good documentary series with great production value but short and with limited scope . 
  it 's only 8 episodes with some of them talking about the history of europe with a lot omitted because brevity . 
  podcasts and audio books tend to be much more informative than tv documentaries with their limited budgets , limited running times and limited scopes . 
  here 's my recommendations : the great courses : [ ** foundations of western civilization ** , prof. thomas f. x. noble , ph.d. ( 2002 ) ] ( http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/foundations-of-western-civilization.html ) 48 lectures , 24 hours telling the history of the western civilisation and europe from the beginning of history to the renaissance . 
  a very good series of lectures ( albeit i did n't listen through every single one ) . 
  pricey , but there 's also the free trial option . 
  the great courses : [ ** foundations of western civilization ii : a history of the modern western world ** , prof. robert bucholz , d.phil . 
  ( 2006 ) ] ( http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/foundations-of-western-civilization-ii-a-history-of-the-modern-western-world.html ) 48 lectures , 24 hours covering over 600 years of the history of the western civilisation and europe from the renaissance to modern days . 
  again a very good series of lectures , with the free trial option . 
  relevant spiegel article from yesterday : [ brexit aftershocks : an inside look at the eu 's raging power struggle ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/brexit-triggers-eu-power-struggle-between-merkel-and-juncker-a-1100852.html ), 
  [ sulphur hexafluoride ftw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7xdoyzikko&amp;t=3m6s ), 
  see : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_anx_en.pdf  qa17.1-3 for each of the following statements about the eu could you please tell me whether you think it is true or false . 
   the eu currently consists of 28 member states  the members of the european parliament are directly elected by the citizens of each member state  switzerland is a member state of the eu, 
   but then could n't i call uk 's government in northern ireland `` a puppet government and occupies an eu member state to this day '' ? 
  not really . 
  northern ireland as a part of the uk has international recognition . 
  but northern cyprus is recognised only by turkey and even the un has declared its independence legally invalid . 
  firstly , contrary to some popular beliefs having border disputes does not prevent a country from applying for eu membership or becoming a member . 
  number of countries with border disputes have become members ( such as estonia , latvia , slovenia , croatia ) and that 's okay as those disputes get resolved peacefully ( a ` good neighbour ' criterion ) . 
  the case of cyprus is a bit different as it is not a mere border dispute . 
   also why was cyprus allowed into the eu without the partition being resolved ? 
  you can find the best answer to that question by reading the [ copenhagen european council 12 and 13 december 2002 conclusions . 
  ] ( https://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/73842.pdf ) quote :  10 . in accordance with paragraph 3 above , as the accession negotiations have been completed with cyprus , cyprus will be admitted as a new member state to the european union . 
  nevertheless , the european council confirms its strong preference for accession to the european union by a united cyprus . 
  in this context it welcomes the commitment of the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots to continue to negotiate with the objective of concluding a comprehensive settlement of the cyprus problem by 28 february 2003 on the basis of the unsg 's proposals . 
  the european council believes that those proposals offer a unique opportunity to reach a settlement in the coming weeks and urges the leaders of the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot communities to seize this opportunity . 
   11 . the union recalls its willingness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in the treaty of accession in line with the principles on which the eu is founded . 
  in case of a settlement , the council , acting by unanimity on the basis of proposals by the commission , shall decide upon adaptations of the terms concerning the accession of cyprus to the eu with regard to the turkish cypriot community . 
   12 . the european council has decided that , in the absence of a settlement , the application of the acquis to the northern part of the island shall be suspended , until the council decides unanimously otherwise , on the basis of a proposal by the commission . 
  meanwhile , the council invites the commission , in consultation with the government of cyprus , to consider ways of promoting economic development of the northern part of cyprus and bringing it closer to the union . 
   a nuclear bomb is n't exactly your go to weapon for accuracy . 
  but the delivery vehicle does need accuracy . 
  the probability of a nuclear weapon destroying its target , known as * lethality * k , depends on two factors : yield ( y , the energy released by the warhed ) and cep ( c , a radius within which the warhead has 50 % chance of landing ) . 
  k = y ^ 2/3 / c ^ 2 in past ballistic missiles were very inaccurate and they had ceps in range of kilometers . 
  for example , titan i had a cep of about 1.8 km and the soviet ss-7 saddler 2.7 km . 
  what they lacked in accuracy they had to compensate with high yield of the warhead which was several megatons ( 3-6 mt for ss-7 ) . 
  but as you can see from the equation boosting the yield is an inefficient method to get higher lethality . 
  if you multiply the yield by eight ( e.g. 
  from 1mt to 8 mt ) the lethality gets multiplied by four . 
  but if you reduce the cep with a factor of eight the lethality is boosted by factor of 64 . 
  hence accuracy has been a priority in ballistic missile development . 
  and over time the targeting technologies have become more accurate and ballistic missiles do n't need megaton warheads in order to destroy their targets . 
   your culture is closer related to the sami people of norrland in sweden , or hungarians and the baltic countries . 
  man , i love the armchair cultural anthropologists . 
  pure , uncontained laughter . 
  that is true . 
  such poll might very much change in the future when the initial doom and gloom sentiment has passed , and people have made the observation that in fact the uk did not sink into the atlantic . 
   problem is , globalization is more akin to a force of nature than something you can vote on . 
  i do n't think it is a force of nature at all . 
  it is a set of policies actively driving it . 
  there is no other reason for those policies , and by extent globalization , to exist than what has been politically decided . 
  and that is or at least should be something people should be able to vote on . 
   what can be done is to take steps to lessen its negative effects , particularly income inequality . 
  maybe . 
  unfortunately that 's not what globalization is about . 
  the negative effects are inbuilt into it . 
  of course it might be possible to lessen those negative effects , but unfortunately it seems not enough has been nor will be done in that regard . 
  i mean , even some leftists are oblivious to how open borders are at odds with the domestic losers of globalization not only in terms of emploment but also wages and social nets , and instead of taking their real grievances seriously some even choose to merely mock them or call them names . 
  we have already had globalization before over a century ago . 
  it led to a disaster and to rise of extremist ideologies and policies ( first communism , then fascism ) . 
  globalization is not a force of nature . 
  it is a set of policies , and just as those have changed in the past they can change in the future . 
  the previous period of globalization and free trade was in late 19th and early 20th century . 
  then trade openness of national economies and gross capital flows were actually even higher than today . 
  the period 1871-1914 is often called the * belle epoque * . 
  raw materials and energy ( coal ) were cheap , and very cheap labour was ensured by class structures , inequality , and mass immigration . 
  that period ended into a total disaster ( wwi ) and the aftermath led to an opposite trend with increasing protectionism and related social , political and economic upheavals . 
  in the sense of economic integration the globalization we have seen in the past 30 years pales in comparison to that of the belle epoque , and today 's world economy is less integrated than it was then :  contrary to popular belief the most impressive episode of international economic integration which the world has seen to date was not the second half of the 20th century , but the years between 1870 and the great war . 
  the 19th century , and in particular the late 19th century , was the period that saw the largest decline ever in inter-continental barriers to trade and factor mobility . 
  ( o\u2019rourke , k. h. ( 2000 ) europe and the causes of globalization , 1790 to 2000 in h.kierzkowski ( ed . 
  ) , from europeanization of the globe to the globalization of europe ( palgrave , 2002 ) ) there 's many lessons to learn from the belle epoque . 
  the first one is that contrary to what many may claim economic integration is certainly not a guarantee for peace . 
  the second one is that globalization tends to promote inequality and the benefits tend to mostly get reaped by the elite . 
  the third lesson is that contemporary trends of globalization are not at all irreversible . 
  they have changed in the past and may just as well change in the future .
