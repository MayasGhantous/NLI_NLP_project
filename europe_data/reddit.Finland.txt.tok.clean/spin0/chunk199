  now more than ever it is a time for self-reflection for the eu . 
  not an excuse with this voter turnout : https://twitter.com/skydata/status/746700869656256512  % who got through our final #euref poll turnout filter by age group : 18-24 : 36 % 25-34 : 58 % 35-44 : 72 % 45-54 : 75 % 55-64 : 81 % 65 + : 83 % the young really failed themselves , and with such an abysmal turnout have little reason to express any animosity towards older people . 
  probably should have listened to their parents and gone out to vote . 
  too late to cry about it now .

  will you eat a sock if it turns out there 's no recession after all for the uk because of this ? 
  here 's an opinion poll after the referendum result : https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/746808977908994048  on the eu referendum result : happy : 48 % unhappy : 43 % indifferent : 7 % ( via comres ) does not seem to support the narrative of leave voters regretting . 
  to the contrary . 
  his * ada nella jungla * was published in finnish like decades ago , and that 's how i first learned about him . 
  '' '' '' `` an umbrella '' '' '' '', 
   we 're seeing numerous reports of people voting leave as a protest vote , based on the assumption that remain would win are we really ? 
  what i have seen so far is some big headlines in the media with nothing to back them up but some cherrypicked social media posts of unclear provenance . 
  and even if those social media posts were true and honest they 'd form only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of a promille of voters . 
  i mean , 17\u00a0410\u00a0742 voters said leave and i can not see how a handful of cherrypicked posts in the social media would capture their general mood or rationale for their vote . 
  there 's also very likely many more posts in the social media saying something completely different but not making into headlines . 
  yet for some reason it is the far and few ` regret ' posts of unclear provenace that have suddenly gained the attention of media . 
  i wonder why that is ? 
  why are these ` reports ' cherrypicking things to * that * extent unless they 're desperate to form a narrative ? 
   they do not . 
  the politicians in charge are well aware of these issues , despite what the tabloids may say . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  had they been well aware of the issues they would n't now be pants-down surprised by the brexit vote result . 
   but what would finland do with low-educated workers if it were n't inside the eu ? 
  they would still have to work for ever decreasing wages , wouldnt they ? 
  that race to the bottom is nothing the eu invented . 
  one of my friends was a construction worker . 
  he was skilled , experienced and hardworking . 
  and he used to get decent wages for his work , was living reasonably well , had a car , lived in an apartment on rent and afforded to save money for buying/building his own house one day . 
  basically his life was about working hard , earning money and making long term plans for his future family . 
  that all changed when immigrant workers from the new eu member states entered the construction jobs market . 
  migrant workers are often not only willing but aiming to live from paycheck to paycheck in a self-imposed state of austerity , as they see that as a temporary situation in their lives . 
  they 're willing to work for far smaller wages than someone whose long term plans are to save for own house to raise a family in finland . 
  as a result my friend 's wages got smaller and smaller until all he got for his work was the absolute minimum wage . 
  in the end it did n't matter how skilled , experienced and hardworking he was . 
  his lifestyle changed completely and was characterized by short periods of minimum wage construction jobs with periods of unemployment in between - with unemployment allowance paid by finnish taxpayers . 
  he lost his savings , he lost his apartment because he could not afford the rent and got a cheap apartment subsidized by finnish taxpayers . 
  and with long periods of unemployment it got harder and harder for him to get a job at all . 
  eventually he applied and got an early retirement - again paid by the finnish taxpayers . 
  he never wanted any of that , he never wanted to live on the finnish taxpayers . 
  to the contrary he used to have long term plans saving money he used to earn for achieving those . 
  try telling him how it was not the eu that caused it . 
  because it was the direct result of the eu . 
  and when he says that the eu does not give a single fuck about the lives of ordinary people , and is more likely to ruin them , his own life is all the evidence he needs . 
  and if there was a ` fixit ' referendum in finland i know how he would vote . 
   that race to the bottom is nothing the eu invented . 
  well , for some it has been . 
  and , while i do n't believe you 're a politician promoting the eu , what you just said is not a good way to promote the eu because : 1 ) it is incorrect for those who actually have experienced the race to the bottom as a direct result of the eu 2 ) it trivializes and even denies their very real life experiences 3 ) all it does is create further animosity towards the eu as it only emphasizes the disconnect between ordinary people and the eu elite, 
  that article does not have the actual voter turnout demographics by age . 
  from earlier polls we already know that roughly 75 % of 18-24 year olds supported remain and about 25 % leave . 
  but that does not tell us how many actually voted i.e. 
  the turnout . 
  in fact the article misinterprets the polls and claims nonsensically :  according to polling data from yougov , 75 % of 18 - to 24-year-olds voted to remain in the european union . 
  which is nonsense as that would mean about 100 % of 18-24 year olds voted ( 75 % remain + 25 % leave ) . 
  what is needed is the breakdowns of the voter * turnout * by age groups . 
  i have n't seen any published yet but patience , they will come sooner or later . 
  `` i just do n't understand it . 
  throughout the entire campaign i called at least 120,000 people racist , and yet we still lost '', 
  the times has taken their paywall down and all their articles are free access until midnight . 
  democracy has been hijacked by people who actually go out and vote !, 
  indeed . 
  generally young voters are the least likely to vote . 
  and it does not matter what you claim to support in * opinion polls * if you do n't actually go out and cast your vote . 
  according to the bbc that was one of the reasons why remain lost : [ eight reasons leave won the uk 's referendum on the eu ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36574526 ), 
  generally young voters are also the least likely to vote . 
  and it does not matter what you claim to support in opinion polls if you do n't actually go out and cast your vote . 
  i do n't know the age breakdowns for the brexit referendum but here 's related numbers from the 2015 election :  it is a matter of fact that the older you are , the more likely you are to make the effort to vote - 78 % of those 65 or over voted in the 2015 election , compared with 43 % of 18-24 year olds and 54 % of 25-34 year olds . 
  bbc : [ eight reasons leave won the uk 's referendum on the eu ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36574526 ), 
  well done . 
  first time i heard about that sob . 
  may kek bless you sir . 
  happy 17 . mai , bros !, 
  terrorist bombs often do have lots of metal in them as their purpose is to kill and maime and their bombs are filled with metal shrapnel . 
  you can see the amount of shrapnel in this second bomb defused today in st.petersburg metro : http://i.imgur.com/4kznxdz.png, 
  and now i do n't know what you have been watching could you elaborate ? 
   there is no argument to be had  you are being highly naive okay, 
  great . 
  attack the person , not the argument . 
  it 's right at the beginning .

  and something something the fourth secretary-general of the united nations from 1972 to 1981 and the ninth president of austria from 1986 to 1992 had nazi links was not the end of the world iirc,
