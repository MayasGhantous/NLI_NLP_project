  and yes , as we all know their reporting is bullshit . 
   on channel one there was explicitly said that osce is not observing the elctions . 
  interesting . 
  so , what this particular channel was reporting about the osce yesterday ? 
  and what are they reporting about the newly fangled fake organisation ? 
  but the positive news is that unlike the fake referendum in crimea with options limited only to annexation , annexation , annexation or annexation this time the russian fake election tradition has progressed with the options in the ballots . 
  now there 's two . 
  the pro-russia party option and the pro-russia party option . 
  but apparently someone has defaced a sacred ballot of the will of the people with [ a provocative message ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ovcqz2f.jpg ) * `` glory to ukraine . 
  glory to heroes . 
  shame on dpr . 
  ukrainian army is coming for you . 
  yep , it 's suo-mi . 
  the domain . su \u00efs the soviet union . 
  not sure if we mere finns can ever capture that alone by ourselves , nor if we even want it . 
  and the domain . sm is probably something else but honestly does not sound any better than the . su one . 
  i 'd say . fi will do for us finns . 
  at least until we 're ready to take the soviet union . 
  also , the russian propaganda media such as rt has been blatantly lying about osce observers : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b1dfi3bcaaalzpv.jpg since yesterday russian propaganda media including the rt have been claiming that there 's osce present observing the election . 
  [ the osce has repeatedly denied this ] ( https://twitter.com/osce_smm/status/528625628237811713 ) saying it has not sent observers to the `` so-called `` elections '' in east ukraine '' . 
  the election is against ukrainian law , breaks the minsk agreement , and has been deemed illegitimate by the un , the eu , the us ect . 
  the only country claiming to recognise the illegitimate election has been russia - against their signing of the minsk agreement . 
  so , yesterday the rebels and their accomplices invented a sham organisation out of thin air just to confuse people , the asce or the `` agency for security and cooperation in europe '' , under which to pretend to observe the illegitimate election : [ sham observer org for ukrainian separatist strongholds invented day before election ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/sham-observer-org-for-ukrainian-separatist-strongholds-invented-day-before-election/article21418834/ ) and if rt had even the tiniest shred of journalistic integrity in them they would be reporting of the sham organisation instead of still claiming it 's the osce . 
  also impressed by the care taken to confirm the voting person 's id and to see if actually entitled to vote . 
  and ? 
  show me when the test was to scheduled to launch a model ( mbr ) rt-2pm2 topol-m which has n't been tested since year 2000 at the very date of illegitimate election that russia supports . 
  the soviet union has a domain name ? 
  you did n't know ? 
  hell , even some of the russian propaganda channels have started to revive that as their top domain , and in fact also the self-proclaimed `` people 's republics '' in eastern ukraine use the . su domain . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  shiiit , and here i was thinking you were promoting it to finns only in yest knowing what a totally fucked up domain name that is . 
  i think we already made it quite clear in wwii that we wo n't adopt the . su, 
  i do n't even know why you 're asking . 
  icbm launches are not news in sweden ? 
  edit : apparently not . 
  was the first time to launch model ( mbr ) rt-2pm2 topol-m since year 2000 . 
  read it as you like : sudden last launch of an aged missile type , or a test for an upgrade . 
  and if you 're not seeing anything worth of note in the launch , you 're probably not the person to discuss such issues with . 
  note to self : as per requests more patriotism needed , for now on . su only - do n't even know what a . sm is but does n't look like something to find out . 
   as a great nationalist philosopher once said , `` it 's better to wear the helmet of a red army soldier than to live on a diet of hamburgers in brooklyn '' . 
  which is a pretty stupid thing to say . 
  probably the great philosopher you like is not that great after all . 
  yep , considering how much emphasis the anti-fascist and anti-far-right rhetorics get in the russian propaganda it 's funny to note that even their chosen talking heads , never mind russia 's policies , are actually far-right and even to the extreme . 
  there 's also this german apologist of kremlin with fake credencials : [ the mysterious professor haag : russian media 's favored ` expert ' has dubious credentials ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-media-professor-haag-dubious-credentials/26632541.html ), 
   and envies long queues of people eager to vote did he mention the [ food for vote program ] ( http://en.censor.net.ua/photo_news/309902/russian_terrorists_entice_electorate_into_polling_stations_with_cheap_potatoes_photos ) ? 
  and now as a newly invented ` asce ' member how does he feel of his newly fangled fake organization ? 
  so i take it you just like russian invasions . 
   the issue of the incompetence of osce yes , i very much agree this is a very legitimate issue regarding the conflict in ukraine . 
  perhaps a bit outside of the topic of the illegitimate election but a valid concern nevertheless . 
  edit : to me the problem with your snide remark is the way you choose to willfully misrepresent your source in a way which is very much misleading . 
   the extreme left-wingers are mainly greek ( if not exclusively ) , greece and russia has old religious ties through orthodox christianity . 
  til the communist party of greece is orthodox christian . 
   this is not the first time i see this kind of criticis yes , it is certainly not the first time . 
  i 'm not happy with the limited osce coverage either . 
  first they were kidnapped , and then they were given only about 400 m of border in two spots to actually observe . 
  and i have been reading their reports daily and they have been very limited even after the minsk agreement . 
  but as i said let 's not confuse issues here . 
  if you truly believe fake observers with fake credencials are `` doing better job '' at observing illegitimate election , as you said , then i do n't know what more i can say . 
   in 2014 , he was involved in a scandal for being drunk while visiting crimea . 
  well , that 's a gracious way to put it . 
  according to media reports he was in crimea to observe the illegitimate referendum but was too drunk to find a polling station to actually observe . 
  and apparently the guy georgios lambroulis is also a member of parliament in greece ( !? ) . 
  that communist person is now in the good company of extreme right wing nationalists obeying the [ horseshoe theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) . 
  while i 'm sure fake observers are better at monitoring fake election , the ukrainian serviceman is not talking about observing illegitimate election at all . 
  what he is disappointed with the osce is the apparent inability of the legitimate osce observers to actually go out to observe and to note the numerous breaches of the cease fire by the rebels . 
  and i do think he has a legitimate point in his critisism as after the rebel kidnappings of osce personnel the osce has been ineffective in observing the border and also the cease fire . 
  let 's not confuse observing a agreed upon cease fire with fake election . 
  the timing and the type of the missile is the message . 
  i do n't know . 
  why are you going to panic ? 
  i do n't know what to make of this : [ footage from dpr elections ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=cy5rzwmiojq ), 
  plesetsk is a missile testing range . 
  they test missiles over there . 
  considering the events during recent months what 's notable here is the timing and the type of the missile . 
  granted , it 's an inflammable title . 
  let me elaborate . 
  yeah , there 's apparently one person from the usa but interestingly 13 persons from the eu countries . 
  those guys are members and also representatives of their ( mostly far right ) parties . 
  they 're also entering ukraine illegally without visa through russia which is apparently okay for russia despite signing the minsk agreement . 
  also the election itself is against the ukrainian law , the minsk agreement , and has been deemed illegitimate by the un , the eu , the us ect . 
  and so far the only country claiming to recognise the illegitimate election has been russia ( again , despite the signing of the minsk agreement ) . 
  russian propaganda media incl\u00fading the rt [ claimed earlier that they were osce observers ] ( https://twitter.com/robpulsenews/status/528634681320017920 ) . 
  after that [ the osce said ] ( https://twitter.com/osce_smm/status/528625628237811713 ) it has not sent observers to the `` so-called `` elections '' in east ukraine '' . 
  so , those guys invented a sham organisation to fool people , the asce or the `` agency for security and cooperation in europe '' , under which to observe the illegitimate election : [ sham observer org for ukrainian separatist strongholds invented day before election ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/sham-observer-org-for-ukrainian-separatist-strongholds-invented-day-before-election/article21418834/ ) as disgusting and disheartening the title is , it is also apparently correct . 
  source for the list of names : [ fake monitors `` observe '' fake elections in donbas ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/11/01/fake-monitors-observe-fake-elections-in-donbas/ ), 
  but it 's only an anti-fascist missile of peace, 
  yup , considering [ the sudden changes to negative in turkish attitudes towards other countries around 2006-7 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kz5rn/turkey_does_not_like_europe_at_all_really_with/clqqdcl ) it certainly looks like something canged within turkey itself and has remained so . 
  silly tourists . 
  clearly we do n't have lame rock churches but [ metal masses ] ( http://metallimessu.com/media/metallimessun-esittelyvideo/ ) . 
   finnish people being a depressed bunch . 
  that 's racist , we 're a * violent * bunch perkele . 
  well , [ putin , highlighting shameless liars , bitterly calls goebbels a ` talented man ' ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/putin-calls-goebbels-a-talented-man-at-meeting-with-rabbis/ ), 
  while some of those may be valid reasons , i do n't think they fully explain the sudden jump because roughly around 2006-2007 significant jumps to negative happened also with many other countries remaining negative since . 
  to me that seems to indicate that the jumps to negative may be because of a change within turkey itself . 
  look at the pew results polling turkish attitudes towards different countries , nations , and organisations in different years : http://www.pewglobal.org/question-search/?keywordtext=favorable&amp;btnsubmit=search&amp;topic=&amp;startdate=&amp;enddate=&amp;chkcntstndr224=on&amp;txtareacntidsstndr=%40224-&amp;txtareastdids= during last few years turks have disliked every foreign country or organisation they have been asked about : the eu , the un , iran , usa , china , russia , france , saudi arabia , brazil , nato , pakistan , south korea , egypt , india , israel , americans , chinese ... 
  but it was n't always so . 
  something happened around 2006-7 and after . 
  according to the results ( latest year ) : eu ( 2013 ) was liked before but disliked since 2007 un ( 2013 ) was liked before but disliked since 2006 iran ( 2014 ) was liked before but disliked since 2006 usa ( 2014 ) always disliked but even more since 2006-2007 china ( 2014 ) always disliked but even more since 2006-2007 france ( 2013 ) always disliked but even more since 2006 saudi arabia ( 2013 ) was liked in 2007 but disliked after that russia ( 2014 ) always disliked but only asked since 2007 pakistan ( 2012 ) always disliked but only asked since 2008 nato ( 2013 ) always disliked but only asked since 2011 egypt ( 2007 ) disliked but the only year asked india ( 2008 ) disliked but the only year asked south korea ( 2008 ) disliked but the only year asked israel ( 2013 ) disliked but the only year asked brazil ( 2014 ) disliked but the only year asked they did still like japan a bit in 2008 and germany a tiny bit in 2006 but both with negative trends and as those are the last years the countries were included can not say how it went after that . 
  under recent years the only country turks have clearly liked is turkey ( 2012 ) and the only politician erdogan ( 2013 ) . 
  and i do n't think that 's because every other country or their policies might have continuously failed turkey since 2006-7 .
