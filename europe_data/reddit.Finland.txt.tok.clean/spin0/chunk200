  it 's all bullshit . 
  please stop spreading this crap . 
  maslo55 , could you please provide the essential information i asked earlier :  have you op actually read `` the proposal '' ? 
  could you provide a link to it please ? 
  to me it looks more and more that nordichardware 's story , which was dubious at the very beginning , is bullshit . 
  there is no evidence to support it 's dubious claims nor does the blog post provide it . 
  the only source nhw provides is a preliminary study from 2007 . 
  it 's outdated . 
  it has been freely available since 2007 -- yet the blog piece chooses to call it `` exclusive information '' . 
  :d nothing in nhw 's story adds up , and there 's no evidence for it 's wild claims about `` the proposal '' which seems to not exist . 
  so i call bullshit . 
   do you have another source that says there wo n't be a limit based on memory bandwidth ? 
  first of all : one can not prove a negative - as nonexistence of something ( try disproving [ russels teapot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russell%27s_teapot ) ) . 
  believing that something exists just because there is no proof of it 's nonexistence is not rational . 
  instead the existence of something is provable by providing adequate evidence to support it . 
  with that in mind read nordichardware 's blogpost . 
  does it provide the evidence to support it 's claims ? 
  nope . 
  the blogpost claims `` exclusive information '' but their source is a preliminary study which has been freely available since 2007 . 
  that 's hardly `` exclusive '' . 
  the study in question concerns voluntary energy labels ( such as energy star ) . 
  a voluntary label does not `` cripple '' any hardware or in any way prevent manufacturers from improving their products . 
  the study in question is from 2007 !, 
  it 's over five years old . 
  it 's outdated . 
  it 's categories are not relevant any more . 
  there is no such directive or proposal that nordichardware is claiming . 
  and if there was then i would ask for the evidence of it 's existence before believing it . 
  the article does not provide any evidence or source for that , just an years ago outdated preliminary study which fails as evidence . 
  nordichardware 's story is dubious and makes unsupported claims . 
  so i call bullshit . 
  but ymmv etc. 
  exactly . 
  nordichardware 's story is bullshit and was dubious from the beginning -- with claims of `` exclusive information '' that actually has been freely available since 2007 and is out of date already . 
  what proposals exactly ? 
  could you provide a link to the proposal ? 
  the blog post in op 's link claims all kinds of things but provides only one source : * `` the specification for the so called eco design lot 3 with the ec can be found [ here ] ( http://www.ecocomputer.org/ ) '' * when you go to the link it 's just a preliminary study which has been available since 2007 . 
  hardly any `` exclusive information '' as the blog post claims . 
  and the study is about * voluntary * energy labels . 
  it 's five years old . 
  five year old * voluntary * categories hardly cripple any future hardware as the blog post seems to claim . 
  the blog post bases it 's claims on a preliminary study from 2007 . 
  the classifications there concern * voluntary * energy labels like energy star and such . 
  so besides five years old it 's about * voluntary * labels . 
  one can hardly claim that they cripple hardware or prevent manufacturers from innovating better products . 
  have you op actually read `` the proposal '' ? 
  could you provide a link to it please ? 
  the blog post you linked contains only a preliminary study published in 2007 . 
  the document is about * voluntary * labels like energy star and their categories . 
  it is very far fetched to claim that * voluntary * labels cripple hardware . 
  if it 's any consolation your post actually was informative despite the whoosh . 
  and the particular preparatory study has been available since 2007 on project 's website here : http://www.ecocomputer.org/ ( documents ) from op 's link : * `` nordichardware has seen exclusive information about a new energy law that will apply within the eu . 
  '' * sure they have . 
  the information has been freely available for over five years , ffs . 
  i 've visited and worked in us , especially in south : texas , lousiana and florida . 
  i see no reason to stay away from there since people there were very welcoming . 
  maybe you should try that too - go and see for yourself . 
  i 'm not from us . 
  i did not say you 're bad country . 
  i said i 'm going to keep away from your country if i can . 
  c'mon , why you so sensitive and defensive all of sudden ? 
  now you remind me of those muslim protestors . 
  freedom to protest is one fo the basic principles of a democratic society . 
  and even `` bitching about '' is . 
  but do n't worry , i 'll gtfo out of your country , not gon na visit for a long time i hope . 
  are you saying denmark should start outcasting people from society based on their opinions or beliefs ? 
  i thought the last time it was imposed on denmark was not a particular success , but maybe i 'm wrong since not danish or an historian . 
  it 's not shocking . 
  it 's crap . 
   did you even read what i wrote -- or did you read what you wanted to read ? 
  well , sad to say you certainly did with your misleading reprsentation of the statisticiscs concerned and with your baseless assumtions from there on . 
  modwolfalpha , glad to hear a rational voice , and just to let you know : qph 's statistics are not what he represents them to be . 
  see my reply here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/zx1w3/swedens_rape_statistics_under_the_spotlight/c68ytpd, 
  qph :  yet i 'd like to see the statistics of the , ahem , ethnicity of the rapists . 
  during 2000 -- 2007 in helsinki , finland , a shocking 41,4 % of rapes were commited by immigrants , whose total number of the population is only 8,3 % . 
  incorrect . 
  your statistics concerns only ** suspects ** . 
  a suspect does not equal to a rapist and a suspicion does not equal to an actual rape by him . 
  your statistics is cherrypicked from year 2008 . 
  it does not include the data available through 2012 . 
  here \u00b4 s data from 2012 of rape suspects in finland ( not just helsinki ) : http://kuvat.uusisuomi.fi/sites/default/files/imagecache/suurennettu/kuvat/raiskaukset-taulukko.jpg and there you can see the amazing effect ** even a single person ** can achieve in finnish rape-statistics . 
  in 2010 there was one guy from morocco who 's was a suspected of about 150 accounts of rape and sexual violence ( i do not know about his probable convictions ) . 
  but you can see how suspects from morocco went from 1 in 2009 to amazing 156 in 2010 and then back to 1 in 2011 . 
  i 'm not a statiscian by trade but i 'd call that an outlier and dismiss as such . 
  qph :  i 'm just stating the facts some people do n't want to admit -- in many african cultures it is okay to rape . 
  3 . you go from `` 41,4 % immigrants '' to `` african cultures '' in one giant illogical and incorrect leap . 
  which is incorrect since many of suspected rapists are not from africa but from eg . 
  iraq , estonia , russia ... 4 . it 's obviously is not that much about africa at all . 
  5 . you forget to account for age and social status . 
  it is common knowledge that young men are more often suspected of rape than old men . 
  and we know young men do rape more often than older . 
  and most of immigrants are young . 
  this skews the statistics and you should account for that . 
  but you do n't . 
  remember : * `` the best way to prevent violent crime is to become 30 years old '' * , as they say even in finnish crime statistics ( please do read them and relevant studies , they are freely available in oikeuspoliittinen tutkimuslaitos ) . 
   it makes you a man , even cures aids . 
  we must admit this as reality so we can fight against it -- not the africans themselves , but the attitude , their medieval superstitions . 
  if they ca n't handle living in a modern western country , they should be thrown out . 
  not because they 're black but because they 're utterly unfit for our way of life . 
  regardless of their skin colour .
