  it is old ? 
  ok . tentacles and lolis . 
  i hear from [ a russian correspondent ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c5cko/russia_bans_polish_fruit_and_vegetables_in/cjc4pbq ) that there may be some clop involved . 
  is this acceptable or too mainstream ? 
  yes ? 
  i 'm not familiar with it . 
  probably because your screen has n't been calibrated for lame , ordinary european foodstuff such as apples and veggies . 
  works as soon as they ban polish tentacles . 
  what 's a ` mlp tweet ' ? 
   wto also forbids sectorial sanctions . 
  if you 're referring to the sanctions imposed by the eu they 're indeed legal - or at least the eu has been very careful with the legality . 
  and if russia feels like challenging them in a court they 're certainly free to do so . 
  otoh , as has often been the case with russia 's silly ` bans ' , the sudden finding of `` violation of certification and the identification of quarantine '' of specific polish products does not sound like anything more than arbitrary . 
  now , poland could indeed take that to the court , or they could assess that this particular thing is too small of a nuisance to actually make a case of and pursue it . 
  this is also the reason why russia is always so keen of small and very specific arbitrary bans . 
  never . 
  is only of western propaganda . 
  now go back to sleep . 
   why do they even bother making this shit up ? 
  and just as before they hope they will not get dragged to the court for violating treaties over a small thing ( and i do n't mean small for the farmers affected ) . 
  more delicious , high quality and reasonably priced polish apples for us finns to consume . 
  thanks putin . 
   us-supported `` good guys '' firing ballistic missiles in ukraine ? 
  with cep of 95 m ukraine 's ss-21 scarab b is more accurate than the grad ballistic rockets while having a longer range . 
  they 're armed with conventional he warheads . 
  ukraine has no nuclear warheads . 
  in fact russia gave its security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of ukraine when ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear stockpile . 
  and that 's just one of the broken promises and treaties by russia . 
  ukraine is not firing them into other countries like russia has been doing with artillery and ballistic rockets . 
  but russia has been bringing ballistic missiles to the border , and it seems just a matter of time as the situation of russian terrorists is getting weaker by day . 
   the soviets made huge orders of textiles and other goods , and paid for it in oil and hard cash . 
  the trade between finland and the soviet union was [ clearing trade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bilateral_trade ) where payments were not hard currency but services and goods - especially oil . 
  over time the su accumulated a large debt in trade deficits . 
  later on russia paid that debt in goods , services , and currency . 
  according to this the final installment was 2006 : [ oil-rich russia pays off soviet debt to finland ahead of schedule ] ( http://www.hs.fi/english/article/oil-rich+russia+pays+off+soviet+debt+to+finland+ahead+of+schedule/1135220976005 ), 
  looks like your browser has become possessed . 
  have you already tried [ un-blessing and then re-blessing it ? 
  just a couple more for the collection https://i.imgur.com/ielrocy.gif http://i.imgur.com/nhphcym.gif, 
   nobody will start seizing assets , i guess we 'll see about that . 
   plus russia could do the exact same back . 
  only if by ` exact same ' you mean ` very different ' because they can not * legally * seize assets as they like . 
  also ,  the award is enforceable and russia has a 180-day grace period to pay it . 
  if russia resists , state-owned assets can be seized internationally in the over 150 states that are members of the new york convention . 
  russia will likely object to the enforcement of the award on the basis of sovereign immunity during enforcement proceedings , which will buy it time , but will not stop the award 's enforcement . 
  after 15 january 2015 , interest will accrue annually to the award . 
  as this is not an icsid award , russia will not have the possibility of bringing icsid annulment proceedings to buy further time . 
  as per the international arbitration attorney network : [ yukos owners win largest arbitration award in history against russia for `` devious and calculated '' expropriation . 
  ] ( http://www.international-arbitration-attorney.com/yukos-owners-win-largest-arbitration-award-history-russia-devious-calculated-expropriation/ ), 
  in finland water supply is handled at the municipal level ( not state , thank fsm ) . 
  providers are most often co-ops owned by customers or municipally owned companies . 
  overall the water quality is top notch ( ` world 's best ' according to unesco but i do n't know what that even means - the water 's good and that 's all there is to me ) . 
  no , i do n't think water supply should be state run . 
  i think it 's better to handle it at the municipal level and leave it to state only to regulate as necessary . 
  fun fact : in helsinki metropolitan area the drinking water has the seal of approval of [ trouts ] ( http://www.tiede.fi/artikkeli/jutut/artikkelit/kala_tuntee_kuulee_ja_juttelee ) rendering their service for over million people . 
  the water is taken from a large lake and flows by gravity through [ a 120 km tunnel in the bedrock ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4ij%c3%a4nne_water_tunnel ) . 
  it 's already drinkable when taken form the lake , but get 's sampled , treated , analyzed and monitored as per usual . 
  and then there 's the trout test . 
  trouts are good for the job because they 're cool , laidback sort of guys and yet very sensitive . 
  as migrating fishes they have a very acute sense of smell and react to tiniest changes in the water . 
  their breathing , heartbeat and behavior is monitored , and if there 's anything amiss - which other tests have n't caught - or if the water tastes funny to them they will alarm . 
  just taking this opportunity to recommend [ sofia 's last ambulance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sofia%27s_last_ambulance ) , an old school cinema verite documentary about the absurdities of the eroding health care system at bulgaria 's capital . 
  and tyler durden is a fictional character with some serious mental issues . 
   i 'm surprised putin and his thugs have n't just bullied them into shutting down . 
  they likely wo n't shut it down rather than try and keep it in check . 
  for keeping up appearences in putin 's system of ruling it is necessary for the elite to allow a homeopathic dose of democratic institutions and other such poisons . 
   but banning an entire party seems a bit excessive a party has not been banned . 
  i think there has been some confused reporting on the issue . 
  what is dissolved here is the communist parliamentary group not the party itself . 
  and the communist mps were not ousted from the parliament . 
  the reason for dissolution was that the group does not adhere to the rule of having mps from regional election . 
  as no communists got elected in regional elections they were actually given one mp to join them and to form a parliamentary group . 
  but after the mp left the group it does not fulfill the rule . 
  no party was banned here . 
  no-one was ousted from the parliement , and all communist mps are still members of parliament . 
   they 're invited to go home . 
  those cities are their home country , as opposed to terrorists from russia , chechenia and ossetia . 
  perhaps it 's them who should `` go home '' . 
   let 's be honest here , this kind of shit would happen in every country no . 
   there 's scum everywhere . 
  perhaps there is , but we 're talking about minimun common decency here . 
  to me your abuse of relativism as an excuse is almost as shocking as the looting itself . 
   however , the manner in which the impeachment was done was almost assuredly not legal . 
  that almost part is only one of your problems . 
   thus , yanukovych 's impeachment was , by the definition of the ukrainian constitution , unlawful . 
  perhaps you should actually either learn all the relevant legislation ( i 'm not sure if you 're aware of it , but the relevant law in ukraine is quite a bit longer than your mere cherrypicking ) or seek the concensus of relevant ukrainian legal scholars or take your claims to an actual court to test them . 
  and i have to repeat : your accusations are pretty serious and you better have a very good case to present . 
  do you ? 
   but you are right , i am by no means a legal expert , indeed you are not . 
  far from it . 
  but yet you seem to hold yourself as an adequate jugde without even knowing the laws you 're ruling upon . . 
  you got me . 
  i live on hate . 
  i only visit threads to spread hate and `` opinionated bullshit '' . 
  guilty !, 
   hey we can all have opinions , oh we can ? 
  well , are n't you generous . 
  i love you . 
  i love you . 
  you into homosex ? 
   opinionated too .
