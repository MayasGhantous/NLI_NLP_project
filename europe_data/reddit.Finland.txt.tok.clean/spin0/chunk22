  guilty !, 
  i 'm very much of the opinion that the comments you have posted in this particular thread so far are stupid . 
   the overthrow of yanukovych was against the ukrainian constitution . 
  however , the impeachement was not against constitution . 
  i do know he himself has claimed so but his case is rather weak and certainly not supported by the concensus of relevant ukrainian legal scholars . 
  with your nonsensical claims you seem to believe you have the necessary or even adequate experteese about matters concerning the relevant legislation and constitution in ukraine . 
  i do not believe you have . 
  basically : do what you should do and take your claims to an actual court . 
  you seem to believe you 're personally running a court judging what is unconstistutial and what is not . 
   the west has there 's no such thing . 
  you 're probably very very very misguided to believe in it . 
  i wish you the best of luck in the future . 
   russia may be arming seperatists in eastern ukraine , just as the us and eu are supplying the government with weapons , but why ? 
  could you please provide examples of these alleged weapons that you claim the us and eu has supplied ? 
   hmury : did it come with a crew ? 
    buryat : yes , with a crew . 
  oh shi ... is there an ukrainian word for that ? 
  busted . 
  yep , and pretty much everyone else relevant or at least capable of having any idea what we 're talking about has been aware of that all since those notams were issued . 
  like yesterday . 
  except of course ` tyler turden ' - the idiot catering for even more stupid idiots who just loooooooooove to eat his crap and then provide it to everyone else as copy-pasta . 
  oh , a ` well known ' . 
  so tell me : who wrote that blogpost you 've fallen in love with ? 
  also present in finland and afaik pretty much all over europe or the globe . 
  and there 's also hells angs and what not others . 
  organized crime has been networking just as legitimate business has . 
   and by seizing an aa stockpile from the ukrainian army , which is what most likely happened in this case . 
  targeting , shooting and hitting with such missile takes a lot more than merely seizing an aa stockpile . 
  a full buk system consists of multiple vehicles with multiple purposes and takes about 30 expert personnel to operate . 
  the vehicles can operate separately but i do n't know the maximum distances involved . 
  at the end of june the terrorists boasted they had captured a buk missile launch vehicle ( telar ) and posted images of it which they have now deleted . 
  but that vehicle does have the target aquisition radar which is a separate vehicle ( tar ) . 
  the very relevant question is : who did the target aquisition ? 
  and where ? 
  the terrorists did not have a tar vehicle and never said they had . 
   such fact 's , many wow . 
  you posted a blogpost by some ` tyler turden ' . 
   care to elaborate on where you got your intel ? 
  as i see you got your ` intel ' ( whatever you belive that means ) from a ` tyler turden ' . 
  care to elaborate on where you got your ` intel ' ? 
  until your conclusive evidence the answer to your posted question is as it should be : no . 
  and will remain so . 
  yep , there indeed was a notan issued at 00:00 z or about 10hrs before malaysian 17 departure . 
  but it concerned the routes up to fl320 . 
  mh17 and other civilian aircrafts flew at higher altitude at fl330 . 
  and because the route is essentially on the grand circle between europe and se asia it is very popular among airlines and has been in constant use . 
  there were numerous other civilian airliners on that route at high altitude such as singapore airlines sq351 and air india ai113 . 
  here they are [ flying near the malaysian 17 when it disappeared ] ( http://pbs.twimg.com/media/bsxf_j_ccaaycni.png:large ) . 
  your feeling of great conveniece in a midst of tragedy is quite intriguing . 
  please do refrain from sending me your newsletters . 
   the only plane flying over restricted air space takes a complete idiot to make such claim . 
   and it was shot down . . yep . 
  on this only fact i agree with . 
  a civilian plane flying in a popular civilian airway , at civilian altitude , at civilian cruise speed , with civilian course and with a civilian transponder telling that it indeed was a civilian aircraft was shot down . 
   was flight mh-17 diverted over restricted airspace ? 
   my apologies , the link i saw showed that their flight plan straddled the ukraine-russia border , not flying right over donetsk . 
  i do n't know what you have seen . 
  there was no flight plan on that particular link . 
  see the image in my message for the flight plan . 
   i mean , who would have thought they would fly over donetsk when a su-26 was just shot down yesterday , along with two cargo and one more jet fighter planes ? 
  i do n't know . 
  is this a serious question or just a play on rhetorics ? 
  because i 'm not interested in playing such games . 
  imo the relevant question is who the hell aims and shoots a civilian aircraft cruising at high altitude on its route and then boasts about it . 
   i 'm not sure i understand your second statement though , can you elaborate ? 
  why would n't the airspace be closed or at least advised against flying over if the rebels have manpads and now large truck-based sams ? 
  there was a relevant notam issued at 00:00 z or about 10hrs before malaysian 17 departure . 
  however , it concerned the routes up to fl320 . 
  malaysian 17 flew higher at fl330 . 
  and because the route is essentially on the grand circle between europe and se asia it is very popular among airlines . 
  there were numerous other civilian airliners on that route at high altitude today such as singapore airlines sq351 and air india ai113 . 
  here they are [ flying near the malaysian 17 when it disappeared ] ( http://pbs.twimg.com/media/bsxf_j_ccaaycni.png:large ) . 
   the stated flight plan of the plane . 
  no flight plan appeared in that link . 
  here 's today 's flight plan of malaysian 17 : fpl-mas17-is - b772/h-sdfghij 3j5m1rwxy/lb1d1 - eham1000 - n0490f310 arnem ul620 suvox uz713 osn ul980 mobsa dct povel dct sui l980 utolu/n0490f330 l980 ldz m70 bembi l980 pekit/n0480f350 l980 ** tamak/n0480f350 a87 tirom/n0490f350 a87 ** mamed b449 ranah l750 zb g201 bi dct murli dct tiger/n0490f370 l333 kkj l759 put r325 vih a464 dakus dct - wmkk1137 wmsa wmkp - eet/edgg0017 edww0023 eduu0036 epww0052 uklv0135 ukbv0153 ukdv0225 urrv0255 uatt0347 utak0411 utaa0432 utav0507 oakx0518 oplr0601 opkr0616 vidf0631 vabf0725 vecf0747 vyyf0926 vomf0930 vtbb1013 wmfc1051 reg/9mmrd pbn/a1b1c1d1l1o1s2 sel/qrej dof/140717 rmk/acasii equipped it looks like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4cmteyw.png )  it gets even stupider , the ukrainian army closed the airspace over that area , due to military operations . 
  look at the date , the airspace was not closed . 
  but there was a notam issued ( notice to airmen ) : urrv v6158/14 17jul0000-31aug2359 est due to combat actions on the territory of the ukraine near the state border with the russian federation and the facts of frng fm the territory of the ukraine towards the territory of russian federation , to ensure intl flt safety , ats rte segments clsd as flw : a100 mimra - rostov-na-donu vor/dme ( rnd ) , b145 kanon - asmil , g247 mimra - bagayevskiy ndb ( ba ) , ** a87 tamak - sarna ** the route segment a87 was in the flight plan ( bolded ) . 
   to be fair , `` rebels '' have no planes , they have boasted they have . 
   so the only planes that fly around there ( up until now ) were the ones that bombed cities you 're forgetting the civilian airliners using that corridor . 
  well , it 's bit too late for them to deny it now after they bragged about shooting a plane down in the same area around the same time . 
  um . . your source says it 's unlikely that the plane was shot down . 
  here 's the list : [ ukraine-related sanctions ; publication of executive order 13662 sectoral sanctions identifications list ] ( http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/ofac-enforcement/pages/20140716.aspx ), 
   what 's behind europe 's decision to back away from hydraulic fracturing ? 
  there has been no such decision . 
  in fact the eu decided to leave it to national goverments instead : [ eu ditches plan to regulate on shale gas ] ( http://euobserver.com/news/122835 ) also : [ eu parliament excludes shale gas from tougher environmental code ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/12/eu-shalegas-idusl6n0m932o20140312 ), 
   in my opinion this is relevant  north dakota , the nation 's no . 
  2 oil producer behind texas , also produces millions of barrels of briny wastewater daily that can be 30 times saltier than sea water and must be sequestered underground forever . 
  you do realize the briny wastewater is a byproduct of * oil drilling * , right ? 
  and what those articles discuss is the briny wastewater from oil drilling which has leaked from a broken pipeline . 
  i can not see why you believe it is relevant to fracking which is a different technique . 
  when oil is drilled the well brings out oil and gas deep from the ground . 
  but that 's not all . 
  there 's also other stuff such as naturally occuring water which has lied underground for a long time and has become very salty by minerals . 
  and an oil well may bring a lot of such water up . 
  as there 's no use for it the naturally occuring briny water is considered waste and is injected back into the ground where it came from . 
  for that there 's separate injection wells which do not produce oil but are for dumping the water back . 
   when will it go into effect ? 
  there 's no set date yet . 
  before going into effect the ceta needs to be ratified in canada and in all 28 eu members which will probably take about 1-2 years or perhaps longer . 
   iceland would beg to differ .
