  how so ? 
  iceland was out of credit market for three years . 
  to survive they got cheap emergency loans from the imf and bilaterally from other nordic and european countries . 
  iceland returned to credit market in 2011 at the same time as latvia did : [ investors buy into iceland and latvia debt issues ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/09/markets-bonds-iceland-idusn0918698920110609 ) and now iceland is planning to return to eurobond market too : [ iceland plans return to euro bond market ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6b87eb56-05c6-11e4-9baa-00144feab7de.html#axzz37mftlara ), 
   anyway , what do you do with the other hand ? 
  make the necessary calculations for maintaining balance and a properly arcing clean stream . 
  pretty basic physics which boys learn at an early age . 
  meanwhile : [ 126 independently funded studies ] ( http://www.biofortified.org/genera/studies-for-genera/independent-funding/ ), 
  it is indeed about banning or not banning * a product * ( gm crops ) from the market , not about business practises which are regulated by other legislation . 
  additionally , it makes no sense to ban a product on the grounds of a company 's business practices . 
  for example , it would not make sense whatsoever to ban water if you 'd find a water company breaching business legislation , what would make sense instead is for example fining the company in question accordingly . 
   in general debt is not based on new prices , no one would pay on time otherwise . 
  and your general observation is relevant to the issue because ? 
   contracts and rebates are just excuses in a purely commercial negotiation . 
  yep , gazprom pricing schemes in a nutshell : first set an absurdly high contract price , then negotiate ` discounts ' with ` conditions ' attached . 
  then putin can cancel the ` discount ' at will when needed . 
   so why is europe so much against south stream anyway ? 
  because the project is in breach of eu law , and against the eu anti-trust policy and the liberalisation of the energy market ( the third energy package ) . 
   the higher price was brought in later because ukraine already owed more than $ 2bn . 
  gazprom changed the price when russia breached and unilaterally declared the kharkov agreement null and void . 
  yep , that is the positive here . 
  does n't make the deal not silly though - it still is a compromise with stupid . 
   what makes you think the eu scientists can make better calls than the national ones ? 
  wut what is a `` national scientist '' ? 
  are they doing `` national science '' ? 
  and `` eu scientists '' do `` eu science '' ? 
  i 'd say science is just science , and research and its results should be rewieved by their own merit and not by the nationality of the researchers . 
  and if results are compelling and hold water then they should have weight when deciding upon relevant policies . 
  if scientific research demonstrates that a gm-product is not harmful there 's very little reason to ban it . 
  and vice versa . 
   the key point of the accord gives individual eu states the right to ban gm crops -- even if they have already won clearance on health and safety grounds at the eu level . 
  so , they can ban products even when cleared as safe to use and consume . 
  going by fears instead of research and science is just stupid . 
  and that is exactly what eu chief scientific adviser ann glover has warned against . 
  also [ chief eu scientist backs damning report urging gmo ` rethink ' ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/science-policymaking/chief-eu-scientist-backs-damning-news-530693 ) [ eu chief scientist : ` it is unethical not to use gm technology ' ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/science-policymaking/eu-chief-scientist-unethical-use-interview-530692 ), 
   seems fair . 
  fair ? 
  hardly . 
  even ` discounted ' $ 385 is unreasonably high price and has ` conditions ' attached . 
   but they do n't have a right to subsidized gas from russia which was a form of foreign aid in itself . 
  as the price is highest in europe $ 485 per 1,000 cubic meters it 's hardly any form of ` aid ' nor ` subsidized ' . 
  additionally that price is to be paid for a set volume of gas whether the gas is actually delivered or used . 
  average price for gazprom gas in europe is about $ 380 . 
  that includes the transport which is far far longer to the european hubs than to ukraine which is right next to russia . 
  a reasonable market price for gazprom gas in ukraine would be bit below $ 300 including trasport . 
  in the negotiations gazprom 's last offered contract price was $ 485 . 
  they also offered a ` discount ' of $ 100 with conditions , so the ` discounted ' price would be $ 385 which is still extraordinaly high and comes with unspecified conditions . 
  no wonder ukraine declined , and they have very good case to go to stockholm . 
  ingorance and arrogance is a vicious compound for a person to wallow in . 
  state statistic service of ukraine : [ foreign trade in goods , 2013 ] ( http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2013/zd/ztt/ztt_e/ztt1213_e.htm ) exports russia $ 15.1 bn eu-28 $ 16.8 bn imports russia $ 23.2 bn eu-28 $ 27.0 bn now , carefully observe the numbers above . 
  then ask yourself which of the numbers are bigger , and reflect accordingly . 
   aa created a trade wall the only trade wall created here have been russia 's embargoes of various ukrainian goods - breaching the wto rules and treaties in doing so . 
   the east pays the bills and the rest of ukraine pays east 's bills with subsidies . 
   the trade is predominately russian ukraine 's biggest trade partner is the eu both in exports and imports . 
  that offer may look like a carrot but apparently includes the stick : * `` gazprom proposed its ukrainian partners the same conditions that the government of yanukovych had -- a $ 100 discount from the contract price , the final price of $ 385 of per 1,000 cubic meters , '' he said * so the actual contract price would be the ridiculously high $ 485 but there would be ' a discount ' with conditions which makes it just another tool for extortion . 
  i mean , what else could be the purpose of these discount-with-conditions schemes and not simply going with the market price . 
  yep , he was a great king . 
  and every year we fly finnish flags in rememberance of him as gustavus adolphus day ( 6 november ) is a flag day in finland too . 
  albeit nowadays it 's called * svenska dagen * and if you ask man on the street many will not know its origin and remember the lion of the north . 
  another example of a prominent king fondly remembered here in finland is gustav vasa . 
  yes he has a reputation of being a tyrant . 
  but then again at least here in finland he showed he was willing and capable to listen to his subjects and even change his policies when proven wrong . 
  +1 and [ gustav vasa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustaf_wasa ) , he was a pretty cool guy spending time in finland and fixing things like addressing the complaints of peasants , upgrading defences , and establishing helsinki . 
  of the russian monarchs the obvious choise - without much competition as the rest was mostly crap - is the grand prince of finland [ alexander ii of russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_ii_of_russia#encouraging_finnish_nationalism ) . 
   i do n't quit understand i 'll clarify . 
  the 2008-12 reduction of emissions happened ** mostly ** due to lower carbon intensity of energy ( e.g. 
  more renewables ) and decrease in primary energy intensity ( e.g. 
  improved energy efficiency ) which are both results of * changes in policies and adoption of cleaner alternatives * . 
  and while the decrease of gdp per capita was a factor , it 's effect was smaller than that of either of those two . 
   is you meant to point out that i made a wrong assumption by claiming this would be a factor of less significance indeed you understand what i was saying . 
   what 's extremely sad about this is that the dip since 2008 probably is n't all that much caused by changed policies and industries looking for cleaner alternatives , as it is by people being unable to afford gas and cars , and less production of goods in general . 
  actually it 's the other way round . 
  while the decrease of gdp per capita was one factor , the 2008-12 reduction of emissions happened mostly due to lower carbon intensity of energy ( e.g. 
  more renewables ) and decrease in primary energy intensity ( e.g. 
  improved energy efficiency ) . 
  [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t3qcgah ) eea analysis : [ why did greenhouse gas emissions decrease in the eu between 1990 and 2012 ? 
  ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/why-are-greenhouse-gases-decreasing )  summary 2009 - the strength of the 2009 recession affected all economic sectors in the eu . 
  consumption of fossil fuels ( coal , oil and natural gas ) fell compared to the previous year , mainly due to reduced coal use . 
  the decreased demand for energy linked to the economic recession was accompanied by a strong increase in renewable energy use , which also contributed to lower emissions . 
  sustained growth in the use of renewables was therefore a key factor explaining the strong decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 . 
   summary 2010 - the increase in emissions in 2010 was partly driven by the economic recovery from the 2009 recession in many european countries , which had itself caused substantial emission reductions in 2008 and 2009 in all member states . 
  final energy demand increased by 3.8 % in 2010 , outpacing the increase in economic output ( 2.0 % ) . 
  in 2010 the winter was also colder than in the previous year , leading to increased demand for heating and higher emissions from the residential and commercial sectors . 
  the continued strong increase in renewable energy use and the improved carbon intensity of fossil fuels - underpinned by strong gas consumption - prevented the increase in ghg emissions from being higher . 
   summary 2011 - for the eu as a whole , the 4.1 % decrease in co2 emissions in 2011 came amid positive economic growth in most eu member states . 
  gdp increased by 1.7 % , although economic growth was lower than in 2010 , when gdp increased by 2 % . 
  a milder 2011 winter compared to 2010 can , to a large extent , explain lower fossil fuel emissions . 
  this is because , on average , the higher winter temperatures led to lower heating demand and lower emissions from the residential and commercial sectors . 
  the increase in coal use did not offset a much larger decrease in the consumption of natural gas , and emissions fell as a result . 
   summary 2012 - the 1.1 % decrease in co2 emissions from energy in eu-28 in 2012 came along with economic recession across the eu as a whole . 
  half the eu member states experienced negative economic growth in 2012 . 
  in the other half , positive economic growth in 2012 was lower than in 2011 . 
  the winter in europe was on average colder in 2012 than in 2011 leading to higher heating demand and emissions from households . 
  however , higher residential emissions did not offset much lower emissions in other sectors such as transport and industry . 
  also , the increase in coal use in 2012 did not offset a much larger decrease in the consumption of oil natural gas . 
  there was also a substantial increase in renewable energy in 2012 , continuing the long-term trend observed since 1990 .

   i bet the finns have the best russian jokes . 
  as a nordic country most of our jokes are about our nordic bros especially sweden , the neighbor we love more than we like to admit , and there is a lot of jokes about swedes but not that many about russians . 
  there are some about the shitty quality of russian cars and products , though .
