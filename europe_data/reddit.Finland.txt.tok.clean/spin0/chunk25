  your hat ? 
   if russia decides to impose sanctions on finland , it will hurt , a lot , and probably drive the country into a depression even with eu help and of course nato can not provide any protection against this . 
  wto , as such ` sanctions ' would be breaking the rules and the treaties russia has ratified . 
   i understand a lot of people are scared because of crimea but i 'm skeptical of how beneficial a nato membership would really be . 
  i understand some people may be scared of unlikely russian trade sanctions but i see nato membership as the better choise for finland in the long term . 
  it is very unlikely there would be an eu defence alliance as the weu which was touted as such in the 90s is gone , it is also unlikely there would be a defence alliance between sweden and finland ( btw , for some reason russia opposes this too ) . 
  therefore nato is and will be the de facto defence alliance in the eu , and i 'd rather have finland as a part of that . 
  russia has started to think , talk , and act in an outdated imperial ` sphere of influence ' mode . 
  despite that being so past century russia actually believes it has a right to have a ` sphere of influence ' subverting the sovereignity of its neighbouring countries . 
  it is rather obvious that their mid-to-long term objective is to have finland in that position once again . 
  i for one do not wish finlandization back . 
  despite the rather weak threats voiced by some russians i am not the slightest afraid of an actual russian invasion . 
  what i am concerned about is russia 's ` sphere of influence ' idea , and how that would play out regarding finland on the long term . 
  i 'd much rather join nato than have finlandization and ` kekkosslovakia ' back . 
   russia has more possibility to diversify its import . 
  in long term yes , but wo n't happen in short to mid term . 
  consider where the biggest russian import markets are : the wealthier than average population centers of st.petersburg and moscow . 
  finland has a lot of transit transports to those regions because finland already has logistical infrastructure for it . 
  russia has been investing into such logistical infrastructure ( e.g. 
  [ big port saint petersburg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_port_saint_petersburg ) ) , but it will still take time for russia to establish the necessary logistics to fully serve those regions . 
   i was hoping for an english-language source like the bbc or the guardian that could verify the `` do you want world war iii to happen ? '', 
  quote . 
  the leading swedish language newspaper in finland [ hbl ] ( http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2014-06-08/616261/vill-ni-vara-med-och-starta-ett-tredje-varldskrig ) did the interview and published it . 
  that happened , has been widely reported in nordic and baltic papers , and i have no reason to believe the quotes in the interview are not accurate . 
  not sure how bbc or guardian should verify it as they were not present . 
  markov is not just a random dude . 
  he heads institute of political research , is a member in the russia 's civic chamber , he meets with putin 1-3 times a month , and during the 2012 presidential election he became putin 's personal envoy . 
  while he does not have a position in the government the guy is close to putin and speaks with putin 's endorsement . 
  additionally , his rhetorics are not an isolated singular event and they 're in line with earlier recent outbursts coming from sources such as russian state media , russian military and goverment ( e.g. 
  calling nato membership ` the red line ' etc ) . 
   russia is our biggest export partner . 
  generally the eu is finland 's biggest export market with 55.2 % share of exports . 
  if you look at it by country then the biggest export partner is sweden , then germany and russia followed by usa , netherlands , uk and china . 
  exports 2013 : sweden $ 6.5 bn ( +3 % from 2012 ) germany $ 5.4 bn ( +3 % ) russia $ 5.4 bn ( -6 % ), 
  are you seriously claiming that the inefficiencies of greek health care system had nothing to do with it ? 
  and it 's all austerity 's fault ? 
  look , with 6 % of gdp to public health care it 's perfectly possible to have a decent health care system . 
  what that needs is decisions by greek government , it 's their responsibility to plan and provide a better and more efficient system . 
  you simply can not blame everything on austerity . 
  yes , the greek health care has less funding now than it did in 2009 . 
  but then again at that time the spending was huge as it had been rapidly rising through the 2000s . 
  now it has been cut back and after the cuts the health care spending per capita is about the same as it was in 2003-4 . 
  it is still decent amount of funding , and it is perfectly possible to have a decent health care system with it . 
  but that is up to greeks themselves . 
  instead of loudly externalising the responsibility and hating people in the process it would make more sense to be asking questions such as : do you want to spend that funding to keep on fostering the inefficiencies of the greek health care system ? 
  do you want a better and more efficient health care system ? 
  whose responsibility that would be ? 
   well without the eu it could devalue its own currency and avoid the harsh austerity makes no sense to do that when you have 16 % budget deficit as greece had . 
  they would have had to cut the deficit anyway . 
  and in 2009-10 the greek governement did consider that option too . 
  they evaluated different options and even had argentinian economists there consulting . 
  the models showed that leaving the euro and going the devaluation route would be poor option . 
  hence they decided to ask for eu/imf funding . 
   i hate people like you , always with your silly rationalisations , absolving yourself of all responsibility hate him all you want but he certainly is not responsible for the greek health care . 
   in health , the key objective of the reforms was to reduce , rapidly and drastically , public expenditure by capping it at 6 % of gdp . 
  the article fails to mention that before that health spending had been rising rapidly at an average rate of 5.7 % per year between 2000 and 2009 and then it fell by 11 % in both 2010 and 2011 . 
  and the spending looks almost oecd average as % of gdp : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l694fnm ) ( source : [ health spending continues to stagnate , says oecd ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-spending-continues-to-stagnate-says-oecd.htm ) )  `` this has nothing to do with the things we 're forcing on them , it 's their own fault , it 's their fault '' . 
  whose fault is this greek peculiarity then : `` there remain ** more physicians per capita in greece than in any other oecd country . 
  ** the number of doctors per capita increased rapidly in greece up to 2008 and stood at 6.1 physicians per 1000 population in 2010 , ** nearly twice as much the oecd average of 3.2 ** . 
  on the other hand , there were only 3.3 nurses per 1000 population in greece in 2009 ( latest year available ) , a much lower figure than the average of 8.7 in oecd countries . 
  ** for many years , there has been evidence of an over-supply of doctors and under-supply of nurses in greece , resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources . 
  ** '' ( source : [ oecd health data 2013 ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/briefing-note-greece-2013.pdf ) ) have you had serious public debate on how to allocate limited resources better ? 
  such as paying for less phycisians , hiring more nurses and probably saving money in the process ? 
  yeah , they 're quite nice . 
  but they do have a certain air of desing by committee , or a taste of vanilla design-with-diplomacy . 
  the architectural designs are presented as generic enough carefully not to depict any particular building in europe . 
  and that i believe is the reason for the structurally strange [ aqueduct in the 5 $ note . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hvzweev ) pretty sure no remaining classical aqueduct actually has the second tier pier right on top of the first tier keystone which would be the worst point to put it onto . 
  some say it depicts the pont du gard aqueduct but [ obviously not . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ctl5z4b ) so , perhaps the strange structural design was artist 's way of fulfilling the criteria of not depicting any particular aqueduct . 
   but switching to the euro will make goods more expensive too , and salaries will stay the same , making everyone poor equally . 
  that 's a quite common misconception . 
  actually the immediate effect on prices when adopting the euro has been tiny compared to inflation . 
  for example when the euro was adopted here in finland there was no discernible spike in prices apart from the normal inflation trend : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xajsoee ) ( consumer price index 2000 = 100 and the adoption of euro ) some prices rose , some fell , and that was about 50/50 : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2intl0 ) ( changes of prices 1/2001 -6 / 2003 ; adoption of the euro ; orange = falling , grey = rising ) but if you go around asking for anecdotes from the average joes many will tell you how the prices rose due to euro despite data and stats telling otherwise . 
  this is probably due to confirmation bias : people more easily note when a price rises . 
  when some prices rose and some fell they tend to remember the rising ones , and conclude that there has been an overall rise of prices even if it did not happen . 
  hold my serfs , i 'm going in . 
   the idea seems a bit silly to me at first glance . 
  yep , sounds like vaporware to me . 
   on the other hand , they plan to do all the spending themselves , so why the hell not ? 
  i hope those ideas do not interfere and further delay constructing the rail baltica via lithuania . 
  well , sir , there 's nothing on earth like a genuine , bona fide , electrified , six-car monorail !, 
   the rise of a new left that is willing to take a risk , even if it can mean failure ( `` compromise '' , `` social democratic turn '' , `` the long march through the institutions '' , etc. ) . 
  wow . 
  did n't know those are fails . 
  i wonder what would not constitute a failure in his philosophy . 
  ah , okay that explains it . 
  thank you . 
  should n't finland be cyan or at least striped with it ? 
  the national coalition party got the most votes and three seats within the epp group . 
  the centre party got bit less votes but also three seats within the alde group . 
  votes share meps national coalition party 390 376 22,59 % 3 ( epp ) centre party 339 895 19,67 % 3 ( alde ), 
   as far as i understand ousting a president according to the law needed 75 % of the parliament votes which never happened . 
  is this your layman opinion or the concensus of relevant ukrainian legal scholars ? 
   they need to fix their problems first . 
  and that 's the plan . 
  the association agreement does provide a framework to co-operate and help in addressing and fixing ukraine 's problems but it remains its own responsibility to do so if it aspires for a membership in the future . 
  ukraine is not about to become a member of the eu any time soon , it is not a candidate country nor has applied for a membership . 
  fulfilling the copenhagen criteria will take many years . 
  in fact all that was also relevant in poland 's accession to the eu and after 1989 poland had similar frameworks for co-operation with the eu to help fixing its problems : 1989 poland signed the agreement for trade and co-operation with the european community ( ec ) .
