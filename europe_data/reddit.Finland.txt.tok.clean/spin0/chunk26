  russian state propaganda claims there is a ` fascist junta ' in power after a ` fascist coup ' in ukraine . 
  that is not correct and the election result is one more fact demonstrating that - among with the lack of fascist policies . 
  the result shows that firstly ` fascism ' does not enjoy wide popular support in ukraine , nor does the far-right , and secondly , if there was a ` fascist junta ' in power they 'd be dysfunctional in their ` fascism ' . 
  an actual fascist junta would have had huge amount of votes as vote rigging and election fraud is one of the hallmarks of them ( * . 
  yet they got only a tiny fraction of votes . 
  the most likely explanation for the lack of fascist policies and election result : there is no ' fascist junta ' in power . 
  it 's a propaganda lie by russian state propagandists . 
  * ) and actually election fraud is the mo of vladimir putin , routinely done in russia and it 's very visible in mathematical analysis - [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t93foro.png ) related blogpost : [ finding the statistical fingerprints of election thieves ] ( http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/pnas-thurner-fingerprints-election-thieves/ ) and the research paper published by pnas : [ statistical detection of systematic election irregularities ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/20/1210722109.abstract ) would be interesting to see similar analysis of the so-salled referendum in crimea . 
   most of that metalwork export goes to russia now by far the biggest volume goes to the eu . 
  in 2013 ukraine exported 28 % of its iron and steel production to the eu , and 10 % to italy alone . 
  turkey 's share of exports is 16 % and russia 's 13 % . 
  [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/itqlwpr )  the deal will turn the ukraine into a breadbasket about 3/4 of ukraine 's exports to the eu are non-agricultural products . 
  here 's the breakdown by sitc section ( 2012 ) : manufactured goods classified chiefly by material 26.0 % crude materials , inedible , except fuels 20.8 % food and live animals 16.2 % machinery and transport equipment 10.5 % mineral fuels , lubricants and related materials 10.1 % chemicals and related prod , n.e.s. 
  4.7 % animal and vegetable oils , fats and waxes 4.4 % miscellaneous manufactured articles 3.9 % commodities and transactions n.c.e. 
  0.2 % beverages and tobacco 0.1 %, 
   in 2012 state statistic service of ukraine : [ foreign trade in goods , 2013 ] ( http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2013/zd/ztt/ztt_e/ztt1213_e.htm ) exports russia $ 15.1 bn eu-28 $ 16.8 bn imports russia $ 23.2 bn eu-28 $ 27.0 bn, 
   hostile relationship with its biggest trading partner might put quite a strain on its economy . 
  ukraine 's biggest trading partner is the eu . 
  the ones calling the hostages osce members are the ones doing the purposeful confusing here . 
  it was you who called the agreement ` one-sided ' . 
  when it was actually bilateral . 
  that is the issue . 
  and i 'm still confused about your stance on it . 
  so , could you please be very clear this time : 1 . 
  was the agreement not bilateral ? 
  if not , why not ? 
  do you or do you not recognise the sovereign state of ukraine ? 
   was what i said to the claims of the hostages actually being on a bilateral mission . 
  yes , they were very much on a bilateral mission . 
   if you speak of bilateral talks in a conflict , you usually mean both conflict parties and not one of the conflict parties and their allies . 
  they were not on ` bilateral talks in a conflict ' . 
  why are you so very keen on forgetting their purpose and mandate , and insisting as if they had no right to be there ? 
  simply : why do you do that ? 
   yes it is . 
  go educate yourself on the osce , its charta and the difference to organizations as nato . 
  no , having that mission does not mean that . 
  that 's why said you 're confusing things in the first place . 
  you seem to be insisting that for that specific mission there should have been arbritrary number of parties agreeing . 
  parties that you do n't even care to name - never mind explaining the reasoning why . 
  and further i say their kidnapping was a violation . 
  do you agree ? 
  and if not why not ? 
   i did n't say it 's not a legitimate source , are you fucking high or something ? 
  ** some hours ago you just said : **  if it was a legitimate source it would 've been somewhere else as well, 
   the osce is based on consent . 
  official missions are decided in agreement with all members ( or at least acceptance ) . 
  for severe violations there is a `` consent minus one '' mechanism that can be used to exclude a country from osce ( this was done in only one case so far ) . 
  yes . 
  and there indeed was consent . 
   in this case mostly russia since the other side of the conflict is not recognized as / has not formed a real government . 
  you just said : `` the relations of germany and ukraine is not the main issue here . '', 
  but now , according to you the goverment of ukraine would have needed the approval of russia for that ? 
  fyi , they did not and i do not understand why you insist that they would have needed such . 
  please do explain . 
   because that 's what it means to have osce missions . 
  that 's not it . 
   and that 's why it was such a bad thing . 
  the russians/rebels agreed to the official missions which were used as a cover to start these `` investigative '' / spying missions . 
  ah , so you 're purposefully confusing things . 
  sorry , at first i thought you were either confused or had a point . 
  now i see that is not the case , and the confusion exists only by your own choise and your claim of an ` one-sided ' agreement was an intented red herring . 
  no matter how many times i read it your objection makes no sense whatsoever . 
  apparently to you only something on some specific ` wiki 's page ' is ` legitimate ' . 
  if that does not sound stupid to you i do n't know what would . 
  it actually is an educational book to read on the subject and very much a legitimate source . 
  yeah , well , that 's not what happened, 
   one-sided in that it was only in agreement with one of the conflict parties . 
  why would they have needed an agreement with anyone else ? 
  and with whom specifically ? 
  and why ? 
   communism has plenty of scientific basis , and you 're full of shit to argue otherwise . 
  wow communist experiment so large scale much success such science many oppression gulag genocide hunger economy disaster just saying that the experimental data collected so far does not look good for communism . 
  real life trials and the very large scale social experiments of implemeting it , involving actual people and societies , have failed everywhere with disastrous consequences to its victims . 
  people arguing against communism do have quite solid basis for their objection . 
  it is actually the communists who seem to lack any scientific basis whatsoever - considering the scale in which their experiments have failed with great human and economic loss . 
   if it was a legitimate source it would 've been somewhere else as well it actually is . 
  and with a very simple search you can find the book in question possibly even in a library near you . 
  it 's not like ` east-central european economies in transition ' is an antiquarian rarity . 
  isbn 1563246120 , 9781563246128, 
   a one-sided agreement between the interim government in kiev and the german government sounds like a bilateral agreement to me , not ` one-sided ' . 
   why are the communists banned and yet parties like svoboda are not ? 
  were not banned . 
  the rada was to have a closed session discussing secret military stuff . 
  the communists tried to turn the session into a public one . 
  as a communist mp essentially prevented the session from starting and thereby were obstructing the meeting of rada he got voted out of the session . 
  according to the relevant procedural law : if a deputy 's behavior is obstructing the meeting of rada , the head of the session issues a personal warning ( to the offending deputy ) and calls them to order . 
  after issuing a repeat warning over the duration of the day , the head of the session , by agreement of the majority of the deputies ( as determined by a vote ) , may request the offending deputy to leave the session room until the end of the session . 
  so , after the vote the communists walked out of the session with some members of the party of regions following , and the rada was able to start the closed session . 
  it is worrisome news in it 's own way , but it 's not that the communist party was ` banned ' . 
   spin0 probably submitted it for shits and giggles . 
  that , also shows the level of delusion in that party and which way their wind blows . 
  [ party of the european left ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_the_european_left ) is a legit european party but being extreme left-wing with communists and all it is marginal on a european level . 
  in the european parliament the party has 21 meps within the parlimentary group [ european united left/nordic green left ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_united_left%e2%80%93nordic_green_left ) . 
   2nd edit : just found this pic of great democratic leader of ukraine yatsenyuk throwing up a nazi salute next to the leader of the official nazi party of ukraine - http://i.imgur.com/fpcafgg.png great , freeze frames of people waving to the crowds is literally nazi now . 
   the state sold off its assets at knock-down prices , with an average increase in profits of 419 % in nine companies from privatisation to 2010 , compared with an ftse100 average of 206 % in the same period . 
  so , after privatisation the companies did significantly better . 
  looks like there is evidence that privatisation works after all . 
   9/11 was a one off created by farcically lax american internal flight security . 
  whoa,
