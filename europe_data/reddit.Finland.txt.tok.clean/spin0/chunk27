   really ? 
  yes , really . 
  because the ballot had no option for maintaining the status quo the organizers claimed that not voting was that option . 
   prove it . 
  it is their claim and their onus to prove it . 
  i call it bs because i do find it very hard to belive that 97 % of crimeans participated in the refendum and 100 % of those voted for annexation . 
  and as i said , there 's not a single poll preceding the referendum supporting that kind of numbers . 
   i guess we 'll never know because they did not get send there in the first place which was my point . 
  they were not sent because the referendum under the circumstances was illegitimate in the first place , and there 's no point in sending osce observers to witness such event . 
  and it 's not only that but also the fact that ** not voting ** was supposed to be counted as a vote for maintaining the status quo . 
  or that 's what the organizers and apologists claimed , that is . 
  and it obviously never was accounted for with the silly claims of 97 % support for annexation . 
  and now we have apologists claiming that only cast votes should count ... cake : how to eat it and keep it . 
  and of course omitting an important option from the ballot is not the way to do a referendum , which just is one of the reasons why it was a complete farce from the beginning and not recognised by the world . 
   even in a totally impartial referendum the vote will most likely be yes since the majority of the peninsula is ethnically russian anyway . 
  and you know this how ? 
  the surveys made before the referendum say otherwise . 
   if you want to make that statement , you first would have to prove that the 30-50 % that did show up was not representative of the population as a whole . 
  no , it is not up to him to prove it . 
  it is up to the referendum organizers to prove it . 
  as the ballot lacked the option to vote for maintaining the status quo , the organizers claimed that * not voting * would be counted as a vote for maintaining the status quo . 
  their claimed result of some 97 % of crimeans voting for annexation is silly bs . 
  additionally you can not find * any polls * preceeding the referendum - not a single one - with that kind of support for annexation among crimeans , but only minority support for it among the population . 
   low turnout . 
  one of the things in the referendum was the lack of options in the ballot - most notably there was no option to vote for maintaining the status quo . 
  the organizers claimed that * not voting * was a vote for maintaining the status quo but apparently that was never counted as such with the ridiculous claims of some 97 % support for annexation . 
  the low turnout does matter because of the silly way the referendum was organized , and the way it has not been accounted for is just one of the things obviously wrong with the referendum affair . 
  and it is no wonder that the world does not recognize it - excluding 11 countries such as north korea , syria and belarus : [ backing ukraine 's territorial integrity , un assembly declares crimea referendum invalid ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=47443#.u2i8uc4f5_0 ), 
   3 . it states the share of all voters who voted for russia rather than the share of those who actually voted ( which is what matters in a vote ) . 
  so you are saying only casted votes mattered in that referendum . 
  do you happen to remember the options which were limited to only two ? 
  and the notable lack of a no option for the status quo ? 
  and how the organizers and apologists of the referendum claimed that not voting is the no option ? 
  and now you say that not voting should not matter . 
  the whole referendum was silly and indeed the world does not buy it . 
   western media keep saying that putin is 100 % behind everything no , it does n't . 
  perhaps you should ask rt , miha merely provided an observation regarding rt. 
  redditor for one day talking shit ? 
   or [ hertl ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymw4nksg7uq )  [ this is dream ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7zgqgcfsey ) got ta love the [ tmnh ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n9gcpoe.jpg ), 
   they 've been perpetually dicked around by the us since the 90s , just an example would be the fact that they were promised no nato bases east of germany in exchange for allowing it 's unification and entry into nato i would n't call that a ` fact ' as : 1 . 
  nato never made such pledge . 
  there is no evidence of such promise actually ever existing . 
  it is not mentioned in any of the relevant agreements , and never came up in the relevant negotiations - and in fact does not even make sense . 
  additionally , even if someone had insininuated such idea he obviously did not have the authority to do so on the behalf of nato or the sovereign countries willing to join nato . 
  here 's historical research of the recently declassified relevant archives : [ the myth of a no-nato-enlargement pledge to russia ] ( http://dialogueeurope.org/uploads/file/resources/twq%20article%20on%20germany%20and%20nato.pdf ) * `` nato expansion beyond germany never even came up during reuni\ufb01cation negotiations . 
  '' * * `` declassified materials show unmistakably that no such pledge was made . 
  valid arguments can be made against nato enlargement , but this particular argument is spurious . 
  '' * one would expect that believers of such promise could actually show the historical proof of it 's existence but alas there 's none to be found . 
  so , i would call that a myth . 
  and as a historical myth it belongs to the same category with the german post-wwi `` stab-in-the-back '' legend . 
  and , as it happens , there are also some parallers in how those are abused in justifying aggression . 
   and now their entire border is filled with them . 
  no , it most certainly is not . 
   this whole situation came about because the of the eu ultimatum there never was any ` eu ultimatum ' . 
  seems you 're just inventing stuff as you go . 
   for example , [ the eu parliament ] is not allowed to propose any legislation ( it is the only `` parliament '' in the world with this minor defect ) who is this non-insightful blogist anyway ? 
  i propose kittens . 
  small cute kittens that have n't opened their eyes yet . 
  my european dream nation would have teemu sel\u00e4nne at the center , mikael granlund in the left wing , and jarom\u00edr j\u00e1gr in the right wing . 
  defence would be handled by nicklas lidstr\u00f6m and zdeno chara , while tendering would obviously go to tuukka rask . 
  please do n't downvote as i know that combination would be somewhat controversial , and some would say the left wing needs definetely more experience but it 's the future i 'm thinking about . 
  indeed . 
  and for example in finland natural gas is only about 10 % of primary energy consumption . 
  similar maps , tables and numbers have been posted here several times already , and they all have had the same problem . 
  here 's to hoping that someday , someone will post a map which accounts for russian gas ' actual share in energy usage . 
   when a country enters the euro the price increase is faster than the normal rate of inflation did n't happen for example in finland where prices rose according to the inflation , and in fact even the rate of inflation got lower after the introduction of the $ . 
   prices will rise like they did in all countries after the introduction of the euro . 
  did n't happen for example in finland . 
  the prices did rise but only as per the normal inflation : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xajsoee ) [ translation : fig 1 , consumer price index 2000 = 100 and introduction of euro ] with the introduction of $ some prices did rise and some prices did get lower but all in all it was 50/50 : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2intl0 ) [ translation : fig 2 , changes in prices 1/2001 -6 / 2003 percentage of followed prices euroon siirtyminen = introduction of euro laskeneita = lower ( orange ) nousseita = higher ( grey ) ] the problem is that people do not consider statistics or wider samples and are prone to personal confirmation bias . 
  they for example see the price of a coffee cup rise from 5 fim to 1 $ ( = 6 fim ) and conclude that prices have been rising , and then hold on to that view - even against evidence . 
  yup , he made it pretty clear again : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/editorial-on-tasteless-relations-between-gerhard-schroeder-and-putin-a-966718.html, 
   what is the similarity between them ? 
  just for starters : totalitarianist regime . 
   i mean just count how many people were killed by them or something similar sensible stats . 
  yep . 
  looks very bad for both of them . 
   the only similarity is really just conquering some places , yeah , that too . 
  plus deporting/killing people living there , stealing their property and replacing them with certain preferred ethnicity . 
  they both did it . 
   but then again that is something pretty much every king did or tried . 
  i do n't think so . 
  through history some may have tried that but even that would make it an exception . 
  maybe not every russian tsar has done it , but even that needs citation . 
   and usually with far more bloodshed . 
  now this is just silly . 
   go to school . 
  is that some special school ? 
  so , how about gazprom ( i.e. 
  russian state ) share ? 
   they are in every sense nicer in every sense than pretty much any country used to be during almost all of history , except recent decades . 
    seriously , if you just go back 100 years even the most humane nations today did worse things   let alone if you go back to most of history , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 3000 years ... [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ], 
   ad-hominem are always a good way to make an argument more interesting . 
  no ad-hominem has happened there , stop diving and carry on . 
   well thats not much of an explanation on why pretend that its evil incarnate . 
  is that the way you like to conduct discussion ? 
  pretending to be a mind reader and simply inventing opinions for others as you go ? 
  does not work well for you as i never claimed such , nor has ever presented such as an argument . 
  your mind reading abilities failed you , please try to either sharpen them or simply cease to present them as an argument . 
   got your point , but its meh . 
  lets destroy roads to china cause we could at war with them ?
