   we can have pipelines to russia and we can seek independent sources at the same time . 
  their existence does not prevent us from doing so . 
  who 's ` we ' here ? 
   i know it might be shocking to you , but some of dont care for russia , nor russians living in ukraine nor ukraine . 
  we do care for eu and for raw resources and energy needs . 
  well then you 're simply wrong . 
  it is not shocking to me . 
  perhaps your acquired mind reading abilities are not what they advertised . 
   trying to isolate russia , antagonize it , support change of governement in its sphere of influence . 
  its not our business . 
  isolating russia both diplomatically and economically has become an issue in the eu after what russia has done and is doing , because that 's what we - as a community - can do to counter russia 's aggressive policies and actions . 
  btw , russia 's claimed ` sphere of influence ' is very much debatable and it certainly does not exceed sovereign countries to choose their own future nor justify illegally invading and annexing them . 
   i am firmly against war , cold or hot . 
  i would assume others might be as well . 
  good for you . 
   the coup in the ukraine . 
  there has been a ` coup ' in ukraine ? 
  edit : an explanation would be more helpful than a downvote , thank you in advance / u/modulus . 
   eu does not have unified foreign policy and has no authority over austria on this . 
  indeed , the eu parliament does not have authority over austria 's government on this . 
  on foreign policy i disagree to some extent with you , and in this case it certainly seems austria is doing its best not to have such . 
   this decision is also 100 % against interests of eu members . 
  unfortunately the eu parliament very much disagrees with your personal opinion on this , as i do . 
  i do n't see much sense in giving russia 's empire building more strategic influence within the eu . 
  and i think it is indeed in the interests of the eu members to have less russian influence . 
   its a pipeline , do explain how it harms eu members . 
  my god . 
   its a pipeline ** it can be closed if needs be , ** its also trade and more trade means less wars . 
  bolding mine . 
   gazprom is paying for it , theres no reason at all to be against it . 
  the fact that russian state owns it is very much one of the reasons to be very wary about it . 
  who said anything about a war ? 
  countering russia 's efforts of expansion does not equal to a war , nor ` escalating ' . 
   and you think the current plan of escalating the situation by putting sanctions on russia is going to keep peace ? 
  sanctions as a * reaction * is ` escalating the situation ' now ? 
   if you isolate a country you are just going to support it more . 
   if you do n't consider russia your enemy and we will have some proper cultural exchange the culture of russia will adjust . 
  worked great so far , did n't it ? 
   why ? 
  because it is counter to the interests of the european union , after seeing what modern russia has become . 
   what right do they have to make such a call ? 
  every right based on the lisboa treaty etc. 
   i wish . 
  well , do n't you worry . 
  with their current policies russia is and will be coming closer to your border . 
  unless countered that is . 
   oh for fucks sake , look at your comment history !, 
  ffs , please stop . 
  just stop . 
  you 're getting ridiculous . 
   we do n't fuck with anyone 's energy security . 
  others are free to develop their own solutions . 
  yep . 
  looks like that 's exactly what 's happening : austria does n't give a fuck , everybody else has to work it out for them . 
   you know what europe needs ? 
  a good and healthy relationship with russia and not a new cold war . 
  becoming even more energy dependend on russia is not a good basis for a ` good and healthy relationship ' . 
  with that new pipeline bulgaria , serbia , hungary and now austria will be the lynchpins in the eu for russia . 
  do that , expect finlandization - will take you closer to cold war days . 
  it would be helpful if you marked on the map what data it is supposed to represent and what year ( s ) . 
  for example , for finland your source gives for ` gross domestic product , constant prices , percent change ' : 2010\u00a02011\u00a02012\u00a02013 2014 3.363 2.825 -1.008 -1.380 0.350 and i do n't understand where you got -4.8 % for finland and what it is supposed to represent . 
  fsb demands do n't go through a court - they make demands directly without the need of court . 
  fixed , thanks, 
  ah , looks like they have updated the database with new data and now it includes 2012 , try this link : http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a1605/other/a1605_spo09_ts_an_00_2000_00_2012_04_f_en.xls in 2012 there were 508 suicides in greece , up by 31 from previous year . 
  that makes the rate about 4.5 which is among the lowest in the eu , where the average rate is about 11.8 ( 2010 ) - [ data ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00122 ) . 
   that 's exactly what they say , and nobody believes them . 
  great arguments you have . 
   you do n't have data from the last 3 years . 
  neither does the article . 
   even countries that almost completely digitized their administrative , like estonia have sources from 2010 . 
  and hellenic statistic authority has data available to year 2011 . 
  just like the article . 
   you 're not doing that again . 
  an internet serb with a mission , i see . 
   you 're like holocaust denier . 
  umm ... no . 
  i only presented some relevant data . 
  edit : hellenic statistical authority has updated the data with 2012 numbers , fixed the link accordingly . 
  will add it to graph later . 
  hellenic statistical authority - [ deaths in greece 2000-12 by age and cause ] ( http://http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a1605/other/a1605_spo09_ts_an_00_2000_00_2012_04_f_en.xls ) . 
  number of suicides in greece 2000-11 : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8653scm ) years 2009 and 2010 look pretty average without excess suicides . 
  in fact there was more suicides in 2005-6 . 
  but there seems to be a spike in 2011 as compared to preceding decade average . 
  and with the new data : in 2012 there were 508 suicides in greece , up by 31 from previous year . 
  that makes the 2012 suicide rate about 4.5 - still among the lowest in the eu , where the [ average rate is about 11.8 ( 2010 ) ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00122 ) . 
  there are two consecutive years with higher than average suicide numbers in greece , but they 're certainly not the years 2009-10 the article discusses but in fact 2011-12 . 
   you 'll notice i responded to the assertion that china would n't buy russian oil , well , i never said china would n't buy russian oil . 
  that would be quite nonsensical to claim as i already posted a graph showing that china indeed does buy russian oil ( 9 % of imports ) . 
  i 'm sorry if my statement was unclear , what i ment was that china would never go for it - the ` it ' being russia replacing eu market with china . 
   this means it would be forced to undercut its own current prices and the prices of rival exporters . 
  yep , and that in turn * could * have its effect in the world market prices . 
  i think in case of the eu switching away from russian oil there would be numerous different price pressures , and some of them might be contradictory . 
  there 's nothing overtly simplistic in saying that russia can not replace the eu market with china . 
  i am not saying that china would not buy russian oil at all . 
  but as it will not import russian oil in similar volumes as the eu does , the idea of russia simply replacing the eu market with china wo n't happen . 
  china 's oil imports are estimated as about about 6.6 million bbl/d this year , and the imported volume has been on a growing trend . 
  china and russia have deals for russia to export to china close to 1 million bbl/d of crude oil by 2020 through various routes . 
  to replace the eu market demand russia would have to export at least 4 million bbl/d in addition to that . 
  wo n't happen because : 1 . 
  you 'll need to invest into additional infrastucture to import that much .
