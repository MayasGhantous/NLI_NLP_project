  china 's strategy is to hedge their bets and to have a heterogenous energy supply . 
  it is their long term strategic choise . 
  they would not suddenly start buying 75 % of their oil imports from russia and risk becoming dependend on it . 
  and the same goes for natural gas . 
   because gas contracts are signed on a country-by-country basis in russia , and in that contract is a clause that means you ca n't resell russian gas . 
  there is an ongoing antitrust case regarding those : [ antitrust : commission opens proceedings against gazprom ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-937_en.htm?locale=fr ) in addition to probably illegal resale clauses it also covers monopolistic pricing behavior and clauses restricting gas flows . 
   '' 551 men killed themselves ` solely because of fiscal austerity '' ' . 
  which is nonsense when you look at the number of suicides . 
  as compared to preceding decade there is * no excess of suicides in 2009-10 * . 
  so , if we assume their claim to be true , why did comparable amount of people kill themselves in previous years ? 
  and why was there more suicides in 2005-6 ? 
  i do n't think anyones forcing people to commit suicides . 
  and while greece 's suicide rates are very low even with the 2011 spike , i do think greek government probably should invest more to preventive actions . 
  editorialized headline . 
  i do n't think mass suicide means what op thinks it means . 
  anyway :  after controlling for other characteristics that might lead to suicide , 551 men killed themselves `` solely because of fiscal austerity '' between 2009 and 2010 , said the paper 's co-author nikolaos antonakakis . 
  umm ... [ no ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8653scm ) and that 's all suicides including women . 
  to me 2009 and 2010 look pretty average within the variation , and there seems to be a spike in 2011 as compared to previous decade 's average . 
  data : hellenic statistical authority - [ deaths in greece 2000-11 by age and cause ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a1605/other/a1605_spo09_ts_an_00_2000_00_2011_04_f_en.xls ) . 
  and that ` more ' part is only a fraction of what russia 's biggest market the eu imports . 
  russia simply can not replace the eu market with china , the volume just is n't there and china would never go for it anyway . 
   this would be pointless because russia will sell it to china instead . 
  china would buy only a fraction of russia 's oil and gas compared to what the eu currently imports . 
  china is a big oil importer but likes to hedge its bets by importing from different suppliers , and would not make the strategic blunder of becoming energy dependent on russia .

   how does one extract coal from the ground in a sustainable way ? 
  not sure but i think he refers to ghg emissions with the ` sustainable ' . 
  in that sense it is in fact possible to both use coal and still meet the kyoto reduction targets because there are many ways to reduce the ghg emissions . 
  yet using coal makes cutting ghg emissions more challenging and it has to go at some point in the future to get further reductions for future targets ( 2030-50 ) - depending on the country , of course .

  breakdown of the latest survey : [ southeast statistics - a report on kiis polling data from april 8-16 , 2014 ] ( http://ukrainianpolicy.com/southeast-statistics-of-ukraine-april-2014/ ), 
  ah , so i should not disagree with you or your arguments based on hyperboles and counterfactuals . 
  and if i do , it 's only because i 'm `` butthurt '' as per your concept of conducting civil discussion . 
  got it . 
  fyi : i still do not agree with you . 
  i very much disagree with your suggestion to stifle discussion by unwarranted moderator action which deprives / r/europe from having a choise on what it sees as relevant . 
  and your arguments with hyperboles , patently incorrect claims , and self-contradictions have not convinced me otherwise . 
  it is not because i 'm `` butthurt '' , as you so kindly put it , it is because your arguments are very poorly constructed exaggaretions and even blatantly false . 
  just for one example , you say :  ( nobody cares that you 're posting the 10th poll about ukrainians not wanting to join russia ) then please explain how is it possible that [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23i653/poll_most_in_east_ukraine_region_against_joining/ ) about such survey gained 133 upvotes and 67 comments . 
  to me it certainly looks like that people do find it interesting and worthy of discussing , and your claim ` nobody cares ' is patently false . 
   what else would you call it ? 
  i 'm calling for you to keep the discussion civil . 
   you 're complaining in fact it is you complaining here ( re : your op ) . 
  and i happen to disagree with your arguments based on hyperboles and counterfactuals . 
  you do know the results are in line with other related surveys conducted by different organisations ? 
   all of which have been repeatedly covered . 
  there is such a thing as finite discussion potential . 
  it 's been done . 
  i find it quite non-sensical to claim that all there is to discuss has already been discussed about an * ongoing crisis * which is constantly developing with high probability of escalating further , with wide ranging repercussions on our continent . 
   if ** you 're so butthurt ** about it go post in the megathread and create a discussion , because all the trivial news items will be posted there in the comments , just reply to them like a normal thread . 
  how about keeping it civil , eh ? 
   yes , exactly . 
  the whole point was that i was using your logic to justify my argument . 
  it does n't hold up at all . 
  great , you get to keep the cake and eat it too , then . 
   there 's nothing hyperbolic about my arguments in the slightest . 
  * ahem * , these are your arguments :  too bad . 
  we 've had 6 weeks of `` in depth '' discussion , all of which amount to the same thing being said over and over again . 
  it 's a well that 's gone dry . 
   they have the same discussion over and over again . 
   i , and many other people , are sick to death of seeing nothing except ukraine . 
   ( nobody cares that you 're posting the 10th poll about ukrainians not wanting to join russia )  but there 's nothing relevant being posted about it anymore ,  i wonder which of the 100 threads that have been posted about ukraine have spoken about how this is shaking the foundations of peace and democracy and how unprepared europe is for what 's about to come ? 
  probably all of them . 
  if those are not hyperboles i do n't know what is . 
   oh , an argument i 've seen before . 
  i wonder which of the 100 threads that have been posted about ukraine have spoken about how this is shaking the foundations of peace and democracy and how unprepared europe is for what 's about to come ? 
  probably all of them . 
  in case that is an actual question : posts and discussions with wide range of topics related to ukraine crisis . 
  they have varied from geopolitics to security , from energy policies to economics , and from history to opinion surveys . 
  your loaded question implies they have all been about the same , which is patently incorrect . 
   again , not how reddit works . 
  reddit works how the moderators of the particular subreddit want it to work . 
  that is how it is . 
  your argument goes fundamentally against the concept of a subreddit in the first place , and against the concept of forum moderatorship , and against the concept of quality control . 
  relying on upvotes for quality control caters to the lowest common denominator i.e. 
  the least invested people in the subreddit . 
   if the readers of / r/europe are so adamantly against this then my post would n't have gotten to the front page , and if the moderators did n't agree then there would n't be a megathread right now . 
  you just claimed that upvoting posts is not how reddit works or is even supposed to work . 
  now you claim upvoting fundamentally supports you and according to your argument it 's `` the lowest common denominator i.e. 
  the least invested people in the subreddit '' . 
  as i already said : i very much disagree with your suggestion to stifle discussion by unwarranted moderator action which deprives / r/europe from having a choise on what is sees as relevant . 
  your arguments with hyperboles , patently incorrect claims , and self-contradictions have not convinced me otherwise . 
   too bad . 
  we 've bad 3 months of `` in depth '' discussion , all of which amount to the same thing being said over and over again . 
  it 's a well that 's gone dry . 
  a lot of events have taken place within last three months , events that have shaken the very security structures built in europe after wwii . 
  we are looking at history in the making , which should be very relevant to our continent and the economic and political structures on it for decades to come , and you claim it 's a well gone dry . 
   not how reddit works . 
  if that was the case then moderators are obsolete . 
  upvoting posts is exactly how reddit works . 
  posts about ukraine get to the front page * because people see them as relevant * , and people have discussions about those posts - just as it should be . 
  what you 're calling for is moderators to prevent it from working , to prevent the readers of / r/europe from deciding what they see as interesting and relevant in this sub . 
  and afaik those posts have not broken / r/europe rules which would require moderator action . 
   they have the same discussion over and over again . 
  not that i have seen . 
  the posts and discussions have ranged a lot covering variety of very relevant topics from security and geopolitics to economics and energy markets to opinion surveys . 
   i , and many other people , are sick to death of seeing nothing except ukraine .
