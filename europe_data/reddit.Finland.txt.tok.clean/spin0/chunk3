  [ question  ( http://www.pewglobal.org/question-search/?qid=843&amp;cntids=@49-&amp;stdids= ) please tell me if you have a very favorable , somewhat favorable , somewhat unfavorable , or very unfavorable opinion of ... the european union year | very favorable | somewhat favorable | somewhat unfavorable | very unfavorable | dk/refused -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 2004 | 22 | 36 | 15 | 20 | 7 2007 | 5 | 22 | 14 | 44 | 14 2009 | 4 | 18 | 9 | 50 | 20 2010 | 4 | 24 | 12 | 45 | 14 2011 | 5 | 18 | 19 | 45 | 14 2012 | 5 | 16 | 14 | 46 | 19 2013 | 4 | 22 | 23 | 37 | 15 what 's up with that huge jump between 2004 and 2007 ? 
   and from where the fuck are we supposed to get the gas ? 
  not a short term solution , i know , but why not further develop the resources serbia has ? 
  serbia has natural gas fields :  serbia holds 40 bcm of natural gas reserves , or approximately 0.02 % of the world total reserves . 
  but so far the production has been small :  in 2010 , serbia produced 263 mcm of natural gas the same amount than in the previous year . 
  source : http://www.energydelta.org/mainmenu/energy-knowledge/country-gas-profiles/serbia/addcomment#t57877 to cope with short term gas shortages [ serbia has the banatski dvor storage ] ( http://www.gie.eu/download/maps/2014/gse_stor_map_july2014.pdf ) with 450 mcm capacity , [ reportedly full in august ] ( https://powermarket.seenews.com/news/serbias-banatski-dvor-underground-gas-storage-full-to-capacity-433799 ) , and in september made [ an agreement with hungary ] ( https://powermarket.seenews.com/news/serbian-energy-min-says-gas-storage-space-in-hungary-secured-media-439010 ) to utilize storage capacity over there . 
  yeah , i apologize for the bad joke as that 's absolutely not warranted and there 's absolutely no reason for anyone to be worried about toxins in food products . 
  and as the article clearly states especially italian food products are particularly safe in that regard . 
  joking aside , you have an italian flare so i assume you 're italian . 
  can i ask you something ? 
  mr. berlusconi made it his personal mission to grab an agency which had already agreed to be established in finland . 
  why do you italians believe it was so important for mr.berlusconi to make his personal mission to grab that particular agency ? 
  now that the european food safety authority actually is in italy it has become an inefficient expensive disgrace and we all eu citizens pay for it with our taxes . 
  what are the current plans to make the agency more efficient and less costly to the eu taxpayers ? 
  for example :  as the european parliament 's budgetary control committee has pointed out , each meeting of the management board of the european food safety authority ( efsa ) -- whose work already overlaps with another eu agency and whose board only consists of 15 people -- costs on average $ 92,630 ( ** $ 6,175 per member ** ) , nearly three times higher than that of second most expensive decentralised agency . 
  ( source : [ the rise of the eu quangos ] ( http://www.openeurope.org.uk/content/documents/pdfs/riseoftheeuquangos2012.pdf ) ) also that particular agency seems to be completely unable to finance itself at all ( how do i fund ? ), 
  as full 100 % of its funding is from the pockets of eu taxpayers :  european food safety agency ( efsa ) budget for 2012 : $ 78.1 m eu/member states contribution : $ 78.1 m which means the eu taxpayers are paying 100 % of those most expensive triple cost board meetings taking place in palermo , italy - on average giving $ 6,175 to a board member who bothers to show up in there . 
  the lax spending by the agency was deep enough of concern for the european parliament to actually * suspend * the 2010 budgetary discharge for the agency . 
  now , * that * takes a lot . 
   i think it also has to do with being independent , norway is much more local than the us . 
  it has more to do with actual supply . 
  not everyone produces lng but the market is rapidly changing and soon also the us will be one of the suppliers . 
  the more suppliers the less dependency on a single one . 
   umm . . what ? 
  ah , was just joking : [ the home of olive oil and mozzarella is still the mafia 's toxic waste land ] ( http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-home-of-olive-oil-and-mozzarella-is-still-the-mafias-toxic-waste-land ), 
   apart from the berlusconi thing , did some italian participate in the contest ? 
  by italian dont mean italian-american . 
  also , where was the contest held ? 
  it 's a living joke on berlusconi policies . 
  when finland negotiated for a eu membership in the 90s we were promised to have the [ european food safety authority ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_food_safety_authority ) . 
  then enter berlusconi . 
  for some reason he suddenly was vehemently opposed to the idea of finland having the authority on food safety . 
  probably because we should all know how safe italian food is - it 's not like hundreds dying because of poisonous oil or high amounts of enviromental toxins bear any relevance here . 
  anyway , everyone was baffled when he out of the blue started his sudden campaign against finland having that particular agency . 
  he went on to a personal crusade about it . 
  he was mostly taken as the clown he was , but in his personal crusade that clown used insults in need of an answer . 
  hence the victorious pizza berlusconi . 
  thanks to him the european food safety authority is now located in parma , italy . 
  it has become one of the most costly and least efficient agencies in the eu continuously tapping to the eu budget . 
  even a single meeting of the board costs ridiculous amounts . 
  and all eu taxpayers pay for that . 
  meanwhile the european chemicals agency that was given to finland does not need much eu budget support . 
  the agency has become efficient enough to actually fund itself not tapping into pockets of eu taxpayers while providing its services to all of them . 
  we still do n't know why it was suddenly so important for berlusconi to do everything he could to prevent finland from having the european food safety authority . 
  maybe history will tell us some day . 
  and if the european food safety authority hailing from parma tells me an italian produce is perfectly safe to eat , i tend to avoid that product recommended by those croocks . 
  but pizza berlusconi will live on even after no amount of viagra manages to give berlusconi a hard on . 
  the day he rots in grave i 'll have reindeer pizza just for the living joke . 
  and as the lazy bastards tend to spend their summer holidays lying on the asphalt you do n't even need a gun, 
   that was n't science . 
  it actually was science of the time , and it had long tradition too . 
  and as a proponent of scientocracy that should be no surprise to you as it is a well researched area of history and history of science . 
  but your denial of it is alarming , apparently you 're not a scientist - not willing to deal with truth but rather deny it . 
  we all know science is faulty and prone to error . 
  all human endeavor is . 
  basically your ideal of scientocracy is just as attainable and desirable as the creation of ` homo sovieticus ' was . 
  you even pepper it with active denial of known errors . 
  we do not need it , and we do not want it . 
  take a good look at the past century and its errors killing millions . 
  i think jacob bronowsky puts it best here , please take your time to watch it : [ bbc ascent of man - 11 - knowledge or certainty ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ohne_bbc-ascent-of-man-11-knowledge-or-certainty_tv ) he puts it very well :  it 's said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers . 
  that 's false , tragically false . 
  look for yourself . 
  this is the concentration camp and crematorium at auschwitz . 
  this is where people were turned into numbers . 
  into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people . 
  and that was not done by gas . 
  it was done by arrogance , it was done by dogma , it was done by ignorance . 
  when people believe that they have absolute knowledge , with no test in reality , this is how they behave . 
  this is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods . 
   science is a very human form of knowledge . 
  we are always at the brink of the known ; we always feel forward for what is to be hoped . 
  every judgment in science stands on the edge of error and is personal . 
  science is a tribute to what we can know although we are fallible . 
  in the end , the words were said by oliver cromwell : `` i beseech you in the bowels of christ : think it possible you may be mistaken . '', 
   i owe it as a scientist to my friend leo szilard , i owe it as a human being to the many members of my family who died here , to stand here as a survivor and a witness . 
  we have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power . 
  we have to close the distance between the push-button order and the human act . 
  we have to touch people . 
   they do n't even sell it here . . 
  damn santa 's marketing department with their 11 month sabbatical leaves . 
   do you eat santa 's animals !? 
  we loooove them animals . 
  now who would n't : cute , useful and tasty . 
  also the new , improved reindeer is just as tasty and now [ menaces with spikes of glowing antlers .

  indeed . 
  regarding energy imports it is china 's long term strategy to hedge its bets and to keep the suppliers of energy heterogenic never becoming dependent on a single one . 
  also many tend to forget that china itself is a significant oil and gas producer . 
   what i support is a form of scientocracy . 
  did n't you guys already try it ? 
  you know when the science supported the concepts of racial hygiene and such nonsense . 
   vice was actually there during the battle . 
  on the place where the ambush happened ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if you have vice footage of it please do present . 
  besides , it is possible there was an traffic accident . 
  and it is also possible that vice covered that , albeit i do n't think so . 
  but that does not in any way exclude the ambush as a separate incident , as you seem to imply . 
  also a winning pizza served as hot revenge from finland : [ reindeer pizza named after berlusconi ] ( http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2008/06_giugno/12/finland_pizza_berlusconi.shtml ),
