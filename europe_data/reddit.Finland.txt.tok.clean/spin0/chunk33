  poor companies , so sad no-one told them that investing to russia may have risks . 
   millions of people from the countryside and the small cities will move to western european countries to work on low-level jobs . 
  people leaving the countryside and small towns for jobs either in cities or other countries has happened all over the world and also in european countries at different times . 
  here in finland it happened quite late compared to other industrialized countries and in the 60s and 70s hundreds of thousands were leaving the countryside for industrial jobs in sweden . 
  by leaving they got better wages and better standard of living in sweden as they could have in finland . 
  in post-soviet countries it is happening later . 
  and there 's also another important aspect to it : the soviet collectivized agriculture was labour heavy . 
  as the agriculture gets modernized it can produce more with less labour , and there is less demand for low-skilled labour in the countryside . 
  for them the choises are either education for new qualifications or to continue to work in low-skill jobs . 
  it just so happens that even the low-skill jobs pay comparatively well in the west , and it is a lucrative way to improve one 's standard of living instead of for example getting new qualifications and moving to city . 
  it has both negative and positive impacts , but i can not see it as such a tragedy as some like portray it . 
  what you gon na do about it anyway ? 
  introduce internal passports to prevent people from leaving their village and force them live in it in misery ? 
   however , even if they joined the european union , it 's unlikely the average ukrainian will get the european living standards this century . 
  wow , not for 86 years you say . 
  sounds a bit bold prophecy if you ask me . 
   for more details , ask the bottom half of the romanian employees , who earn less than 200 $ / month . 
  how about cheking also [ other countries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/np53wac.jpg ) . 
  then analysing a bit what you have gathered , and possibly seeing what to do to best foster growth . 
  i mean , even reaching romania would be a big improvement . 
  you can easily study in english . 
  but finding work in finland after that will be challenge if you have n't learned any finnish - but that depends a bit . 
  for example , especially in the ict sector there are companies that work in english and do not require finnish skills . 
  additionally , as i presume you have language skills in ukrainian , russian and english they may be strong points in your resume for some companies working in the relevant regions . 
  in general you 'll need finnish skills and not having it will make finding a job harder . 
  but it is not always absolutely necessary . 
  yeah , i did n't expect either . 
  i actually believed putin when he said that he will not invade ukraine , and then that he will not annex crimea . 
  despite him lying about pretty much everything else i honestly believed him on those two points because invading and annexing just did not make sense - and honestly still does n't . 
  will bite him into ass hard later on . 
   i do n't share the values of us government well , then you do n't . 
  look , i find following two arguments regarding finland 's nato membership pretty silly : 1 ) whether russia is or is not about to annex finland . 
  2 ) something something us . 
  neither of them has never convinced me to support nato membership , and neither will convince me out of it either . 
   we are in eu , indeed . 
  finland is not neutral any more , and staying militarily non-aligned looks a bit contradictory to me . 
   we do n't need to be in some military alliance to show that we share democratic values . 
  and yet you said that you would support finland joining a military alliance . 
  the big difference is that while you 'd support finland joining an alliance that exists only in imagination , i support finland joining an actually existing defence alliance . 
  social democrats was important in the containment policy towards communists who got their funding from kremlin . 
  us funding had nothing to do with a nato membership , which would have been impossible due to treaties anyway ( paris peace treaties , yya ) . 
   finland should n't join . 
  russia has no reason to annex finland i have been on the fence on nato membership for a very long time . 
  now i support it . 
  the potential of a russian annexation has not played part in it , and i find that somewhat lacking as an argument in the first place - both for , and against nato membership . 
  i support nato membership because finland is not a neutral country , have n't been for decades , and it is silly to try turn clock back to times of finlandization by longing after pretended neutrality . 
  as a western democracy and as a member of the eu finland is clearly aligned with the west sharing its values . 
   i would prefer military union with other nordic countries . 
  there will be no military union with other nordics . 
  iceland , denmark and norway are all already in nato , and they 're not about to leave it . 
  that leaves potentially only sweden . 
  there 's no plans or initiatives for a military alliance between sweden and finland . 
  there are only some plans for military co-operation , but that is far from a defensive alliance . 
  and as alliances go it would make much more sense to simply join nato as 1 ) it actually exists and 2 ) has actual military power as compared to any imaginable nordic alliance . 
  and just when you 'd think russian propaganda could n't get any more ridiculous they take it to new hilarious levels : [ 27 sailors resign from the uss donald cook - the american destroyer stationed in the black sea ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsevastopol.su%2fworld.php%3fid%3d60334 ) * the pentagon acknowledged that imitation su-24 attack on the u.s. navy destroyer produced a demoralizing effect on the crew * btw , for added fun check the domain name .

  if you like you can verify the crashing misex in any economy tracking site such as [ yahoo ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=micexindexcf.me&amp;t=5d&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c= ) .

  in finland : http://www.studyinfinland.fi/tuition_and_scholarships/tuition_fees  the tuition fee trial period in finland 2010-2014 is drawing towards its close ( see subsection ` tuition fee trial period 2010-2014 ' for more information on this ) . 
   this means that there are no tuition fees charged in finnish higher education degrees starting in autumn 2014 , regardless of the level of studies and the nationality of the student . 
   but please note that this does not completely rule out the possibility that the situation might change at some point in the future . 
  check also [ aalto university ] ( http://www.aalto.fi/en/studies/about/for_future_student/financing/ ) in helsinki , and you might try doing relevant searches in / r/finland as the sub has many questions regarding studying in finland with accurate answers . 
  there 's also ukrainian community in finland and you might find their associations in the web ( e.g.

  the osce has an observation mission in the region . 
  i do n't know what they have reported . 
  many thanks to you both . 
  in the 90s i used to work on harju street right opposite the park in # 50 , # 51 and # 52 . 
  in fact the park was where i first learned about the march bombing . 
   the fact that the us has it 's mercs there . 
  i 've seen only rumours and unsusbtantiated kremlin claims , would approach with a big grain of salt . 
  thanks to you both . 
  fixed the link . 
  another striking detail is that both guys have a rifle * and * a pistol ( see the holster on his right thigh ) . 
  i do n't know why ` concerned citizens ' would so consistently wield them both . 
  does not mean it 's the same guy in both images , but points to russian spec ops . 
  having both rifle and pistol is standard issue of russian spec ops . 
  they 're trained to wielding them both as their doctrine is that a soldier must never be unarmed or with an unloaded gun . 
  they 're also trained to switch between them on the fly depending on the situation . 
  check this training video of russian spec ops guy switching between his rifle and pistol : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1fy8lblblq&amp;t=1m42s we have seen it before in crimea with russian troops , and now we 're seeing it in eastern ukraine . 
  here 's a ` concerned citizen ' in eastern ukraine today making a convincing point with [ his pistol ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/blfvrdeigae-we6.jpg ), 
   i 'm personally hoping for a eu military in the future since i can see sweden and finland joining that . 
  the de facto defence alliance in the eu is nato . 
  in the 90s there was some attempts of forming another eu defence alliance based on weu or such ( and i do n't mean military co-operation in general , but defence alliance ) . 
  but it became obvious how redundant that would be . 
  if you 're still hoping for one , you 'll probably have to wait a long time . 
  speaking of historical images , does anyone have links to images of tallinn before the soviet [ march bombing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tallinn_in_world_war_ii ) and after ? 
   bb guns do n't kill 16 police mens in body armor with helmets and stuff indeed . 
  and as the protesters did n't have sniper rifles and aks it rises some questions , do n't you think ? 
   there is other footage with a guy with curly hair who shoots at someone before any slaughter of civilians taking place . 
  yeah , i 'm sure that settles it then . 
  by the authority of youtube it was ' a guy with curly hair ' . 
   again , `` old ladies '' are a part of propaganda campaign conducted by russian oriented side to present themselves as defenders of oppressed . 
  maidan activists used pr shit and media campaigns as well , yet no one accused them of being `` brave , brave , brave '' . 
  putin using civilians as human shields is what he 's rationalising . 
  he 's a very brave man . 
   unlike western `` interventions '' that strive only to bring freedom and prosperity to the world . 
  did n't know of whataboutism in sweden . 
  thanks for demonstrating .
