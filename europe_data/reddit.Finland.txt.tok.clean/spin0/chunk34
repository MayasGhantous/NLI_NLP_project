  indeed . 
  putin 's revisionism is very misplaced as both the soviet union and russia did already let go decades ago . 
  when ukraine - after a referendum - became independend from the soviet union dec 1991 , russia was among the very first countries to recognise ukraine 's independence . 
  and they further pledged to honor it and ukraine 's territorial integrity in the budapest memorandun . 
  putin has demonstrated what their signature is worth . 
   i remember videos of people with sniper rifles , i remember people with aks in hotel of ukraine ( i do n't remember the name exactly ) . 
  and you have seen bb guns , which russian propaganda presented as `` sniper rifles '' and `` aks '' . 
  i mean , everyone without wooden eyes laughed . 
   russian speaker and can not understand intonations or what is truly meant behind his words . 
  it is basically a disguised threat that : `` if someone were to attack a civilian population , there would be a hell to pay '' . 
  yeah , and it 's very brave to make such threats when russian troops are hiding behind old ladies and using them as human shields as they did in crimea . 
  \u266a * brave , brave , brave , brave sir putin . 
  you 're probably right - perhaps it 's not the end of the country . 
  it 's just an end of an era . 
  and when i say an end of an era i mean the end of the world . 
  fun fact : teemu has been a named player in ea nhl games since the [ stoneage ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/nhl_hockey_screenshot.png ) today it 's teemu 's last regular season game and hockey fans have pledged to honour it with a standing ovation when he 's on the ice . 
  and i do n't think it 's just ducks fans but also avalanche fans will join to honor one of the hockey greats . 
  many onions will be cut today . 
  yup , that sort of shit has been going on in russia with pogroms and all . 
  relevant article : [ xenophobia in russia at an all-time high , experts say ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/xenophobia-in-russia-at-an-all-time-high-experts-say/ ) earlier thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/217yty/xenophobia_in_russia_at_an_alltime_high_experts/ and now there has been about 1500 refugees from crimea since the russian occupation . 
   i most stress that i am generalising wildly here yes , he is . 
  and the actually relevant part is hidden into the very last sentence :  furthermore , ** there is a lot more ** to the finnish story rather than just nokia ( for example the server problems in the paper and pulp industry ) . 
  indeed . 
  and instead of going on about his version of nokia story the * ' a lot more ' * part is where he should have been looking at in the first place . 
  there 's a lot of wasted words between those two quotes . 
   but lets rewind a couple of months back , do you remember pictures from euromaidan with some chick who proposed to marry a guy , who would switch loyalty to `` the people '' and other pictures of older womans , teachers etc who stood in front of berkut and internal forces with all sorts of signs and slogans ? 
  do you remember heavily armed military guys in uniforms hiding behind old ladies on maidan ? 
  me neither . 
  and here 's putin 's rationale for russian troops using civilians as human shields : [ putin will be using ukrainian women and children as shield for russian troops ] ( http://youtu.be/6h9cm8h4xzm )  vladimir putin : listen carefully . 
  i want you to understand me clearly : if we make that decision , it will only be to protect ukrainian citizens . 
  and ** let 's see those troops try to shoot their own people , with us behind them -- not in the front , but behind . 
  let them just try to shoot at women and children !, 
  ** i would like to see those who would give that order in ukraine . 
  ( interview from weeks ago when russian troops used civilians as human shields in crimea ) \u266a * brave , brave , brave , brave sir putin . 
  yeah , i read that too . 
  but he is just in one spot . 
  nothing happening over there does not mean nothing happening elsewhere . 
  2040 : 50 % of russians on the moon votes for annexation . 
  other 50 % voted for independence but had an unfortunate oxygen malfunction so annexation it is . 
  my country was invented by our national hero jean sibelius in a sauna in 1952 . 
  the country will likely come to its end by this nhl season with the last game of teemu sel\u00e4nne . 
  [ 't was a good run ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxq8nazofk1qgy6vpo1_500.gif ), 
  relevant very interesting report : [ the russian connection - the spread of pro-russian policies on the european far right ] ( http://www.riskandforecast.com/useruploads/files/pc_flash_report_russian_connection.pdf ), 
  yep , russia looks like ` too far gone ' as they 'd say in the walking dead . 
  there 's no bouncing back for russia . 
  the putin regime has burned many bridges and many more will burn . 
  too bad for russians . 
  interesting point of strategic relevance :  in fact , both slaviansk and kramatorsk are in between kharkiv and donetsk ( [ map ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/slov ) ) . 
  if pro-russian gunmen controlled lugansk , donetsk , kramatorsk , and slaviansk , then they could have control of all the key roads in eastern ukraine . 
  with russian troops in crimea , and a massive russian force just north of kharkiv , if one wanted to establish pro-russian militias inside ukraine in order to soften the ground for an invasion with the rest of russia 's military , this is exactly what it would look like . 
  furthermore , this is exactly how pro-russian militias established control over crimea . 
  there was a [ significant body of evidence ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/yes-russia-controls-crimea-and-yes-those-really-are-russian-troops/ ) suggesting that those pro-russian militias were actually russian special forces . 
  now there 's a growing body of evidence that these militias are too . 
  yep , capturing and controlling key spots certainly appears to be preparation for russian invasion . 
  there 's little evidence that these gunmen enjoy much popular support , separatism gains only marginal support in polls ( e.g. 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22loex/recent_26_29_march_opinion_poll_of_people_of/ ) ) and large [ genuine pro-ukraine protests are growing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/izweoqn ) . 
  also looks like russia with its gunmen is aiming to capture as many key locations and cities as they can before the crucial meeting in geneve next thursday . 
  then they might claim how the ukrainian government does not have control over the situation , people need putin 's ` protection ' , and ukraina is not supported by the local population . 
  or he deleted them himself after they got downvoted . 
   as well as the gun on the holster . 
  having both rifle and pistol is standard issue of russian spec ops . 
  they 're trained to wielding them both as their doctrine is that a soldier must never be unarmed or with an unloaded gun . 
  training video of russian spec ops guy switching between his rifle and pistol : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1fy8...utu.be&amp;t=1m42s, 
  apparently so , or at least that 's what putin told the world the last time he invaded . 
  and we all believe him , do n't we ? 
  russian soldier in crimea and peaceful protester in east ukraine - [ spot the difference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m23gbm6.png ), 
   50 % of the top ten are anti-russian . 
  being critical of russian government , its actions and policies is not the same as being anti-russian . 
  and no , i have n't seen any ` anti-russian astroturfing ' here . 
  the few anti-russian comments i have seen were rightly downvoted to oblivion and then deleted , for example [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22otap/link_in_polish_russia_has_been_kicked_out_from/cgp1z4h ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22rpxl/have_you_noticed_prorussian_astroturfing_in/cgpqh94 ) . 
  * hmm ... a post about russia . 
  what should i do ? 
  what would putin do ? ... 
  i know , i know !, 
  instead of dicussing russia 's economy , i 'll turn it into a discussion about eu . 
  cut from whom ? 
  ukraine halted buying gas from russia already days ago as the price dispute is not settled . 
  and in his boasting putin fails to mention that his claimed economic help to ukraine was in fact agreed upon ** rent ** for naval base . 
  and that is was putin himself who blatantly broke and then nullified that treaty . 
  and now he seems to treat that rent as some sort of aid russia has generously admitted to ukraine . 
  a very good lesson to learn for any country : whatever you do , do not accept russian military bases on your soil . 
  so someone saying someone else has to do something that was being done anyway is news now ? 
   when we applied for eu the nato membership was like a conjoined twin that we had to accept as well . 
  eu membership does not require nato membership , and vice versa . 
  we have eu members not in nato , and nato members not in eu . 
  if your country applied to both at the same time it 's your country 's decision . 
   as far as i understand : only security council can declare an illegal declarations of independence . 
  no , it does n't say that only security council can . 
   also it follows with : and nothing in that says russia 's invasion , occupation and annexation of crimea did not violate international law . 
   have you noticed tons of anti-russian comments which are heavily voted up no i have n't . 
  but i have seen anti-russian comments downvoted to oblivion and rightly so . 
  itt : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22rpxl/have_you_noticed_prorussian_astroturfing_in/cgpqh94 another example from yesterday : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22otap/link_in_polish_russia_has_been_kicked_out_from/cgp1z4h it 's also relevant to note that criticising russian government , its actions and policies is not the same as being anti-russian . 
  listen , we do know that russia 's military buildup has been been happening in existing bases . 
  and also elsewhere on the field . 
  one does not exclude the other , and both has been observed . 
   the site is down here 's the relevant part :  russian claims that the annexation of crimea was justifed by the opinion of the international court of justice on the independence of kosovo  russian leaders claim that the precedent for the so-called declaration of independence of crimea was the advisory opinion of the international court of justice on the independence of kosovo ( online here ) . 
   however , the court stated clearly that their opinion was not a precedent . 
  the court said they had been given a `` narrow and specific '' question about kosovo 's independence which would not cover the broader legal consequences of that decision . 
   the court highlighted circumstances in which claims for independence would be illegal . 
  this would include if * `` they were , or would have been , connected with the unlawful use of force '' * .
