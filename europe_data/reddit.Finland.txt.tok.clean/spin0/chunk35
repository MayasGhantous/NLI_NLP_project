  an example of `` an unlawful use of force '' would be an invasion and occupation by a neighbouring country -- which is exactly what russia has done . 
   furthermore , the process leading to kosovo 's declaration of independence spanned years and included an extensive process led by the united nations . 
  russian claims ignore all of these facts . 
  so no , the icj opinion on kosovo does not justify russia 's invasion , occupation and annexation of crimea . 
  obviously not just in bases : [ in pictures : russian military build-up near ukraine ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26968312 ) for example this area with russian military buildup is certainly not a military base : [ image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lzdpkvs ), 
   ukraine now demands slovakia to push gas through 2 of the pipes to opposite direction - back to ukraine . 
  slovakia and ukraine already have an earlier related agreement about the reverse flow , so i 'm not sure if ` demands ' is the best choise of words here . 
   it requires some special technology ( sorry i have no idea ) yes , currently slovakia can not do reverse flow to ukraine - needs some additional infrastructure first , such as metering stations and pipes . 
  it would not be a huge effort to build those but the need exists , and getting those in place has it 's own complications including gazprom . 
  there 's also contractual issue : gazprom claims its contract with slovakia prohibits the country from doing reverse flows . 
  the eu has raised questions about the legality of such contractual clausules restricting gas flows , an investigation and legal case has been in the works since 2012 : [ antitrust : commission opens proceedings against gazprom ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-937_en.htm?locale=fr )  that means , we would have loss 50 % of these money a year while pushing the gas back to ukraine . 
  i for one think that the eu should collectively help compensate if such economic losses incur . 
   and of all the countries bordering ukraine , only slovakia is capable of that . 
  also poland and hungary have the capability already in place . 
  hungary and poland could ship up to about quarter of ukraine 's summertime gas demand . 
  and reverse flow from slovakia would add about twice that amount . 
  there 's buildup of about 35000-40000 russian troops in ** multiple locations ** near ukraine 's border , not just one single location or one base . 
  troops that were not there before . 
  troops that are ready for attack and have set up the logistics for that . 
  check the links , look at the images , read the analyses - there 's no question about that . 
  i do n't know why you keep on insisting that it 's only one small base . 
  that 's obviously not what 's happening . 
   to be honest it does n't really look like a military buildup , it just looks like a military base . 
  when you have a military where none existed a while before it indeed is military buildup . 
  jane 's analysis from a week ago : [ russian buildup around belgorod continues ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/36324/russian-buildup-around-belgorod-continues ) bbc : [ in pictures : russian military build-up near ukraine ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26968312 ) also interesting piece in the daily beast : [ exclusive : u.s. wo n't share invasion intel with ukraine ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/08/exclusive-u-s-won-t-share-invasion-intel-with-ukraine.html ) there 's absolutely no question about it : russia 's military buildup very near ukraine 's border . 
  it 's also notable that it seems not to be for defence but attack , and not for mere monitoring purposes as they have also set up field hospitals and other support logistics ready for action . 
  putin 's promised withdrawal of his troops has not happened , to the contrary they 've been preparing for action and are even readier now . 
  also election fraud is routinely done in russia and it 's quite visible in mathematical analysis - [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t93foro.png ) related blogpost : [ finding the statistical fingerprints of election thieves ] ( http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/pnas-thurner-fingerprints-election-thieves/ ) and the research paper published by pnas : [ statistical detection of systematic election irregularities ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/20/1210722109.abstract ) would be interesting to see similar analysis of the so-salled referendum in crimea . 
  my point ? 
  it was to provide additional relevant information related to op . 
   i do n't think china is on the path to becoming a super power , just on a path to become a great power ( which it arguably already is ) . 
  i also believe russia is a great power , but one to much less degree than china . 
  classifying them is to some degree merely an academic exercise . 
  but i would n't call them great powers as their ability to project power on global scale is limited . 
  they 're both * regional powers * and * emerging powers * . 
  what sets china apart and puts it ahead of russia is for example economy . 
  russia has remained at the level of exporting resources with very little industrial products , and the industry russia has is not that advanced . 
  russia for example does n't have a single factory producing integrated circuits . 
  china has heavily invested to modern industrial production since the 80s , and has become a big exporter of advanced industrial goods and high tech . 
  there 's also similar huge differences in science and r&d which both have been lagging in russia , while china has invested into them for decades and is now among the world top countries in scientific research and r&d . 
  that . 
  there are russian spies within ukraine 's gov and security apparatus . 
  would not be smart to share the intelligence data as it could end up into wrong hands compromising the methods of getting it in the first place . 
  and at least at the moment sharing such intelligence is not that vital anyway . 
  but situation may change quickly . 
  if shit hits the fan i think us military advisors will use us intelligence for strategic advice to ukraine , and perhaps even giving some limited intelligence data but not sharing it all . 
  with no less than telepathic attacks !, 
   bulut also claimed that powerful groups , possibly both inside and outside the country , were trying to kill erdo\u011fan -- via telepathic attacks -- because of his struggle against the interest rate lobby . 
  truly a great geopolitical mind , this bulut guy . 
  nobody laughing at him at all . 
  ukraine has already halted buying gas from russia as the price dispute is not settled : [ u.k. gas reaches april high as ukraine halts imports from russia ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-09/u-k-gas-reaches-april-high-as-ukraine-halts-imports-from-russia.html ), 
  and it 's all because we 're lacking putin 's protection . 
   personally i am surprised about finland ?!, 
  wtf ? 
  yeah , i was also at first but then noticed : 1 . 
  the scale used in colouring has a large step in ranges with the [ sudden 2.5-6 .99 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9fozxe1 ) 2 . 
  the homicide rates in finland 's northern & eastern regions are indeed higher compared to other regions , but despite being large areas they 're also sparsely populated . 
  in 2012 there were 89 homicides in finland with rate of ** 1.6 ** which is n't that exceptional ( us : 4.8 - and i bet there 's regional variation over there too ), 
  yeah , he did mention moody 's grade in his post . 
  does not excuse nor make up his complete lack of numbers though . 
  additionally , moody 's disagrees with our blogist on an important issue :  the agency cited ukraine 's deteriorating relations with russia as a concern , specifically referring to the referendum on crimea , and russia 's annexation of the black sea peninsula . 
  while for some reason mark adomanis claims that this has no bearing on his claimed imminent default :  even if the situation in eastern ukraine does n't entirely spin out of control , the country 's economy has already unraveled to the point that a substantial default is now essentially unavoidable . 
  so he disagrees with moody 's while citing them as support . 
  and then proceeds with his claims without providing any substance in form of actual numbers . 
   russian pigs !, 
  not cool , man . 
   easily spotted from their less than perfect english it 's entertaining when they use terms and concepts that went out of fashion several decades ago . 
  it 's like receiving letters through a wormhole , like reading old magazines with words like ` electronic brain ' for a computer or ` aeronaut ' for a pilot . 
  those astroturfers sound a lot how i 'd imagine nazis from the moon . 
   i 'm hoping russia takes the gloves off , cozies up to china and together start claiming all their disputed territory mfw they start doing exactly that and russia realizes it has a super power as neighbour . 
  okay , china is not a super power and neither is russia . 
  but china is on a track of becoming a super power while russia is n't . 
  also this is happening in chinese social media : [ netizens compare lost chinese territory to crimea crisis ] ( http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/netizens-compares-lost-chinese-territory-to-the-crisis-in-crimea.html ) those chinese netizens do n't seem to be too happy about how the red army occupied and annexed regions into the soviet union using pseudo-referendums :  the russia that has never done any good ; if it 's not destroyed , then there is no justice in the world . 
  a related jane 's analysis from a week ago : [ russian buildup around belgorod continues ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/36324/russian-buildup-around-belgorod-continues ) also interesting piece in the daily beast : [ exclusive : u.s. wo n't share invasion intel with ukraine ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/08/exclusive-u-s-won-t-share-invasion-intel-with-ukraine.html ) * american spies have spotted all the signs of an all-out russian invasion of ukraine . 
  why wo n't they tell the ukrainians about the forces on their border ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21nt35/20_maps_of_prejudice_in_europe_xpost_from_mapporn/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21s0v9/atlas_of_prejudice/, 
   even with substantial international assistance , ukraine is going to owe a lot of money to a lot of different people and it is n't going to have the means necessary to pay this money back . 
  it would help mark adomanis ' case a lot if he brought actual numbers to the table . 
   the obvious solution to ukraine 's problems would be more generous assistance from the united states or the european union , ditto . 
   so ukraine is going to go through a messy default great analysis , who needs numbers anyway . 
  it 's not like they 're even remotely relevant for an economic analysis . 
  numbers , schumbers . 
  ukraine has so much bills - * but i 'm not telling you how much * - and the financing is so small - * but i 'm not going to tell you how much that is either * - that only more financing would solve the problem - * but i 'm not going to estimate how much more nor why * - therefore a default will certainly happen because i , mark adomanis the blogist , say so . 
   the yield rate is 5-5 .25 % , which is surprising . 
  that 's a very low rate for such a high risk . 
  that was just the nominal stated rate . 
  but as the sale was eight times oversubscribed the yield lowered to ** 4.95 % ** . 
  which is a very good result indeed , and the sale was a big success to greek gov. 
   you 'd have to be incredibly positive and/or stupid to buy these bonds . 
  the market seems to think otherwise : [ bbc news - huge investor demand for greek five year bond ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26967027 ), 
  the bonds are issued under english law . 
  no syriza can change that . 
  cato institute is non-interventionist and this opinion piece reflects that bias . 
  does not mean nato defence is suddenly under question in reality . 
  and the gov seems to be aware of this risk and kazakhstan has been moving native kazakhs to the north to dilute the russian population 's share there . 
   not financing - this is just debt that will need to be repaid . 
  [ ignorance intensifies ], 
   counter-revolution . 
  no , it 's not about restoring yanukovich to power . 
  i mean , his popularity has eroded to almost non-existent and is only marginal even in his former support bases in eastern ukraine .
