   do you really think that we have one channel in russia ? 
  just as you do we have opportunity to watch anything you 've mentioned both through internet and tv network it does n't really matter if russians have an access to those channels as only about 5 % of russians speak english . 
  russian state controls the tv-channels and broadcasting in russia , and they 're broadcasting their propaganda in russian . 
   fox probably has the most blatant , ridiculous propaganda but it 's not us state propaganda . 
  while fox is biased , it 's leaning towards the gop . 
  it 's a conservative channel with heavy conservative bias . 
  hence it broadcasts claims that are very critical of the democrats and the current democrat administration - sometimes even to the point of being ridiculous . 
  broadcasting stories in russian television how putin is probably not a russian citizen , or may be a muslim , or how everything he does is morally wrong and damaging to russia will get you out of air , and probably to jail . 
   but the others have a fair amount of bias as well . 
  every news channel and news outlet has their own biases . 
  it is journalism 101 . 
  but as you have heterogenous media field you do have choises between those , and you get to hear those different biases . 
  not so when you have state controlled media , then you have only the state bias and state propaganda . 
  and i agree with your general sentiment . 
  my personal totally subjective feel is that the quality of journalism in the us has been declining since the 90s . 
  perhaps not by much , but noticeably . 
  there seems to be less investigative journalism with big stories and big revelations than there used to be . 
  i do n't know why that is ( less resources perhaps ? 
  ) , and it is only my subjective perception . 
  it 's just like fox news then ? 
  no , not really . 
  but if it claimed that vladimir putin is actually a muslim and not even russian citizen , and everything he does is wrong and damaging to the country , then it would be a bit like fox news . 
   it is hard to expect major american channels to go full-throttle critical about the us , would n't you say ? 
  have you ever watched for example fox news ? 
  it 's full of stories about what 's wrong in america and how it 's us goverment 's fault - especially obama 's . 
   taking hostages and then denying it would make these guys the silliest terrorists in history . 
  it would make perfect sense in this case . 
  firstly , they certainly would not want to appear publicly as hostage taking terrorists - i mean even ~ ~ putin ~ ~ russia today would have hard time to spin that story . 
  secondly , human shields . 
  the purpose of hostages would be just to keep the goverment from storming the building , unlike in many other hostage situations where maximum publicity is wanted for threats unless demands are met . 
  thirdly , anschluss provocation . 
  having hostages would be handy for creating civilian victims for putin 's pretext for military invasion . 
  shoot them or explode them and suddenly the eastern ukraine is in urgent need of putin 's ` protection ' . 
  and he has troops ready . 
  actually , their citizenships and identities were unknown as they had no papers on them when arrested . 
  they merely claimed to be ukrainians . 
  some of them are apparently exports from russia : [ kerry says russia creating pretext for ukraine invasion ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/04/08/ukraine-kharkiv-protesters/7459031/ )  pro-russia demonstrators in ukraine 's east are getting support from russians inside ukraine , though the `` volunteers '' as they are called may not all be acting on orders from moscow , say experts and pro-russia groups . 
   `` they do n't make up a big share of the demonstrators , but there are up to a thousand russian volunteers in ukraine , '' said analyst sergei markov , a backer of the russian government who has advised the kremlin on ukraine . 
  `` they make up maybe 1 % demonstrators . '', 
   asked if those volunteers would be willing to take up arms if a conflict broke out , markov said `` of course . '', 
   markov said the actions of the russian volunteers is `` largely '' spontaneous . 
  if violent clashes erupt , `` the number of volunteers will grow significantly . '', 
   `` sometimes they coordinate their activities with ( russian authorities ) , sometimes they do n't , '' he said . 
  * `` of course . 
  an english source : [ protesters storm kharkiv theater thinking it was city hall ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/protesters-storm-kharkiv-theater-thinking-it-was-city-hall/497709.html ), 
   because the same reason why maidan protesters got violent and took over buildings and all , although they were allowed to voice their opinion . 
  the ball of violence got rolling 30 november at 4:00 am when the berkut special police forces violently attacked completely peaceful protesters voicing their opinion at maidan nezalezhnosti . 
  the berkut used batons , stun grenades and tear gas . 
  79 people were injured including journalists with cameras . 
  later the police claimed they did it because of the need to put up christmas decorations on the maidan . 
  that violent raid led to huge mass protests . 
  * my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 * - dat sense of shame you feel on someone else 's behalf when ( s ) he really screwed up * pilkunnussija * - lit . 
  comma fucker , the universal pedant always correcting meaningless trivialities also , * perkele * !, 
  also moldovan wines . 
  remember when yanukovich regime was shooting and killing protesters including russian speakers and ethnic russians and russia told him not to use force ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
   people who illegally seized government buildings in kiev were freedom fighters . 
  actually ukrainian goverment called them terrorists . 
   people who illegally seized government buildings in kharkhiv are terrorists . 
  apparently also in this case the ukrainian government has called them terrorists . 
  so , we have two instances of people illegally seizing gov buidings and government calling them terrorists . 
  apparently illegally seizing government buildings in ukraine may lead to goverment calling you a terrorist , albeit a sample of two is a bit small for firm conclusions . 
  * keep your frienemies close but your frienemies closer . 
  * - sun tzu, 
  and based on the points on the map it is not immediately clear if people were ignorant of the geographical location of ukraine or merely confused of its size . 
   gazprom chief executive alexei miller raised questions about the legality of reversing gas flows to ukraine in an interview aired on russian state television on saturday . 
  and the eu has raised questions about the legality of contractual clausules restricting gas flows , and an investigation and legal case has been in the works since 2012 : [ antitrust : commission opens proceedings against gazprom ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-937_en.htm?locale=fr ) i do n't know what the current status of the case is or how the legal action is proceeding . 
  ukraine . 
  it 's ... canberra !, 
   but the opposition made all indications that it would not honour deals that yanukovich made with putin , the new government was not about to nullify the kharkov pact , in fact they specifically said they will uphold it . 
  it was russia that nullified it . 
   whilst simultaneously inviting nato in , the new government did n't do that either . 
  both your claims are unsubstantiated , and invented as a justification for putin 's possible * feelings * . 
  putin has failed at his foreign policy , hence the unnecessary use of military power . 
  the naval base would have been easily secured by soft power alone . 
  but for putin it 's all a zero sum game , and as he opted out from the soft power he has lost the game on the long run . 
  ukraine will distance itself from russia even more , and it 's putin 's fault . 
  and him claiming crimea annexed is a pyrrhic victory . 
  in long run it does n't even matter if he ` annexes ' more , because it will all be temporary . 
  putin 's regime wo n't last forever , and when it falls it wo n't have a soft landing . 
  they are ? 
  til . 
  in finnish they 're all it ( * se * ) . 
  if you 're interested , here 's a pretty good assessment of the relevant strategy : [ ukraine : invasion is russia 's fallback option ] ( http://server1.nationalinterest.org/commentary/ukraine-invasion-russias-fallback-option-10197 ) my thinking is much along similar lines . 
  currently it is important to keep russia away from the fallback option . 
  keeping sanctions in place and extending them only stepwise as necessary is the most effective way to do it . 
  currently - but one has to remember that the situation is tense and volatile : putin 's foreign policy is a failure , his great project is crumbling and there is a possibility of him resorting to the fallback option . 
  additionally , as crazy as it may sound now , i do n't think russia 's claimed annexation of crimea is more than of temporary nature . 
  putin 's regime is not going to last forever and it wo n't fall down softly when its time has run out ( a decade ? 
   russia is very good at this sort of thing and based on the level of fail on their site finnbay is n't . 
   do you think that the general lack of gender in the finnish language has influenced society at all ? 
  personally i do n't think so , but then again it 's difficult for me to say as i 'm immersed in it , and the question needs more of a scholarly opinion . 
  i have sometimes seen * painotus * but that 's not exactly the same either . 
  no offence taken at all , and i apologize my tone . 
  sometimes it 's just frustrating how easily the kremlin narrative of history is accepted and repeated even by the media which should have a crical eye . 
   do you have words that you can put a gender on , like actor and actress ? 
  yes , you can add it in a kind of awkward and archaic way with * - tar / - t\u00e4r * : * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * , actor * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4t\u00e4r * , actress but using * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4t\u00e4r * is rare , and * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * goes just as well for both genders . 
  if gender needs to be emphasized then it 's more common to express it more explicitly by adding if it 's a man ( * mies - * ) or woman ( * nais - * ) we 're talking about : * miesn\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * , male actor * naisn\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * , female actor but most often it 's just simply * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * for both . 
   or is everything gender neutral ? 
  basically yes , and explicitly stating gender has to be done by additional constructs .
