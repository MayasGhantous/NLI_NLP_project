  before that putin had vehemently denied it even against the accumulating evidence of it happening . 
  only after the fact did he admit that he had lied about it . 
   for europe to start getting its gas from a currently planned us pipeline to europe . 
  such pipeline would be a pretty fantastical contraption . 
  but with lng shipping the us will indeed be a serious contender to russia 's current gas monopolies in europe . 
  and not the only one . 
  so far lng has been an underdeveloped market but with more suppliers and customers entering it lng is quickly becoming a new trade commodity . 
   no , that seems like an awful long way to transport it . 
  marine transport is cheap . 
  for us gas `` it costs about $ 3 per 1,000 cubic feet to liquefy natural gas , about $ 1 to transport it to europe and $ 1 or so to turn the liquefied natural gas back into a gas . '', 
  ( [ can u.s. natural gas rescue ukraine from russia ? 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/03/25/can-u-s-natural-gas-rescue-ukraine-from-russia/ ) ) the actual reason keeping lng prices high has not been marine transport but underdeveloped market : it takes significant investments to produce and export lng , and also the customers need relevant degasification infrastructure . 
  hence there have been few producers with few customers , and the prices have been decided accordingly . 
  but now , as new customers and more producers are entering the market it is becoming more and more a normal commodity market and prices are going down accordingly . 
   38 % drop in eu gas flow less than that today and getting lesser . 
   otherwise russia will sell the lng to asia in the mid term . 
  what lng ? 
  russia sells natural gas not as lng but as gas by pipelines . 
   russia is also establishing a gas pipeline through north korea to sell to south korea so ? 
  if that idea actually moves forward it will still be a small fraction of the eu natural gas consumption , not a replacement , even smaller that the planned pipeline projects with china which are also a fraction of the eu imports . 
   and more expensive gas . 
  actually it 's the monopoly pricing that tends to be the more expensive one on the long run .

   as far as anyone in russia is aware , we are not about to `` invade '' the baltic states . 
  as far as anyone was aware in russia , you were not about to invade the ukraine either . 
  in fact russia and russians vehemently denied it happening until after the fact the great leader putin admitted he had lied and actually had invaded ukraine . 
  the fact that you still deny it ever happening is nothing short of amazing . 
   why are `` soccer hooligans '' in europe politically active ? 
  the phenomenon varies a lot between countries and there is no single why to cover all of it . 
  not all football fan clubs are politically active . 
  and the political activity is more pronounced in some countries . 
  but basically ( and not in any way comprehensively , i hope others with expertise get bothered enough to add ) : 1 . what ? 
  in some european countries you 'll find some football fan clubs clearly aligning either to the right or to the left , and some to the far ends of the spectrum . 
  i do n't know if there are moderate centrist football fan clubs , but if there are they sure do n't seem to riot about it . 
  and then there 's also many fan clubs not particularly engaged in political activity , not clearly aligned politically , or with politically heterogeneous member base . 
  ideologies vary a lot , it 's a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord from extremes of socialism to anti-racism to nationalism or even xenophobia , and ideologies do not always correlate on the traditional left-right spectrum . 
  for example , i believe one can find leftist football fan clubs peppered with nationalism . 
  most often the fan clubs are negligible as a political force , depending on the country , and most often their political messages are limited to good will activities such as raising cancer awareness , anti-racism , charities for the homeless , children 's hospitals etc. 
  but potentially , if the fan clubs unite behind a common cause , they could become a significant factor of political change - a recent example being ukrainian ultras uniting against the yanukovich regime . 
  and vice versa , sometimes an authoritarian regime ( e.g. 
  in belorussia ) may abuse the fan clubs and guarantee their subservience to the regime by making them dependent on the current political elite by funding , favours , by not investigating their possible criminal activity , by abusing the judiciary system , or by seeing that the fan club leadership is regime 's ` made men ' . 
  2 . how ? 
  the political stance or alignment of a football club may manifest in many ways . 
  sometimes just simply that a person identifies for example as a leftist and hence is more likely to join a traditionally leftist fan club , and this self-selection process tends to keep the fan base leftist even without any actual political activity by the fan club . 
  and sometimes a political message is publicly shared between fan clubs such as public statements of anti-racism policies , and not exclusively european as also north american sports clubs share those . 
  some fan clubs are clearly engaged in political activity , making noise about it , and attracting new members by it . 
  the political activity itself varies a lot between clubs from promoting election candidates to rioting . 
  often the more extreme the ideologies the more noise they make , and this is one of the reasons we often tend to hear about those subscribing to nationalism or even xenophobia . 
  in some countries the political establishment may use some of the suitable fan clubs to further their goals , and otoh the political activities by a fan club may be very much anti-establishment . 
  3 . why ? 
  populism , opportunism , and especially history . 
  different european countries have a different past and that 's one of the reasons the phenomenon varies so much between countries . 
  often it can be traced back merely to old class divisions which may or may not be relevant today . 
  to put it simply : a long time ago a bunch of well-to-dos established a football club in a university and it became the club that the well-to-dos of the city supported . 
  the workers in the same city could n't join the well-to-do club and established their own competing football clubs the workers supported . 
  the result was separate clubs with different fan bases with different political views . 
  and over many decades that division became a tradition : even if the football clubs themselves are not politically aligned any more , and the actual players are hired millionaires not proclaiming relevant political opinions , a right-winger is more likely to support the traditional well-to-do 's club and a leftist the traditional worker 's club . 
  in some countries there have been traumatic events such as civil wars with deep divisions and some of those remaining either by continuous division or by tradition . 
  for example , after the civil war in finland also the sports clubs were divided along the ` whites ' or ` reds ' lines , and that tradition carried on for a long time with separate sports organisations even after the civil war division itself was mostly gone after the unifying effect of the soviet invasion . 
  hence we still have two competing sports associations : the finnish amateur athletic association and the finnish workers ' sports federation with their respective remnants of political alignments and connections . 
  but generally the football or hockey fan clubs are not engaged in political activity , albeit to some extent there 's at least some tendency for a right winger and a left winger to identify with particular teams . 
  and some european countries endured under dictatorships or authoritarian regimes for decades during the 20th century . 
  the extreme ideologies of those regimes , communism and fascim , saw sports as political activity of and for the masses , and they very much used it as such . 
  in those countries the ruling regime made sports a political arena where also the fan clubs were supposed to provide their support for the regime . 
  4 . an extreme example from history : [ the nika riots , with opposing racing fan clubs ` blues ' vs ` greens ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nika_riots ), 
   in 2010 all cypriot banks , including the one that collapsed spectacularly , passed an eu-wide stress test . 
  by the end of 2009 the cypriot banks had gotten rid of their of their toxic greek bonds , as recommended , and they had only a small exposure to greek sovereign debt . 
  they passed that stress test but then they had started to purchase greek bonds en masse even hiding them from the balance sheets . 
  which was an insane idea , and when the greek debt haircut happened it caused huge losses to the exposed cypriot banks . 
  [ insight : why did cypriot banks keep buying greek bonds ?

  having said that , i 'll just take this opportunity to repost from the other thread some photos and videos ( actually ) from the airport .

   the chechens and the local rebels attacked the airport . 
  the ukrainian garrision was about to lose until kiev sent airpower . 
  the rebels had no answer to ukraine 's air supremacy and were unable to take the airport . 
  a lot of them got wounded and one of their trucks carrying injured chechens crashed when they were fleeing . 
  here 's an interesting interview of one of the russian militants participating in the battle of donetsk airport in may 24-25th : [ i was a separatist fighter in ukraine ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-i-was-a-separatist-fighter/25455466.html ) according to him after they had fled from the airport in trucks they got ambushed by other separatists , and that 's how many of them got killed and wounded in the trucks :  someone told me that only three guys survived from the first truck . 
  there was panic and terror . 
  someone told me that one guy blew himself up with a grenade to avoid being taken prisoner by the ukrainians . 
  they did n't understand that they were being attacked by their own people . 
  someone apparently told local militiamen that right sector [ a ukrainian nationalist group that was part of the maidan protest movement ] fighters were rushing down the highway in two trucks . 
  ... on television they said something like that the militias were transporting unarmed wounded under the sign of the red cross and ukrainian forces fired on them . 
  at that point , i still did n't know we 'd been attacked by our own forces . 
  i was sure it was the national guard . 
  sometime in the morning of the 27th , two guys from the cover group that remained at the airport woke me up . 
  they told me that it was friendly fire .
