  gazprom hopes to sell to china up to 38 bcm/year via the possible pipeline from 2018 onwards . 
  and china quite likes to keep its resources hedged . 
  by far most of its natural gas is domestic production and what it imports is from various suppliers , and this is also reflected in the existing pipelines and ongoing projects with various countries such as myanmar , turkmenistan , uzbekistan and kazakhstan . 
   is it ? 
  why ? 
  to me it reads like badly written prose . 
  it 's almost painful to read with its crappy metaphores like * '' ... this central-eastern european country , which no longer describes itself as a ` republic ' on road signs ... '' * . 
  that site surely could use an editor or two . 
   do you disagree with the main thrust of the article ? 
  there was a main thrust in it ? 
   but the 3 million vs. 1.5 million are the cumulative numbers admitted in the u.s. and the eu , switzerland , and norway , respectively . 
  i put the 2.6 million number since 1980 up there just because i found the direct statistics for it . 
  for no particular reason , just because you happened to come by such number . 
  when you look at those two maps i provided , and hopefully remember the relevant history ( like , have you heard about the iron curtain and its implications ? 
  ) , and the huge changes that have taken place in the eu and europe since 1980 does it not occure to you that using * cumulative * numbers since 1980 for such comparison * does not make any sense * ? 
   finland is more dependent on russia for oil . 
  around 80 % of our oil comes from russia . 
  again , supply does not mean dependency . 
  currently finland imports about 89 % of its crude oil from russia , but it has not always been so as suppliers and their shares have varied : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htz6nhm ) in short : finland is not dependend on the russian oil . 
  if their share of crude oil imports was to decline it would get replaced by other suppliers although there would be some costs attached , and there would probably be a short term shock in prices . 
   if the oil stops flowing from russia , fuel prices will go sky high and the finnish economy would probably collapse . 
  currently finland imports most of the crude oil from russia , but suppliers , their shares and prices have varied a lot through the last two decades without causing a collapse of finland 's economy . 
  oil prices , including imports from russia , are dependend on the * world market prices * . 
  there are many producers and exporters of crude oil in the world , and even if the market price was to rise and would therefore cause expences with negative impact it would not collapse our economy . 
  see how the prices have varied during the last decade : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z6doemo ), 
   british mep nigel farage found a surprise on his desk in parliament : somebody replaced his union jack with a russian flag and a bottle of vodka lol, 
   the latest rise will be to ** $ 485 per 1,000 cubic meters ** - two days after gazprom announced a 44 percent increase in the gas price to $ 385.5 per 1,000 cubic meters from $ 268.5 due to unpaid bills . 
  this is much more than the average price paid by consumers in the european union . 
  holy shit !, 
  the average gazprom price to european countries is about $ 380 per 1,000 cubic meters including the cost of transit . 
  as the transit to ukraine is much shorter than to the european hubs the $ 485 is simply ridiculous price . 
  and when the reverse flow from slovakia to ukraine gets implemented it will be cheaper to import gas from the european hubs . 
   valery nesterov , an analyst with sberbank cib , said ukraine could apply to an international court for a settlement . 
  yep , ukraine would have a good case and would probably win . 
   medvedev said that a promised $ 15 billion aid package was still in the cards for * the old soviet ally . 
  is this guy inventing stuff or did he actually say that ? 
   but when new ukrainian leaders , with pro-western arseniy yatsenyuk as prime minister , took over kiev they made it known that being anti-russia was their top priority . 
  their first order of business was to remove the russian language in official communications in the government . 
  * facepalm * not that same-o bullshit again . 
   his poorly timed language policy irked the russian majority in the crimean peninsula , an autonomous region on the black sea . 
   crimea 's government moved just as quickly and voted on a referendum to secede , which passed nearly unanimously among the peninsula 's population on march 16 . 
  looks like he simply forgot the military invasion part . 
  yeah , happens easily to anyone . 
  that guy is full of shit . 
   they practically own the baltic infra , finland , either directly through gazprom or through gazprom-proxies in finland [ gasum ] ( http://www.gasum.com/yritystietoa/gasum-in-brief/organisation/owners/ ) owns natural gas network and also other facilities and gas infra . 
  gazprom is one of the owners of the company but that does not mean gazprom would practically own the gas infra in finland . 
  the company has four owners : fortum heat and gas oy : 31 % oao gazprom : 25 % finnish state : 24 % e.on ruhrgas international gmbh : 20 %, 
   i generally agree with you that supply does not equal dependency and it would be necessary to compare gas consumption to total energy consumption . 
  only about 10 % of all primary energy in finland is from natural gas . 
  it is used in some power plants to produce electricity and district heat , while household gas is rare . 
  100 % of that natural gas is from russia , but supply does not mean dependency . 
  if for some reason the natural gas stopped flowing tomorrow no-one would freeze to death in finland because those power plants can switch over to other fuels - although there would be costs in doing that . 
  there are existing plans for such case to arise , and legislation in finland requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time . 
   but adapting infrastructure and contracts to change supply from one nation to another is a complex and long process . 
  there are plans and proposals such as the new lng terminal with estonia , the proposed mid-nordic gas pipeline from norway through sweden to finland , the nordic gas grid and the north transgas project . 
  but all those would be years away . 
  but as said , if needed finland could do without russian gas albeit there would be some costs attached . 
  indeed . 
  for example in finland natural gas is only about 10 % of all primary energy . 
  it is used in some power plants to produce electricity and district heat , while household gas is rare . 
  100 % of that natural gas is from russia . 
  if for some reason the natural gas stopped flowing tomorrow no-one would freeze to death because those power plants can switch over to other fuels although there would be costs in doing that . 
  there are existing plans for such case to arise , and legislation in finland requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time . 
  the national emergency supply agency is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution . 
  perhaps i 'm a bit confused as you seem to be using terms eu and europe interchangeably . 
  but anyway , look here 's the eu ( or eec ) in 1980 [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hxiszu1 ) here 's the eu in 2012 [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0roxfky ) since you 're apparently comparing cumulative figures dating back to 1980 ( ! ), 
  do n't you think you should also account for quite big developments like that ? 
  and why do you think 1980 is relevant year for such comparison in the first place ? 
   i do n't want to be rude , but even if your politicians did n't butcher defence spending , what chance do you think you would have against russia on your own ? 
  on their own as russia invading sweden only ? 
  i think pretty good actually , because :  sweden is number 32 in world military spending , with russia number 3 , sweden spends less than 10 % of what russia spends on it 's military . 
  is actually not the relevant metric here . 
  you 'd need to take a look at a map first and see where that military power would be projected . 
  for example russia is quite large country with huge area to defend therefore it would be able to project only a fraction of its total military power on sweden . 
  another thing is that there 's limited space to project it at . 
  then another thing is the quality of that power , like russian tanks not effective at sea or their artillery in st.petersburg not effective against stockholm . 
  in order to invade sweden russia would have to invade finland first . 
  and this is the relevant and also more messy part . 
   so they probably have much less carbon output even though they only have 13 % renewables . 
  in 2011 france was the # 4 ghg emitter in the eu with 10.6 % share . 
  france has reduced its ghg emissions by 12.7 % from 1990 levels mainly by reductions in n2o emissions from adipic acid production but meanwhile co2 emissions from road transport have increased . 
  yet all in all france is well on its 2020 reduction target . 
   first of all this is only electricity , no , it 's the ** % share of renewables of gross final energy consumption ** . 
  definition as per the source document linked itt :  renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy , hydro ( including tide , wave and ocean energy ) , wind , geothermal energy and biomass ( including biological waste and liquid biofuels ) . 
  the contribution of renewable energy from heat pumps is also covered for the member states for which this information was available . 
  the renewable energy delivered to final consumers ( industry , transport , households , services including public services , agriculture , forestry and fisheries ) is the numerator of the europe 2020 target . 
  the denominator , the gross final energy consumption of all energy sources , covers total energy delivered for energy purposes to final consumers as well as the transmission and distribution losses for electricity and heat . 
   this is a bit confusing . 
  it 's not at all confusing when keeping in mind what numbers are being dicussed . 
  the map is the % share of renewables of * gross final energy consumption * . 
  that is the number of interest because that 's the one to keep track of the eu 20-20-20 targets for different countries ( 38 % for finland ) . 
  it is to be expected that the number differs from say electricity consumption , electricity production or energy production . 
  and it would be quite amazing if they did n't differ because those are all different measures . 
  here 's the definition for the number in the map :  renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy , hydro ( including tide , wave and ocean energy ) , wind , geothermal energy and biomass ( including biological waste and liquid biofuels ) . 
  the contribution of renewable energy from heat pumps is also covered for the member states for which this information was available .

  ask and you shall get : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tplvw46 ), 
  well , here 's to successful market liberalization then !, 
  if done right you 'll have more choises with competitive pricing from multiple power companies .
