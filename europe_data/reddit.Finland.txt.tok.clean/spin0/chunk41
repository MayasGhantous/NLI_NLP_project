  over here it was done in the 90s and i 'm pretty happy with the results . 
  you can easily get competing bids for electricity from the numerous power companies . 
  they call you from time to time with cheaper deals , or you can use [ web services ] ( http://www.sahkonhinta.fi/search ) to compare the latest prices . 
  and you can choose exclusively renewable sources or even all nuke . 
  according to that website currently the cheapest deal for me would be 100 % renewables electricity at 4.49 cent/kwh from power company 220 energia . 
  the deals vary according to your usage patterns and pricing scheme . 
  often using pricing binded to the [ nord pool spot ] ( http://www.nordpoolspot.com/ ) power market gives you very competitive prices . 
  for example vattenfall spot pricing history for home contract : 2012 2013 average : 4,17 5,34 cent/kwh max monthly : 6,75 6,17 min monthly : 1,93 4,67 ( = spot + 0,25 cent ; not incl . 
  tax 24 % and transfer ) you also have to pay the 24 % tax , and the transfer to the utility running the power infrastructure . 
  unfortunately you really can not have competing bids on that as the utility has an effective monopoly in your area . 
  the transfer prices vary according to where you live roughly between 6-10 cent/kwh . 
  with all expencens combined electricity in finland is about 16-18 cent/kwh on average , but ymmv depending on deal , consumption pattern , area , etc. 
  [ apparently not ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bx7fpac ) while hydro has a significant share of * electricity production * in sweden , the op 's map is about * gross final energy consumption * and biofuels seem to rule in that ( even excluding peat , which eu classifies as a fossil fuel ) . 
  regarding those ghg emissions : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bwdxydl ) ( [ eurostat data ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdcc100 ) ) but there 's many ways to look at it and in reality both germany and france are well on track to meet their ghg targets . 
  from [ the progress report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/docs/com_2013_698_en.pdf ) :  according to the ghg inventory data from 2011 , eight eu-15 member states ( finland , france , germany , greece , ireland , portugal , sweden and the united kingdom ) are likely to achieve their individual ghg reduction targets through domestic emission reductions only , as shown in figure 6 . 
  ireland and portugal are expected to achieve their targets with the use of carbon sinks . 
  austria , belgium , denmark , the netherlands and spain could meet their target by using kyoto flexible mechanisms . 
  taking into account the use of kyoto credits as it is currently planned , luxembourg is not yet on track to achieve its target ( by a 1.7 % gap ) and for italy , the present shortfall is small ( by 0.7 % ) ( see figure 6 ) . 
  both shortfalls can be addressed during the true-up period . 
   in most of the thirteen member states which acceded to the union as from 2004 , emissions are reported to have slightly increased between 2009 and 2012 . 
  however , based on the data currently available , all these eleven member states that have a kyoto target are expected to meet or over-achieve their commitments . 
  it is estimated that for the 1st commitment period these member states overachieved their kyoto targets by a total of 2.4 gt co2 excluding lulucf and emission reduction credits . 
  the remaining two member states , cyprus and malta , have no obligations under the kyoto protocol 's first commitment period . 
  the relevant [ figure 6 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pv1ady7 ) ( negative = overshooting the target , positive = falling behind ), 
  those stats are part of the eu sustainable development strategy . 
  as such they mostly cover eu members but take a look over here if you happen to find also your countries of interest : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/sdi/indicators, 
  why do n't you choose a power company with 100 % renewables ? 
  defined in the source : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/8-10032014-ap/en/8-10032014-ap-en.pdf  renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy , hydro ( including tide , wave and ocean energy ) , wind , geothermal energy and biomass ( including biological waste and liquid biofuels ) . 
  the contribution of renewable energy from heat pumps is also covered for the member states for which this information was available . 
  the renewable energy delivered to final consumers ( industry , transport , households , services including public services , agriculture , forestry and fisheries ) is the numerator of the europe 2020 target . 
  the denominator , the gross final energy consumption of all energy sources , covers total energy delivered for energy purposes to final consumers as well as the transmission and distribution losses for electricity and heat . 
  the map is the share of renewable energy in gross final * energy consumption * by country . 
  your number is the share of renewables in * electricity consumption * in denmark . 
  apples . 
  different numbers , but both correct . 
   for full disclosure , most of their renewable energy comes from hydro . 
  varies a lot between individual scandinavian/nordic countries and really only describes norway . 
   i think that the 20-20-20 target is/was from the eu . 
  yes , those are the eu targets and for germany it 's 18 % of * gross final energy consumption * by 2020 . 
  and with the 12.4 % germany is well on track . 
  the target is defined as :  renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy , hydro ( including tide , wave and ocean energy ) , wind , geothermal energy and biomass ( including biological waste and liquid biofuels ) . 
  the contribution of renewable energy from heat pumps is also covered for the member states for which this information was available . 
  the renewable energy delivered to final consumers ( industry , transport , households , services including public services , agriculture , forestry and fisheries ) is the numerator of the europe 2020 target . 
  the denominator , the gross final energy consumption of all energy sources , covers total energy delivered for energy purposes to final consumers as well as the transmission and distribution losses for electricity and heat . 
   the current target for 2020 ist 35 % they adapted it , after it was so succesfull . 
  yes . 
  that target is 35 % share of * gross electricity consumption * , not to be confused with gross electricity production nor with gross energy consumption ( not saying you did , but just to clarify to a casual reader ) . 
   it would be interesting to read a list of the absolute values . 
  % share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by country : [ eurostat data ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdcc110 ) ( same as in op 's map ) 2 .

  and as germany 's 20-20-20 renewables target is 18 % of gross final energy consumption by 2020 you 're well on track with the map 's 12.4 % and the current trend . 
   before anybody gets worked up , sweden 's renewable percentage 90 % + comes from hydro no , it does n't : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bx7fpac ) the percentages in the op 's map are ** share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption ** . 
  hydro is certainly not 90 % of renewable energy consumption , nor production in sweden . 
  it 's share is a lot smaller . 
  ~ ~ heil ~ ~ yay for liberating the [ kven people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kven_people ) from the fascist neonazi viking oppression and terror . 
  renewable energy does not mean building perpetual machines to produce it . 
  the renewable part refers to the energy source harnessed ( biomass , solar , wind , tidal , geothermal etc ) . 
  and if we are going to split hairs over it by abusing semantics then there is no renewable energy in our universe at all ( re : laws of thermodynamics ) . 
   it is less embarrassing if you use a useful measure like greenhouse gas emissions per capita . 
  yep , the uk has done very well indeed : [ ghg emissions 1990-2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fbedxa2 ) according to the [ progress report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/docs/com_2013_698_en.pdf ) : * `` the reduction of ghg emissions in the united kingdom was primarily the result of switches from oil and coal to natural gas in electricity production and n2o emission reduction measures in the production of adipic acid . 
  '' *  the real problem is the eu mechanism on this mandates daft stuff like green energy and recycling as the answer . 
  we have been improving the energy efficiency of houses which actually does something . 
  we can generate more clean energy or use less energy . 
  the latter works much better . 
  why not both ? 
  the eu [ 20-20-20 objectives ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/progress/index_en.htm ) are reaching -20 % ghg emissions , 20 % share of renewables , and a 20 % improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 . 
  and eu as whole is well on track to meet those targets , in fact even overshooting the ghg target : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ntlxunf ) the individual targets vary by country according to their situation and means . 
  for the uk the renewables target is 15 % of gross final energy consumption by 2020 . 
  in 2012 the share was 4.2 % but has been rising year by year - share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption 2004-2012 ( % ) , eu-28 + norway : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rnuo2p7 ) the uk government [ estimates the 2013 share as 5.4 % ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/britain-one-of-the-lowest-producers-of-renewable-energy-in-the-eu-9219497.html ) , and says the uk is on track to meet the target ( btw , that article confuses energy production with gross final energy consumption ) . 
  it does . 
  it 's the share of renewables of * gross final energy consumption * including traffic etc. 
   renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy , hydro ( including tide , wave and ocean energy ) , wind , geothermal energy and biomass ( including biological waste and liquid biofuels ) .

   `` we are disappointed by the demonstrative silence of the commission in the face of commonly known , including through mass media , facts of violence and discrimination against non-ukrainians , primarily russian-speaking people , by the ` new kiev authorities ' , '' the ministry said . 
  we can not point to actual cases of such but it 's been claimed in our media . 
   talvivaara mine in finland was supposed to hire thousands but what happened was that a few hundred east europeans were hired . 
  while talvivaara deserves critisism on some of its practises it actually has been the biggest empoyer in the area with over 500 hired and creating 1000-2000 jobs indirectly . 
  i do n't know where you 've gotten your idea of ' a few hundred east europeans ' . 
   afterwards talvivaara fell into the hands of government not the mine nor the company has ` fallen into the hands of government ' . 
  talvivaara has been under corporate reorganisation process and just secured $ 20 million from nyrstar . 
  yes , i can . 
   estonia and latvia had some of the worst recession and austerity during the euro crisis + one of them needed bailout . 
  and despite that they 're still doing way better compared to many other post-communist countries : [ ppp per capita gdp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/np53wac ) ( [ data ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:az:am:by:ee:ge:kz:kg:lv:lt:md:ru:tj:tm:ua:uz:bg:hr:cz:hu:pl:ro:rs:sk:si&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=699919200000&amp;tend=1362607200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) ),

  in 2014 greece will return to positive rates of growth after six years of deep recession . 
   which ironically is in favor of russian-instigated wars apparently yep , apparently so and their excuses seem like copypasta of russian state propaganda : [ fisking `` stop the war '' ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/britain-and-ukraine ), 
  also this interesting analysis : [ the russian connection - the spread of pro-russian policies on the european far right ] ( http://www.riskandforecast.com/useruploads/files/pc_flash_report_russian_connection.pdf ), 
   literally dumping simple metal barrels filled with highly radioactive material medium-level and low level radioactive waste, 
   by absorbing the ukrainian economy into the eurozone , the latter is in effect taking under its economic wing yet another ` greece ' and ` spain ' . 
  what has that guy been smoking ? 
  ukraine is not about to enter the eurozone . 
  yes , the article says `` britain one of the lowest producers '' while the numbers are [ share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdcc110 ) .

'', 
  never is a long time . 
  and while the economic downturn has had an effect in lowering the ghg emissions , i havent ' seen any credible analyses ( more substantial than a shallow blog-post ) that it would have been the sole reason .
