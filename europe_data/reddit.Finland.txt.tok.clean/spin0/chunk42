  uk 's progress in cutting its ghg emissions has been commendable indeed : greenhouse gas emissions 1990-2011 ( including aviation ) as compared to 1990 ( = 100 ) , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fbedxa2 ) but the point of the article is that uk has been falling behind in other [ 20-20-20 objectives ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/progress/index_en.htm ) . 
  the key 20-20-20 targets are reaching -20 % ghg emissions ( check !, 
  ) , 20 % share of renewables ( only 4.2 % ) , and a 20 % improvement in energy efficiency ( do n't know the progress there ) all by 2020 . 
   not least efficiency savings such as trying to get our ( largely victorian ) housing stock up to good insulation standards . 
  looks like one of the low hanging fruits to improve energy efficiency . 
  has there been proposals on how to go about it - such as providing incentives for owners to renovate housing with tax breaks or such ? 
  share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption 2004-2012 ( % ) , eu-28 + norway : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rnuo2p7 ) sorry for the awkward format , did n't have the patience to play with the [ eurostat data ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdcc110 ) . 
  `` swedes we are no more , russians we do not want to become , let us therefore be finns . '', 
  - [ adolf ivar arwidsson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_ivar_arwidsson ), 
  this is very important deal to reach : [ gas reverse flow from slovakia to ukraine ] ( http://visegradinsight.eu/reverse-flow-gas-from-slovakia-to-ukraine/ ) the complication is that gazprom is slovakia 's main supplier of gas and might retaliate for linking with ukraine . 
  but i agree with european energy commissioner and i think it 's likely the deal gets signed next month : [ ukraine : eu sees slovak-ukraine gas link deal by end-april ] ( http://www.energy-pedia.com/news/ukraine/new-158602 ), 
   well then either rush to join eu because eu negotiates price for whole region and russia can not charge you more than the rest of the eu no , eu countries have their own deals . 
  seems you have no idea what you 're dicussing and invent stuff as you go . 
  and your original claim :  for the n-th time today they will now pay same price as everyone else remains bs . 
   so the gas of price does not include transport - only gas well , then the new price for ukraine sounds even worse . 
  edit : the average gazprom price to european countries is about $ 380 per 1,000 cubic meters including the cost of transit . 
  +80 % would mean ukraine would have to pay $ 483 and according to you that does n't even include transit . 
  sounds exceedingly pricey to me . 
  and your original claim :  they will now pay same price as everyone else sounds bs . 
   they will now pay same price as everyone else with +80 % the new price of russian natural gas would be higher than what it is in the european hubs - when you remember to account for the transport . 
  and as the transport route from russia to ukraine is lot shorter the new price of gas would be very high indeed . 
   they used to pay very low price because russia had a naval base in ukraine , which they now claim annexed . 
   what 's up with the imf and not wanting people to have heating ? 
  imf recommendations for ukraine have been phasing out the gas subsidies * with accompanied measures to protect the most vulnerable households * , revamping the judicial system , simplifying or repealing burdensome government regulations , stepping up anti-corruption measures , and enforcing clear and consistent rules in tax administration . 
  i do n't think anyone wants people to have no heating . 
  but when 7-8 % of public spending goes in such subsidies as in ukraine it 's the obvious place to cut . 
  and in fact it would be cheaper to compensate the cuts by rising pensions and such accordingly . 
  bbc :  the eu says its financial support , potentially worth 1.6 bn euros ( # 1.3 bn ) is contingent on the imf deal being agreed . 
  that $ 1.6 bn is the mfa part only . 
  actually eu support package is much wider : http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/news/archives/2014/03/pdf/20140306-ukraine-package_en.pdf * $ 3 billion from the eu budget in the coming years , $ 1.6 billion in macro financial assistance loans ( mfa ) and an assistance package of grants of $ 1.4 billion ; * up to $ 8 billion from the european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development ; * potential $ 3.5 billion leveraged through the neighbourhood investment facility ; * setting up of a donor coordination platform ; * provisional application of the deep and comprehensive free trade area when association agreement is signed and , if need be , by autonomous frontloading of trade measures ; * organisation of a high level investment forum/task force ; * modernisation of the ukraine gas transit system and work on reverse flows , notably via slovakia ; * acceleration of visa liberalisation action plan within the established framework ; offer of a mobility partnership ; * technical assistance on a number of areas from constitutional to judicial reform and preparation of elections . 
  and that does n't include private sector investments . 
  by far most of private investment into ukraine comes from the eu as has been for years . 
   i laugh at his stupid comment , boom , -10 , and i even get remembered ( by your kind ) . 
  your comment reads : * lol * it actually says just lol . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  you 're pretending to be amazed it got downvotes , and even publicly complaining about it here . 
  of course , it must be the subreddit conspiring against you and your unpopular opinions . 
  must be the political bias in others . 
  is there a mirror in your apartment ? 
  why do n't you stop browsing internet for a second and go and take a look . 
   i said that they have illegal activities on higher scale such as people in government etc and that is reality , somewhere that does n't affect people as much , but somewhere that is a bigger not-easy-to-live-normally problem . 
  no , you said : * almost every government has people who have some kind of ties to the native mafia of their own country . 
  is this really news ? 
  * which is idiotic . 
  and insisting on it by moving goalposts is even more so . 
   as for supporting people who broke the law , sashko biliy was an open nazi , i 'm not sure if he was a nazi but the * was * part is you grasping at straws . 
   and tymoshenko was in jail before the revolution . 
  and was released by vote of * the parliament * . 
  not sure how that gives more credence on your original claim . 
   again , double standards , when people are supporting eu it 's ok , when they are pro-russian everyone loses their mind . 
  how about * you * check your standards . 
  look , personally i like serbs just as other nations and people in europe - including russians . 
  but you 're not helping with your soviet whataboutism in an effort to avoid recognizing that russia installing an organized crime guy as a pm in another country actually is news . 
   we , are . 
  60 comments in less than an hour . 
  that 's not common here . 
  sorry , you 're not the middle of attention but whatever floats your boat . 
  ( note to self : avoid discussion with * nationalistic * serbs , danger of needy clinging )  for the first part of your post , mafia and illegal activities are everywhere , no , mafia is not everywhere . 
  and yes , in every country there 's illegal activities - it 's called * crime * in legal jargon . 
  none of which establishes any of what you originally said . 
   it 's a product of modern democracy and flaws of capitalism ( i am aware that there is n't a better alternative ) it 's just that when it 's russian 's fault , they will be bashed into oblivion , when it 's somebody from eu everyone is going to act normal . 
  i have n't seen a single thread defending mafia or organized crime in this sub . 
  you could produce a representing sample of such threads or withdraw your baseless claim . 
   i am not protecting anyone , but people react completely opposite when something bad happens in russia , and lets say some eu country . 
  the news piece was not about something bad happening in russia as they did not install the new pm in russia . 
  they installed that guy with organized crime background and 4 % votes in another country . 
   this really is a thing , is this thread i was downvoted because i said that almost every goverment has corruption and people who do illegal stuff and first reply was mockery of my country . 
  you got downvoted because of the depth of stupidity of your comment . 
  c'mon read it : * almost every government has people who have some kind of ties to the native mafia of their own country . 
  is this really news ? 
  * i do n't even go into the incorrectness of your first sentence , but yes it is news that the newly russian installed puppet pm with only 4 % election support in crimea has an organized crime background . 
  it may be not news to you . 
  you may have long ago known that the russian installed puppet ` the goblin ' has ties with organized crime . 
  but news it is , especially with new evidence . 
  another , and more important reason for the downvotes is the obvious soviet era propaganda [ whattaboutism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) in that comment . 
  read what you wrote . 
  think about it . 
  it makes no sense at all . 
  hence you were asked if you 're hired to look serbs bad or if it was unintentional . 
   i like that we are in the middle of attention again , i kinda missed it . 
  sorry , you 're not . 
  indeed , [ can not have such propaganda in the pure heterosexual russia ] ( http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140206/187237490/russian-prosecutors-probe-childrens-book-for-gay-propaganda.html ) . 
  hence the improved translation by the * non-gay central translation agency for the purity of russian soul * : but not unpleased ; and on their way , they grow estranged , hostile , depressed . 
  arrived , you see them , side by side, 
  after looking into it apparently orginates from jean de la fontaine 's animal fable * [ the bear and the amateur gardener ] ( http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta8.html#sebeargard ) * , which in turn originates from ancient indian fables : [ panchatantra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bidpai ) . 
  yeah , that sounds very similar to * vasemmistoliitto * ( left alliance ) in finland . 
  left alliance joining the government coalition was one of the conditions by the social democratic party ( sdp ) as they wanted to keep their left wing guarded knowing how difficult decisions and reforms will have to get done . 
  the coalition negotiations were difficult and took months but the left alliance accepted the goverment agenda they had been negotiating and joined the government . 
  except not all of them - right away they had to kick out of their parliamentary group two mps voting against the government agenda the party had just accepted . 
  after that there has been recurring discordances within the coalition regarding the needed reforms . 
  the left alliance leaving the coalition now is not that surprising . 
  i 'm not their voter and can not blame them for leaving but they did leave bit of scent of hypocrisy behind them . 
  for the governing coalition them leaving is not that big deal . 
  they still have clear 112/200 majority and can continue with the reforms pretty safely - it will be even easier now that those guys left the government . 
  but it will be a loss for the sdp - their left wing is now exposed in the coalition which is not good news for their dwindling support . 
  and a challenger has appered for party chairman position . 
  and the future also holds the possibility of the * green league * leaving the governing coalition over the new npp licence . 
  but that would be sometime after the summer and not that relevant now . 
  but other than that the left alliance leaving is not that big deal for the coalition . 
  the public loses two ministers to make fun of but we 'll just have to improvise .
