  and the good side is that with them leaving the coalition goverment has it that much easier to implement needed reforms . 
  without a helmet ? 
  dutch pm living on the edge . 
  or a geographic euphemism ? 
  my sister made fun of a man 's hat once . 
  a m\u00f5\u00f5se bit her . 
   if i remember right , about 3 % of heating is done with gas . 
  only about 10 % of * all * primary energy in finland is from natural gas . 
  it is used in some power plants to produce electricity and district heat , while household gas is rare . 
  100 % of that natural gas is from russia . 
  if for some reason natural gas stopped flowing tomorrow no-one would freeze to death because those power plants can switch over to other fuels although there would be costs in doing that . 
  there are existing plans for such case to arise , and legislation in finland requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time . 
  the national emergency supply agency is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution . 
  there are plans and proposals for a more heterogenous gas supply such as the new lng terminal with estonia , the proposed mid-nordic gas pipeline from norway through sweden to finland , the nordic gas grid and the north transgas project . 
  but all those would be years away . 
   we have to keep the russia happy to not lose our summer bbq . 
  yeah , it 's in a bottle , but still the gas has to come from somewhere . 
  lpg ( liquefied petroleum gas ) or that propane or propane/butane mixture in a bottle is a sideproduct of oil refining . 
  if the natural gas from russia was cut tomorrow no-one 's bbq parties would be ruined . 
  sounds legit . 
   so a new unifying language law was created , * divisive yanukovich did adopt a new language law in 2012 but you can read the links why it was critized as being divisive , not unifying . 
   because crimea was autonomous and ukrainian law does n't apply there ? 
  that law did not , but please note that i said nothing about ukrainian law in general . 
  while some of those are from the bible and common in many languages , i like how we share some of the traditional ones in finnish too . 
   he who brings up the past , will have his eye plucked out -- kes vana asja meelde tuletab , sel silm peast v\u00e4lja * tikulla silm\u00e4\u00e4n , joka vanhoja muistaa .

   the energy cartell are n't cartells illegal in germany ? 
   it really happened . 
  see bbc annotations of putin 's speech . 
  what really , actually happened in reality was : one : in 2012 yanokovich pushes through the ukrainian law on language policy . 
  the new law is adopted illegally and uncostitutionally , and is heavily criticised by human rights watchdogs , academics and scholars , representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided , substandard , and disproportionally favouring one language . 
  the law was [ criticized ] ( http://www.uaba.org/resources/documents/blog%20docs/12-08-23%20amb%20vollebaek%20letter%20to%20ukrainian-am%20%20bar%20assoc_16%20aug.pdf ) by the osce high commissioner on national minorities as its * `` approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society . 
  indeed , the disproportionate favoring of the russian language , while also removing most incentives for learning or using ukrainian in large parts of the country , could potentially undermine ukraine 's very cohesion '' * . 
  he was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with ukrainian constitutional and procedural law . 
  the council of europe stated ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl-ref%282011%29001-e ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl%282011%29101-e ) ) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with european standards . 
  the law was also criticized by ukrainian legal scholars , the national academy of sciences of ukraine and other academic institutions , and numerous ministeries within the yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background . 
  but the law has ** no effect in crimea ** as an autonomus region . 
  nothing changes there because of that law . 
  two : in 2014 about 300 illegally and uncostitutionally adopted laws and acts by yanukovich are to be repealed , and the ukrainian law on language policy is one law among them . 
  but the pm prevents repealing it saying that it 's better to first prepare better language legislation . 
  the law is not repealed and remains in effect . 
  and again , whether the law was repealed or not would have had ** no effect in crimea ** as an autonomus region . 
  nothing would have changed there if the law was repealed - but it was n't . 
  three : but russian state media had already started spreading propaganda lies about it and a myth is born : that the new ukrainian government has created a new language law ( did n't happen ) with purpose of oppressing the russian minority ( did n't happen ) including crimea ( not even applicable ) . 
  and variations of that get repeated in the media . 
   i fail to see the bullshit here . 
  i 'll try explain it again . 
  there was no change in status of any language in crimea which as an autonomus republic it had its own language laws - to claim otherwise is bullshitting . 
  and there was no applicable decision for putin to reverse and him boasting about it is more bullshitting . 
   i do n't know if it 's my bias or what , but russians or russian state apologists on the internet just love that kind of rhetoric . 
  your observation is correct . 
  the soviet era * whataboutism * has been making a comeback in russian state rhetorics and propaganda for some years already : [ the return of whataboutism ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2012/06/the-return-of-whataboutism/ ) what 's surprising is how easily some seem to swallow and then parrot those fallacies . 
  i think you should read a book or two regarding that subject . 
  finlandization was very much akin to what you said ( * `` they kept close ties with the ukranian government '' * ) and was a way of exterting pressure and control over finland . 
   let 's also not forget that the reasons for the soviet invasion of finland are irrelevant now , as they had to do with ideology and nazis . 
  holy shit . 
  til finland had nazis in 1939 and * that 's * why soviet union invaded . 
  the more you learn ...  regarding considerations , i 'd actually say that it matters a good deal . 
  historically it really does n't . 
  because russia would see it challenging its security interests in the region and military buildup is the logical response to it . 
   you 'll find neonazi groups all over europe . 
  * [ and they are lynching negroes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) *, 
   and subsequently lost control of finland for the remainder of the 20th century , [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization )  nothing that would give russia any sense of dependence on where finland lie in the east/west dichotomy . 
  the relevant geography has not changed . 
   they have probably accepted that finland consider themselves western long ago . 
  while i 'm sure they recognize that * finns * consider themselves as western the relevant question to russia is what russia considers . 
  because map . 
  if sweden joined nato it would fundamentally change the security balance in the nordic region . 
  first it would lead to military buildup near our long eastern border and enhanced russian military activity in nordic and baltic sea region . 
  and then finland would have to boost its defence forces etc. 
  it would also lead to the danger of return of the [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) with russia using pressure in finnish politics as from their pov finland would become a small buffer zone between nato and russia . 
  none of which is in finnish interests and joining nato would be the better option in that case - and it would be better apply for it asap . 
  historical precedence : the eu membership and how it happened . 
   realistically , do the finns have anything to worry about ? 
  the eastern neighbour is behaving erratically - repeatedly saying they would not invade and then they invade , using force to annex region in sovereign country despite having assured to uphold its territorial integrity , breaking treaties it has signed recognizing the existing borders in europe etc. 
  as a finn the worrisome thing is that the current russian regime is obviously not to be trusted , the russian state propaganda is publishing lies how finns want to join russia , and we do not know what they 're up to in the future . 
  at the moment i do n't see any immediate military threat , but things have been changing fast lately and situation might be different even in the near future not to say in the longer term . 
  and even if there were no immediate military threat one thing i do not want to make a comeback is [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) . 
   there are no such precedents with finland . 
  finland was an autonomous part of russian empire 1809-1917 . 
  russia had military bases , and later also soviet union had a naval military base in finland . 
   so you are discussing sweden joining nato without taking into the account what the swedes feel about it , what we feel are pros and cons , our opinions ? 
  silverionmox asked ** why ** it 's a `` bad idea '' . 
  all you have said is repeating that it is not a popular idea , which leads to circular reasoning as silverionmox correctly pointed out . 
  hearing those actual pros and cons is what silverionmox asked in the first place .
