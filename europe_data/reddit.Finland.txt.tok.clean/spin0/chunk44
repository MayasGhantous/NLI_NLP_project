  remember , it 's just an opinion poll about an issue which is not actually on the table at the moment . 
  finland and sweden are not planning a military alliance - even if it might have popular support in finland . 
  but there indeed is closer military co-operation in the works , which sounds like smart thing for both of us to do . 
  initiative for that has been going on for quite some time and the defence ministeries in both countries have been working together looking at different options for military co-operation that would benefit both countries . 
  just a couple of weeks ago swedish defence minister karin enstr\u00f6m and her finnish counterpart carl haglund were in finnish tv discussing it and said that the relevant report prepared together will be ready and published in the near future within months . 
  what those options might be are joint procurement of armaments , maintaining techonological and organisational compatibility , joint military exercises , joint air and sea control etc. . . 
  here 's the round table discussion in english with finnish subs - quite interesting : [ security threats in the nordic region ] ( http://areena.yle.fi/tv/2206181 )  the russian occupation of crimea in early march 2014 has heightened public awareness for security in the nordic region , even if scandinavia and the baltic countries are not under immediate military threat . 
  to address the situation , yle hosted a discussion with three defence ministers , ** karin enstr\u00f6m ** of sweden , ** ine eriksen s\u00f8reide ** of norway and ** carl haglund ** of finland . 
  they were joined by undersecretary of state for defence policy ot the estonian government , mr. ** sven sakkov ** . 
  the discussion was recorded at yle studios on march 7th , 2014 , and a shortened version of it was broadcast as part of a larger security debate with finnish parliamentarians on march 12th . 
  this is the complete version of the ministers ' discussion . 
  historically before wwii there were proposals and initiatives for alliance between the nordics and also bilaterally between finland and sweden . 
  but those initiatives were not successful . 
  and especially after the molotov-ribbentrop pact both stalin and hitler opposed such ideas and did everything they could to undermine such initiatives , including threats , as they had other plans for nordic countries . 
  the last effort was after the winter war in 1940 as sweden and finland negotiated and finalized a bilateral defence agreement and were ready to sign it . 
  stalin said he would consider such defence pact a * casus belli * and prepare for war if you sign it , so sweden had to back up from that one at last minute . 
  the future options for sweden and finland are : 1 . 
  both militarily non-aligned in this case co-operation is the smart thing to do . 
  when the report is published we 'll see what that co-operation might cover . 
  a bilateral defence pact at the moment does not seem like an actual option but things might change in the future . 
  both nato members there is no option where sweden joins nato but finland not . 
  if sweden someday applies for nato membership finland has to apply too asap . 
  nato membership does not have popular support in either country but that might change in the future . 
   the last time finns were reminded of the `` unpredictable '' nature of the russian state before this crimean annexation was probably the noottikriisi in 1961 . 
  noottikriisi was the most high profile case but not the last as the soviets continued proposing their ` militarily consultations ' to finland from time to time til the '80s . 
  well , it 's not as if ukrainian workers have n't been cheap labor for russia with about [ 3.5 million ] ( http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html ) ukrainians in 2009 . 
  heck , last year russia even hinted using them as leverage and deporting them if ukraine 's leaders choose to make decisions that go against putin 's will . 
   the minority language bill did pass in parliament , it was then vetoed . 
  so while it did not actually come into effect , i can understand why the fact that it found majority support in the first place and that it was apparently the top priority after the coup might worry russian speakers . 
  the issue was about * repealing an earlier unconstitutional law * : the lopsided ukrainian law on language policy of 2012 pushed forward by yanukovich . 
  the law had been adopted illegally and uncostitutionally . 
  that 's why it was among the 300 or so acts and laws to be repealed for the same reason . 
  but the pm said that despite the law being poor it is still better to keep it in effect until a better law is prepared , and it was not repealed . 
  and the ukrainian law on language policy of 2012 was not a good law to begin with . 
  both the law and its illegal adoption were heavily criticized by relevant watchdogs , scholars , representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided , substandard , and disproportionally favouring one language . 
  in 2012 the law was [ criticized ] ( http://www.uaba.org/resources/documents/blog%20docs/12-08-23%20amb%20vollebaek%20letter%20to%20ukrainian-am%20%20bar%20assoc_16%20aug.pdf ) by the osce high commissioner on national minorities as its * `` approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society . 
  indeed , the disproportionate favoring of the russian language , while also removing most incentives for learning or using ukrainian in large parts of the country , could potentially undermine ukraine 's very cohesion '' * . 
  he was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with ukrainian constitutional and procedural law . 
  the council of europe stated ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl-ref%282011%29001-e ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl%282011%29101-e ) ) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with european standards . 
  the law was also criticized by ukrainian legal scholars , the national academy of sciences of ukraine and other academic institutions , and numerous ministeries within the yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background . 
  framing the non-repealment of that law as some sort of persecution of russian minority is streching it . 
  even more idiotic is to present it as comparable to what happened in kosovo with murder , rape , terror and ethnic cleansing and stuff . 
  not any more . 
  as per 2013 data it 's ** wood ** with its rising share : [ energy year 2013 district heating : wood becomes most important energy source for district heat ] ( http://energia.fi/en/topical-issues/lehdist-tiedotteet/energy-year-2013-district-heating-wood-becomes-most-important-ener )  wood became the most important energy source for district heating in 2013 . 
  finnish energy industries ' ( et ) figures show that the share of wood , wood residue and other indigenous renewable energy sources increased to 29 per cent . 
  when the use of secondary heat from industry is also included in the calculations , the share of carbon-neutral production in district heat generation increased to 31 per cent . 
   -- this is an increase of six percentage points , which is a significant step in district heat operations , says director jari kostama of et . 
  the increased use of biofuels also resulted in reduced carbon dioxide emissions from district heat generation , although the volume of generation , which was smaller than in the previous year , also contributed to the reduction . 
   and significant parts of the district heating is by natural gas in finland ... 
  the most used fuel in producing district heat is wood . 
  gas is used in some power plants to produce electricity and also district heat . 
  only 10 % of * all * primary energy usage in finland is from natural gas . 
  if for some reason natural gas stopped flowing tomorrow no-one would freeze to death because those power plants can switch over to other fuels although there would be costs in doing that . 
   district heating using nuclear is almost unheard of and mostly unfeasible . 
  district heating using hydropower does n't really exist . 
  right , using hydro for district heating would not make much sense . 
  and while npps could be candidates for producing district heat as a side product they are often located too far from population centers for it to be economically feasible , and depending on the reactor type the cooling water often has quite low temperature . 
  but both nuclear and hydro produce electricity which is used for electric heating and about a quarter of housing in finland uses electric heating . 
  therefore in finland heating does use also hydro , nuclear and other means of electricity production . 
  and imagine the next step where rogue service provider hacks your phone to use their service . 
   heating for instance is n't usually done with electricity and therefore does n't really use nuclear or hydropower . 
  yes it is , at least in finland electric heating is the third most common ( 24 % ) heating system , the most common being district heating ( 34 % ) which uses the energy from the otherwise wasted heat of power plants significantly improving their energy efficiency . 
  [ shares as a graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tvtsd5p ) ( [ source data ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/asen/2012/asen_2012_2013-11-13_tau_002_en.html ) ) in new houses the most popular heating systems are ground heat with about half and electric heating with about third of new houses . 
   for finland , a big source of heating in the country overall is actually from gas ( though not the biggest ) . 
  natural gas is only about 10 % of primary energy in finland . 
  used in some powerplants producing electricity and district heat . 
  household gas is rare , and then used for cooking . 
  for those power plants it is possible to replace the natural gas with other energy sources although switching over to other fuels will have some costs . 
  i could n't find the numbers for 2012-13 on hellenic statistical authority 's [ site ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye ) . 
  but they have this xls-table : [ deaths in greece 2000-11 by age and cause ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a1605/other/a1605_spo09_ts_an_00_2000_00_2011_04_f_en.xls ) . 
  [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8653scm ) there appears to be a spike in 2011 . 
  but one can not establish a trend with a single datapoint . 
  more data is needed , and seems that the op is ovestating its case . 
  yes , in finland natural gas is about 10 % of primary energy usage , and 100 % of that gas is from russia . 
  natural gas is used in some powerplants providing electricity and distributed heat . 
  those powerplants would have to switch to other sources of energy ( air-propane mix , biogas , oil , coal etc ) or get compensated by other powerplants . 
  in finland there are [ existing plans ] ( http://www.huoltovarmuus.fi/static/pdf/607.pdf ) for such case to arise , and legislation requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time . 
  the [ national emergency supply agency ] ( http://www.nesa.fi/ ) is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution . 
  basically finland * could * do without russian gas . 
  in case of sudden closure of russian gas pipes no-one would freeze , no-one would die , steel making would not halt as it does n't use gas , but there would be costs in switching over to other energy sources in affected power plants . 
  there are plans and proposals for a more heterogenous gas supply such as the new lng terminal with estonia , the proposed mid-nordic gas pipeline from norway through sweden to finland , the nordic gas grid and the north transgas project . 
  but all those would be years away . 
  relevant recently published peer-reviewed paper on plos : [ resilience of natural gas networks during conflicts , crises and disruptions ] ( http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi%2f10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0090265 )  abstract  human conflict , geopolitical crises , terrorist attacks , and natural disasters can turn large parts of energy distribution networks offline . 
  europe 's current gas supply network is largely dependent on deliveries from russia and north africa , creating vulnerabilities to social and political instabilities . 
  during crises , less delivery may mean greater congestion , as the pipeline network is used in ways it has not been designed for . 
  given the importance of the security of natural gas supply , we develop a model to handle network congestion on various geographical scales . 
  we offer a resilient response strategy to energy shortages and quantify its effectiveness for a variety of relevant scenarios . 
  in essence , europe 's gas supply can be made robust even to major supply disruptions , if a fair distribution strategy is applied . 
   additional information providing historical context to the current situation is also greatly appreciated . 
  brief assessment for historical context : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ) the relevant imf reports are very informative reading : http://www.imf.org/external/country/ukr/index.htm ukraine ranks poorly in the doing business index , also a good read why : http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/ukraine/ [ ppp per capita gdp for comparison ] ( http://i.imgur.com/21db4to.jpg ) [ source with data to play with ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:az:am:by:ee:ge:kz:kg:lv:lt:md:ru:tj:tm:ua:uz&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=699919200000&amp;tend=1362607200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) in short : after 1991 independency the first president leonid kravchuk tried to run the country and its economy like a soviet state with strong presidential powers . 
  mid-1990s privatisations were opaque and the insider deals paved way for super-wealthy oligarchy and monopolies . 
  the second president leonid kuchma continued consolidating presidential powers to himself and postponing reforms . 
  economy continued to stagnate . 
  after 1999 reformist pm viktor yushchenko and his deputy yulia tymoshenko managed to make some modest economic reforms the economy started to see some growth . 
  the side effect was that the oligarchy got richer and even more more powerful . 
  since the indepency ukraine 's politics have been in a constant tug-of-war between strong centralized presidential power and more democratic parliamentary power with related constitutional crises , and another economic tug-of-war between the oligarchs and free market reformists . 
  corruption is a huge problem . 
  using the mere word corruption is perhaps too mild way to put it . 
  if someone thinks that for example spain , greece or romania has problems with corruption , as they do , the situation is and has been worse by magnitudes in ukraine both vertically and horizontally . 
  anything can be fixed with money .
