  i support it . 
  rosatom or not that npp would actually make finland less reliant on russian energy , and also helps in meeting the future co2 targets . 
  and it 's not like an npp has a valve that russian gov could shut down just like that . 
  finland already has two improved soviet npps ( [ & quot ; eastinghouse & quot  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loviisa_nuclear_power_plant ) ) which have been working reliably and producing energy despite the disintegration of the su . 
  in an npp the energy reliance just works differently . 
  regarding nuclear power my biggest gripe is still the sweden 's decision to abandon developing it . 
  those guys were at the forefront in the world developing nuclear power with top science and engineering and their knowhow was topnotch as were their products . 
   i assumed that one needs gas for some industries in some countries for example steel production uses gas . 
  in sweden and finland it uses electricity - lots of it . 
  i think at least in finland , and i assume in sweden too , some chemical industries * may * use natural gas as their raw material . 
  but i do n't think it 's big , and i do n't have the details on that so take with approriate grain of salt . 
   because neighboring finland , which according to the wikipedia article was getting 100 % of its gas from russia , yes , that may seem like a lot but that 100 % is only about 10 % of primary energy in finland . 
  if situation warrants it can be replaced with other energy sources , and no-one over here would freeze to death with sudden disruption of that gas . 
  for more details check my other comment : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20wmqq/reurope_has_there_been_any_serious_discussion_in/cg7i7th, 
   almost the exact opposite , an episode dedicated a significant chunk of airtime to the story of bruno and painted him as a radical skeptic and free-thinker , demanding that others `` question everything '' and saw him burned solely for his cosmological proclamations and implied rationality . 
  * facepalm * for some reason there still seems to be a need to have some sort of martyrs of science even if it is an anti-thesis of science itself . 
  bruno was not a scientist , not even a proto-scientist , and certainly not an astronomer but more of a religious mystic . 
  it just so happened that his version of religious fanaticism was too far from the church 's version . 
  hell , i bet if sagan or neil degrasse tyson were to have a scientific discussion with bruno they 'd burn him themselves - metaphorically speaking of course . 
   can you cite for me that the ` other worlds ' referenced by the bishop of paris were in fact exoplanets and not other bodies within the solar system ? 
  potentially we are missing a key distinction here . 
  regarding the plurality of worlds there was no such distinction . 
  what was condemned in 1277 was teaching that god could have only created one world with life . 
  what you 're now asking for is to have references to centuries of thinking and intellectual tradition . 
  okay , but brace yourself . 
  as apparently nicholas of cusa failed to impress you as a predecessor to bruno have you ever read books by [ johannes hennon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_hennon ) ( 15th cent ) ? 
  and of course his ideas of an infinite number of god created beings on infinite worlds was not original as he merely borrowed from [ albert of saxony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_of_saxony_\\ ( philosopher \\ ) ) ( 14th cent ) . 
  neither of which were burned on stake for proposing such ideas . 
  because , as said , such ideas were not heretical - in fact the absolute opposite was . 
  some other references from relevant scholarly research :  so we find in 1277 ad , only three years after aquinas died , the very blunt condemnation by the bishop of paris , etienne tempier , against a belief `` that the first cause can not make many worlds . '' .

  ) , the interplay between scientific and theological worldviews , part 1 , science & theology 1997 , number 5 , p. 80 ( 1999 ) . 
  *  the assertion that god has at least theoretically the power to create many worlds was common in scholastic literature , especially after bishop etienne tempier 's condemnation in 1277 of the aristotelian thesis `` that the first cause can not make more than one world . '', 
   * harvey , ` nicolas oreseme and hasdai crescas on many worlds ' , in fontain et al ( eds . 
  ) , ` studies in the history of culture and science : a tribute to gad freudenthal ' , p. 354 ( 2011 ) . 
  *  in 1277 there occurred an ironic event that pierre durhem and others have claimed to be a major cause of science . 
  the bishop of paris , etienne tempier , pressed by theologians concerned that philosophers of aristotelian inclination were championing doctrines that could be construed as limiting god 's power , issued a condemnation of 219 such propositions . 
  included in the condemnation was proposition 34 : `` that the first cause can not make many worlds . '', 
  abruptly after 1277 the milieu changed , with many authors formulating analyses aimed at showing god could create multiple worlds . 
  although few urged that god did in fact do so , this process led to a valuable reexamination and critique of aristotle 's antipluralist arguments . 
   * crowe , ` the extraterrestrial life debate , 1750-1900 ' , p. 5 ( 1999 ) . 
  *  bruno 's thinking was influenced by the many-worlds cosmology developed by the greek atomists of the fourth century bce . 
  it also built on the systems of earlier european theological thinkers who either favoured , or left open , the possibility of an infinity of worlds in opposition to the aristotelian view . 
  many highly prominent theologians considered that the principle of the infinity of divine power resonated with the possibility of a multiplicity of worlds . 
  such thinkers included : in the thirteenth century etienee tempier , bishop of paris ; the parisian theologians godfrey of fontaine , henry of ghent , and richard of middleton ; in oxford , the theologians william of ware , jean of bassolos , and thomas of strausbourg ; in the fourteenth century - both jean buridan ( c. 1295-1358 ) , rector of the university of paris and william of ockham ( c. 1280-1347 ) , of oxford ; and in the fifteenth century - the famous theologian-philosopher and cardinal nicolas of cusa ( 1401-1464 ) . 
    nicolas advocated an infinite universe of worlds without a center and merits special note as the first euroepan christian thinker to advocate life on other worlds . 
  his influence on bruno was profound . 
   * harper , ` beginning to explore ' , in herman ( ed . 
  ) , ` god , science , and humility : ten scientists consider humility theology ' , p. 86 ( 2000 ) . 
  * etc. . . 
  there 's plenty of more to find if one picks up and reads books by medieval thinkers themselves or reads what relevant experts on the field have found by reading them - which methods have been beoynd the means of the writers of * cosmos * and * cosmos 2 * . 
  which is kinda bummer , and i hope they 're more accurate with their astronomy than their history . 
   the exoplanet claims were indeed listed . 
  yes but in the context of his version of * salvation * . 
  there was nothing heretical in exoplanets as they had already been accepted to church doctrine since 1277 . 
  in fact as per the condemnations of paris it was unacceptable to teach that god could only have created one planet with life . 
  what was deemed heretical in bruno 's case was his theological teachings regarding * salvation * on exoplanets . 
  it was related to the centuries old question of would the other planets have each their own jesus or would one jesus suffice and if not then would each jesus be a separate entity or part of the same trinity etc. 
  on those points church deemed his teachings heretical - his version of salvation , not the idea of there being exoplanets . 
  there was nothing heretical about the exoplanets per se . 
  exoplanets were a very old idea , and accepted doctrine since 1277 . 
  btw , that was one of the things that the original cosmos got wrong , i like carl sagan and all but he was certainly not a historian , and i hope they have corrected it in the new version . 
  the gas stats are from 2007 . 
  after that russia 's share of natural gas in the eu has been declining while other suppliers such as norway and quatar have been rising . 
  so , has anyone got more up-to-date stats ? 
  in finland natural gas is about 10 % of primary energy usage , and 100 % of that gas is from russia . 
  domestic household gas is rare , used for cooking , and buildings and houses are heated with distributed heating , electricity , oil or others - not directly with natural gas . 
  no one would freeze to death if russian gas pipes were suddenly closed ( and things like electricity exists ! ), 
  but it would have consequenses . 
  natural gas is used in some powerplants providing electricity and distributed heat . 
  those powerplants would have to switch to other sources of energy ( air-propane mix , biogas , oil , coal etc ) or get compensated by other powerplants . 
  in finland there are [ existing plans ] ( http://www.huoltovarmuus.fi/static/pdf/607.pdf ) for such case to arise , and legislation requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time . 
  the [ national emergency supply agency ] ( http://www.nesa.fi/ ) is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution . 
  in case of sudden closure of russian gas pipes no-one would freeze , no-one would die , but there would be some costs in switching over to other energy sources . 
  there are plans and proposals for a more heterogenous gas supply such as the new lng terminal with estonia and the proposed mid-nordic gas pipeline from norway through sweden to finland . 
  i would like to see them both realized as the lng terminal gives a lot of options for supply , and i 'd rather support our nordic bro 's social fund than our eastern neighbour 's military buildup . 
  finland also buys a lot of oil from russia , but the supply channels are already heterogenous and in case of disruptions russia would get replaced by other sources - though there probably would be some costs in doing that . 
  i get your point and agree with it , but just a tiny nitpick : bruno was n't the guy who predicted that as he was merely repeating what others had said long before him . 
  plurality of worlds ( i.e. 
  exoplanets ) goes way back in history and was in fact accepted into catholic church doctrine already in 1277 with the condemnations of paris . 
  already the bishop of paris \u00c9tienne tempier had posited that aristotle was wrong , and there could be more planets with life . 
  this plurality of worlds also became the accepted doctrine , and anti-pluralism was condemned . 
  perhaps the best-known catholic writer to speculate with alien life is german born cardinal nicholas of cusa in his book * de docta ignorantia * , 1440 : [ the man who invented extraterrestrials : nicholas of cusa ] ( http://www.challzine.net/29/29extraterr.html ) a popular myth goes that giordano bruno invented new cosmology and was burned on stake because of that . 
  neither is correct : he did n't come up with any original cosmological ideas which did n't already exist before him , and he was not burned for cosmology but for his theology which was deemed heretical . 
   your comment makes it seem as if crimea had a ukrainian majority that got ethnically cleansed . 
  where did i say that ? 
  perhaps i assumed too much as i thought that pretty much everybody is familiar with the fact that the tatars were ethnically cleansed from the region where they had lived in for several centuries without the need to spell it out in each and every comment . 
  [ the return of whataboutism ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2012/06/the-return-of-whataboutism/ ), 
   even though it 's only part of ukraine since the 1950 's ? 
  ahem : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:carte_de_ukraine_1919.jpg after that ukraine lost both crimea and kouban to the soviet union/russia , but got ethnically cleansed crimea back in 1950 's . 
   one of its chief demands -- that all government business be done in ukrainian -- was passed into law , instantaneously marginalizing the one-third of ukraine 's citizens ( and 60 percent of crimeans ) who speak russian . 
  so much instantaneously wrong in just one sentence . 
  ** firstly ** , there was no such new law . 
  the writers present the whole issue backwards . 
  the issue was about * repealing * an earlier unconstitutional law . 
  which did not happen either . 
  the lopsided * ukrainian law on language policy of 2012 * pushed forward by yanukovich is still in effect . 
  ** secondly ** , the law had been adopted illegally and uncostitutionally . 
  that 's why it was among the 300 or so acts and laws to be repealed for the same reason .
