  but the pm said that despite the law being poor it is still better to keep it in effect until a better law is prepared , and upheld it . 
  ** thirdly ** , the ukrainian law on language policy of 2012 was not a good law to begin with . 
  both the law and its illegal adoption were heavily criticized by relevant watchdogs , scholars , representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided , substandard , and disproportionally favouring one language . 
  in 2012 the law was [ criticized ] ( http://www.uaba.org/resources/documents/blog%20docs/12-08-23%20amb%20vollebaek%20letter%20to%20ukrainian-am%20%20bar%20assoc_16%20aug.pdf ) by the osce high commissioner on national minorities as its * `` approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society . 
  indeed , the disproportionate favoring of the russian language , while also removing most incentives for learning or using ukrainian in large parts of the country , could potentially undermine ukraine 's very cohesion '' * . 
  he was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with ukrainian constitutional and procedural law . 
  the council of europe stated ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl-ref%282011%29001-e ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl%282011%29101-e ) ) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with european standards . 
  the law was also criticized by ukrainian legal scholars , the national academy of sciences of ukraine and other academic institutions , and numerous ministeries within the yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background . 
  ** and finally ** , if repealing a poor law which has been heavily critized by human rights watchdogs and other relevant instances is touted as an example of a ` fascist ' policy the writers are really reaching for the bottom of the barrel for such examples . 
  the reality is that there are no examples of ` fascist ' policies on the new government actions nor on its program . 
  the article reads more like a yellow paper than a serious attempt at analysis . 
  in the midst of all the worryig news from ukraine this was both beautiful and educational piece . 
  so much history on one street . 
  wow such edgy,

  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu .

  yanukovich 's political power started eroding right after he violently attacked the peaceful protesters nov 30 at 04:00 am . 
  he started losing support of gov officials , oligarchs , his party members and his mps right then . 
  and it was all downhill from there on . 
  i agree with you that he was n't weak by february - he was * very * weak . 
  with his political power gone his last attempt was the violent crackdown which failed miserably . 
   russia never signed the deal yup , they did n't . 
  and now russia is crying after that same deal . 
  which they did n't dignify by signing in the first place . 
  they seem to invent this stuff as they go ... 
   we should find a solution with iran . 
  if the us could resist to israel 's bullshit there would be a way . 
  the pipeline project already exists : [ persian pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_pipeline ) from iran to turkey to greece and forward . 
  but the project was halted due to iran trade sanctions , for example a swiss company already had a building contract with iran but dropped it when the us sanctions started 2010 . 
  we 'll see if there 's a project revival . 
  economically the project would look like a nobrainer but the geopolitics creates obstacles , and also russia would like to see it not happening . 
  there 's also a competing project : [ iran-iraq-syria pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran-iraq-syria_pipeline ) from iran and iraq to syria , lebanon and europe . 
  which of course is now impossible with the civil war . 
  another very intersting project is [ qatar-turkey pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qatar-turkey_pipeline ) from quatar to turkey and european markets . 
  quatar originally proposed it to run through syria but assad refused it in order `` to protect the interests of [ its ] russian ally , which is europe 's top supplier of natural gas . '', 
  another proposed route is quatar , saudi-arabia , kuwait , iraq , turkey . 
  then there 's of course the [ nabucco pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucco_pipeline#alternative_projects ) which , despite being pronounced dead many times , still has at least some potential for a revival . 
  russia of course has been doing everything they can to kill it . 
   i really do n't understand russia 's fascination with an agreement that opposition parties signed , and which russia did not even dignify by signing as an observer at the time . 
  pro-russia nationalists marching in crimea and burning history books : https://news.pn/ru/public/94510 http://imgur.com/a/rcwd4 how about this self proclaimed ` people 's governor ' of donetsk - pavel gubarev and his [ russian national unity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_national_unity ) party : http://imgur.com/a/c80jd  russian national unity ( rnu ) or all-russian civic patriotic movement `` russian national unity '' ( russian : \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' ) , is a far right political party and paramilitary organization based in russia and operating in states with russian-speaking populations . 
  also wikileaks cables have some additional interesting tidbits about russia exporting ethnic russian chauvinism : [ the wikileaks cables that anticipated the russian invasion of crimea ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/03/01/the_wikileaks_cables_that_anticipated_the_russian_invasion_of_crimea.html )  however , nearly all contended that pro-russian forces in crimea , acting with funding and direction from moscow , have systematically attempted to increase communal tensions in crimea in the two years since the orange revolution .

  should n't stuff like that need to be accounted for if trying to get a bit of balance ? 
   and crimea is n't a precedent at all . 
  oh but it is a precedent to aspiring nuclear nations like iran and will certainly be reflected there . 
  in exchange of giving up its nuclear arsenal ukraine was given assurances of security and territorial integrity by russia , us and uk . 
  and look what 's happening to those assurances . 
  by the latest [ feb 8-18 opinion poll data by kyiv international institute of sociology ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kiis.com.ua%2f%3flang%3deng%26cat%3dreports&amp;act=url ) about 41 % of crimeans would support union with russia . 
  but i 'm sure any referendum conducted under occupation would be 110 % free and fair and show a huge majority support . 
  generally in ukraine support for uniting with russia has been on a long term downward trend , and it 's a minority opinion even among those ukrainians who identify as ethnic russians . 
  the support is strongest among the communist party and party of regions supporters . 
  and especially the correlation with age is very strong , and support is by far strongest among people over 55 , with very little support from the young . 
  regarding public opinions in crimea here 's some additional interesting tidbits : [ the wikileaks cables that anticipated the russian invasion of crimea ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/03/01/the_wikileaks_cables_that_anticipated_the_russian_invasion_of_crimea.html )  however , nearly all contended that pro-russian forces in crimea , acting with funding and direction from moscow , have systematically attempted to increase communal tensions in crimea in the two years since the orange revolution . 
  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu . 
   first , even putin said that he does n't want crimea to join russia , so thats not gon na happen . 
  i agree with you that putin does not want to annex crimea , as that 's not the best outcome for russia . 
  but unfortunately it could happen even if it is n't his original goal nor the best outcome for anyone . 
  putin said a lot of bullshit but on this point i believe him . 
  russia annexing crimea does not make sense . 
  the region is fully dependend on energy , food and most importantly * water * from ukraine . 
  its important economic activity is tourism . 
  good luck running a tourist resort without water , food , and electricity - never mind how to keep the 1.97 million inhabitants supplied . 
  it would also have added political and ethnic instability , and in a way would be like importing maidan to russia . 
  putin does not want annexed or even independend crimea - both have huge risks of instability which is not what you want where your vital naval base is . 
  also upholding the budapest memorandum is in russia 's interests too - despite russia having breached it on many occasions the territorial integrity of ukraine would be best outcome also for them . 
  crimea is the bargaining chip here . 
  so what does putin want ? 
  he wants to be in position where he can dictate terms to ukraine regarding its western integration . 
  he also wants something much more than bilateral - to be in a position where also the west has to accept his terms . 
  from his pov ukraine simply can not start western integration without his terms included from the beginning . 
  all his previous efforts backfired . 
  on its own volition ukraine would not join putins club of dictators in customs union , and with the association agreement ukraine 's path towards western integration would get started without putin 's terms in it . 
  the whole project he had been running over a decade has crumbled ( and probably his future eurasian union plan ) . 
  and now all he has left is military invasion . 
  putin would rather have crimea remaining as autonomous part of ukraine . 
  but only with his terms . 
  and having invaded and occupied it he is in a better position to dictate his terms . 
  eventually his demands might look something like this : 0 . 
  crimea stays as autonomous part of ukraine , but with added locally established ethnic russian military bodies 1 . 
  russia 's military bases remain in crimea perhaps with new bases and additions such as the claimed bridge . 
  ukraine agrees to stay militarily non-aligned and never to join nato , perhaps with a guarantee from the west . 
  ukraine and the west agree never to deploy certain types of military systems on the ukrainian territory ( such as certain types of missiles , radars and anti-missile defences ) . 
  ukrainian defence forces are only allowed certain types and numbers of armament , and some types will be banned/restricted . 
  he wants ukraine and the west to agree to them . 
  for some terms a bilateral agreement with ukraine may not be enough and he wants it multipartial . 
  then he would stop the military invasion and withdraw his occupying troops and sign crimea back to ukraine . 
  his puppet pm in crimea is a fully disposable clown , and referendum is just for posture . 
  but the problem is : all this could happen only with very good diplomacy and negotiation . 
  and there 's a big possibility for the west , ukraine and russia to fuck this up . 
  then putin 's plan b is to keep it - not what he originally wanted and not the best outcome for anyone . 
  the data is bit old . 
  for example russia is not the top supplier of gas to the eu - norway is . 
  also quatar 's share has has been rising fast . 
  that is not to say that russia is n't important supplier - it is . 
  and probably also `` stop the war '' group - not sure what other explanation there is for this : [ fisking `` stop the war '' ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/britain-and-ukraine ), 
  yep , one of the most profound divisions in ukraine regarding west/east alignment is * generational * and it 's very distinct in all relevant polls , for example in [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/turo7c9 ) it is also apparent in the latest [ feb 8-18 opinion poll data by kyiv international institute of sociology ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kiis.com.ua%2f%3flang%3deng%26cat%3dreports&amp;act=url ) . 
  generally in ukraine support for uniting with russia has been on a long term downward trend , and it 's a minority opinion even among those ukrainians who identify as ethnic russians .
