  actually the imf recommends reforming the gas subsidies with accompanied measures to protect the most vulnerable households . 
   this is precisely one of the reason why yanukovich won the election . 
  then apparently his voters have been misinformed . 
  he probably did n't say that he and his pals are going to steal the gas subsidies either , did he ? 
   russia 's loan is much better than the imf , you 're just speculating . 
  [ the russian loan deal is gone ] ( http://www.ise.ie/app/announcementdetails.aspx?id=11871306 ) . 
  when there was a loan deal with russia that loan had higher interest rate ( 5 % ) than the imf loan ( 2-3 % ) . 
  and that loan had unfavourable conditions as [ russia could call in ukraine 's loans anytime it wanted ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/183432.html ) . 
  with that putin would have had even more leverage on independend ukraine by calling off the loans and demanding repayment at will : do something against putin 's will , face instant default . 
   i 'll say imf is a very bad choice . 
  implementing those reforms would be good for ukraine , good for civil society , good for democracy , good for the people , good for the economy , business enviroment and investment etc - but they all were poison to corrupt yanykovich and ` family ' of oligarchs running the country and its economy . 
  in order to keep on stealing billions of ukrainian taxpayer 's money they chose the more expensive loan from russia with awful terms . 
  imf loan for funding has been on the offering for months . 
  but yanukovich dropped that and chose the more expensive loan deal with russia because imf had conditions such as : `` we recommend a focus on structural reforms that would address the most binding constraints to growth . 
  this includes ** revamping the judicial system , simplifying or repealing burdensome government regulations , stepping up anti-corruption measures , and enforcing clear and consistent rules in tax administration . 
  ** decisive progress in these areas should raise productivity and investment , substantially lifting potential growth in the medium term . '', 
  all big red flags to the oligarchy . 
  imf also wanted changes in the way the generous gas subsidies were handled , which was a big no-no to yanukovich & oligarchs who have been stealing those . 
  if there 's a loan offering from the imf why would there be need for a eu loan ? 
  i think the eu could and should help in other ways for example within the eastern partnership program and through the european investment bank . 
  this just in : #tymoshenko is free from now !, 
  verkhovna rada has adopted appropriate decree ( 322 votes ) [ @euromaidanpr ] ( https://twitter.com/euromaidanpr/status/437188682760876032 ), 
  yes , he signed the agreement already yesterday . 
  it 's the parliament 's bills from yesterday that are currently in need of president 's signature . 
  as yanukovich is nowhere to be found his advisor hanna herman has said to sign them . 
  do n't know if that 's actually going to happen . 
  perhaps the parliament has to appoint an acting president ? 
  according to @euromaidanpr protestors have entered yanukovich 's abandoned private mansion mezhygirja : https://twitter.com/euromaidanpr/status/437152392237555712 edit : live stream from there : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qes1fnpn40e, 
  ukrainian parliament has opened today 's plenary . 
  first , the chairman rybak ( party of thieves ) and deputy chairman kaletnyk ( communist ) resigned . 
  proposal to impeach yanukovich under discussion . 
  klitschko says new presidential elections must happen before 25 may 2014 . 
  watch history in the making , live streams : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_lfrmcoem4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qes1fnpn40e, 
  as i understand it they 'll probably vote about it in the next sitting starting sat morning at 10:00 . 
  the protestors have said to march over there if yanukovich has n't resigned by then . 
  let 's hope there will be no further violence . 
   parliament voted to free ex-prime minister yulia tymoshenko from prison by decriminalizing the article in the criminal procedural code under which she was convicted . 
   a constitutional majority of 310 lawmakers from a cross-section of different parties , including the communists , voted for the measure . 
  yanukovych is widely blamed for ordering the imprisonment of his political rival . 
   taras berezovets , director of political consutancy berta communications , said that the legislation requires the signature of president viktor yanukovych before tymoshenko can be released , and that he has up to 15 days to sign it . 
   there 's romance in the air .

  and here we have both . 
  the trouble is you do n't even know this is unacceptable behavior . 
  negotiations with a liar are impossible . 
  you claim that people are taking over government agencies . 
  no , they are liberating them from criminals , from the overseers , from those who do harm to the ukrainian nation with their theft , falsehood , injustice , and now open murder . 
  the honest government officials are moving to the side of the people . 
    what can i advise ? 
  you became the head of state and did not become a successful businessman . 
  a different kind of talent is required . 
  you became a parasite on the national body . 
  a huge parasite . 
  a parasite is pulled off when it does not fall off by itself . 
  but you did do one great service for society . 
  being consistent as a real criminal , you gave birth to a true alternative to yourself -- people of honor and conscience that you did not know existed . 
  i pity you . 
  wake up viktor . 
  another ukraine is outside the window . 
  resign !, 
  that 's not a sniper rifle and not a firearm . 
  it 's an air rifle . 
   it was my impression that the berkut were a militia used primarily for crowd control , etc. 
  i 'm just going off the brief videos i have seen . 
  [ berkut is police special forces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berkut_%28ukraine%29 ) usually wearing grey camo uniforms with text \u0411\u0415\u0420\u041a\u0423\u0422 ( berkut ) on their back . 
  militia ( kinda national guard ) are the guys in black uniforms with epolets , usually with shields and black helmets . 
  berkut has been mostly using them as a barrier between the protestors and themselves . 
  usually they have had the militia standig ground at the front while the berkut stands further away behind them in relative safety shooting from there . 
   hopefully not all the protesters follow that line . 
  certainly not : [ jewish ukrainian maidan self-defense leader : at the end of the day , living in this country has been worth it -- because we 've lived to see the maidan . 
  ] ( http://maidantranslations.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/maidan-self-defense-leader-at-the-end-of-the-day-living-in-this-country-has-been-worth-it-because-weve-lived-to-see-the-maidan/ ) some tend to oversimplify the euromaidan as facist/nazist program platform which it is obviously not . 
  as gensek puts it well [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1yfik5/medic_gets_shot_by_sniper_in_kyiv/cfk5a1e ) it 's mostly because some people are wired to see fascists everywhere as the eternal other against us - and the progandists use that as much they can . 
  i do n't think so , i 've seen plenty of old ladies in the images and videos . 
  and while they 're not as numerous as younger people i would n't call that an exception . 
   if you remember the beginning of protests , it was protesters who beat the shit out of officers while they stood idle . 
  sorry , you 've gotten it wrong . 
  the ball of violence got rolling 30 november at 4:00 am when the berkut special police forces violently attacked completely peaceful protesters at maidan nezalezhnosti . 
  the berkut used batons , stun grenades and tear gas . 
  79 people was injured including journalists with cameras . 
  later the police claimed they did it because of the need to put up christmas decorations on the maidan . 
  that violent raid led to huge mass protests . 
   so someone say kill these people or we kill you . 
  someone has said them that ? 
  [ citation needed ], 
   somewhere between imprisonment and execution depending on the situation . 
  [ citation needed ] these are special police forces suppressing protests , not a military in a war . 
  i do n't think a berkut guy would get sentenced to death for not shooting civilians . 
   btw : radiosvobodan is as much propaganda as rt.com . 
  you should alway read sources from both sides before you make up your opinion . 
  the link is not to * any * news site . 
  it 's a webshop . 
  surely you can find other webshops if you need a second opinion on the availability of cheap paintball gun and airguns replicas . 
   but the one with the pistol clearly uses a firearm with live rounds . 
  yeah , and that 's the first one i 've seen . 
  so far what i 've seen in the photos and videos have not been firearms . 
  so this is rare , and a new development . 
  does n't look like kyiv though .
