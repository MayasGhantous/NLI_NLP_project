  when in doubt here 's some rules of thumb to keep you safer : * flagging a taxi may risk getting ripped off in some cities . 
  often ordering a proper taxi with the help of tourist information/hotel is less risky . 
  * ask for a price estimate beforehand , and keep an eye on the meter . 
  does n't prevent inflated tourist prices but makes * surprise rip-off * prices less likely . 
  * if the driver asks for a ridiculous price and then intimitades or threatens you , keep calm and remember that he really does not want trouble with authorities . 
  * do not just step into a taxi and ask the driver to take you somewhere to * ` have a good time - wink , wink ' * . 
  in some cities the driver may take you to a place where : 1 ) you will get seriously ripped off , 2 ) you will not have good time but possibly get threatened , and 3 ) the return trip will cost much more . 
  in such cases the driver and the place are working together to both rip you off . 
   would like to have you opinion guys , will the swastika ever be seen as something else than nazi symbolism ever again ? 
  i think * the * swastika will be seen as a nazi symbol for a long time in many countries in europe , assuming by * the * swastika you mean [ the swastika nazis used ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#mediaviewer/file:flag_of_german_reich_%281935%e2%80%931945%29.svg ) as their symbol . 
  but i 'm not sure if that will apply similarily to * any * swastika in the long run . 
  and if you look at it globally , swastikas as symbols have different connotations depending on who ask . 
  and at least here in finland the finnish air force had a swastika as a symbol well before the nazis and it has remained as one of the symbols in use , e.g. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/training_air_wing,_finnish_air_force there 's also a swastika in some of the finnish official decorations such as [ the i class of the order of the cross of liberty for peacetime merits ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/grootkruis_en_ster_vredesklasse_van_het_vrijheidskruis.jpg ) and a swastika also appears in [ the presidential standard of finland . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/presidential_standard_of_finland.svg ) and of course , none of them is the nazi swastika , and their origins have no relation to nazis but are from times well before them . 
  not just any swastika is the nazi swastika , and a swastika does not equal to nazi for everyone . 
  imagine if the nazis had chosen a some kind of circle as their symbol . 
  would all circles be nazi ever since , everywhere ?

  [ meanwhile on the market ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oai1er5.png ) ruble just hit a new low : [ ruble drops 2nd day as interventions fail to offset s & amp ;p concern ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-23/ruble-drops-2nd-day-as-interventions-fail-to-offset-s-p-concern.html ) and stocks fall : [ russian stock index drops as ukraine tensions are reignited ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-22/micex-drops-as-ukraine-tension-reignited-russia-reality-check.html ) and oil prices remain lowest in five years : http://www.quotenet.com/commodities/oil-price/usd?type=brent, 
   there is no way such a term could be implemented . 
  gas is a commodity . 
  they do exist in some gazprom contracts . 
  but such clauses restricting gas resales are probably illegal in the eu , and there is an ongoing antitrust case regarding them : [ antitrust : commission opens proceedings against gazprom ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-937_en.htm?locale=fr ) ( 04/09/2012 ) in addition to gazprom 's resale clauses the case also covers its monopolistic pricing behavior and clauses restricting gas flows ( e.g. 
  reverse flow ) .

   russia really could use a better image right now or something positive/not hostile coming from russian government would be a nice change of pace . 
  apparently not even [ alexey gromov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexey_gromov ) can provide such image enhancement any more . 
   maaaaaybe future possibilities of diversifying our nat.gas / oil trade routes somewhere apart from europe , thus when europe moves away from russian energy sources little by little ( strengthening their negotiation position in result ) russia could also have some other place to sell ( eventually doing the same ) . 
  yes , by 2020s russia will likely export more energy and more of its resource commodities to china . 
  but the thing is those exports wo n't replace the volumes ( and probably not prices ) exported to the eu and especially volume of the energy ( oil , natural gas ) exported to china will remain a fraction of what is currently exported to the eu . 
  and the other very important thing of note is china 's long term strategy : china will never choose to import a major fraction of its energy sources from russia and risk becoming dependend in the process . 
  they already have the eu as a warning example , and china 's long term strategy has always been to hedge its bets and to diversify as exemplified by [ this graph . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1am18b6.jpg ) despite their propagandist rhetorics the biggest external mid-to-long term threat to the oligarchy currently ruling russia is not nato , it 's the eu energy union . 
   has the eu got enough money to aid the development of another poor nation ? 
  the aid provided and promised so far , albeit substantial , is peanuts to the eu . 
  the real question is can ukraine itself 1 ) have stability against russia 's destabilization efforts , and 2 ) to progress with its societal , judicial , anti-corruption and economic reforms to entice further investement from the private sector . 
  ukraine has huge potential . 
  for basic background reading i recommend this concise asessment of the societal and economic developments in ukraine since the independency until early 2013 : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ) ( even reading the timeline part is informative ), 
  can what afford what ? 
  contrary to the often repeated misinformation neither the communist party nor the pro-russian opposition block are banned , they 're just very unpopular . 
  a concise commentary by andrew wilson for the ecfr : [ who are the contenders in the ukraine elections ? 
  ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_who_are_the_contenders_in_the_ukraine_elections332 ) he has also written a recently published book [ ukraine crisis : what it means for the west ] ( http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780300211597 ) ( yale university press , 2014 ) , but i have n't read it yet .

  it 's slowly rotating towards earth and will remain visible for next 9-10 days . 
  the group 's messy magnetic field has a complex ( beta-gamma-delta ) structure which means strong flares are possible . 
  and if those flares happen to cause coronal mass ejections directed to earth we may get big time aurora activity .

  but they do have one mep . 
  just linked their editorial for lel . 
  swedish defence forces presser just started , live stream : http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/ubatsjakten-i-skargarden/, 
  but according to swedish [ feminist initiative ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feminist_initiative_ ( sweden \\ ) ) party apparently spending on submarinehunts is an `` outdated patriarchal policy '' . 
  my sides after reading this : [ julafton f\u00f6r patriarkala f\u00f6rsvarsromantiker ] ( http://www.expressen.se/debatt/julafton-for-patriarkala-forsvarsromantiker/ ), 
   some parts of south eastern russia have historically been chinese , and the chinese state media has pointed this out on several occasions as well as refering to russias annextion of crimea . 
  yup . 
  also , some months ago , during the crimean pseudo-referendum , this was happening in chinese social media : [ netizens compare lost chinese territory to crimea crisis ] ( http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/netizens-compares-lost-chinese-territory-to-the-crisis-in-crimea.html ) those chinese netizens did n't seem to be too happy about how the red army occupied and annexed large regions of china using pseudo-referendums :  the russia that has never done any good ; if it 's not destroyed , then there is no justice in the world . 
  so , if we were to follow putin 's ideas through , and go by his silly principle of what has ` historically belonged ' to where , russia would become quite a bit smaller . 
  almost all of russias neighbors have clay in russia that has historically belonged to them . 
  apparently the exponent depends on age . 
  in most countries there is a relationship between age and happiness forming a u-shaped curve , with a low point at roughly age 40 around the world : [ like this ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/blogs/2014/03/28%20happiness%20economic%20employment%20graham/ageoverall.png ) otoh in russia , well : [ the data are in : life under putin is a continuous downward spiral into despair ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/01/the-data-are-in-life-under-putin-is-a-continuous-downward-spiral-into-despair/ ),

   riiight , nobody speaks english in russia . 
  only about 5.5 % as per the 2010 census : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population, 
   the buildup to war actually began as early as 2008 , according to sikorski . 
  he says russian intentions were becoming transparent by the time of the 2008 nato summit in bucharest . 
  `` this is where [ putin ] gave his extraordinary speech saying ukraine was an artificial country and the greater part of these lands historically belonged to russia . '' at the summit the kremlin warned it would respond militarily to moves by ukraine or georgia to join the nato alliance : months later russian forces seized on a provocation from tbilisi and invaded georgia . 
  yep , the signs of long planned operation have been there .

  ] ( https://cablegatesearch.wikileaks.org/cable.php?id=06kyiv4489&amp;amp;q=crimea ) according to the leaked cable already by then moscow was running , funding and fanning russian nationalism and ethnic chauvinism in crimea in order to destabilise ukraine :  however , nearly all contended that pro-russian forces in crimea , acting with funding and direction from moscow , have systematically attempted to increase communal tensions in crimea in the two years since the orange revolution . 
  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu .

   they probably came up with the story because a dutch navy submarine and three other vessels are visiting tallinn right now . 
  yes , they were in tallinn but left yesterday . 
  over a week ago the dutch vessels participated in joint exercise in sweden , after that they left stockholm oct 13th , arrived outside tallinn oct 17th , participated in operations ( drills ? ), 
  near naissaar , and left tallinn yesterday morning .

  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0uds3_iyaau_c3.jpg ) not sure if their mission is to follow professor logachev or if it 's merely a coincidence . 
  professor logachev is one of the ships of interest which may or may not be related to the current events , we do n't know . 
  the ship has capabilities to work with mini submarines , [ has an array of relevant instruments , and also a heavy cargo boom for rov operation with lift capacity of 16 tons . 
  ] ( http://www.soundocean.com/cgge/rv-professor-logachev ) she left st.petersburg oct 18 @ 13:03 utc and visited kronstadt , and yesterday she was heading west in the gulf of finland with las palmas as stated destination . 
  the timing of its sailing might be related , or might be a coincidence , we do n't know . 
   other than being a submarine , there is no relation to the event in sweden . 
  indeed . 
  the foreign vessel they 're currently searching for is certainly not the dutch submarine which visited sweden a week ago . 
  but in a way the foreing underwater activity in sweden may be related to the earlier joint exercise . 
  it 's possible a foreing vessel may have entered there to gather intelligence during the exercise , but for some reason has remained after the exercise was over . 
  russian military says * that * now ?
