  where is the video from ? 
  and what is he shooting at aiming up like that ? 
  and why are there bullet holes around those guys ? 
  have they been shot at ? 
  from somewhere above ? 
  here 's a different and more in depth perspective . 
  [ jewish ukrainian maidan self-defense leader : at the end of the day , living in this country has been worth it -- because we 've lived to see the maidan . 
  ] ( http://maidantranslations.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/maidan-self-defense-leader-at-the-end-of-the-day-living-in-this-country-has-been-worth-it-because-weve-lived-to-see-the-maidan/ ), 
   btw : i found this video linked on rt.com . 
  so it might be biased . 
  that pretty much sums it up . 
  why did n't you mention in your headline that it 's actually ** an airgun ** and not a firearm ? 
  probably because putin today did n't tell you . 
  there has been pictures and videos of protestors with paintball and air guns , and they 're easy to obtain ( see this [ webshop ] ( http://rozetka.com.ua/search/?section=%2f&amp;text=%d0%9f%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5+%d0%bf%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%8b ) ) . 
  for example because the killers have been using special slugs custom made for berkut . 
  [ these ] ( http://merera.livejournal.com/295325.html ) killed people already four weeks ago . 
  only ukraine 's police special force has them . 
  we also know the berkut has been using live ammo already four weeks ago , bacause of the bullets dug out from people 's flesh and shell casings found in berkut positions . 
  and now you can see video 's how berkut is shooting at crowds with akm assault rifles . 
  as it 's an automatic weapon they 're not using rubber bullets . 
   there are multiple photos showing the ` protesters ' with weapons even before the government decided to truly crack down on them with violence . 
  and none were shown to depict an actual firearm . 
  i 've mostly seen airgun and paintball gun replicas , which are cheap and easily available for example in the [ webshops . 
  ] ( http://rozetka.com.ua/search/?section=%2f&amp;text=%d0%9f%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5+%d0%bf%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%8b ) so far photos do n't mean much . 
  it may be possible that the protesters have taken to actual firearms after the earlier berkut attacks . 
  but if you want to assess the prevalency of real firearms among the protesters you have to look at their possible effect : how many berkut has actually gotten shot . 
  so far it seems that the ones using actual firearms with live ammo has been the berkut and the tituskhi shooting to kill . 
  but that may have changed today if the protesters are arming themselves as you claim . 
  besides , the berkut has been shooting to kill already four weeks ago killing and wounding protesters by firing both live ammo and [ special slugs designed to break doors and stop vehicles ] ( http://merera.livejournal.com/295325.html ) . 
  looks like yanukovich 's operation to violently mop up the maidan is n't working as planned . 
  he was probably betting on a quick operation , but people there are determined to resist and instead of scaring people out more people have come . 
  this may become another defeat for yanukovich . 
  right now people need to hold on the maidan until the morning , and tomorrow yanukovich has to face the backlash of the bloodbath - and hopefully on international scale as some western officials have already said they hold yanukovich solely responsible . 
  / r/ukraine has an informative live update post going : [ ukraine protests discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1y8fdv/ukraine_protests_discussion/ ), 
   ah sanctions , yee old legal collective punishment . 
  like the elites even suffer . . 
  it 's not about across the board sanctions on the ukraine 's economy but targeted to specific persons . 
  as corruption is rampant in ukraine oligarchs and officials have accumulated huge personal wealth ( combined wealth of 50 richest equals to about half of country 's gdp ) . 
  and with the wealth and corruption the ` family ' of oligarchs has huge political influence in ukraine . 
  they have a lot to lose with targeted sanctions such as visa restrictions and freezing their foreign bank accounts . 
  as an example austrian paper format has an article on how president yanukovych and his cronies manage their assets via austria : [ millionen-gr\u00fc\u00dfe aus kiew ] ( http://www.format.at/articles/1405/931/372187/millionen-gruesse-kiew ) the complex ownership schemes as [ infographic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/flzi4u2 ), 
   what 's to stop the swiss from retaliating with high tariffs for transit goods through their territory . 
  a quick look at a map ? 
  indeed . 
  but there might be some nuts to crack in possible negotiations , such as : schengen or not schengen ? 
  euro or opt-out ? 
  reaching deals regarding cfp and cap ? 
  while those might become hard-to-solve issues i do n't think they would become obstacles that would take years to negotiate , and all in all i 'd expect negotiations to proceed quickly . 
   if you think that former bilateral agreements were a present to switzerland and that the eu did n't get a lot of benefits from those deals , you 're very mistaken . 
  he did n't say such . 
  and vague strawman instead of an actual informed answer does not clarify the issue at all . 
  why do n't you take time to ponder his actual question :  what leverage does swiss have to make them able to renegotiate the treaty in their favor ? 
  i 'd say very little . 
  but how do you see it : what leverage does switzerland actually have to get a new treaty in their favour ? 
  what is it ? 
  and further : you seem to believe there could be renegotiations of a set of treaties ` from scratch ' . 
  but even before the referendum eu 's position has been to consolidate those separate treaties into a single treaty . 
  do you believe the eu would renegotiate a new set of separate treaties with switzerland ? 
  and if so , why ? 
  there 's a similar trend in latvia : emigration is slowing while immigration is growing , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sux59nf ), 
   iceland officially applied to the eu in june 2009 . 
  in 2013 , when the bid was dropped , it had completed about a third of the negotiations . 
  so if the letter of the law is followed , scotland might join the eu just before serbia , several years from now . 
  there 's nothing in the ` letter of law ' that says negotiations has to last a minimum amount of years . 
  and for example finland 's membership negotiations started february 1993 and were already completed by march 1994 - in 13 months . 
   i have no idea if these two numbers are comparable though . 
  as explosions go they 're not even nearly comparable . 
  what makes an atomic bomb so devastating is the fact that all the energy is released in a split second within a small volume ( of air , as it 's the radiation heated expanding air that creates the blast ) . 
  had hiroshima bomb relesed its energy in say 48 hours on an area of several square kilometers it would n't have been much of an explosion . 
  an lng tanker simply can not release all its energy in an split second explosion . 
  the lng needs to be in a gaseous phase to combust , it needs oxygen to combust , and it needs a right mixture of gas and air ( oxygen ) to combust , which conditions are not present to create such explosion of an lng tanker . 
  his claim :  the total energy released in the event of a liquefied natural gas tanker exploding would be as powerful as 50 atomic bombs , an engineer claimed yesterday . 
  is incorrect , misleading and uninformed . 
  there 's simply no way an lng tanker could do what he claims and release all its energy as a huge explosion . 
  because of how combustion works several conditions are needed to have a gas explosion - such as gaseous phase , oxygen and favourable mixture . 
  gas explosions may occur when those conditions are met for example due to an undetected leak in a pipeline . 
  as misleading comparisons go i remember when the space shuttle challenger disaster happened media was at first eager to compare it to an atomic bomb , with some saying that as the fuel tank contained a huge amount of energy it was comparable to hiroshima . 
  yet that was not what happened at all . 
  as anyone can see in the images , the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen did combust in a fireball but obviously not exploding like an atomic bomb , and the shuttle itself did not explode or break because of an explosion ( aerodynamic loads tore it apart ) . 
   it 's not like that has suddenly changed . 
  indeed . 
  it 's not like we have invented new improved methods to ensure the meat we consume is safe to eat . 
  sedated = / = stunned i wish people would stop confusing those . 
  actually the term ` ritual slaughter ' is what the linked jerusalem post article uses . 
  if you have objections to it perhaps you should take it to the paper in question . 
  the operative word being ` imagine ' , the commission has no actual power over how national governments vote , and barroso is certainly not in a position to set or even claim such policy . 
  so , whatever he says on a matter he has no authority over is merely stating a personal opinion , and while apparently speculating on it he can not dictate even spanish government 's vote . 
  and , as it happens , his opinion is contrary to the spanish government 's stated position . 
   i thought islam did n't want stunning either ? 
  halal requires the animal being alive before butchering . 
  stunning prior to slitting animal 's throat is acceptable , and indeed widely practiced in many countries . 
  for example in malaysian or indonesian ` halal rules ' animal can be stunned with electrical , mechanical or pneumatic stunner . 
  you may find some muslims who for some reason oppose stunning by claiming for example that stunning kills the animal , or that the act of stunning itself causes more pain and suffering to the animal than slitting its troat and letting it bleed to death in agony . 
  but the fact is that ` not stunned ' is not a requirement for halal , and for example in denmark and also in finland muslims butcher stunned animals just as the local animal welfare laws require . 
   how does bringing their own priest help ? 
  there 's actually not a ` priest ' present ( and , btw , islam has no priests ) . 
  the slitting has to be made in a certain quick way , and the person has to be a muslim saying the magic words when doing it . 
   but it is hard to separate the person and the commissioner . 
  in this case it 's not difficult . 
  as he has no authority to set a policy on what he says it is merely voicing his personal opinion .
