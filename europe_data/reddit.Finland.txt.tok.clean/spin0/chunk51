  what exactly is the power and influence he holds on the issue as european commission president ? 
  but it 's for a good cause : [ finnish booze rally helps fund estonian literature ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_booze_rally_helps_fund_estonian_literature/6784639 ), 
   i mean , i know that some of finland 's problems are due to nokia , some are because of the euro - what is the cause of denmark 's problems ? 
  both of which are not primary causes for finland 's economic problems . 
  the biggest single cause is the structure of finland 's export industry : it 's more investment driven , less consumer driven and less heterogenous than for example sweden 's exports . 
  which means exports wo n't grow right after recession when consumption starts growing again , but only later on when the industries producing consumer products start investing to new production .

  would be interesting to see comparisons with more recent figures . 
  and so say we all . 
   comparing gernika or dresden to it , it simply seems unimpressive . 
  the actual damage caused to helsinki was indeed relatively low , but the soviet bombing raids were simply massive . 
  just for sense of scale here 's a comparison of helsinki bombing raids with dresden bombing raids in three days of 13-15 feb 1945 . 
  helsinki dresden total sorties : 2100 1320 bombers per raid : 400-900 highest 800 ( feb 13 . ), 
  bombs dropped : 2600 tons 3900 tons deaths : 151 at least 40000 buildings destroyed :109 85 % or 15 km ^ 2 destroyed now , as a comparison that is not fair as we 're talking about different cities in different circumstances , and helsinki was not similar to dresden . 
  but what it shows is the scale of the bombing raids and what kind of devastation helsinki air defence managed to fend off . 
   comparing the pictures to the bombing of my city by the brits , the fins got away pretty lucky . 
  i mean you can even still see the building ... 
  yes , the damage to helsinki was indeed relatively light compared to what the soviets supposed it to be . 
  their purpose had been to destroy the city with massive consecutive bombing raids . 
  yet the worst was n't avoided by luck . 
  saving helsinki is a story of its own , and it was done by smart air defence and well placed deception , with the added help of poor soviet performance . 
  ** before ** the soviets had bombed helsinki several times through the wars , and at the beginning of the winter war the soviets bombed helsinki without even declaring a war taking the city by a surprise . 
  since then helsinki 's air defence had been developed to better cope with soviet bombings . 
  but the three great 1944 bombing raids were in a league of their own by their magnitude . 
  at the 1943 teheran conference stalin had gained allied approval for attacking helsinki with massive bombings . 
  the planning to destroy helsinki was started december 1943 in add ( avyatsya dalnevo deystviya ) , an elite bomber force directly under the soviet high command including stalin , and the operation was led by air marshall a. golovanov . 
  the soviets launched three massive night bombing raids with a total of about 2100 sorties and 16500 bombs up to 5000 kg with a total of 2600 tons . 
  the raids happened on the nights of 1944 february 6 -- 7 , 16-17 and 26-27 ( < - see a pattern there ? 
  yeah , soviet high-command at work , `` we shall make surprise night attacks every ten days ! '' ) . 
  meanwhile in helsinki the air defence was commanded by lt col pekka jokipaltio . 
  he was a pretty smart guy and had been developing and improving the air defences for years . 
  his idea of successful air defence was minimizing the damage , not inflicting maximal losses to the bomber force . 
  therefore instead of concentrating on shooting the bombers down , his air defence put priority on preventing the bomb loads getting to their targets . 
  in that thinking a bomber without a bomb load was not a threat and no need to waste ammo on . 
  and instead of shooting planes down the air defence 's main goal was to scare and distract the bombers from reaching their targets , and to have them drop their bomb loads either prematurely or somewhere else . 
  after a bomber had been seen dropping its bomb load or turning away it was not a target any more . 
  for that purpose he implemented the paradigm of pre-planned barrage fire . 
  pentti paatero divided the airspace around helsinki into defensive rings up to 14 km in radius and each ring into about 1-1 .5 km wide arcs . 
  those columns were further divided into 200 m high slices up to 7.5 km altitude . 
  each slice of airspace was given an id number , gunnery data was precalculated for each , and the anti-aircraft batteries were trained to quickly target them by the id numbers . 
  in 1943 finland had been able to buy german radars which were an important addition to the air defence system . 
  helsinki had about 70 heavy anti-aircraft guns and about 40 light guns organized into four heavy batteries and some smaller ones around the city . 
  a single fire barrage to a precalculated target consisted of four shells from each gun in one battery . 
  the fire barrages were concentrated in front of approaching bombers in order to make them turn away from their path towards target , and to scare and distract them to drop their bomb loads prematurely . 
  for added effect some of the aa shells were jury-rigged with magnesium and aluminium powder to create extra bright and scary flashes . 
  ** the great bombing raids of helsinki ** * the first raid 6-7 feb 1944 * while finnish radio intelligence had noted the growing soviet radio activity and concluded that a bombing raid was likely , the scale of the attack was unexpected and unprecended . 
  the first raid came as a surprise especially to the civilian population . 
  the soviets attacked with 785 bombers dropping 6991 bombs or about 1100 tons . 
  yet the air defence was successful and by far most of the bombs ended up into sea and areas around the city . 
  only about 280 bombs hit the city ( ~ 4 % ) . 
  deaths : 105 ( 3 military ) buildings destroyed : 28 bombers destroyed : 13 some of the bomber flight paths on a [ radar map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d7tpk4e ) the grey striped area is city center , most of the bombs were dropped into sea before reaching target . 
  after the raid a german night fighter group 1 . / jg 302 with 12 messerschmitt bf 109g-6 night fighters was sent from estonian front to helsinki to assist in city 's defence . 
  they shot down four bombers in the following two raids . 
  * the second raid 16-17 feb 1944 * after the first raid many civilians were evacuated from helsinki , and the remaining civilian population was better prepared for an attack . 
  based on radio intelligence the bombing raid was expected , a silent alarm was given over an hour before and air-raid alarm was sounded before actual radar contact on attacking bombers . 
  the soviets attacked with 406 bombers dropping 4317 bombs or about 682 tons . 
  this time the air defence was prepared with a deception : a fake burning helsinki east of the city . 
  they had collected big bonfires in vuosaari east of helsinki , and set up an aaa battery with outdated guns and searchlights over there . 
  when the bombing raid begun they set the bonfires on fire , with the aaa battery firing as fast as they could , and shut down all searchlights west of city . 
  the result was that many bombers got disoriented and attacked the fake helsinki dropping their bombs into woods . 
  again by far most bombers completely missed their target with only about 100 bombs hitting helsinki ( 2.3 % ) . 
  deaths : 25 ( 0 military ) buildings destroyed : 22 bombers destroyed : 8 * the third raid 26-27 feb 1944 * the last raid was the fiercest . 
  again the raid was expected and a silent alarm had given the population plenty of time to prepare before the general air-raid alarm was given . 
  and again there were honeypot aaa batteries with searchlights to the east of city . 
  the soviets attacked with 929 bombers dropping 5182 bombs or about 818 tons . 
  they attacked in three waves and the battle lasted for 11 hours . 
  the first phase was a concentrated attack on the city center , but was mostly repelled with some of the bombers getting through . 
  in the second phase the soviets tried to attack the air defences but failed completely . 
  and the final phase was again a concerted attack to the city center . 
  and yet again by far most bombers dropped their bombs prematurely into sea or outside the city . 
  only about 290 bombs hit helsinki ( 5.6 % ) . 
  deaths : 21 ( 3 military ) buildings destroyed : 59 bombers destroyed : 9 some of the bomber flight paths during the second phase on a [ radar map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tmyo57e ) ** the aftermath ** more deception . 
  finns used a captured soviet spy in helsinki to inform the soviets that helsinki had been completely destroyed . 
  also swedish papers were helping in the deception by publishing fake front page news about levelled helsinki . 
  and the soviets bought it . 
  the elite add bomber force got their awards for job well done and went on to other tasks . 
  everybody happy . 
  the truth came out only after the war when the allied control commission led by soviet general andrei zhdanov arrived in helsinki . 
  zhdanov was flaggerbasted by the apparent limited damage . 
  he thought there was some sort of fakery going on with fake facades because in his books the city had been destroyed . 
  three nights total . 
  bombing sorties : 2100 ( 400-900 bombers per raid ) bombs dropped : 2600 tons ( about 16500 pcs ) bombs actually hit helsinki : 670 ( ~ 4 % ) deaths : 151 ( incl 6 military ) , 365 wounded buildings destroyed : 109 ( 35 masonry , 74 wooden ) anti-aircraft shells fired : 47000 ( ~ 60 railroad carriages ), 
  since you asked for advice , here 's my two cents :  regular democratic process means replacing a corrupt party/alliance with an equally corrupt party . 
  start a new party . 
  it may be left-wing or right-wing , liberal or conservative or whatever but the point is to keep * your * party free of corruption as much as possible . 
  set up basic rules for that purpose , such as : corruption thrives in opaqueness . 
  therefore your party 's funding and accounts should be transparent and public . 
  same with campaign donations , all should be public . 
  then anyone can check where the money comes from and where it goes . 
  makes hiding corruption harder . 
  corruption tends to abuse conflicts of interest . 
  make the possible conflicts of interest public by having party officials and candidates to declare their notable ownerships , ties to companies etc. 
  then it 's easier for anyone to point out if such conflicts of interest arise . 
  corrupt party leaders tend to nominate their corrupt pals as party officials . 
  therefore all party officials including party leadership should be elected democratically by party members , and not nominated by party leaders . 
  the same goes with the party 's candidates for public elections . 
  this has a side effect of rotating party leadership if it gets stale , and encouraging critisism within the party . 
  do n't name the party the anti-corruption party , or make anti-corruption the main platform as no-one will believe that . 
  just make it a point that * your * party is not corrupt , will fight to keep corruption within the party in check , and has records to show it . 
  now , all that involves lot of work , progress will be slow and success is far from certain .
