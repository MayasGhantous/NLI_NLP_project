  it may be better to start locally as a grass roots movement for local council election or something , and then grow from there . 
  an interesting commentary , with comparisons to russia , by russian political analyst : [ ukraine is indeed divided -- into lumpen and people with a sense of dignity ] ( http://maidantranslations.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/ukraine-is-indeed-divided-into-lumpen-and-people-with-a-sense-of-dignity/ )  russian media talks about a conflict between ` fascist hooligans ' and ` the law enforcement ' . 
  somehow , no one says that the conflict is against a criminal state that takes medics hostages , that beats up students and journalists , that douses people with water cannons at -10 celsius , that throws gas grenades into infirmaries . 
  by and large , i believe the current events to be one of those rare cases that political philosophy describes as the natural right of the people to rebel -- rebel against an illegitimate and unjust government . 
  sounds like good news for consumers in the newly joined countries . 
  at least over here using nordpool spot pricing in home electricity contract gives quite competitive electricity prices . 
  the price varies with its highs and lows but on average stays as one of the lowest pricing schemes - though not always the best as there often is a bit lower prices available . 
  for example vattenfall spot pricing history for home contract : 2012 2013 average : 4,17 5,34 cent/kwh max monthly : 6,75 6,17 min monthly : 1,93 4,67 ( = spot + 0,25 cent ; not incl . 
  tax 24 % and transfer ), 
  plus the vendor lock-in : even if a proprietary product is * gratis * at first , the file formats and data will be dependent on the product and vendor to a various degree . 
  doom and gloom ? 
   how fast do freight trains travel ? 
  chorus : monorail ...  how much speed matter for them ? 
  monorail . 
   will technology behind rail baltica be futureproof ? 
  monorail !, 
   and is there such thing as futureproof in rail transportation ? 
  monoraiiil !, 
  no , wait . 
  what 's with the editorializing ? 
  relevant from yesterday 's nyt : [ as ukraine 's president returns from leave , his options seem dismal ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/world/europe/as-ukraines-president-returns-from-leave-his-options-seem-dismal.html ) i believe he does n't have much room to manouver any more . 
  so there probably will be early presidential and parliamentary elections , and perhaps restoring the 2004 constitution . 
  if so it 's unlikely yanukovich will be elected as president . 
  but if opposition votes scatter between parties in parliamentary election his party might have a chance to get enough seats to get into government - maybe even the pm post . 
  and if that happens it could be 2004 all over again . 
  in the orange revolution yanukovich lost his post as a president . 
  but after the next parliamentary election he became the pm . 
  which suited him well because one of the main points of the orange revolution was to strip costitutional presidential powers and move them to the pm . 
  and as a pm yanukovich could say hello to all those sweet sweet new powers . 
  and later he overthrew all those constitutional changes and returned powers to himself as president . 
  both times when power was redistributed he managed to be on the receiving end . 
  so perhaps it will be his strategy also this time ? 
  after restoring the 2004 constitution not to be the president but the future pm with more powers ? 
  plot twist : they 'll vote on it nov 5th . 
  austrian paper format has an article on how president yanukovych and his cronies manage their assets via austria : [ millionen-gr\u00fc\u00dfe aus kiew ] ( http://www.format.at/articles/1405/931/372187/millionen-gruesse-kiew ) the complex ownership schemes in [ infographic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/flzi4u2 ),

  [ debate : is ukraine 's opposition a democratic movement or a force of right-wing extremism ?

  an infotaining article by a translator : [ ukraine 's take on why east is east ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/ukraines-take-on-why-east-is-east/493644.html#ixzz2s5zjqsdi ) resident ukrainians , is her interpretation correct ? 
  dw : [ at munich security conference , klitschko and ukrainian opposition promise to continue fight ] ( http://www.dw.de/at-munich-security-conference-klitschko-and-ukrainian-opposition-promise-to-continue-fight/a-17403289?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf )  klitschko called for a return to the country 's 2004 constitution , which would sharply curtail the president 's power , while also demanding the government release critics and hold elections as soon as possible . 
  indeed . 
  without undoing the changes yanukovych made to the constitution and having a new election there will be no chance of moving away from the authoritarian rule . 
  you have posted this same blogspam garbage to eight different subreddits already . 
  seems like you 're on a mission , man . 
  epp ( european people 's party ) is a centre-right political group in the european parliament . 
  the largest leftist group is s&d ( progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ) and nominates their own candidates for commission president . 
  and leaving to vienna is not accidental because of his family 's and `` family 's '' businesses there : http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2014/01/30/7011979/ for example garda handels und beteiligungs gmbh seems an interesting company which owns a donetsk factory receiving government subsidies from the ukrainian budget . 
  the generous subsidies from the state budget seem to work as a scam to transfer taxpayer 's money directly to the pockets of the oligarchy . 
  the same guys who manage public spending benefit from them , and the system is kept opaque making wrongdoings easier . 
  to voters in donetsk they say that without heftier susbidies people would lose their jobs , get voted in , and the long con keeps on filling the pockets with money collected from ukrainian taxpayers . 
   but he said that if countries like ukraine , georgia and moldova enter a `` deep free trade agreement '' with the eu , as currently envisaged by the eastern partnership , moscow fears that these markets will be flooded with cheap western products , which would undermine russian exports . 
  so many times this . 
  russia is worried about it 's exports which may not be able to successfully compete with higher quality/lower price goods from the eu . 
  russia has successfully managed to frame the issue totally backwards : that russia is worried about cheap eu goods entering russia from ukraine - which makes no sense when you think about it . 
  yet this ass-backwards version is the narrative often heard in the western discussion . 
  do n't do it !, 
  downloading europe can only lead to final countdown . 
   well that was fast . 
  while you might never heard of it before , it 's not like the visa free regime happened all of sudden , and while it is related to the association agreement , it 's a separate process . 
  visa free regime for eastern partnership countries has been in preparation for years , and has been implemented gradually as moldova has addressed the blocks for it to happen and fulfilled the criteria .

  dmytro bulatov , a missing protester , has been found beaten and tortured but alive . 
   dmytro bulatov has been recently found in village vyshenku near kyiv . 
  dmytro told the journalists that he was severely beaten by unknown people , he was tortured , his ear was cut . 
  he was even crucified , he has pricks on his hands . 
  dmytro bulatov does not know how kidnapped him but he mentioned that hose men had russian accent . 
  after being severely beaten , dmytro was thrown away from the car . 
  he went through the village , knocking at the doors of people 's houses . 
  one of the local residents let him in . 
  from there dmytro called his friends who took him to kyiv .

  will be a hairraising event . 
   better yet , the oligarchs should be made aware of that ahead of time . 
  indeed . 
  even a voiced threat of that possibility would have an impact . 
  no , i still do n't think they have influence enough to invade poland or get nukes . 
  seems that 's just fantastic stories by a bit looney spokesperson of a tiny group of extremists . 
  yes , there has been demonstrations in support of euromaidan in different eu countries including latvia , cyprus and finland among others . 
  check the earlier threads for links to news and images ( e.g.

   it is likely that more will change , we are not going to stop . 
  damn right . 
  yanukovich blinked already . 
  you guys keep on pressing on . 
  i do n't know for certain but i believe his support base among the oligarchy has been eroding - they probably do n't appreciate his poor performance in handling the protests . 
  if so then it 's only a matter of time to see him gone without the prospect of getting re-elected . 
  i agree that across the board economic sanctions would not make sense , but how about targeting the super-rich oligarchs ? 
  they have pretty much pwned the country 's economy and the fifty richest have combined wealth amounting to about half of ukraine 's gdp . 
  [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j32zkdj ) needless to say with the prevalent corruption they have huge political influence . 
  currently the protesting opposition is pretty much the only force that can diverge ukraine 's current course from authoritarian rule towards democratic one .
