  without the protests yanukovich could freely continue consolidating power to himself and stay at power indefinitely - as that 's exactly what he has been doing . 
  there certainly is also extreme elements among the protestors , with ridiculously extreme and even dangerous views , but for example the right section is tiny . 
  so , if the protests succeed in their demands of restoring the constitution and having a new election , i do n't think it would lead to ukraine with nuclear weapons or invading poland . 
  yep , and apparently he had something to hide about the siege . 
  none of the recent concessions really matters as long as yanukovich is in power and rules by the constitution he changed with the help of judiciary system he has manned with his judges etc. 
  from the beginning the two most important opposition demands are restoring the 2004 constitution ( i.e. 
  undoing yanukovich 's changes ) and having a new election . 
  while those do not guarantee an immediate improvement , without them there will be no chance at all of moving away from the authoritarian rule . 
  and both of those are needed . 
  if yanukovich goes but constitution remains with power centralized to the president there will be just another authoritarian ruler . 
  and if constitution is restored but yanukovich stays in power he still has the judiciary system in his pocket and can carry on consolidating power to himself . 
  so the protest continues and the demands remain the same . 
  do they have a change of success ? 
  sure . 
  but that depends on many factors , such as how does the oligarchy of business elite align - if their support to yanukovich dwindles he loses . 
  the root of the problem is deep and goes back to the first president leonid kravchuk . 
  as a remnant of the soviet era he did n't start building civic society with democratic institutions and grass roots democracy but proceeded to consolidate power to the president , i.e. 
  himself . 
  and there has been a constant tug of war between centralized authoritarian and distributed democratic power ever since - with the business elite having their hand in there too , of cource . 
   i prefer putin 's russia to banderist ukraine . 
  how about a democratic ukraine as opposed to autocratic one ? 
  [ ukraine 's yanukovych takes sick leave as opposition refuses to abandon protests ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10606363/ukraines-yanukovych-takes-sick-leave-as-opposition-refuses-to-abandon-protests.html ) yanukovych 's office : `` the president of ukraine is on sick leave due to acute respiratory disease accompanied by fever . '', 
  well at least it was n't closed the same way the original [ museum ] ( http://www.saint-petersburg.com/museums/museum-defense-siege-leningrad/ ) was :  a memorial museum was established around the current site immediately after the end of the blockade , and covered an area over thirty times the size of the present exhibition . 
  a number of ` trophy ' nazi tanks and aircraft were among the 37,000 exhibits , many of which were donated by citizens . 
  fearing the unifying power of such a monument , * stalin ordered its destruction during his purge of the leningrad party in 1948 . 
  the museum 's director was shot , the larger exhibits were disbursed and destroyed in secret , and the rest were burnt until there was nothing left . 
  * it was not until the late eighties that it became possible to re-establish the museum . 
  once again , blockade survivors and their families provided most of the exhibits , and the museum reopened on 8 september 1989 . 
  this article is from 2004 : [ ukraine at the brink of a break-up ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/30/ukraine ) * talk of an east-west split in ukraine is oversimplified and highly unlikely , says gwendolyn sasse * despite being 10 years old it 's not even funny how well the article describes also the present day 's often over-simplistic portrayals in the media :  much of the discussion surrounding the disputed election portrays an image of the east-west political split of the country along ethno-linguistic lines or a russian-western conflict over ukraine . 
  a violent break-up of the country is presented as the worst-case scenario . 
    these views are reminiscent of the debates over the future of ukraine in the early 1990s . 
  we seem to have come full circle . 
  the circularity of the analysis on ukraine is epitomised by the revival of cold war rhetoric among western observers , depicting ukraine as the battleground for us-eu and russian influence and interests . 
  this polarised image is underpinned by over-simplistic representations of viktor yushchenko as `` pro-western '' and his opposite , viktor yanukovych , as `` pro-russian '' . 
   ...  most importantly , much of the recent discussion about ukraine misses the key point about the current impasse in kiev , namely that this is a political standoff over domestic political issues ( the kuchma regime , corruption , oligarchic influence , media controls etc ) . 
  also the problems ukraine has are very much the same ( or gotten worse ) : power centralized to the president , constitutional issues , corruption , judiciary system , oligarchy , media freedom etc.

  her name is lesya orobets . 
  here 's her brief on the recent decisions and situation : https://www.facebook.com/lesyaorobets/posts/654587317910517  at a present moment no concessions were made by yanukovich . 
  these are tactical goals of steps undertaken ( `` voluntary resignation '' of azarov , `` repeal of dictatorship laws '' ) : - to save foreign assets of yanukovich 's family , his circle and oligarchs from immediate sanctions by western governments ; - to defeat the informational wave in western media by making an illusion of `` compromise '' and `` normalisation '' ; - to avoid harming putin 's olympics with a background of poorly veiled intervention into internal affairs of ukraine . 
    ...   message 4 : a working group is needed to change the constitution . 
  the constitutional court is headed by the former municipal judge from yenakiieve , yanukovich 's birth town . 
  they are close acquaintances . 
  it was the constitutional court that `` repealed '' the previous constitution ( the fruit of a compromise during orange revolution , that managed to balance the power branches ) and `` brought back '' the constitution of kuchma 's times . 
  no working group or parliament 's act is needed to bring back the democratic balanced constitution . 
  the working group is meant to buy time - to quench activists countrywide with thugs , to grow `` berkut '' troops ' numbers and to weaken the protesters on maidan , carrying on in the -10 to -25 centigrade cold ( +14 to -13 fahrenheit ) . 
  yanukovich can simply instruct his fellow countryman and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to annul his previous ruling , and this can be done within 24 hours . 
     i urge western diplomats , media and public to avoid extrapolating democratic realities onto the modern ukraine , and judge yanukovichs by his real deeds , not tricks meant for the spectators . 
  priests and church have had a prominent presence during the protests ever since the november 30 violent attack on protesters . 
  here 's religious leader 's pov on the protests : [ ukraine movement a ` maidan of dignity ' , says bishop ] ( http://en.radiovaticana.va/articolo.asp?c=767406 ) interesting tidbit :  in early january , the ukrainian ministry of culture sent a letter to the major archbishop of the ukrainian greek catholic church , his beatitude sviatoslav shevchuk , stating that the church 's involvement in the protest could lead to a revocation of its legal status . 
  `` that is a very serious threat expressed to a church that for much of the 20th century , by the powers that be , was outlawed , '' bishop gudziak said . 
  protests in ukraine have been noted in armenia too : [ ukrainian domino effect ] ( http://souciant.com/2014/01/ukrainian-domino-effect/ ) but i think similar protests happening in armenia is unlikely . 
  an article with an opinion survey : [ twr research : ukraine political crisis , east vs west ( survey results ) ] ( http://www.theworldreporter.com/2014/01/twr-research-ukraine-political-crisis.html#.uukch0iwjhs.reddit )  60 % of ukrainians said they will prefer european union , 33.33 % said they want to align towards russia or customs union and 6.66 % people said they want a free country , neither towards european union or russia . 
  to be taken with grain of salt as they 're not that clear about their methodology and sample size , and it 's difficult to say how representative their results actually are . 
  [ protest in ukraine / protest in russia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wbfpjhk ) [ possibly nsfw-ish for prudes ], 
  they must have been buying that tricle dust which makes the trickle-down economics work . 
  wikibot , tell us about edi rama, 
  subgroup . 
  his two relevant claims are :  the finns are epic friday-night bingers the alcohol consumption in finland is pretty much eu average . 
  i do n't know actual eu statistics to support his claim regarding the epicness of binging - it 's possible but citation needed to see if it 's really epic , above average or average . 
   and alcohol is now the leading cause of death for finnish men . 
  the leading cause of death for finnish men is diseases of the circulatory system . 
  and yes , alcohol related diseases and accidental poisoning by alcohol are the leading cause of death in the subgroup of working age men . 
  but men do live longer than 64 on average . 
  that 's what the stats say . 
  yet saying * `` the finns are pretty average at alcohol consumption and alcohol is the leading cause of death among working age men '' * just would not have the same klang to it . 
  in fact it would only raise questions : what 's actually going on ? 
  how is that possible ? 
  then you 'd have to start actually looking behind the numbers . 
  and that is really beyond the scope of the article which uses pretty random and even weird stuff combined with stereotypes and anecdotes to make its points . 
  i mean , just look at his claims about firearm ownership , with incorrect stats mind you , and the humorous insinuation * `` assuming no one shoots you '' * . 
  it is funny , but if you were to actually use that article as a resource for collecting data or something , beware . 
  revolutions and transitions often do take time . 
  to get a clearer picture check the timeline in this assessment : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ) one of the tug of wars has been the balance of power between centralized authoritarian model ( prez ) and more democratic parliamentary model . 
  it started already in 1991 when the first president kravchuk begun centralizing his power rather than building real parliamentary democracy . 
  that tug of war has been a source of constitutional crises , and one of the main demands by the protesting opposition is indeed constitutional reforms . 
  no prob , mate . 
  he published an english version today if you prefer : [ maidan inside out ] ( http://zyalt.livejournal.com/986689.html ), 
   besides , why not both ? 
  indeed . 
  the association agreement with the eu has no impact nor does it prevent any other trade or free trade agreements ukraine has or chooses to have in the future with other countries . 
  possible negative consequenses to trade with russia could happen only if russia chooses to retaliate with embargoes . 
  in that case also russia 's trade would suffer , so possible embargoes would probably be short term . 
  anyway , that would happen only if russia chooses to retaliate for ukraine signing an agreement - nothing in the aa itself prevents trade with russia as usual . 
   why does finland have such a high homicide rate ? 
  in 2013 there were 100 homicides in finland ( rate 1.8 ) . 
  i do n't know how that rate compares with other eu countries - but yeah , they all were one too many . 
  a typical finnish homicide is committed by a drunk , low educated , middle-aged , unemployed alcoholic who assaults his associate in a drinking group . 
  these cases represent over 75 % of all homicides in finland . 
  despite finland having a high rate of firearm ownership generally only about 18 % of all homicides are commited with firearms the most common weapon being knife . 
   i do n't think that it causes the high homicide rate but interesting thing nonetheless . 
  yeah , it is interesting but does not explain a lot as the allele frequency ( not to be confused with haplotype freq ) of htr2b q20 * is pretty low - confirmed in  20,000 finns . 
  this presentation has an interesting overview regarding the mutation and its effects : [ our genes , our choices - genes in context : family , founder population , exposure ] ( http://www.niuva.fi/nsfp/esitykset/03.%20david%20goldman_our%20genes,%20our%20choises.pdf ), 
   that said , sweden ( and the other `` neutrals '' ) chose a side ( the eu ) , so they 're not neutral anyway and the point the author is trying to make is incorrect irrespectively . 
  yep . 
  being neutral has changed after the cold war . 
  sweden ( also finland etc ) is not really neutral any more , and terms ` post-neutral ' or ` militarily non-aligned ' are rather used to describe the current position . 
  it 's arguable whether they are exactly accurate either . 
   i would feel no motivation in life if people ... * what do you care what other people think ?
