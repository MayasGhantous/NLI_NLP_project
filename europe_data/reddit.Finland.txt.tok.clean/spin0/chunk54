  i liked the article and had a good laugh reading it . 
  nordic countries are certainly not without their problems . 
  just do not take the ` facts ' he presents seriously . 
  some of them are just as cherry picked and misrepresented as in some of the ` praise the nordics ' types of articles . 
  for example , alcohol is not actually the leading cause of death for finnish men - it 's number four ( * . 
  but it 's fun to claim it is with cherry picked data and he 's demonstrating how easy it is to distort the picture of whole countries . 
  and that 's exactly the joke . 
  mocking the praising articles , and having fun with stereotypes . 
  i had a good laugh . 
  * ) causes of death among finnish men 2012 diseases of the circulatory system 38 % neoplasms 25 % dementia , alzheimer 's disease 8 % alcohol related diseases and accidental poisoning by alcohol 4 %, 
  another interesting analysis from central european policy institute : [ ukraine scenarios and central europe ] ( http://www.cepolicy.org/publications/ukraine-scenarios-and-central-europe )  having failed to triumph with the misbegotten eastern partnership , europe must now work even harder to avert disaster . 
   there are no good options . 
  but there are options . 
  one is to put pressure on the regime through its weakest point : the oligarchs . 
  they have a long-term interest in staying rich , free and integrated with the west . 
  a combination of visa bans , money-laundering investigations and ostracism would quickly get the message across that they can not be free-riders on ukraine 's future . 
   a related policy would be to apply visa sanctions to those involved in brutality and abuses . 
  the united states , commendably , has shown that this is possible with its magnitsky law , which penalises those involved in the death of the eponymous whistleblower , and in the $ 230m fraud which he uncovered . 
  europe , shamefully , has failed to follow suit . 
  but it could . 
   less effective , but still useful , would be public statements from public figures . 
  the silence of most governments in the region is as striking as it is saddening . 
  hungary has just done an energy deal with russia . 
  slovakia may be mulling a similar one . 
  the czech republic lacks a government . 
  poland has done plenty already : donald tusk blames his foreign minister for the unpleasant surprises of the past months . 
  he does not want more . 
  i totally agree with the option to put targeted pressure on oligarchs . 
  a very informative analysis : [ rebirth of a nation ] ( http://euromaidanpr.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/rebirth-of-a-nation/ )  what continues to amaze me is the lack of understanding among the general public and even politicians in the west that we are watching historical events evolve before our eyes . 
  a country of 53 million and the size of france is going through a sort of `` re-birth '' , confirming its national identity . 
  this sounds paradoxical when the threat of the country falling apart in two parts is not unreal ; however , in fact this is part of the same process .

  here 's the territorial evolution of ukraine from ukrainian states ( ukrainian republic of kiev and west ukrainian people 's republic ) after wwi : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukraine-growth.png, 
   so they revolted against him and then elected him again and now they 're rioting against him again ? 
  yes , but it 's more complicated than that . 
  to get a clearer picture try reading the timeline in this asessment : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ), 
  i 'd recommend this informative asessment of the developments in ukraine since the independency : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ), 
   ~ ~ animals . ~ ~ humans . 
   you 're cheering them ... 
  i 'm not . 
  in fact i think radical nationalism combined with violent right-wing extremism is a dangerous turn of events and has a chance of serious repercussions the longer it keeps on . 
  because now that the pandora 's box is open what would close the lid ? 
  what could pacify the most violent radicals down the line ? 
  how could violent factions such as ` the right sector ' be convinced to accept a compromize and to stop their violent ` reconquista ' ? 
  and while i may disagree with some of your rhetorics i 'm glad to hear you 're opposed of it .

   just curious , why does n't the ukrainian police use tear gas or pepper spray ? 
  they have used both since 30 november 04:00 am . 
  the author overestimates the insightfulness of his map and his analysis . 
  concentrating on language alone is a gross oversimplification and in some ways misleading . 
  in demographics there are other very significant factors at play - for example age : by far mostly the elderly want to align with russia while most of the young support a future with the eu . 
  the pronounced generational split is apparent in this [ graph . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/turo7c9.jpg ) support for russia 's customs union is by far highest among the 70 + year olds . 
  ( [ poll by the kyiv international institute of sociology ] ( http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=ukr&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=196&amp;page=1 ) from sept/oct , 41 % favoured the eu and 35 % russia 's customs union ) . 
  and of course , the protests are not only about the eu or russia question but more importantly about the wider issues in ukraine : corruption , judicial system , oligarchy etc. 
  for background on those i recommend reading this concise and informative asessment of the developments in ukraine since the independency : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ) or this short and to the point comment by a ukrainian protester : https://m.facebook.com/aleksandra.kovalyova/posts/10200226628266773 tl ; dr : interpreting the events by language only does not give understanding . 
   so the question is - `` why would russia give ukraine any money , any debt relief , any market opportunities or any better deal on gas , if your political elite ( and it seems a huge portion of your population ) is openly anti-russian ? '', 
  you 're making your question a loaded one by confusing issues . 
  being against russia 's influence in ukraine is not the same as being anti-russian . 
  the association agreement would not suddenly prevent trade , market opportunities and trade agreements between ukraine and russia to their mutual benefit . 
  not even a eu membership would do that : even if ukraine someday decided to apply for a eu membership there would be benefits and new opportunities for russia and russian businesses too . 
  it 's not a zero sum game . 
  but with the all or nothing approach your question seems to assume it is . 
   `` would you support giving ukraine a loan of at least 10 bln $ personally , yes - but i 'm not comfortable with supporting a corrupt regime with billions , so i would support such loan if it leads to for example reforms in judicial system and anti-corruption measures . 
  but that is a moot question , because loans have been already offered from the imf with low 2-3 % interest rate . 
  the imf loan comes with conditions and these are the main ones : `` we recommend a focus on structural reforms that would address the most binding constraints to growth . 
  this includes ** revamping the judicial system , simplifying or repealing burdensome government regulations , stepping up anti-corruption measures , and enforcing clear and consistent rules in tax administration . 
  ** decisive progress in these areas should raise productivity and investment , substantially lifting potential growth in the medium term . '', 
  implementing such reforms would be good for ukraine , good for the people , good for the business enviroment and investement etc - but they would be poison to the ` families ' running the country and its economy . 
  instead they chose the more expensive loan from russia with a 5 % interest rate . 
  and that loan also has unfavourable conditions as [ russia can call in ukraine 's loans anytime it wants ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/183432.html ) . 
  with that putin has even more leverage to put pressure on ukraine : they can call off the loans and demand repayment at will . 
   and buying more of their products ? 
  the eu already buys a lot of ukraine 's products . 
  in fact the eu is ukraine 's top export and import partner , and with the association agreement ukraine would have a free access to the eu market which would mean even more trade . 
  in 2012 ukraine 's exports to the eu were about $ 14.6 bn while to the russia about $ 13.3 bn . 
  and in 2012 the total value of ukraine 's trade with the eu was $ 37.7 bn which is almost as big as trade with the * whole * cis bloc of former soviet states ( including russia ) at $ 38.2 bn : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3pgftlx.jpg ) main export partners 2012 eu 26.6 % russia 23.7 % turkey 6.0 % china 4.1 % main import partners 2012 eu 31.2 % russia 19.4 % china 10.2 % the association agreement means even more trade than the existing trade agreements with the eu ( e.g. 
  the deep and comprehensive free trade area ( dcfta ) gives ukraine a free access to the eu 's over 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros - while russia 's customs union has only 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
   ( more agriculture stuff i guess ? 
  doubt anyone would buy machinery , when you have germany ) ukraine 's exports to the eu are more diverse than you seem to imply : 2012 ukraine 's exports to the eu were $ 14.6 bn of which non-agricultural products $ 10.4 bn ( 71 % ) . 
  fine , thanks . 
  ukraine is not in the customs union .

  apparently in opinion surveys there has also been a generational split : mostly the old want to align with russia while most of the young support future with the eu .
