  interesting short analysis of the special [ 12-gauge brass slugs fired at kiev protesters ] ( http://merera.livejournal.com/295325.html ) [ image ] ( http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj126/merera/livejournal/blondo_collage.jpg ) apparently it 's experimental ammo intented for instant door opening and car stopping manufactured by `` spetstekhnika '' labs affiliated with ukrainian police . 
  getting hit with that is ugly . 
  similar caliber slugs are used for boar hunting . 
  [ did someone say wizards ? 
  yep , the protesters are drumming with drums , barrels , rails , corrugated iron etc. 
  probably to make known they 're there , to raise spirits , and perhaps it helps to keep warm too .

  [ `` russia enraged by alien involvement in ukraine '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzsuzba.png ), 
  [ * `` those romans are crazy '' * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xgonhhs.jpg ), 
  you so predictable : http://rt.com/news/ukraine-protest-us-embassy-056/, 
  probably as a staged titushka reaction to us embassy revoking visas of ukrainian officials linked to police violence . 
  then they can film it and show on russia today how ukrainians are enraged because such american injustice . 
   association agreement talks about cooperation between eu/ukraine in the areas of freedom , justice and security . 
  other things included are : reform of ukrainian judicial system , law enforcement agencies , election system , fighting corruption , trade/economic cooperation , improvement of the business climate etc all things are good and we 're cool with everything ( except the ` security ' thing , but that , i hope . 
  should n't take an explanation ) yes i know what the association agreement talks about . 
  while your answer is an interesting read as such , you seem to have missed the question : in your opinion what are the five best things for ukraine in the aa and why ? 
  perhaps i should take your answer literally and simply as * `` all things are good '' * , but i was actually hoping to hear your personal insights and analyses regarding the contents of the aa and it 's potential effects for ukraine . 
   mind you , these are all the prerequisites and ukrainians must work hard for this . 
  prerequisities for a potential eu membership if ukraine chooses to apply someday . 
  the aa gives a 10 year framework to implement reforms , and yes , it needs hard work from ukrainians and would be beneficial for the country in the long term . 
  i hear georgia , despite it 's problems , has made quite a lot of progress already and i believe them signing the aa was a good decision for them . 
  here 's an interesting read ( though may sound overtly optimistic ) : [ rose revolution shows the results of freeing markets ] ( http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2013/11/13/rose-revolution-shows-the-results-of-freeing-markets )  during this time , you must also be getting the news how ukraine got much pressure about tymoshenko . 
  she is in kharkiv and i know about her ` conditions ' , and its not that bad as portrayed . 
  well , i 'm not a doctor nor an expert on her health issues , so can not say . 
   besides , she is actually a criminal according to ukrainian laws . 
  according to ukrainian laws pretty much everybody is a criminal . 
  it 's just that only some get convicted because of selective justice . 
  i have no doubt that tymoshenko was convicted by political use of selective justice , and the length of her prison term was too convenient to be a mere coincidence . 
  that is not to say she 's completely innocent . 
  and when you say russia does n't like yanukovych and would like to see a leader opposed to him i believe tymoshenko , despite being a divisive character as much hated as she 's loved by others , may still have leadership potential in the future - depending on how many variables play out , of course . 
  but she 's not allowed to run in 2015 . 
   now mr yanukovych could have probably pardoned her , but he did not want her to be free so easily and face a political danger . 
  understandable . 
  though , eu should n't have pressured on tymoshenko issue too much . 
  yep , i agree that eu pressed that issue too much which was not wise . 
  the first mistake was to weld the two separate things aa and tymoshenko together ( ca n't recall how such mistake was made in the first place ) . 
  after that it was difficult if not impossible to let go of the other , and all there was left to do was press on . 
  pretty naive strategy when you think about it . 
   we thought , ok , ukraine reforms its infrastructure , corruption goes down , better politics - good thing . 
  yes , that 's how i have always seen it : all those things and more would be good things for ukraine , russia , the eu , and europe . 
  we all have very much common good in that regard , and i have always thought that we all have lot more common interests than conflicting ones . 
  and actually , even at risk of being called naive , i still believe so . 
   maybe we 'll somehow discuss with the eu about opting out of the security thing , because we 've military there and it 'd be conflicting interests . 
  this is the biggest conflicting one i have seen . 
  russia has huge security interests here and respecting those , without creating collisions in europe , should be considered important . 
  i do n't know * how * to accommodate those , but having serious discussions should be the way to go . 
    but president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , publicly announced in feb 2013 , basically said : ukraine can not be in the customs union and eu . 
  ok . moscow : urgent meetings , expert assessment panels/commissions , change of plans how was it a surprise ? 
  is n't it kinda obvious that a country can not be a member of both customs union and the eu at the same time . 
  the aa is not eu membership , but that would probably be on the table in the long run after the aa . 
  as trade goes the aa does not suddenly prevent trade and trade agreements between ukraine and russia . 
  hell , not even a eu membership would do that . 
  in fact , even if ukraine became a eu member there would still be benefits to russia in it . 
  i mean , look at for example relations and trade between finland and russia . 
  investments and trade between us are growing to our * mutual benefit * partly because finland is a member of the eu and the ez . 
  of course that is not the sole reason - we are in good terms in many other ways too - but certainly they have not prevented trade . 
  we both have benefited from that , and currently we 're seriously considering visa free regime for russians ( me supports ! ) . 
  even if ukraine someday decided to become a eu member there would be big benefits and new opportunities for russia and russian businesses too . 
  it 's not a zero sum game . 
   so we basically started blocking their products into russia . 
  trade took a hit . 
  that kind of thinking is why i do n't think very highly of putin 's policies . 
  you have joined the wto , signed the agreements and now this . 
  reading that is just sad . 
  how much did russian import businesses lose in you guys doing that ? 
  yeah , fuck them and their businessess amirite . 
  and it 's not even exceptional - russia does these random silly-reason embargoes all the time to various countries . 
  it 's rather obvious that russia * actually wants to damage other countries ' economies at will * . 
  did you guys read what the wto is about when you joined or do you just not care ? 
  you do know why many may not see russia as a reliable trading partner , but more like a necessary evil who will fail you at will ? 
   to rebuild economy , we offered ukraine $ 15 billion plus 33 % discount on bills . 
  to avoid getting money into bad hands , this money was given in the form of bonds . 
  on one hand you say russia does n't like yanukovych and would like to see him gone , and on the other hand you provide his regime with billions . 
  i find that difficult to compute . 
  war is hell . 
  i do n't think it would be wise to give financial support to the current corrupt regime . 
   the eu can not impose sanctions because it would just drive ukraine into russian arms . 
  depends on the sanctions , i 'd guess . 
  trade sanctions would not make sense , imo . 
  but if eu could come up with measures that would directly scare and hurt the oligarchs ( money laundering etc ) they could have positive effects . 
  operative word being * could * - that depends on many variables . 
   well , you 're wrong . 
  we have huge cultural and linguistic split in ukraine between west and east . 
  while there are east-west and north-south differences the biggest split is generational : it 's mostly the old who want to align with russia while most of the young support future with the eu . 
  the pronounced generational split is apparent in this [ graph .

  gee , thanks a lot mate . 
  could you please answer this question regarding the associoation agreement : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vs3yt/i_am_a_russian_government_official_and_this_is/cevbldi based on the upvotes many of us would like to know , and you have claimed to have close knowledge about the aa . 
   to be fair , ukraine does need help . 
  be it from russia , the eu , the imf , space aliens , anyone , ukraine is in a bad spot .
