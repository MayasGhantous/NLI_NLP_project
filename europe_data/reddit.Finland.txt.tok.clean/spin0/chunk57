  as cold air is denser it stays near the surface where it continues to cool even more - it just sits there and the surface temperatures get colder and colder . 
  situation may stay that way for weeks until winds bring a low pressure system from the atlantic . 
   pro-eu people go protesting , everyone else stays at home . 
  it 's telling that in south-eastern ukraine in many places outside of kyiv remember that in many cities pro-eu demonstrations have been banned by mayor 's decree especially in the east . 
  that includes also some of your listed cities . 
  yet they have had pro-eu demostrations despite the bans , arrests and police violence . 
   i knew about khazakstan but it 's not in europe . 
  it is in europe the same way e.g. 
  russia is . 
  by the commonly used definition of the continent kazakhstan , azerbaijan , georgia , russia and turkey do have territory both in europe and asia . 
   the only real dictatorship in europe is belarus , azerbaijan - [ hosting next year 's eurovision song contest may force azerbaijan 's dictatorship into greater political openness ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/17/eurovision-song-contest-azerbaijan-dictatorship ) kazakhstan - [ the world 's enduring dictators : nursultan a. nazarbayev , kazakhstan ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-worlds-enduring-dictators-nursultan-a-nazarbayev-kazakhstan-19-06-2011/ ) whether you choose to call those `` real '' dictatorships , dictatorships , or totalitarian or authoritarian regimes is somewhat arbitrary . 
  and that 's the semantic game those rulers and their cronies love to play : * `` nooo , no dictatorships over here , no sir !, 
  just people that need a strong leader to bring stability and order . 
   you missed the halo around the policemans head . 
  and the lower drawn mouth on the woman .

  clearly op 's picture has added features ( including the changed eyebrows ) but what seems unclear is who 's manipulating who here . 
  according to wto you can ban imported seal products . 
  there are also bans in many other countries including the us , mexico , russia and taiwan . 
  of course canada is appealing the wto ruling , but i 'm not sure if it 's worth the effort .

  here 's the latest eurostat [ unemployment statistics ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics ) . 
  the 4000 more in the headline is a tiny change : [ change in the number of unemployed persons ( compared to previous month , in thousands ) , seasonally adjusted , january 2006 - november 2013 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/thumb/f/f9/change_in_the_number_of_unemployed_persons_%28compared_to_previous_month%2c_in_thousands%29%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_january_2006_-_november_2013.png/800px-change_in_the_number_of_unemployed_persons_%28compared_to_previous_month%2c_in_thousands%29%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_january_2006_-_november_2013.png ) the unemplyment rates have flattened in the eu and the ez : [ unemployment rates eu-28 , ea-17 , us and japan , seasonally adjusted , january 2000 - november 2013 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/thumb/f/fc/unemployment_rates_eu-28%2c_ea-17%2c_us_and_japan%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_january_2000_-_november_2013_.png/800px-unemployment_rates_eu-28%2c_ea-17%2c_us_and_japan%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_january_2000_-_november_2013_.png ) and it will take time before it starts to go down . 
   11/29/2012 @ 12:38 pm the article is over a year old yet the latest index is still the 2012-13 one . 
  here 's how countries [ scored and ranked on each of the factors and sub-factors ] ( http://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index-data ) . 
  looks like nordic countries ranked high in every category . 
   according to focus news , which cited itar-tass , basescu said sounds legit . 
  heh , actually many finns love carl gustaf & silvia , and victoria is very popular over here . 
  no thanks . 
  been a republic for nearly a century already . 
  did n't have that good mileage with our last monarch the grand duke [ nicholas ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar_nicholas_ii ) . 
  he loved finland , but finland certainly did n't love him back . 
  sad story . 
  he spent his summers in finnish archipelago with his family and ruled the realm from his yacht , mingled with finnish commoners , and wrote about his love for finland . 
  but finns hated him because of his policies of forced russification and he 's not fondly remembered here . 
  after him we almost had a king . 
  [ prince frederick charles of hesse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_frederick_charles_of_hesse ) was elected as king of finland v\u00e4in\u00f6 i on 9 october 1918 but was never crowned , and as the whole monarchy idea lost political support he renounced the throne soon after . 
  finland 's current would-have-almost-been king v\u00e4in\u00f6 iv or philipp robin prinz und landgraf von hessen lives in new york as a fashion photographer and [ seems pretty cool guy ] ( http://www2.hs.fi/extrat/digilehti/kuukausiliite/arkisto/2002/08/ ) . 
  it 's also interesting that the rate of 5 % is higher than the imf loan would have been ( 2-3 % ) . 
  certainly there were more jobs 7-12 years ago because that 's at the height of the bubble before the crisis hit in 2008-2009 . 
  i mean , is n't it kinda obvious and well known recent history ? 
  that guy claims that there has been * no job creation since the austerity measures * and uses misleading data to support his preconceived notion . 
  his claim is not true as actually there has been significant amount ( 70 000 ) of new jobs with a strong rising trend after the austerity measures . 
  yep , one of his problems is using old data . 
  and clearly i refuted his claim of `` no job creation '' as there has been significant number of new jobs ( 70 000 ) in latvia alone . 
  edit : and as his claim is about the effect of austerity measures it certainly is relevant to look at the data from * after * the austerity measures because that 's the data we need to look at . 
  and the latest data shows his claim is incorrect - there 's 70 000 new jobs created since 2011 and the trend is rising . 
   how much income russia has coming in from loans to nations such as ukraine , and when those loans are due in case of ukraine the interest is 5 % and the loans are due when putin says so . 
  according to the [ unfavourable loan terms ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/183432.html ) russia can call off the loans and demand repayment at any time if situation warrants . 
  the money for the loan was taken from russia 's pension funds . 
   baltic `` austerity success '' has at best meant `` jobless recoveries '' characterized by gdp growth but no job creation . 
  the blog post is an example of using statistics in an effort to try and seek support for a preconceived notion . 
  for example , he makes claims about `` no job creation '' without actually using the relevant up to date job data but chooses to use some other population data which seemingly supports his preconceived conclusions . 
  let 's see for example latvia : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4my9ezc ) the trend is clear with about 70 000 new jobs . 
   no job creation bollocks . 
  another thing is his superficial usage of population stats and hastily leaping to conclusions with them . 
  he 's correct in pointing out that the population has been and is declining but for example he fails to notice that by 2010-11 the trend of emigration from latvia turned to decline and immigration turned to rise with clear trends : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sux59nf ) those are not the only problems with his blog post . 
  it 's riddled with misleading usage of data in an apparent effort to support a personal agenda . 
   looks like a lot better to me than the `` european price '' . 
  ( these prices were in 2012 . 
  the percentages next to the price are the anticipated discounts for 2013 . ), 
  in the article `` european price '' means the european hub prices :  * `` what i find interesting is that $ 268.50 is n't so far off the european hub price , once you deduct transit costs , '' * says simon pirani , a senior research fellow at the oxford institute for energy studies , who specializes on the gas trade in the ex-soviet union . 
  been there , done that : [ kalmar union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmar_union ), 
  yes , i think the amanita muscaria part might very well be true - though the measure poronkusema is a separate concept . 
   greedy german banks lending money to corrupt , cheating greeks ( of course , the banks , if i remember correctly , also helped the greeks cook their books ) that was us investment bank goldman sachs : [ greek debt crisis : how goldman sachs helped greece to mask its true debt ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greek-debt-crisis-how-goldman-sachs-helped-greece-to-mask-its-true-debt-a-676634.html )  without stopping to think about how the greeks might pay that money bank the market did reconsider the risks , which is why greece 's bond yields [ shot up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cusxrnk ) anyway , welcome to the club , latvia !, 
  the point of cutting public spendig ( and making tax reforms etc ) has been to reduce the deficit ( was whopping 16 % in 2009 ) . 
  and indeed it has worked : greece 's primary balance is now positive as opposed to previous years as greece had been running on deficit all through 2000s . 
  yep , reindeers are cool creatures with their mad winter survival skills - they even have a natural antifreezer stored in their bonemarrow . 
   in some cases , it is necessary to expel nutrients if they 're too plentiful . 
  well , in winter reindeers certainly do n't have plentiful nutrients available and their metabolism enters a different regime . 
  as their main source of food in winter is lichen which contains very little protein and minerals reindeers need to save wherever they can . 
  for example about 60-70 % of urea is recycled into their rumen and used by bacteria to produce proteins . 
   it is either concentrated or diluted . 
  ok , especially during winter reindeer urine is very * diluted * . 
   and that this is why they have a unit of measurement for the distance a reindeer can walk until it has to pee . 
  no , that is not why there 's such a unit of distance . 
  it has more to do with the specific features of reindeer physiology . 
  reindeer 's kidneys work quite differently from other ruminant mammals . 
  especially in the winter time their diet is mostly lichen and the kidneys work careful not to lose any precious nutrients with the urine making reindeer urine extra pure . 
  but holding up urine too much or too long may mess with the system and cause proteins to enter into urinary tract , which may lead to a dangerous condition * kusiumpi * or blocked urinary tract . 
  so reindeers need to go like a clock , and hence the * poronkusema * . 
  i do n't know if the * amanita muscaria * story is actually true . 
  but considering that reindeers do have a peculiar urinary system it might be . 
  one way to confirm it would be to try it out , or perhaps check with other reindeer herding people 's traditions ( e.g. 
  in siberia ) to see if also their shamans have used reindeer as a hallusinogen distillery . 
   correction : finns do not use this at all ; it 's the s\u00e1mi . 
  i live in helsinki it is not exclusively a s\u00e1mi expression . 
  it 's more of a regional thing and gets referred to in lapland . 
  and even though the concept originates from s\u00e1mi reindeer herders it is a finnish word we 're discussing and certainly used also by others than the s\u00e1mi . 
   it must have been pretty quiet in the old days , since that is about 10km .
