  originally it was about 6 km but it was redefined in 1665 to be 10.7 km to conform with the swedish * mil * , and then later changed to 10 km with the metric system . 
  * c. loureiroi * does contain high levels of coumarin though generally not as high as some other cassias have . 
  but as it has highest cinnamaldehyde level it also has the strongest ( very profound and poignant , i 'd say ) taste . 
  therefore when cooking asian dishes you often need to use only less than half of what the recipe says . 
  also , * c. loureiroi * is generally even more expensive than real cinnamon and in addition to the taste also price sets it apart from the commonly sold el cheapo cassia , which , as i already mentioned , has a taste that i do not appreciate very much . 
   verum is not free of coumarin , but cassia contains about 20 to 30 times as much . 
  more like 250 to 1800 times as much . 
  true cinnamon ( * cinnamomum verum * ) contains only insignificant traces of coumarin often even below detectable levels . 
  in cassia coumarin level is generally higher by magnitudes but also varies a lot between species and even between sticks in the same retail package . 
  according to [ this paper ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3385612/ ) their sample of * c. verum * was coumarin-free as opposed to samples of cassia which contained between 2.6 to 7.0 g/kg of coumarin . 
  similar observation was also made by [ sproll et al ] ( http://www.researchgate.net/publication/223370583_hplc_analysis_and_safety_assessment_of_coumarin_in_foods ) who reported their five samples of true cinnamon as coumarin-free or below detection but high coumarin contents between 2.8-4 .8 g/kg in their samples of cassia . 
  and also [ wang et al ] ( http://www.cinnamonvogue.com/downloads/cinnamon_and_coumarin.pdf ) reported only traces of coumarin in their 17 samples of true cinnamon ( down to 0.005 g/kg ) but high levels in their samples of cassia ( up to 9.30 g/kg in * c. burmannii * , i.e. 
  1860 times as much ) . 
   uhh , but it does , it just contains way less . 
  well according to [ this paper ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3385612/ ) their sample of * cinnamomum verum * from sri lanka was coumarin-free as opposed to samples of cassia , and generally it contains at most only tiny insignificant traces of coumarin : only about 0.004 % whereas cassia contains up to 1 % . 
  i really would n't hang my hat on that 0.004 % as it 's insignificant any way you look at it , but as it seems important to you : yes it is there . 
  now what ? 
   the only reason why it 's called `` real '' cinnamon , is because it was the first type brought to europe . 
  it * is * called real cinnamon and true cinnamon is n't it . 
  and cheaper cassia is also called bastard cinnamon or chinese cinnamon is n't it . 
   the rest of your comment is filled with half-truths too . 
  yet you have n't shown any half-truths yet , it is true that * cinnamomum verum * is called real cinnamon or true cinnamon , and the tiny traces of coumarin it contains are at most insignificant compared to the 250-fold levels found in cassia . 
   cassia and ceylon cinnamon are both types of the cinnamon-genus . 
  they are related . 
  on top of them , there are saigon cinnamon from vietnam , and a indonesian type i ca n't remember the name of . 
  yes ? 
   ceylon cinnamon is called cinnamomum verum , and has a more subtle taste , while cassia cinnamon ( cinnamomum aromaticum ) has a harsher and more distinctive taste . 
  if you want subtle undertones of cinnamon flavour , that wo n't steal the scene and interrupt other tastes , verum is the one you are looking for . 
  to my taste cassia ( * cinnamomum cassia * blume , syn . 
  * cinnamomum aromaticum * nees ) has some wooden ` mossy ' tones and certain bitterness in it . 
  personally i very much prefer real cinnamon in baking , desserts , sweets and such for its more aromatic taste and also for the fact that i can let the kids eat as many as they like without having to give a second thought to coumarin and their livers . 
  i also very much like saigon cinnamon ( * cinnamomum loureiroi * ) . 
  with its strong pronounced taste it 's especially good for cooking asian dishes . 
  edit : and yes , even if it 's called saigon cinnamon also * c. loureiloi * is actually cassia . 
  it is not being banned anywhere . 
  what is being regulated is the amount of cumarin in foodstuff as it 's toxic . 
  one can still use cassia ( ` bastard cinnamon ' or ` chinese cinnamon ' ) as long as you do n't introduce too much toxic cumarin into food . 
  what i do n't get is why the insistance of calling cassia cinnamon as it is very different from real cinnamon tasting like crap and being toxic and all . 
  it is unfortunate that inferior el cheapo toxic wooden bark * cassia * is widely called cinnamon when actually real cinnamon is different : it is non-toxic and tastes better . 
  and because real cinnamon does not contain toxic cumarin you can use it without worrying about it . 
  ld50 is not very relevant here as it is not only the 50 % chance of instant death that is being regulated against but probable damage resulting from much lower amounts of toxin cumarin in foodstuff , and you may get damaged liver with lot lower amounts of cumarin . 
  real cinnamon does not contain cumarin as you can read from your linked paper . 
  one can make , eat and sell cinnamon foodstuff using real cinnamon without worrying about food being toxic . 
  but unfortunately instead of real cinnamon many use cassia which contains cumarin . 
  cassia is cheap , toxic and does n't taste as good as real cinnamon . 
  yet many call it cinnamon instead of what it is : cassia . 
  i have no problem with toxins in foodstuff being regulated . 
  and in this case the toxin is avoidable : use real cinnamon instead of toxic cassia . 
  or use less cassia to keep the level of toxin in check . 
  personally i have n't used cassia in my cooking for over a decade because of it being toxic and tasting like crap compared to real cinnamon . 
   why not let people decide themselves if they want to eat these toxins or not ? 
  like alcohol . 
  in order to make that decision one needs the information about the presence and preferably also the amount of toxin cumarin in the product . 
  having a label that informs consumer might be a good idea - like alcohol has . 
  i 'd also like to see labeling to stop referring to cassia as cinnamon when it 's actually quite different with its toxin and taste . 
  if the product has cassia then say it 's cassia and tell how much toxin the product has , and if it has real cinnamon instead then say so . 
   regardless , i 'm pretty sure i read somewhere that this story was wrong , or purposefully misrepresenting the facts , on a number of levels . 
  yep . 
  the telegraph story seems mangled : for example claims that it is the amount of cinnamon that is being regulated to 15 mg/kg ( or 50 mg/kg ) when it 's not . 
  actually the regulation is not about the amount of cinnamon but limiting the amount of the toxin cumarin in foodstuff . 
  as real cinnamon has much lower cumarin content compared to the chinese cassia , one can reduce the amount of cumarin in foodstuff by using real cinnamon instead of el cheapo cassia with its toxin . 
  actual cinnamon is also more aromatic and tastes better than cassia - although that may be matter of taste . 
  actually romania has been and will continue to be a net beneficiary from the eu budget . 
  [ the balance 2007-12 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kxwt3lj ) and in the next 2014-2020 mff romania has commitments of for example 21.83 billion in cohesion funding and about 11.9 billion in cap . 
  of course it 's a different question whether romania is able to absorb all those funds . 
  yes , and as always norway would be included in the standard eurobarometer if they were eu members or candidates because the standard eurobarometer is conducted in those . 
  the table is from the latest [ standard eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/index_en.htm ) - a biannual survey which is conducted in the 28 member states and also in the five candidates . 
  the full results including the candidate countries are reported in the annex . 
  since 1973 seb 's purpose has been to measure the evolution of public opinion in the eu and that 's why not all european countries , such as switzerland , norway or ukraine , are included . 
  over here with the introduction of euro about half of the new price tags were rounded higher and about half lower , just as one would expect with random distribution - see this [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q2intl0 ) ( changes in pricing ; orange = lower , grey = higher ; euroon siirtyminen = introduction of euro ), 
  at least over here $ changed the price tags but did not cause a net rise of prices . 
  due to $ some prices rose and some fell , and all in all the prices continued to rise as per the general rate of inflation , see this [ relevant graph of consumer price index ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xajsoee ), 
  basically what is needed is a boost of efficiency and productivity to maintain the medium and long term sustainability of the system . 
  the current proposal is to go with the economies of scale where smaller service regions maintained by municipalities will be merged into larger ones to provide the services in their respective areas . 
  sounds simple but is all but . 
  and to add to the complexity there 's also the separate but related issue of municipal policy reform where small municipalities are encouraged to merge with their neighbourghs into larger ones - even with the prospect of forced mergers if nothing else works . 
  both reforms are big and simultaneously doubly so . 
  and both are opposed by many municipalities . 
  and of course many people living in the scarcely populated areas are afraid of losing services or having poorer access to them , and of reforms creating more disparities between regions . 
  imo the current proposal is bit half-assed and does not go far enough with the service region mergers by forming about 50 service regions . 
  when reforming it would be better to do it more profoundly while at it as we 're looking for long term sustainability here . 
  i 'd also like for the reformers to take a good look at denmark and sweden and their related reforms for lessons . 
  in case of denmark to see what works and what does not work when doing ( forced ) municipal mergers . 
  and to see the pros and cons of sweden 's health care reforms - for example their idea of using health care service cheques does sound interesting and perhaps implementing a finnish version would be helpful in maintaining the guarantee of accessible health care . 
  currently in finland the reform of the social and health care system is a big issue . 
  [ minister : if healthcare reform was easy , it would 've already happened ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/minister_if_healthcare_reform_was_easy_it_wouldve_already_happened/6994538 ), 
   especially considering almost all rapes in oslo , norway are committed by immigrants . 
  incorrect . 
   let 's discuss the problem , shall we ? 
  one of the biggest problems in discussion is stating ludicruously exaggerated claims as facts . 
  i 'll wipe that froth out when you stop yelling, 
  so he does feel a bit uneasy about the protests in ukraine . 
  apparently it hits too close to home . 
  symbolic ` amnesty ' . 
  how lovely . 
  he 's gon na tighteng his grip over opposition . 
  what else is there to do . 
  putin 's more afraid that before . 
  `` i do not understand why nato adopts such statements , '' `` i can not understand why such questions are asked , '' - russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov what i would like to understand is why did they send him there ? 
  he 's a smart person .
