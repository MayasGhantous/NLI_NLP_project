  russia could have gone with lower profile delegation , but for some reason they sent him the foreign minister , and he says he 's baffled . 
  i am very much baffled he says . 
  i do not understand , he says . 
  well , fuck you then . 
  soviet union/russia there 's a difference but where . 
  also : [ ukraine : boxer defuses dangerous confrontation in kiev ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-protesters-government-kiev-20131201,0,4513808.story#axzz2mgvtf9bf ), 
  or perhaps with a bit of anxiety too . 
  widespread open protest in ukraine may hit close to home . 
  within russia 's suppressed opposition some predict tightening government control in russia as a result , and do n't expect ukraine 's protests to spread over there : [ why ukraine 's revolution wo n't spread to russia ] ( http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/12/02/why-ukraines-revolution-wont-spread-to-russia/ ) [ * ukrainian protest / russian protest * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wbfpjhk ), 
   how widespread is the unrest , and how much support is there for the protest movement in the russian-speaking parts of the country ( as opposed to the ukrainian-speaking parts ) ? 
  it really is n't that much a language issue ( see this thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rx6zm/linguistic_division_in_ukraine/ ) . 
  the protests are bigger and more wide spread in the western parts of ukraine , but there has also been protests , albeit smaller , in some of the eastern cities despite the bans in some . 
  it 's also important to remember that the protests are not only about the association agreement but also about the poor state of democracy and widespread corruption in ukraine . 
  for background i recommend reading this concise and informative assessment of the developments in ukraine since the independency : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 )  what specifically would be involved , and what specifically would ukraine receive , had the ukrainian government ratified the agreement at vilnius ? 
  here 's a short informative explanation of the association agreement : [ what exactly is an eu association agreement ? 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-association-agreement-explained/25174247.html ) among others it would give ukraine an acces to the eu 's over 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros . 
  the eu already is one of ukraine 's biggest trading partners , and the aa would be a big long term benefit for ukraine . 
  in 2012 the value of ukraine 's trade with the eu was $ 37.7 bn which is almost as big as trade with the whole cis blok at $ 38.2 bn , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3pgftlx ) ukraine 's exports to the eu are bigger than it 's exports to russia . 
  in 2012 ukraine 's exports to the eu were [ about $ 14.6 bn ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_113459.pdf ) and to the russia [ about $ 13.3 bn ( $ 18 bn ) ] ( http://rt.com/business/russia-ukraine-customs-eu-319/ ) . 
  see also [ the trade in 2011 ] ( http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/eu_ukraine/trade_relation/bilateral_trade/index_en.htm ) by the already existing agreements ( e.g. 
  gsp , mfn ) and short explanations of them . 
  the association agreement covers also other things and a signing country must adopt about 350 eu laws within ten years regarding trade , consumer protection , environmental regulation etc. 
  it also includes commitments to political , economic , trade , and justice system reforms which would reduce the powers of the oligrachy , promote democracy and make it more difficult to continue further to the authoritarian direction . 
  so the protesters also see the aa as a step away from the current authoritarian oligarchy and towards democracy . 
  the aa with related reforms would also be a huge boost to investments into ukraine . 
  currently the corruption , lawlessness regarding property and selective justice are big hurdles for foreign investment there . 
   what sort of pressure exactly is russia exerting ? 
  pretty much the same they always use plus we do n't know what else . 
  the ukrainian government has repeatedly said that russia has been putting a huge pressure on ukraine to drop the aa . 
  russia has used for example embargoes on ukrainian goods - breaking the wto rules in the process - and price of gas . 
  those mean economic losses to ukraine in short term at a time when its economy is not doing well at all . 
  currently ukraine gets roughly 60 % of its gas from russia . 
  during last few years , after many disputes with russia over gas , ukraine has been active in diversifying its supply . 
  latest development in this diversification strategy is negotiating a reverse-flow pipeline deal with slovakia : [ ukraine , slovak authorities still in gas-link talks ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/ukraine-slovakia-reverse-flow-gas-link-talks ) this pbs newshour has a short and pretty good analysis : [ why did ukraine 's yanukovych give in to russian pressure on eu deal ? 
  ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world/july-dec13/ukraine2_12-02.html )  how is moldova in a position to buck that pressure and sign the vilnius agreement ? 
  well , it exactly is n't in such a position . 
  after signing the aa moldovan representatives pretty much said that they hope russia will wait with their retaliation until after the sochi olympics . 
  otoh russia has done trade embargoes towards moldova for long enough that they have managed to an extent find new markets for their products already , which could soften the impact a little bit . 
  see for example this : [ moldova , georgia brace for russian retaliation after eu pact ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/feature/25184812.html ), 
  economy is often like a game of broken phone . 
  roubini says : `` now , five years later , * signs of frothiness , if not outright bubbles * , are reappearing in housing markets in switzerland , sweden , norway , finland , france , germany , canada , australia , new zealand , and , back for an encore , the uk ( well , london ) . '', 
  neil irwin interprets : `` these 17 countries * may have housing bubbles * . 
  if they pop , god help us all . '', 
  neutralgreek retells : `` switzerland , sweden , norway , finland , france , germany * have major housing bubbles * that if popped will sink european if not the world economy '', 
   i got those numbers completely out of my arse , but it is just for the purposes of example that shouting `` what the fuck '' without even looking into what sort of deal it is is completely stupid . 
  earlier this year russia ( or the company gazprom if you like ) threatened to hike the gas prices to armenia by 60 % : [ armenia 's gas bill may go up 60 % ] ( http://www.eurasianet.org/node/66966 ) armenia gets all its gas from russia as azerbaijan does n't want to sell gas to armenia , and there 's no significant pipelines from iran . 
  armenia tried to negotiate the price hike and at first managed to get it down to 18 % rise but only if it sells it 's stake in the joint venture armrusgazprom to the russians and not signing the association agreement . 
  russia essentially had a chokehold , armenia capitulated , joined the russia 's union and now russia controls both gas supply and distribution in armenia . 
  earlier armenia has tried to diversify its gas supply and there has been joint ventures and investments with some western companies to develop shale gas extraction in armenia . 
  i do n't know what will happen to those investments and ventures . 
   i see , but would n't the same thing happen if it was in the eu , if it 's main supplier was another eu country ? 
  there 's no such condition in the association agreement . 
   i read that russian is lingua franca between businesses in ukraine . 
  probably because most of the business elite and oligarchy is russian speaking - originating from the rigged privatizations which benefited few rather than created a proper market economy with free enterprise and competition . 
  here 's a good and concise assessment of the developments in ukraine since the independency : [ ukraine - political and economic lessons from democratic transitions ] ( http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/images/csmd_ebook/pathwaystofreedom/chapterpreviews/pathwaystofreedomukrainepreview.pdf#page=7 ), 
  yup , to china this week ( 3.-6 . ), 
  and after that to moscow . 
  also this : carl bildt [ @carlbildt ] ( https://twitter.com/carlbildt ) russia tv gets most things wrong . 
  nations at poltava . 
  me and westerwelle . 
  cia and agents . 
  not a stellar moment ... http://youtu.be/oknsbw2ptmy, 
  i read that as weirdo . 
  yeah , it 's difficult to say what 's gon na happen or what his current intentions are . 
  the prez yanukovich is going to china for 3.-6 . 
  december `` to prevent economic losses '' , and then to moscow for `` negotiations '' . 
  meanwhile the pm azarov says that his first deputy arbuzov is soon to go to brussels to negotiate and analyze the association agreement , and prepare for signing it . 
  then again , tomorrow is supposed to be the no-confidence vote in parliament and it 's unclear what the result will be . 
  might as well be that the government falls tomorrow and azarov becomes an ex-pm . 
  heh , remember the losses estimated by ukraine 's government and how the figures seemed to come from their asses ? 
  that 's probably because they were : http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/government-admits-helplessness-asks-for-a-new-deal-with-europe-332858.html  arbuzov , in his earlier briefing on dec. 1 indicated that ukrainians are prepared to be more flexible in negotiations . 
  while previously , the government told eu it had no way to compensate for 160 billion euro of estimated losses ukraine would incur in case it signs an association agreement , now arbuzov said the actual figure is closer to 10 billion euro . 
  yep , as confirmed by the recent huge mass demontrations for russia 's union . 
  no , wait . 
  in other news the euromaidan has left putin a bit sour . 
  according to him the events in ukraine `` do n't resemble a revolution , but a pogrom '' : http://lenta.ru/news/2013/12/02/putin/ he left unclear if the protests are also teh holocaust . 
  i do n't think yanukovich can afford another about-turn after this . 
  his political support is eroding , people are protesting and it 's not just about signing the aa any more - it 's about him resigning . 
  that guy is now in the ropes fighting for his political survival and his position does not seem strong for continuing with the same tactic . 
  lilia shevtsova from carnegie moscow center has a spot-on assessment of the events so far ( before the phone call ) : [ it is ukraine again ] ( http://carnegie.ru/eurasiaoutlook/?fa=53759 )  the current ukrainian awakening is a test for europe and its ability to reenergize itself and acquire a mission . 
  its mission today is to help find ukraine a peaceful way out of the confrontation . 
  ukrainian new revolution is also a warning to the russian regime -- in the end russia could prove that it can follow the same route , only much later ... 
  relevant ec press release about the phone call : [ results of a phone conversation between the president of ukraine viktor yanukovych and the president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-1196_en.htm ), 
  yep , it is true - he did call barroso and asked to discuss the aa . 
  here 's the ec press release about the conversation : [ results of a phone conversation between the president of ukraine viktor yanukovych and the president of the european commission jos\u00e9 manuel barroso ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-1196_en.htm ) is it a sign of desperation ? 
  a fishing expedition to buy time ? 
  interesting times . 
  there are many reports that yanukovich is losing support , but the extent of it unknown . 
  if correct , this is very interesting new development : konsiczky zolt\u00e1n [ @konsiczkyz ] ( https://twitter.com/konsiczkyz ) 19 min #yanukovich calls @barrosoeu , wants to send delegation to discuss `` some aspects '' of aa and dcfta @barrosoeu : agreement already initialled , ready to discuss implementation , not to reopen any kind of negotiations #ukraine #euromaidan, 
   doncha like the russians ? 
  i do n't think he meant russians the people but the authoritarian government of russia of which the article is about . 
  yup , it is a far-right nationalist party . 
  here 's an year-old nyt article about them and their leader : [ ukraine 's ultranationalists do well in elections - nytimes.com ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/world/europe/ukraines-ultranationalists-do-well-in-elections.html?_r=0 ), 
  these policemen are with the protesters . 
  indeed the provokers were only a tiny group , and apparently well prepared for their deed . 
  on the live feed i noticed how the protesters actually tried to prevent them from attacking the police . 
  they even lined up and formed a chain between the provokers and the police . 
  the amazing part was when that giant guy appeared : [ ukraine : boxer defuses dangerous confrontation in kiev ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-protesters-government-kiev-20131201,0,4513808.story#axzz2mgvtf9bf ), 
  also journalists have been beaten by the police . 
  the number of injured journalists is now up to 46 .
