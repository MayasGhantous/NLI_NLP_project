  well , whatever floats their boat . 
  they 're probably using the confused reporting in dutch media yesterday . 
  yes , there actually has been a dutch submarine in the area * a week ago * - days before the ongoing search . 
  people spotted and photographed it last monday : [ here 's a photo ] ( http://gfx2.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/19716274/485/normal/b47bec1245444/ub%c3%a5t2.jpg ) , and it does n't look like the vessel in the photo taken yesterday . 
  that was dutch walrus-class submarine hnlms bruinvis . 
  among with other royal netherlands navy ships hnlms zeeland , evertsen , and amsterdam it was participating in joint military exercises with the swedish navy . 
  last monday , after the excercises , the dutch vessels left stocholm . 
  days later , when the ongoing search of underwater activity started , people were sending photos they had taken days earlier asking what sub is that . 
  and on friday the swedish defence forces confirmed that those old pictures are of a dutch submarine . 
  here 's the relevant article from friday : https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article19716276.ab then two days later on sunday dutch media saw that article and mistook it to mean that according to swedish defence forces the vessel they 're currently searching for may be dutch . 
  perhaps there was something lost in translation . 
  here 's a relevant thread from yesterday , which op removed after learning what the original news was really about : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jp563/russian_submarine_might_be_dutch/, 
  * proof remember , it 's * proof * in pro-putinspeak , not evidence . 
  used in sentences as : where 's the proof ? 
  you do n't have proof . 
  show me the proof . 
  swedish defence forces published [ a map of sightings . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xehztry.png ) kanholmsfj\u00e4rden , object , friday before noon n\u00e4md\u00f6fj\u00e4rden , object , friday afternoon jungfrufj\u00e4rden , object , sunday before noon ( [ photo ] ( http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/siteassets/6-aktuellt/bild1.jpg ) ) also other maps and info was released in the same presser : http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/siteassets/6-aktuellt/141019-pressuppdatering-ver2.pdf, 
  except that submarines actually exist . 
   does this contradict the statements of gorbachev in the article ? 
  hans-dietrich genscher , as the german foreign minister in 1990 , can make agreements regarding germany but he is certainly not in a position to make agreements or promises on behalf of nato or other countries willing to apply for nato membership . 
  and it would have been incredibly silly and naive for gorbachev or shevardnadze to believe otherwise . 
  here 's the hi-res photo on swedish defence forces website : http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/siteassets/6-aktuellt/bild1.jpg the photo was taken on sunday before noon . 
  the location ( jungfrufj\u00e4rden ) is marked on the map released in the same presser : http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/siteassets/6-aktuellt/141019-pressuppdatering-ver2.pdf and for comparison purposes here 's couple of archive images of a russian triton-nn mini submarine : http://i.imgur.com/vvx5bbe.jpg http://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/19720098/742/normal/0ff10c6668732/miniu.jpg imo could be a triton in the photo but too blurry to say for sure . 
  here 's another old archive photo of a triton-nn : http://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/19720098/742/normal/0ff10c6668732/miniu.jpg could be a triton in the photo released today but too blurry to say for sure . 
   if it sank in a deep place then r.i.p. 
  the crew . 
  yep , if that happened in deep water they 'd be in trouble . 
  but within the archipelago the waters are shallow . 
  the photo was taken today before noon . 
  and if the eyewitness observation is correct , that the vessel run on surface and then submerged , does n't look like it 's in danger of sinking anyway . 
  yep , their positions have not updated for several hours now . 
  additionally , based on their location history , the dutch navy ships may sail long periods without ais . 
  the swedish navy just released a photo that apparently has a white vessel resembling a ( triton ? ), 
  minisub : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0u1ubxicaawchr.png:large the eyewitness who took the picture said he saw a white vessel and it submerged after taking the image . 
  swedish navy says they believe the picture shows `` some kind of submarine conning tower '' .

  it 's also possible that ns concord is working as comms relay . 
  indeed . 
  and actually also hnlms zeeland , evertsen , and amsterdam were participating in the same exercises with the swedish navy . 
  i linked their location history putting them in stockholm a week ago [ in this comment . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jmrh8/intercepted_distress_call_points_to_there_being_a/cldr0fr ) as to hnlms bruinvis ' current location - well , submarines do not usually broadcast that on ais . 
  but we do know there was an exercise a week ago in the swedish archipelago and hnlms bruinvis participated . 
  i think someone may be confusing things here . 
  the submarine spotted and photographed on ** monday ** in the swedish archipelago was indeed dutch walrus-class submarine hnlms bruinvis . 
  among with other royal netherlands navy ships it was participating in exercises with the swedish navy . 
  the exercises ended a week ago already . 
  and according to the ais data ns concord arrived to the area already in october 4th with danish straits as stated destination : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0qsmy3ciaalipf.png ( [ source ] ( https://twitter.com/defencechemist/status/523592056523218944 ) ) so , it has been in the area for two weeks . 
  now that 's a very long time for a tanker to be casually circling around looking for danish straits . 
  and there 's also another ship of interest to follow : russian marine research vessel professor logachev , which is apparently being followed by three royal netherlands navy ships . 
  [ these comments have additional info . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jmrh8/intercepted_distress_call_points_to_there_being_a/cldkyzg ), 
  yep , there 's actually * three * royal netherlands navy ships in the vicinity of professor logachev , [ screengrab . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0uds3_iyaau_c3.jpg ) [ the holland-class offshore patrol vessel hnlms zeeland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holland-class_offshore_patrol_vessels ) [ the de zeven provinci\u00ebn-class frigate hnlms evertsen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_zeven_provinci%c3%abn-class_frigate ) [ the replenishment ship hnlms amsterdam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hnlms_amsterdam_%28a836%29 ) the ships were in stockholm oct 12-13th , arrived outside tallinn oct 17th , participated in military operations ( drill ? ), 
  near naissaar , and left tallinn this morning . 
  here 's their location history for the last 7 days : [ hnlms zeeland ] ( http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&amp;z=10&amp;call=i%2f245288000&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800 ) [ hnlms evertsen ] ( http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&amp;z=13&amp;call=i%2f244942000&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800 ) [ hnlms amsterdam ] ( http://aprs.fi/#!call=i%2f245987000&amp;timerange=604800&amp;tail=604800 ) not sure if their current mission actually is to follow professor logachev but that would make sense in the circumstances . 
   the question is why do the germans even mention it in an ambiguous way like this , when there 's so much evidence for the other one ? 
  it 's the spiegel journalist or translator putting it ambigiuously . 
  that particular sentence is not a quote from the bmd chief . 
  and according to the ais data ns concord arrived to the area already in october 4th with danish straits as stated destination : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0qsmy3ciaalipf.png ( [ source ] ( https://twitter.com/defencechemist/status/523592056523218944 ) ) now that 's a long time for a tanker to be casually circling around looking for danish straits . 
  and here 's another ship of interest to follow . 
  the marine research vessel professor logachev left st.petersburg yesterday oct 18 @ 13:03 utc , visited kronstadt @ 15:12 utc , and is currently heading west towards the area : http://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/professor-logachev-imo-8834691-mmsi-273456410 also on marinetraffic : http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:24.15343/centery:59.7516/zoom:8/mmsi:273456410 professor logachev 's stated destination is las palmas ( eta : dec 05 , 10:00 ) . 
  now , that may be true , and the vessel has actually [ visited las palmas several times in 2012 ] ( http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=1311302 ) . 
  but the stated destination is n't necessarily the real destination - as also ns concord shows . 
  i do n't know if professor logachev actually is related to the events or if it 's just a coincidence . 
  but what 's suspicious here is 1 ) the timing , 2 ) the fact that the ship visited kronstadt which has a naval base of russian baltic fleet , and 3 ) the fact that the ship has capabilities to work with mini submarines . 
  professor logachev has an array of relevant instruments and also a heavy cargo boom for rov operation with lift capacity of 16 tons : http://www.soundocean.com/cgge/rv-professor-logachev so , let 's see if professor logachev is actually heading to las palmas . 
  and not only nice and caring but according to russians he 's also the top moral authority : [ vladimir putin seen by russians as highest moral authority ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/putin-is-top-moral-authority-for-russians-poll-shows/507773.html ), 
  one more tiem : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jofxp/german_intelligence_says_it_can_proof_that_pro/cldmdex yes , the article and the bnd says separatists fired the missile that brought mh17 down . 
  there has already been plenty of evidence pointing to the separatists , and now also the bnd has said to have unambigous evidence of it . 
  nowhere in the article does bnd say that the captured buk was used in shooting mh17 down . 
  it only says that the separatists were in possession of a captured buk system ( and we have known that from the very beginning ) . 
  if there was unambigous evidence showing that it was that very buk system which was used to shoot mh17 down they would have said so , as that would be big news . 
   is this correct ? 
  in numerous opinion polls teachers have usually been in the top ten in finland . 
  for example , # 5 in this one : http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2010122812914790_uu.shtml ( sorry , in finnish ) but otoh a recent international survey conducted by varkey gems foundation said that teachers have higher status in some other european countries than finland : [ the global teacher status index ] ( https://www.varkeygemsfoundation.org/teacherindex ) ( dat china ), 
   i should have written that ... or you should have copied the original headline without your personal editorializing at all : * deadly ukraine crash : german intelligence claims pro-russian separatists downed mh17 * you do n't even need to * write * the title for a post , you can simply let reddit copy it as is . 
  it 's just op 's editorialized headline . 
  yes , the problem with the editorialized headline is not who shot mh17 down . 
  there has already been plenty of evidence pointing to the separatists , and now also the bnd has said to have unambigous evidence of it . 
  the problem with the editorialized headline is this part : `` with an ukrainian buk air defense missile system . '', 
  nowhere in the article does bnd say that the captured buk was used in shooting mh17 down . 
  it only says that the separatists were in possession of a captured buk system ( and we have known that from the very beginning ) . 
  if there was unambigous evidence showing that it was that very buk system which was used to shoot mh17 down they would have said so , as that would be big news . 
   bnd president gerhard schindler provided ample evidence to back up his case , including satellite images and diverse photo evidence . 
  a wealthy customer appears : [ saudi arabia to import finnish education expertise ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/saudi_arabia_to_import_finnish_education_expertise/6499687 ), 
   german intelligence says it can proof that pro russian separatists shot down the mh17 with an ukrainian buk air defense missile system . 
  editorialized headline . 
  does n't say that anywhere in the article . 
  it says :  the bnd has intelligence indicating that pro-russian separatists captured a buk air defense missile system at a ukrainian military base and fired a missile on july 17 that exploded in direct proximity to the malaysian aircraft , which had been carrying 298 people . 
  the bnd has evidence showing that the separatists captured a buk system . 
  ( yes , we 've all known that already ) 2 . 
  and that their evidence shows the separatists fired the missile . 
  ( and yes , there has already been ample evidence pointing to them ) nowhere did the article or bnd say that the separatists used the captured buk system to shoot mh17 down , just that the separatists had captured one . 
  not much new there . 
  the news here is that the bnd 's evidence shows it was the separatists :  `` it was pro-russian separatists , '' the head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , has told parliament of the crash cause . 
  ...  bnd president gerhard schindler provided ample evidence to back up his case , including satellite images and diverse photo evidence . 
   i thought linus was finnish ? 
  they both are swedish speaking finns , referring to their mother tongue and the second national language of finland .
