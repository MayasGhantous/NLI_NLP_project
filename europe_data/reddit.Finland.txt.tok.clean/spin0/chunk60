   is n't ukraine completely reliant on russia for natural gas ? 
  currently ukraine gets roughly 60 % of its gas from russia . 
  during last few years , after many disputes with russia over gas , ukraine has been active in diversifying its supply . 
  latest development in this diversification strategy is negotiating a reverse-flow pipeline deal with slovakia : [ ukraine , slovak authorities still in gas-link talks ] ( http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/ukraine-slovakia-reverse-flow-gas-link-talks ) generally , on a long term , i think gazprom ( i.e. 
  putin ) is making a mistake by not behaving like a normal company in treatment of its customers . 
  blackmail is not a good long term strategy as options do exist . 
  yup , on the livestream i saw protesters lining up between the police and the rioters , and the confrontation dissolved . 
  here 's an account of the incident : [ ukraine : boxer defuses dangerous confrontation in kiev ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-protesters-government-kiev-20131201,0,4513808.story#axzz2mgvtf9bf ), 
   there were no confirmed reports about the whereabouts of mr yanukovich , who was due to fly to china on an offical visit on monday , the ukrainian president is under fire for his centralisation of power , for the jailing of opposition leader yulia tymoshenko and for widespread corruption . 
  his spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment . 
  but speaking on condition of anonymity , several government advisers conceded he could be toppled . 
   `` the next few days will be critical , clearly , '' said timothy ash , an analyst at standard bank . 
  `` the opposition appear to now have momentum on their side and will aim to use this to their advantage . 
  yanukovich faces the choice of either trying to re-impose control through the use of the security services or police , or negotiation . ''  ... stepan havrysh , a political commentator and former deputy national security chief , said in an afternoon television interview : `` the people 's peaceful demonstrations have transformed into a revolutionary state . ''  `` there is no more trust in the president '' from the people or his political allies , mr havrysh added , saying that a handful of once loyal lawmakers were leaving his party . 
   he predicted that the president would probably lose his majority in parliament within days . 
   mykhailo volynets , leader of ukraine 's independent coalminers ' union which has a big membership in mr yanukovich 's heartland of industrial eastern ukraine , said a split in the country was unlikely . 
   `` people in eastern ukraine are also very disillusioned in mr yanukovich and his ways . 
  they are not getting their salaries on time . 
  they are tired of this oppression . 
  they wo n't stand up for him , '' he said . 
  right now some protesters are taking down the lenin monument in bessarabska square . 
  there was a short clash with the police protecting the statue , but the police pulled back and left the monument . 
  edit : video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig2tjgfos5m the police regrouped but pulled mostly back again , now negotiating with the protesters near the statue . 
   ukraine did not say no to europe and yes to russia yet according to the pm azarov president yanukovich is going to go to moscow and agree on a `` roadmap '' . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  road to where ? 
   can not find the polls here 's the three different polls from sept , oct and nov and an analysis of them : [ viktor yanukovych : losing europe ... and losing the ukrainian public ?

   why / r/europe is n't discussing it ?!, 
  i would but i 'm too buzy following the events atm . 
  police reports about 100 police injured in the clash earlier , number of injured protestors unknown . 
  says they 're currently negotiating about the return of seized buildings . 
  [ police report injuries , negotiate return of seized buildings ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/police-report-injuries-negotiate-return-of-seized-buildings-332750.html ), 
  that one looks like an old image to me . 
  edit : [ this one is from tonight ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uamroy2 ), 
  near the presidential building the riot police has dismantled their barricade and now seems to be in process of retreating a bit . 
  so far no new clashes over there .

  edit2 : berkut dispersed the attackers near presidential building and shoved them back . 
  edit3 : police/interior ministry says that 1.6 m people have been demonstrating in kyiv and 200-300 t in independence square . 
   it 's just a 20 page paper i have to write for a research methods class ah , okay . 
  if i may make an suggestion i think you should consider the quite large variation within countries when iterpreting the anecdotes to put them into perspective . 
  for example , here in finland about 10 % of population are absolutists who do n't drink alcohol at all , and on the other extreme there 's the heavy drinkers : about 10 % who consume 50 % of all alcohol . 
  which leaves the rest of it to the about 80 % majority of moderate drinkers . 
  you mean as compared to russia 's union ? 
   the passport looks pretty good . 
  yeah , well , finland 's passport has an animated moose that [ walks ] ( http://imagicdigital.com/images/finflip.gif ), 
  i 'm curious as to why do you , as a researcher , consider internet anecdotes as a useful source for your research ? 
  not sure if this is helpful but here 's link to national institute for health and welfare : http://www.thl.fi/en_us/web/en they have studied alcohol consumption in finland quite extensively , including the social aspects of it , and i believe if you contact them they 'll share relevant results , research or data . 
  the official excuse is even sillier . 
  the police says they had to empty the square because the protesters were preventing the city workers from [ erecting a christmas tree on the square ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/reports-police-forcefully-break-up-protest-site-on-maidan-nezalezhnosti-this-morning-332674.html ) . 
  therefore : * [ `` choke on your christmas tree '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rbvi2d7 ) *, 
  it means visa-free travel to schengen area for up to three months with the biometric passport without needing a short-stay visa , see [ visa policy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/ ) . 
  incidentally also russia has been long asking for that : [ russia to push for visa-free regime deal with eu in 2014 -- official ] ( http://en.ria.ru/russia/20131017/184199636/russia-to-push-for-visa-free-regime-deal-with-eu-in-2014--official.html ) but now it seems that moldova will get it first . 
  it depends on so many factors that there 's no way to predict it with accuracy . 
  and as past week has demonstrated surprising last minute about turns can happen . 
  for eu membership we 're looking at a timeframe of at least 15 but rather 20 years or longer . 
  but assuming no big shits hit the fans , and progress continues in a two step ahead and one step back manner but nevertheless continues , my pure guesses for possible eu memberships would be : moldova 15-20 years ukraine 20 years georgia 20-25 years but that 's just guessing , no more - not an analysis . 
  could be faster , could be slower - that depends on many factors . 
  62 % in 4:50 : / identifying the general region ( north/south/east / west ) was relatively easy but pointing out which state it is on the map proved to be a lot more difficult even with the hints and all . 
  going to play a few more times just to educate myself . 
  yeah , the angry xenophobic driving instructor with his conspiracy theories is a wondeful comedic character indeed . 
  actor eddie marsan won the chlotrudis award , the national society of film critics award , and the london film critics circle award for his performance as scott the driving instructor with anger problems . 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/happy-go-lucky#awards ), 
  georgia gets its gas from azerbaijan through [ south caucasus pipeline ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/baku_pipelines.svg/800px-baku_pipelines.svg.png ) i do n't know to what extent russia controls the fauchet in baku , but to me it seems that georgia has not that bad strategical position on the matter as the pipeline from azerbaijan to turkey runs through it . 
  perhaps not exactly escapism but lotsa charming lightness : [ happy-go-lucky ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045670/ ), 
  just to point out an obvious one : association agreement gives an access to the eu 's over 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros . 
  russia 's union has only 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
  [ georgia , moldova endorse eu association agreements ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/georgia-initial-eu-association-agreement-summit-vilnius/25183240.html )  the process leaves one page to be ceremonially initialed during the second day of summit proceedings in the lithuanian capital before more work that allows actual signings months or years down the road . 
   georgian first deputy foreign minister david zalkaliani , who is leading his country 's delegation in vilnius , told rfe/rl that the initialing of the some 1,000-page document means it is already an irrevocable agreement . 
  so in the summit moldova and georgia are going to sign the ~ ~ first ~ ~ last page of their respective association agreements . 
  the signing the rest of the 1,000 page agreement will take longer and the pace of progressing on it depends . 
  but the initial signing of the agreements is very good news indeed . 
  and the georgian representative calling it ` irrevocable ' already . 
  lotsa interesting tidbits about the vilna summit in the [ live blog : eastern partnership summit in vilnius ] ( http://www.rferl.org/contentlive/eastern-association-summit-vilnius-ukraine/25183731.html ) such as [ @carlbildt ] ( https://twitter.com/carlbildt ) * `` president yanukovich must show what we wants . 
  rumours he has promised to leave european energy community . 
  would kill association agreement . 
  '' * also live news , analyses and opinions on the [ eastbook.eu -- portal on eastern partnership ] ( http://eastbook.eu/en/ ) and congrats moldova and georgia !,

  edit : this just in [ yanukovych still wants eu accord ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-eu-/25183983.html ), 
  we do n't talk much .
