   because of its exceptionally rich noun case system , whereby nouns take on different suffixes based on their place in a sentence . 
  for example here 's [ the 2,253 different word-forms of the finnish noun kauppa ( * shop * ) . 
  ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) tbf many of them are rarely if ever used but they 're all grammatically correct and do have their meanings and/or nyances . 
  yet in one short lesson with only two simple words you have just learned to say eight different things in finnish . 
   edit will you listen to the economist ? 
  then read this interesting article comparing finland and sweden . 
  hold your horses . 
  that article does not provide any analysis that finland 's problems were due to euro . 
  instead it lists various reasons such as : * changes in global markets * loss of competitiveness as unit labour costs have shot up by 20 % in the past five years * need to improve public-service productivity which is pretty much what anyone familiar with relevant economic indicators know . 
  while it is true that cheaper $ might improve finnish exports a bit ( which , btw , is not a simple correlation and such claims need their own in-depth analyses ) there are other much bigger factors that affect finland 's economic performance that need to be remedied . 
  and unlike you imply there 's no simple patent medicine to deal with those problems , they need wider structural reforms . 
   perchance it was me using expressions like i 'm expecting and i bet that ? 
  because you 're absolutely right !, 
  yup . 
   however you have to admit that the post itself is rather biased , however , you judging a film which you have n't even seen is not biased at all . 
  / s but good to hear it 's now on your watchlist . 
   do you want to bet that no humane russian will be mentioned of in this film ? 
  i bet you have n't actually seen the film . 
   after all , germany was n't exactly nice to poland in ww2 , but somehow i only read news about poland and germany it generally has to do with good and mutually beneficial trade . 
  that 's probably because germany has acknowledged the atrocities done under the nazi regime . 
  they have not denied them from existing . 
  instead they have apologized and made amendments . 
  and that 's decent and the least thing you can do . 
  quite unlike soviet union/russia . 
  better to read the report : [ oecd economic surveys - greece , november 2013 ] ( http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/grc_overview_eng_2013.pdf )  dealing with growth obstacles through further structural reforms :  major structural reforms have been introduced in several domains , but more needs to be done . 
  a rapid , sustained and inclusive recovery is key to debt sustainability , employment creation and easing the social costs of the crisis . 
  major restructuring and recapitalisation of banks have provided the basis for credit provision to the economy . 
  however large portfolios of bad assets continue to weigh on credit supply , especially to small and medium enterprises ( smes ) . 
  although administrative burdens have been already somewhat reduced , remaining product market impediments continue to hinder further improvements in price competitiveness , and further reallocation of resources towards exports is needed . 
  reform of the public administration has been slow , however efforts to address the serious inefficiencies of the large public service have recently accelerated . 
  tax evasion remains a key concern . 
  the judicial process is improving , but it is still slow and costly . 
  important reforms in legislation and procedures have taken place , but their effectiveness can only be appreciated in the next few years . 
  continuous monitoring and evaluation of the reform process is of crucial importance . 
  oecd 's key recommendations . 
  economic recovery * accelerating and broadening the structural reform programme is essential for sustainable recovery . 
  in this respect , stronger reform ownership by all line-ministries , a better coordination of reform implementation and enhanced monitoring and evaluation of reform outcomes are essential . 
  evaluation results should be disseminated . 
  * implement fiscal consolidation measures as planned . 
  if growth is weaker than expected , let the automatic stabilisers operate . 
  * if negative macroeconomic risks materialise and nominal growth proves weaker than expected , even with full and timely implementation of structural reforms , serious consideration should be given to further assistance to achieve debt sustainability . 
  * enhance management of troubled assets and maximise recoveries in order to increase banks ' ability to grant credit in the medium term . 
  dealing with obstacles to growth * further reduce administrative burdens to promote investment . 
  continue streamlining administrative procedures for exports and imports and simplifying licensing procedures . 
  * accelerate the privatisation programme , in particular in energy , railways , regional airports , ports and real estate . 
  this should be accompanied by swift progress in liberalisation to avoid the creation of private monopolies and to boost efficiency and growth . 
  * step up the fight against tax evasion by stopping tax amnesties , identifying and punishing evaders , and improving the effectiveness of audits . 
  improve the judicial system by overhauling and streamlining the civil code and making more use of out-of-court mediation systems . 
  * further enhance the efficiency of public administration , inter alia , through the development of e-government and the evaluation of staff performance based on clear individual objectives . 
  fairly sharing the costs and benefits of adjustment * enhance governance of social programmes by speeding up the consolidation of the management of social insurance funds and accelerating harmonisation of information systems across the funds , which is essential for targeting benefits to protect the most vulnerable . 
  * target selected social benefits more efficiently and introduce a properly targeted minimum income scheme . 
  * focus health care cuts on reducing inefficiencies , while avoiding cuts on efficient and critical programmes . 
  * tackle high unemployment , especially among youth , by strengthening activation programmes and evaluating their effect in promoting employment to focus on the successful ones . 
  strengthen the effectiveness of the labour inspection system , as planned , to ensure full enforcement of the labour code , and step up inspections and sanctions . 
  way to go , guys !, 
  \\ o / on behalf of europe : thank you thank you thank you . 
  and congratulations . 
   the point the article is trying to make is that there is nothing exceptional about russian demographics , yes , i understood the purpose of the blogpost . 
  what i 'm saying is that his comparison is flawed and as such does not much help his case . 
  he cherrypicks a subset favourable for his comparison to support his point . 
  not an honest way to go about it , and makes me very cautios about this guy 's analyses . 
  and he does the same in the other blogpost you just linked . 
  he creates subsets favourable to his point . 
  he composes and then compares subsets `` western europe '' and `` eastern europe '' to the * whole * russian federation . 
  and totally forgets that the eu population is actually growing . 
  that is flawed analysis . 
  simple rule of thumb in statistics : it is always possible to cherrypick such a subset that when compared to another whole , the comparison may appear favourable to your point or agenda . 
  the reader should always be cautious when someone presents subsets . 
  in reality the population growth rate in the eu is positive , and bigger than in russia where it 's negative . 
  and just for the record : i 'm not claiming that the negative rate in the russian federation means imminent collapse or such . 
  what i 'm saying is that this guy 's analyses are flawed and misleading . 
  yup , it 's bullshit . 
  and the op / u/moonmetropolis failed to back it up with any relevant data . 
   ** if ** the idea of the eu emerged as a way to ensure peace between the traditional enemies of france and germany with the european coal and steel community ( and you could even go further back for ideas related to a broader european community ) in the 1950s , i 'm curious as to whether the application of an idea meant for such a specific region can continue growing unabated ? 
  i bolded the operative word . 
  the ecsc between belgium , france , west germany , italy , the netherlands and luxembourg was the first supranational organ , one practical implementation of an idea , one aspect of it . 
  that does not mean it 's all there was to it . 
  for example already in 1946 churchill in [ his speech ] ( http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html ) called for ' a kind of united states of europe ' . 
  certainly tying the economies together , especially between traditional rival countries , was and still is ( e.g. 
  $ ) an important part of ensuring peace . 
  but it is not all there is to european integration , and treating it as such can lead to an incomplete analysis . 
   in this way , i 'm quite interested in the idea that distributing wealth can be satisfactorily done ** at a national level ** without consideration of rural-urban dynamics , disparate economy types ( dominantly fishing versus industry ) , etc. 
  incidentally , this was one of the controversies over the accession of croatia in the summer -- most benefits would be experienced by those in the coastal regions and not in places like vukovar in the east . 
  the operative part bolded . 
  national level policies are the most important part of distributing benefits and wealth between regions in a member state , and it is mostly up to croatia how its different regions will benefit of the eu membership . 
  the eu will provide funding for regional development through mechanisms such as cohesion funding and cap . 
   if a parent wants to impart his or her religious traditions to his or her child , i can see no reason why the state should interfere . 
  do you apply your stated principle to all religious traditions ? 
  or are you committing a special pleading fallacy ? 
   it 's illegal everywhere , fgm is not illegal everywhere . 
  but it is illegal for example in norway and the nordic countries . 
  afaik even a nip without permanent injury on a girl 's genitals is illegal . 
   and still goes on a lot . 
  it happens somewhat to girls born in the nordic countries , but it is getting rarer - although i have n't seen recent stats on it . 
   i am not saying at all that it should be legalized , just that it is n't stopping anyone . 
  that applies to all laws , because laws are made of words . 
  a law can not prevent anyone from breaking it . 
  the purpose of a law criminalizing an act is to give legal basis to prosecute for such acts , and to give legal protection for the victim who will then have the ability to report a crime and/or file charges . 
  for example : criminalizing sexual assault does not prevent such acts from happening . 
  they do happen and often out of sight .
