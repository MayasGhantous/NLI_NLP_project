  but only if the act is defined as a crime in a law can the victim report a crime and the assaulter be arrested , prosecuted and sentenced . 
  when the act of infant circumcision without medical justification is criminalized then the persons commiting such act can be prosecuted . 
  law enforcement and justice system can take action upon it . 
  as a victim of a crime the child or someone on behalf of the child can report a crime and file charges against the suspected perpetrators ( doc , parents ) . 
  the victim gets protected . 
  the perpetrator ( s ) gets prosecuted . 
  that is the point of having such laws . 
  i get what he 's saying . 
  but that comparison does not do much to help his case because he 's comparing cherrypicked individual eu member states to the whole russian federation , which is not very good as comparisons go . 
  his comparison is apples to oranges , and using misleading statistics does not strengthen his point . 
  the eu has free movement of people and that is reflected in the demographics of individual member states : people do move from one country to another . 
  and as a whole the eu population is rising while in the russian federation it 's falling . 
  the blogpost seems to fail to mention that actually the eu is doing better than russia . 
  for the eu numbers the blogist used this newsrelease : [ eurostat - european demography ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-20112013-ap/en/3-20112013-ap-en.pdf )  eu28 population 505.7 million at 1 january 2013  more than 5 million babies born in the eu28 in 2012  on 1 january 2013 , the population of the eu28 was estimated at 505.7 million , compared with 504.6 million on 1 january 2012 . 
  this means that the population of the eu28 grew by 1.1 million in 2012 , an annual rate of +2.2 per 1 000 inhabitants , due to a natural increase of 0.2 million ( +0.4 \u2030 ) and net migration of 0.9 million ( +1.7 \u2030 ) . 
  the population growth rate in the eu is bigger than in russia where it 's negative . 
  for some reason he just picked the states with a loss bigger than the whole russia has . 
   uhhh ... last i checked , i never took a stance one way or the other . 
  it 's a pretty complex and controversial issue , in case you have n't noticed . 
  could you please provide recent data regarding the rate of infant circumcision in your listed countries ? 
  because your list is flawed as it is . 
  actually in africa the hiv rate among circumcised men have been observed to rise and the prevalence to surpass that of the uncircumcised men . 
  [ botswana hiv infection among circumcised men `` rises '' ] ( http://en.starafrica.com/news/botswana-hiv-infection-among-circumcised-men-rises.html ) and according to the 2010/2011 zimbabwe health demographic survey ( zdhs ) the hiv prevalence among all men 15-49 years old was 12 % with about 9.1 % of the men circumsized . 
  yet the hiv prevalence among circumcised men has risen to about 14 % . 
  and that 's a trend you 'd expect to get with a health-policy based on flawed science : [ when bad science kills , or how to spread aids ] ( http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-science-kills-or-how-to-spread-aids/ ), 
  your list seems bit off . 
  for example , infant circumcision is not common in the uk . 
  it may have been a fad at some point in history but not any more . 
  same goes with new zealand at least . 
  and in the philippines boys are often circumcised in later in their childhood/preteens commonly with only a dorsal slit without removal of any tissue . 
  they even have mass circumcision events for that over there : [ they 're smiling now ... filipino youths wait in line to take part in mass ` circumcision party ' world record attempt ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1384549/hes-smiling--filipino-youths-wait-line-mass-circumcision-party-world-record-attempt.html ) but medicalization may have made infant circumcision more common over there . 
  in south korea virtually no circumcisions were performed before 1945 as it was in fact against their confucian traditions . 
  the practice was exported over there by american soldiers . 
  after that boys have been circumcised most often in their preteens but now according to study [ decline in male circumcision in south korea ] ( http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/1067 ) the practice is in steep decline and the according to the study the * `` cause for this decline seems to be the increase in information available on the pros and cons of circumcision . 
  '' * so could you please provide recent data regarding the rate of * infant circumcision * in your listed countries , please ? 
  relevant data being the percentage of infant boys that are currently circumcised . 
  i do n't think it is common at all in many of them - except in the us . 
   i do n't think muslims do that , they do n't . 
  the circumcision of infants seems to be pretty modern thing among most muslims . 
  in most muslim traditions boys have been circumcised in their early teens as a rite of passage to adulthood/adolescence . 
  but under last few decades infant circumcision has become more common for some reason ( medicalization ? 
   just the jews and even then it 's not very common i do n't know how common the penis-sucking part ( metzitzah b ' peh ) actually is but apparently the chief rabbinate of israel deems it as important part of the ritual circumcision : [ israel 's chief rabbinate backs metzitzah b ' peh rite for bris ] ( http://www.jta.org/2013/04/24/news-opinion/world/israels-chief-rabbinate-backs-metzitzah-bpeh-rite-for-bris ) there has been controversies over the rite because it 's unhygienic and has caused infections . 
  one israeli study estimated that about a third of neonatal herpes infections were due to the practice , and it has caused even deaths in new york : * `` in new york , at least 11 boys contracted herpes from the practice between 2004 and 2011 , according to new york city health officials . 
  two died from the virus and two others suffered brain damage . 
   how hard can it be ? 
  stop mutilating children . 
  apparently not always easy , even if one wants to : [ israeli rabbinical court forcing divorc\u00e9e to circumcise son ] ( http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/israeli-rabbinical-court-forcing-divorcee-to-circumcise-son/2013/11/07/ ) * the woman argued that the rabbinical court does not have jurisdiction over her son . 
  * according to judges the infant 's identity would be `` incomplete and defective '' unless his penis is forced to be mutilated within seven days . 
   he claimed it was all true , all the faults of the immigrants trying to steal greek money . 
  not only claimed , he said he guarantees it . 
  i wonder if we can now return his flawed opinion and get a refund . 
   or the double quotes there mean that it 's not a real lgbt demonstration ? 
  well , by the notable lack of even a hint of any fabulousness in the procession i haphazardly guess it 's not a real lgbt rally . 
  so i go by the link 's assessment which translates to : * `` these people are involved in a provocative procession with the purpose to discredit ukraine 's european integration , the organizers tried to pass off as representatives of ukrainian gay community . 
  '' * which as a demonstrating tactic is as fascinating as it is alien to me . 
  i mean : wtf ? 
  * she tbf she did n't say exactly that . 
  according to the article she has said : `` with good information about risk , pain and lack of health benefits of the intervention , i think parents from minorities would voluntarily abstain from circumcising children '' . 
  the headline is jewish telegraphic agency 's interpretation . 
   are there really such advantages being in europe these days ? 
  just to point out one : association agreement gives an access to the eu 's 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros , while russia 's union has just 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
  the claim was indeed outlandish - though not unique . 
  some years ( or decades ? ), 
  ago there were similar claims related to cuba : that cuban youth were self-inflicting hiv for reasons i can not remember . 
  do n't know about the truthfulness of that one either . 
  unfortunately it happens , but hopefully the quick debunking restrics the damage . 
  incidently there was another hiv claim in / r/science today : [ 16 % of finnish population genetically hiv resistant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1rgmlj/16_of_finnish_population_genetically_hiv_resistant/ ) which is not exactly true either . 
  the graph you linked is apparently the suicide rates in all age groups . 
  it also uses single year datapoints which may be misleading due to annual variation , and does not show trends or averages . 
  for finland 's numbers see the statistics finland database [ suicides by age and gender 1921-2011 ] ( http://pxweb2.stat.fi/dialog/varval.asp?ma=090_ksyyt_tau_109&amp;amp;ti=suicides+by+age+and+gender+1921%2d2011&amp;amp;path=../database/statfin/ter/ksyyt/&amp;amp;lang=1&amp;amp;multilang=en ) i made a quick & dirty [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y1jqehi ) please note that it 's the number of them and not the rate - too lazy to do the rate per 100,000 population thingy , sorry . 
  edit : suicide is a complex phenomenom and does not have simple causes . 
  one has to be very careful with conclusions when looking for correlations . 
  your objection to the association agreement seems to be about how you think economy is currently going down in finland or europe . 
  yet the agreement is about trade . 
  there would be more of it , the markets would get larger and there would be more opportunities for economic activity for associated economies . 
  all of which are generally considered positive things for economy . 
  so could you please explain how more of those are in your opinion bad for economy ? 
  what kind of analysis have you conducted to come to that conclusion , or could you provide a link to it ? 
  association agreement is not a membership agreement or even a membership application . 
  he sounds a bit sour . 
   you people really think that european union voters are ready or even want to have new ( very ) poor members from east nor whatever part of europe ? 
  association agreement ( including it 's dcfta chapter ) is not a membership agreement or even a membership application . 
  here 's a [ quick explanation with further links ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rcgef/massive_attendance_at_a_proeu_demonstration_going/cdmkpdg ) . 
   soviets took their food and forbid anyone from leaving the country . 
   mismanagement . 
  i use logic and from your evasion i infer that you 're unable to show your claimed 15 to 50 thousand . 
   do these ( questionable ) polls relate to the reality of the things happening right now ? 
  polls show that majority prefers the eu over russia 's union . 
  at the same time i can not help but notice the lack of polls supporting your assertion that they do n't . 
  well then please do show an image with the claimed 15 to 50 thousand people . 
  neither of your links has such , in fact quite a lot less , and to me it does matter what i see . 
  do you see 15 to 50 thousand people in that image ? 
  because i certainly do not . 
  i think tymoshenko would be serious contender and she would probably win over yanukovych . 
  in other news it was reported that she has started a hunger strike : [ ukraine 's tymoshenko launches hunger strike ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-eu-russia-azarov/25178873.html )  jailed former prime minister yulia tymoshenko has launched a hunger strike in solidarity with ukrainian protesters rallying in kyiv for closer ties with the european union . 
   in a message to protesters , announced by her lawyer serhiy vlasenko , tymoshenko said , `` as a sign of unity with you i declare an unlimited hunger strike with the demand to yanukovych to sign the association agreement . '', 
   that 's mostly for the western ukrainians . 
  even in the southern and eastern ukraine majority supports joining the eu . 
  here 's brookings analysis quoting three different polls : [ viktor yanukovych : losing europe ... and losing the ukrainian public ?
