  october [ gfk ukraine poll ] ( http://www.gfk.ua/public_relations/press/press_articles/011218/index.ua.html ) shows three times the support for association agreement with the eu compared to russia 's customs union : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldjvevm ) [ september poll ] ( http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=rus&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=196&amp;page=1 ) by the kyiv international institute of sociology showed 41 % favoring the eu and 35 % russia 's customs union . 
  in demographic breakdown the support for the eu is biggest among the young while the old favour customs union : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/turo7c9 ), 
   http://rt.com/news/moldova-anti-eu-protest-210/ * `` the massive protest was organized by the oppositionist communist party which claimed attendance of more than 50 thousand people . 
  other sources estimate that only around 15 thousands protesters flocked to the main square of chisinau . 
  '' * 15 to 50 thousand ... [ riight ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gvete1n ) looks lot closer to 500 than `` thousands '' to me . 
   i decided to continue with ( un ) popular series that i hope that in your mission , whatever that may be , you also bear in mind that the purpose of the subreddit really is n't to serve as anyone 's personal soapbox for narrow political activism . 
  perhaps you confused imprisoned tymoshenko for someone else ? 
  interviews with survivors : [ in ukraine , holodomor 's terrors remain fresh in the minds of survivors ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-holodomor-famine-survivors/25178009.html )  the holodomor , as the famine is now known , was never officially acknowledged by soviet authorities , who said crop failure was to blame for any random accounts of starvation . 
   but as ukraine has been preparing to mark the 80th anniversary of the holodomor on november 23 , the few remaining survivors remember the famine as deliberate , sweeping , and filled with terror . 
  the eu already is one of ukraine 's biggest trading partners . 
  the association agreement includes better access to the eu common market and even more trade . 
  in 2012 the value of ukraine 's trade with the eu was $ 37.7 bn which is almost as big as trade with the whole cis blok at $ 38.2 bn , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3pgftlx ) ukraine 's exports to the eu are bigger than it 's exports to russia . 
  in 2012 ukraine 's exports to the eu were [ about $ 14.6 bn ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_113459.pdf ) and to the russia [ about $ 13.3 bn ( $ 18 bn ) ] ( http://rt.com/business/russia-ukraine-customs-eu-319/ ) . 
  [ trade in 2011 ] ( http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/eu_ukraine/trade_relation/bilateral_trade/index_en.htm ) by the current agreements ( e.g. 
  gsp , mfn ) :  the eu is ukraine 's second largest trading partner : in 2011 , 26,6 % of all ukrainian exports of goods went to the eu and 31,2 % of imports of goods came from the eu . 
  eu-ukraine trade in goods reached $ 36.6 billion in 2011 ( an increase of 1,1 % compared to 2010 ) . 
    the main goods ukraine exports to the eu are ferrous metals , iron ore , electric machinery and cereals . 
  the main goods the eu exports to ukraine are machinery , transport equipment , chemicals , textile and clothing , and agricultural products . 
    ukrainian exports to the eu are to a large extent already liberalised thanks to the generalised system of preferences ( gsp ) , which the eu granted to ukraine in 1993 . 
  in 2011 , total preferential exports to the eu under gsp amounted to 16.8 % of overall ukrainian exports by volume . 
  preferential imports include machinery and mechanical appliances , plants , oils , base metals , chemicals and textiles . 
  furthermore , there are sectors where the most favoured nation ( mfn ) duty applied by the eu is already zero ( around 42 % of all agricultural products can be sold duty-free by the ukrainian exporters on the eu market ) . 
    existing quantitative import restrictions on steel and textiles were cancelled on may 16 2008 when ukraine acceded to the wto . 
  since then ukraine enjoys unrestricted exports of steel and textiles to the eu . 
  the association agreement includes the deep and comprehensive free trade area ( dcfta ) chapter which would give ukraine even better access to the eu common market . 
  dcfta would give an access to the eu 's 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros , while russia 's customs union has just 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
  it also covers other things and a signing country must adopt about 350 eu laws within ten years regarding trade , consumer protection , environmental regulation etc. 
  [ explainer : what exactly is an eu association agreement ? 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-association-agreement-explained/25174247.html ) i really can not see how the eu could or would sweeten the deal from that . 
  offer bribes ? 
  or what ? 
   ` in 1990 , gorbachev finally admitted soviet guilt and put the blame on `` stalinism . '' ' ( and rightfully so ) . 
  if you want me to look for a text of apology or something go fuck yourself . 
  he did not express any apology . 
  like i already said , contrary to your claim there has never been an official apology . 
  and that 's probably why all you have left is to resort to insults when asked to show it . 
   whoa whoa what makes you so arrogant ? 
  go fuck yourself . 
  le reasoning . 
    so what ? 
  pointed out the denial . 
  that 's what . 
   ` communist party of russian federation ' is n't even ` communist ' by any measure , to begin with ( not that it 's in any way related to the issue ) . 
  ah , no true scotsmen . 
   and cold war era cliches like ` communists not big friends of truth , are they ? ', 
  are not a good look . 
  actually what is not `` a good look '' here is the denial . 
  it 's not cold war any more . 
  and they might look a bit better if they actually acknowledged the truth of the matter instead of denying it . 
  you have now posted this exact same comment five times already . 
  please do consider about when copy-pasta turns into spamming . 
   ( please , do n't show me those well known pictures , you know what they are , and they are easy to set up . ), 
  riiiight , it was all a set up . 
   there are two sides of the story . 
  and one of them is the idiot side with the ` it 's a setup ' conspiratard theory . 
   you know what ? 
  if it was in my power i would totally apologize for everything russians did and did n't just to get it done with . 
  why are ` russians ' as a collective held prisoners by whims of politicians they did n't even elect ? 
  \\* sigh \\* please do read again what i actually wrote , and if you want address that please do . 
   russia officially apologized for katy\u0144 , has n't happened . 
  your linked a news piece says ` russian parliament condemns stalin for katyn massacre ' . 
  now , the duma condemning stalin for something and the government officially apologizing are two very different things . 
  please show me the official apology by soviet or russian government . 
  it does n't exist as there has never been an official apology . 
  and about the denial . 
  for example the russian communist party in the duma still denies it . 
  right in the duma . 
  communists not big friends of truth , are they ? 
  and russia has never accounted for all the victims . 
  their investigation only accounted for 1,803 victims when in reality it 's well known fact that there 's more by a magnitude . 
   that is not a `` big '' crowd . 
  simple as that . 
  then it should be simple to explain what is your metric and how have you determined it ? 
  how many would be a `` big '' crowd and why ? 
   and you know what germans did ? 
  they burned my grandmas village and executed all of her relatives . 
  why ? 
  because they can . 
  and you know what germans also did ? 
  they publicly acknowledged the atrocities done under the nazi regime . 
  they have not denied them from existing . 
  instead they have apologized and made amendments . 
  why ? 
  because that 's the decent thing and the least thing you can do . 
  quite unlike what soviet union/russia has done with their propaganda of denial . 
  and again , he never claimed not having a right to walk about with megaphones . 
  i see you participate in the discussion in a bad faith , so i 'll just bail out just about here . 
  he did n't say that . 
  he said `` citizens of moldova ? 
  yes . '', 
  which is the opposite of what you claim he said . 
  some days ago etna was blowing [ ` smoke ' rings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sepw8kw.jpg ) cool images in [ this guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/18/mount-etna-volcano-blows-rings-in-pictures ) and over at [ national geographic ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/131114-mount-etna-blows-smoke-rings-volcano-italy-science/#/5_73450_990x742.jpg ) . 
  someone also shot a video of them : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbv98z0qp-k, 
   even if i presume that 50 % want to join the eu , it means that the other 50 % does n't . 
  it 's not black or white as there are also ` hard to say ' answers . 
  what the 50 % does mean is that majority supports joining the eu over russia 's union . 
   i would be interested to see graphs from regions like crimea , where 80 % of population is russian . 
  as opposed to southern and eastern regions with more balanced population . 
  sure , grab the goalposts and run with them . 
  your argument rested upon your following belief : `` the main reason for this is ukraine being divided into a pro-west part in the west , and pro-russian part in the south and east , that has 17 million native russian speakers . '',
