  you even stated it as your '' * main reason * '' . 
  joining the eu has majority support even in the areas you claimed would be the `` main reason '' that ukraine will never be under eu influnce . 
  and now that you 've been shown that this not the case you have shrunk it into crimea . 
  goalposts , who needs them anyway . 
   do n't forget that the question in the polls is eu membership , not what they were about to sign . 
  the fact that 37 % people think that ukraine can become a full member after 5 years just shows how uninformed they are . 
  riight , people just do n't know what they 're talking about when they support the eu over russia 's union . 
  that must be it . 
  misinformed . 
  if only they were better informed , then they would support union with russia and you 'd be correct in your claim . 
  but the fact is that majority does n't and your claim is incorrect , which is a bit unfortunate for your argument as it was the '' * main reason * '' . 
   if both eu and ukrainian specialists made analysis and showed what 's going to happen to ukraine in the short term without financial aid ( as well as from having bad relations with russia ) , people would be against this aa and trade treaty with eu . 
  from moving goalposts to fantasies . 
  what you 're doing now is fantasizing about imaginary future where your argument would hold true . 
  imaginary arguments are not arguments at all . 
  neither is setting imaginary conditions . 
   again , the eu is not seriously considering ukraine 's membership right now . 
  ukraine has not applied for a membership so there 's nothing to `` seriously consider '' . 
  currently ukraine is a eastern partnership country . 
  however , future membership is a possibility and has been since at least the mamaia summit . 
   so such polls are useless . 
  they 're indeed useful as they do measure ukrainans ' attitudes towards the future regarding the eu . 
  at the same time i can not help but notice the total lack of polls supporting your argument . 
  so it was n't five years ? 
  yes , i 've heard about long waiting lines in helsinki too . 
  personally i have n't experienced that as those i know have gotten an apartment very quickly when they needed it . 
  i even got one myself in only two weeks when i was in an urgent need . 
  but then again i 've also heard that some have had to wait for much longer even years . 
  the situation is not as bad as they have in stockholm but also helsinki does need more housing and social-housing construction . 
  what was amazing to me in the story was the ` did n't give * any * answer for five years ' part . 
  that sort of avoidance may take some dedication . 
   and by putting my argument close to goebbels ' rhetorical tricks , do n't you do exactly the same thing as you say i am doing ? 
  the circle is complete . 
  my objection was to point out the poor reasoning which i named . 
  i also pointed out the irony that your objection and goebbels ' rhetorics had a commonality . 
  but that is inconsequential to the point : the use of poor reasoning . 
  the reasonable objection would have been for example pointing out that things really are n't that black and white , and that in reality there exists a wider pool of reasonable options than the propagandist dichotomy of dead | | red . 
  it indeed is a silly and oversimplified catchphrase , but merely believing it was coined by goebbels himself is not a very good objection to it - nor does it give much context as the phrase has been used extensively during the cold war by many in many contexts and as different versions . 
  i hope if you engage those neo-nazis in a debate you could use some other reasoning than it was coined by goebbels . 
  anne applebaum is currently working on a book about holodomor 's history : [ new book to highlight ` well managed cover-up ' of ukrainian famine ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-holodomor-applebaum-book/25176662.html ) applebaum 's earlier book * gulag : a history * won the 2004 pulitzer prize and the duff-cooper prize . 
  and her latest book * iron curtain : the crushing of eastern europe 1944-1956 * just won the 2013 cundill prize for historical literature . 
  so i take it her book about the holodomor will likely be interesting . 
  but the positive sign is that compared to 2013 ukraine has improved [ by 28 ranks . 
  ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/ukraine/ ), 
  goebbels is dead . 
  and the phrase ` better dead than red ' has been used quite extensively in quite many contexts in the west during the cold war and even after . 
  we do n't actually know for certain if it originates from goebbels or from somewhere else if that 's the important thing about it . 
  at some point during the cold war in west there was even a opposite catchphrase ` better red than dead ' meaning that it would be better to surrender to the soviet threat than risk a nuclear war . 
  both of them are oversimplifying catchphrases with black-and-white dichotomy and it 's just sad that only objection to them is a possible relation to fucking goebbels . 
  such rhetorical trick is known as poisoning the well - and as it happens that lapse of reasoning was well abused by the very goebbels you seem to dislike but for some reason choose to mimic in rhetoric . 
   he applied for social housing , but five years on , the local authorities did n't give any answer to his request . 
  why ? 
  for fucks sake how is it even possible to avoid giving any answer for * five years * ? 
  someone in there must have really really disliked him . 
  well then by all means do post pics of their own mass rallies . 
  ease of doing business in [ austria ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/austria/ ) seems that compared to 2013 austria has not improved as much as other high-income countries and has dropped by two ranks to # 30 . 
  almost all of austria 's indicators have improved a little but because other countries have improved more austria 's ranking has dropped in almost all categories and only risen in the ` trading across borders ' +2 . 
  i do n't think there 's something * wrong * with austria . 
  perhaps she just momentarily forgot the red queen 's race :  `` well , in our country , '' said alice , still panting a little , `` you 'd generally get to somewhere else -- if you run very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing . '', 
    `` a slow sort of country ! '', 
  said the queen . 
  `` now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . 
  if you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! '', 
   as a dutch person i do n't understand what motivates people to voluntarily attend pro-government ( or pro anything ) rallies . 
  looks suspicious to me , we only go to demonstrations if we 've got something to complain about . 
  have n't you had for example pro-lgbt rights rallies in the netherlands ? 
  an example of demonstrations for something , to publicly voice support for something . 
  those pro-eu demonstrators have massed a rally to show their support for aligning with the eu because moldova has not done it yet . 
  in a sense , if you like , you might see that as an act of complaining about the lack of progress on the issue . 
  or you could see it as an act to show support for the government 's aspirations - as the government also wants to and says it will continue to pursue association with the eu . 
  either way i do n't see people rallying and publicly voicing their opinion as suspicious activity . 
  considering history associating with the eu is a big , indeed historical , step for moldova and the situation may be tense and even precarious so people feel the need to publicly show their stance . 
  and i can not see anything inherently wrong in people rallying to demostrate support for something they see as important ( and tbh it really surprises me that it 's a dutch thing to see such as suspicious ) . 
  relevant : [ moldova remains committed to pro-eu policy ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-eu-ukraine-russia/25176217.html )  moldovan prime minister iurie leanca has said his country respects ukraine 's decision to suspend its preparations to sign an association agreement with the european union but that his country will continue to pursue association with the eu . 
  communists oppose :  former moldovan president vladimir voronin , head of the communist party , said on november 21 that his country should `` follow '' ukraine and suspend talks with the eu . 
  does anyone have polls , surveys or analyses of the public opinions ? 
   and pro-russian part in the south and east , that has 17 million native russian speakers even in southern and eastern regions [ 50 % support joining the eu ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ra0ht/the_big_loser_in_ukraines_rebuff_of_europe_ukraine/cdl6hie ), 
  this brookings analysis quotes three different polls : [ viktor yanukovych : losing europe ... and losing the ukrainian public ? 
  ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/11/18-viktor-yanukovych-losing-europe-ukrainian-public-pifer-thoburn ) november [ ifak ukraine poll ] ( http://www.dw.de/dw-trend-%d0%b1%d1%96%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%88%d1%96%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c-%d1%83%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%97%d0%bd%d1%86%d1%96%d0%b2-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b2%d1%81%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bf-%d0%b4%d0%be-%d1%94%d1%81/a-17230854 ) shows 58 % supports eu membership in the future : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hshglrz ) surprisingly even in the most russian regions of south and east 50 % support joining the eu . 
  october [ gfk ukraine poll ] ( http://www.gfk.ua/public_relations/press/press_articles/011218/index.ua.html ) shows three times the support for association agreement with the eu compared to russia 's customs union : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldjvevm ) [ september poll ] ( http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=rus&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=196&amp;page=1 ) by the kyiv international institute of sociology showed 41 % favoring the eu and 35 % russia 's customs union . 
  in demographic breakdown the support for the eu is biggest among the young while the old favour customs union : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/turo7c9 ), 
   at a meeting in kiev a couple of weeks ago mykola azarov , ukraine 's prime minister , told radoslaw sikorski , poland 's foreign minister , and myself that all four presidents and all 14 prime ministers of ukraine since independence supported signing an ambitious association agreement with the eu . 
   they did so because it was seen as by far the best path to the necessary modernisation of their country . 
  if the choice was between stagnation with russia or integration with the eu , we were told that ukraine had made up its mind . 
  and opinion polls showed solid and increasing support for this european choice . 
   but then kiev did a surprise u-turn , abandoning the european path and throwing ukraine into profound economic and political uncertainty . 
   why ? 
  in talks with the eu , the ukrainian leadership has been very explicit in describing the brutal economic pressure by russia they have been experiencing . 
  we have been told about trade having been cut by a quarter . 
  and threats of measures that would take ukraine straight to bankruptcy . 
   lithuania even went further and has made laws that put you in jail for denying soviet occupation or for having soviet symbols . 
  nobody acknowledges this except lithuania , so why is there such law ? 
  actually many nations and international organizations do acknowledge the soviet occupation of the baltic countries including the soviet occupation of lithuania :  the baltic states , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] the united states [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and its courts of law , [ 11 ] the european parliament , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the european court of human rights [ 15 ] and the united nations human rights council [ 16 ] have all stated that these three countries were invaded , occupied and illegally incorporated into the soviet union under provisions [ 17 ] of the 1939 molotov -- ribbentrop pact , first by the soviet union , then by nazi germany from 1941 to 1944 , and again by the soviet union from 1944 to 1991 . 
  [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] this policy of non-recognition has given rise to the principle of legal continuity , which holds that de jure , the baltic states had remained independent states under illegal occupation throughout the period from 1940 to 1991 . 
   as an example , if you did n't notice , russia was the only voice of reason on the issue of syria . 
  how so ? 
  fruit and vegetable consumption among children the category still does n't include berries . 
  which is strange as most berries have lotsa vitamins and healthy stuff , even more so than many fruits . 
   particularly the netherlands i hear they [ appreciate high pitch voices . 
   one economist warned on friday .
