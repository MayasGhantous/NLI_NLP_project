  the $ 500 bn claim was specifically about russia . 
  for ukraine 's trade with the cis see the graph in my post . 
   ukraine is in need of cash . 
  eu has promised ~ 500-800 million euros and to negotiate talks with imf to provide ukraine with further credits with less severe austerity measures than imf originally wanted . 
  which makes the pm 's comment even more strange . 
   the figure was between 100 and 500 billion dollars to `` modernize ukraine 's economy , '' to make it compatible with the eu 's market . 
  reuters reports he claimed a loss of $ 500 bn in trade with russia and additional $ 100 bn for eu standards . 
   but i would be careful in giving money to the current government of ukraine . 
  indeed . 
   if ukraine gdp is 175 billion usd how can they lose 300 billion eur ? 
  they would n't . 
  the arbitrary $ 500 bn ( or $ 300 bn ) figure does not make sense and it 's difficult to tell what it 's ment to represent - other than possibly mangled reporting . 
  in 2012 the value of ukraine 's trade with the eu was $ 37.7 bn which is about the same as trade with the cis blok at $ 38.2 bn , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3pgftlx ) in 2012 ukraine 's exports to the eu were [ about $ 14.6 bn ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_113459.pdf ) and to the russia [ about $ 13.3 bn ( $ 18 bn ) ] ( http://rt.com/business/russia-ukraine-customs-eu-319/ ) . 
  if we assume that by signing the deal with the eu all of ukraine 's exports to russia would suddenly stop to zero ( they would n't ) by the current value it would take 28 years of zero exports until the cumulative loss would reach that $ 500 bn figure . 
  yet in reality signing the deal with the eu would not mean zero exports to russia . 
  they might get hurt somewhat but exports and investements with the eu would grow . 
   that the last straw was a letter from ** imf ** as a reason that makes as little sense as the arbitrary $ 500 bn figure does . 
  the eu agreement is a separate issue from ukraine 's bilateral stand-by agreements with the imf , and the pm confusing them sounds very strange . 
   thanks for providing the link . 
  indeed , this is a second-hand account of his words and the numbers sound kind of unreal . 
  yes they do . 
  over an arbritrary time frame it may be true that if all exports to russia dropped to nil those losses would amount to $ 500 bn at * some * point in the future . 
  but in the context that number alone does not make much sense as partnership with the eu would also bring more trade and investments into ukraine . 
  edit : currently the value of ukraine 's trade with the eu ( $ 37.7 bn ) is about the same as with the cis ( $ 38.2 bn ) , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3pgftlx )  it looks like something fishy is going behind the closed doors now ... that may very well be the case . 
  do you happen to know who yanukovich 's advisors on this matter are ? 
  iirc he 's had a team or two of experts making calculations and estimates about the probable economic impacts . 
  but regarding this reported number i think it 's probably a case of poor reporting - perhaps the reuters reporters have misunderstood something or left something out , as that part does come accross a bit mangled . 
   he said it in his address to the parliament the link does n't say such . 
  i have n't seen a direct quote of him saying such . 
  it appeared as a second hand account in [ this reuters story ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/uk-ukraine-eu-idukbre9ak0sp20131121?feedtype=rss&amp;feedname=businessnews ) :  eu officials told reuters that when yanukovich met the eu 's point man on ukraine , stefan fuele , on tuesday , the ukrainian leader had said he could not agree to the deal . 
  it would , he said , cost kiev $ 500 billion in trade with russia over the coming years , while implementing demands for ukraine to adopt eu legal and other standards would cost another $ 104 billion . 
  some eu diplomats had viewed that stance as brinkmanship , an effort to secure better terms . 
  so how many years is that calculation supposed to be ? 
  and the upcoming stress tests . 
  according to european banking authority chairman andrea enria [ too many banks survived eurozone crisis ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/523084/20131118/european-banking-authority-crisis-resolution-central-bank.htm ) . 
   i 'm sure they can get the last bit out of it until it 's nearly too late . 
  we 've seen the same happen with many other species nearly going extinct . 
  indeed . 
  re : the short history of whaling industry nothing stopped the great whale species from collapsing to the point of extinction - and also the industry from collapsing on itself . 
  nothing short of a global ban . 
   ... thought that rob ford was the prime minister of canada . 
  xd and to think that just a while ago your pm harper together with barroso announced the deal on ceta which was big news . 
  to avoid further confusion you should tell him to visit us more often . 
  i presume he does n't smoke crack , right ? 
  the original article by bloomberg : [ ecb said to consider minus 0.1 percent deposit rate ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/ecb-said-to-consider-mini-deposit-rate-cut-if-more-easing-needed.html ), 
   recently an agency was opened in finland for that reason . 
  yep , the [ european chemicals agency ] ( http://echa.europa.eu/ ) started june 2007 in finland . 
  incidently the agency is run self-financed and does not cost european taxpayers anything . 
  unfortunately the same can not be said of some other agencies , such as the european food safety authority ( efsa ) located in parma , italy since 2005 thanks to berlusconi . 
  that one is known as one of the most wasteful agencies in the eu . 
  for example each meeting of the management board 's 15 members costs on average $ 92,630 or whopping $ 6,175 per member , which is almost three times that of second most expensive agency . 
  reportedly they have also had conflicts of interests with ties to biotech , food , and pesticide companies . 
  which is ironic because originally the european food safety authority was supposed to be located in finland . 
  then in 2001 for some reason berlusconi threw a hissy fit and went on to a crusade until he got that particular agency to italy . 
  all the conditions set by the european parliament were met : [ european parliament approves eu 's long-term budget ( mff ) 2014-2020 ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20131118ipr25541/html/european-parliament-approves-eu%e2%80%99s-long-term-budget - ( mff \\ ) -2014 -2020 ) here 's the [ mff 2014-20 by headings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a5xzq7c ) and on the ec 's site funding is listed interactively [ by programmes .

  you 're a bit too vabue about what you 'd like to do and see for me to recommend anything in particular . 
  so i 'll just go ahead and tell what i 'd like to do some day . 
  one day i want to travel the whole lenght of the [ danube river ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube ) from its source in the black forest in germany to its delta in sulina , romania on the shore of the black sea . 
  the river has a long very interesting history , variable geography , lots of beautiful and variable nature and landscapes , it flows in ten countries with different histories and cultures , and through some wonderful cities . 
  not sure yet how i 'd like to do it ( boat , car , canoo whatever ) but would be an interesting trip anyhow . 
  over here your electricity bill has three components : electricity , transfer and taxes . 
  you can easily get competing bids for electricity from the numerous power companies . 
  they even call you from time to time with cheaper deals , or you can use different [ web services ] ( http://www.sahkonhinta.fi/search ) to compare the prices fitting to your estimated consumption patterns and change your electricity provider accordingly . 
  for example , according to the website currently the cheapest deal for me would be all renewables electricity at 5.70 cent/kwh from power company 220 energia . 
  the deals vary according to your usage patterns and pricing scheme you choose . 
  often using pricing binded to [ nord pool spot ] ( http://www.nordpoolspot.com/ ) power market prices gives you low prices . 
  you also have to pay for the transfer to the utility running the power infrastructure . 
  unfortunately you really can not have competing bids on that as the utility has an effective monopoly in your area . 
  the transfer prices vary according to where you live roughly between 6-10 cent/kwh . 
  with all expencens combined electricity in finland is about 16-18 cent/kwh on average , but ymmv depending on consumption pattern , deal , area , etc. 
  unfortunately i do n't have links to complete assessments of germany 's current account surplus . 
  but because there are other significant contributing factors to the surplus i think any assessment which concentrates on exports only is inadequate , and such assessments and their conclusions should be approached with caution . 
  and i think it 's a good idea to conduct an inquiry as that will produce more relevant updated information . 
   the survey also shows a slight increase of traditional views , in particular in eastern and mediterranean countries . 
  asked if `` we depend too much on science and not enough on faith , '' 39 % of european respondents agree , while 32 % disagree and 25 % are neutral . 
  ( those with a lower level of education are more likely to agree with that statement . ), 
  on average , this is only a 1-point increase in the number of respondents who agreed compared with the previous survey , carried out in 2010 . 
  but this figure is on the rise in 17 out of 28 countries , including bulgaria , where 66 % of respondents agree that science takes too much precedence over faith -- a whopping 14-point increase . 
  here 's the answers to the statement * `` we depend too much on science and not enough on faith '' * on a [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9lobyoc ) i guess in addition to there being a correlation with religiousness in a country the rise since 2010 may also be attributed to people having a tendency of turning towards traditional views in times of political or economic uncertainty . 
  here 's the change from 2010 by country : [ table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fpv9yw8 ) the full report * eb79 .2 responsible research and innovation ( rri ) , science and technology * with breakdowns , maps and all is available here : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb_special_419_400_en.htm#401, 
   that 's neat , i did n't know that ; thankyou for the link . 
  yep , it 's very interesting and to some extent even makes evolutionary sense : we would n't have a foreskin unless it had useful functions . 
  i very much agree that the hiv argument is at best irrelevant to the infant circumcision to the point of being silly as 1 ) infants do not get stds by their irresponsible sexual behavior , and 2 ) hiv rates in nordic countries are very low and it 's unclear how some suspect studies conducted in africa , in areas with severe hiv epidemics , would be applicable in the nordic countries . 
  and just as expected 3 ) the campaigns to get african men circumcised has already led to rising hiv rates among them : [ botswana hiv infection among circumcised men `` rises '' ] ( http://en.starafrica.com/news/botswana-hiv-infection-among-circumcised-men-rises.html ) what 's also interesting is how the hiv argument and the assumption of the foreskin as a vector for disease relates to the medical history of circumcision . 
  circumcision has always been * `` a solution in search of a problem '' * , as edward wallerstein put it . 
  here 's a fun compilation of various scientific falsehoods used as a misinformed medical justification for circumcision through its history : http://www.icgi.org/medicalization/#page_1 from `` curing '' perfectly natural things such as wet dreams and masturbation to beliefs that it would cure paralysis , bedwetting , crossed eyes , epilepsia , deafness , tuberculosis , cancer , clubfoot , and more . 
  in 1894 an article argued that circumcising the `` negro '' would reduce the rape of white women , and in 1991 a mass circumcision was supposed to prevent sand from getting under soldiers ' foreskins . 
  they 're all claims produced by medical experts and medical science , a field in which some researchers have been very eager to mutilate infant penises for some reason - or for * any * reason for that matter . 
  and as expected it did n't take long after the discovery of hiv for these guys to claim that the universal cure of circumcision would prevent it * somehow * . 
  i 'm not sure if it was aaron j. fink in 1986 who first came up with the idea as also valiere alcena has claimed bids on that . 
  yet still after almost 30 years the actual evidence for that assumption is lacking , and even quite the opposite as that more recent research shows . 
   do they just chuck the clit in the trash when they are done ? 
  the practices of fgm vary a lot globally . 
  depending on the culture it can involve scratching , pinching or making an incision on the clitoral hood ( e.g. 
  in indonesia ) to making excisions and even removing most of the external genitalia ( e.g. 
  ` pharaotic circumcision ' in egypt/sudan ) .
