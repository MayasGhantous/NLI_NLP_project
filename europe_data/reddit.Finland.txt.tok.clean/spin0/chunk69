  italy ) as evasion , or downplaying the challenge of having the resposibility of guarding the external border . 
  meanwhile just recently in romania it [ reportedly ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/social/prim-procurorul-parchetului-gheorgheni-izabella-majeczki-retinuta-de-dna-11644286 ) takes only two cows , three sheep and two lambs to bribe a senior prosecutor . 
  how much would it take to bribe a border controller or a senior officer ? 
  and in bulgaria the vice chairman of parliament recently all but * disappeared * when it became known that there was an investigation of him and his son for alleged money-laundering . 
  personally i really would like to see romania and bulgaria in the schengen with us in the future , but i also do see the stated concerns about corruption and organized crime as legit . 
   as i 've understood it a family from lebanon has been asked to pay ~ ~ 100 camels ~ ~ 50 000 euro , an equivalent of ~ ~ 50 000 euro ~ ~ 100 camels , ftfy, 
   a ) the monetary sum is based on the value of 100 ( ? ), 
  camels . 
  in western countries the possible compensations to the victim or victim 's family can vary between countries and cases from nothing to millions and seem quite arbitrary anyway . 
  so however hard i try i just can not get riled up about the market value of camels here as to me it seems just as arbritrary as many other instances . 
  but as apparently in german justice system the victim or victim 's family is not entitled to compensation i can understand that such may feel a strange concept . 
   b ) in modern society there is no compensation that the victim could claim , just like there is no revenge or vigilantism . 
  the legal system decides as a non biased instance . 
  it might sentence the accused to pay a fine or to go to prison etc. , but the important part is that the `` victim '' plays no part the process . 
  til i do n't live in a modern society . 
  when i was randomly mugged i was indeed entitled to financial compensation by the culprit , it was me ( rather arbitrarily ) proposing the adequate compensation , and in the case i was very much part of the process . 
   humanity suffered through literally thousands of years under those conditions , until we reached the break trough of a neutral judicial system . 
  it 's vital to acknowledge the effort it took to accomplish this , in order to realize the importance of our current system and the values behind it . 
  well based on your description i for one do not want your current system . 
  i think the whole 100-camels-zomg-rhetoric misses the important point here . 
  the driver was not the culprit in the first place , and it apparently was the boy who ran against the red light . 
  and that the family demanding compensation is apparently involved in organized crime . 
  but a headline ` organized crime family demands compensation for a dead boy ' does not sound as sexy as 100 camel thingy , right ? 
   regarding this case in particular : there 's no crime involved , at all . 
  the killed boy crossed the street on a red light , there 's not even a glimpse of guilt that could befall the car driver . 
  so the felony here was the pedestrian running against red light ( if that 's what actually happened , so much confusing and contradictory information ) . 
   if it were the other way round -- the driver running a read light -- then it 'd be negligent manslaughter . 
  up to five years or fine ( measured in daily disposable income , not camels ) . 
  heh , contradictory to op 's version apparently there were no camels trading hands this time either . 
  and that did sound a bit unlikely , really . 
  would the victim 's family be entitled to compensation if it was the driver running against red light ? 
   then you have to read about people claiming camels as compensation and that 's happening in one of earth 's most advanced countries the agreed upon compensation to victim 's family is money , not camels . 
  what is the usual compensation to victim 's family `` in one of earth 's most advanced countries '' ? 
  thanks . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  seems op has misunderstood something . 
  how much is the usual compensation for victim 's family in germany ? 
   as i 've understood it a family from lebanon has been asked to pay 100 camels , an equivalent of 50 000 euro , i 'm confused . 
  is the compensation supposed to be camels or money ? 
   let 's be honest ; your immigrants are all unskilled and can not possibly contribute to your country . 
  no , rather let 's be honest and say that 's simply not true . 
  with jam . 
   i think a lot of people in sweden are very frustrated with the completely unsustainable amount of immigration to the country . 
  ...  it 's hard to find any statistics on all of this , because the `` statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n '' , a governmentally owned agency , responsible for gathering statistics on all sorts of stuff , does not make any statistics about it . 
  one of those is not like the other . 
  it is not good reasoning to first make claims that would need statistics for support , and then claim that any such statistics do not exist . 
  that 's not fact based reasoning but personal belief and bias . 
  and statistics actually do exist and have been linked to in this very discussion - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1q9mdk/nazi_march_today_in_stockholm_in_support_of/cdane1z,

   baroness ashton , a british commissioner within the ec , was never elected by a british or european electorate , and came from pretty much obscurity . 
  the way uk elects its commissioners is uk 's problem . 
  if you feel your government does it wrong then contact them and propose a better method . 
  okay , * why * do you think limiting the energy consumption of domestic vacuum cleaner motors is wrong ? 
   if a 900w device is used at the maximum power twice the time that the 1600w would be used -- there will be 0 savings in energy . 
  and you would do that because ... ? 
  you know how a vacuum cleaner works , right ? 
  and the design issues related to actual cleaning efficiency , right ? 
  so far all you have provided to support your contention are your own suppositions which for some reason happen to conveniently align with it . 
  it is symptomatic of a belief system at work , not critical thinking with factual basis . 
   but energy costs money and people have a natural incentive to purchase the most energy-efficient products . 
  there is absolutely no reason to ban vcs that you do n't like . 
  are you sure ? 
  do you have actual research based evidence to support that ? 
   i do n't tell you what cellphones to use ( and i consider modern smartphones rather too overbloated ) and you do n't tell me what vc i am allowed to buy . 
  actually the * are * regulations for cellphones too . 
  the earlier thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1pr1sy/the_gourmands_of_brussels_the_eu_is_on_the_verge/, 
   it was actually raised in the q&a that ... 
  so what ? 
  pretty much anything can be `` raised '' in a q&a session . 
  i 've seen a q&a session where it was actually raised that the politicians in question are alien lizards . 
  yet at least my conclusion from that was not that they actually were alien lizards - but of course ymmv . 
  and besides , it 's not even those persons but the actual * campaign * we 're talking about . 
  and raising awareness of the upcoming election and encouraging people to use their vote is not `` pro-federalist '' campaign . 
  heh , i had to make similar calculations earlier this day before putting that 31 twh into my comments , but indeed the estimate checks out . 
  what if they will ? 
  i do believe that a 900 w device consumes less energy than a 1600 w device . 
  talking about stupidity i think it takes a special kind of being willingly stupid * not * to see the savings potential when it undeniably exists . 
  yep , the income taxes in finland are not that high as is often believed . 
  though the income taxes do not include other taxes such as vat etc. 
  the long term trend has been lowering the income taxation . 
  this article has a graph of the average income tax percentages and the trends in different groups : http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_income_gap_creeps_wider/6914012, 
  nimi - * name * syntynyt - * year of birth * ansiotulot - * earnings income * p\u00e4\u00e4omatulot - * capital income * yhteens\u00e4 - * total * vero - % - * tax % * maakunta - * province *, 
  ah , i misunderstood you , my bad . 
  and indeed you 're correct about that . 
   i use my vacuum 2 hours a month . 
  i do n't see the savings here . 
  the electricity consumption of domestic vacuum cleaners in the eu has been estimated as about 31 twh in a year , or roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of hungary . 
  [ the 2005 estimate ] ( http://www.eceee.org/ecodesign/products/vacuum_cleaners/wd_cf25june2010 ) is likely bigger now . 
   imho the ban is stupid . 
  has the potential of quite big savings in energy and greenhouse gases . 
  more efficient domestic vacuum cleaners could save as much as 10-20 twh of electricity annually in the eu - equivalent to the electricity consumption of croatia or the residential electricity consumption of belgium . 
   you are not allowed to buy 5000w vacuum cleaners . 
  i 'm sure one is able to buy , lease or rent such industrial vacuum cleaners if the need arises . 
  the regulation concerns domestic products and does not apply to wet , wet and dry , battery operated , robot , industrial , or central vacuum cleaners , floor polishers , outdoor vacuums . 
   this is a valid domain of action , since individual buyers generally think their individual actions are just a drop in the bucket and therefore make their choice according to parameters like their own comfort and budget . 
  and it 's a quite big bucket too .
