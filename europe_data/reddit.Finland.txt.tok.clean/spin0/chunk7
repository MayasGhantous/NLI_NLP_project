  yes , the gripen certainly has a lot going for it . 
  we 'll see in few years how the jas 39e/f turns out and at what unit cost . 
  and also the f-35a has n't entered service yet . 
  both f-35a and jas 39e/f are designed with ease of maintenance in mind ( modularity , ease of access ) albeit the stealth capabilities bring some additional steps into procedures ( e.g. 
  maintaining coating , rcs testing ) . 
  and none of that supports your claim `` the f-35 has shown to be an expensive high maintenance failure . '', 
  you even point out yourself that * the f-35a has not even entered service yet * . 
  hence you do n't know if the f-35a is a failure or not for its intended roles , nor do you know how ` high ' the maintenance will be . 
  but certainly , the development has taken longer and has also cost a lot more than initially projected . 
  but in fighter development both schedule and cost overruns are more of a rule than exception , and if that was held as a criteria for a failure then by far most fighters in the world would be ` failures ' - including the jas gripen . 
  and while i do think it 's fair for the us taxpayers to critisise the f-35 program for the cost overruns and delays , i do n't think those render the f-35a a ` failure ' as a fighter in its intended roles . 
   it has already cost over $ 167 billion no , it certainly has n't . 
  you 're probably confusing the earlier estimates of cost overrun of the development and procurement program with development costs . 
  you see , besides development work the program cost includes the purchase of over 2,400 fighters . 
  in 2001 the development and procurement program was estimated as about $ 306 billion which has been overrun ( at some point by estimated $ 167 bn ) . 
  the current estimate for the development and procurement of 2,443 us aircraft is $ 398.6 billion : [ f-35 engine cost up , sustainment down ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140417/defreg02/304170026/f-35-engine-cost-up-sustainment-down ) tl ; dr you can not claim fighter a ` failure ' on schedule and cost overruns of the development program alone . 
  and your claimed development costs are wrong . 
  heh , for some reason i always read it as such . 
   they should go for the su-35 why ? 
  it 's not even on the list of candidates . 
  however , the [ sukhoi pak fa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_pak_fa ) is . 
   the f-35 has shown to be an expensive high maintenance failure . 
  really ? 
  the f-35a that will enter usaf service only in dec 2016 ? 
  already a failure ? 
  i think the arm chair generals are stretching it . 
  most often they tend to refer to the estimated total us program cost of about $ 1 trillion , but fail to remember that it 's projected for over 55 years , not to mention the differences between the a , b and c variants . 
  if the f-35a was such a failure i do n't think countries outside the us would be lining up to purchase it but they are : australia , italy , netherlands , norway and turkey have already ordered f-35as , and canada , israel , japan and south-korea are planning to . 
  the procurement is only at its early planning stages . 
  the plan is to make the decision in early 2020s , to acquire the new planes around 2025-2030 , and to have them in operative use through 2040s . 
  the initial five named candidates are : f-35a lightning ii ( perhaps with the drag chute as in norway ? ), 
  jas 39e/f gripen ( aka ng ) dassault rafale suhoi pak fa mig-35 ( plus possible dark horse candidates ) imo the strongest candidate is f-35a , albeit the new gripen will likely be very good too . 
  rafale will get old sooner than f-35 . 
  basically the faf prefers to have all weather multirole fighter that can operate like this : http://youtu.be/bnuvcvigkxe?t=1m38s, 
  man , you are a prophet !, 
  yep , should be f-35 lightning ii . 
   did you actually read about what happened ? 
  because that has absolutely nothing to do with it . 
  it actually has very much to do with it . 
  the very reason why this particular group was so weak was only few other nationalist/eurosceptic parties were willing to join it ( remember the discord between them after the election ? ) . 
  hence the group was fragile to begin with , and now merely one mep leaving it caused the group to dissolve . 
  additionally , this :  the efdd said in a statement that ms grigule had been asked to resign from the group by martin schulz , chair of the european parliament , in order to become president of a delegation to kazakhstan . 
  do you take everything efdd or mr farage says at face value ? 
  i do n't , and hence i 'm willing to wait for further relevant statements from others and especially from ms grigule .

  the shortcomings of that graph are the same as the last time it was posted : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i7cri/eu_dependence_on_russian_natural_gas/, 
  originally the post did not have that tag . 
  and i see nothing warrantig it . 
  then apparently someone complained ` because of the topless woman ' . 
  now the post has a nsfw tag . 
  because think of the children , and ` for all we know there might me some eight-year old on this subreddit ' ( who apparently has never seen a tit before ) . 
  the mere possibility of someone seeing something natural is simply horrible .

   getting so upset over indisputable historical facts is childish . 
  `` indisputable '' ? 
  you wrote :  it was actually the tsarist russian empire ( alexander i ) that united and created finland as a country ( grand douchy ) allowing it broad autonomy and making all this cultural renaissance possible . 
  first , the tsarist russian empire nor alexander i neither united nor created finland as a country . 
   allowing it broad autonomy secondly , the autonomy was allowed out of necessity , not because of benevolence . 
  the russian empire had invaded and occupied finland in 1809 and knew how prone they would be to revolt , and after the russian invasion finland became a part of the russian empire with the status of an autonomous grand duchy . 
  it is true that especially the grand duke of finland alexander ii 's reforms brought lot of foreign ( esp . 
  western ) investment into finland . 
  many things finally progressed during his rule , and we loved him for that , but i do n't see why that progress would not have happened sooner or more rapidly without his rule . 
  and still that autonomous status did n't stop the russians from attempting forced russification by cutting that autonomy when they saw fit . 
   and making all this cultural renaissance possible . 
  thirdly , those painters studied and got their influences from western europe and finland , not russia .
