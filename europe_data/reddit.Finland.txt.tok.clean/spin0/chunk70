  the electricity consumption of domestic vacuum cleaners in the eu has been estimated as about ** 31 twh ** in a year ( 2005 , [ source ] ( http://www.eceee.org/ecodesign/products/vacuum_cleaners/wd_cf25june2010 ) ) , or roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of hungary . 
  that estimate is from 2005 and is likely bigger now . 
  having more efficient vacuum cleaners has a huge potential for savings in energy and also greenhouse gases . 
   in addition , i have better things to do on a saturday than to research the comparative merits of vacuum cleaners . 
  indeed . 
  and that 's why it 's a very good idea to provide the relevant information of product 's energy efficiency , average annual energy consumption , dust re-emission , and cleaning performance in an easy-to-read form such as the [ eu energy label for vacuum cleaners ] ( http://www.bureauveritas.com/wps/wcm/connect/bv_com/group/home/about-us/our-business/our-business-consumer-products/news+and+events/regulatory+bulletins/eu_energy_label_vacuum_cleaners ) . 
   i am very much in doubt that people want to purchase wasteful guzzlers instead of efficient modern cleaning devices ( especially if you take into account insanely high electricity prices in some eu countries ) . 
  and that 's why it 's a good idea to provide the consumers the relevant information about product 's energy efficiency , average annual energy consumption , dust re-emission , and cleaning performance in an easy-to-read form such as the [ eu energy label for vacuum cleaners ] ( http://www.bureauveritas.com/wps/wcm/connect/bv_com/group/home/about-us/our-business/our-business-consumer-products/news+and+events/regulatory+bulletins/eu_energy_label_vacuum_cleaners ) . 
   this regulation is redundant , it is not necessary and it is stupid from any point of view . 
  now you 're contradicting your previous point . 
  to make informed choices the consumers do need such information and providing it is not redundant , unnecessary or stupid `` from any point of view '' . 
   the eu should stay the fuck out of legislation like this and leave it to the individual countries ? 
  ce markings and energy labels concern the whole common market - that 's the point of having them . 
   so how will i know what device i need to get to do harder jobs than a little dust in a living room ? 
  the [ regulation ( eu ) no 665/2013 ] ( http://www.bureauveritas.com/wps/wcm/connect/bv_com/group/home/about-us/our-business/our-business-consumer-products/news+and+events/regulatory+bulletins/eu_energy_label_vacuum_cleaners ) does not apply to wet , wet and dry , battery operated , robot , industrial , or central vacuum cleaners , floor polishers , outdoor vacuums . 
   besides the eu commission funding the pro-federalist act.impact.react campaign til campaign to rise awareness of the upcoming election and encouraging people to use their vote is `` pro-federalist '' .

   nah , chinese have ban for even visiting nasa since this year . 
  yep , as exampled in the link i provided . 
  the * other * ridiculous policy i mentioned dates back to 2011 when a clause in the us federal budget prohibited nasa from any joint scientific activity with china . 
   besides , qian xuesen was deported from usa and imprisoned in china on suspicion of being foreign agent for good measure . 
  aaand after that he became the father of chinese rocketry . 
  how do you feel about the closer ties between esa and the eu ? 
  will esa become an eu agency ? 
   it probably has to do with china hacking things . 
  it has lot more to do with the stupidity of certain us politicians . 
  [ frank wolf ( politician ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_wolf_ ( politician \\ ) ) :  in the 2011 united states federal budget , wolf inserted a clause prohibiting nasa and the white house office of science and technology policy from ** any ** joint scientific activity with china for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year . 
  wolf remarked , * `` we do n't want to give them the opportunity to take advantage of our technology , and we have nothing to gain from dealing with them . 
  and frankly , it boils down to a moral issue . 
  ... would you have a bilateral program with stalin ? 
  '' * [ 20 ] this prohibition resulted in chinese journalists being denied access to the launching of space shuttle endeavour on the mission sts-134 , that was carrying the alpha magnetic spectrometer which was ** built ** in part by chinese scientists . 
  [ 21 ] wolf 's policies and bans have already led to us scientists boycotting a scientific nasa conference in protest : [ us scientists boycott nasa conference over china ban ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/05/us-scientists-boycott-nasa-china-ban ), 
   nasa notoriously does n't allow any chinese involvement . 
  yep , but do n't blame nasa , blame politicians and especially frank wolf . 
  the nasa leadership , nasa scientists , and even obama would want to do more open cooperation also with china . 
  but the congress , especially republicans and nasa committee chairman frank wolf are heavily opposed to such and have led the congress to broadly ban nasa from doing ** any ** cooperation with the chinese state , any chinese company , and also prohibited hosting chinese visitors . 
  which is ridiculous , hurts the science and has led to silly situations . 
  for example nasa scientists can not participate to relevant meetings with chinese engineers and researchers . 
  so sometimes when the chinese enter the nasa guys have to leave , so the chinese scientists are left to discuss rocketry and space science only with people from esa , roscosmos etc. 
  the idiotic situation has even resulted frustrated us scientists to boycott a nasa conference about exoplanets : [ us scientists boycott nasa conference over china ban ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/05/us-scientists-boycott-nasa-china-ban ) edit : here 's an interesting tidbit about the history of rocketry in the us : [ qian xuesen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qian_xuesen ) ( 1911 -- 2009 ) was a scientist who made important contributions to the missile and space programs of both the united states and people 's republic of china . 
  in fact in the us he was one of the founders of the jet propulsion laboratory . 
  but later he was deported because mccarthy era red scare policies . 
  which was a smart thing for the us to do , because he then became the father of chinese rocketry . 
   space is awesome , so i 'm all for working together !,

  the esa convention does not have restrictions that only european states could participate . 
  canada is an associate member with over 30 years of close cooperation with esa . 
  and also other countries have cooperation agreements such as israel , turkey , and ukraine . 
  esa also has office in moscow : [ esa permanent mission in the russian federation ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/esa_permanent_mission_in_russia/about_esa_moscow ) . 
  the office was established in 1995 and enjoys a diplomatic status . 
  and ukraine 's ssau has also a cooperation agreement with esa , does close co-operation in projects , and is aiming for further integration : [ a cooperation agreement between the government of ukraine and the european space agency was signed in paris ] ( http://www.nkau.gov.ua/nsau/newsnsau.nsf/hronole/54f1c600559e994cc22573db00489ee7?opendocument&amp;amp;lang=e ), 
   they have some offices in brussels , i believe . 
  yes , in belgium esa has the [ brussels office ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/brussels_office ) . 
  and also the [ redu centre ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/redu_centre ) , which is a satellite tracking and testing facility in ardennes . 
  the esa convention does not have restrictions that only european states could participate , but the esa council does implement such principle for full membership status . 
  that 's why canada has a status of [ associate member ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_european_space_agency#associate_members ) despite its integration with the esa institutions and close co-operation in projects . 
  i do n't know the numbers of engineers specific to the launchers , but generally by far most of the esa personnel are from germany , france and italy . 
  which makes sense as those three countries have also biggest aerospace industries . 
  thank you for your input and i do see your pov on the value of human spaceflight . 
  it is a heavily debated issue , perhaps beoynd the thread , and on this issue i 'm in the robotic research camp as i think robotic exploring produces more science results per $ invested . 
  that is not to say i 'm against all human spaceflight in principle . 
  i do see * some * value in gaining and maintaining abilities to survive and work in space . 
  sadly , space stations are extremely expensive and take funding away from other fields of research and science projects . 
  but in esa it 's not too bad : human spaceflight takes only about 10 % of esa budget , and as members can opt out - and my country does - there 's no reason to complain . 
  estonia is a [ european cooperating state ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/european_cooperating_states ) .

  all member countries contribute to the mandatory programmes on a scale based on their gdp .
