  the optional programmes are of interest to some members who are free to decide on their level of involvement . 
  for example finland ( and many other members ) does not participate into the optional human spaceflight program . 
  therefore we wo n't see a finnish astronaut orbiting earth on the iss , but then again i do n't think it would be worth the expence and the money can be put on other science . 
  i for one would opposed of wasting science funding on people buzzing about in the orbit . 
  the ** mandatory ** programmes are : future studies , technological research , education , common investments ( facilities , laboratories , infrastructure ) , solar system science , astronomy and fundamental physics . 
  the ** optional ** programmes are : human spaceflight , telecommunications & integrated applications , earth observation , launchers , navigation , robotic exploration and space situational awareness different countries participate to different programs so also differences in total contributions are to be expected . 
  yep . 
  he was called rosvo-rudolf in the finnish language version . 
  ** '70s ** kid here . 
  * games in school polttopallo , the finnish version of baseball , football * breakfast puolukkapuuro was also my fav but corn flakes or weetabix were okay .

  * fav summer toys : toy aeroplanes , nothing compares to a [ sleek streek ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tvyfjkd ) also electric toy boats and for some reason especially [ this stupid submarine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nhuiene ) those subs were not available in finland but every time we visited sweden it was a must to get at least one to have wolfpack fun for days or weeks until the boat failed to resurface or seawater ruined its electronics . 
  but was fun while it lasted . 
  * sweets : the original [ merirosvoraha ] ( http://i.imgur.com/he8sp9j ) * school uniforms/rules : no uniforms over here .

  and who could forget the [ proffessor dr\u00f6vels hemlighet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci0h_jaxoxa ) with its absurd humour !, 
  we will rebuild . 
  in lev\u00e4luhta the men were probably buried by burning which was typical contemporary burial practice in the area , and there is at least one such burial site nearby . 
  it 's a mystery why in lev\u00e4luhta those women had such a different burial . 
  and we do n't actually even know if those people were finno-ugric or who they were , how the practice came to be , and why it stopped . 
  you might find more info in scientific publications such as * fennoscandia archaeologica * , and there 's also a 2010 documentary * [ lev\u00e4nluhdan kadonnut kansa ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1783332/ ) * ( the lost people of lev\u00e4nluhta ) which may be possible to find in swedish too . 
   why do n't you have any bog bodies ? 
  or do you have them and i just have n't heard about them ? 
  i do believe well preserved bodies might exist in some of the bogs , they just have n't been found yet . 
  the bogs do preserve organic material well and we know they have a lot of artifacts such as the [ 10400 year old fishing net ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/antrean_verkko ) and lot of other stuff such as skis , boats , tools , fishing equipment , remains of housing etc. 
  for example in [ yli-ii site ] ( http://www.kierikki.fi/sivu/fi/kierikkikeskus/arkeologiset_kohteet/ ) there 's so much stone-age fishing equipment and stuff that it 's impossible to collect it all . 
  the primary problem is of course funding , and very little has been done to systematically map or evaluate the bogs and peatlands for their potential as archaeological sites , which is a shame and needs more attention . 
  almost all of the findings have happened by accident , and because the objects are so well preserved people often do n't realize how old the artefact they stumbled upon actually is . 
  there has been some human findings in finland too , albeit so far not as well preserved as for example the tollund man or bocksten man . 
  one of the most intriguing findings so far are the mysterious bones in [ the lev\u00e4nluhta spring ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/lev%c3%a4luhta ) . 
  already in 1674 the local vicar reported that human bones are rising from the local spring . 
  in later excavations the findings have been bones of about 100 individuals ( by far most of them women ) , animal bones , carved birch poles , burnt clay and coal , and other artifacts such as jewelry , buckles and a roman bronze pot . 
  the lev\u00e4nluhta spring has been used as a burial site for several hundred years roughly between 300-700 . 
  the water has been very rich in iron , which has colored the bones red . 
  the spring itself may have been quite a sight in those days as iron rising deep from the soil would have colored it black and red . 
  the people in the area seem to have been quite well off with trade connections and all , and in the area the typical contemporary burial was done by burning . 
  so who are these people and why are they buried in a spring ? 
  why women ? 
  why children ? 
  where are the men ? 
  why there 's no remains of clothing ? 
  why no weapons or knives which were typical part of women 's costumes ? 
  why the jewelry and valuables ? 
  why did they start the practice and why did it stop ? 
  many theories have been proposed . 
  are they some sort of ritual offerings ? 
  that would be exceptional in the area , and their remains show no evidence of violence . 
  burial in water is very rare in archaelogical findings in europe and the world , which makes lev\u00e4luhta site pretty unique . 
  it 's still a big mystery . 
  the table has no category for swamps , bogs or peatlands . 
  i guess they may have been incorporated into ` other wooded land ' and ` wetland ' . 
  in finland about 26-29 % of land area or roughly 90-100\u00a0000 km ^ 2 is peatlands , bogs and such . 
  almost one-third of the eu peatland is in finland , and it 's the 6th largest area in the world . 
   female `` circumcision '' is female genital mutilation . 
  see wikipedia , see the un on it . 
  yes , i 've read on the matter quite extensively using primary sources and i am aware that by who female circumcision is called female genital mutilation . 
  what you do n't seem to be aware of is : even non-invasive or purely symbolic forms of female circumcision are defined as female genital * mutilation * even when there 's no permanent injury to genital tissue at all . 
  for example , would you call a ritual where someone is touched with an herb , or pinched , or scraped with a wooden stick without causing any permanent injury a mutilation ? 
  who does , which is the source for a lot of confusion about what fgm is , what it causes , and how prevalent it is worldwide . 
  many seem to mistakenly think that all fgm = pharaotic circumcision which is drastic yet actually one of the least prevalent forms of it . 
  you claim that female circumcision leads to `` no feelings anymore , just pain . 
  forever . '', 
  which is incorrect . 
  fgm varies from symbolic to some very invasive operations with removal of healthy tissue . 
  but even the horiffic ` pharaotic ' circumcision does not lead to total loss of all feelings or sexual stimulus and such women self-report that they can experience orgasms during intercourse . 
  some forms of fgm ** do lessen ** the sexual stimulus . 
  for example removing the external part of the clitoris indeed does that , yet because the clitoris is quite large and mostly * internal * organ ( see the [ actual anatomy of clitoris ] ( http://blog.museumofsex.com/the-internal-clitoris/ ) ) it does not lead to ` no feelings anymore ' or total loss of sexual stimulus . 
  and in fact such operation can even be corrected with plastic surgery because the clitoris is such large organ . 
  some forms of fgm ** have no effect ** on sexual stimulus at all , because they cause no permanent alteration or injury to the genital tissue and no tissue is removed . 
  and some forms of fgm ** do enhance ** the sexual stimulus . 
  for example making an incision or an excision on the clitoral hood makes the tip of the erect clitoris to protrude more outside during arousal and therefore more exposed for sexual stimulus . 
  this is one of the most prevalent forms of fgm for example in indonesia among with some of the non-injuring forms of fgm ( for further sources see my [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nqqmn/israel_attacks_council_of_europe_move_to_restrict/cclk3ng ) ) . 
  that is also the reason why this form of fgm is gaining popularity even among western women ( see [ hoodectomy ] ( http://www.clitoralunhooding.com/faq-drbenson.html ) ) . 
  women often choose do have it done with another quite popular form of fgm : labiaplasty , where parts of the labia is removed and which is [ the third most popular procedure in the uk ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2395641/british-women-hanker-designer-vaginas-labiaplasty-sees-109-cent-rise-sought-cosmetic-surgery.html ) . 
  it 's important to note that the popular fgm done to western women are done to persons who have consented and have the ability to consent to such procedures . 
  if people want to modify or mutilate their genitals they can do it be it for health , sexual , esthetic , cultural or even religious reasons . 
  and when such is done to a consenting person i see no human rights problem with it . 
  a human rights issue arises when healthy tissue is removed without a medical reason ( treatment ) from a person who * does not or even can not consent * e.g. 
  children , infants . 
  that does break the relevant human rights conventions in europe . 
  such as : the un convention of the rights of the child , articles 12 , and 24 ( 3 ) which say that children should have the right to express their own views and must be protected from traditional rituals that may be harmful to their health . 
  the council of europe 's convention on human rights and biomedicine which bans removing living tissue from a person who can not consent : `` no organ or tissue removal may be carried out on a person who does not have the capacity to consent under article 5 . '', 
  that applies also to boys . 
  boys are not excluded from the human rights . 
  the same conventions protect their right to their bodily integrity just as well as girls . 
  children 's right to physical integrity , and consent and the ability to consent are at the heart of the issue . 
  op is about the european council 's resolution which says : * `` the parliamentary assembly is particularly worried about a category of violation of the physical integrity of children , which supporters of the procedures tend to present as beneficial to the children themselves despite clear evidence to the contrary . 
  this includes , amongst others , female genital mutilation , the circumcision of young boys for religious reasons , early childhood medical interventions in the case of intersexual children and the submission to or coercion of children into piercings , tattoos or plastic surgery . 
  '' * ( resolution available here : [ children 's right to physical integrity ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/511200/20131003/male-circumcision-muslim-jewish-condemned-european-council.htm ) ) and then this :  male circumcision : everything keeps on working fine . 
  except when does n't . 
  we do know that male circumcision does have inherent risks of complications even when done in clinical settings .
