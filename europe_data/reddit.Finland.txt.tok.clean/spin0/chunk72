  circumcision-related mortality rates are not known with certainty ; this study estimates the scale of this problem . 
  this study finds that * ** approximately 117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths ( 9.01 / 100,000 ) occur annually in the united states , about 1.3 % of male neonatal deaths from all causes . 
  ** * because infant circumcision is elective , all of these deaths are avoidable .

  no wait . . you mean a * fictional * superhero ? 
   male circumcision : everything keeps on working fine . 
  female circumcision : no feelings anymore , just pain . 
  forever . 
  that is incorrect . 
   honestly , this aspect of the whole `` animal rights '' thing does n't really elicit any great sympathy from me . 
  honestly , your lack of sympathy towards pain and suffering caused to animals is irrelevant . 
  your misinformed claim was that animal welfare laws are about ` indirect expulsion ' which they are not . 
   whether or not we bonk them on the head before slitting their throat seems to me to be a pointless argument . 
  if it is pointless whether animals are ` bonked ' or not then why not ` bonk ' them ? 
  and if it is pointless why you even argued that ` bonking ' the animals would mean some sort of ` indirect expulsion ' ? 
  over here we do ` bonk ' to avoid causing undue stress , pain and suffering to animals . 
  and over here person 's religious beliefs are not a legal reason to cause undue pain or suffering to animals . 
  that table leaves out countries such as malaysia and indonesia , and does not provide worldwide prevalence of different types of fgm . 
  in indonesia alone fgm concerns almost 2 million infant girls annually . 
  by far most of the fgm 's performed are type iv such as rubbing , scraping or pinching clitoral hood with an instrument or making an incision on clitoral hood . 
  only small part of the fgm 's performed are type i where part of clitoris or clitoral hood are cut away . 
  and yes , even symbolic rituals with no permanent injury to the genital tissues are indeed categorized as female genital mutilation . 
  but there has been a worrying trend in the * medicalization * of fgm in indonesia : traditional healers/midwives have preferred more of a symbolic types of fgm ( type iv ) but medical personnel tend to perform more incisions and even excisions ( type i ) with their instruments . 
  local islamic clerics ' position on the issue is : [ cleric : do n't cut too much female genital to avoid sexuality loss ] ( http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/26/cleric-don%e2%80%99t-cut-too-much-female-genital-avoid-sexuality-loss.html ) relevant research report : [ female circumcision in indonesia - extent , implications and possible interventions to uphold women 's health rights ] ( http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/frontiers/reports/indonesia_fgm.pdf ), 
   jews have been expelled from countries many times throughout history , sometimes explicitly ( `` jews are no longer allowed in england '' ) and sometimes indirectly ( `` kosher slaughter is no longer allowed in the rhineland '' ) . 
  this would merely the latest in a long line of indirect expulsions . 
  laws banning methods of slaughter that cause undue stress , pain and suffering to animals are not about ` expulsion ' of anyone . 
  they 're about animal welfare . 
  for example , in finland and denmark the animal welfare laws say that the animal must be stunned before blooding to avoid causing such undue stress , pain and suffering to the animal . 
  person 's religious beliefs are not a legal reason to cause undue pain or suffering to animals . 
  for example a devil worshipper can freely believe in a dark fairy but an act of torturing animals to death is illegal even if it was done as a ritual belonging to that religion . 
  for example in indonesia and malaysia the most prevalent forms of fgm are scraping or scratching the clitoral hood with an instrument , or making an incision on the clitoral hood without removing anything . 
   the form where the clitoris is removed is much more severe ( let alone sewing up the vagina , or whichever other horrors ) those are the least prevalent forms of fgm . 
  removing the foreskin is the most prevalent form of mgm and it 's worse than the most prevalent forms of fgm : scratching or making an incision on the clitoral hood . 
  it already is : western women do get surgical trims to their genitals which are comparable to the prevalent form of fgm : making an incision on the clitoral hood , as it enhances sexual stimulus . 
  trimming the labia for estethic reasons has also gained popularity . 
  arguably one can do without actual hard walls if necessary .

   in general does n't mean never unfortunately , and it would only be a matter of time before someone gets killed . 
  assuming a very long time scale as it is a very rare occurence . 
  in finland the last time a wolf ( allegely ) killed a person happened in 1881 . 
  similar unfortunate effect happens in some areas of countryside in sw finland . 
  an otherwise dark area in the countryside well outside city lights is filled with orange flood from the greenhouses . 
  imagine if the greenhouses had some kind of semitransparent glazing : in the daytime it would let the sunshine in , and in the nighttime it would reflect the artificial light back inside . 
  the lights would need less power , consume less energy , and you 'd also have less light pollution . 
   during almost all of the dark season , the ground is covered by snow , which brightens up the sky . 
  right , the map does not account for the effects of snow . 
  the researchers say they plan to have it included in their future maps . 
  appears to be a matter of definitions . 
  the numbers by that lecture account only for * solid * particulate matter as aerosols , but when one discusses scattering of starlight in the visible spectrum by aerosols in the atmosphere that also includes the effects of mist , haze and water . 
  the amount of water in the atmosphere is higher on an ocean than a desert , therefore causing more scattering of starlight in the visible spectrum , and thusly contributing to the visual brightess of the night sky background . 
  and around the falkland islands .
