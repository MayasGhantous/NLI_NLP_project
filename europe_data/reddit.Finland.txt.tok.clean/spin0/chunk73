  the squid boats use huge lights visible in the [ global map ] ( http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/download/mondo_ridotto0p25.gif ), 
  night sky brightness is indeed very closely correlated with number of stars visible . 
  and judging the paper by it 's title alone is not valid critisism as it 's the content of the paper that is of interest . 
  if you read bit further to the abstract you 'll see what the paper is about :  we apply the sky brightness modelling technique introduced and developed by roy garstang to high-resolution satellite measurements of upward artificial light flux carried out with the us air force defense meteorological satellite program operational linescan system and to gtopo30 ( a global digital elevation model by the us geological survey 's eros data centre ) digital elevation data in order to predict the brightness distribution of the night sky at a given site in the primary astronomical photometric bands for a range of atmospheric aerosol contents . 
  this method , based on global data and accounting for elevation , earth curvature and mountain screening , allows the evaluation of sky glow conditions over the entire sky for any site in the world , to evaluate its evolution , to disentangle the contribution of individual sources in the surrounding territory and to identify the main contributing sources . 
  ** sky brightness , naked eye stellar visibility and telescope limiting magnitude are produced as three-dimensional arrays , the axes of which are the position on the sky and the atmospheric clarity . 
  we compare our results with available measurements . 
  ** the site has numerous papers about the subject , and also numerous maps reflecting different variables : the world atlas of sea level artificial night sky brightness maps of the artificial night sky brightness maps of the total night sky brightness maps of the naked eye stellar visibility maps of the number of visible stars maps of the growth of light pollution maps of the night sky in selected sites if interested you could also read this other relevant paper : ** naked eye star visibility and limiting magnitude mapped from dmsp-ols satellite data **  we extend the method introduced by cinzano et al. 
  ( 2000a ) to map the artificial sky brightness in large territories from dmsp satellite data , in order to map the naked eye star visibility and telescopic limiting magnitudes . 
  for these purposes we take into account the altitude of each land area from gtopo30 world elevation data , the natural sky brightness in the chosen sky direction , based on garstang modelling , the eye capability with naked eye or a telescope , based on the schaefer ( 1990 ) and garstang ( 2000b ) approach , and the stellar extinction in the visual photometric band . 
  for near zenith sky directions we also take into account screening by terrain elevation . 
  maps of naked eye star visibility and telescopic limiting magnitudes are useful to quantify the capability of the population to perceive our universe , to evaluate the future evolution , to make cross correlations with statistical parameters and to recognize areas where astronomical observations or popularisation can still acceptably be made . 
  we present , as an application , maps of naked eye star visibility and total sky brightness in v band in europe at the zenith with a resolution of approximately 1 km . 
  now , that is not to say their method is totally accurate , they even point out possible sources of inaccuracies themselves ( e.g. 
  zenith vs. horizon ) . 
  but even if there is place for valid critisism your first assessment does not do justice to their methods at all . 
  the maps are far from ` sham ' . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can not as the resolution and sensitivity of naked human eye is not enough to discern individual stars in the band of the milky way as it is seen in the night sky . 
  that 's why it was only in 1610 when the milky way was first resolved as a band of stars by galileo galilei with his telescope . 
   why are there less stars visible on the oceans , than in remote land-based locations ? 
  the ocean is pretty dark . 
  because : 1 . 
  at sea level there 's more atmosphere above you compared to mountaineus regions : more atmosphere -  more starlight scattering and extinction 2 . 
  over the ocean the atmosphere has more aerosols compared to dry regions : more aerosols -  more starlight scattering, 
  [ the method for computing ] ( http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/dmsp/index.html ) these maps is very sane . 
  it works like this basically :  we measure the upward light flux of sources on the earth surface based on dmsp satellite data and then we compute the effects on the night sky modelling the light propagation in the atmosphere . 
  depending on the kind of map , we account for many details like the scattering of light by molecules and aerosols , the extinction along light paths , the atmospheric aerosol content , the earth curvature , the altitude of each area , the mountain screening , the observed sky direction , the natural sky brightness , the stellar extinction , the eye capability . 
  one parameter not accounted for in the calculation is the increase of the stellar extinction with the zenith distance , i.e. 
  the extinction of starlight is greater near the horizon than in the zenith . 
  for further info about their methods see their scientific publications page : http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/cinzano/papers.html, 
   to me the orange light of street lights is somehow really comforting then you 'll likely find this colour rendition very comforting : [ sodium light map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zuw19pr ) here 's the [ source with a zoomable map ] ( http://www.avex-asso.org/dossiers/pl/europe/c/c/ ) . 
  interesting thing about the sodium light we use is that it shines like a beacon to the space , and a hypotethical alien civilization could use it to spot us by measuring the diurnal spectrum of earth . 
  there 's no apparent natural cause for a planet 's night side to shine in glowing sodium spectrum . 
  population density does correlate with light pollution to an extent , but it does not explain all the features in the light pollution map . 
  see for example the areas in the middle of north sea , where there 's very little population but lot of light pollution due to oil industry . 
  one could also look at the [ world map ] ( http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/download/mondo_ridotto0p25.gif ) , where there 's very little light pollution from china with high population density but a lot around the falkland islands with very little population . 
  it 's basically a map of how light is used , not a population density map . 
  it 's not either or . 
  one can have better and more efficient city lightning with less light pollution . 
  city and street lights contribute to the light pollution because of their design . 
  when the lights flood their energy all around it creates a cycle : 1 ) some of the light leaks to the sky as light pollution , 2 ) you need to use more powerful light sources to have bright enough light where it 's needed , 3 ) more powerful light sources contribute more to the light pollution . 
  by designing city and street lights which project their energy to where it 's actually needed you 'll get better city lightning , save energy , and create less light pollution ( of course it does not remove all of it , but lessens it ) . 
  in the first link there 's interesting self reflection about media 's contribution to the rise of the golden dawn : not being investigative enough and even broadcasting gd 's own propaganda material without questioning . 
   it will be interesting to see how the world 's developed economies deal with this in the future . 
  most likely with japan having to figure it out first . 
  japan has a problem with its low fertility rates , declining population and caring for the aging population , and it will only become worse in the future . 
  currently almost a quarter of the population is over 65 years old and their share is rising while the population is declining . 
  even now already the healthcare system is strained for the lack of personnel such as nurses . 
  so far japan 's solution seems to be to try and develop robots to work as nurses and companions to the elderly . 
  one reason for that is their immigration policy which is quite xenophobic . 
  rather than having for example foreign nurses immigrating to japan they would have robots to care for the old . 
  see for example this article : [ no , robot : japan 's elderly fail to welcome their robot overlords ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12347219 ),

   the enigmatic structure was recorded through cps [ sic ] digital technology . 
  nope . 
  gps does not record underwater structures . 
  for that you 'd need a [ side-scan sonar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/side-scan_sonar ) . 
  [ the graph ] ( http://portuguese-american-journal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pyramid.jpg ) on that page could be just about anything from systemic gps inaccuracy or equipment malfunction to him navigating in a certain pattern . 
  if he has had a simple sonar to measure also depth it could represent a low resolution depth map but depth variation might as well be caused by geological formations - especially with such low resolution . 
  that is not to say that it 's totally impossible for his graph to represent a man-made structure . 
  but as evidence it is very vague and ambiguous . 
  btw : azores do have very interesting man-made pyramid like structures : [ does the & quot ; pyramids & quot ; of the vineyard pico were already there when the portuguese arrived ?

  ` retreat !, 
  retreat !, 
  the vikings are throwing frozen poo ! ', 
   britain will have its in-out referendum in 2017 . 
  well , that is far from certain . 
   unless the eu wants to run the risk of a major member state actually leaving , it has until 2017 to transform itself into something attractive enough to make the brits want to stay of their own free will . 
  the eu needs reforms but it makes no sense to hang them on an uncertain possibility of one member having an referendum . 
   we need a new treaty , but the pirate party does not have a proposal for how that treaty should look , at least not now . 
  you say it should be ready by 2017 and you do n't have even a proposal yet . 
   a new treaty should be adopted in two steps . 
  first , there should be a pan-european referendum where each citizen has one vote , regardless of which member state he or she is a citizen of . 
  then , each member state will have to decide if it wants to be part of this new union , either by holding a national referendum or by letting their national parliament decide . 
  what purpose would it serve to do both ? 
  in the first one it would be the biggest countries with most voters having the real say . 
  only in the second one would the voters in smaller countries have a chance for their vote to actually count . 
  assuming those ` some religions ' do not include hinduism , buddhism , christianity , islam etc.

   stout and porter . 
  why british styles ? 
  can not say . 
  because they 're so good ? 
  koff porter is made with british yeast , i read from somewhere it 's guiness yeast but not sure about that . 
   no german or belgian influences in finnish beer ? 
  german influences have been huge . 
  it goes way back to bce as finns probably learned brewing beer from germanic people because many beer related words such as * olut * ( beer ) , * mallas * ( malt ) , * vierre * ( wort ) and * humala * ( hops ) are originally germanic loans . 
  through the middle ages finns brewed ales . 
  heh , in 1555 sweden 's archbishob olaus magnus wrote that drinking finnish beer grows people to endure any kind of hardship and it makes women so fertile that they mostly have twins . 
  the german influences are obvious in modern days .
