  industrial breweries started booming in the 19th century and the brewing technique with bottom-fermenting yeast was learned from bohemia . 
  during 19th century most finnish brewery masters learned their trade in germany . 
  and today the most popular type of beer over here is of course lager - not ale . 
  over here the german election has been one of the top headline news along with the nairobi attack . 
  the media has seen the election as important for finland too , and followed and commented on the campaigning .

  no news is good news , they say . 
  but honestly , i 'd be very interested to read more weekly tidbits from our southern bros and sisters - even if it 's something trivial to you guys . 
   this month , the national railroad museum was expected to open , but the project was halted . 
  i was looking forward to it sounds interesting !, 
  perhaps you could post images of your visit when it finally opens some day ? 
  over here the [ finnish railway museum 's ] ( http://rautatiemuseo.fi/finnish-railway-museum ) jewel is the unique and exuberantly luxorious tsar 's imperial train from 1870 's with tsars 's car , tsarina 's car and a saloon car .

  ** finland ** imo this weeks biggest news was : * according to a proposal in preparation recipients of social benefits could be required to work in future . 
  if they refuse , their allowances could be cut by 20-30 percent . 
  [ social benefit recipients face work requirement proposal ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/social_benefit_recipients_face_work_requirement_proposal/6840496 ) sounds like something that could go horribly wrong . 
  but depends on how such measures are implemented , and must wait and see what the proposal will actually be . 
  any good/bad experiences to share from other countries ? 
  * a shipyard will likely get closed , unless a new owner appears to run it ( perhaps russians ? 
  ) : [ stx to shutter rauma yard , 700 jobs to go ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/stx_to_shutter_rauma_yard_700_jobs_to_go/6833018 ) * nokia boss stephen elop 's $ 18.8 million bonus has been stirring public controversy .

  as the tax office has investigated the cases , they can not now be investigated by the police looking to file criminal charges . 
  the loophole will be fixed next year but that wo n't have bearing on current cases . 
  * [ finland will rise quotas and take 500 refugees from syria ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/interior_minister_finland_could_take_in_500_syrian_refugees/6838793 ) . 
  they will be granted permanent residence permits right away . 
  too low imo , but better that nothing i guess , and one has to keep in mind that those quotas are for refugees living in camps and do not apply to additional asylym seekers who may come to finland for an asylym . 
  about 52 % agree that immigration should be restricted as long as there is unemployment ( 45 % in 2011 ) . 
  yet otoh 57 % agree that everybody who wants to come to finland to live and work should be allowed . 
  needless to say the supporters of the true finns party are the least supportive of immigration by a large margin .

   is the patent on this a problem for developing this kind of technology ? 
  to the contrary . 
  because it has been patented and the patent has expired long ago , the technology is somewhat easier to develop as it has been publicly detailed in the patent and not lost into secrecy . 
  that 's also exactly the way patents are supposed to work : details of an invention get published and it enjoys a limited period of exclusive rights . 
   or any kind of direct connection between finland and the baltics . 
  is n't it possible to build a bridge there ? 
  the distance between tallinn and helsinki is about 83 km and the shortest distance between the coasts is about 50 km . 
  would be a very costly brigde if possible at all . 
  a tunnel is the less expensive option . 
  helsinki and tallinn signed a letter of intention in 2008 and since then premilinary feasibility studies have been made about a possible [ helsinki-tallinn rail tunnel ] ( http://www.gug.fi/web/page.aspx?refid=62 ) . 
  the hard crystalline bedrock is favourable for building a tunnel , though in the tallinn end it 's covered with 200m of sedimentary rock so the tunnel would probably need to run deep beneath it . 
  the geology of the underwater part needs more detailed geophysical investigations . 
  there 's also experteese of building long tunnels into bedrock such as the 120 km [ p\u00e4ij\u00e4nne water tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4ij%c3%a4nne_water_tunnel ) .

  from [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1mrj2p/unfortunate_pixel_fault_on_salford_media_city_big/ ) . 
   i have read the article you linked and that is not true . 
  they are compalining about android and mobile in particular . 
  please re-read what i wrote : the complaint is not about availability of android or about gpl or open source or free software per se . 
  here 's the crux of the complaint in other words as per [ fairsearch ] ( http://www.fairsearch.org/mobile/fairsearch-announces-complaint-in-eu-on-googles-anti-competitive-mobile-strategy/ ) : `` google achieved its dominance in the ** smartphone operating system market ** by giving android to device-makers for ` free . ' but in reality , ** android phone makers ** who want to include must-have google apps such as maps , youtube or play ** are required to pre-load an entire suite of google mobile services and to give them prominent default placement on the phone ** , the complaint says . 
  ** this disadvantages other providers ** , and puts google 's android in control of consumer data on a majority of smartphones shipped today . '', 
   it is all about bundling , which android does not have . 
  right . 
  good to hear we agree on what the complaint is about . 
  it 's about google 's behavior of bundling its software and services . 
  to that point it 's irrelevant if there 's no bundling in vanilla android as the complaint is not about that but what google does with its exclusive agreements . 
   how is google responsible for what manufacturers choose to do ? 
  they can certainly ship aosp + fdroid instead ( or any other number of app stores ) , but nobody is doing it ( google play just provides a better service ) . 
  the complaint is that when android smartphone makers want to include for example google play they also have to bundle other google 's services by default thereby limiting consumer choice . 
   no it 's about mobile as the quoted parts show . 
  mobile does include tablet , so the example is perfectly relevant . 
  it 's not . 
  the complaint is about smartphone market also sometimes colloquially referred as mobile market . 
  laptops are mobile devices too but they 're not what the complaint is about . 
  i 'm sure many would agree that kindle is not a smartphone , neither is a laptop - even if they 're both mobile devices in their own way . 
   samsung is offering their own app store as well on their phones and not all google services are available by default . 
  so it 's either with google play and other google 's services , or no default google 's services only without google play ? 
   nobody is stopping manufacturers from releasing android and bundling it with their own services , exactly like amazon , or with some other services ( you can preload it with bing , bing maps and all that ) . 
  yet the complaint is not about that . 
   android is freely available and anybody can use it as they please ( before they get threatened with lawsuits from microsoft for patent infringement that is ) . 
  their proprietary apps and play store services are not freely available and are certainly not bundled with android . 
  please remember that the complaint is not about the availability of android or about gpl or open source or free software per se . 
  it 's about google 's behaviour in the eu market regarding the exclusive agreements with smartphone manufacturers when bundling google 's services in smartphones . 
   the existence of the kindle fire , which is running android and contains zero google services is a nice example . 
  the complaint is about googles conduct in the smartphone market not tablets , and as an example the existence kindle fire is not relevant to the point . 
  demonstrating that android smartphones on the eu market actually do give the consumer the choice of whether to use google 's services or someone else 's by default would be more relevant . 
   note that windows phone is worse in this regard , because it is bundled with all of microsoft 's online crap . 
  look , i do not care about the companies or their perceived hypocrisy . 
  what i do care about is the consumer choice and competition on the market . 
  and that is what the complaint is about . 
  i do not know if the complaint merits an action , but the posted letter by fsfe certainly does not address my concerns , and i do hope the commission will take a careful look into the matter . 
  his reasoning is basically an argument from ignorance : * a balloon with sampling apparatus is send to the stratosphere . 
  * a piece of a diatom is found in the sample . 
  * says does n't know where it came from . 
  * does n't even try to compare it with the numerous earthly species of diatoms . 
  * therefore : aliens !, 
  every now and then these panspermist crackpots make similar claims and create sensationalist headlines .
