  then it gets disproven , and they keep quiet until the next time when they claim to have found alien life on earth . 
  they even have their own publication for this , the journal of cosmology , which is like the daily mail of astrobiology . 
  here 's bad astronomer 's informative take : [ has alien life been found in earth 's atmosphere ? 
  i 'm gon na go with & quot ; no & quot ; . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/09/20/et_claims_of_alien_life_in_earth_s_atmosphere_are_unfounded.html ) edit : it 's a ridiculous example of how their pseudoscience research & publish procedure works . 
  the balloon flight was july 31 , 2013 . 
  the journal of cosmology accepted the paper on august 9 , 2013 . 
  which means it took whole 10 days for them to analyze the samples , jump to their conclusions , write the paper , peer ` review ' it , and accept it . 
  10 days !, 
  lol, 
   considering android 's linkage to other google services , they may have a point ... 
  indeed . 
  the complaint is not about open source or free software per se . 
  it 's about google 's alleged anti-competitive behavior . 
  in essence it 's an anti-trust case , and the alleged predatory pricing is only a part of it . 
  the fairsearch coalition argues that google is using its de facto monopoly position in one market ( desktop search and ads ) as a leverage to squelch competition in another market ( smartphones ) by bundling . 
  according to the complaint google is using licensing to bundle its * other products and services * by requiring smartphone makers to use google 's services ( maps , youtube , search etc ) and have google 's app store as the default . 
  the crux of their complaint is : * google used its `` desktop search dominance '' to fund and give away its android operating system for free and has since taken over the market for licensable mobile operating systems . 
  * google imposes `` de facto '' anti-competitive exclusive agreements on android smartphone makers . 
  * google is leveraging its positions in desktop search and mobile os by bundling its mobile search with android `` to exclude competition in search on mobile platforms . '' * google is bundling its own mobile services in android through free preloaded apps `` in order to foreclose competing apps and service providers . '' read more : http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82706.html#ixzz2fqcbjbd9 i think their complaint does have a point . 
  the irony here is that the complaint is very similar to the one made against microsoft in the '90s when it used its monopoly position on one market ( desktop os ) to kill competition on another market ( web browsers ) by bundling . 
  i bet this [ rare drawing of a seven-legged spider ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lmyog47 ) for grand coalition . 
  germany 's federal constutional court is deciding on ecb 's bond purchasing program omt . 
  under the program the european central bank buys eurozone member-state bonds in secondary markets . 
  the complaint is about whether ecb is in breach of its mandate when doing this . 
  it seems unikely that the constitutional court would rule against it . 
  to my knowledge no other ez country has contested omt in a constitutional court . 
  here 's an interesting recent piece that touches upon that issue too : http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424127887323527004579080921405174700.html, 
  better be careful what you wish for , as there still is the matter of some 58,000 rhenish guilders from the last time : [ the vexed question of the orkney and shetland isles ] ( http://alexmasterley.blogspot.fi/2012/01/vexed-question-of-orkeys-and-shetland.html )  assuming a real interest rate of 2.125 % , payable since the death of christian i in 1481 , that would give an outstanding balance # 98,348,595,286 . 
   figures released by the state-run institute of child health show that the number of births dropped from 118,302 in 2008 to 100,980 in 2012 . 
  that 's horrible !, 
  hey wait a minute ... what 's up with picking up just two years for comparison ? 
  and why just 2008 ? 
  needs [ context ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mcyuix2 ) ( data : [ hellenic statistical authority ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye ) ) ah , okay . 
  there was a rapid boom in births which peaked around 2008-2009 and now it 's over . 
  yep , here 's [ the breakdown ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r2jzwnk2lie/ujyuoahymji/aaaaaaaagzo/lku4-il0qzc/s1600/scottish-brake-2.jpg ) . 
  fwiw do n't let the catchy headline to distract you from the point of the article which is to expound upon germany 's pretty well working apprentice system . 
  good points in the article , but i do n't get what they mean by ` back ' . 
  we still are in the euro crisis and have been for years , depending on what one means by the term . 
  are there still ez countries in debt crisis ? 
  yes . 
  are there still ez countries in danger of falling into crisis ? 
  yes . 
  are reforms still slow to happen in the ez ? 
  yes . 
   yes , the powers-that-be badly underestimated the impact of austerity on greece and portugal ... although strangely aep does n't appear to level the same criticism on britain 's own austerity policies also he suspiciously fails to mention the reasons for such underestimations , which should be apparent to anyone who actually has read the related reports and the assumptions on which such estimates were based on . 
  one of the most important being the assumption that the countries in question would actually do needed reforms in a timely manner , which as we now know failed spectacularly as an assumption . 
  one really can not predict that a country would decide to have two elections instead of actually reforming its economy and addressing its deficits . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://www.cincodias.com/5diasmedia/cincodias/media/201202/21/mercados/20120221cdscdsmer_2_pes_pdf.pdf ) old ` leaked ' imf report explains those assumptions clearly and provides different scenarios for different assumptions and greek policies . 
  also worth noting is this bolded part : * `` the debt trajectory is extremely sensitive to program delays , suggesting that the program could be accident prone , and calling into question sustainability ( table 2 ) . 
  indeed . 
  tbf they are casually often used interchangeably , but they are not the same . 
   most of greece 's new debt after the crisis struck was due to high interest rate ( as high as 60 % ) for the existing debt . 
  greece need to borrow more just to pay the interest for the existing debt . 
  here 's the [ 10 yr bond yields from 2009 - ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cusxrnk )  if the ecb would have intervened , there would have been no such interest rate and as such , little new debt . 
  the ecb began buying bonds already in the summer 2011 . 
  do you see a big effect on greece 's bond yields ? 
  for example do you see those two huge spikes starting october 2011 and continuing to the fall 2012 ? 
  that 's the instability of greece 's politics having an effect on the economy : first papandreou 's indecisiveness , then his resignation and declaration of an early election , then not one but two of those elections , then the still ongoing uncertainty when the weak greek gov still asked for 6 months more time . 
  compare the chart with the timeline : october 2009 : new government of george papandreou elected . 
  january 2010 : greece sells [ $ 8bn of 5-year bonds on the market ] ( http://euobserver.com/economic/29338 ) . 
  they sell successfully at the yield of 6.2 % . 
  see ? 
  a bit higher yield but not near what you claim . 
  february 2010 : government revises the 2009 deficit from previously estimated 5 % to 12.7 % of gdp . 
  it became apparent that greece had for many years misreported their official statistics . 
  greece warns it may need emergency loans and asks the eu to plan for it . 
  greece 's bond yields rise reflecting the risks . 
  march 2010 : greece [ sells $ 5bn of 10-year bonds on the market ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/245030a8-2773-11df-b0f1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2fbu1gimr ) . 
  they sell successfully , but their yields are higher than previously at 6.4 % . 
  see ? 
  a bit higher yield but not near what you claim . 
  april 2010 : greece reports it 's 2009 deficit is actually even bigger and gets increased to 13.6 % ( was really 15 % ) . 
  greece asks for emergency funding from imf/eu . 
  greece 's credit rating drops to trash . 
  where do you get the idea that the ecb should have or even could have prevented it ? 
  how ? 
  by buying those jan and march 2010 bonds ? 
  but greece sold them successfully in the market without needing ecb 's help . 
   when the crisis hit , greece 's debt started growing at a much higher rate than italy 's . 
  when comparing the public debts of greece and italy the most important difference is the struture of it , which for italy has been and is very different from greece 's . 
  a superficial direct comparison of debt ratios ( such as anarchisto apparently did ) does not give much insight . 
   it 's as if the government 's only reaction to the crisis was to borrow more . 
  which it , technically , was . 
  yes . 
  it was . 
  unfortunately after greece 's expansive policies through the 2000s funded with debt , they had already too much debt and too much deficit which made their economy vulnerable to instabilities . 
  and after the 2008 crisis hit their deficit soared ( 15 % ! ), 
  as did their interest rates . 
   sorry to be so blunt , but you 're repeating propaganda . 
  igelkotten 's assesment may be hyperbolic , but it is correct : up until the 2008-09 crisis hit greece 's economy had been expanding on a constant stimulus funded with debt . 
  here 's a concise analysis of it ( pg . 
  4 on [ the report ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13154.pdf ) ) : * fiscal expansion after euro accession led to a buildup of large economic imbalances . 
  * * by 2009 , both the flow and stock imbalances were among the highest in the euro area : the overall fiscal and current account balances were in double digits ( -15 1/2 and -11 percent of gdp , respectively ) , public sector debt reached 115 percent of gdp ( revised subsequently to 130 percent of gdp ) , and the net international investment position stood at -86 percent of gdp . 
  these imbalances were largely a result of fiscal expansion that was financed by external borrowing at lower post-euro accession interest rates . 
  channeled through transfers , subsidies , and investments , fiscal expansion lifted private income and consumption , which in turn boosted tax revenues and masked the true size of the underlying fiscal gap . 
  * you can also see it on the relevant indicators in these graphs : [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lt3d7qf ) and [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cvnnd4b ) see also the development of greece 's [ interest rates ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/long-term_interest_rates_of_eurozone_countries_since_1993.png ) . 
  btw , i recommend reading that imf report , it contains a lot of interesting facts about greece 's economy , the need of reforms and progress ( or lack of it ) . 
   before the crisis , greece 's debt levels have been more or less constant ( as percentage of gdp ) throughout the last two decades : you do n't see much just by looking at those numbers , you might want to take a look at the deficits for example . 
   up until 2007 , greece had a lower debt percentage of gdp than italy .
