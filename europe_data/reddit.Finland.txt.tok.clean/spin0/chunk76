  good for them , when they should have had < 60 % and should have stopped running constantly on deficit making their economy very vulnerable if unstabilities should appear . 
  and look what happened . 
  when the 2008 crisis hit greece 's deficit rose to a whopping ** 15 % ** by 2009 and the country was on the verge of default in no time . 
  edit : forgot this one . 
   italy was saved by the ecb , greece was not , because it 's not `` too big to fail '' . 
  unlike greece , italy never asked for emergency loans from the imf/eu and never needed them . 
  italy 's public debt is big but its strucure is very different from what greece had , and ecb 's bond buying program has been sufficient remedy for italy 's situation without emergency loans and defaults ( or ` haircuts ' ) like greece needed to ask for . 
   actually yes , it still works that way . 
  as radaway already said , not really - unless you get the the debtors to agree to take the losses . 
  otherwise they can and will contest it legally , which may have some pretty nasty side effects such as confiscating property where opportunity arises around the world ( e.g. 
  shipping ) . 
  case in point : dart management hedge fund had bought some of greek debt dirt cheap - at a fraction of its nominal price - from the market as it was pretty much worthless at the time with looming default and grexit an all . 
  when greece then defaulted on its debts ( or ` haircut ' as it was called ) , dart did not agree to it and were ready to contest it legally to get their money . 
  not just what they had paid for the debt , mind you , but the full nominal price . 
  greece had no choice but to yield and pay up - despite having just defaulted on other debts . 
  dart management plays pretty hard ball , all legally of course , and are ready to go pretty far to get what is theirs . 
  they also have a certain reputation to keep up , as they have successfully forced other governments to pay up after their defaults . 
  actually ecb has bought also greek bonds and quite a lot too .

   americans , this is one of the many reason the world hats you . 
  right , hats off to america !, 
   if they are unneeded why are we reducing their vacations ? 
  the greek goverment is finally reducing those vacations in an effort to cut public spending and the budget deficit because they are a completely unnecessary burden to public spending , to the taxpayers , and to the economy of greece . 
  as such it 's only a small step , yet it 's an example of the unproductiveness of their public sector wasting 5000 person-years every year in such stupidity . 
  cutting insane things like these have been on troika 's list of suggested reforms from the day one , but the greek government has been extremely slow to actually do anything about them instead making cuts to other things such as education and health care . 
   do n't forget that 50 million is nothing when talking about countries . 
  it is indeed something when trying and closing the annual budget deficits , and when making decisions from where to cut in the first place . 
  having a $ 50 million computer vacation is $ 50 million taken from somewhere else even if it 's a small sum compared to the whole budget . 
  it could give needed savings , or perhaps some of it could be spent into more urgent needs such as education or health care . 
  that is if those needs were actually seen as more urgent by the government deciding on the cuts . 
  i 've travelled often between helsinki and turku , which is about 165 km . 
  train tickets for that trip are from $ 11 to about $ 35 depending on time , season , train etc. 
  which makes about $ 6.7 to $ 21 per 100 km . 
  i 'm not sure if $ / 100 km is a very good metric in the first place . 
  yeah , i read that too but as the prices vary a lot according to area , trip , time of day , season etc that explanation does n't even beging to answer the questions . 
  he has gotten * a * price for some unknown trip in the uk , yet that does n't tell much about the average prices .

  was it the cheapest or most expensive offer for it ?

  and to the bafflement of all it 's mainly because of the 14 % vat and lack of competition on the retail market dominated by two retail chains .

  or perhaps you misunderstood what he actually said and what he may have referred to by ` signs of improvement ' . 
  generally it is common knowledge that unemployment lags economic growth depending on the flexibility of the labour market . 
  therefore signs of improvement in macroeconomy do not necessarily mean immediate improvement in unemployment . 
  that takes its own time . 
   for what it 's worth , this shows greece as consistently having a rise in unemployment around june year in year out . 
  the reported number 27.9 % is seasonally adjusted .
