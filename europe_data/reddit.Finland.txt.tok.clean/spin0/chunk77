  the unadjusted number is a bit lower : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yeex2qg ) ( [ source ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a0101/pressreleases/a0101_sjo02_dt_mm_06_2013_01_f_en.pdf ) )  however , this is just depressing . 
  it is . 
  would be interesting to see a breakdown by profession or by sector . 
  edit : did n't find such breakdown of the unemployed , but here 's the breakdown of [ job vacancies ] ( http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/esye/bucket/a0101/other/a0101_sjo41_tb_qq_01_2013_02_f_en.xls ) ( q1/2013 ) totalling 83,897 jobs : [ pie ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tqkv7dq ), 
  [ this is absolutely ridiculous  ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424127887323846504579073143248135688.html )  but the public-sector union adedy said it would fight the decision in court . 
  wait , there 's more :  `` according to the european regulation , those using a computer should take a 15-minute break every two hours , '' the general secretary ermolaos kasses said . 
  `` it is not easy to have all those breaks during the day , so it was decided back then that it should be given as a day off every two months . '', 
  \\* infinite facepalm \\*, 
  even more bizarre when one considers how many person-years that one thing alone makes :  the working hours saved by scrapping the computer leave would be the equivalent of an extra 5,000 employees , mr mitsotakis told skai tv on thursday . 
   last tuesday when speaking to a finn : `` so you do n't have electronic bus tickets in finland ??? 
  how can you live there ?? 
  uhm ... we 've actually had electronic tickets in public transport ( buses , trains , trams , metro ) for over a decade - at least in the cities where i have lived ( helsinki metropolitan , turku , oulu ) . 
  one can even buy a ticket with a cell phone . 
  perhaps that particular finnish person was not a user of public transport . 
  we also have had [ electronic id-cards ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a4hk%c3%b6inen_henkil%c3%b6kortti ) since the '90s . 
  however they have not become ubiquitous or very popular because instead of a card reader people rather use other more readily available ways to id themselves such as cell phones or their online banking id : s. for example one does n't need an electronic id card to do taxes online , or to change one 's street address , etc. 
   according to the office of national statistics , britain paid # 16.6 bn and received # 6.9 bn ( including rebate ) , therefore britain paid # 9.7 bn last year . 
  telegraph blogist 's interpretation of the numbers is not correct . 
  just for one example that sum includes duties collected on behalf of the eu . 
  as they are not uk 's monies to begin with they are not uk 's contributions . 
  and it does n't make much sense to pick a single year because the annual net contribution varies quite a lot under the period of mff . 
  this is much more accurate calculation of uk 's contributions to the eu budget through years 2000-2011 : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/wel/images/financialreport/en/annex3_1_en.png as you can see under that period the annual net contribution has varied from - $ 5,567 million to + $ 955 million or about -0.33 % - +0.06 % of uk 's gni . 
   the question is then whether a saving of # 8bn is worth everything that efta membership brings but not having eu membership loses . 
  there would be no saving of # 8bn as the net contribution would not get smaller by that much . 
  there 's also many other relevant questions such as : uk 's scientific research has received billions in funding from the eu 's science budget . 
  if the uk was to leave the eu what would that mean for the science funding in the uk ? 
  and what about uk 's audiovisual industry which also receives funding from the eu ? 
  the norwegian mission to the eu lists [ 10 basic facts about the european economic area ] ( http://www.eu-norway.org/arkiv/newsarchives/eea_agreement_facts/#.ujieaaya8vk ) . 
  according to that norway 's total financial contribution linked to the eea agreement is roughly around $ 340 million a year . 
  kinda pricey for government by fax but of course norway 's economy also benefits from the access to the common market . 
  as the gdp of the uk is about 4.9 times that of norway 's , uk 's financial contribution would be higher . 
  can not say how much it would be but 4.9 x340 million is about 1.7 billion . 
  at the same time the uk would drop from being one of the most influential countries in the eu to the ` government by fax ' system , where it would n't have much of say in many eu directives and regulations .

  then i 'll bring also arctic raspberry jam for the dessert . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  because i ca n't see anything particularly ` neoliberal ' or ` feodal ' about people training into professions where workes are actually needed . 
  sounds like common sense to me . 
   unfortunately , everyone is talking about the effects and no one has a clue about how to solve the problem . 
  the article left out that while there generally is less office and manufacture jobs at the same time there 's plenty of other professions with worker shortages : http://yle.fi/uutiset/eiko_ole_toita_naihin_ammatteihin_tarvitaan_tekijoita/6816547 one part of the solution would be to for individuals to train themselves into professions where more workers are needed . 
  [ rubus arcticus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubus_arcticus ) or arctic raspberry is indeed delicious . 
  enjoying fresh unprocessed cloudberries is a somewhat aquired taste but cloudberry jam is a different beast and a very good sweet companion to leip\u00e4juusto .

  edit : oh , and i 'll build a sauna for us to chill in and have some of those beers from all over the europe . 
  could you point out where in [ the report ] ( http://unsdsn.org/files/2013/09/worldhappinessreport2013_online.pdf ) ? 
  i could n't see it in the table of contents , and the word ` enviroment * ' does not appear in the report at all . 
  it 's already very well established in the related reseach in observations and mechanisms . 
  http://www.thl.fi/fi_fi/web/neuvoa-antavat-fi/juomisen-riskit-eivat-kosketa-vain-pienta-vahemmistoa why would n't you actually read the related research available in the links - provided you 're actually interested in the problem and and it 's dynamics and not simply in denial of it . 
   even petersburgers call finnish booze tourists `` our four-legged friends '' heh , vodka-tourism and related stereotypes go way back to the sovjet times of ' 60-80s . 
  those days few dollars or even a pair of pantyhoses could buy you a lot in the then leningrad . 
  so one can easily imagine how obnoxious some of the finnish drunken vodka-tourists must have been - and probably still are . 
  in estonia drunken finnish vodka-tourists get called * poro * which is finnish for a reindeer . 
  so a form of ` four-legged friends ' over there also . 
  perhaps , and in the northern european alcohol conga line also to finland . 
  in fact the state monopoly alcohol retail shops ( * alko * ) in northern finland near the norwegian and swedish borders have traditionally had improportionally huge sales partly bacause of customers from norway , and from sweden depending on current comparative tax situation . 
  that 's why alkos in otherwise tiny border towns such as hetta or nuorgam have been among the best selling top ten in finland . 
  not that there 's anything bad about it , to the contrary . 
  the shopping norwegians bring money to those tiny towns . 
  very big thank you to norwegians for keeping those * alkos * alive . 
  thank you very many !, 
  * benefit, 
   of course , since danes are the north 's notorious drinkers it 'll make the other countries ' politicians point at denmark and say `` see ? 
  they lowered their taxes on beer , and now they 're all drunk ! '', 
  well in finland all they have to point at are the effects of lowering the taxes in finland . 
  in 2004 finland lowered the taxes of spirits -44 % , beer -32 % and wine -10 % . 
  the effects on consumption and health effects were very clear in [ the statistics ] ( http://www.thl.fi/fi_fi/web/fi/tilastot/aiheittain/paihteet_ja_riippuvuudet/alkoholi/alkoholijuomien_kulutus ) . 
   are you sure ? 
  as per the trends in the posted survey . 
  people identifying as europeans up by 6 points from the previous survey june 2012 . 
  people feeling attached to the eu up by 2 points . 
  majority thinks their countrymen feel more european than 10 years ago . 
  majority thinks they will be more involved in european affairs by 2025 . 
  absolute majority thinks that what brings us together is more important than what separates us . 
  otoh people currently interested in european affairs is down by 8 points and majority not interested . 
   http://i.imgur.com/p8p1rzv.jpg[1] http://i.imgur.com/irtzkkh.jpg[2] http://i.imgur.com/m4em5yp.jpg[3] you do realize that these are from a different survey ( eb79 ) ? 
  in that same survey also trust to the eu has been dropping during the crisis but people still tend to trust the eu more than their national governments or parliaments . 
  please note that it 's a different survey from the posted one . 
  tuesias ' source is standard eurobarometer ( eb79 ) , and posted survey is european parliament eurobarometer ( eb79 .5 ) . 
  such as speling . 
   which of course does n't actually cover the consumption of the personally imported alcohol it does . 
  the norwegians go to finland for relatively cheap alcohol the finns go to estonia for relatively cheap alcohol, 
  apparently those doing it think it 's worth it . 
  daytrips between helsinki and tallinn start from around 20-30 euros ( or even cheaper ) so bringing a few cases of beer or cider will easily cover the price of tickets in ` savings ' . 
  yeah , but it 's all for a good cause : [ finnish booze rally helps fund estonian literature ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_booze_rally_helps_fund_estonian_literature/6784639 ),

  ** finland : ** a week of notable business aquisitions . 
  * nokia sold its mobile phone business to microsoft . 
  thousands of nokia employees in finland have been worried over the future of their jobs . 
  steve ballmer and stephen elop have reassured that finland will be `` the centre of all phone development at microsoft '' and that there are no plans to move units from finland . 
  former nokia ceo olli-pekka kallasvuo commented on the deal yesterday in a pretty open interview : [ ex-nokia boss : company became `` complacent '' ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/ex-nokia_boss_company_became_complacent/6819661 ) even former nokia ceo jorma ollila has so far declined to comment saying it 'll have to wait until his book is published next month . 
  meanwhile nokia 's share value rose from the earlier rock bottom , and company 's credit rating improved from the earlier trash . 
  * finnish design icon artek ( e.g. 
  alvar aalto furniture ) was [ bought by a swiss furniture company vitra ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/swiss_design_firm_snaps_up_artek/6818192 ) . 
  artek was previously owned by a swedish investement company proventus . 
  family-owned vitra is known for its design furniture worldwide so the deal is likely good news for artek .
