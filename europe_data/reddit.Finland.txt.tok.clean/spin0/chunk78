  * economists estimate that the very moderate pay rise deal reached last week will give some extra boost to growth , and would create even up to 20000 jobs in finland within the next two years .

  could n't help but cheer when he scored the 1-0 against finland tonight . 
  hell , we tried but did n't succeed in importing monarchy from germany . 
  no , and now our current would be king philipp robin prinz und landgraf von hessen lives in new york as a successful fashion photographer . 
  yeah , because correlation is causation . 
  meanwhile in finland we had a drastic increase of suicides with the economic boom of the '80s . 
  and it turned to a downward trend only with the early '90s devastating recession . 
  finland then had to endure one of the deepest cyclical adjustements done in the world - even bigger than for example greece . 
  right then also suicide rates turned into long term decline : http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ksyyt/2011/ksyyt_2011_2012-12-21_kat_006_en.html so should we conclude that the smaller the unemployment the more suicides ? 
  because that 's what the data suggests if we take correlation as causation without actually proving neither nor any look into all other possible factors at play . 
  that 's strange . 
  meanwhile in helsinki there 's suddenly people walking around in china themed outfits like this odd hitchhiker : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/brtl4vu ), 
  one more incentive for finland to build that new baltic sea data cable bypassing sweden , and also join the northwest passage cable project : [ government planning undersea cable link to germany ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/government_planning_undersea_cable_link_to_germany/6559084 ) and [ suomi haluaa oman tietoliikennereitin eurooppaan ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/suomi_haluaa_oman_tietoliikennereitin_eurooppaan/6559072 ) not that those would prevent eavesdropping and data theft , but the current situation where by far most traffic goes through sweden is not good . 
  this is a bit of an anatomic nitpick , but i guess useful to know : complete removal of clitoris would be a * very * challenging operation as clitoris is quite large organ and mostly internal . 
  really fun fact is that only 1998 was the true anatomy of clitoris described in a medical journal . 
  here 's a good introduction to the related anatomy , and how science eventually discovered clitoris : http://www.skepticink.com/incredulous/2013/08/12/the-clitoris-revealed-and-how-io9-got-it-wrong/, 
   he specifically stated that they are not equivalent ( although he got the genders backwards , presumably by accident ) . 
  no , there is no mistake and his post is factually correct as is . 
  the most common form of male genital mutilation ( removal of foreskin ) really is worse than the most common forms of female genital mutilation ( scratching or making an incision on the clitoral hood ) . 
  the problem with discussing fgm is that all forms of it are clumped together with no differentiation on what is actually done , why is it done , and how prevalent different forms actually are . 
  that 's why for some all fgm equals to some form of pharaotic circumcision or removal of clitoris or such . 
  yet the truth is that not all fgm are the same , and the most prevalent forms are actually not even that invasive , and do not suppress sexuality or sexual pleasure . 
  in fact making an incision on clitoral hood enhances sexual stimulus during intercourse , which is the reason why some western women choose to do it . 
   the comparison is between the most commonly used forms foreskin removal and clitoral removal one is clearly much much worse . 
  yet clitoral removal is not the most common form of fgm . 
  scrathcing or making a small incision on the clitoral hood is . 
  that is much less invasive and damaging procedure than removal of male foreskin is . 
  \\ o / gerald lee jr ftw swe 60 - fin 81 again finland had top notch defence . 
  yeah , he should have named it `` progressive liberal democratic party of russia '' . 
   this might seem little , but when inevitably technological advancements will require new standards to be adopted , they will be negotiated between american and asian companies , with the european market as a passive afterthought . 
  it 's mainly the network companies and operators who set the relevant standards for mobile comms , not that much the consumer device manufactures . 
  and europe and european companies are very well positioned for developing and setting the future network standards ( e.g. 
  ericsson , nokia etc ) . 
  next step for europe : building g4, 
  and ms also took the billions of debts with it which makes the total about $ 9-10 bn . 
  meanwhile the leaner nokia will be both profitable and have about $ 5 bn in its coffers . 
  expect growth and strategic business aquisitions to support growth in its core businessess : networks and related services . 
  ms got what it wanted ever since steve ballmer set his eyes on nokia years ago . 
  now ballmer and ms are in a position where failure is not an option . 
  they need market share in the mobile markets , and lots of it . 
  their platform needs it . 
  ballmer needs it . 
  that 's the way he and ms has always operated . 
  they have deep pockets , and they 're known as very competitive company . 
  failure is not an option , so they will invest heavily into this . 
  never mind about him . 
  it was a good deal both for nokia and ms. 
  perhaps you 're joking , or perhaps it 's about perceptions and you see nokia solely as the phone maker for consumers . 
  it 's not , and never has been . 
  it was a good deal . 
  and it made a lot of sense to get rid of the phone business . 
  with it nokia lost about half of its size but also the huge losses and debts of it . 
  nokia will be leaner . 
  and nokia will be profitable . 
  after getting rid of the loss-generating phone business nokia can concentrate on its profitable businesses . 
  after the deal nokia will have no debts . 
  actually after the deal nokia will have about $ 5 bn in its coffers , plus in the future what ms will pay for licences to nokia 's patents which it will need . 
  it would make no sense at all to dismantle nokia . 
  there 's plenty of start-ups and spin-offs in finland already anyway , and good luck for them all . 
  for nokia the next step is growth . 
  the core businesses will be mobile networks and related services . 
  nokia already bought siemens out of nsn . 
  we have n't seen all of it yet . 
  with $ 5 bn in the coffers expect more business aquisitions . 
  whoa . 
  de-fence !, 
  everything went better than expected . 
  immigration is not about making ` dents ' anyway . 
  people are not passive gumballs , they 're active agents . 
  the whole analogy is poorly constructed , and does not address anything relevant . 
   i imagine there must be . 
  indeed . 
  nokia became a national icon . 
  it 's not that finland did n't have internationally successful companies before , we did and still have . 
  but not as huge as nokia in size or global impact . 
  nokia was * the * company that helped finland to rise from the devastation of the early '90s recession . 
  of course it was n't nokia alone , but at times nokia brought in about 10 % of finland 's gdp . 
  nokia was also the ultimate yes we can . 
  despite being from a small country at the edge of the world , yes we can go out there and not just follow but lead and actually create whole new markets and industries . 
  and that i think is the true legacy of nokia .
