  and as such it is n't exclusively for finns but also europe and others . 
   a country with a population smaller than just of the bay area 's built one of the most dominant companies in the world . 
  yeah , we really did change the world , did n't we ? 
   * `` hello , world . 
  this is finland speaking . 
  we bring you the gift of connecting people . 
  for now on everybody 's productivity will multiply . 
  '' * * `` shut up and please take my money !, 
  '' * okay , that 's not how it really happened . 
  there were also other relevant players bringing on the revolution , developing tech , setting standards and creating markets such as our western bros sweden . 
  and nokia and finland did n't suddenly come out of nowhere with the mobile communication know-how . 
  there actually had been a long and persistent development work going on in finland with the first public commercial mobile phone network going back to '60s . 
  and by ' 70-80s we the nordic countries were at the forefront in digitalization of phone networks , and also in mobile phone networks and roaming - both as partners and competitors . 
  the world 's first fully automatic mobile phone network with roaming developed in the '70s was n't called nmt for nothing ( * nordic * mobile telephone ) . 
  perhaps what set nokia most apart from many other players was the vision : `` guise , in the future everybody will want a mobile phone . 
  everybody . 
  let 's put all in , and do it . '', 
   probably the finish government oh noes . 
  i do n't think so , and surely hope not . 
  that would n't make economic sense , would be like turning back the time over 20 years , and would go against the main tenets of state ownership over here ( strategic or profitable ) . 
  finnish government does own some nokia shares ( 0.75 % ) through the state 's pension fund . 
  but it would make no sense to own a whole failing phone business as that would essentially mean losing money for unforeseeable future until someone else would buy it from the gov. 
  owning it would mean paying for its losses , and would get costly to the taxpayers and to the state 's budget year by year . 
  in a scenario you described i could see finnish government buying perhaps a 10-20 % share of the phone business as a strategic investment to ensure the company stays in finland if that 's deemed strategically important then . 
  but not the whole business , that would need private investors . 
  here 's what state 's investment company solidium [ currently owns ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/solidium#salkku ) . 
  the state also has some direct ownerships which are considered strategically important for the country . 
  the state has majority ownerships of companies finnair , fortum and neste oil and wants them all be profitable but finnair has not always been . 
   honestly , i think it 's actually a good deal for nokia . 
  so do i. 
  the more i think about it the more sense it makes . 
  as an end of an era of finnish industrial history there 's of course sad sentiments . 
  but the deal includes also opprtunities , and the potential for new growth for nokia . 
  well as nokia will keep its brand it 's very unlikely but not completely impossible . 
   imho nokia trademark worth more :( but the nokia brand was not sold in [ the deal ] ( http://press.nokia.com/2013/09/03/nokia-to-sell-devices-services-business-to-microsoft-in-eur-5-44-billion-all-cash-transaction/#sthash.tqawvrqk.dpuf ) : * `` microsoft has agreed to a 10 year license arrangement with nokia to use the nokia brand on current mobile phones products . 
  nokia will continue to own and maintain the nokia brand . 
  under the terms of the transaction , microsoft has agreed to a 10 year license arrangement with nokia to use the nokia brand on current and subsequently developed products based on the series 30 and series 40 operating systems . 
  upon the closing of the transaction , nokia would be restricted from licensing the nokia brand for use in connection with mobile device sales for 30 months and from using the nokia brand on nokia 's own mobile devices until december 31 , 2015 . 
  '' * the licencing deal of the nokia brand covers * current * phone products , and future products based on the * series 30 & 40 * os . 
   i do n't know but this makes me really sad . 
  it 's an end of an era . 
  nokia has been a remarkable company and very important for finland . 
  now that part of finnish industrial history is , well , history and there 's always sentiments of sadness when such happens . 
  but it 's not the end of the world or even the end of nokia . 
  nokia continues its profitable businesses as smaller tech company but without the weight of losses in the phone business . 
  the more i think about it the more sense the deal makes and the more i see the silver linings and opportunities of it . 
  and on the other hand it seems that microsoft is very serious about entering the phone business and willing to invest into it here in finland . 
  so steve ballmer may actually mean it when he says there will be no translocation of jobs from finland . 
  but we 'll see about that . 
   because i would n't have thought finland was the kind of country that would inflate their way out of a recession . 
  indeed . 
  that would be a short sighted policy even if we had the possibility . 
  and i 'm glad the finnish politicians do not have that button available any more , because even if it had ` do not press ! ', 
  in huge flaming letters there would always be that one fool to press it . 
   or are there other factors beside monetary policy you blame ? 
  oh , there 's quite many : * changes in the global markets ( paper and paper mill exports , nokia etc ) * less demand globally with the recession * globally less investments and postponements of them with the financing crisis ( exports of machinery etc ) * pricing of work and pricing of products ( -  outsourcing to china & india ) * etc , etc to claim that the euro is * the * reason is a very shallow analysis indeed . 
  yet it is true that cheaper euro would help exports to some extent . 
  would not solve the problems of finland 's industry and economy though . 
   euro membership is the most common explanation to this i have n't heard of it as a ` most common ' explanation except among some pundits and random net posters . 
  certainly having cheaper euro would help finnish exports to an extent , but that 's hardly the only or even the biggest reason for the slowing down of exports . 
  reasons are many , and its shallow to pick just one and claim it as * the * reason . 
  edit : and cheaper euro would not solve the problems of for example changing global market , and structural and competitiveness problems of finland 's industry and economy . 
   stunning thanks but no thanks . 
  yeah , those were interesting times indeed . 
  incidently the nuclear balance in finland will probably stay that way even in the future but not for the same reasons . 
  the map is outdated as a new npp is in the plans and finnish energy consortium fennovoima has a licence to build that sixth one . 
  and just today they announced that it would likely be an [ aes-2006 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aes-2006#vver-1200 ) pressurised water reactor from the russian state nuclear company rosatom : [ fennovoima taps russian supplier for nuke project ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/fennovoima_taps_russian_supplier_for_nuke_project/6812319 ), 
   what i wonder is why finland has two soviet designed reactors ? 
  because finland bought two reactors from the sovjet atomenergoeksport in the '70s for the [ loviisa npp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loviisa_nuclear_power_plant ) . 
  their original type is vver-440 model v230 but so many changes were made that they are usually not listed as such . 
  sometimes they get referred as ` eastinghouse ' reactors because they incorporated also western ideas and components . 
  for example the ice-condenser type containment buildings are by westinghouse . 
  but i guess your question is why did finland buy those in the first place ? 
  two big reasons were the [ bilateral clearing trade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bilateral_trade ) with the su , and finland 's position during the cold war . 
  the trade between finland and the su was based on barter and not on payments with currency . 
  finland exported so and so many items of clothing , rolls of paper , machinery , icebrakers or locomotives , and sovjet union paid with oil , cheap ladas , or other stuff such as the two npps . 
  so with the npps finland got useful stuff for its exports to the su , and its industry got besides more energy also more opportunities to export . 
  so it was a pretty good deal . 
  the other big reason was finland 's precarious geopolitical position during the cold war . 
  on one hand finland was under constant pressure from moscow and the possibility of it offering some ` friendly military consultation ' , and the other hand the good ole usa had nuclear targets in finland . 
  in this regard it was essential for finland to keep the appearences of neutrality . 
  often it was taken to the extreme by carefully buying stuff of strategic value from * both * the west * and * the su . 
  for example finland always bought half of its fighter jets from the west ( e.g. 
  [ draken ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_35_draken ) ) , and the other half from the su ( e.g. 
  this also extended to npps as finland bought two reactors from the su , and two other cutting edge reactors from asea-atom sweden . 
  therefore one could see the buying of those npps also as a symptom of [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) . 
  but the reactors themselves have worked well . 
  in fact the needed design changes with additional safety features did have an effect on sovjet design thinking , and some say there 's discernible pre-loviisa and post-loviisa eras in sovjet reactor designs . 
   for example , soviet reactors were ( all or mostly , i am not quite sure ) graphite moderated . 
  there 's many different types and many different designs of nuclear fission reactors . 
  this has been the case also in the sovjet union and russia where you 'll find also other types such as pwrs . 
  some of the sovjet npp reactor designs have been graphite moderated . 
  of these the early generation [ rbmk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rbmk ) design blew up in chernobyl . 
  currently there are about [ 30 npps operating ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_reactors#russia ) in russia and of these 10 are graphite moderated rbmk-1000 type reactors . 
  also many western reactor designs have used , still use ( [ agr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advanced_gas-cooled_reactor#current_agr_reactors ) ) , and will use graphite as a moderator in the probable future designs ( [ pbr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pebble-bed_reactor ) ) . 
  the reactor 's safety depends on its type and design . 
  you can not simply clump all graphite moderated designs together and imply them unsafe because of chernobyl . 
   so the distinction is still relevant . 
  as a distinction regarding npp safety it 's pretty meaningless , as it 's the type , design and running of the reactor that mostly affects its safety , not as much the country of origin . 
   the designs themselves were also quite dated and inherently unstable .
