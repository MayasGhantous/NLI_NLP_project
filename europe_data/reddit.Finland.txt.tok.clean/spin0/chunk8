  and to add to the confusion at least one of the paintings in the album is not from the 19th cent but much later , and one of them is not by a finnish painter at all . 
  but as i said , too lazy to go through all of them .

  and in 2006 it was ranked as the # 3 most beloved finnish painting of all time . 
  why ? 
  well , probably because its popularity surged during the winter war and has remained high ever since . 
  and when looked at in that perspective it undeniably has it all . 
  ah , burning charcoal is a very different process and does not work on open air as then you 'll get ash . 
  for charcoal and also for pine tar , which used to be the biggest finnish export especially to the british in the 18-19th cent , you 'd need to dig a pit first . 
  then carefully load the timber into it to get optimal results , cover it , keep the air intakes in check , and burn it very very slowly in almost no oxygen conditions . 
  i 'm lucky to have an old pine tar pit near my family 's summer cottage in the northern finland . 
  a very elaborate construction .

  yep , in finland slash-and-burn was the primary method of farming for centuries since at least 2400-2200 bc and continued until 18-19th cent . 
  in the method trees were cut and some collected , the remaining biomass was left to dry , the area was burned , and then farmed for some years . 
  the painting depicts the burning phase . 
  despite the bad reputation slash-and-burn farming was apparently sustainable in finland . 
  because of slow rotation of farming areas and low population density the method provided relatively good crops , did n't destroy ecosystems and actually gave room for new ones which are now endangered . 
  here 's an interesting paper : [ sustainability in danger ? 
  slash-and-burn cultivation in nineteenth-century finland and twentieth-century southeast asia ] ( http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3985685?uid=3737976&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104804469767 )  we claim that slash-and-burn agriculture can , under certain circumstances , be considered sustainable , although ecological sustainability is very difficult to prove , and questions concerning social and economic sustainability also must be taken into account . 
  history , however , shows that slash-and-burn cultivation has for centuries provided a basis for some fairly sustainable societies . 
  in addition , swidden agriculture ought to be evaluated in a regional context , because other agents and external factors also determine how environmentally sound slash-and-burn is . 
  hence slash-and-burn agriculture can not a priori be condemned as a destructive and untenable method of cultivation .

   why are you angry ? 
  you mispelled amused . 
   did i say something that offended you ? 
  not at all . 
   i just wanted clearification on whether will it be a nato thing or a usa-romania thing . 
  i believe i already provided the relevant clarification before your tangent to other things . 
  yeah , good for you . 
  like i said the neighborhoods in the middle east have been nothing but peaceful last few decades , and the everlasting nature of the personal friendship of your family of power with gadaffi is just one more example of the enduring stability on the region . 
  with such far lasting friendships i 'm quite sure you 'll never need a short-to-mid range missile shield . 
  to be onest , after your arguments it does seem kinda wasteful project . 
  perhaps some money could be saved by excluding specifically greece from the missile shield . 
  being such friends with gadaffi there absolutely wo n't be no worries never ever . 
  albeit , and this may be only rumours , i have never met gadaffi personally , but i 've heard he stinks . 
  yes , i read and understood your point the first time you wrote it . 
  what i do n't understand is why you so consistently have failed to understand my replies to you . 
  do you know how much 83 billion cubic meters of natural gas is in terms of domestic heating consumption ? 
  to put it bluntly : the range you 're quoting does not mean that . 
  and if you do believe it does then facepalms for failing physics . 
  also chem and biological . 
  well , good for you for never needing a short-to-mid range missile shield , then . 
  and i have also heard the neighborhoods in the middle east have been nothing but peaceful last few decades . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure your gas boiler wont . 
  but if it actually requires more than * 83 billion cubic meters * of gas to run i 'd say ditch the damned thing . 
  i mean , most other gas boilers run with much much less than that . 
   is it going to be a nato base or just a usa base ? 
  it 's part of the nato missile defence system phase two designed to protect southern europe from short-to-mid range ballistic missiles . 
  as per the treaty with romania the us will build , maintain , and operate the land-based bmd site in romania . 
  so do n't worry , you greeks get that part of the missile shielding capability as a freebie , wo n't cost you guys a cent - albeit i 'm not sure how well you 're covered with that station alone . 
  ah , but the joke 's on them as putin is a great athlete and sportsman as exemplified by the fact that he already has the much coveted super bowl ring : [ patriots ' robert kraft : vladimir putin stole my super bowl ring ] ( http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/22429359/patriots-owner-robert-kraft-vladimir-putin-stole-my-super-bowl-ring ), 
  [ `` halv liter ! '', 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=susrm6aclbo ), 
  this is 2014 , not 2007 . 
  with the 83 bcm storage capacity and related reverse flows you can run domestic heating for a long time . 
  unfortunately i do n't have the time to check if your numbers based on your assumptions are in fact correct . 
  but , if you like , you can easily find accurate and most up-to-date data on the relevant eurostat tables yourself . 
  for example on their wiki : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/energy_production_and_imports or on their database portal : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/energy/data/database  this is indeed far from the picture i sketched , you are right . 
  it is , however , not as small as you sketched either . 
  fortunately these are all small countries . 
  i wonder how long it 'll take before the problems are solved , though . 
  the problem in your assessment is not merely your estimates of numbers but your oversimplified reliance on those percentages . 
  in case of sudden stop of russian gas and/or oil imports the relevant questions would be : 1 . in short term : how big are the available storaged reserves ? 
  ( i 'm skipping oil/coal/etc energy storages here , look into it yourself ) currently the eu natural gas storage reserves are at over 77 bcm , or at about 93 % of the full 83 bcm storage capacity ( [ see this table and the relevant graphs ] ( http://transparency.gie.eu/index.php ) ) . 
  that amount corresponds roughly to about half of the annual natural gas imports from russia - remember that russia is only the second largest supplier with less than 30 % of eu natural gas imports . 
  in terms of volume if the russian gas tap would get suddenly closed tomorrow the eu has an equivalent of about six months of russian gas supply already in storages . 
  in terms of energy content the current reserve is roughly 3000 pj or about 17 % of eu total annual natural gas energy consumption of about 18000 pj . 
  with such storaged reserve , if russian gas taps were suddenly closed , and even if there were no additional measures in place such as fuel replacing , prioritizing or energy saving , no-one would freeze to death next winter provided there 's enough injection capacity from the storages to the consumers in different countries . 
  but * without any other measures * after few months there likely would be supply shortages of natural gas in some countries without the russian supply ( varies between countries ) . 
  2 . in short-to-mid term : how large share of it can be replaced by other sources of energy ? 
  again varies greatly between countries . 
  for example in finland it is required by law to have at least five months of fuel supplies in storage ( not natural gas ) in case of supply disruptions , and also required that power stations using natural gas are able to switch to other fuels at will or replaced with other capacity . 
  regarding other countries here 's a very informative read , albeit it does n't cover all eu members : [ energy supply security : the emergency response of iea countries - 2014 edition ] ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/energy-supply-security-the-emergency-response-of-iea-countries-2014.html ) 3 . in the short term and long : to what extent the russian energy can be replaced by other suppliers , fuels , or energy sources ? 
  for example , there are many oil exporters in the world , and even if a country is currently importing most of its oil from russia does not mean it * has to * nor that russia is the only possible supplier that can not be replaced in the short-to-mid term . 
  but natural gas is likely much more difficult to replace in short-to-mid term due to dependence on the current pipeline infrastucture . 
  what i 'm getting at is that merely looking at your ( assumed ) percentages does not tell us that much by itself . 
   and here we do find a lot of countries in the 80-100 region . 
  pls just stop right there , and take a look at the graph i posted previously . 
  you 'll find only some countries having up to 30-40 % natural gas of their energy mix . 
  what you now mean with the 80-100 region is totally different thing : it indicates how much of natural gas is from russia , not how much of energy consumption is natural gas . 
  for example , sweden uses very little natural gas . 
  even if 100 % of that tiny amount of gas is from russia sweden is hardly dependend on it . 
  and while finland currently gets 100 % of its natural gas from russia , that gas is only about 10 % of all primary energy usage and would be replaced by other sources of energy if it was cut off . 
   although the continent itself may only use oil for 20 % of its power consumption ( which i think is a too low estimate , but i 'm on a simple android now , ca n't find good sources quickly ) , some eastern european countries rely on it in the 80-100 % region . 
  [ national shares of fuels in gross inland energy consumption , 2012 , percentage ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/0/0b/f6_eu28_gross_inland_energy_consumption_3_2012.png ) only cyprus and malta have that big share of oil in their energy mix . 
  while i do n't know how much of that oil is russian i do believe it would be possible to use oil also from other suppliers if necessary . 
   i do n't know how much reserves there are , almost 80 bcm in oct 8 , graph : http://transparency.gie.eu/index.php/graphs?code=99_99_99 also , here 's an informative related resource : [ energy supply security : the emergency response of iea countries - 2014 edition ] ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/energy-supply-security-the-emergency-response-of-iea-countries-2014.html ),
