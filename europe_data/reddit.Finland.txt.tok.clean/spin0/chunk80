  yes , one could call for example an early generation [ rbmk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rbmk ) design as inherently unstable ( chernobyl ) , but that does not apply to all designs of different types even in the sovjet era . 
   it 's still relevant because that 's when they were built , and they were certainly perceived ( i do n't know for sure ) to be lax on regulations at the time . 
  depends on where they were built and the relevant regulations there . 
  for example the [ loviisa npp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loviisa_nuclear_power_plant ) in finland has two pressurised water reactors from sovjet atomenergoeksport . 
  their original type was vver-440 model v230 but so many changes were made that they are usually not listed as such . 
  sometimes they get referred as ` eastinghouse ' reactors because they incorporated also western ideas and components . 
  for example the ice-condenser type containment building is by westinghouse . 
   i think it should differentiate between soviet vs. post soviet which it does n't for some reason . 
  there 's also pre-loviisa and post-loviisa eras concerning additional safety features of sovjet pwrs . 
  til ` hey , slavs ' exists . 
  having only read a passing mention of it in * the good soldier \u0160vejk * was n't sure if of joke . 
  i wonder if russia has had the foresight to also ban [ homokaasu ] ( http://everything2.com/title/homokaasu ) . 
   moreover , their interest rate is significantly higher than that which your own government has to pay to finance itself . 
  for example for the bilateral loans of the first greece bailout the interest is 1.5 % which is actually below the borrowing costs of some of the lending countries and makes it effectively a money transfer from them . 
  and for the second greece bailout through the efsf the interest is at cost . 
  where 's the profit in those ? 
  and that 's not all . 
  these loans which do n't produce much profit , but indeed losses to some , are high risk exposures themselves . 
  for example try selling $ 1 bn of finland 's loan to greece on the market and it would be trash worth only a fraction of its nominal value . 
  such exposures have an effect on the interest rates and credit ratings of the lending countries , and for example finland has already been warned about this regarding its current aaa rating . 
  in 2012 finland 's share of the financial help to crisis countries was about $ 36.4 bn in payments , loans , guarantees and commitments . 
   `` the functioning economics [ sic ] of northern europe '' borrow money cheaply and then lend it dearly to the `` southern parasites '' . 
  the south is sending its tax money north , not the other way around . 
  nice racket !, 
  this is not an accurate assessment about the loans at all . 
  never mind .

  dna 's 4g lte network currently covers largest city areas only .

   i think estonian is n't as pretty . 
  to me it 's the other way round . 
  to my ear estonian has a beautiful , mysterious rolling klang which brings up images of seas to my mind . 
  some hang the clich\u00e9 of elvish tongue on finnish , but to me it 's estonian that sounds like elvish . 
  and so happy too , for example listening to estonian girls speaking is like birds singing .

  i put it first as ` some pot ' but then thought that let 's go with a less obvious misprint with more plausible deniability in the peer review . 
  should be a saucepan anyway . 
  i 'll just add this finnish related news from russia . 
  russia 's ministry of education made a legislative change that makes it possible to study finnish as a long a-language in whole russia . 
  moscow also accepted new finnish textbooks for usage in the whole country . 
  at the same time changes are also planned in finland to make it easier to study russian as a a-language and b2-language . 
  i welcome both efforts . 
  not sure if its a good or bad thing , just giving the heads up in case you want to brace yourselves .

  i do n't get what 's the point of your anecdote and what it has to do with anything . 
  a random guy said something silly . 
  what power does this guy have on your economy anyway ? 
  has your pm discussed the issues further with him ? 
  what were the results ? 
   this his a story pedro passos coelho told in the election campaign , lol , whatever it takes to try and win an election ... 
  i hope he also discussed real issues in his campaign . 
   cuts to family benefits to counter an increasing number of elderly . 
  what could possible go wrong ? 
  reforms and savings are made pretty much across the board and pretty much everybody is going to have to tighten their belts in one way or the other . 
  there 's no good reason to pick just single one and claim that this is * the * cut to counter what 's coming as it really is not the income transfer to the pensioners . 
  that rhetorical trick is a big reason why making cuts and reforms is politically often like pulling teeth . 
  in the book of political false dilemmas it goes like this : `` opposed to change something ? 
  pick something else , put those two together even if they 're not the same , contrast these two , and present it as a choice between them . 
  bonus points if you can add * think of the children * somewhere in there . '', 
  the current system where a parent can stay at home for three years with child home care support is very generous . 
  to change it to 1 1/2 + 1 1/2 years is still generous . 
  the main point of the change is not that much to get direct savings , but to have parents to stay out of working life for shorter periods of time as it affects their working carees and thereby also productivity and competitiveness ( try thinking about it from the pov of an employer , and i 'm quite sure you 'll get the idea ) . 
  will be interesting to see what kind of long term effects it has on gender equality as currently it is most often the mother that chooses to stay out of working life for the three years on child home care support . 
  you missed the operative word * average * . 
  in finland you can retire to an old age pension when about 63-68 years of age . 
  the old-age pension payable under the national pension system begins at age 65 , and you can postpone it , or you can apply for an early one after you 're 62 . 
  the article is talking about the * average * age of retirement which currently is 60.9 years and the government wants it to raise by 1 1/2 years to 62.4 in an effort to have people working longer on average . 
  at the same time they want people to start their working careers earlier by 1/2 year on average by keeping the student allowances on the same level but shortening their length . 
  all in all their aim is that people effectively have 2 years longer working careers on average , and presented a set of various measures to achieve it . 
  so how come the * average * retirement age is so different from standard old age pension of 65 years ? 
  that 's because there are different pensions for different groups of people .
