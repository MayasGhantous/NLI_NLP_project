  as you mentioned ports the piraeus port seem to do better after the chinese bought it : [ chinese push piraeus ' port growth ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/04/06/chinese-push-growth-piraeus-port/ ) ** '' ... traffic has more than trebled ... as many as 125,000 new jobs in the local economy by 2018 ... '' **  public sector jobs are not that many . 
  we have fewer public sector workers per capita than germany does . 
  yes , germany can into large public sector without going bankcrupt - as can nordics . 
  but it needs to be kept in check with constant evaluations , and making reforms and cuts where applicable to save money and to enhance its productivity and efficiency . 
  i do support our nordic welfare model with big public sector , but one has to be very careful with it . 
  and no gov job should be for life by default . 
   why do we have to change those things ? 
  i think poul thomsen from imf puts it better than i could here : [ greece makes progress , but more effort needed to restore growth ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/car060513a.htm ) * `` another very important area where greece needs to make improvements is on reforming the public sector to reduce costs and improve efficiency . 
  there have been no mandatory dismissals yet in the public sector , despite widespread job losses in the private sector . 
  those in the public sector who are unqualified or low performing have continued to have protected jobs , making it more difficult to improve the quality of public services and hire better qualified workers from the large ranks of the unemployed . 
  '' * * `` greece is well on its way to completing its fiscal consolidation , but it still has some way to go . 
  in this regard , much of the fiscal adjustment in 2014 is assumed to come from reforms that are clearly still running behind , notably reforms to improve tax collections and to modernize the public sector , including making room to hire new talent by being more willing to layoff those who do not perform . 
  '' * please read the very informative report : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13154.pdf  and even if we do , i do n't feel like the troika should have anything to do with it . 
  too late lamenting that . 
  in 2010 your government asked for financial assitance programme from the eu and imf . 
   are structural reforms demanded actually ? 
  oh , come on . 
  it 's been one of the top points of every freaking imf report ever since greece asked for financial assitance from the eu and imf . 
   i only read about firing public servants ( not necessarily the ones that got the job illegally ) , a more regressive tax system and selling public assets . 
  how about reading the actual documents : http://www.imf.org/external/country/grc/index.htm, 
   the same economists that thought austerity would work ? 
  i do n't know their thoughts on other issues , but irrelevant . 
  my point was that the guy in the posted piece is talking out of his ass when he claims :  instead , the eu , led by germany , decided to `` rescue '' greece by offering it massive fresh borrowing , while forcing it to submit to severe austerity and wage cuts . 
  it was the greek government who decided to ask for a bailout from the eu and imf . 
  because after running the numbers -- the * real * numbers as previous government ( s ) had been lying about them -- they came to conclusion that a default was worse option . 
  asking for a bailout was greece 's own decision . 
  pretending that it was n't , and even worse that somehow everyone else is responsible is silly . 
  i take it you do n't believe austerity works . 
  when you do n't have enough money to cover your public expenses it makes quite a lot sense to actually make cuts to those expenses . 
  in fact it 's pretty much the only option you have . 
  then you have less expenses to cover . 
  and yes , making those cuts does hurt , but the sooner you get to it the smaller and shorter the suffering . 
  prolonged indecisiveness will cost and hurt a lot more , and will only serve to prolong and deepen the agony . 
  with the 13-15 % deficit swiftness would have been even more crucial . 
  otoh austerity does not magically bring you instant growth . 
  making cuts to public spending hurts . 
  yet austerity can help growth in the medium and long term if doing it reduces barriers to growth , or if it is applied to enhance for example productivity or competitiveness . 
  and yes , it hurts , but i think i already said that . 
  it hurts . 
   anyway . 
  what i see a lot in those `` greek crisis '' threads ( not from you personally , of course ) is the words `` not good for greece '' when you really mean to say a ) `` not good for the eu '' , b ) `` not good for the creditors of greece '' or c ) `` not good for the people who want to invest money in greece . '', 
  why not both ? 
  after all we 're in the same boat my fellow european and eurozoner . 
  your government may have cheated to get into the boat , but i hold no grudge against you ( just do n't ask me to trust greece  . 
  so if , for example , something is good for the people who want to invest money in greece it generally is good for greece too . 
  though i 'm sure exceptions to that may exist , as always . 
   i am aware that all those things are connected and that one influences the other but , when i say `` the good of greece '' i am talking about myself , my family and anyone else who lives there . 
  i hear you . 
  you take good care of yourself and your loved ones . 
   i do not give a fuck about the creditors or the investors because i know they do not give a fuck about me either . 
  well , that 's unfortunate to hear . 
  a year ago finland 's share of the financial help to crisis countries was about [ $ 36.4 bn ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/naista_paloista_suomen_sitoumukset_kriisimaille_muodostuvat/6222222 ) in payments , loans , guarantees and commitments . 
  so far we have provided assistance to iceland , latvia , portugal , ireland , greece ... etc. 
  at the same time finland has had to struggle with its own deficit , productivity and competitiveness . 
  in fact just today the finnish coalition government announced wide set of structural reforms and savings of about $ 9 bn . 
  it was a very difficult decision for the coalition with six parties from right to left . 
  yet the majority of finns do recognize the need for such austerity , and supports reforms and savings ( [ yle survey : finns are ready for structural reforms ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/yle_survey_finns_are_ready_for_structural_reforms/6782661 ) . 
  finland 's public debt is approaching 60 % of gdp . 
  that may not sound like much , but if deficit is not kept in check the debt will quickly grow to unsustainable levels with raising interests , and that would mean goodbye nordic welfare model and finland as we know it by 2020-30 . 
  that assessment by professor hans-werner sinn has many vague claims and conclusions . 
  when reading it like a wikipedia editor i felt like adding far too many [ citation needed ] s , [ by who ] s , [ how many ] s , and [ what ] s to actually take that piece seriously . 
   so , you think the only reason the richer countries have n't given any investment money to greece is corruption , right ? 
  he pointed out corruption and inefficiency . 
  besides corruption greece 's economy still has a lot of for example unneccessary bureacracy , regulations , clientelism , and artificial barriers which create inefficiencies and drag down competitiveness . 
  in the long run greece needs a functioning investment enviroment to attract foreign investments . 
   by that logic , why have they not given any investment money to other crisis-stricken countries that are less corrupt ? 
  the richer countries already ** do give ** such funding by billions per year . 
  for example greece has received billions every year ever since joining in 1981 . 
  here 's for example [ years 2007-2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jb5okba )  you take a real , negative issue that troubles the greek political sphere but sneakily use it to rationalise and justify inflicting punishment and suffering on a whole people . 
  the point of demanding the neccessary structural reforms is not punishment . 
  the point is to get reforms to * actually happen * . 
  and as to suffering it 's your government who makes the decisions . 
  they could have made quite a many difficult but neccessary decisions a lot earlier which would have made the worst pain pass quicker , but they did n't and dragged their feet instead ( which was the biggest single reason for the need to change the imf estimated multiplicators and debt trajectories ) . 
  one reason for such behavior is clientelism : you do n't dare to fire redundant public officials when you loose their million votes in doing so . 
  everybody knows that cuts do hurt , and i do remember how it was here in finland in the early '90s with the devastating recession . 
  luckily finland just and just managed to keep itself in the loan market albeit with an awful rating . 
   on the other hand , greece is not argentina . 
  greece 's situation and the structures of its economy are indeed different from argentina 's . 
  that 's also why when the greek government run the numbers with economists ( including argentinians ) in 2009/10 they came to conclusion that a default was the worse option , and opted to ask a bailout program from the eu and imf . 
   i was under the impression that this was already done . 
  that portugal was already under the supervision of the so-called troika until they got their deficit spending to 3 % . 
  yes , it was done with the bailout package ( though was not facilitated within esm as did n't exist yet ) . 
  but still any * new * financial assistance programme will also need to go through those hoops and there will be conditions for that assistance . 
  after assessments and negotiations the conditions may be different , but there 's no avoiding them when asking for esm assistance . 
   have they been implemented yet in any country ? 
  yes , spain and cyprus . 
  esm has [ five different instruments ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism#financial_support_instruments ) for providing financial assitance . 
  see details about the esm programmes and instruments used for spain and cyprus here : http://www.esm.europa.eu/assistance/index.htm  i was under the impression that these were loans to these countries at lower rates than they could get on the bond markets , but came with strict conditions . 
  yes , that has been the general idea but objectives , implementations and conditions vary between the five different esm instruments . 
  for example a * bank recapitalisation programme * is different from say * stability support loan within a macro-economic adjustment programme * or * precautionary financial assistance * . 
   were any of the previous loans disbersed to these countries one of the three options you mentioned above ? 
  so far only spain and cyprus have asked for and gotten esm assistance . 
  that 's because the esm is a shiny new facility . 
  the earlier packages to crisis countries were constructed through bilateral loans , [ efsm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stabilisation_mechanism ) , and [ efsf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stability_facility ) , which were temporary mechanisms to provide financial stability to the ez ( and inadequate ) . 
  since may 2013 the only mechanism to finance new financial assistance programmes is the new esm . 
  decades ago it used to be a huge factor in finland too . 
  but ever since the education reform started in the '70s with egality as basic principle it has been a lesser and lesser factor , and based on pisa and other results the students score well even despite their socioeconomic status . 
  yet that factor does exist , and in recent years it has grown a bit which has been raising some [ alarm ] ( http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/tuhoutuuko-suomalainen-peruskoulu ) over here . 
   while looking for pisa assessments , i remember reading one that tried to evaluated usa schools with roughly the same level of poverty than finland , and the results were very good , even better iirc . 
  i guess you mean like [ this infographic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hqncyyy ) which is based on this rather incomplete [ analysis ] ( http://nasspblogs.org/principaldifference/2010/12/pisa_its_poverty_not_stupid_1.html ) .
