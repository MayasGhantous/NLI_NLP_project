  it makes a flawed comparison by first picking and choosing only a subset of pisa scores ( reading ) . 
  then chooses subsets of us scores by the rate of free and reduced lunch in us schools . 
  the analysis then names the rate of free and reduced lunch in us schools as their poverty rate , and moves on to a series of misleading comparisons with whole countries by their actual poverty rates . 
  some problems with that approach : 1 . 
  of pisa scores only reading is chosen with no explanation why , and why math and science scores were excluded . 
  there 's no consideration nor explanation why `` the rate of free and reduced lunch '' in us schools would be comparable with poverty rates in other whole countries . 
  choosing arbitrary subsets of us scores and comparing them to whole countries is not a good comparison . 
  whatever criteria one applies to pick subsets it should also be used with other countries if one hopes to have comparable subsets . 
  btw , here in finland `` the rate of free and reduced lunch '' is actually 100 % : http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12shpa/the_quality_of_everyday_free_school_lunch_if/ every pupil gets a free school lunch , and it 's recognized that eating well is good for brain and learning . 
  so perhaps that comparison has also the amount and quality of school lunches as one significant factor at play in the differences of the chosen us scores . 
  got ta love the vowels : * [ riiuuy\u00f6aie ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/riiuuy%c3%b6aie ) *, 
   we are fully aware of how much our north-western neighbours hate us . 
  generally we do n't hate you russians or russia . 
  of course you 'll find some people with such sentiments which they base on past events , yet hate is not the general sentiment nowadays . 
  but finns , among others , are wary about the russia and its sometimes quite erratic and random behavior . 
  yeah , based on what i 've read sweden 's reforms have been generally successful at delivering improved access and improved productivity in health care . 
  finland is currently planning profound reforms and our national institute for health and welfare is going to recommend to learn from some experiences in sweden and denmark - especially in implementing workable freedom of choice . 
   what does this support look like ? 
  the only mechanism to finance new financial assistance programmes is [ esm ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/ ) . 
  in the case of probable further financial assitance to portugal , and to help portugal 's return to the loan market , the possible esm instruments for a new program would be : stability support loan within a macro-economic adjustment programme ( sovereign bailout loan ) primary market support facility ( pmsf ) secondary market support facility ( smsf ) these all will come with conditions . 
  if a country applies for a new assistance program a new memorandum of understanding is needed and a new financial assistance facility agreement will be signed . 
  the european commission , ecb and ( whenever possible ) imf will assess the financing needs of the country , sustainability of its debt , and will negotiate with the country the conditions of the assistance . 
   european institutions just forked over a grip of cash to greece , how many countries can it keep on life support ? 
  esm will have $ 500 bn for the assistance programs . 
  it will be enough to cover possible new programs for portugal , spain , ireland , greece and cyprus for some years to come if such is needed . 
  it probably would n't be enough to cover for example a complete bailout of italy but that 's unlikely scenario anyway as even silvio can not really fuck up that much . 
   if you are `` completely reliant '' on those institutions , what happens when these institutions fail to deliver these external fundings ? 
  it 's unlikely that esm would fail to deliver funding as it likely has enough funds , but there 's also the political aspects to consider : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism#critics, 
  i feel some pride that also my countrymen were there in 1877-78 kicking ottoman ass for bulgaria 's freedom . 
  finnish guard sharpshooter battalion 's fist battle was the [ battle of gorni dubnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_gorni_dubnik ) , and later they were also in tashkessen , shipka pass and philippopolis . 
  when they marched back to helsinki they sang this : http://youtu.be/gztgznljqw4 it stuck as their unit march , and their follower unit still sings about gorni dubnik . 
  in kosher the animal must be ` immaculate ' i.e. 
  not even stunned before slitting its throat . 
  halal requires only that the animal is alive before butchering ( doh ! ) . 
  so stunning prior to slitting animal 's throat is acceptable , and indeed widely practiced in many countries . 
  for example in malaysian `` halal rules '' animal can be stunned with electrical , mechanical or pneumatic stunner . 
  you can find some muslims who for some reason oppose stunning for example by claiming that the stunning kills the animal , or that the stunning itself causes more suffering to the animal especially in case of electricity . 
  but the fact is that ` not stunned ' is not a requirement for halal , and in denmark and finland muslims butcher stunned animals just as the local animal welfare laws require . 
  because almost everybody already knows that the insurance file is in the internet . 
  indeed . 
  luckily the majority of my countrymen do recognize the need of structural reforms and cuts , and supports making them : [ yle survey : finns are ready for structural reforms ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/yle_survey_finns_are_ready_for_structural_reforms/6782661 ) perhaps they still remember the devastating recession of early '90s . 
  but whatever the reason , sounds like common sense to me . 
  finland has structural and competitiveness problems that do need addressing both in short and long term if we are to still make a living with exports and to keep the nordic welfare model . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's a viable solution alone , but could possibly play some part in the likely third bailout package . 
  there 's also some other eu funding that was introduced to the next 2014-2020 mff with the crisis countries in mind , but wo n't cover a bailout . 
  if eu structural funding is increased specifically for greece then one important question is : can greece absorb it timely and effectively enough for it to be helpful ? 
  through its membership greece has been a net beneficiary of eu funds , and has annually received billions of structural funding from ` sustainable growth ' . 
  but take a look at this [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jb5okba ) ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) ) see that huge drop when the crisis hit ? 
  in other crisis countries there was n't such huge drop . 
  that 's mostly because in greece there was less projects seeking eu funding , and the main reason is that projects could not secure the needed investments or loans as you need part of your project 's funding from elsewhere - a problem of domestic financing . 
  before one can expect a significant rise in greece 's ability to actually absorb increased structural funding , both domestic financing and especially investment enviroment needs to be working well . 
  just throwing more money at the problem is not the solution . 
   seriously ? 
  yes . 
  dissolving monopolies and privatizations were beneficial to the consumers . 
   we 're lucky that the eu has decided to make maximum prices , otherwise we would be paying more than 5 times as much . 
  that is not a matter of privatization , it 's a matter of market regulation . 
   or rather , warm lights at the moment ? 
  oh yes , still warm lights here in northern finland where i 'm hunting wild [ vaccinium myrtillus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccinium_myrtillus ) . 
   but why should the greek people suffer for the mishaps of the banks ? 
  and if those banks were n't saved with the $ 50bn from other countries presumably you 'd ask the very same question times two . 
   really , the privatisation of public assets and other neoliberal policies did n't bring anything good . 
  just for one example dissolving tele monopolies and privatizing has been very beneficial to consumers in finland in the form of better services at lower prices . 
  in the '90s finland was among the first european countries to do it , and honestly i do n't miss the services before a bit . 
   otoh , the privatise everything has been a roaring success . 
  good that there 's a vast middle ground between ` privatize nothing ' and ` privatize everything ' . 
  a very good and concise analysis . 
  thanks for posting this . 
  so far greek banks have already received recapitalization about $ 40.9 billion out of an allocated $ 50 billion . 
  and greece 's interest rates are kept very low indeed . 
  in the case of the eurozone 's bilateral loans for the first greek bailout the interest is about 1.5 % which is even * below * most eurozone countries ' borrowing costs . 
  and as for the second bailout 's efsf loans the interests are at cost . 
   the privatisation of public assets across the continent is destroying the european social model . 
  die linke would protect it over here we privatize whatever we see fit and whenever we think it to be beneficial . 
  sometimes it 's successful and sometimes less so , but we do it on our own accord , and we absolutely have to work on structural reforms and on our competitiveness . 
  not in any way have we ever done it on angela merkel 's consultation , nor has she offered any or have we needed such . 
  and despite the challenges of globalization evidently finland still can into nordic welfare model - without any ` protection ' schemes by die linke . 
   defeating current and future waves of privatisation must be at the heart of any efforts to re-establish the primacy of the citizen within a democratic europe . 
  this is how we can offer an alternative to merkel 's rotten vision for the future of the continent . 
  next month , the german electorate can strike a blow for all europeans . 
  linke pls . 
  that 's how butchering mammals is also done in finland . 
  [ according to the law ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1996/en19960396 ) the animal has to be unconscious when its throat is slit . 
  regarding animal welfare as long as the law is observed its inconsequential what magic words the butcher mumbles if any . 
  in halal it 's acceptable to stun the animal first and then slit its throat . 
  which is how the slaughtering is commonly done anyway . 
  so from animal welfare point of view there 's no difference . 
  and as an additional requirement it 's mandatory to have a veterinary officer present when doing a ` slaughtering method applied for religious reasons ' . 
  the requirement of stunning is also the reason why it 's not practical to do kosher butchering in finland without breaking the animal welfare law . 
  yet to try and accommodate the wishes of jewish community a compromise was made in the law :  notwithstanding the provisions set down in section 42 ( 1 ) above concerning the stunning of an animal before bleeding , ** if required by religious reasons bleeding may be started simultaneously with stunning ** , in compliance with the provisions of this chapter . 
  so if one was to do kosher butchering it would be possible at least in theory if one invented a safe method of * simultaneously * stunning and bleeding the animal and the jewish community would accept that as kosher . 
  personally , even as i am an ignosticisist , when i lived in metropolitan helsinki i preferred the halal butcher 's shops over supermarkets because : 1 . 
  better quality and better service with reasonable prices . 
  from animal welfare point of view halal has a bit stricter controls than regular industrial butchering , the butcher gets to be picky when choosing animals , and the butcher spends time to calm the animals after their often stressful journey to the slaughterhouse . 
  i always try to prefer small local shops over area supermarkets .
