   greece is el from ell\u00e0da right ? 
  right . 
   how is poland such a huge net gainer ? 
  new member , big country , big agriculture , and especially big post-communism rebuilding - see the cohesion funding [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kdf7ixg ) . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) )  i always thought we ( belgium ) were a net gainer . 
  not that it was really advantageous for us but because of all the institutions in brussels and it 's surroundings . 
  belgium is a net beneficiary when the administration expenditure of those institutions is included . 
   the european countries being compared against are smaller than many single states in america . 
  it 's the other way round . 
  germany : 81 million france : 65 million uk : 63 million spain : 47 million ( total 256 million ) whereas california : 38 million texas : 26 million new york : 20 million florida : 19 million etc. . . ( total 313 million ), 
  the sovjet union did n't actually request that bombing raid , but the brits executed it as a demonstration of support to their new ally su . 
  the purpose of the raid by the british fleet air arm was to bomb german shipping which they believed to be in the harbours of liinahamari ( finland ) and kirkenes ( norway ) . 
  one of the failures of the attack was that there were n't german ships to bomb . 
  so for example in liinahamari the brits managed to sink just one norwegian merchant ship with rum as cargo with losses of three aircraft destroyed and seven damaged . 
  the whole ` operation er ' was pretty much a disaster from the start , low chances of having a surprise night attack in an area with 24h of daylight . 
  perhaps they had relied on sovjet military intelligence which was pretty crappy in wwii . 
  at the time finland and uk were not at war . 
  only about four months later churchill decared war on finland - he did it a bit reluctantly obliging to sovjet demands . 
  other commonwealth countries australia , canada and new zealand followed . 
  the one-off bombing raid to liinahamari remained the only british attack against finland in wwii . 
  was not that big deal anyway , though had an effect on public opinion at the time . 
  and churchill was n't too happy about it . 
  * `` i am deeply grieved at what i see coming , namely that we shall be forced in a few days out of loyalty to our ally russia to declare a war upon finland . 
  '' * his letter to mannerheim over here : http://www.reddit.com/r/finland/comments/1kkwdd/us_and_finland_in_wwii/ just an unnecessary nitpick but also australia , canada and new zealand were democracies . 
  not only low cost loans . 
  ever since 1981 greece has been a net beneficiary from the eu budget receiving billions of support every year . 
  for example here 's [ years 2000-2011 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/wel/images/financialreport/en/annex3_1_en.png ), 
  * `` you 've had your debate . 
  there 's no need to write any more . 
   residents of a village called butale ( idiotville ) . 
  they once got into a fight with common sense and won . 
  we have such folk stories too . 
  i think they 're traditional all over europe . 
  the finnish village is called h\u00f6lm\u00f6l\u00e4 ( idiotville ) and its inhabitants are very honest and hard working idiots . 
  one of them ( matti ) is smart but gets sometimes regarded as the village idiot by others because they can not comprehend his ideas . 
  in one story they built a house . 
  but to their huge disappointment it was dark inside . 
  after pondering the problem they came to conclusion that the darkness is because of lack of light inside . 
  and there 's plenty of light outside . 
  so they took these big sacks and started running back and forth carrying light . 
  matti came by and asked what 's up . 
  after hearing the problem he took a big axe and to other 's astonishment hacked a small hole in the wall - a window as he called it . 
  now there was light in the house . 
  but it was still far too dim for their taste , so the villagers all grabbed axes and hacked some more . 
  after hacking down three walls the house collapsed . 
  which was kinda bummer for everybody . 
  until they realized the silver lining - now they have just as much light as outside .

  for finland it 's maiden of finland or suomi-neito . 
  she 's most often depicted as a young blonde woman with blue eyes dressed in a national costume . 
  she became popular as a national symbol in the 19th century during the russian rule . 
  in the famous painting ` attack ' from 1899 suomi-neito and her laws are assaulted by [ russification ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_finland ) : [ attack ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wj2tr3e ) suomi-neito is also a reference to the shape of the country . 
  before stalin annexed parts in wwii finland sort of had a head , two arms and a skirt : [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r9op3mg ) i kinda like these [ cutesly japanese depictions ] ( http://www.finland.or.jp/public/default.aspx?contentid=243207&amp;nodeid=41206&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ) of her . 
  well , for anyone to assess that issue as a first step you could provide the imf paper in question . 
  trade . 
  no free monies or financial aid there either . 
  the clearing-trade with the su was an important part of finland 's foreign trade ( at its peak about 15 % of exports in the '80s ) . 
  yet it was trading with stuff : finland exports so and so many items of clothing , rolls of paper , icebrakers or locomotives , and sovjet union pays with oil , cheap ladas , or other stuff . 
  no monies were changing hands , and the amount of imports and exports was agreed to be equal . 
  the problem was that the su had little high quality stuff to export , yet they wanted more and more high quality industrial products from finland . 
  so a growing trade deficit appeared and when the su dissolved they owed a lot of money , which debt russia paid off by 2006 with money , stuff and services ( i think they still owe us a couple of space launches ) . 
   it 's more or less inevitable and we 'll just have to deal with it . 
  and has both good and bad sides - for both of us . 
  well for example finland did not get aid through the marshall plan , not that the us would n't have given or we would n't have taken but could n't because of sovjet union . 
  and instead of getting marshall aid finland had to pay war reparations which were a huge burden on economy , and were paid to the penny as the only country in the world . 
  still after the wwii finland transformed itself from an agrarian economy into industrial one , and build a nordic welfare model on top of that during the '60s - '80s . 
  only in '30s children were sold in goddamn auctions in finland , and now the education system gets praised round the world . 
  it 's not about being lucky and getting loads of free monies . 
  it 's about getting shit done .

  * according to recent survey [ finns are ready for structural reforms ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/yle_survey_finns_are_ready_for_structural_reforms/6782661 ) . 
  the most popular potential reforms were changing the social security payments system , keeping the salary rises below 1 % , and raising the retirement age . 
  most opposed were cutting student grants , reducing child homecare aid , and decreasing housing allowances . 
  happy to hear their job would be that bit easier than thought the political parties hailed the good sense of finns . 
  * [ in another survey ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/poll_centre_and_sdp_most_popular_pair_to_head_next_cabinet/6782080 ) 66 % of finns are good with the current government coalition remaining in office until the next scheduled parliamentary election in 2015 . 
  yet for the next government a center-left coalition of social democrat party ( now governing ) and centre party ( now in opposition ) was the most popular choise with 23 % support .

   well , maybe . 
  you 'll notice there 's an overall trend , pretty much everywhere . 
  recently in the baltic countries the homicide rates have been dropping at much faster pace than the general eu trend .
