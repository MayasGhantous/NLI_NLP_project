  yes , there has been a long term declining trend in crime rates and violent crime in pretty much everywhere in the western world . 
  criminologists and sociologists have proposed multiple explanating factors for the phenomenom from changing demographics ( less youngsters ) and economical factors ( less poverty ) to better social mobility etc. 
  iirc someone even proposed ledless fuel ( the less lead in the enviroment , the less brain damage and aggressive behavior ) . 
  typically the victims are not random people on the street but alcoholics or their associates . 
  so unless you plan to become an alcoholic or an associate your risk of becoming a victim is very low . 
   why do you think that is ? 
  homicide in finland is indeed peculiar compared to other nordics . 
  in finland about 75-85 % of all homicides are related to alcoholism , and are typically committed by a drunk , low educated , middle-aged , unemployed alcoholic who assaults his associate in a drinking group . 
  but in sweden only little over half of homicides are related to alcohol . 
  there is no simple answer as to why that is . 
  this paper gives some pointers to the various factors that might be at play : [ alcohol as a causal criminogenic factor : the scandinavian experience . 
  ] ( http://www.rpkab.se/alcoholandcrime.htm ) another difference is that the rate of violent crime is actually lower in finland than in sweden . 
   but not sure that explains it , if i remember copenhagen on weekends , the swedes do not have less of that problem and are much lower on the statistics ( and yes , meant copenhagen in danmark and swedes ) . 
  some swedes go to copenhagen to drink on weekends . 
  so it obviously is a subgroup of swedes in a specific circumstances , and not a good basis for making general comparisons to whole finland . 
  if we [ compare the cities ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kimp9/eu_homicide_rate_per_100_000_population/cbperxu ) during 2006-2010 the homicide rates in copenhagen ( 1.6 ) and in helsinki ( 1.7 ) were not much different . 
  in 2012 there were 89 homicides in finland with a rate of 1.6 , and they are on a long term declining trend . 
  about 18 % of homicides are commited with firearms the most common weapon being knife . 
  mrpeachy is correct , the homicide rate in finland is closely related to alcoholism . 
  but that does not mean that the finns are violent , murderous alcoholics . 
  what we have in those numbers is a subgroup overrepresented . 
  a typical finnish homicide is committed by a drunk , low educated , middle-aged , unemployed alcoholic who assaults his associate in a drinking group . 
  these cases represent over 75 % of all homicides in finland , and most of them happen in economically poorer eastern and northern provinces . 
   probably ~ 1/30 of the prisoners are in for homicide ? 
  sentences for homicide are longer compared to many other crimes so also the related share of prisoners is a lot higher . 
  may 2013 there were 2699 prisoners ( or [ criminal sanctions clients ] ( http://www.rikosseuraamus.fi/62445.htm ) as the agency puts it ) . 
  of those 621 were convicted for homicide and their share was 23 % of all prisoners . 
  however if one looks at it on a yearly basis your estimate gets much closer : in a year how many of those convicted to a prison sentence are for homicide ? 
  then the answer is 0.7 % of all prison sentences in a year . 
   i do understand that there still is a very high number of people who suffer from depression and high suicide and alcoholism rates , despite good public services and ranking high on happiest country indexes . 
  can anyone explain this ? 
  is it the long winters ? 
  i do n't have an explanation . 
  reasons for someone commiting suicide or becoming an alcoholic are variable and complex and i do n't believe there exists a single simple explanation . 
  but here 's some numbers . 
  the suicide rate in finland has been on a declining trend for decades and is lowest in over 40 years ( [ see stats ] ( http://stat.fi/til/ksyyt/2011/ksyyt_2011_2012-12-21_kat_006_en.html ) ) . 
  in 2011 the rate was 16.1 which is about 1.6 times the eu average of 10.2 , about 6th highest in the eu , and about 20th highest in world . 
  it 's still higher than the eu average , but not exceptionally high and is declining . 
  the alcohol consumption in finland is below eu average , and according to the data finns are generally not heavy drinkers compared to other eu countries . 
  yet some finns do drink hard : about 10 % of finns consume about 50 % of all alcohol . 
  i do not know the rate of alcoholism in finland or in the eu for comparison , but one could safely say that some of those 10 % are alcoholics . 
  in 2011 alcohol related diseases and accidental poisoning by alcohol were the 6th common cause of death with 3.7 % of all deaths . 
  alcohol mortality has been on a decline yet is still the leading cause of death among the subgroup of working age men . 
  both issues you mentioned are problems but not as big as one often hears , and are declining . 
  i think the accessibility of intervention and treatment services is crucial in alleviating those . 
  one big problem is that alcoholism bears a heavy social stigma here , and that may lead problem drinkers to deny and to hide their problem rather than to seek support and help to address it . 
  those were the days my friend . 
   a french president ( chirac ) said finland you know nothing french president chirac . 
  i for one would love to be a mongol with the superior riding and horse archery skills . 
  so do you know how many ? 
  honestly would like to know as that was my question . 
  thanks , i 'll have a look at those . 
  that blog post was simplistic at best to the point of being silly . 
  for general critique of finnish education system your best sources would be us educators ( yeah , i am ) and related studies and publications . 
  a very good starting point would be [ oph ] ( http://www.oph.fi/english ) . 
  just to add : we never planned to have a system for ` the best education system in the world ' , whatever that means . 
  we planned for * egality * , nutrition , having breaks , safe enviroment , etc. . . 
  i do n't know if you grasp the huge social change that happened here , or how to explain that process and all the hard work that was done to do it , but as a poignant example : as recently as '30s poor children were sold in auctions in finland . 
  we do invest quite a lot in education for good reasons . 
  but it never was the plan to be ` the best in the world ' like there was a competition about it . 
  honestly we were pretty much surprised how well finland has been ranked , and to a finn such ranking feels even a bit embarassing as it was a complete surprise . 
  edit2 : there is no secret sauce into it . 
  we 've been doing well because we 've been serious about it for very long time . 
  i actually hate it when finland gets touted as ` the best ' . 
  there 's plenty to improve . 
  and now that we 're there on the top it suddenly turns into a competition to keep that position . 
  which is detrimental . 
  i honestly hope we drop from top 10 and no-one pays us attention any more , and we can continue to do our thing in peace without ridiculous rankings like that blog post . 
  i 'm good at my job , but it does feel kinda bad when it gets internationally downplayed by '' a professor of mathematics at a wisconsin university ' who knows absolutely nothing about it with his olden genious ability of doing freaking irrelevant fractions . 
  if finland drops from top ten , then everyone else can go ` ha ha ' , and that 's much better position - as over here we can once again concentrate on to just doing our thing instead of pointless explaining . 
  so please do it , world . 
  please drop us from top 10 . 
  we 'd all be better if you did . 
  do it . 
  that was a heartwarming rendition . 
   i too would be interested in explanation/critique . 
  simple critique of simplistic blog post : who the hell emphasizes learning fractions in a * decimal * number system . 
  if that is still so relevant to north americans with their archaic measures ( ' a professor of mathematics at a wisconsin university ' ) then by all means have it . 
  i 'll never do the `` basic math '' of calculating with 5 feet + 6 and 59\u204464 inches . 
  but i can easily say how many meters is 170 centimeters . 
  if not doing as well as americans in fractions is detrimental to my education then by all means , as they * need * to do it a lot and spend time learning them . 
  yet in a decimal system those are not that important anyway and that effort can be spent learning something else more useful . 
  might as well measure how well pupils do with binary or hexadecimal , those would be more relevant in modern world . 
  metal you say ? 
  i 'll just leave this here if you happen to be into helismaa-metal : [ viikate - sysi\u00e4ss\u00e4 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqwxi__rs0 ), 
   and the word around the campfire is that a spot on the criminal record ai n't the best thing in the world when looking for a job . 
  are you sure mere deporting would be put into his * criminal * record ? 
  surely a violation of immigration laws will be recorded by the country where the offence was noted and deportation took place , but i do n't think it will open or extend actual criminal record in the home country . 
  for example if i overstayed in the us and got deported it would not make me a criminal in finland nor would it get recorded to my criminal record in finland . 
  it would be recorded by the us , and likely i 'd be a persona non over grata there for some time . 
  hey , if you guys travel this way at some point i might be able to help with accomodation from couch in southern finland to cottage in the lapland wilderness . 
  pm me if you happen to come this way , and i 'll answer if i happen to still read reddit by then . 
  knowing the everyman 's rights makes such traveling , camping , and enjoying outdoors and nature easy over here . 
  just bewarned : like all nordics finland is pricey . 
   mika waltari and his super thick historical novels happy to hear you know him !, 
  his books are treasures . 
  having red some of his novels is generally considered part of basic civilization over here ( * sinuhe , egyptil\u00e4inen * being the most popular must read ) . 
  my personal favs : [ mikael karvajalka & mikael hakim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_adventurer_%28novel%29 ) [ johannes angelos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dark_angel_%28waltari%29 ) [ sinuhe , egyptil\u00e4inen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_egyptian ) [ turms kuolematon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_etruscan )  oh !, 
  also his children - and detective stories are enjoyable . 
  some of his * komisario palmu * detective stories were filmed in early '60s .
