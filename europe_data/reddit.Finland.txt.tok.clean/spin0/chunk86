  the movies are actually quite good and finnish classics ( except the crappy last one ) . 
  my fav one : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054001/ also michael curtiz and darryl f. zanuck made [ a spectacle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_egyptian_%28film%29 ) based on the historical novel * sinuhe , egyptil\u00e4inen * , but you know hollywood ... 
  despite the movie ( or because of it ) mika waltari 's * the egyptian * remained the most sold foreign novel in the us until umberto eco 's ` the name of the rose ' surpassed it in the '80s . 
  it was very sad news indeed . 
  he was a great player , and i best remember rachunek by that goal . 
  rip yeah , floorball is popular in finland , but not big as hockey . 
  certainly a floorball trick there but i do n't know if granlund had played also floorball , possibly . 
   it is a pretty stupid and disgusting subreddit .

  my song of the now is leningrad cowboys and the red army ensemble [ happy together ] ( http://youtu.be/ghb4q6hsxei?t=14m25s ) in helsinki 1993 . 
  because this thread made me a bit nostalgic : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1k0rlt/series_what_do_you_know_about_finland/cbk6wcq, 
   leningrad cowboys man , never forget their first total balalaika show with the red army choir in helsinki senate square 1993 . 
  that was truly epic . 
  the sovjet union had previously collapsed and it was time to loosen the tensions , have fun , rock on and celebrate [ happy together ] ( http://youtu.be/ghb4q6hsxei?t=14m25s ) . 
  the senate square was packed full with 70 000 spectators . 
  in the crowd i met two little old grannies , ` what are you guys doing here ' ? 
  * `` well the last time the red army visited they were dropping bombs on us . 
  of course we had to come and see \\ _ this \\ _ !, 
  yes , a lot , but not exactly swamps . 
  depending on definition about 26-29 % of land area is peatlands , bogs and such . 
  almost one-third of the eu peatland is in finland ( and 6th largest area in the world ) . 
  it 's beause of their very different ages . 
  in finland the * tunturis * are about 1.8-1 .9 bn years old . 
  they have gone through many ice ages and whatnot . 
  the mountain range scandes formed about 400 mn years ago , so the mountains have n't experienced as much erosion . 
  yet they used to be much higher too . 
  yes , it does exclude those . 
  hence i was interested in knowing how many of that age group actually are in the labour market in the first place . 
  if , say , 50 % of the age group is in the labour market and 64.9 % of them are unemployed , then about 32 % of the whole age group would be unemployed .

  [ the article ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0d91deb8-fb6c-11e2-8650-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2b19kvzct ) does not say there would n't be growth , it says there are some positive signs and growth is expected but it may be too slow to have much effect on the high unemployment rate in the near/med future - unless changes in the labour market . 
   however , echoing recent warnings from independent economists , the imf makes clear that spain 's growth rates in the years ahead will be too anaemic to allow job creation . 
  the fund expects spain 's gross domestic product rise to be less than 1 per cent annually for the next four years , and only 1.2 per cent in 2018 . 
  `` spain has historically never generated net employment when the economy grew less than 1.5-2 per cent , '' the imf notes . 
  `` yet growth is not projected to reach these rates even in the medium-term . 
  thus reducing unemployment to its structural level ( still likely very high around 18 per cent ) by the end of the decade would require a significant improvement in labour market dynamics . '', 
  yeah , but then again how many of that age group are in the labour market and not at school ? 
  mynd you , m\u00f8\u00f8se bites kan be pretty nasti ... 
   we entered the iwc on the understanding that it would regulate whaling . 
  when it turned out it had no intention to do so we left . 
  actually it was the iwc 's idea of `` regulating '' that originally led to the collapse of the whale populations and the whaling . 
  this happened very quickly and took only some decades to do after wwii , as great whales are very slow to reproduce . 
  in the iwc the whaling nations consistently set their quotas too high and then exceeded even those . 
  and when one species of great whales had been hunted down to the brink of extinction ( some were ) the industry moved to destroy another species under the iwc `` regulation '' . 
  and in the ' 70-80s after all species of great whales had already collapsed , the heavily subsidised whaling industry had to move to less profitable smaller species such as mink whales . 
  yet even in the '80s when the iwc actually started regulating the whaling nations continued killing the rarer and rarer great whales . 
  so * evidently * iwc 's regulating did not work and had not worked , whole species had collapsed , industries had collapsed , and those nations that still continued whaling could only do so with heavy public subsidies - not sane . 
  the enviromentalists did n't kill whaling , the whaling industry and its regulatory organ did by not regulating . 
  hence the ban . 
   the little we to hunt is mostly not endengared and completely sustainable and if the iwc wo n't regulate that hunting we 'll just do it ourselfs , we did give them decades before we gave up . 
  iceland ( or more accurately the only company that does whaling in iceland ) has once again moved on to kill endangered great whales . 
  that 's because great whales are bigger catch and more profitable to kill than small mink whales . 
  despite the global ban they have killed more and more year after year . 
  and the meat is n't even consumed in iceland . 
  there 's actually surplus of it in iceland ( [ years-old whale meat remains unsold ] ( http://grapevine.is/news/readarticle/years-old-whale-meat-remains-unsold ) ) . 
  it gets exported to japan despite the ban of international trade of endangered species . 
  japan does kill some fin whales under the auspices of ` scientific ' whaling , but a lot less than iceland kills . 
  funny thing is that because the demand for whale meat is so low even in japan the market is saturated and japan already has thousands of tons of fin whale meat in deep freeze . 
  they even feed the endangered species to dogs as people consume so little . 
  yet iceland ( or more accurately that loftsson guy ) kills even more of those great whales only to export the meat into japan . 
   a flat-out global ban in the face of scientific data showing sustainable hunt is possible is n't accepteble . 
  the ban was the only thing left to do as iwc 's `` regulation '' had so spectacularly failed . 
  and whaling does not even make much economic sense as it needs subsidies . 
  even in japan it 's whale watching , not whaling , that turns actual profit . 
   practically everybody in iceland supports whaling and there are a couple of reasons for that . 
  interestingly that 's not what i read : [ whalers and watchers battle in iceland ] ( http://mg.co.za/article/2011-07-20-whalers-and-watchers-battle-in-iceland ) whale watching and whale tourism has been one of the most rapidly growing sectors of tourism during the last decade and is already worth billions globally . 
   and whales are just delicious !, 
  they taste quite similar to beef , with a finer texture . 
  yet that 's not a very good argument to [ kill endangered species ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fin_whale#human_interaction ) for export to japan with government subsidies despite the global ban of international trade of endangered species , to turn them into [ dog food ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/19/iceland-fin-whale-hunting-greenpeace ) as the demand for the meat is [ too low ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/news/iceland-broke-japanese-whale-meat-230537748.html ) even in the japanese market , and to undermine global efforts to conserve them . 
  i do believe that iceland could hunt mink whales sustainably for their own consumption , but it 's ironic that the meat in iceland is served to curious tourists as a traditional local dish , while only very few icelanders themselves ( 5 % ) eat it regularly . 
  apparently the whaling industry depends on tourists eating the whales to the extent that they demanded the removal of ads with slogan [ `` meet us do n't eat us '' ] ( http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/whales/meet-us-don%e2%80%99t-eat-us-campaign-take-whale-meat-menu-tourists ) from keflavik international airport . 
   idiot is defined as a stupid person . 
  i believe somebody who ignores the right to self-determination of a people fully fits this description . 
  that 's not a personal attack , that 's an analysis of what somebody has said and then passing a judgement on that . 
  well , it actually is a personal attack . 
  only if you limited your analysis and judgement to the sayings only then it would not be . 
  the distinction being : 1 . 
  * `` what you said is idiotic '' * is not a personal attack . 
  neither is * `` your opinion is stupid '' * . 
  they may not be good arguments or good form , but they 're not personal attacks as it 's the posts and opinions that are judged upon - not the poster personally . 
  * `` you 're an idiot for what you said '' * or * `` you 're stupid '' * are personal attacks as the target is the person . 
  well they both disregard international whaling commision , do commercial whaling despite the global ban , and hunt endangered species . 
  iceland hunts endangered fin whales : [ iceland resumes fin whale hunting after two-year break ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/19/iceland-fin-whale-hunting-greenpeace )  loftsson 's company hvalur plans to hunt up to 180 fin whales in the 2013 season . 
  the international whaling commission has banned commercial whaling but its authority is not recognised by iceland . 
  more than 1 million people from around the world signed a recent online petition against the trading of icelandic fin whale meat amid revelations that some of it has ended up in ** dog food products in japan . 
  there is indeed a hard problems to solve in materials . 
  yet some solutions have been surprisingly simple , hence the need of coconuts to build iter .
