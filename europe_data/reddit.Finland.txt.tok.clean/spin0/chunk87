  no , not a monty python joke , the most efficient coating material for the cryopanels that keep the vacuum in the iter tokamak clean : [ coconut-shell charcoal ] ( http://www.iter.org/sci/beyonditer ) . 
  ignition is not the breakthrough here , as other tokamak 's have already done that , it 's achieving the breakeven point and producing more power than the input . 
  for example the [ joint european torus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_european_torus ) ( jet ) achieved world 's first controlled release of fusion power already in 1991 , and later produced 16 mw of fusion power with input of 24 mw ( 65 % ) . 
  iter will go beyond that producing 500 mw output with 50 mw input . 
  the science news article is about american [ national ignition facility ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_ignition_facility ) , which is not a tokamak but a different beast . 
  finland is not going to join in the near future , but never say never . 
  nato membership may not be seen as best option currently but that may change in the long run as the world and our neighbourhood changes . 
  as president niinist\u00f6 says , it 's better to keep that option open . 
   especially when many countries in europe require you to carry a passport at all times ( e.g. 
  germany ) . 
  for eu citizens from a country belonging to the schengen area no passport is required - a valid national id card is sufficient . 
  see : http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm, 
  in many tables also candidate countries are included , but not the potential candidate countries . 
  in case of macedonia and serbia i think it 's due to lack of data , as they are included in many other tables as candidate countries . 
  here 's the full publication : [ european social statistics - 2013 edition ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=ks-fp-13-001 ), 
   do the percentages also include illegal immigrants ? 
  but according to estimates their share would be small in such comparison ( yet varying by country ) , and has been in decline since 2002 both in absolute numbers and share of population . 
  [ table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2rfbujh ) ( [ source ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/tcmirregularmigration.pdf ) ) and in 2012 the number of people trying to illegally enter the eu dropped by nearly half from 2011 : http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424127887324763404578430720376545106.html, 
  could you provide a link to a breakdown of sweden 's contributions ? 
  are you sure that the $ 11 bn is actual loans and not guarantees ? 
  only a small amount is actual loans ( 1.3 bn ) . 
  most have been guarantees , payments and commitments to funding mechanisms , and support by bank of finland . 
   possibly , but the greek government being debt-free would n't change the composition of the greek economy . 
  and since it is dependent on tourism and shipping , it could have gotten hit even harder if the global economic climate were any worse than it is now . 
  indeed . 
  the greek government even did their calculations about the case of greek default . 
  the numbers showed that it would not be beneficial because of the structure of their economy . 
  hence they decided to ask imf and ez help . 
  yeah , somewhat i 'd guess , but they mostly rant on about muslims with copypasta from stormfront , gates of vienna and such . 
  common rants about russians seem to be ` dey turk err jurbs ' and ` dey buy err summercottages ' . 
  years ago there were lot of talk and fears about russian criminals invading finland en masse but did n't happen . 
  that is the case at least here in finland where immigration is low and by far the most immigrants are from neighbouring countries russia and estonia . 
  biggest five foreign native languages in finland are : russian 62 554 estonian 38 364 somali 14 769 english 14 666 arabia 12 042, 
  russia is in the region ` europe ' because most of russia 's population is within geographical europe . 
  as censuses and numbers are provided by country it makes more sense to include russia in the region ` europe ' rather than ` asia-pacific ' . 
  but you can use the data to make further breakdowns excluding russia and including for example only eu28 . 
  well their respective shares are even smaller . 
  the right side is ` foreign citizens ' , i.e. 
  persons who have foreign citizenship some of whom have been born in finland and most born abroad . 
  among those two groups you find about 183 000 persons with native language other than finnish , swedish or sami . 
  and of the other native languages in finland by far the biggest are russian and estonian . 
  the left side is ` finnish citizens ' . 
  of those obviously by far the most have been born in finland , and then some abroad ( 108 585 ) which number also includes those with finnish parent ( s ) . 
  of those born abroad about 60 000 have native language other than finnish , swedish or sami . 
  most of naturalized foreign born immigrants are in that group . 
  during 2000-2012 on average about 4900 foreign born persons per year got finnish citizenship , by far most of them russians . 
  tl ; dr the share of immigrants in finland is small - even if you account for naturalized persons who have gotten citizenship . 
  for such discussion this study is better source : http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-europe/ in 2010 about 6 % of europe 's population were muslims ( here the numbers include also the whole russia with largest population of muslims among the countries ) . 
  considering immigration and newborns the share of muslims will somewhat grow but slowly : in 2030 about 8 % would be muslims . 
  at that rate muslims would be the majority only after 400 years . 
  in western europe the share is even smaller , in 2010 about 4.5 % and projected to grow to 7.5 % by 2030 . 
  that 's a huge if as it 's not happening . 
  and the amount of immigrants in finland is small even when you account for the foreing-born naturalized persons who have gained citizenship . 
  see the statistics here : http://stat.fi/til/vaerak/2012/vaerak_2012_2013-03-22_kuv_004_en.html, 
   on one side we have radicals that would like to wipe out every last gypsie or deport them and on the other side we have politically correct people that will do anything to brand anybody who tries to find a compromise as a racist . 
  inbetween is a quiet majority . 
  what a way to draw lines . 
   now , sort this out . 
  superficial way to define social problems and i 'm sure you could do better than simply defining your ideas of black and white and then feeling helpless . 
   for example , instead of the darkest red , use white , and where you now use green , use dark blue . 
  then increase the saturation of the blue as you go up . 
  as a finn i support this idea . 
  seriously only blue and white in infographichs for now on guise . 
  and who knows , on the long run it might even be an incentive for all you other nations towards finnish levels of progress . 
  edit : ah . 
  is only of joke . 
  on arrogant always lecturing nordics stereotypes . 
  the finnish police has a ( tiny ) unit dedicated for the internet , it 's very interactive in their communication and through the years has gained a lot of internet fame over here . 
  and really , who could n't just love our local internet policeman [ fobba ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=fobba&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=9tp&amp;rls=org.mozilla:fi:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=-zvxuaawbtss4qtdnihqaw&amp;ved=0cc4qsaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=861 ) . 
   while we admire your lovely ladies . 
  sorry to hear you guys just admiring . 
  friend zoned ? 
  wage , salary , yearly earnings - who cares about the difference anyway . 
  33,81 equals to 33.81 33 810,00 equals to 33.810,00 equals to 33,810.00 not confusing at all , as long as you do n't think about it . 
  having automation that is applicable in a lot of situations is not enough . 
  replacing the engineer/driver would need automation for * all * situations , and having such tech for both the rails and trains is not easy at all . 
  just for one small scale example the project to make helsinki metro fully automated had to be cancelled not because of the unions but as the technical challenges were too expensive : [ helsinki cancels metro automation project - manual guidance by train drivers to remain ] ( http://www.hs.fi/english/article/helsinki+cancels+metro+automation+project/1329104152769 ), 
   did it ? 
  you know i do n't know about that , cause i have n't heard anything on the news . 
  which according to your logic means that they have n't stood up for the victims and they are evil and ignorant . 
  please do not try and hang a certain twisted logic on to me . 
  it was * you * who brought up norway in the first place , and what i said about norway is rather simple and true : both the officials and the general public overwhelmingly stood up for the victims . 
  but i think your comparison is not very good one to beging with and does little to enlighten us . 
   here are some articles about hungarians expressing their grief for the victims and/or outrage towards the purpotrators : this is very good to hear , and i do hope that those displays of sympathy towards the victims has an effect upon attitudes . 
  all of the hungarians i personally know have very much condemned such acts , and none of them have racist attitudes towards the roma . 
  but then again the people i know are mostly artists and people from different subcultures , and are not supporters of the jobbik or fidez . 
   really , i 'm getting tired of this shit and anti-hungarian hatred on this subreddit . 
  i 've been on this subreddit for almost 2 years and the only positive thread i 've read about hungary was the one that i posted myself . 
  you people wo n't check any facts , so just downvote away ... 
  listen , it is not simply black and white . 
  i am far from anti-hungarian . 
  in fact i 've been very fond of hungary almost all my life - ever since the '70s when some hungarians visited my school as i was about 7-8 and i became practically first aware of the country 's existence . 
  having visited hungary multiple ( yet too few ) times since the '80s i love that country , i love the beauty of it , i love budapest , i love balaton , i love the food , wine and specialties , the friendly people i 've met etc. . . to put it simply : i < 3 hungary . 
  ( but i do not love some of the popular political parties and their exploits ), 
  which has not been due to investments into ict , but due to other big structural changes in the society and economy . 
  as much of a concern it may be i do n't belive for a second that making less investements into ict and related infrastructure would lessen the migration . 
   i agree , i just have a feeling that besides the physical computer ( which is more of high-tech technology , engineering and physics than it ) , the it sector does n't have anything of real value within . 
  let 's just for one example say you have a business to run . 
  which is more efficient way to keep records of your business , balances , clients , bills , orders and market analyses : spreadsheets with related database or a series of paper files and cards in an archive ? 
  there 's value in doing things more efficiently .
