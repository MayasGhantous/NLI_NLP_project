  software and services designed for that purpose are very valuble for their users , and therefore have real value for which they 're willing to make investments and payments . 
  and additionally software provides easy ways to do things which are not practical or even possible without it , and brings totally new applications of technology ( e.g. 
  data mining , data analysis , computers in film industry etc , etc. . . ) . 
  because norway as a country and society , both the general public and officials , strongly stood up for the victims . 
  terror attacks indeed . 
  yet the suspects were only charged with murder . 
   you mean 2008 ? 
  fta : `` on feb. 29 , 2009 , right-wing extremists set fire to r\u00f3bert csorba 's house and shot the family when they tried to escape . '', 
   the countryside is basically empty already which is a pitty cause it 's a beautiful one . 
  yet the utilised agricultural area has been actually growing in estonia . 
  agricultural employment used to be much higher , but after the collectivization was dismantled two decades ago the trend has been for bigger farms with less workforce . 
   the question is how smart it is to put all the eggs in one basket only . 
  to my knowledge estonia is not doing that . 
  the problem is that only 10 % of finns consume 50 % of all alcohol . 
  so some finns - most of them working age males - are heavy drinkers with associated human costs to them and their families plus economic costs to society ( medical and social , loss of productivity etc. . ) . 
  to alleviate the problem there 's two important points : availability of intervention and treatment services , and people 's attitudes . 
  there is intervention and treatment services available for those who need them and volunteer to them . 
  i do n't know if there should be even more , but if more services are needed or they need more funding i 'd support rising the taxes on spirits , but not as readily on wines and beer . 
  the second point may be harder to change . 
  people tend to judge and frown upon persons having alcohol problems . 
  many tend to see alcoholism as a personal fault and lack of character , not as a treateble disease . 
  this leads many to hide and deny their alcohol problem as long as they can , and not seek help in time . 
  i have seen this happening in a workplace . 
  the person with the problem was judged and frowned upon , he did not get ( or seek ) help , and eventually lost his job . 
  better attitude would be to help the person to recognize the problem and give support to seek help . 
  i have also seen this happening in a different workplace . 
  the person with the problem got help to recognize it , he was not left alone with the problem , and the whole team at the workplace supported him in the following treatment . 
  he kept his job and recovered . 
   was n't there a case about a little girl being prosecuted for downloading a song ? 
  not the girl but her father was under criminal investigation . 
  it never went into prosecution or court as it was settled before . 
  edit : juliette and her father popped a soda bottle in celebration of the  50000 names : http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/julietten+nalle+puh+-l%c3%a4pp%c3%a4ri+nosti+myrskyn/a1374549638511?ref=hs-top4-2, 
  not meaningless proposal at all as the finnish legislation is stricter than the eu copyright directives , it 's possible to change national legislation and still be in line with relevant directives . 
  and in quite many other questions the uk results differ from most other countries . 
  for example it 's the only country where majority ( 53 % vs 36 % ) thinks their country would do better outside the eu . 
  ( qa22a .9 : '' ( our country ) could better face the future outside the eu '' ), 
  here 's the full survey [ tables of results ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_anx_en.pdf ) ( pdf ) . 
  and for those interested in comparing results , and making graphs and maps here 's [ eurobarometer interactive search system ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/cf/index.cfm?lang=en ) . 
  good point , corruption should be included as an option . 
  is there ay way to propose that to the eurobarometer folks ? 
  or would adding that option break the standard part of the barometer ? 
  just to point out : the question was not about worries , but more neutrally about currently important ` issues ' ( `` what do you think are the two most important issues facing [ your country ] at the moment ? '' ) . 
  and yes , ` health and social security ' is currently an important issue here in finland as it is being reformed . 
  plus the reforming effort has not proceeded too well so far , and it has taken longer than originally planned . 
  so it 's not just because of the media hype . 
  finns putting ` health and social security ' as the second most important current issue ( 37 % ) is because it actually * is * a very important current issue here . 
  otoh that 's not how history works . 
  same events do not happen and do not need to happen everywhere just because they have happened once upon a time in the west as if those historical events were some kind of universally applicable necessary phases . 
  things change and currently the orthodox church has a lot of power in russia . 
  yet it did n't yield such power during the communist regime . 
  its modern status is quite recent development . 
  it may even be reminiscent of tsarist times but not the same as russia has changed quite a lot since . 
  case in point : [ t.a.t.u. ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t.a.t.u . ), 
  they were very popular in russia and their public image was specifically accentuated as lesbian ( whether that was their true sexual identity or not ) . 
  despite the prominently lesbian image they were endorsed to represent russia in eurovision song contest 2003 . 
  and here 's t.a.t.u. 
  performing in 2009 eurovision semifinal in moscow as an interval act : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=typdkng0yvo, 
  yes , some people may have a self-contradictory position like that . 
  yet the question itself is not irrational , it 's the opinion that some may live as they wish as long as they do not live as they wish ( the must keep it hidden clausule ) that 's irrational . 
   you call protecting one 's own people from de facto invasion , the usurpation of their identities and possession of their small homelands xenophobia ? 
  ... `` xenophobic , '' in your terminology mr. mayfield , means resisting this torrent of hatred for native european populations . 
  it means protecting one 's ancient birthright . 
  it is what i would call not xenophobic , but heroic . 
  what a load of crap with the `` de facto invasion '' and all . 
  edit : condoning such irrational fears is the very epithome of a phobia , and as it 's projected towards a foreign or outside group yes it is indeed [ xenophobia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xenophobia ) , not heroism . 
  fta :  [ 1 ] in this article , `` xenophobia '' refers to any political platform that calls for the strict limitation of immigration , strengthened border controls , the reform or abolition of the schengen zone , or even the expulsion of minorities . 
  looks like people over there are trotting the usual excuses as to why it can work only in [ nordic country ] and [ nordic country ] only , such as : they do n't have the defence spending , they 're homogenous , they 're small , they 're rich in natural resources , they 're sparsely populated , they 're densely populated etc. . . 
  the same always happens when there 's similar article about [ nordic country ] even here in reddit . 
  / u/biotech9 put it well and concisely in his top comment when this same article was posted in truereddit : http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/1i37hg/finland_has_cheaper_medical_care_smarter_children/ that comment could be pretty much copypasted to any similar post about [ nordic country ] and it would be a relevant summary of the discussion . 
   i think osama bin laden did in no way expect the us to react the way they did . 
  he hoped the us government would reconsider their strategy for the muslim world . 
  ( writing this from memory , without actual quotes ) obl outlined his strategy related to us in various statements and interviews in the late '90s . 
  one of his stated aims was to get the us enganged into a war on his home turf . 
   the difference between islam and christianity today is that muslims are still living in the mindset of medieval christianity . 
  any way i try to read it , this sentence does not make any sense at all . 
  it 's as if someone had taken the most misguided notions of history combined with anachronisms , put into a big blender with xenophoby , mixed it , and then poured as a blue waffle for everybody to wonder . 
   but when you see the absurd numbers presented here indeed . 
  you simply can not directly compare crime rates in one specific group with the general population without coming to absurd numbers and conclusions . 
  there 's many factors at play , starting with simple demographics ( median age ) to the socioeconomics , which render such direct comparisons misleading at best . 
   edit : what i hate about reddit is that people downvoting me are men who will never know what it 's like . 
  well , what i dislike about reddit is posters complaining about downvotes when they are on positive , and what 's even worse making distasteful public assumptions about what kind of people might have been downvoting . 
  basic / r/circlejerk material right there . 
   in the us, 
  and it 's also linked to age . 
  criminologists tend to say that the best method of preventing crime is to celebrate one 's 30th birthday . 
  younger persons are much more prone to commit crimes than older persons . 
  most immigrants are young , and therefore more prone to commit crimes compared to the whole general population with higher median age , and direct comparisons of rate of crime may be misleading . 
  you claimed : `` unbiased and objective sources do n't exist '' you failed to demonstrate that even in a such a simple case . 
  and your anectdote about your personal existentialist attitudes is irrelevant to the matter . 
  at least as a practice for your rational mind you actually should put your own claim under doubt . 
  and not look the easy way out such as `` i have nothing to prove '' , as then you can pretty much belive anything , however irrational and illsourced it is . 
   they are legit polls by legit pollers that were scrutinised by respectable journalists and released in mainstream newspapers as well as broadcast on mainstream news media . 
  so please do provide those polls . 
  just for an example the claim `` 28 % of british muslims want britain to be an islamic state '' does not actually appear in the given source . 
  how is that `` legit '' to you ? 
  making claims about polls does not make any of those claims `` legit '' or even informative . 
  there are many polls with different sampling , different questions , done at different times , and with different results . 
  do you know for example to what extent they are comparable and how ? 
  no , you do not . 
  when one cherry picks just parts of news reports that happen to fit personal agenda and misrepresents the actual polls , it is very very misleading .
