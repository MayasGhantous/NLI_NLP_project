  not `` legit '' at all . 
  what is the geographical area that you consider to be the civilized part of the world and why ? 
  claim : 1 = 1 source : me please demonstrate bias and how it affects the claimed result . 
  all your claims are based on a set of cherry picked news quotes on a website with an agenda . 
  the quotes appear to relate to different polls from various times and for some irrational reason they 're all mixed up and presented as a single mess of quote mining . 
  you do not provide the actual polls , actual sampling , actual questions made , and actual results . 
  why is that ? 
  your cherry picked quotes related to completely different opinion polls made with different questions , different times , and different sampling is not representative of much anything but your personal agenda . 
  when you claim `` british muslims '' this or `` british muslims '' that you 're likely wrong both in your misrepresentation and in your overt generalizations as you do not account for the actual polls , their actual questions , their actual samples , and their differences . 
  i hear here in the western world we have free education and all , and try appear so freaking smart compared to others even taking some pride on that - whether justified or not . 
  that basic education should provide the necessary tools of rational thinking to apply to such idiocy as that particular page represents . 
  shame . 
   if you look at uncensored crime records , yes muslims are disproportionately represented in them , i do not know what you refer to as `` uncensored crime records '' , perhaps the raw numbers ? 
  when reading any crime statistics one has to tread very carefully , because they can easily be very very misleading . 
  instead of eyeballing the raw numbers , i 'd recommend to carefully listen to criminologists with * relevant experteese * to actually interpret the statistics . 
  for example , it is an old criminologist adage that the most effective crime prevention method is to celebrate your 30th birthday . 
  it means that a young person is much more prone to commit crime than a middle-aged or old person . 
  and the steepest drop happens somewhere around 30 years of age . 
  by far most immigrants are young . 
  that is one significant reason that immigrants are overrepresented in crime statistics when compared to the whole population . 
  and when one is to interpret the numbers one has to account for the demographics . 
  the same goes for socio-economic background etc. 
  it 's also important to note that while those factors are very significant , they do not always explain the whole difference . 
  yet they are there , and not accounting for them is a misleading way to read and interpret statistics . 
  i do n't know the statistics in your home country , so i 'll use finland as an example . 
  members of our local `` we 're not racists , but ... '' - party sometimes trot crime statistics as an example of how horrible immigrants must be . 
  they commonly use cherry picked raw numbers , wich they refer to as `` uncensored '' numbers - as if there was some kind of government censor changing those numbers in the first place . 
  then they make colorful claims how `` immigrants '' or `` muslims '' or [ pick your minority ] commit manyfold more crime than the decent native finns . 
  the problem with their claims is that they do not account for the other significant factors at play . 
  and when actual expert criminologists publishes their results which are different , the `` we 're not racists , but ... '' - guys go apes how the numbers have been `` censored '' and how it 's all just leftist lies . 
   and emergency ( police , firefighters , ambulance personnel , doctors ... ) workers become racist after a short while serving in large cities . 
  well , just awful to hear that the vital institutions one should be able to trust turn racist . 
  what is there to trust after that ? 
   this video of muslims sabotaging an art film was featured recently on reddit . 
  many muslims are unashamedly homophobic , an attitude which is n't tolerable in civilized parts of the world . 
  you mean like homophobic [ orthodox priests and neo-nazis violently protesting a play in greece ] ( http://www.google.fi/?gws_rd=cr#sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=greece+homosexual+corpus+christi+protest&amp;oq=greece+homosexual+corpus+christi+protest&amp;gs_l=serp.3...6742.13060.1.14054.15.14.0.0.0.9.820.6054.2-3j4j2j4j1.14.0....0...1c.1.21.serp.t_mwdsehvi4&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;fp=3f8ad3a35e06462d&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=613 ) ? 
  actually the society tolerated that to the point that it was the * artists * who got charged for blasphemy . 
  but that hardly means that greece is not a part of civilized world , or a civilized part of the world for that matter . 
  booze cruises and bang boats ftw . 
  if you do visit helsinki i recommend also to visit tallinn , ferry trips easy and plenty . 
  do try , good sahti is amazing - but it 's difficult to find good sahti in shops . 
  according to michael jackson sahti is the only primitive beer to survive in western europe , and he was known for making it better known internationally . 
  he visited sahti makers in finland on many occasions and wrote a lot about it . 
  his blog has entertaining and informative articles about making , finding and drinking sahti : http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/sahti.html, 
  tbf , we also do have some great beers in finland - for example the [ sinebrychoff porter ] ( http://www.examiner.com/review/thursday-tastings-sinebrychoff-porter ) , which also was one of michael jackson 's favourites . 
  great idea !, 
  yeah , let 's pick and choose the most worrisome hearing parts of numerous opinions by different people , glue them together and call that an analysis , shall we ? 
  not to say there 's no problems in the ea , but c'mon cnbc . 
  thanks , i 'll try to remember that . 
  and i say that without any sarcasm as i often wish a native speaker would correct the grammatical errors in my posts . 
  here 's the overall ranking of 60 countries : [ imd releases its 25th anniversary world competitiveness rankings ] ( http://www.imd.org/news/world-competitiveness-2013.cfm ), 
  here 's the [ source ] ( http://russiansphinx.blogspot.fi/2013/02/rubbish-map-of-europe.html ) . 
  the map uses data from the world bank : [ what a waste : a global review of solid waste management ] ( http://web.worldbank.org/wbsite/external/topics/exturbandevelopment/0,,contentmdk:23172887~pagepk:210058~pipk:210062~thesitepk:337178,00.html ) the map represents municipal waste generated , and does not account for recycling or means of disposal . 
  the data is from 2006 so perhaps it is a bit old already . 
  here 's a more recent eurostat [ map from 2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/25neqwp ) . 
  the eu average municipal waste generated is about 500 kg/person/year .

  loved it when i saw it in tv for the fist time as a kid ( ~ 10 ? ), 
  and never forget how it felt to see the profound 11th episode : [ the ascent of man - knowledge or certainty ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqofqboaftc ) and it still is very very relevant . 
  if there 's something essential to save for the future generations , that episode would be high on the list - especially these [ last fifteen minutes ] ( http://youtu.be/hqofqboaftc?t=30m ) . 
  which incidentally reminds me of ( my other childhood favourite ) james burke 's brilliant [ connections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connections_\\ ( tv_series \\ ) ) . 
   baikonur is in ukraine , yes ? 
  nope , it 's in kazakhstan . 
  but there 's aerospace industry in ukraine . 
  and meanwhile about 6000 persons have left the church since r\u00e4s\u00e4nen opened her mouth : http://eroakirkosta.fi/static/ek-tilastot/ to the church this equals to a yearly economic loss of about $ 2.8 million . 
  ukraine has significant [ aviation and aerospace industries ] ( http://www.ukrexport.gov.ua/eng/economy/ukr/203.html ) , has signed a cooperation agreement with esa and is aspiring to membership . 
  no , obviously it renders war obsolete . 
  when china rules the world as history dictates there will be no reason for war . 
  and now we can hear about it for example in tv . 
  [ cu\u00e9ntame c\u00f3mo pas\u00f3 ] ( http://yle.fi/ohjelmat/1781 ) has been popular here in finland . 
   if you look at what the common view of a tolerant society was nowadays it would actually be seen as quite oppressive . 
  that notion reeks of anacronism . 
  which mediaval society could not be seen as quite oppressive by nowadays standards . 
  has no bearing on how the caliphate of cordoba was compared to other contemporary states . 
   no , of course not , but it * could * be the reason , could n't it ? 
  quite many things * could * be a reason . 
  it 's whole another matter to demonstrate that they actually are and to what extent . 
   i am correlating your currency with your economy . 
  more accurately you 're trying to correlate it to the double-dipper and finland 's slower recovery compared to sweden . 
  but like i said it does not demonstrate causation . 
   why are you comparing it to the uk ? 
  did it just to show you that uk , a country without euro , has also been slow to recover , and to emphasize that simple correlation does not prove causation . 
   what have you done ( or not done ) differently ? 
  can not say , i have not enough knowledge of what sweden has done for a meaningful comparison of those differences . 
   i mean , you have suffered since the euro crises . 
  we have n't . 
  i do n't see how one can not factor in the euro . 
  correlation is not causation - just because finland has the euro does not make it the reason for a double-dipper . 
  just for an example the uk does not have the euro , and compare : [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6bzeejb ) now , even if the graphs look superficially similar i 'm not saying the reasons are the same both in uk and finland . 
  like i said in case of finland there 's many reasons for that loss competitiveness , and some of those may or may not be similar to uk . 
   finland - what are you doing ? 
  suffering a double-dipper : [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/katpoxd.png ) ( [ source ] ( http://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/tilastot/indikaattorit/pages/tilastot_indikaattorit_bkt_ja_ttuotanto_amuutos_chrt_en.aspx ) ) our recovery is certainly behind you sweden since 2009 : [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wltrdu6.jpg ) ( [ source ] ( http://www.ekonomifakta.se/en/facts-and-figures/economy/economic-growth/gdp/?from51=2000&amp;amp;to51=2012&amp;amp;columns51=,1,3,7 , ) )  is this because of the euro ? 
  euro has it 's good sides and bad sides , and would be overtly simplistic reason . 
  generally people blame loss of competitiveness , and there 's many reasons for that . 
  so far the government has n't achieved much on that front ( except making cuts ) , but they lowered the corporate tax to 20 % from 2014 on . 
  next autumn will be crucial in negotiating collective labor agreements , and there 's a lot of talk how everybody should be ready to tighten their belts and not go for rises . 
  and there has been some preliminary discussion about a stimulus too . 
  next fall will be interesting , but whatever decisions are made it will take time until it gets reflected in the gdp . 
  also yle news in english : [ interior minister compares abortion to butchery ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/interior_minister_compares_abortion_to_butchery/6727521 )  the interior minister let it be understood that in a conflicting situation , the bible should take precedence over the law .
