  after the bit cryptic statement by the dutch fm more clarifying details were published : http://content1b.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m6402523160bf2c510054366c70000000.2b598e7d988c138a1c1dec0852bda928/nos/docs/091014_brief_om_timmermans.pdf the australian in question is the only victim known to have an oxygen mask around the neck . 
  the mask was tested for fingerprints , saliva and dna but none was found . 
  it is unclear how and when the mask got around the victim 's neck . 
  then the appririate thing to do would be to sue the organisation for false advertising and seeking damages .

  tl ; dr what was the reason claimed ? 
  the bolded part does n't seem to be an answer but a question . 
  did n't watch the video . 
  what is the reason it claims ? 
  that graph does not tell how big source of energy natural gas actually is in each country , or its share in the energy mix , and how dependend the countries actually are . 
  for example , sweden uses very little natural gas . 
  even if 100 % of that tiny amount of gas is from russia sweden is hardly dependend on it . 
  and while finland currently gets 100 % of its natural gas from russia , that gas is only about 10 % of all primary energy usage and would be replaced by other sources of energy if it was cut off . 
   is n't donetsk under seperatist control ? 
  so would n't this have to be an ukrainian mortar attack ? 
  no , not necessarily . 
  for example in the shelling of that donetsk school couple of days ago [ the osce monitors reported ] ( http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/124979 ) that the rockets were possibly fired from south which would point to insugents . 
  i do n't know where or even what your ` loop ' might be , all i can say is glad i 'm not part it . 
  but yes : exaggeration is a very common device of satire . 
  in the case of op 's comment the purpose was not to provide a literal quote but a satirical one delivering the general sentiment . 
  being the brave bot that you are you probably could not recognize it as such . 
  so , if it ever so happens in the future that you may read a literal work of the satirical genre , do n't be surprised and fall back into your ` does not compute ' loop if it uses exaggeration . 
  just to point out a more or less relevant distinction ( and probably not relevant to your point ) : likely most of them do buy into kremlin propaganda , but they do not follow particularly russia today as it 's the english language kremlin propaganda media . 
  only about 5 % of russians have knowledge of english , so a vast majority likely do not follow any english language media . 
  the propaganda * they * buy into is provided by kremlin in russian speaking media they control , and the what we see/hear/read on russia today is propaganda almost solely directed for us international english speaking audiences .

  another thing that comes to mind is the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia by the soviet union and its subservient warsaw pact forces . 
   so why should they help us ? 
  no-one 's asking for their `` help '' . 
  buying and selling gas is not `` help '' but business . 
  what rouhani said was :  speaking to a russian magazine , rouhani said : `` we will not be an alternative for russia if it stops exporting natural gas to europe . '', 
  and that is true . 
  the simple fact is that iran is not an alternative for a sudden stop of russian gas because iran * could n't * export gas to the eu - because there are no pipelines to do that . 
  but iran has expressed interest for such pipeline project . 
  and if the relevant pipeline gets built then iran would be not only an alternartive but a * direct competitor * to russian gas . 
  us , not eu .

  fta :  ** i feel repressed ** by not being allowed to express my views . 
  i have permanent troubles with this . 
  suddenly i have discovered , for the first time in 20 years , having been invited to be a keynote speaker at a conference , that the organisers find out i have reservations about the eu , about same-sex marriages , about the ukraine crisis , and they say , `` we are very sorry , we have already found a different keynote speaker , thank you very much . '' this is something i had experienced in the communist era but not in so-called free europe . 
  only a very narrow range of opinions is now considered politically correct . ' he claims he was not invited as a keynote speaker to `` a conference '' and he * feels repressed * ? 
  aww , must be terrible to have his feelings of entitlement hurt that way . 
  obviously can not be because there may be also other people in the world that may have interesting things to say , so ' a conference ' exercising its liberty to invite a keynote speaker they actually want to appear on * their venue * , and not inviting mr. klaus as a keynote speaker is worse than communism and everyone else 's fault but his . 
  brilliant . 
  i also like how the journalist neil clark does not in any way question mr. klaus 's personal anecdote ( which conference ? 
  when ? 
  who gave the keynote then ? 
  ect ) and merely retells it like a good fanboy . 
  did i say * a fanboy * ? 
  oh yes . 
  because for some reason this very same neil clark chalks all the failures of '90s privatizations on v\u00e1clav havel ( [ v\u00e1clav havel : another side to the story ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/19/vaclav-havel-another-side-to-story ) ) but fails to remember that actually the privatization policies and the corruption therein was his hero 's , mr.klaus ' , doings . 
  actually at the time v\u00e1clav havel heavily critized the voucher privatizations spearheaded and pushed though by mr. klaus . 
  but that is not all , mr.klaus ' privatization policies were prone to corruption which was prevalent , and for some reason fortunes ended to his pals . 
  and i feel justified to call them his pals as one of mr.klaus ' last decrees as a president was giving an amnesty to them and stopping the criminal proceedings : [ vaclav klaus 's controversial amnesty ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/01/czech-politics )  with his amnesty , the president also stopped ongoing criminal proceedings that have lasted longer than eight years under one condition , which is that defendants face at most 10 years in jail . 
  this category happens to include several notorious embezzlement and fraud cases that signify the wild post-communist overhaul of the economy in the 1990s , which was spearheaded by mr klaus . 
  yeah , a real model conservative we have here . 
  this guy is one of the reasons why privatization - a sensible policy if done right - has so bad rap in europe . 
  also , a fun anecdote in the comments :  in chile , we remember vaclav klaus as the visiting czech president who stole a valuable pen during a press conference .
