  `` we have to consider whether we have the courage to act in the face of general public opinion or norms , peer pressure , and sometimes even the law , if these contradict the word of god , '' r\u00e4s\u00e4nen said . 
  as guideline to conflicts between the bible and the law , r\u00e4s\u00e4nen , whose ministerial post also includes religious affairs , borrowed from the words of the apostles , saying , `` we must obey god rather than men . '',

  the expression appeared as # 1 on cracked 's list of words that english needs : http://www.cracked.com/article_19695_9-foreign-words-english-language-desperately-needs_p2.html, 
  it works the other way too : some of the conservative members do also leave as a protest against church 's policies . 
  here 's a recent example : [ finnish mission sends same-sex pair to cambodia ] ( http://scandhouse.org/current/1306/felm_gay_pair.html ) conservative members protested that decision , and it led to a spike of conservatives leaving the church : http://www.eroakirkosta.fi/media/none/tiedote_04_2013.html?year=2013 ( [ gtransl .

  that 's finland alright .

   really ? 
  as i already said . 
   in the 90 % region of sameness that measure makes no sense at all . 
   i suggest you read up on the similarities between the european constitutional treaty and the lisbon treaty . 
  similarities do not make them the same thing . 
   everyone , pro and con , concedes lisbon is pretty much the same as the proposed constitution . 
  quote mining does not make them the same thing .

  the cover page of my passport has european union , my country and the word passport in finnish and swedish as both are finland 's national languages . 
  and on index page it has the same in 21 languages . 
  for personal data fields it has four languages : finnish , swedish , english ( lingua franca ) and french ( lingua franca of diplomacy ) . 
  pitchforks aside , the administration choosing not to prosecute does not neccessarily mean there was no wrongdoings done or no frauds committed . 
  see for example this informative pbs/frontline 's piece of investigative journalism `` the untouchables '' : [ fallout from ` untouchables ' documentary : another wall street whistleblower gets reamed ] ( http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/fallout-from-untouchables-documentary-another-wall-street-whistleblower-gets-reamed-20130304 ) [ is wall street still `` untouchable '' ?

  de gaulle 's vision was hardly `` an empire '' . 
  but it is true he tried to increase french power in europe by demanding more intergovernmental community and give less power to supranational organs , which would have ment less integration . 
  edit : i also find some historical irony in there , as these days those same things are promoted by many euroskeptics : less integration , less supranational , more intergovernmental , more power to ( our ) country . 
  edit2 : just to clarify my previous point : there was no plan `` to turn the eu into an empire '' , and de gaulle 's vision for eec was not such plan either . 
  to claim it was an attempt `` to turn the eu into an empire '' is simply incorrect . 
  there 's no such plan . 
  then again one could argue that de gaulle had a point in his assessment that uk is too different to become a member . 
  not that i personally agree with that , but that 's what one often hears from british euroskeptics these days . 
  [ 1967 : de gaulle says ` non ' to britain - again ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm ) france was opposed to uk 's membership and charles de gaulle , the french president , threatened to veto its application to join the european economic community ( eec ) . 
  france was the only country opposed and de gaulle warned other members that if they insist on uk 's membership it will lead to break-up of the community . 
   general de gaulle accused britain of a `` deep-seated hostility '' towards european construction . 
  he said london showed a `` lack of interest '' in the common market and would require a `` radical transformation '' before joining the eec . 
  `` the present common market is incompatible with the economy , as it now stands , of britain , '' he said . 
  he went on to list a number of aspects of britain 's economy , from working practices to agriculture , which he said made britain incompatible with europe . 
  de gaulle had previously vetoed uk 's application to join in 1963 . 
  only after he fell from power in 1969 did his successor georges pompidou lift the veto , and in 1970 the negotiations for uk 's membership began . 
  russia is currently building new [ vostochny cosmodrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vostochny_cosmodrome ) to reduce its dependency on baikonur . 
  it 's a direct income tax or * yle-vero * of about 50-140 $ depending on income .

  welcome croatia !, 
  or anything at all for that matter . 
  indeed , just throwing more money at iter wo n't make a fusion power plant happen much faster . 
  it might make building iter a bit quicker , but there 's still the fundamental research part to do . 
   we 're still nowhere . 
  well in fact we are . 
  based on [ the previous research ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tokamak#experimental_tokamaks ) we already know a tokamak fusion reactor works , and we know how to control a fusion process that produces more energy than it takes . 
  there 's no doubt that iter will output a lot more energy than it 's input , and sustain the reaction . 
  but before commercial power plants can happen , there still is unresolved problems for example in materials and engineering . 
  these problems are one important part of iter 's research . 
  in the european commission 's strategy the current proposal for an actual nuclear fusion power plant is [ demo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demo ) as a followup to the iter ( around 2030-40 ) . 
  and after that there 's a proposal for the first commercial fusion power plant proto ( post 2050 ) . 
  indeed not mainstream over there , and there 's not much moose to have . 
  i do n't know if nordic countries export moose anywhere , but i hope not . 
  the only reason i can have moose steaks is because my father hunts them . 
  are you saying there 's a taboo of not eating moose ? 
  it 's not horse , you know . 
  very different animal . 
  you could say it 's big as a horse , but that does n't turn it into a horse . 
  it 's a wild animal of totally different breed . 
  and delicious . 
  personally i 'd love to taste berries native to canada . 
  you can buy peanut butter in convenient stores over here . 
  do n't know if it 's specifically canadian though . 
  i believe the most common brand over here is amona which is malaysian , i think . 
  over here i 'm always careful to buy only canadian brand maple syrup even if it 's a bit more expensive sometimes . 
  some of the us stuff you find over here may be little cheaper but not as good with corn syrup and all . 
  for moose and reindeer things consult nordic countries . 
  just yesterday i finished a delicious moose steak . 
  was successful . 
  beautiful image . 
  but has a feeling of a manipulated or even synthetic image , as i do n't believe any camera on orbit could capture that dynamic range in a single shot , and without any clouds even . 
  origin or source ? 
  to me it looks like a scottish bonnet , also two guys in gb seem to wear them , and there 's one over the ionian islands too . 
  perhaps it 's a refence to british rule or presence . 
   * sigh * * polar bear hug *, 
   it was a quote in the `` rise and fall of the roman empire '' by gibbons . 
  i 'd tread carefully with that book , as it was written over 200 years ago . 
  man , all this talk makes me miss [ lennart meri ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lennart_meri ) . 
  to me he was the attenborough of uralic languages and people with his films . 
   but to fight you need some sort of writing abilities , and because paganism does n't offer any sort of script or any other mean of indirect communication , people started practicing christianity . 
  oops . 
  perhaps you misspoke a bit as we have plenty of evidence of writings and alphabets predating chistianity from ancient middle east and egypt to norse runes etc. 
  i do n't know if the [ birch bark manuscripts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birch_bark_manuscript ) from novgorod predate christianity , but i do find the drawings and writings for example by the ~ seven year old boy onfim fascinating : [ the art of onfim : medieval novgorod through the eyes of a child ] ( http://www.goldschp.net/sig/onfim/onfim.html ),
