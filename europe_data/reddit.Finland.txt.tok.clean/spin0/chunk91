  there 's always something to learn from history : a laskiaispulla wo n't kill you , but 14 in a row just might . 
  and , although they are yet to have own independend country , we should n't forget our cousins the [ mari people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_people ) , who only in the 16th century adopted christianity but have to this day upheld their traditional beliefs and still widely practice them . 
  * `` christianity was adopted by the mari in the 16th century after their territory was incorporated into the russian empire during the reign of ivan iv `` the terrible '' . 
  adoption of christianity was not universal , however , and many mari today still practice paganism in syncretic forms , or purer forms adhering to organized neopagan mari traditional religion organizations . 
  pagans constitute a significant minority of 25 to 40 % of the mari . 
   ( but i suppose it still does n't rule out they may have been influenced by someone finnish ) the horror . 
  the horror . 
  influence of someone finnish . 
  :p seriously , it 's just a webcomic making jokes , and open to critisism as such , but it 's not historiography . 
   nevertheless , the narrative does feel odd to me , and it does fit with the recent nationalistic tendencies of the true finns . 
  leaving true finns party aside , how * is * our long common history taught in school in sweden ? 
   i guess it stems from the fact that we learn very little about the swedish era in comprehensive school . 
  are you sure ? 
  because back in my school days in the '80s it was extensively covered from kings and military to impact to art and society . 
  which is no wonder as those over 600 years covers the most of finland 's written history , and is indeed an important part of it . 
  has something changed there ? 
   i remember learning something about gustav vasa and some stuff like that in elementary school but never really thought it was interesting anyway . 
  then perhaps , and i hope , our different experiences are a matter of perceptions , as i was always very interested in history , and was also lucky to have good teachers . 
  nah , but it 's only a comic with jokes . 
  not to be taken as historiography or too seriously . 
  anyway , through a link there i learned about funny personifications of finland and sweden and other countries in japanese manga and anime : [ strike witches ] ( http://strikewitches.wikia.com/wiki/suomus ) - apparently those female characters are based on finnish wwii aces such as [ ilmari juutilainen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilmari_juutilainen ) . 
  and in [ hetalia ] ( http://hetalia.wikia.com/wiki/sweden/finland ) the complex relationship between sweden and finland is all too funny !, 
  and now take a good look at a 2 $ coin . 
  can not unsee . 
   i would n't be surprised if the author of this comic is a true finn supporter . 
  as the author of the comic is [ an american ] ( http://warmfuzzyglow.com/my-new-project-a-webcomic-about-finland-10257/ ) , i 'd be surprised if he has ever even heard of true finns party , or has a chip on his shoulder . 
   as a swede , i wonder where all all this resentment is coming from . 
  recently maybe just our language dispute overspilling . 
  there is an opposition to the compulsory swedish at schools . 
  and some leave no stone unturned to dig some dirt to fling aroud whether it 's relevant to the compulsory swedish or not . 
  now , i do n't know how it gets reported in sweden , but perhaps there 's a tendency to sensationalize at least in the headlines i 've seen . 
   the truth is that finland was never treated as a colony of sweden . 
  it was a part of sweden , and treated just like any other province of the realm , quite unlike the narrative in this comic . 
  during our 600 years together we had our ups and downs . 
  personally i respect , and love our long common history , but also recognize that it is open to different narratives some closer to ` truth ' than others . 
  all in all , i see that the long period as a part of sweden had a positive impact on finland and it 's future . 
  and some of the swedish kings are fondly remembered in finland . 
  then again . 
  russia easily conquers finland . 
  achievement unlocked : instant autonomy !, 
   anyway , here 's to our common history and glory days !, 
  sure we are . 
  but the comic is authored by [ an american ] ( http://warmfuzzyglow.com/my-new-project-a-webcomic-about-finland-10257/ ) . 
  esa has not excluded russia , as russia has n't been seeking for a membership or an associate membership like canada has . 
  during last two decades the relations between esa and russia 's roscosmos have deepened into significant partnership and cooperation in many areas such as : human spaceflight , launchers , science , earth observation , navigation etc. 
  esa and roscosmos have an partnership agreement ( `` cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes '' ) and roscosmos participates in many projects . 
  more : http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/esp/international-cooperation/russia/index_en.htm esa also has different cooperation agreements with argentina , brazil , china , india and japan . 
  edit : here 's a most recent example : [ jaxa and esa sign amendment to the agreement concerning cooperation in the field of space parts ] ( http://www.jaxa.jp/collabo/int/index_e.html ) ` let 's desing and test our parts in a way that we can * both * use same parts ' is a very good idea to avoid reinventing the wheel and overlapping manufacturing . 
  and it works already . 
  i get your point , but as esa has no rule to exclude non-european countries , i just wanted to add two often neglected countries . 
  israel already has [ a cooperation agreement with esa ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/israel_signs_cooperation_agreement ) , and aspires closer relationship ( perhaps even eventual associate membership ? ) . 
  canada has been an associate member of esa since 1980 and has contributed significantly to projects . 
  canada will also have a role in the exomars project : http://www.urthecast.com/blog/updates/roscosmos-esa-collaborate-to-jumpstart-exomars/ so strictly speaking the headline is not correct as esa is not neccessarily the same as europe . 
  here 's a map of countries with different stages of membership : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_space_agency_enlargement_including_associates.png ( also australia used to be an associate member , but sadly not any more . ), 
  yes , at least in my country ( finland ) . 
  but it obviously depends on issue being reported . 
  if it relates to the federal government it is reported as such ( i.e. 
  us says this and that , us congress votes on something etc ) . 
  if the issue concerns a state or a city then it 's more specific ( i.e. 
  wildfires in colorado , tornado in oklahoma city , detroit probably defaulting etc ) . 
  i 'd think it 's pretty much same way in the us . 
  sounds like a nice event !, 
  reminds me of the [ tall ships ' races ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tall_ships%27_races ) which are held in european waters every year , but the waters get rotated , so every four years it 's for example in the baltic . 
  you could start here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament#elections and here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_the_european_union those have links to further resources . 
  animation europe has a list of over 400 animated feature films from 1926 onwards : http://www.animationeurope.com/filmlist.asp and in imdb someone has made list of almost 300 films : http://www.imdb.com/list/-93epwtlwpo/ they include both adult and children 's films . 
  here 's some animated feature films i 've liked . 
  they 're not all cartoons , some use stop motion or mixed technique . 
  some of them are for kids too : [ the illusionist ( 2010 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_illusionist_ ( 2010_film \\ ) ) [ persepolis ( 2007 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persepolis_ ( film \\ ) ) [ the triplets of belleville ( 2003 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_triplets_of_belleville ) [ otes\u00e1nek ( 2000 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228687/ ) [ kirikou and the sorceress ( 1998 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirikou_and_the_sorceress ) [ krysar ( 1986 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174834/ ) [ when the wind blows ( 1986 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/when_the_wind_blows_ ( film \\ ) ) [ time masters ( 1982 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084315/ ) [ allegro non troppo ( 1976 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074121/ ) [ la plan\u00e8te sauvage ( 1973 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/ ) [ yellow submarine ( 1968 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063823/ ) [ animal farm ( 1954 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047834/ ) edit : oh , and not to forget the obligatory cat : [ pettson & findus ] ( http://www.imdb.com/find?q=pettson+%26+findus&amp;amp;s=all ) ( 1999-2009 ), 
  but still lacks the heavy-metal . 
  that part needs some further progress as we currently do n't have any metal bands for infants . 
  so far just toddlers and kids are covered : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6shd7jrhcm, 
   the united states defines infant mortality more broadly than europe , and therefore overreports infant mortality when compared with many nations in europe . 
  as finland and us have similar definitions it is not a factor when comparing the reported numbers . 
  in * some * european countries there are some differences in definitions ( eg . 
  czech republic , france , ireland ) , but in finland they 're similar to the us . 
   yeah , sorry about ww2 old chap , circumstances demanded the greater good an ' all that . 
   we know . 
  no hard feelings at all . 
  that was the realpolitics of the day . 
   still , you 're in the eu now and we 've got nukes , ai n't nothing bad gon na happen to you lot now . 
  perhaps you see why i 'm not too convinced about that . 
  as spoils of that same war there 's a captured british navy boat in finland . 
  i just wanted to add that . 
   soviet union achieved its goals , even though it took longer than expected . 
  su did not succeed in invading and occupying finland . 
  thanks for stating the obvious , as we 'd be pretty alone if the bear got angry . 
  and indeed it would look grim by the numbers . 
  then again we 've never much counted on anyone really helping us in an actual bear circumstance ( maybe as a lesson from history ) . 
  unfortunately looks like our generations to be are ready cover that : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dhcqsop ), 
  regarding the interest rates greece already has a debt relief program in place . 
  despite the huge amount of debt greece 's interest payments are below eurozone average , and will be kept low for years to come : [ see these charts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zyoo1ar ) the loans issued by greece loan facility and efsf have very low interests . 
  in fact glf loans are below market funding costs of some euro countries , meaning those countries are in a way making fiscal transfers to greece . 
  please see the latest imf report on greece : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr1320.pdf * the margin over 3-month euribor on the $ 53 billion in debt to the greece loan facility ( glf ) was reduced from 150bps to 50ps , and the 10bps operating fee on efsf lending was eliminated . 
  the glf reduction brings it below the market funding cost of some euro area member states , implying an effective fiscal transfer from countries facing larger effective sovereign borrowing spreads . 
  the change in borrowing terms is estimated to alleviate the debt burden over time achieving a cumulative debt reduction by 2020 of approximately 2.6 percentage points of gdp . 
  * now , a haircut is a different matter . 
  i believe some form of haircut would probably be needed at some point before 2020-2022 to meet the target of reducing the debt below 110 % of gdp by 2022 . 
  to keep greece 's debt as is on that trajectory will be difficult , yet not at all impossible . 
  depends on how greece can keep on with the reforms , and on wider macroeconomic developments in the near future . 
  in short : * 64 .
