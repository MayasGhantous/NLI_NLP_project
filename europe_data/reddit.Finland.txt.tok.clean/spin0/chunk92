  while the program aims to mitigate these risks , it is clear that if they do play out , additional debt relief and financing would be needed from greece 's european partners . 
  the program aims to limits risks via upfront policy implementation ( to help put many difficult actions behind the government ) , tighter fiscal rules ( to help prevent future deviations ) , protection for the most vulnerable ( to help contain political stresses ) , and reinforcement of structural reform efforts ( to lay a basis for stronger growth ) . 
  if macro risks play out -- particularly the confidence and transmission mechanism concerns detailed above -- then greece would need more time to adjust , supported by additional debt relief and financing from greece 's european partners . 
  the alternative scenario considered in the dsa gives some indication of the potential needs . 
  in this scenario , to return greece to the program debt trajectory would require about 3 percent of greek gdp per year ( $ 6 billion ) in fiscal transfers between 2013 and 2020 ( which could be delivered through a variety of channels , including lower interest rates on glf and efsf loans ) . 
  alternatively , it would require an upfront haircut of about 25 percent on efsf loans , glf loans , and ecb smp bond holdings . 
  here 's a related interesting view about the short history of neoliberalism : [ when neoliberalism exploded ] ( http://www.salon.com/2013/03/09/the_world_according_to_milton_friedman_partner/ )  rather than emerging from any sort of `` master plan , '' it was , in fact , a series of local choices -- in the face of unyielding inflation , the carter administration 's appointment of paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve board in 1979 , or the reluctant decision of hayekian free marketeers to make uneasy peace with social conservatives -- that led to the neoliberal breakthrough . 
   stedman jones traces the rise of neoliberalism to the decision of left-leaning governments to adopt monetarist policies . 
  his description of this decision is perhaps the most distinctive aspect of his account . 
  to understand how his argument challenges what we think we know of neoliberalism , we need to take a step back , and take a closer look . 
  thank you for the informative post . 
   rigid labour laws guys , you might have started from there , but i can appreciate how popular opposition , incompetence ( and maybe executive 's dependence on unions ) could hinder that . 
  and as the government has not been a good owner of companies which have not been running profit , perhaps at long last it should sell them - or even just give them away by now - to let others run them more efficiently in stead of taxpayers paying for their losses year after year . 
  but but the torygraph has for years told me how we do n't have euro by now . 
  as opposed to finnish marriages . 
   the government did next to nothing on those fronts in almost two years wtf , why not ?? 
  i hope the supreme court of cyprus has also the deep pockets to cover for that . 
  as i 'm not going to pay . 
  the port was owned by greece . 
  they did have both access to capital and very low interest rates * for years * . 
  but that did n't do much good to the port as it now runs better than before . 
   i wonder how a chinese company managing 125,000 greek employees , with their diametrically opposed work ethic is going to play out . 
  port of piraeus will never employ that many . 
  afaik it has about 1500 employees or so . 
  the article refers to secondary effects on local economy , not direct employment by the chinese company running the port . 
  when the port runs more efficiently it also will bring it 's benefits to others not directly employed by it . 
  that 's a good example of why state ownership is not so good idea , and how privatization does have it 's benefits to the economy - generally the results are much better than running nation 's economy as a huge co-op . 
  hopefully you make sure your tractor adheres to the safety standards before shoving off . 
  shhh ... 
  it 's secret , to be discussed on personal blogposts only . 
  man , i do love our common history . 
   now i wish i could find a good clip om livgardets dragon n\u00e4r dom spelar finska rytteriets marsch . 
  well finally a recognition . 
  it 's not like we share for example this military march for nothing : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yskw4sju4, 
  too late . 
  by using the word `` facts '' and at the same time actually posting facts you 're now a self-proclaimed eu shill . 
  there goes your # 400 000 pension . 
  figures , arrogant swedes always forgetting that the finns were in it too : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hakkapeliitta we pillaged as bravely as the swedes and we 're just as entitled to pay reparations as you are !, 
  and by googling the article id . 
  you mean you were not jumping up and down and screaming `` omg !, 
  i 'm going to paris ! '' . 
  all the american movies where it happens have lied to me ?? 
  please say it is n't so . 
   the nine months sounds like you 're within the quite normal envelope for the culture shock to * really * kick in . 
  i 'm not sure it 's just about paris per se as you 'd probably had to deal with the culture shock in most other european cities too . 
  without knowing much anything about your situation my simple practical advice to you would be not to give up easily , and to seek other expat 's company in paris and discuss the issues with them . 
  travelling around might help too , like taking trips to the countryside , to the alps or coast , or to other cities by train or plane ( how about marseille ? 
  etc ) . 
  then again , you could always try for example london . 
  i hear it 's a wondrous city of song and laughter with everybody going chim-chiminey-chim-chiminey . 
   crisis can happen in finland , they had one in the early 1990 's , for example . 
  of course it can . 
  but that does n't mean finland 's economy would be `` just as fragile '' as some other economies have shown to be . 
  and in q2/2009 we actually had a whopping record drop * -10 % * of gdp , and -7.8 % through the year - the worst since the civil war 1918 . 
  yet finland managed that crisis by herself without asking the help of imf or eu taxpayers , without general strikes or riots on the streets , without having an excessive rise of public debt , and while retaining it 's high credit rating . 
  apparently finland handled the crisis so smoothly that not everybody seem to be aware of it at all . 
   here 's more info : [ finland 's economy - from shock to recovery ] ( http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=186895&amp;amp;nodeid=41805&amp;amp;contentlan=2&amp;amp;culture=en-us ) [ finland - recovery taking hold after a record fall in gdp ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/forecasts/2010_spring/fi_en.pdf ) * `` in spite of the exceptionally rapid drop in gdp , the economy has maintained solid fundamentals and is well placed to return to a growth path slightly above the eu average . 
  '' * it pays to have `` solid fundamentals '' especially in a time of crisis . 
   europe could easily simply print the money . 
  quantitative ease its way out of this . 
  ecb can not print money to cover for public debts . 
  for example see : [ ecb ` can not print money ' ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe/ecb-cannot-print-money-1.741561 )  `` we should remember that the ecb can not undertake monetary financing , can not replace what other member states should do , '' mr draghi told lawmakers in brussels in his capacity as head of the european systemic risk board . 
  `` this is true for ireland , and this is true for every other case like this . 
  it 's too easy to think that the ecb can replace governments ' action , or lack of it , by printing money . 
  that 's not going to happen . '', 
  and further elaboration here : [ why the ecb wo n't ( and should n't ) just print ] ( http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc111121.htm )  there are three basic difficulties with this idea . 
  ( 1 ) the first is that ecb buying might help to address immediate liquidity issues of distressed european countries , but it would not address long-term solvency issues , and would in fact make them worse . 
  ( 2 ) the second is that ** the ecb , under existing european treaties , has no such authority ** , and the prohibitions against it are very explicit . 
  changing that would be far more difficult than many market participants seem to believe , because it would require an explicit and unanimous change in the eu treaties that aaa rated countries such as germany and finland vehemently oppose . 
  ( 3 ) the third difficulty is that even if the ecb was to buy the debt of distressed european countries with printed money , the inflationary effects would likely be far more swift than anything we 've seen in the united states . 
  this would not `` save '' the euro , but would simply destroy it by other means . 
  there 's two obvious negative sides in introducing a legislation with depositor preference in bank resolution : tends to make risk-avert big money move or diversify on short term , and adds to prices of banking services on long term . 
  but otoh the obvious good side is that it reduces tax-payers ' burden in the event of a bail-out ( bail-in ) . 
  in this case i do n't think you 'll see big effects on monday as the legislation has been on the making since last summer and has been widely reported during the process . 
  so rehn saying it is not really new here . 
  the directive is not yet ready as there 's still some details under work , which will take perhaps some more months . 
  apparently somebody has been covering their tracks in bank of cyprus :  the cyprus mail website says information provided by bank of cyprus was incomplete and data-deleting software was found on some computers there . 
  there were significant gaps in computer records for the period 2007-2010 . 
  it is not yet clear whether the wiping of records was accidental or deliberate . 
  there were signs of mass deletion of data . 
  here 's the cyprus mail [ article ] ( http://www.cyprus-mail.com/alvarez-and-marsal/banks-report-raises-questions-says-government/20130406 ) . 
  not really . 
  this directive has been on the making at least since last summer so it 's not actually a new announcement . 
  besides , for example us already has legislation with depositor preference in bank resolution as a part of dodd-frank financial reform act : http://www.roubini.com/briefings/175500.php http://lexicon.ft.com/term?term=bail_in, 
   why is this time different ? 
  are you saying that for example imf , or italy or finland should cancel greek debts just because us reduced german debt 60 yrs ago ? 
  not that i belive greece will eventually pay those debts , to me it seems likely that there would need to be cuts at some point between now and 2022 . 
   if i am not mistaken , draghi mentioned yesterday something about the ecb proposing a solution which did n't involve a haircut during the initial negotiations . 
  i can not imagine such a solution short of eu tax payers paying it all . 
  can you ? 
   it became extremely clear that the imf ( who wanted a 60 % haircut initially ) and a few of the countries wanted a deposit haircut to take place as a condition for accepting a cyprus bailout . 
  cyp participation was a requirement for a bailout , been for some time so not a surprise afaik . 
  as both imf and eurogrp had a condition of ~ 1/3 cyp participation in it 's own bailout ( btw , seems russia agreed ) , then it became only a question of where cyp would raise it 's share . 
  then i do n't know what happened . 
  perhaps we 'll learn about that idiot proposal of general deposit levy in history books or smthng . 
   the ecb has the tools to fix the eurozone crisis , but there is no political will to fix it . 
  sorry , no tools there . 
  ecb can not do what boj did . 
  ecb is very limited by it 's charter . 
  draghi keeps an eye on steady prices and that 's exactly ecb 's main target and charter .
