  well , let 's see then , shall we ? 
  my point # 1 : `` so far the evidence to support that hypothesis are results from genetic studies like neanderthal genome project . '', 
  and you quote an abstract that refers to such genetic studies . 
  me : 1 , you : 0 my point # 2 : `` there 's no direct evidence for the existence of neanderthal-modern hybrids . '', 
  well , does it present a finding of a neanderthal-modern hybrid ? 
  no , indeed your link and quote are not such . 
  me : 2 , you : 0 so , in a repeated nutshell : this finding might be it , if it stands the scrutiny . 
  and that 's exactly what i already said . 
  for further disagreement please do provide a hybrid . 
   i do n't see why you 're baffled , you do n't ? 
  now i 'm a bit more baffled because you do n't see any need to correct your op . 
  as a finn i 'm a bit baffled here . 
  your sole source appears to be a random person 's opinion which is not legislation . 
  begging on the street is not illegal in finland . 
  so perhaps you cite this legislation ? 
  cities in finland do have their local codes , but not their own legislation . 
  strengthengs my previous point , thank you for linking . 
   it 's illegal to beg on the street in finland it 's not . 
  so far the evidence to support that hypothesis are results from genetic studies like neanderthal genome project . 
  there 's no direct evidence for the existence of neanderthal-modern hybrids . 
  this finding might be it , if it stands the scrutiny . 
  i hear there 's value in [ seven legged spiders ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/paying-bills-with-spider-drawings-seven-legged-spider ) . 
  seems you have apples and oranges there by comparing integrated contraction over multiple years ( your examples ) to a single year in a * static * model . 
  in greece the worst contraction was -7.1 % in 2011 , which quite obviously is by far better than the -15 % based on conservative estimate of devaluation in cyprus ( only -40 % mind you ) . 
  now , sudden -15 % in a single year is not only bad it 's * horrible * . 
  and the contraction would n't simply stop in one year as the problems of both devaluation and inflation wo n't simply go away just like that . 
  add to that your suggestion of defaulting at the same time , which would mean that for several years the government would n't have access to the market to borrow from ... 
   i do n't know much about bitcoin , but it seems like an interesting concept . 
  it indeed is . 
   can someone explain to me what 's wrong with it and why people are downvoting this ? 
  tulips . 
  well , if we go by simple correlation then apparently government by fax makes you rich . 
  wonder at which point bitcoin is : http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/151/bubblesandmanias.jpg, 
  and there 's this recently announced intriguing finding from italy : [ first love child of human , neanderthal found ] ( http://news.discovery.com/human/evolution/neanderthal-skeleton-provides-evidence-of-interbreeding-with-humans-130327.htm )  the skeletal remains of an individual living in northern italy 40,000-30 ,000 years ago are believed to be that of a human/neanderthal hybrid , according to a paper in plos one . 
  if further analysis proves the theory correct , the remains belonged to the first known such hybrid , providing direct evidence that humans and neanderthals interbred . 
   i do n't think this is a bad outcome at all . 
  i 'd think -15 % is pretty bad outcome , even when one does not consider the unstoppable inflation in a static model . 
  and that -15 % is just a * conservative * estimate . 
  it 's based on only -40 % devaluation of the new currency leading to +40 % imported petrol prices and +30 % electricity . 
   troika policies will have a much worse result . 
  according to which analysis ? 
   the second analysis does not even consider the possibility of an euro exit . 
  you 're right in that it does not model effects of an euro exit in cyprus - merely states it as unavailable and cites related literature . 
   the first one does , but it mainly says that it is unknown what would happen and that the effects can not be underestimated . 
  unknown ? 
  if you read the modeling part you 'll find their results : * the effect of mild devaluation in just two sectors . 
  combined impact on gdp will be over -8 % , and that does not take account of inflation and other issues such as instability when all issues are put into account a fall up to -15 % as the worst case scenario would be possible , if unlikely * and that 's just effects in two sectors - petrol and electricity . 
  and then there 's the problem of unstoppable inflation among others . 
   i would n't say either of them completely disagree with an euro exit , they just dismissed taking the possibility seriously . 
  based on their modeling their very clear conclusion of an euro exit is : a bad idea , and a bad outcome . 
   probably because they still want to pay their debts . 
  obviously an euro exit would have a default going along with it . 
  to the contrary both advocate restructuring of public debt - even to the point of `` paying off all of government debt in full is insane '' . 
  this analysis does not agree : [ cyprus exit from euro a bad idea ] ( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xue3hcyqrd_ewd7fr-_qiorqvgh8ipv3nro4swjgyag/edit?pli=1#slide=id.gd14b83cd_042 ) neither does this analysis : [ the cyprus debt : perfect crisis and a way forward ] ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2233239 )  abstract : the cyprus crisis is one of the most complex in the eurozone - although in absolute terms it is a minor crisis . 
  an analysis of the ongoing developments from different perspectives leads to the conclusion that we are witnessing a ` perfect crisis ' at the confluence of sovereign debt and banking crisis together with debt overhang of business and households and a severe decline of competitiveness . 
  as a result cy has amassed a large external debt that can not be repaid , no matter what fraction of the country 's real domestic economic output is appropriated through austerity measures . 
  hence , fiscal austerity leads to deflationary stagnation and alone does not work . 
  ** we advocate a policy response that addresses multiple dimensions of the problem with policy options of ( 1 ) austerity deleveraging , ( 2 ) structural reforms , ( 3 ) financial innovations , ( 4 ) partial privatizations and ( 5 ) debt restructuring . 
  ** these options are drawn from lessons of what worked well , and what not , in crises of other countries and these lessons are summarized in lieu of conclusions . 
  it seems likely that cyprus will need restructuring of public debt . 
  soon . 
  and cyprus will likely need a second bailout package . 
  cyprus gov 's current foreign debt consists mostly ( 80 % ) of short term loans which are due 2013-15 . 
  the previous government borrowed in short term to cover gov expenses , and to avoid making reforms and budget cuts . 
  at least those short term loans will likely need to be restructured preferably soon ( russia 's loan was already extended ) . 
   what ? 
  are you saying it is impossible for the council to a ) change its position ? 
  b ) have , as a guide to only implement programs that they can afford ? 
  no , that is not what i 'm saying . 
   sweden has managed to balance it budget for over a decade , as well as myriads of other countries/organisations/states / counties/companies/regions etc. 
  are you saying it can not be done ? 
  no , that is not what i 'm saying . 
  and i already told you how it 's about balancing . 
  with your continuous loaded questions and misinformed personal interpretations i see you simply insist on to adding your own special narrative on otherwise rather straightforward situation . 
  you asked for information . 
  you have been informed - with links to relevant sources and all . 
  so i 'll just bail out right here . 
   or , are you saying that it is completely out of eu 's hands ? 
  i already explained in my first post that it was the council 's decision - the council being the government executives of member states - and how it was already known that it would not cover the actual commitments . 
  ie the executives of national governments decided not to cover commitments with payments . 
   that it was by accident this happened , that they in no way could foresee this ? 
  who , when and how should have foreseen the council 's position ? 
  and how should the spending be planned : according to commitments or according to foresight of the position the national executives might take in the future ? 
  the eu is not `` asking someone else to cover for [ their ] mistakes '' here . 
   while it is so clear that it is the eu that have messed up . 
  please elaborate ? 
   also , the council have no former legislative power ( we are talking about the european council , right ? 
  ) , so the ep should say no , and send it back . 
  the council is a colloquialism for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_ministers_%28european_union%29 here 's a basic description of the procedure : [ how is the budget decided ? 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/management/deciding/decide_en.cfm )  i would also say it is important that the council does n't get this through , how on earth will then they learn ? 
  the council is just as wise as the national governments represented there , so prepare to see more of the narrative how a national government `` will fight an eu demand '' . 
   so , the problem should then be by asking those countries who has not paid , to pay , or refuse to give those countries anything , until they pay.why are n't they doing that instead ? 
  it 's not about single countries falling behind in their payments , like i already said it 's about the council and their decisions . 
  also : [ ` we did not have loans written off ' ] ( http://www.cyprus-mail.com/banking-sector/we-did-not-have-loans-written/20130330 ) * the list , published in greece , contains the names of former and current mps as well as other prominent individuals , including former president george vassiliou . 
   so , obviously the eu has adopted programs that they can not afford . 
  not to be obtuse , but who is responsible for that ? 
  i mean , it is the first thing one should look at - can we do this ? 
  the programs are based on budgetary commitments , which on turn are covered by actual payments to the budget . 
  now the situation is that the payments do not meet the commitments . 
  you could start by looking at the council and it 's decisions during last years ( for more information see the link in my previous post ) .
