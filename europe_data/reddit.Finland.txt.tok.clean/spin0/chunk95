   but that is in no way a guarantee that it will not happen again . 
  it is n't . 
  that 's why the parliament has been raising a stink about it regarding the mff 2014-20 too . 
  [ long-term eu budget negotiations : ep sets out its stance ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130312ipr06440/html/long-term-eu-budget-negotiations-ep-sets-out-its-stance ) * the resolution highlights the growing problem of payment shortfalls , which prevent bills being paid and jeopardize eu programmes . 
  last year 's shortfalls meant that several important eu programmes , such as erasmus , the research framework programme and the social fund ran out of funds early in the year . 
  * * parliament insists that the issue of unpaid bills from 2012 must be settled before concluding the multiannual financial framework ( mff ) negotiations , as agreed in last year 's budget talks . 
  parliament also wants a political undertaking from the council that all bills falling due in 2013 will be paid in 2013 , so as to avoid `` rolling over '' a deficit into the new mff . 
  the eu can not legally run a deficit . 
  *  countries have paid , countries have met their commitments . 
  well , there 's problem . 
  countries have made commitments but not paid for all those commitments . 
  now it 's 2013 , the last year of mff 2007-13 and budgetary commitments should be met with actual payments . 
  but with the council it seems to be like pulling teeth ( see their decisions jul and dec 2012 ) . 
   a lot of big deposits at smaller banks ( with probably around 99.9 % russian money ) do n't take any haircut ... and there 's no reason why they should as the banks have not failed . 
   you do n't want to be complicit in lies and theft . 
  there 's no theft happening - when a business fails there will be inevitable losses . 
  but in this case at least the small insured deposists are guaranteed in a failed bank . 
  it 's the uninsured deposits that will take a haircut and share & bondholders will also take losses . 
  the bail-in in cyprus is to guarantee at least the small insured deposits . 
  it 's the big uninsured deposits that take the haircut ( plus shares and bonds ) . 
  and if the `` wealthy investors '' have already taken their money out it 's not german people 's fault . 
   i would like to know the reason for why the eu can not pay its bills ? 
  because there 's not enough money to cover all the budgeted and completed programs from 2012 . 
  those commitments can not be paid without funding in form of payments . 
  that was the original reason they were rolled over to 2013 budget . 
  but the austerity guys in the council thought that it would be beneficial to make also 2013 budget payments too small to cover that . 
   who is responsible for this ? 
  [ ** council ** adopts its position on the 2013 eu budget ] ( http://consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-adopts-its-position-on-the-2013-eu-budget?lang=en ) * on 24 july the council adopted its position on the draft eu budget for 2013 . 
  the ministers agreed that the increase in payments should not be higher than 2.79 % compared to the 2012 budget . 
  * * in absolute figures , the council position amounts to 132.70 billion euro in payments ( i.e. 
  actual amounts that could be paid out in 2013 ) and 149.78 billion euro in commitments ( i.e. 
  promises to spend money , which do not necessarily have to be paid out in 2013 , but can be spread over several financial years ) . 
  * * it constitutes an increase of 3.61 billion euro in payments and 1.88 billion euro in commitments compared to the 2012 budget , but a decrease of 5.23 billion euro and 1.15 billion euro respectively if compared to the commission 's proposal for the 2013 budget . 
  * then it was already known that the payments would not be enough . 
  and already in oct 2012 the commission proposed amendments : [ amending eu budget for europe 's students , scientists , ngos ' , businesses and regions ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201210231543 ) * the commission has adopted today an amending budget to enable it to meet its legal obligations towards beneficiaries of eu funds . 
  this is in line with the joint statement the council and the european parliament adopted the day the eu budget for 2012 was adopted inviting the commission to request additional money `` in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure '' . 
  * and in oct 2012 the parliament 's position was : [ eu budget 2013 : avoid payments shortfalls and invest in growth and jobs ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20121019ipr54020/html/eu-budget-2013-avoid-payments-shortfalls-and-invest-in-growth-and-jobs ) * to enable the eu to pay its bills in 2013 , council cuts in the european commission 's budget proposal must be reversed , said parliament in a vote on tuesday . 
  reinstating funding for payments in 2013 would help to protect popular eu programmes , such as erasmus mundus and the social fund , against funding shortfalls like those that disrupted them this year . 
  * the 2013 budget was adopted dec 2012 and it was quite clear that the budgeted payments would not be enough and amendments would be needed : [ eu budget 2013 adopted : statement by commissioner for financial programming and budget janusz lewandowski ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201212130801 ) * `` however i am concerned that the approved budget will in all likelihood not be sufficient to pay the incoming bills . 
  the adopted budget is $ 5 billion below what the commission estimates necessary for 2013 , and another $ 3 billion remain outstanding from amending budget 6 in 2012 . 
  this means that the pressure on the 2013 eu budget will be tremendous . 
  there is a serious risk that we will run out of funds early in the course of next year . 
  i am concerned that by systematically cutting the commission 's estimates , the council transforms the eu annual budget in a budget for 9 to 10 months ; last year we ran out of cash to pay all the claims in november , this year was in october and next year i expect this to happen even earlier . 
  * * i can only hope that , building on the amending budget agreed this year , both the council and the parliament will honour the spirit of the joint statements in which they ask the commission to initiate any necessary action according to the treaty and , in particular , to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2013 budget prove insufficient to cover expenditure '' . 
  * and now we are here : [ eu budget 2013 : more funding needed to cover unpaid claims from 2012 ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-291_en.htm?locale=en ) more info on developments here : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201303191223  what is being done to correct it ? 
  the budget is being amended to cover both unpaid expences from 2012 and expenses in 2013 ( e.g. 
  croatia joining needs about 1.1 bn more ) . 
   i actually find it rather extraordinary that the eu apparently are so bad a budgeting , that they need extra money all of a sudden . 
  not `` all of sudden '' . 
   what more - i am afraid that if they get extra money now , it will become a `` habit '' and the eu will not longer care to balance its budget ( which they are supposed to do , but apparently do n't do ) . 
  the amendmends * are * about balancing the budget : payments should meet the commitments . 
  postponing the payments indefinitely does not work . 
  ( whoa , should n't have swinged that claymore of compensation - april 1st ... ), 
   the rule in question is that a euro country must n't have a yearly budget deficit higher than 3 % of its gdp . 
  if that 's the criteria then actually the first to break that rule was portugal . 
  in 1999 portugal had a budget deficit of -3.1 % and in 2000 -3.3 % . 
  then in 2001 four countries broke the rule : germany ( -3.1 % ) , italy ( -3.1 % ) , greece ( -4.5 % ) and portugal ( -4.8 % ) . 
  see this [ eurostat data ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/data/main_tables ) for the first countries to break it : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i0tmvup ), 
   of course , but let us not forget that a `` northern '' nation broke the rules first - germany . 
  what was it that germany was first to do ? 
  indeed . 
  we pay . 
  as we live on this planet , and the dysfunctional stuff is our invention , then we are the ones to pay for it . 
  with imaginary stuff . 
  obviously . 
  that time he was keenly objective , just as is common with brits . 
  the world never actually worked before . 
  not that it works these days , but did n't work before either . 
  no normalcy there to return to but dysfunctionality as usual . 
  yeah , but then again pretty much anyone who said we 're really up shit creek would have made an accurate assessment . 
   what they 're saying is some heavy shit indeed . 
  and make no mistake about it , they 're all saying it . 
  and mean it too . 
  unless some special circumstances apply . 
  but they mean it . 
  seriously mean . 
  really . 
  this time , and for now on . 
  perhaps . 
  in stead of bail-outs it 's gon na be bail-ins . 
  i guess it 's because : 1 . 
  no funds to do otherwise . 
  political support lacking even if funds were available . 
  the voting public ( at least in those countries still with some credit left ) is fed up with bail-outs . 
  us northeners had no sympathy for cypriots , despite how small a sum it actually was . 
  it 's the morally ` right thing to do ' - ants vs. grasshoppers and all that imagination stuff . 
  never saw the eurogroup , the commission and the parliament climb on the same high horse like that . 
  so maybe this time they mean it , or it 's just a special occasion . 
   if an obnoxious catchphrase is n't clever the first time , it is n't clever the second or third time either . 
  clever . 
  i feel so bad for you guys . 
  about what happened . 
  and about what we did . 
  and especially what 's going to happen . 
  i try to insist it was bound to happen . 
  that it was all self-inflicted , a long path of multiple wrong turns . 
  i could say i 'm sorry , but i ca n't . 
  i 'm not sorry . 
  but i wish i could help . 
  please think of questions about society when you learn to can into maths , you idiot .
