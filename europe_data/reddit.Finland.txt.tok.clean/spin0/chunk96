  good day . 
  end of communication . 
  his writings has become more and more like personal letters about him : never mind being consistent or even knowledgeable , it 's not even my opinion that 's important here - but me . 
  needs cats . 
  cheers , now we know . 
   ( the article ( and your numbers ) explicitly state that less than 10 % of the population commits 40 % of the rapes . ), 
  you can not into simple maths . 
  good day , sir . 
   it seems they are raping 4 times more than average . 
  and you can not see the sillyness in that . 
   i am just going off the numbers spin0 posted since the mods decided to censor the comments they are yellow paper 's numbers which i copied , please do not put them onto me . 
  not my numbers . 
  the scary truth is that he actually was telling the scary truth . 
  and that truth is pretty heavy shit indeed . 
  and now it 's been confirmed by the european commission and the european parliament . 
  brace yourselves . 
  gon na be a bit rough ride . 
  oh , carl sagan you so brave . 
  aaand the circlejerk of not-so-bright-individuals-among-us is now full . 
  well good luck with that , idiot . 
  well go ahead then . 
  and good riddance with your chosen diet . 
  what do you mean , like we 'd eat pizza in finland ? 
  never . 
  resident racists like that . 
  cockoo-clocks work not like others , but despite the loose gears they 're somewhat predictable . 
  not just the commission saying this . 
  yesterday it was the eurogroup . 
  today it was first the ec and then the european parliament , see here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1b1mtc/the_european_parliament_will_demand_that_big/ looks like we 're into a rough ride . 
  brace yourselves . 
  thanks . 
  according to those numbers your headline is still wrong . 
  ah you ninjaed , me too then : well , apparently with playing the pre-emptive victim card i see you 've already noticed that you were wrong from the beginning . 
  well then show the actual numbers . 
  , says our resident troll who 's not even finnish . 
  which does not correspond to the breakdown . 
  it 's a yellow paper but here 's it 's figures : convicted of rape in 2010 danes 32 iraqis and their descendants 7 iranians and their descendants 4 turks and descendants 4 lebanese and descendants 3 somalis and descendants 2 afghans and descendants 2 obviously not `` half of rapists '' . 
  op can not into simple math . 
  but then again , it 's not truth he 's going after anyway ... 
  no prob , and no need to be sorry at all . 
  and besides , i did like the video when it appeared  it 's just that finland has not really been hiding it 's hard stance , and it even has gained a reasonable amount of international attention through the recent years . 
  the most recent example being demonstrations around finnish consulate in cyprus . 
  seems that the writer of the article is not well informed , or perhaps intentionally forgets some things just to support his case . 
  thanks . 
  this is not just about cyprus . 
  if the policy really is bail-ins only for now on , then the implication is that it would concern other countries too - e.g. 
  spain , italy etc. . . kinda big thing that outspoken policy . 
  a game changer so to speak . 
  based on statements it certainly looks as it 's gon na be all bail-ins now on , and apparently they mean it this time . 
  first [ eurogroup head dijsselbloem ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/uk-eurogroup-cyprus-dijsselbloem-idukbre92o0il20130325 ) , then [ the european commission ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/26/eurozone-crisis-cyprus-banks#block-51518beab5795d794abf44ba ) and now the ep . 
  do n't know what to make of it . 
  honestly i 'm a bit shocked as apparently the markets are . 
  insights please ? 
  [ `` deposits ? 
  what deposits ? 
  what are these ` deposits ' you 're talking about ? 
  '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/eurozone-cyprus-muddle-idusl5n0cg13920130325 )  the two banks at the centre of the crisis - cyprus popular bank , also known as laiki , and bank of cyprus - have units in london which remained open throughout the week and placed no limits on withdrawals . 
  bank of cyprus also owns 80 percent of russia 's uniastrum bank , which put no restrictions on withdrawals in russia . 
  russians were among cypriot banks ' largest depositors . 
   while ordinary cypriots queued at atm machines to withdraw a few hundred euros as credit card transactions stopped , other depositors used an array of techniques to access their money . 
   companies that had to meet margin calls to avoid defaulting on deals were granted funds . 
  transfers for trade in humanitarian products , medicines and jet fuel were allowed . 
   ...  big depositors , including wealthy russians and britons , whom the cypriot president had sought to shield from a levy of any more than 10 percent on their holdings , will end up being far more severely burned - * if their money is still there * . 
  lem me guess : google translate ? 
  right , [ `` these are not the bailout templates you were looking for . 
  '' ] ( http://pawelmorski.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/eurogroup-what-happened-today/ ), 
  considering the circumstances this deal looks quite sane , workable and sustainable . 
  was probably the best option , as there has been no good options left . 
  but it will hurt badly . 
  here 's the estimated deposits in laiki ( popular ) bank and bank of cyprus : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uyxsaym ), 
  here 's an icelandic view : [ can cyprus do an icesave ? 
  the short answer is `` no . '' ] ( http://uti.is/2013/03/can-cyprus-do-an-icesave/ ), 
  yes . 
  russia 's stance has been [ since january ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/uk-eurozone-cyprus-russia-idukbre90r08120130128 ) that they might be willing to help only if eu and cyprus first agree to carry the biggest burden of the bailout . 
  now the agreement is there , so talks with russia may continue . 
  hopefully russia agrees to give at least an extension to it 's current loan of $ 2.5 bn , and perhaps some relief on interest payments . 
  or they might consider the planned haircuts to russian deposits as their contribution to the package and decline further help . 
  or something else with strings attached . 
  stopping ela . 
  ~ ~ ela ~ ~ -  certain disaster . 
  possibly . 
  but that insistence to save those two banks was the reason for the last week 's insane proposal of the general levy for all deposits in all banks : even in good banks , and including the insured deposits . 
  not a good way to maintain confidence . 
  and now after today 's negotiations it appears that the levy/haircut will concern only the troubled laiki and boc , and it will be heavy on big uninsured deposits only . 
  this was the proposal cyp prez rejected last week , but apparently has just now agreed to . 
  in this case him resigning would have meant the ultimate worst case scenario for his country . 
  a bomb exploded in bank of cyprus in limassol . 
  people are really pissed . 
   our industrial sector was decimated back in the late 60s , 70s and 80s and we rely too heavily on our financial services sector . 
  according to uk office of national statistics , [ united kingdom national accounts , 2011 edition ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/united-kingdom-national-accounts/2011-edition/index.html ) : uk gdp : # 1 458 452 million of which financial corporations : # 52 898 million which makes financial sector about 3.6 % of uk 's gdp . 
  exports of various services according to office of national statistics ( [ link ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/itis/international-trade-in-services/2011/stb-itis-2011.html#tab-trade-in-services-products--industry-analysis ) ) : 1 . 
  professional , scientific and technical - # 28,772 million 1 . 
  information & communication - # 21,799 million 1 . 
  wholesale/retail - # 14,176 million 1 . 
  financial and insurance - # 13,238 million which makes financial sector together with insurance # 4 export among services . 
  i do n't know how that compares with manufacturing and export of goods , but i would n't say uk relys too heavily on it 's financial services sector . 
  makes me wonder what kind of leader he actually is . 
  as an elected president he 's supposed to lead , not abandon post when things get rough . 
  according to [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/24/eurozone-cyprus-anastasiades-idusl5n0cg11320130324 ) it apparently was about bank of cyprus : * anastasiades objected to a proposal that two cypriot banks be shut down * why is he ready to do that over boc ? 
  he seems to be affixed to the idea that boc be saved at all costs - even by a general deposit levy or with pension funds ...
