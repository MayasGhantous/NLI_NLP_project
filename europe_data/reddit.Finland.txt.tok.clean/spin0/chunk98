  edit : yep , looks more and more like it : [ euro finance heads said to weigh closing two cyprus banks ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-21/euro-area-said-to-weigh-closing-two-cyprus-banks-asset-freeze.html ) so it 's back to square one . 
  except it 's not the same square one any more - it 's worse . 
  what a waste of time this week has been . 
  esa 's sciops and mission sites have different looks and functions compared to the esa 's main site , which is more directed to the popular audience . 
  i also like the mission sites more , the many links are readily available and its logical and easy to find and access relevant data there . 
  but i can see why they do n't use that scheme in the main site : it might be confusing and difficult to use to the popular audience . 
  bad astronomer phil plait 's take on the new results : [ the universe is 13.82 billion years old ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/03/21/age_of_the_universe_planck_results_show_universe_is_13_82_billion_years.html )  i still hear some people say that science takes the wonder out of life . 
  those people are utterly and completely wrong . 
  science takes us to the wonder . 
   if they do n't have to pay an extra 8 % / year on bonds ( last source i found said that their rate was 11 % ) fortunately not . 
  thanks to debt relief greece 's interest payments are low . 
  they 're below eurozone average , and will be kept low for years to come . 
  [ see this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zyoo1ar.png )  it 's high bond yields that 's strangling them now , not a lack of growth . 
  the loans issued by greece loan facility and efsf have very low interests . 
  in fact they are below market funding costs of some euro countries , meaning those countries are effectively making fiscal transfers to greece . 
  please see the latest imf report on greece , it 's very informative even when skimmed : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr1320.pdf * the margin over 3-month euribor on the $ 53 billion in debt to the greece loan facility ( glf ) was reduced from 150bps to 50ps , and the 10bps operating fee on efsf lending was eliminated . 
  the glf reduction brings it below the market funding cost of some euro area member states , implying an effective fiscal transfer from countries facing larger effective sovereign borrowing spreads . 
  the change in borrowing terms is estimated to alleviate the debt burden over time achieving a cumulative debt reduction by 2020 of approximately 2.6 percentage points of gdp .

  do n't know as have n't read the paper yet surprising findings : * cmb fluctuations not exactly what standard model predicted * asymmetry of temperatures in different parts of sky * large cold spot  `` with the most accurate and detailed maps of the microwave sky ever made , planck is painting a new picture of the universe that is pushing us to the limits of understanding current cosmological theories , '' says jan tauber , esa 's planck project scientist . 
  `` we see an almost perfect fit to the standard model of cosmology , but with intriguing features that force us to rethink some of our basic assumptions . 
  `` this is the beginning of a new journey and we expect that our continued analysis of planck data will help shed light on this conundrum . '' got ta love science : groundbreaking new findings open up new questions . 
  ` perfect ' in the sense that the observation mostly agrees with the theory and standard model ( [ lambda-cdm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lcdm_model ) ) . 
  ` almost ' because some of the new findings are not predicted by the standard model . 
  which is very exciting as it points to new physics . 
   russians and eu will both have a role to play . 
  very likely . 
  earlier russia 's position has been that they are ready to help if certain conditions are met , and if eu and cyprus carry the biggest burden of the bailout . 
  this from january : [ russia 's medvedev : help for cyprus only if conditions met ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/uk-eurozone-cyprus-russia-idukbre90r08120130128 ) * `` we think the main burden to solve these problems should be taken on by cyprus and the eu states , '' medvedev told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview held on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . 
  * * `` but we are not refusing to help under certain conditions . 
  the conditions must be agreed first . 
  before that , there can be no money from us , '' he added , adding that russia had already given cyprus a $ 2.5 billion ( 1.5 billion pounds ) loan in 2011 . 
  fwiw : when i was a kid to me it was an illustrative story about being forward thinking and facing the consequences if you 're not .

   1 ) ... 2 ) ... 3 ) ... 4 ) [ you get unification , we get the euro ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/351531-you-get-unification-we-get-euro ), 
  there it is said one more time , and very clearly this time :  regarding the one off levy on deposits below 100.000 $ : the commission made it clear in the eurogroup before the vote in the cypriot parliament , that an alternative solution respecting the financing parameters would be acceptable , preferably without a levy on deposits below 100.000 $ . 
  the cypriot authorities did not accept such an alternative scenario . 
  this article , perhaps aggravating in tone , has some points about blaming others unduely : [ the crisis ? 
  merkel 's fault , of course !, 
  ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/3560861-crisis-merkel-s-fault-course ),

  possibly . 
  but the bill will still need the majority vote in the parliament . 
  could happen with current parliament but not by all means certain . 
  anyway , @ 17:45 it has gained already over 72000 signatures . 
  wow !, 
   let me try once more . 
  the eurozone did not demand to put a tax on small savings . 
  all that was agreed in the meeting last friday was the total amount ( $ 5.8 bn ) . 
  not the way it 's collected from different deposits and how it 's split between them . 
  that is and was for cyprus to decide . 
  so lets just agree to disagree there . 
  relevant image on / r/historyporn : [ a woman hitting a skinhead with her handbag , sweden , 1985 . 
  the woman was reportedly a concentration camp survivor . 
  [ 1024x768 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/historyporn/comments/1akk1p/a_woman_hitting_a_skinhead_with_her_handbag/ ), 
   they did reach a political agreement . 
  and nowhere in that agreement is demanded that cyprus 's government should tax the small deposits . 
  known since friday and was further reiterated and made even more clear on monday . 
  the eurozone has not and does not demand that . 
  it is for cyprus 's government to decide . 
   it was `` an offer they could n't refuse '' yes , in a way . 
  but there were some options , for example letting the two biggest problem banks fail , and guarantee the small deposits in them while cutting the big ones by 30-40 % . 
   in the end , the turd will be polished but its core will remain the same . 
  turd it indeed is and now it 's in the fan . 
  they agreed upon : * $ 9 bn from the eurozone * $ 1 bn from the imf the remaining $ 9.7 bn from cyprus as : * 1 bn from tax on interest income * 1.4 bn from junior bonds * 1.5 bn from privatizations , asset swaps etc * 5.8 bn from tax on deposits on friday they did not make a pact on how cyprus should implement the levy on deposits . 
  cyprus needs to raise the needed $ 5.8 bn but how to split it between small and big deposits is theirs to decide . 
  ninjaed : afaik a levy of 15 % on deposits bigger than $ 100 000 would meet the $ 5.8 bn target . 
  perhaps it has been a clusterfuck of a meeting last friday as people present do n't know what has been agreed upon and how . 
  but after reading that linked statement it should now be very clear that the eurogroup is not demanding for a levy on small savings ( nor did demand such in the statement last friday ) . 
  then again , here 's [ statement by the eurogroup president on cyprus ] ( http://eurozone.europa.eu/newsroom/news/2013/03/peg-statement-cyprus-18-03-13/ )  ** the eurogroup continues to be of the view that small depositors should be treated differently from large depositors and reaffirms the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below eur 100.000 . 
  ** the cypriot authorities will introduce more progressivity in the one-off levy compared to what was agreed on 16 march , provided that it continues yielding the targeted reduction of the financing envelope and , hence , not impact the overall amount of financial assistance up to eur 10bn . 
  seems that we have two different versions about this in the media . 
  but the eurogroup is actually asking cyprus to leave the small savings alone . 
   i could n't believe it . 
  `` actually , '' i explained , `` the civil war was about states ' rights , not slavery . '', 
  actually , i found this article rather interesting in the context of that anecdote : [ the south still lies about the civil war ] ( http://www.salon.com/2013/03/16/the_south_still_lies_about_the_civil_war/ ) * in an ongoing revisionist history effort , southern schools and churches still pretend the war was n't about slavery *, 
  according to [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f890566a-8f24-11e2-a39b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2nplif3vp ) that was the plan at some point , but :  backed into a corner , the only thing the cypriots could do was mitigate the damage . 
  several officials suggested putting all of the burden on deposits over $ 100,000 . 
  berlin was agnostic about where the axe fell . 
  but cypriot officials , with the backing of the commission , felt anything over 10 per cent would appear so onerous that it would make the situation even worse . 
  `` the cypriot president did not want to agree to a levy higher than 10 per cent , '' said one top negotiator . 
  `` people were joking that he has only rich friends . '' once that limit was placed on the top rate , it became simple maths . 
  negotiators agreed to count $ 1.4 bn in privatisation receipts and new income from an increased corporate tax -- which would go from 10 to 12.5 per cent -- towards the cypriot contribution , bringing the total needed from the deposits to $ 5.8 bn . 
  with a top rate of 9.9 per cent , the lower rate fell in at 6.75 per cent . 
  the eu and imf would lend nicosia $ 10bn .
