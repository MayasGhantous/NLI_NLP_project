  interesting questions , but to establish any of those claims you should make a cross comparison at least between agricultural area & produce , cap received , produce in question , and related samples exceeding the mrls . 
  would be interesting to see that done . 
  a very good question . 
  and then see [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/caosbdm.jpg ) and compare them both to the tables in this appendix : http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/3130ax3.pdf imho the maps in the report are not of very high quality . 
  but then again i 'm not an expert and perhaps i am missing something . 
  i posted this in order to stir discussion and hopefully further analysis on the report .

   actually you could n't even get a guy to stand beside the door and tell you how much it 's going to cost to fix it for 100 euros . 
  a while ago so in helsinki asked for estimates for a new bathroom door . 
  the best offer was 110 $ with a new door installed . 
  nvm i got a new door from bauhaus with 30 $ . 
  anyway , imo it 's bit of a hyperbole to hold fixing a door as an example of corruption in society . 
  i mean , if * that * is enough to make the headlines then i think we are doing pretty well here in finland . 
  was just joking . 
  you know you have a prevalent corruption problem when fixing a door ( net worth ~ 100 $ ) makes the headlines . 
  but yeah , her conduct was indeed shameful .

  i think a pretty good compromise would be to grow 2013 ceilings a bit to address the payment shortfalls issues in the current budget , to add flexibility to the 2014-20 budget while keeping the commitment ceilings , and to settle a date when the budget will be reopened for possible adjustments to reflect economic developments .

  when internet activists use a mass mailer to send hundreds of thousands similar canned emails to all 750 meps , then what should happen to them ? 
  should all the canned emails be cherished in every meps inbox turned into a mess ? 
  should every mep read every single one of them ? 
  or should they perhaps be all read aloud in the plenary ? 
  what would you do with thousands of similar emails in your inbox ? 
  i know i would delete them , because it would be of no use to read them all nor would i have the time for that . 
  after a vast number of similar emails addressed to all meps in a short time , ep 's email system 's automatic spam filtering kicked in and redirected the emails . 
  they were not deleted . 
  so if someone wants to read hudreds of thousands similar emails they are still there .

  the non binding resolution on eliminating gender stereotypes in the eu was adopted by 368 votes to 159 , with 98 abstentions .

  now , after the ( very good ) speech by simon perez , voting resumes in the european parliament . 
  live here : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/plenary/video?date=12-03-2013 first some boring things like radioactivity in drinking water , economic and budgetary surveillance of member states , european venture capital funds etc before finally getting into the overblownly delicious issue of pron . 
  btw , does anyone know what was pirate party 's stance and vote on the issue of online consumer dispute resolution ? 
  i missed that vote , and all i 'm able to find with google is about pron . 
  why so serious ? 
  another informative source : library of the european parliament - [ reform of the common agricultural policy ] ( http://libraryeuroparl.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/reform-of-the-common-agricultural-policy/ ), 
   a ban on pornography had previously been discussed in iceland , where it was allegedly aimed at protecting children from online threats . 
  now , the trend has spread to the eu . 
  eu `` banned pron '' before it was cool in iceland . 
  in eu it 's in a resolution from 1997 . 
  official journal of the european communities , [ c304 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:c:1997:304:full:en:pdf ) , 6.10.1997 , pg 60 - resolution on discrimination against women in advertising * `` calls for statutory measures to prevent any form of pornoghaphy in the media and in advertising and for a ban on advertising for pornographic products and sex tourism '' * that is the thing that the recent report and the resolution refes to . 
  despite the technically poor phrasing it actually refers to porn in advertising . 
  dey took our pron already in 1997 . :p,

  got ta say this porn-thing has gotten blown out of proportion as there are quite many important issues on vote today such as energy infrastructure , consumer protection , monitoring ghg emissions , monitoring budgetary plans of member states etc.

  [ dennis the constitutional peasant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dootka0agi0 ), 
  the article fails to mention that the emails were canned messages sent to all 750 meps at once with a mass mailing system ( = spam ) set up by pirate party . 
  eventually ep 's email system automatically identified those hundreds of thousands identical emails as spam and started to treat them accordingly . 
  i have no problem if an organization blocks spam as it does disrupt actual work when it snowballs into hundreds of similar messages per inbox . 
  so perhaps there are better ways for constituents , citizens and internet activists to voice their opinion than mass mailing copious canned messages to all mep 's - such as taking a few minutes to write a personal message to your own mep . 
  because i think that the spamming is ruining it for us all . 
  for example i did not receive an answer from my mep until i emailed her again two days later - she told that her inbox had been a mess , thanks to concerned internet activists . 
  yeah , but he killed the guy who killed hitler . 
  one metric to measure research output is to count scientific publications . 
  iirc this made rounds in reddit : [ neil degrasse tyson on the decline of scientific research in america ] ( http://www.openculture.com/2012/01/neil_degrasse_tyson_on_the_decline_of_scientific_research_in_america.html ) and it contained this measure of publications ( from 2006 ) : http://sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/posters/worldmapper_map205_ver5.pdf [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zxew0zh.jpg ) but then again perhaps a better metric would be to count not only papers but also citations to account for their actual impact . 
   if a top christian cleric like the pope or an archbishop declares something like this , it 's not just an opinion . 
  but she 's * not * the pope , and not a cleric , * she 's an american writer * . 
  and i provided an actual source where an actual indonesian top cleric says quite the opposite than she did on her opinion piece . 
   but whatever , it 's easy to find [ 1 ] other sources claiming the same thing . 
  yes , it 's quite easy to find all kinds of claims by googling . 
  that claim in your link is wrong : fgm does not mean `` partial or total removal of external genitalia '' . 
  only some of the forms of fgm involves such practices e.g. 
  in sudan and egypt . 
  using blanket statements and wide brushes on a complex issue with a lot of variation is not helpful in charting the reality . 
   [ 2 ] it 's obvious that fgm has this effect . 
  yes , the most severe forms of fgm do have adverse effects on female sexual stimulus , though does not prevent orgasms as per the study i linked earlier . 
  the study mentioned in your link included most severe forms of fgm ( pharaotic ) and [ confirms the adverse effects ] ( http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/sexual-function-in-women-with-female-genital-mutilation-jhwh1jyz6b ) . 
  but that study is not without problems in it 's methodology : for some reason the women were not clinically studied to determine what kind of fgm they actually had experienced . 
  instead the women self-reported their fgm in a questionnaire as : `` phaaroni '' 42 % , `` none phaaroni '' 41 % , `` unknown '' 17 % . 
   with so many millions suffering , it 's not a surprise to anyone . 
  how many millions are suffering from these most severe forms of fgm ( pharaotic ) and where ? 
   so at best it 's a consequence they do n't give a shit about . 
  why ? 
  because the women have n't lost anything important . 
  which brings us back to my point . 
  i do get your point .
