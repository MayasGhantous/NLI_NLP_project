  i myself use both karelian and savonian words and expressions in my everyday speech . 
  there are distinct stereotypes associated with the different dialects . 
  savonian dialect : the funny dialect . 
  people who speak the savonian dialect are usually depicted as sly but easygoing and mellow . 
  karelian dialect : speakers are seen as talkative ( as in machine-gun speed talkative ) , happy and bubbly . 
  tavastian dialects : speakers are depicted as quiet , grumpy and ... well , sort of slow-witted . 
  ostrobothnian dialects : the macho dialect . 
  speakers are depicted as hard-core , no-fucks-given people . 
  always ready for a good knife fight etc. 
  cue the dudesons . 
  southwestern dialects : speakers are depicted as sort of oddballs and as avoiding the issue at hand . 
  ( cheers ! ), 
  ( hi to your dangly ones ! '' ), 
  you can also use `` hep ! '', 
  if you are on a company dinner with the old boys and/or belong to the old land aristocracy . 
  the commitments !, 
  love that movie !, 
  there are lots of articles for the english-speaking counterparts , ` sovereign citizens/freemen of the land ' . 
  also , lots of hilarious videos of them trying their `` get-out-of-jail-free '' cards with police officers and judges . 
  needless to say , they do n't exactly succeed .

  you have to put your birch whisk into the freezer in july so you can thaw it in december and beat yourself with it in the christmas sauna . 
  you buy wine and spirits from a government store . 
  yep , no shoes inside . 
  yep , finland was not a colony of sweden , but a genuine part of sweden proper . 
  we were the ` eastern provinces ' of the realm . 
  english ( my first foreign language ) , swedish ( my second ` foreign ' language , the other official language of finland ) , german ( my third foreign language ) . 
  english is the one i can use fluently , because i 've had constant exposure to it since my childhood . 
  my swedish and especially german skills suck - i can decipher a general idea of a news article written in these languages , but do n't expect me to produce a sentence on the fly . 
  they are clean and stocked well with toilet paper and paper hand towels , although some may be a bit run down ( not renovated in ages ) . 
  football ( 130 700 licensed players , about 400 000 amateur players ) ice hockey ( 73 000 licensed , over 200 000 amateurs ) floorball ( 53 000 licensed , over 350 000 amateurs ) source : this article from 2016 http://www.lansivayla.fi/artikkeli/369185-jalkapallolla-eniten-harrastajia-se-lyo-latkan-hiihto-on-alamaessa, 
  i do n't know much about it . 
  it kind of flies under the radar , news-wise . 
  the basque movement is probably the most known one in finland , but mainly because of news about the past actions of eta . 
  teenage boys who still ca n't get a driver 's license usually drive and mod mopeds . 
  lately , moped cars ( ` light quadricycles ' ) have gained popularity among the younger generations . 
  barcelona opening was really something different at that time . 
  felt really fresh and different . 
  it 's ok i guess , but i 'm not a big fan of it really . 
  tbh , there are far worse fates than to become a swede ... 
  if erdogan wants bombs to drop on istanbul and ankara , then sure , please try . 
  i love civilization games . 
  i 've clocked so many hours on civ v. half-life 2 is one of my all-time favourites , as was the first half-life . 
  i also like call of duty games and tales of maj ` eyal ( tome4 ) . 
  i go barefoot , even in winter . 
  olla kusessa = to be in the piss, 
  easy . 
  sweden vs. finland , because of either ice hockey or maaottelu/finnkampen . 
  not bunkers , but i remember playing around in some finnish civil war era trenches in my childhood . 
  district heating . 
  i believe they use mostly wood in generating the heat - all kinds of leftovers from the wood/forestry industries etc. 
  yes . 
  every independence day they will show the classic war movie `` unknown soldier '' on the tv , there is a televised military parade and war veterans are pretty central to the festivities . 
  there is also the defense force 's flag day in june , which also includes a military parade . 
  edit : i remember some finn on reddit saying that the finnish defense force is like that old mag-lite in your car trunk : somewhat dirty , bit old-fashioned and it smells kinda funny , but when the shit hits the fan , it works reliably and does it 's intended job . 
  also , monopoly and trivial pursuit have been popular , and i guess carcassonne as well . 
  the biggest brands are taffel and estrella . 
  taffel : the basic salted chips are possibly the most popular ones . 
  other popular ones are sourcream & onion , nacho cheese balls , ranch , grills , bbq , sourcream & sweet chili . 
  i guess the favourite estrella chip flavours tend to be the same as in the swedish post above . 
  i drink french press coffee . 
  i used to drink percolator coffee . 
  with sugar and milk/cream . 
  i only drink black coffee if i have to . 
  they look like potato chips , but they 're made out of rye . 
  the finns party . 
  i despise them . 
  the green league : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_league, 
  = the spring of pussies and the late winter of dicks !, 
  = go ski into a cunt !, 
  `` ash dick '' ( someone who ca n't get it up or ca n't produce any children ) turskapillu = cod pussy, 
  i have no idea . 
  i have n't really researched this stuff , but i believe i could trace them back at least until the 18th century with relative ease . 
  sifonet = dish cloth elovena = oatmeal ( porridge ) tampax = tampon googlettaa = a verb , to search something online, 
  common . 
  i remember doing exactly that , picking them up and putting them on a straw as a kid . 
  delicious and very sweet . 
  we call them `` mets\u00e4mansikka '' ( lit . 
  `` forest strawberry '' ) . 
  i would n't call `` kalsarik\u00e4nnit '' ( drinking alone in your home wearing just longjohns ) a `` lifestyle philosophy '' . 
  it is just a thing when you are too lazy to clean up and go to the bar . 
  good enough . 
  the selection could be larger , the same stuff keeps just appearing all the time . 
  lot of b-class and c-class movies and one-season wonders in the series . 
  that said , i have a decent backlog of stuff that i swear i will watch . 
  someday . 
  any of these days . 
  i love civilization and i have played civ 2 , freeciv and civ v extensively . 
  of course i play as finland if i can . 
  freeciv has finland natively , but in civ v i have to use mods . 
  i also frequently play as sweden , norway/viking , denmark and england . 
  rome is also one of my preferred ones . 
  edit : and i loathe alexander of greece/macedon in civ v . he is just a total dick most if the time . 
  i 'd say the more , the better . 
  yep , i do n't even remember the last time i saw 1c or 2c coins . 
  the smallest one we use is 5c . 
  helsinki has this reputation . 
  the rest of finland feels that ( some of ) the helsinkians ( ? ), 
  are uppity and smug and look at the `` rustics '' down their noses . 
  it does n't help that helsinki has a saying `` keh\u00e4 kolmosen ulkopuolella ei ole el\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4 '' ( `` there is no life outside the ring road no .
