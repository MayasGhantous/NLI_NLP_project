  `` mulatti '' was n't a derogatory term , say , in the 1950 's and before . 
  it has become a no-no since then , just like `` neekeri '' . 
  i consider the latter to be still a much worse thing to say . 
  maybe it 's just me , but the term `` sekarotuinen '' ( literally `` mixed race '' ) sounds much worse than `` mulatti '' if it is used about a person . 
  because usually one would use this when talking about dogs : `` minun koirani on sekarotuinen '' ( `` my dog is mixed-race/mixed-breed . 
  are the said tourists still mostly drunken finnish middle-aged dudes , or is there a greater variety these days ? 
  i actually did try to edit my post yesterday to include the `` negro '' option , but it did n't save the edit . 
  reddit was behaving a bit silly yesterday , because they were switching the servers or something like that . 
  any case , you are right . 
  this would be more accurate . 
  the exact same thing in finland with `` neekerinsuukko '' ( nigger kiss ) . 
  they were as well changed to just `` suukko '' ( kiss ) . 
  same wafer-cream-chocolate goodie . 
  and we had these images on liquorice and salted liquorice candies for a long time : https://www.halva.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14_supervahvasalmiakki.jpg, 
  also cmore . 
  there are spas and legitimate , licensed masseurs and then there are the sketchy thai places , although some of them actually are legit , genuine thai massage places . 
  but about 9 out of 10 are ... well , something else . 
  the atlantis allegory might have some basis in reality , namely the santorini volcano and things that happened after that . 
  northern crete and the minoan culture there was hit by a humongous tsunami triggered by the volcano exploding . 
  about two-thirds of that , so 2000 euros or so . 
  totalitarianism only makes the possible pre-existing problems infinitely more worse .

  history teacher germany it 's in his nature i could think of all sorts of not-so-flattering comebacks tp him just by using these ingredients . 
  that we were `` soviet '' during the cold war and our capital is called `` helsinski '' . 
  omg, 
  summer cabins !, 
  there is a crap ton of them , and many are actually livable during winters as well . 
  a second summer home , basically . 
  and it was a bloody one . 
  mass executions , prison camps , the works . 
  in finland when people discuss the 1910 's , it is always about the independence and the civil war and the stuff leading to it . 
  all that distant fighting in france ( world war ... one , i believe ? ), 
  is hardly even mentioned . 
  it is in florida that has swamps and space rockets , lots of beaches and fancy hotels , lots of cuban people . 
  `` miami vice '' and `` csi : miami '' . 
  that is what comes first to my mind . 
  oh , and of course that will smith song . 
  not that much , i guess . 
  i believe the default route are group homes at first and then foster families . 
  it used to be weirder , not so much any more . 
  definitely yes . 
  i believe the kids are much more into gaming , youtube and social media these days . 
  television programs and channels have segmented heavily , targeting more specific audiences , and every channel has it 's own web presence , the major ones offering their own online program libraries . 
  i shower every day , sometimes twice a day . 
  and saturday = sauna day . 
  speaking of snow , the climate change is really showing up here . 
  some decades ago southern finland got first snow in november or early december at latest , but these days december can be almost snowless , and you get decent snowfall only in january and february . 
  and it does n't even get that cold anymore in winter . 
  i fully expect to see a completely snow-free winter in southern finland during my lifetime . 
  i remember one mid-january morning , when i looked out the window and saw green grass and fog . 
  finnish-language rap is big and popular among the teens . 
  some of the artists fill up entire stadiums . 
  older generations are more into pop/rock , but some rap artists have become well-known household names . 
  hockey = serious business, 
  yeah . 
  pretty much every town house has an indoor sauna , many terraced houses have their own saunas inside each apartment ( or a common one for the entire house ) , apartment blocks usually have a common one . 
  plus there are all the summer cabins . 
  but saunas are literally everywhere - everybody has access to one , either you have one in your apartment , or the house you live in has a communal one . 
  no , but a federation of nations and/or areas would be nice . 
  it is mostly about disliking your foreign , economic and environmental policies and your politicians and super toxic political culture . 
  so the hatred is against your government and military-industrial complex , not really against ordinary americans . 
  that said , it is baffling how many americans seem to be willing to vote against their own interests ( * cough * trump * cough * ) and defend things like corporations freely jerking people around without any restraints , the death penalty , aggressive gun culture , gung-ho militarism , blind patriotism , not having access to affordable health care etc. 
  and being proud about defending such toxic and inhuman things . 
  especially on internet forums . 
  this does n't make any sense from a european point of view , so many just write off americans defending this stuff as dumb , ignorant and brainwashed by corporations . 
  finland prohibited corporal punishment of children in 1983 . 
  only folk dance groups use them while performing . 
  also some women during festivities may wear them , but it is unusual . 
  plus , death penalty does absolutely nothing to prevent crimes . 
  it only makes the criminals more ruthless - `` so i guess i will face the death penalty now , it does n't matter one bit if i kill even more people and cause even more destruction '' . 
  the finlandia hymn . 
  sometimes , but not that frequently . 
  maybe once a month or once every few weeks . 
  were you raised in a barrel ? 
  for someone who is naive/ignorant . 
  church bells for the church-goers , and the fire alarm/air raid system . 
  there are also nation-wide emergency system on the tv , that sometimes gives warnings if there is an industrial fire releasing toxic fumes , or if someone saw a bear in lapland . 
  in finland the 6th of december is kind of a big deal . 
  there is the televised presidential ball , with all the diplomats , the cabinet , the government , artists , entertainers , athletes and whatnot coming to the presidential palace , shaking hands with the prez , dancing and drinking . 
  there is a military parade in some city . 
  there are flags everywhere , candles are brought to all the graves of dead relatives . 
  `` the unknown soldier '' ( 1955 version ) will always be aired on this day . 
  finland , well-mannered ? 
  kind of surprising :-d, 
  also , `` ulkomaanpelle '' ( foreign clown ) is used generally about all foreign people . 
  `` ryss\u00e4 '' is the most common one used about russians , other not so common ones are `` vanja '' and `` iivana '' . 
  there is also `` slobo '' , which is used both of russians and slavic people in general . 
  why would we ? 
  no gas bill . 
  water is part of the rent , which is about 340 euros per month . 
  electricity is about 30 euros for three month consumption , so about 10 euros per month . 
  we only see those in chinese kung-fu movies , or on a vacation in thailand . 
  except for the letter b. finns do n't do these kind of fancy foreign letters like b , d , f , g , w. . . 
  swedes : happy , positive , stylish , overall nice and pleasant people ( this applies to other nordic countries - norway , denmark , iceland - as well ) . 
  many finn secretly wants to be like a swede , but they do n't admit it publicly . 
  germans : punctual , pragmatic , make high-quality products french : stylish , cultured , live in a beautiful country , great and interesting history , great food british : fun people , have a great sense of humour ( finns love british humour ) , great and interesting history italy : great food , great and interesting history , happy and relaxed folks , beautiful country, 
  latin was an optional language when i was in high school/gymnasium . 
  it really is a niche thing , at least hereabouts . 
  also , the sammallahdenm\u00e4ki bronze age burial ground ( and an unesco world heritage site ) . 
  there are a crap ton of stone age , bronze age and iron age sites in finland , but the vast majority of them are basically just piles of rock .
