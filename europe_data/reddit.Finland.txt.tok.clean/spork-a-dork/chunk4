  like , literally . 
  do n't eat where all the tourists eat . 
  eat where the locals eat ( usually some place not on the main avenue of a city ) . 
  some fake `` japanese '' names : hajosiko toyotasi = did your toyota broke ? 
  jokohama humahutan = do i hit already ? 
  mokomaki kamakasa = what a pile of crap ( usually fakely translated as a `` department store '' ) and all the swedes supposedly have names like pelle svensson , h\u00e5kan and \u00c5ke . 
  i guess anything with \u00e4 or \u00f6 in it , especially combined with the letter y : - \u00f6y - \u00d6yl\u00e4tti ( wafer ; as in the symbolic holy bread they give you in churches ) y\u00f6 ( night ) - \u00e4y - simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 probably also all the long double vocals and consonants : - aa - - oo - laakso kokoo koko kokko . 
  yep , we have this too , probably got it from the swedes . 
  h\u00e4nell\u00e4 ei ole kaikki muumit laaksossa = he does n't have all the moomins in the valley this means that someone is batshit crazy . 
  / / / suksi vittuun = go ski into a c * nt a way to tell someone to get lost , and fast . 
  / / / sataa kuin esterin perseest\u00e4 = it 's raining like from esther 's ass it is raining quite heavily . 
  sweden : everything has to be negotiated to the death , everybody 's opinion has to be heard , so that nobody gets offended or feel unequal to someone else . 
  as a result every project takes forever to complete . 
  also , somewhat effeminate but super-stylishy dressed menfolk . 
  great cars , nice furniture . 
  norway : a bearded guy in a knitted woolly sweater , standing on the shore of a fjord holding a fish . 
  estonia : little cousins from the south speaking funny finnish . 
  the netherlands : windmills , clogs , lots of tulips and porn shops . 
  germany : wear lederhosen , eat bratwurst , drink lotsa beer . 
  great cars , great roads , great f1 drivers . 
  france : fancy sexy folks that sit in a cafe in the shadow of the eiffel tower and sip absinthe from an exquisite glass , some croissants on the table and they are holding a poodle . 
  england : everybody speaks snobby upper-class english . 
  it is always cloudy , grey and it rains , unless there is fog . 
  bowler hats , umbrellas , two-decker red buses , little black cabs , big ben . 
  spain : tanned , hairy-chested dudes in bulging swimwear , wearing gold chains on their necks , walking on the torremolinos beach trying to hook up with all the blond tourist women . 
  italy , greece , turkey : see spain above . 
  there is spain , and not-spain , which is portugal . 
  menn\u00e4 perse edell\u00e4 puuhun = to climb a tree ass first to do things in an entirely wrong order . 
  yep , plural in finnish as well : `` alankomaat '' = literally `` netherlands/low countries '' . 
  when that volcano that nobody can pronounce blew up in iceland , i encountered some people on the internets who kept talking about `` the volcano in finland '' . 
  we do n't have any volcanoes , let alone any real mountains . 
  so i guess we just get mixed up with all those other nordic countries : http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/norsebynorsewest my pet peeve is when i try to search anything `` finnish '' related on the internet . 
  i always get results like `` how do i finnish this , how do i finnish that '' etc. 
  finnish = / = finish kind of annoying . 
  i have heard that the estonians do n't like when we say `` viro '' instead of `` eesti '' . 
  idk . 
  maybe the parola tank museum ? 
  every spring they have a family event where they crush a car with a stug , t-55 or a comet . 
  yeah , some live in sweden . 
  we have traditional street grill kiosks , basically little cabins on street corners that sell stuff like french fries , hamburgers , sausages , beverages etc. 
  very popular after a night at the bar . 
  these traditional corner grill kiosks were in dire straits for a long time , but recently they have become somewhat hip and fashionable once again . 
  example foods would be `` makkaraperunat '' , literally `` sausage potatoes '' ( french fries and fried slices of hot dog sausages ) and `` lihapiirakka '' , lit . 
  `` meat pie '' ( a dough pie filled with a mixture of minced meat and rice ) . 
  with ` all the condiments ' , of course . 
  `` avoliitto '' ( cohabitation ) is pretty common here i would say . 
  some like to get married and have that church wedding , some do n't . 
  no no no . 
  this is the greatest song from europe , ever .

  we were much more insular in the 1980 's , being kind of snuggled in the armpit of the soviet union . 
  there were very little foreigners and different ethnicities in the country . 
  it started changing really fast during the 1990 's , and the culture has become much more diverse compared to the 1980 's . 
  i lived my childhood in a small provincial municipality , and if someone told me back then that in about 15 years there would be kebab joints , various dark-skinned folks and people from the baltics and thailand living in my little town , i would n't have believed it . 
  for the longest time , the only black people ( or , generally , foreigners ) i saw were all on the tv screen . 
  of course there are those who would like to take the country back to the insularity of the pre-1990 's with their bs version of `` nationalism '' and `` patriotism '' . 
  so , more diversity + the whole internet/digitalization thing + non-smoking becoming the norm . 
  those are the first that come to my mind . 
  this works for finland as well . 
  i would n't change anything in that sentence . 
  as for my own nation , there would n't be too many hurdles to jump in this regard . 
  during the winter war we basically were in the same camp with the western allies , namely great britain and the us ( this is when germany and soviet union had the molotov-ribbentrop pact ) . 
  things flip-flopped really fast , so in 1941 we were technically the enemies of the western allies and in alliance with germany . 
  but there was no real animosity towards the western allies and non-existent military action against them . 
  so depending when the aliens attack , we already would be aligned with either gb/usa or with germany . 
  the biggest question would be relations with the soviet union and stalin . 
  they were the arch enemy during both of our wars ( winter war and continuation war ) , and the negotiations would be rather interesting in this scenario . 
  harry turtledove 's `` worldwar/colonization '' series . 
  n/a , thankfully . 
  colonizing other nations is more trouble than worth , really . 
  no idea . 
  i 've just heard this comparison . 
  your guess is as good as mine . 
  i 've heard that helsinki is the dallas of europe . 
  or possibly just dallas of finland ? 
  i ca n't remember . 
  and i have really no idea what it is supposed to mean . 
  tampere , finland can be compared to manchester , great britain ( industrial city etc. ) . 
  tampere even has a nickname `` mansesteri '' . 
  region-wise , i 've heard that ostrobothnia is like the wild west/texas of finland , and savonia is like the mexico of finland . 
  i guess this refers to the apparent overall similar mentality of the people living in those areas . 
  easy !, 
  or any other random swedish city/town/municipality , to be honest . 
  i 'm just imagining a stained-glass window picturing him flying v-style , with a halo around his helmet . 
  i do . 
  the last three or four books i 've read have been about history . 
  now i 'm reading a book about the prehistory of finland . 
  i also have one unfinished book about history/anthropology/genetics ( karin bojs : `` homo europaeus '' ) . 
  before that i read a couple of general european history books . 
  i still have the `` oxford history of britain '' sitting on my shelf , waiting it 's turn . 
  i bought it a couple of years ago , but have n't managed to read it yet . 
  i imagine the length of `` poronkusema '' depends on the size of the bladder of the individual animal . 
  omg this . 
  i used to use the regular ones , but they gave me painful aphthous ulcers in my mouth . 
  i migrated to non-foaming tooth pastes and settled for zendium . 
  it is a god-sent , really . 
  kind of lame . 
  it used to be just sketch shows on tv for so long , with the occasional cheaply-made comedy movie thrown in the mix , with jokes , stereotypical characters and one-liners repeated to death and beyond . 
  luckily stand-up has really taken off in the last 5-10 years or so with decent native stand-up comedians . 
  it is super popular these days .
