  depends on the person in question . 
  that is strange . 
  so they had a sort of ` internationale ' then . 
  i guess it did n't work so well . 
  1980 's and 1990 's , especially the latter decade . 
  you ca n't reason people out of the ideological positions they did n't reason themselves into . 
  and these ideological positions encompass religions , political beliefs and moral beliefs . 
  they usually stem more from irrational beliefs , prejudices and preconceptions than from actual rational thought processes . 
  the only one who really can change a person 's mind and worldview is ultimately that person him/herself , and it can take a lot of both conscious and unconscious personal thought work ( exposure to different people with different views , lifestyles , cultures , subcultures etc. 
  in the 1990 's finland had a `` natural law party '' ( luonnonlain puolue ) , which wanted to `` raise the spiritual welfare of the individual and society '' . 
  in order to do this they wanted to employ 7000 `` yoga flyers '' . 
  they showed them on the tv news - they sat with their legs crossed and did small hops in the air . 
  they have since been removed from the party register . 
  i know many people seem to hate fury , but for me it is maybe one of the most gritty and realistic world war 2 movies . 
  grim and brutal , but a great movie . 
  plus the fact that they used actual ww2 tanks in it . 
  the tiger was the only existing functional one in europe , if i remember correctly . 
  also the fury sherman was the real deal . 
  yep , monument men was really good . 
  i spent some time googling and wikipedia-ing the background story after watching it , which is always a sign of a good historical movie - it gets you interested in the real story behind the film . 
  yes . 
  you can download library e-books to your device , and after a certain time ( i think it was two weeks ) they will delete themselves . 
  probably because most teens find it to be extremely boring , so they just learn it for the exams , be done with it , and forget most of it . 
  yeah , this dude : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksis_kivi https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/seitsem\u00e4n_veljest\u00e4 these are not compulsory i think , but everybody and their mother knows them and many can quote their works from memory , especially the `` unknown soldier '' : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00e4in\u00f6_linna https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_unknown_soldier_ ( novel ) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/under_the_north_star_trilogy mika waltari is my personal favourite , although i have n't read his books in years : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mika_waltari https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_egyptian maybe also some poems by eino leino : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eino_leino and of course there is kalevala , as others have already said . 
  one learns the overall story in school , but you only are able to quote a few snippets from memory . 
  i remember `` generation kill '' to be pretty good . 
  too bad it got cancelled . 
  yeah , swedish is taught in schools all over finland since it is the second official language , but it is really used as an everyday language only by a minority of people on the sea shores . 
  just move inland about 40 km , and nobody speaks any swedish anymore . 
  i myself can roughly understand the general idea of a swedish-language news article , but do n't ask me to form a complete sentence and speak it . 
  so kind of a reversal of the stendahl syndrome ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stendhal_syndrome there is also jerusalem syndrome : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerusalem_syndrome, 
  `` band of brothers '' was ( and is ) a great series , i enjoyed it very much . 
  the best ww2 series in existence , perhaps . 
  i also read the book it was based on . 
  `` pacific '' was also pretty good , but i like `` bob '' much more . 
  `` inglorious basterds '' was a disappointment . 
  it felt like tarantino chose the wrong scenes to be included in the movie - like he included all those filler scenes that usually are cut out of a movie , and instead cut out the scenes that actually move the plot forward . 
  and if you watch one movie about d-day , watch `` the longest day '' instead of `` saving private ryan '' . 
  it is so much better . 
  finland is happier than sweden ?!, 
  say whaaat ? 
  our former president , martti ahtisaari , once showed up on a television interview with a band-aid on his forehead . 
  when the interviewer asked him about it , martti said `` this is what happens when you have a mandolin hangover '' . 
  `` mandolin hangover '' became a popular term after that . 
  oh , that thing :-) yeah , i just gave some examples that came first to my mind . 
  finland has a surprising amount of military marches for a country of some 5,4 million people or so . 
  i did n't include any traditional folk songs , although they too have some patriotic lyrics . 
  and most popular modern ` patriotic ' songs are schlagers listened by the post-war generation ( suuret ik\u00e4luokat ) . 
  i ca n't tell if younger generations really have any widely popular ` patriotic ' songs that everybody knows . 
  i kind of like that one . 
  it 's very ` golden mean ' . 
  ( cut them down , son of north ! ), 
  many of them are military marches , for obvious reasons . 
  jaeger march by sibelius : https://youtu.be/d7b8e2lgly4 muistoja pohjolasta ( memories of the [ or from the ] north ) : https://youtu.be/ce3qmtghriw porilaisten marssi ( march of the bj\u00f6rneborgers ) : https://youtu.be/bw4xuop8ez4 some more modern and more sing-songy pieces that are well known and popular : sininen ja valkoinen ( blue and white ) by jukka kuoppam\u00e4ki : https://youtu.be/rr7lopc3bjk katson sineen taivaan ( i 'm looking at the blue sky ) by katri helena . 
  it is not ` patriotic ' per se , but nevertheless super-finnish . 
  my understanding is that the mediterranean coast - spain , italy , greece etc. 
  - will face increasing droughts and forest fires , possibly even desertification . 
  all over europe , droughts , forest fires , storms and deathly heat waves will increase ( extreme weather phenomena will be more commonplace ) . 
  scandinavia / nordic countries will have the samekind of vegetation and temperatures as northern germany has now . 
  snowy winters will become a memory and winters will be rainy . 
  the real joker card is the gulf stream . 
  if it stops pushing warm water from the caribbean to europe , there might be a new mini ice age - paradoxically europe could become much colder . 
  their language is finno-ugric , but i believe they have genetically more in common with the basques . 
  the ancestors of the sami people apparently came to the north by following the ice-free coast of norway , and originally they are from the ice-age refugium in the iberian peninsula . 
  finland here . 
  the more industrial and more urban union vs. the more traditional and rural confederacy with plantation economy utilising slave labour . 
  my personal view is that the war had more to do with the different economic and political systems in north and south and who gains from them , more than about `` freeing the slaves '' . 
  i have a feeling that this was really a secondary goal for the union . 
  otherwise , it was a pretty standard , classical civil war : extremely bloody , dirty and brutal . 
  finland : one of our former presidents died and was buried a few weeks ago . 
  there were a televised state funeral and flags were half-mast everywhere , but i do n't believe there was a national day of mourning . 
  generally , flags at half-mast and moments of silence are the most common things to happen in a big tragedy . 
  when the `` estonia '' sunk , flags were also at half-mast everywhere . 
  finland gains about a square kilometer of new land from the sea every year , because the bedrock is still rising about 8 mm per year after the last ice age . 
  many coastal cities have relocated themselves during our history because the harbours tend to dry up . 
  finland ... 
  i think mostly men whose jobs include finance , business , technology etc. 
  the usual suspects . 
  the whole leasing scheme is a thing here too . 
  certain people seem to go to ridiculous lengths in order to appear to be wealthy . 
  also guys past their fifties . 
  paraphrasing my sister : `` the only thing they still have standing stiff is their sanity '' . 
  `` vikings '' . 
  they remember ragnar lothbrok 's village to be in `` kattegat '' and expect norway with mountains and fjords . 
  finland does not have their own royalty , but we kind of loan the swedish one . 
  although many finns do n't like to admit it publicly , we really do like the swedish royal family and treat them as our own . 
  for a finn , swedish does sound sing-songy , bouncy and more high-pitched than finnish . 
  french really does sound smooth , suave , sophisticated and yes , kind of sexy too . 
  the finns sound happy ? 
  huh . 
  that is so weird , usually the finns are seen as somewhat gloomy and depressed . 
  i 've heard multiple times that finnish sounds like japanese ( although japanese does n't sound much like finnish to me ) . 
  so we sound like happy japanese people . 
  finland : some time ago it was revealed that in the early 1990 's the government apparently had a contingency plan for placing tens of thousands of troops on the eastern border should the breaking of the soviet union lead to massive amounts of refugees . 
  i 'm not sure if this is true or did the yellow press just pull it out of their asses , really . 
  finland : ice hockey , rally driving , formula 1 , pes\u00e4pallo ( finnish baseball ) , track & field ( especially javelin ) , skiing , ski jumping . 
  finland : i actually saw a kid with a fidget spinner on the bus a couple of days ago . 
  i guess it 's only now catching on hereabouts . 
  but pokemon go ... that shit was everywhere last summer .
