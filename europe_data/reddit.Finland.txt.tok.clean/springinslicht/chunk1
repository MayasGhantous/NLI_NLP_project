i remember that , was the poor guy never really found ? 
  okay , thanks for clarifying . 
  thanks !, 
  i did n't even think about it lol . 
  so does this imply it comes from somewhere else ? 
  what am i looking at ? 
  not sure if should upvote or downvote . 
  i agree . 
  and i never agree with swedes . 
  that should tell something . 
  its of course everyones personal taste , but i 've always found mcdonalds offerings superior compared to hesburger . 
  its only good if you take the chicken burger or whatever it called , avoid everything else . 
  i would not recommend going to malminkartano . 
  yeah the view would be good , if there was something to look at apart from forest and boring apartment blocks . 
  umm what ? 
  cathay pacific is one of the most highly rated airlines in every aspect . 
  it 's part of oneworld alliance which also is rated the best out of the three . 
  i 've personally flown cathay pacific on 4 different flights in economy class and have really nothing bad to say . 
  superb airline and superb facilities at hong kong airport . 
  just because it 's an old soviet made plane does n't mean it 's somehow automatically unsafe . 
  those old soviet birds are actually one of the most robust passenger planes there are , what causes the most problems is poor maintenance and poor airmanship somewhat related to the culture . 
  the il-62 's safety record is n't any worse or better compared to some of the western planes from the same era . 
  excluding some african and indonesian carriers , which ones ? 
  i do n't know about soviet times . 
  yeah i think he 's exaggerating , the rattling sound you described was likely coming from something else than the actual bolts and fasteners that hold the seats to the floor . 
  at the moment they operate over 100 airbuses , 15 boeings and 15 new sukhois . 
  never . 
  if it was true aeroflot would not be flying . 
  replace emirates with singapore or cathay pacific and you 're good to go . 
  ehh ... no they are n't . 
  the thing that is not working for them is the short-haul sector , but the long-haul routes are highly profitable . 
  and to have a working transit hub they need the short-haul flights to feed their long-haul routes . 
  that 's why they are outsourcing the short-haul operations to flybe nordic which they set up with british low-cost carrier flybe , because it will be cheaper . 
  if you 're a 10 year old girl , that is . 
   13 people from finland who are now going to the european parliament to do what ? 
  ah , yes !, 
  needs more , and * bigger * ^ ^ ^ pictures . 
  for those wondering , uusimaa refers to a region . 
  i love tallinn 's old town . 
  * 49 % of jokerit . 
   and crappy pop music . 
  what did you say ? 
  and the nips . 
  something like +90 % of the soviet bombers just turned away from helsinki because they did n't want to or just could n't fly through the heavy aa barrage . 
  ( or whats it called ? ), 
  from the almost 2000 bombers in three different bombing raids only about 100 planes got through of which 20 were shot down . 
  explains why the city did n't suffer that much even though they were pretty big operations from the ussr . 
  no idea why they chose to show that picture lol . 
  he 's not . 
  also a couple of the protestors got run over by police horses when they threw some signs ( very stupid thing to do ) at them and the horses bolted away . 
  and after that they complained how the police could n't handle their horses ... 
  snow niggers ? 
  well thats new . 
  `` sweden failed totally in the pisa tests - today was a good day '' - whole finland . 
  haha , you 're worse than russia and the us !, 
  suck it sweden , we won . 
  to annoy swedes . 
  do n't complain , you were on the front page of reddit today . 
  it 's a great show !, 
  they started showing the series from the start last year here , been watching it quite a bit . 
  it 's `` yksi , kaksi , kolme '' , you can listen to the pronunciation here : http://translate.google.fi/#fi/en/yksi%20kaksi%20kolme, 
  nobody cares about the skoda cup . 
  hmm . 
  then uhh , take a private plane to the alps , rent a huge cottage from the mountain top , and use a helicopter as a skilift . 
  terrible news . 
  i literally burst into laughter after that last image . 
  * `` feel the inspiration !, 
  '' * i do n't feel the inspiration , but i feel bad for salzburg . 
   i think that some of the questions were a bit ambiguous and also the : not as a neighbour : homosexuals yes/no what should i answer if i 'm positive about homosexual being my neighbours ? 
  result : sweden ... 
  ah , russian dashcams , they never miss a thing . 
  whether its an asteroid , a terrorist attack , or just a random guy getting run over by a car , the dashcams got it . 
  first world problems - i had to walk 20 minutes to a doctors appointment . 
  but she showed them her boobs !, 
  how could they let such an offense go without any repercussions ?!? 
  and who is this `` shell '' ? 
  because its european , how hard is it to understand, 
  it 's just that most of europe is pretty unifrom in this otherwise . 
  much wow indeed . 
  did i imply that it is ? 
  meanwhile in finland : kaksi, 
  so uhh , where is the greek military ? 
  why was this deleted ? 
   better start learning finnish now . 
  good luck with that . 
  or throwing a bed from the 10th floor balcony to the swimming pool while piss drunk at 4am . 
  what 's going on with that blue house on the top left ? 
  it 's ... weird ... 
   he is either a complete moron paging / u/here _ comes_the_king, 
  i 've been watching planes land pretty much weekly for the past twenty years at my local airport , i know what a plane landing looks like . 
  a lot of aviation enthusiasts are saying its sped up on other forums too . 
  the plane seems to be coming a bit too fast for landing and the movements look too quick and unnatural for plane that big even if its very windy . 
  if i had to guess i 'd day its maybe running at like 1.2 x the speed , for a more dramatic effect and of course , more views . 
  the video seems to be slightly sped up, 
  i think he 's being sarcastic . 
  here 's some more when they 're speaking english : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvkxszdfenc, 
  this is ridiculous . 
  they still use swastikas in some of their flags : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/suomen_ilmavoimien_esikunta.svg/581px-suomen_ilmavoimien_esikunta.svg.png and the finnish presidential flag also has a swastika , although kind of hidden : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/presidential_standard_of_finland.svg/1901px-presidential_standard_of_finland.svg.png edit : aand too slow, 
  f-22 is n't available . 
  not to be confused with the newer , and improved f/a -18 e [ 3 ] , which in turn is made by boeing .
