  from [ finnish wikipedia ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduskuntatalo ) :  the architect j.s. 
  sir\u00e9n adopted the ancient greco-roman architectural idiom to give the building a sense of monumentality , symbolising a strong state , democracy and national unity . 
  these romans are crazy !, 
   not to mention all of the unpaid days my parents had to take off work to run me between doctors and hospitals that 's an interesting point of difference between the us and europe i had n't thought of before . 
  in finland , where i 'm from , depending on your profession and the collective bargaining agreement in your field , you can take up to four consecutive paid days off to take care of your child - three for your own health-related absence . 
  sure , it can be abused , but is n't too much . 
  furthermore , [ the sole mep ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/merja_kyll%c3%b6nen ) ( wiki in finnish ) that was elected for the left alliance is pretty far from a `` far-left '' politician , whatever that may be in finland 's case .

  finland at least does n't use 1 or 2 cent coins , but has non-rounded prices ( also as a consequence of weighed vegetables ) . 
  if the total is , say , $ 8.01 , the cashier automatically rounds it to the nearest 5 cents , so if you 're paying in cash , you pay $ 8 . 
  if you 're paying with a debit or credit card , you 're paying exactly $ 8.01 .

  three things , aware that this is not a map you made : 1 ) assuming that the etymology of helsinki is indeed related to birds of some kind and not to `` the neck '' of the similarly named river , one proposed etymology for helsinki is swedish `` h\u00e4lsing '' . 
  [ according to the swedish nationalencyklopedin ] ( http://www.ne.se/h%c3%a4lsing ) , a * h\u00e4lsing * is `` ung ejderhane med en fj\u00e4derdr\u00e4kt som starkt avviker fr\u00e5n den vuxna hanens praktdr\u00e4kt '' , or `` young common eider with a plumage that differs strongly from that of an adult eider '' . 
  common eider ( * somateria mollissima * ) and barnacle goose ( * branta leucopsis * ) are only very distantly related , and the latter has come to live around helsinki in great numbers only in the last century or so . 
  2 ) no translations for kunlun ( elder brother 's arrangement ) and tibet ( the heights ) ? 
  3 ) the surname of the qin dynasty , which gave its name to china , may originally mean a variety of rice , but if the mapmakers chose to translate this , why not the city of warsz or franz josef land ? 
  it would have been equally pointless in all these cases , in my opinion , to dig further than to a personal name . 
  history of sweden ends at 1660 ? 
  then there was [ the announcement of structural reforms ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/structural_reforms_announced_aged_care_slashed_by_300_million_euros/6961979 ) which among other things slashes government-paid services for the elderly and children .

  it may not be perfect ( vote for a progressive in a party but end up helping to elect the same party 's conservative figurehead ?

  it 's sad to have to agree with that sentiment . 
  i despise maggie 's policies , but she had more balls than all pm 's after her combined . 
  interesting - the same proverb is in finnish as well , only the other way around ( `` sanasta miest\u00e4 , sarvesta h\u00e4rk\u00e4\u00e4 '' ) . 
  it might not be as bad as it seems , if what remains of nokia plays their cards right - taking it easy for a while , focus on networks ( which has been a healthy subsidiary all along ) and innovating in some brand new sectors , eventually acquire jolla and get back in business .

  do you mean as in `` femtonhundratalet '' ? 
  technically , it 's not the same as 15th century , but it makes it easier to get confused when speaking about centuries in english ( finnish does it similarly ) .

  except that the general vibe in finland is hardly second most european . 
  in many of those countries ( such as finland ) , minimum salary is not mandated by law but by trade union bargaining . 
  therefore , the minimum salary varies by field . 
  finland adopted the credit card licence in 1997 and had an a7-size plastic card from 1990 , but apparently there 're still some pre-90 paper licences in circulation - my friend said the police told him to get a new one to replace his original from 1988 ...
