  [ turku archipelago trail in the summer ] ( http://www.turkutouring.fi/en/archipelago-trail_en ) 5 . 
  any major city ( helsinki , turku , tampere ) in may when people finally come back to life after a long , dark winter . 
  [ glorious m\u00e4mmi !, 
  too damn high . 
  but not to worry , the new government is going to cut that , along with everything except defense and agriculture . 
  ** finland ** * [ austerity on the way with sipil\u00e4 government plan ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/austerity_on_the_way_with_sipila_government_plan/8020870 ) . 
  government is formed by centre party , right-wing conservative national coalition party and populist finns party . 
  prime minister sipil\u00e4 ( centre ) has a `` successful business career '' and `` sipil\u00e4 often refers to himself as an ` engineer ' who seeks simple solutions and cuts through endless political wrangling '' * that has pretty much taken up all the news time since wednesday . 
  except that they still need to get stubb and soini to agree on stuff . 
  it 's not like the government has been formed yet . 
  i 'm going to break our secret tryst and the trust of all my fellow finns ( vittu arvatkaa paljonko kiinnostaa ) , and say that was mr. eikka kosonen , ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary , permanent representative of the republic of finland to the european union . 
  but i wonder what was going on at the time , because the advance foreign ministry press release said both tuomioja and lehtom\u00e4ki would be there .

  if you do n't mind that the lyrics are not in english , might i suggest giving [ stam1na ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivumrlnhxma ) a shot ? 
  my favourite part of the video after all these years is still how he says `` hyv\u00e4\u00e4 '' ( `` that was good '' ) at the end . 
  in this case , mostly socially liberal ( do what thou wilt type stuff ) , economically conservative ( cut all government spending expect when it helps businesses ) . 
  [ so much of this hurts my brain ] ( https://fi.wikiquote.org/wiki/leena_hietanen ) ... 
  i 'm 39 and i 've not voted only once when i was * really * hungover and could n't get out of bed . 
  : - * but that was for the european parliament ... 
  like others have pointed out , there are several problems with the maps . 
  i wonder where you gathered this information from , because it looks like very little actual fact checking has gone into it . 
  this is from a finnish perspective . 
  you should make a decision what to do with umlauts and stick with it , if you really want to be `` current , credible , consistent '' . 
  some places like most of the maps have working umlauts ( though siilinjarvi should be siilinj\u00e4rvi and on some maps aland sb \u00c5land ) , but in other places you 've skipped them altogether ( salpausselka sb salpausselk\u00e4 , salamajarvi sb salamaj\u00e4rvi , niinisto sb niinist\u00f6 , sipila sb sipil\u00e4 ) . 
  others have weird encoding problems ( regions maps : etel\u00f5-karjala sb etel\u00e4-karjala , similar for etel\u00f5-savo and kanta-h\u00f5me . 
  plus dashes between region names in finnish sometimes are there , sometimes they are n't . 
  would be a good idea to do a bit of copy editing on the texts , e.g. 
  `` finland joined the united nations in 1955 and a member of the european union in 1995 . '', 
  and `` two other important airports are tampere , lappeenranta , and turku '' . 
  it 's like you have n't even looked at what you 've been doing : finland political map has two provinces of central finland ( and * reservir ) . 
  you have a map of turku ( which is mostly almost correct , sometimes a bit funny like when what 's named as the city library is a small suburban library ) , but it 's not linked on the main page 's list . 
  on the main map , hanko is displaced onto kemi\u00f6 island , i guess out of the way of the text for nuuksio national park . 
  but then it 's misplaced again on the road map . 
  inari is nowhere near where it 's marked on the map ; there 's nothing at that spot . 
  the town of inari is actually next to lake inari , surprisingly enough , just south of the village of kaamanen ( which should n't be there ) . 
  road map : i wonder where you got this , because it 's wildly inconsistent about what counts as a major road . 
  for example , the road north of turku is about the same capacity as one that 's missing altogether : directly from turku to the last little bend on the helsinki-tampere road ( at valkeakoski , south of tampere ) . 
  oh , and it 's not at eura that several roads meet , it 's huittinen - same on a lot of maps . 
  `` finalnd '' stock exchanges map ... oh dear , where to start . 
  maybe start by being consistent with your other maps . 
  you tried , i guess ? 
  yeah , and if it 's [ the map i 'm thinking of ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9653497/british-have-invaded-nine-out-of-ten-countries-so-look-out-luxembourg.html ) , a country was painted red if there was even a small occupation of a small part of the present-day territory . 
  for example , english troops [ occupied and subsequently destroyed a fort in \u00c5land during the crimean war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bomarsund ) , and supposedly that counts as an `` invasion of finland '' .

  plus , his sidekick is called saunabad . 
  iznogoud and mortadelo y filem\u00f3n for me . 
  ( edit : finnish ahmed ahne ; \u00c4lli ja t\u00e4lli = ahmed the greedy , wit and hit , as in hit on the head ), 
  asked for the origin , but nevermind , [ current research says it 's unclear ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_germany#names_from_baltic_regions ) . 
  that was really nice , even though i did n't understand anything . 
  most of the country names were understandable , but where does vokietija for germany come from ? 
  it all started with [ the netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eld2awfn9nc ) making a mock welcome video for trump , and now everyone and their dog is doing these . 
  [ or any snow ] ( http://www.iflscience.com/environment/snow-sponge-toxic-car-exhaust-particles/ ) , apparently . 
  the island you 're thinking of is lauttasaari , ferry island . 
  but yeah , that 's the west metro . 
  [ if they ever finish it ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/lansimetro_ceo_replaced_metro_extension_price_tag_still_rising/9292228 ) ... 
  i feel like that song could easily be made into a new iteration of [ hatten \u00e4r din ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgdfcktrqw8 ) . 
  you can see an alternative timeline in viipuri/vyborg . 
  it was one of finland 's major cities , until finland lost it to the soviet union in the second world war . 
  the soviet union had little interest in either developing or demolishing vyborg so it pretty much [ remained in its pre-war state ] ( http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/6/67/vyborg_banner.jpg/1800px-vyborg_banner.jpg ) , while finnish cities became ... [ that ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/rumattalot_etu_kouvolavirasto_1911ms_uu.jpg ) . 
  one can only imagine what the view would be if vyborg had remained in finnish hands . 
  probably source was artist 's imagination ; there are mountains in finland in the flattest part of the country . 
  [ i imagine it sounded something like this ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/makhorka ) . 
  the last time the swedish people 's party was not in government was in 1978-1979 when they resigned from the sorsa government . 
  do n't know why , though . 
  i guess they 're talking about [ bomarsund ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bomarsund,_%c3%85land ) and other battles during the crimean war . 
  there at least they were able to land on what is now finnish soil . 
  some comments have referred to petsamo , but that 's not current finnish territory . 
  anyway , the term `` invasion '' is a bit far-fetched when all they did in many cases was like bomarsund , just a small skirmish . 
  '' [ people of european descent on average have a high alcohol tolerance and are less likely to develop alcoholism compared to aboriginal australians , native americans and some east asian groups .

  why thank you !, 
  i chose the irish , though ... 
  but why should it say that if there is a significant portion of subscribers who are not europhiles but simply interested in the goings-on of this part of the world and possibly highly critical of the eu ? 
  europhile is a loaded word that mainly identifies those people as being for further european integration . 
  i was going to ask when the uk became a part of northern europe , but [ apparently the un considers the uk to be included there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe ) . 
  what i meant is the nordic countries . 
  counting the uk alongside the nordic countries in anything but purely geographic terms is , in my opinion , disingenuous , because the cultural and political differences are far greater than , say , between denmark and finland and even denmark and germany . 
  or northern europe ? 
  too often these polls that try to show something about europe are only about the uk , france and germany , maybe about spain and italy . 
  i thought it was interesting how the greatest number to think their culture is not superior to others was france . 
  but the idea even then was that when economies become integrated , peace will follow .
