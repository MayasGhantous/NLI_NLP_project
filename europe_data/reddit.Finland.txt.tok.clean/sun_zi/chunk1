discussion about the letter and ela : http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2014/11/06/letters-of-november-2010/, 
  diverged about 60 years ago ? 
  what happened in 1954 ? 
  what ever you smoke -- consider cutting it . 
  younger stubb was kinda prick , but reportedly he changed during his year as exchange student in florida . 
  the living standard was slowly increasing until the 1970s but then the inefficient economy of the geopolitical catastrophe started to falter . 
  the rapidly rising oil prices helped to prolong the inevitable until the late 1980s . 
  when oil money dried up the reforms by gorbatschev had no chance . 
  had the reforms started earlier or if the oil prices had been more stable , the prison of the peoples would have had a chance to stumble forward a few years . 
   russians would have a living standard on par with america oh yes . 
  living standard of america of 1930s , already in 2030s . 
  the russians who overthrew czar were themselves displaced by kaiser-backed thugs in november . 
  while those thugs managed to get the first man in the space , poverty was a different thing . 
  the living standard gained the pre-war levels in 1960s . 
  putin poses in such homoerotic way in his photos that i 've always wondered why they are not censored in russia . 
  but perhaps every country must have their own tom . 
  tom of russia just happens to be president . 
  those android phones were on sale a few months before acquisition was cleared . 
  the problem was that nokia knew they were running out money already in 2009 and had to find a partner with deep pockets . 
  they had to renew not only their software but also the hardware . 
  the ti omap line nokia was using in their flagship models simply did not have enough oomph . 
  so first they found intel ( and founded meego ) , but intel was never able to deliver . 
  then nokia tried to court google , failed to do so , but got a very good deal with microsoft . 
  putin 's pockets are not deep enough for that . 
  simultaneous rain and snow is * r\u00e4nt\u00e4 * in finnish . 
  the problem is you can not inflect harriet in icelandic . 
  you can not name your kid as ( \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) in any country , i bet . 
  zero impact . 
  the pork imports to russia have been cut off since last december . 
  just because . 
   why did the red army use a lot of barrier troops ? 
  why did they make that decision ? 
  because they needed to win the war . 
  if they did not , the russian people would have perished under the genocidal nazi regime . 
  please remember the genocidal nazi regime was their ally . 
  if they had not won the war , stalin would have looked rather silly in the eyes of nazis ( but of course he did , even though he eventually did won the war ) . 
  oh you did not speak about winter war ? 
  the rather pointless slaughter of their own troops was nothing new for soviets in 1941 or 1945 , either . 
  was the prestige of red army , the vanity of the future generalissimus or the future of the russian people itself on stake , the soviets got their own troops killed in vain . 
  or if someone said something you do n't like on facebook , you could remove their stuff from facebook . 
  this is about removing other people 's work from google search results . 
  not yours . 
  there was a popular initiative for [ it ] getting rid of male-only conscription , but it did not get enough signatures . 
  how is the election going on then ? 
  you just bang your sword on your shield ? 
  iceland but not denmark in beer europe ? 
  what about the expedition in norway ? 
  does that count ? 
  there are no simple rules to add a masculine or feminine suffix and do with it ? 
  in finnish there is opposite tendency , the first names are declined as if they are not part of the language , e.g. , lumi ( `` snow '' ) is declined as lumi-lumin -- lumia ( +14 other forms ) as first name and as lumi -- lumen -- lunta as generic noun . 
   a country ca n't just lead people on for years with promises of x , y and z , and then suddenly take away the candy at the last minute , it 's just going to cause discontent . 
  they are harmonizing the rules with eu . 
  the tightening part is mostly bullshitting , they are just repeating the current requirements in the press release . 
  the harmonization with eu rules does not change anything , really , so why bother to hurry with it ? 
  the press release is there just to fool the prospective migrants and voters of soini 's party . 
  of course there is [ requirement for stable and sufficient income ] ( http://www.migri.fi/moving_to_finland_to_be_with_a_family_member/income_requirement ) . 
  it meant that hardworking but low-wage people could not bring their families here . 
  the required 2600 $ / month for spouse and two kids translates to gross wage of 3800 $ / month . 
  now you look at the migri page again and check `` who does not need a secure income ? 
  '' , then check the press release . 
  what the press release does ** not ** say ? 
  this sounds exactly like the current family reunification rules . 
  because they do not say what changes i 'd guess it just bluffing and anti-marketing to the prospective asylum seekers . 
  edit : they ** are ** the current family reunification rules :   under the aliens act in force , a residence permit may be issued on the basis of family ties to applicants who, 
   the government goal was not stimulate the whole economy to grow the outspoken goal was to stimulate whole economy ; obviously you have access to some , more secret information . 
  it would be nice if you could share that . 
   as government is n't adding new money to the economy i must confess that this requirement of new money confuses me a lot . 
  government help cities to loan money and spend it on social housing construction projects . 
  however , it does not count because it is not new money ? 
  what is new money ? 
  the normal keynesian model assumes that private sector saves during a recession ; the idea of keynesian stimulus is that public sector loans the money saved by private sector and spends it . 
  this makes sure that the existing production capacity does not sit idle and decay . 
  an extra bonus is earned if the public sector can spend the money in something useful . 
  can we agree that money spent building new social housing is extra money , money that would have not been spent ( until much later ) if it was not part of a stimulation package ? 
   i 'm criticizing the government who thinks the cost of labor is the problem government clearly thinks that cost of labor is a problem , not the problem . 
  why do you think otherwise ? 
   tries to achieve internal devaluation by lowering the wages . 
  the solution a would have not touched the wages . 
  government proposed to lower the extra wages only after unions refused to increase the yearly working time . 
   as overall the labor costs in finland are lower than in germany or in sweden , that might be true , however , it does not help in cases where the labor cost is higher . 
  also , it does not help in cases where the total costs have risen above the competition because the increase in labor costs . 
   can you name any significant stimulus investment target the government has done during the past 7 years to combat recession ? 
  that is easy . 
  when the building industry collapsed in 2008 the building of ara social housing was hikes in 2009 -- 2012 by doubling the incentives for building companies . 
  normally 3.000 -- 4.000 ara apartments were built yearly , in 2009 14.000 ara apartments were started and 12.000 in 2010 . 
  you were born this morning , right ? 
   [ wages have continued climbing ] at a lower rate than before wages have risen 20 % while gdp has contracted . 
   decreasing labor costs is not going to create new products to export . 
  you seem to think that we can only have one problem in the economy at the time . 
  yes , nokia and most of the electronics industry has disappeared after 2011 , but it does not mean that low-tech and low productivity jobs are not disappearing at an alarming rate . 
  mechanical wood industry is also in trouble . 
  when the labor costs for a 24/7 mill are lower in both sweden and germany the new investments are not made in finland . 
  if you happen to be an expert in international law . 
  or if you are an expert making business contracts . 
  perhaps then you can have chances . 
  we have done stimulus last 7 years with no noticeable effect . 
  as a result our public sector is now largest in eu ( when compared to gdp ) and the public sector debt has grown more than in 1990s recession . 
  we spend more than 1.2 % of gdp to serve the debt . 
  during the recession the wages have continued climbing . 
  the climb has been driven by the public sector jobs .
