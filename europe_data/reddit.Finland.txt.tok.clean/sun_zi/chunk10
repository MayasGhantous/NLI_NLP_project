  yes , some of them even called themselves pubs , but it might be that they are not members of bbpa . 
  it looks like not all the scottish pubs are marked on the map . 
  this is almost as informative as [ the wine-growing regions of finland ] ( http://www.kansallismuseo.fi/fi/image/4844/zz-suomikartta.gif ) . 
  do greeks have some kind of modernized new testament or do they use the antique or byzantine versions ? 
  wikipedia says till 1955 , but at least in finland people used the `` viinakortti '' or spirit licenseh for identification purposes long afterwards . 
  `` full load '' was one liter of spirits ( and two bottles of strong wine ) , weekly allowance from alko . 
  the rationing started in 1944 and it was in force until 1970 . 
  excellent way to introduce everyone to alcoholism . 
  if you do not buy your full allowance , you are plain stupid . 
  i believe sweden had similar system , * motbok * , but they had more common sense and stopped it already in 1955 . 
  problem is scarcity . 
  you can not eat the cake and save it , too . 
  of course , both are lying . 
  the logical conclusion is that the economic policy of left is not `` left '' , but all a cynical lie . 
  for some reason the balaclava is the [ most controversial piece ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000005117528.html ) . 
  the constellation leo was ( and is ) called ` jalopeura ' , noble deer . 
  the translator took the name from that . 
  think about implications . 
  instead of leos , the finnish horoscope has moose . 
  there are large differences in energy expenditure , that is true . 
  and there seems to be systemic underestimation of energy intake in [ interview research ] ( http://www.julkari.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/110839/thl_rap2013_016_%26sliitteet.pdf?sequence=1 ) . 
  i think this is much better than the interviews , according to them [ people are starving ] ( http://www.julkari.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/110839/thl_rap2013_016_%26sliitteet.pdf?sequence=1 ) : men 2243 , women 1733 kcal/day in finland . 
  tdee calculator gives 2944 kcal/day for an average guy ( 180 cm , 80 kg ) : https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=metric&amp;g=male&amp;age=30&amp;kg=80&amp;cm=180&amp;act=1.55&amp;bf=10&amp;f=1 [ finnish calorie counter ] ( http://www.laskurini.fi/terveys/kalorilaskuri/energiantarvelaskuri ) gives 3382 kcal/day ( but they consider moderate exercise as 1 hour running per day ) . 
  for me it is 4700 kcal/day . 
   this war must be swiftly ended through a democratic peace without annexations or levies !, 
  i thought this was question about 1917 russia , not what the german high command should do . 
  but it is good to see that all the parties were equally clueless and in denial , starting with bolsheviks . 
  well , you have always sounded like mika niikko complaining that equality has gone way too far . 
  did you follow the debate about the artificial insemination bill at all ? 
  can you honestly say that they gave any consideration to the ethical problems from the child 's point of view ? 
  from anyone else 's point of view but birth mother 's ? 
  the existing law allowed the surrogate pregnancy but required that the artificially inseminated child will have both mother and father . 
  the motive for the ban is simple sexism . 
  as for the personal risks , the pregnancy is not very risky . 
  we allow commercial fishing and flying , much more risky activities . 
  of course , the people taking risks are mostly men, 
  yes . 
  the law , in its majestic equality , forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under the bridges . 
  there is no natural barrier preventing surrogate pregnancy , either , just an oppressive , sexist and bigoted law . 
  oh , i read `` made in st. petersburg '' . 
  but yes , finnish-made . 
  it is atomic icebreaker vaigat\u0161 . 
  definitely not finnish ~ ~ nor finnish-made ~ ~ . 
  a finnish news article about the ship : http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5088649, 
  people on the top lost after 2011 ( i 'd guess no more juicy bonuses ) . 
  [ anne berner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anne_berner ) was also a third generation immigrant , she became finnish citizen in january 2015 . 
  finland had similar law after a foreign minister of finland called the then leader and chancellor of german `` mad dog who should be shot '' . 
  they have [ the accommodation ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/muenster_lamberti_koerbe_6428.jpg/800px-muenster_lamberti_koerbe_6428.jpg ) for the add leaders ready in m\u00fcnster . 
   the cost of manpower for instance varies widely . 
  that is true . 
  however , the effectiveness and productiveness of the manpower varies even more widely . 
  even if your manpower is dirt cheap in general , it might be worthwhile to fly in specialists and pay them handsomely , more than they could make in their home country . 
   usually most of the gdp is consumed internally . 
  that might be true in large and economically diverse countries , but smaller developed economies have imports/exports something like 40 % of gdp . 
  ppp reflects the consumer prices . 
  a meal in restaurant , a carton of milk . 
  however , the investment goods are usually priced same everywhere . 
  an engine for a power station costs roughly the same whether the power station is built in germany , russia or india . 
  gdp ppp per capita represents the living standard . 
  the ppp is calculated using consumer goods , not investment goods . 
  the nominal gdp represents the size of economy in total , how much it can invest . 
  what has railways got to do with a monopoly ? 
  they are not monopoly and despite competition , they are getting more and more popular . 
  compare db with uk railways . 
  where the number of passengers grows faster ? 
  yearly growth rate is 4.4 % in uk , 2,56 % in de since 2004 . 
  in ten years uk ridership has grown almost double the pace , 54 % , de ridership 28 % . 
  same thing with passenger kilometers . 
  passenger railways compete with buses , coaches and airplanes . 
  the long-haul coaches are great example , coach companies like onnibussi are competing with finnish railway monopoly vr and bringing down the prices . 
  we can also thank british rail privatization : those coach companies are from uk . 
  the current minister of transportation , anne berner , made a deal with vr to extend their passenger monopoly beyond the next elections . 
  the next cabinet might privatize railways for ideological reasons . 
  greens like public transportation . 
  edit : what is `` so '' that the next cabinet will do . 
  why it is bad idea ? 
  if the idea is to move people around , the british railways are doing great . 
  ridership and passenger kilometers are growing among the top in europe . 
  there is no credit card transactions and he had not made a cash withdrawal from his bank account since 1998 or so , or so long the banks still had records . 
   hell in ireland we 'd only have to go back about 15 . 
  that is overreaching . 
  st. patrick arrived 432 and cromwell 1649 . 
  he sent three e-mails , two in reply to e-mails from journalist , but forwarded plenty of angry e-mails he had received from angry citizens . 
  so the angry e-mails have been originally sent to sipil\u00e4 himself . 
  if some lying sonofabitch got people to send me tons of hatemail , i 'd be pissed too . 
  they are most probably real blondes with fake eyebrows . 
  my wife gets her eyebrows colored , because they are invisible in their natural color . 
    it ca n't get any worse for us but it can and it will . 
   the north of england is exactly like the rust belt in the us ... no jobs ... loosing jobs ... its depressing ... and as trump said those people have been forgotten ... 
  there was no county in england where unemployment was above 6 % . 
  that was not because the people were given up looking for job , but because the employment was at the record numbers . 
  that was the reason for immigration , companies either had to hire immigrants or try to poach already employed people . 
  it is christmas buck . 
  drinking hyperhopped ipas takes a toll on the taste buds . 
  * a * finnish etymological dictionary opinionated that it is unlikely loan because the aryans are more prestigious people . 
  yeah , right . 
  how we fix the situation ? 
  return all the celts and later migrants to near east where they came from ? 
  before plastic , they used paper and oil . 
  but back then there was not much external interference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twisted_pair#history the other element of modern phone line , [ loading coils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loading_coil ) ( also known as pupin coils ) were also invented at the end of century .
