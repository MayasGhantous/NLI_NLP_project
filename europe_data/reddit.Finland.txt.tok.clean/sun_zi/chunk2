  the private sector wages have followed . 
  the low-productivity jobs are disappearing fast . 
  the plan a was to increase the weekly working hours . 
  the mean weekly hours were reduced in the industry sector by giving extra days off ( `` pekkaset '' ) , so people with 40 hour week have 39 vacation days a year . 
  those days were supposed to be reduced . 
  wages would stay where they were , but the labour cost would be cut . 
  finnish industry would more competitive , no fiscal contraction , everyone would be happy . 
  unions did not want to do that , so we now have plan b. 
  they are denied entry to serbia , too . 
  wonder how large border zone they have between serbia and hungary ? 
  have you seen the border between finland and russia ? 
  what makes you think it is unfenced , lack of photos ? 
  after wwii , soviet union fenced the border in order to avoid defectors going west and spies going east . 
  unfortunately , this is only gun i 've ever fired : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/155_k_83 great fun , i must admit , however , quite expensive unless you are sponsored . 
  germany has not suspended dublin regulations . 
  dublin regulations mean that a member state has agreed to accept and process asylum seekers from other member states when they are responsible for the asylum seeker . 
  saudi arabia has [ plenty of syrian migrants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_workers_in_saudi_arabia ) , do n't worry . 
  they refuse to give asylum to any syrian refugee , however . 
  it prevents russia from making credible threats to its members . 
  there are plenty of arab workers in ksa : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_workers_in_saudi_arabia kuwait and other gulf countries have more syrians , those countries are extending their residence permits for the duration of the syrian crisis . 
  the title says immigrants , the interview talks about migrants . 
  gulf countries have a large number of syrian immigrants but they accept no refugees . 
  but is that just like in europe , where the far right argues that people fleeing the syrian civil war are migrants , not refugees ? 
  they now only have to find a country willing to receive all those deported refugees . 
  your numbers cover situation only until july . 
  the migration office released august numbers this week . 
  there was 1.891 asylum seekers from iraq in august , so they now make 46 % of all asylum seekers . 
  link somewhere outside the putinbot domain and we can talk about identifying pictures . 
  what about [ this ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/yks2pxkepca/maxresdefault.jpg ) ? 
  why do n't you link to his facebook page but instead some putin-paid bull shit site ? 
  according to a story in helsingin sanomat , an icebreaker built in finnish shipyards costs 150 m $ but the same icebreaker built in american shipyards costs 500 m $ . 
  no wonder they have lack of icebreakers . 
  they ** must ** show nipples on facebook in germany ? 
  there is already a fence with cameras in south . 
  drones would be nice , however . 
  what happened ? 
  germans sent a well-known troublemaker to russia via sweden . 
  we would call him a terrorist today . 
  he destroyed the interim government in russia and gave germans the peace treaty they wanted . 
  russians paid the price , however , the new regime promptly made them slaves and serfs again . 
  three french toilets in norway , titled libert\u00e9 , \u00c9galit\u00e9 , and fraternit\u00e9 and painted as tricolor . 
  `` the change came after new legislation enacted in 2011 . '', 
  wonder why yle makes a story about thing that happened in 2011 ? 
  in finnish language story they compared the allowances paid in finland , sweden , denmark and norway . 
  somehow sweden is different . 
  they give asylum seekers work permit as [ incentive ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/english/private-individuals/protection-and-asylum-in-sweden/adults-seeking-asylum/information-for-asylum-seekers-in-sweden.html ) to help with their own case . 
  and if they get a job , they can stay even when their asylum gets denied . 
  even if the immigrants do not get asylym , they can stay in sweden if they get a job while they wait for the decision . 
  they are preparing for 15000 asylym seekers . 
  those immigrants are leaving the eu ( so they can enter a richer part of eu , or so they hope ) . 
  do they arrest illegal immigrants leaving the country somewhere ? 
  macedonia is not part of eu . 
  they are supposed to help prostitutes , but they have negative effect . 
  they have deregulated buildings less than 25 sqm ( or 40 ? ), 
  in sweden . 
  at least a start . 
  a side-trip to tallinn by boat can be unforgettable experience . 
  if you survive it . 
  stalin wanted to kill poles because he thought they could have been a threat to his utopist state . 
  hitler wanted to kill jews because he thought they were a threat to germany ( remember the dagger stab theory ) . 
  somehow the distinction between them escapes me . 
  what about killing poles because they are poles ? 
  polish have no ethnicity ? 
  according to ptolemy , there are islands of great britain and little britain somewhere off northwestern coast of gallia . 
  in most countries taxes for next year are withhold from your pay . 
  if , however , you are self-employed , there is no pay which could be withheld . 
  so you can either save the tax money and pay all your taxes next year , pay in advance voluntary ( there is usually a modest interest benefit to do so ) or the tax office will invoice you with advance taxes . 
  i guess the greek system is being changed from save-and-pay-next-year to pay-taxes-as-you-go model . 
  your graph excludes services which consists of majority of greek exports . 
  he thinks that greek would be better off outside eurozone where their excange rate would rapidly devaluate . 
  here is his piece from 2011 : http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052748703864204576310851503980120, 
   now the right to be forgotten is just the same thing , namely the extension of property rights into the digital sphere . 
  it 's your information , it 's your right to decide what happens to it . 
  so if i write a newspaper article about you peeing in the fountain in front of town hall , it is somehow your property and you have right to decide what happens to it ? 
   well the biggest problem is he has no ability to see anyone else 's point of view . 
  he was bred and brought up by pasok . 
  in his woeld view everybody else were cronies , too , and if he just could make a deal with the big man ( or big lady in this case ) , everything would be fine . 
  nai vote so that syriza can shift the blame to the people . 
  [ plevne mar\u015fi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8m_0iad_to ) by a mehter band is pretty cool , it is from the russo-turkish war , too . 
  another cool piece is the mehter classic [ ceddin dedin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ergss6dzack ) . 
  so when imf declares that greek debt is `` unsustainable '' it just means that greece fails their artificial criteria ? 
  greek debt has been already restructured , many times . 
  bailout packages are where existing debt is rolled over as esm debt with much more favourable terms . 
  so the imf insistence on further debt restructuring is just weird weaseling . 
  ah , krugman has to resort to lying with exchange rates . 
   [ iceland took a brutal 40 % hit ] ( https://www.google.fi/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:lva:ltu:est:isl&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=1153515600000&amp;tend=1374440400000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) if you measure their gdp in `` current usd '' . 
  that is what happens when your currency ~ ~ devalues ~ ~ drops like a stone . 
  with `` real prices '' it does not look so bad , but icelanders are not happy with what they can buy with their kr\u00f3nur , if they get a permission to exchange them . 
  same old , same old . 
  it would be really interesting to hear what krugman has to say about latvia . 
  i recall there was a scandal in us in 1940s , but apparantly they continued until 1960s . 
  the practice was dropped in late 1940s . 
  there is 151 subway `` restaurants '' in finland . 
  however , the most popular fast food chain is kotipizza with more than 300 joints . 
  ( hesburger is about the same size , so in some comparisons it is bbigger than kotipizza , but that probably depends on how you count . 
  imf funds come with strings attached , and while they adore the money they they do not love those strings . 
  we had those last kind of plaques in helsinki , too . 
  the city ordinances had specific times tuesdays and thursdays for shaking rugs or linens . 
  i think you have lot to learn from the art of linking , heading and titling . 
  that is why they need others to take the haircut .
