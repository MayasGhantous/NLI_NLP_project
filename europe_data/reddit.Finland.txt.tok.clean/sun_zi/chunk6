  finnish prime minister matti vanhanen step down in 2010 because of knee operation , definitely not because his house was built with materials donated by thankful construction companies . 
  bollocks . 
  you can catch a thief and use necessary violence for that . 
  some simpletons confuse that with vigilance , vigilance is not allowed . 
  may i introduce you [ mary p. koss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_p._koss ) , an expert on rape that the cdc uses and self-avowed feminist . 
  she believes that in order to be raped you have to be penetrated . 
  cdc does not count forced sex as rape if the victim was made to penetrate .

  i would have guessed a sookurg is crane . 
  and it looks like a crane ? 
  oecd report ? 
   the goal was equality that has been a spectacular failure . 
  the finnish schools are most unequal in europe , just after bulgaria . 
  soviets prevented germany from winning the war , that is for sure , but did they really won the war ? 
  edit : shishkin answered this rather eloquently in his v-e day piece [ father , we lost the war ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/opinion/mikhail-shishkin-how-russians-lost-the-war.html ) . 
  swedish has two grammatical genders , utrum , * den * gender , and neutral gender , neutrum , * det * gender . 
  all people belong to utrum gender regardless their sex . 
  swedish has also sex-specific pronouns han and hon , just like english has sex-specific pronouns he and she while the language does not have gender or has only single gender , the common gender . 
  what they did in \u00c5land was add a third personal pronoun which does not indicate sex . 
  it shows the losses during ww2 . 
  how they are calculated ? 
  do they count finnish people that were evacuated from areas annexed to soviet union ? 
  ( and why it lists other soviet republics , but not the [ fenno-carelian one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelo-finnish_soviet_socialist_republic ) ? ), 
  do they count volkdeutsche that were evacuated in 1940 or expelled in 1945 as population losses ? 
  and what about baltic people that defected to west or perished in ethnic cleansing before 1941 ? 
  we have regional d'hondt with open lists in finland . 
  i think stv would be an improvement , perhaps with larger regions . 
  now parties swell their lists with all kind of celebrities and filler candidates [ who sometimes get elected ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96686/mitro_repo_home.html ) . 
  it is physically impossible to make a pill that reduces appetite and/or makes body use the existing energy stores ( read : fat ) more effectively ? 
  please tell me more . 
  i though it is grammatical english , too . 
  `` i do '' ? 
  they sure drink lot of carlsberg in ~ ~ england ~ ~ danelaw . 
  except denmark got kicked off from scandinavia already in 1600s . 
  looks like turisaz is pretty pissed on putinists in kaliningrad . 
  what has 6 legs and smells of vodka ? 
  polish may day parade . 
  all the boring people get a bullet and nice people will be having fun . 
  negotiations have not really even started , the parliament has just elected the various committees . 
  however , even now it seems that soini is not in control of his parliament group . 
  i think we have another six-pack in making ... 
  they provided the quality leadership that without question contributed most to the defeat of germany . 
  or perhaps the greek housewives do not work at all . 
  what do you do if you stimulate 2 -- 3 years but nothing happens ? 
  when you can say that the stimulation does not work ? 
  when you run out of money ? 
  perhaps somewhere where they drink from thimble , but finnish pint is 1.332 liters . 
  a quart ( of pint ) is 0.33 liters . 
  finnish police classifies mc night wolves as a criminal gang . 
  putin has so close ties with the club that he got himself added to the police database of people associated with organized crime . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) , prices in poland are 33 % lower than in usa . 
  irish prices are 8 % higher than in usa . 
   there 's something about lidl ( and aldi ) specifically that they like for very long time , lidl did not accept but cash and old-fashioned debit cards . 
  you should probably look at the 1897 map on the wikipage . 
  muscovites were majority in two towns , sevastopol and feodosya . 
  tatars were expelled after wwii when stalin blamed them for co-operation with his former allies . 
  if i understand it correctly , australia sends the would-be migrants to some islands that do not belong to australia . 
  i think this is great idea . 
  there are a few islands in europe that are not part of eu , most notably channel islands and \u00c5land . 
  we should set up the camps for the refugees there , compensating the poor islanders in suitable manner . 
  the would-be refugees will definitely be discouraged by the inhospitable weather of the islands and return to their warm homelands . 
  only if you do not apply the modern definition of slave in any historic situation . 
  yes . 
  he was lucky . 
  parties need roughly 12 500 votes for a single seat , but finland is divided in 13 voting areas and parties usually lose or gain the last seat in the area . 
  jabba lost 37 000 votes , but lost only 1 seat in one area . 
  greens gained 40 000 votes and won 5 seats in 5 areas . 
  national coalition lost 60 000 votes and lost 7 seats in 6 areas . 
  sdp , -72 000 votes , lost 8 seats in 6 areas . 
  the center party won 162 400 votes , 14 seats , in other words they needed 11600 extra votes per seat while greens got theirs with less than 8000 votes per seat . 
  in helsinki , coalition party got 93 000 votes and 6 seats while greens got 68 000 votes and 5 seats , difference of almost 26000 . 
  if the coalition party would had received 1042 votes more in helsinki , they would have gained one seat from jabba . 
  also , greens would have got one seat from jabba if they had 360 more votes in uusimaa next to helsinki . 
  so jabba happened to won at least 2 of tight races . 
  ( perhaps there was some even tighter situations elsewhere , but these two are largest areas and last counting their votes , so i kept doing the math during counting . ), 
  if it is possible to have radically conservative parties , our both `` leftist '' parties would be great examples of that . 
  they both want * progress * , but that progress is just returning to 1970s -- time when they or their parents were young : kekkonen , state price and wage controls , state owned conglomerates , soviet union . 
  did i already mention kekkonen ? 
   they are the conservative party for fucks sake . 
  they are flaming commies when compared to sfp/rkp . 
  yes , it is probably the combination , both main coalition parties have now trying to score cheap opposition-like victories for several months . 
  but the question is , how exactly voting center is going to help here ? 
  they are supposed to be very good at coalitions ? 
  it is not culture , it is the real estate law . 
  the stairway is not owned by residents , but they pay tax to a local serving company that is supposed to take care of it . 
  `` local '' meaning that there is one serving company in leningrad oblast , another around murmansk , etc. 
  the 7-bit gsm alphabet supports ( some ) greek letters in addition to ascii . 
  in the ancient times when nokia was the ~ ~ basileus ~ ~ wanax , it was the only choice . 
  later there was also 16-bit ucs , but it required 16 bits per each letter , much more expensive ( like several ~ ~ cents ~ ~ drakmas per messages ) if you used it . 
  yes , just like nokia is registered trademark of nokia . 
  microsoft is allowed to use it until the end of this year , just like tcl communication and atlinks can use alcatel . 
  it would help if you spelled out what you try to say . 
  nokia sold their handset division and gave microsoft some licenses to use `` lumia '' with their phones . 
  they still have the mobile network business . 
  nokia buying lucent and alcatel has nothing to do with microsoft or georgia pacific or other companies making toiletries . 
  alcatel-lucent does not make mobile phones , they make mobile networks . 
  do those prices include sewage fee ? 
  in helsinki , it is 3,00 $ / m ^ 3 including the sewage fee . 
  in our co-op , the usage is metered and we paid less than 10 $ / month per person per month for both cold and hot water . 
  we have [ mora taps ] ( http://www.moraarmatur.fi/ ) which let only pitiful amount of water to pass .
