  as a comparison , the cost per person was something like 15 $ per month in our previous flat where the usage was unmetered and we had ordinary taps , and that cost only covered the hot water . 
  if you look at things worse than hitler , the company and british raj are good contenders in the top five . 
  nazi germany crushed france and bankrupted british empire and his net contribution is probably positive for most of the people living now . 
  it was an official statement . 
  according to other official statements , there were no russian troops involved in crimea , nor there are no russian troops in eastern ukraine . 
   it 's kind of both as it 's designed to be an official retreat for a head of state . 
  it was private home of alfred kordelin , donated to finnish university fund after his death . 
  fund exchanged it to something more useful ( money ) in 1920s . 
   crumbling concrete it may be that i do n't know english well , but they pillars do n't seem to be concrete , but something ( probably wood ) covered with plaster . 
   overweight = = `` mostly healthy '' the optimal weight where you have least heart problems is around bmi 19 , but the overall mortality minimum is in `` overweight '' range in 25 -- 30 bmi . 
  i understand that physicians and health professionals do not keep much noise about it as the heart problems used to be ( and they still are in finland ) the # 1 killer for the working age people . 
  those are people welcoming american troops , a token which shows that usa is serious about its promises . 
  the presence of american troops ensure peace . 
  your picture shows mobilized german troops marching to war . 
  in your picture , people are overjoyed because there will be war . 
  in the other pictures , they are relieved . 
  there will be peace . 
  he is from southern helsinki . 
   i addressed this in my other comments . 
  90 % of the bailout money ( taken from european taxpayers and poor greeks ) went down the drain , into a black hole of an insolvent banking system . 
  it did not achieve anything . 
  it is a fallacy to think that if greece had defaulted , it would have had to have borrowed just as much , only under worse interest rates . 
  all the greek banks would have been tits up , the greeks would have lost their savings , the economy would have halted . 
  everything would have been on fire sale . 
  unemployment would have been closer to 80 % than 70 % . 
   a lot of forced migration happened in the past in poland , which has never happened in america the american counties with the best soil have the blackest and poorest people . 
  it is tempting to say it just might have something to do with forced migration . 
  perhaps we should ask great britain ( or what ever they call themselves nowadays ) as a third partner . 
  perhaps also estonia should participate as the successor state of soviet union . 
  24 cans of koff iii costs 19.90 $ . 
  after you deduct the taxes and can refund , the shop and brewery make less than 2 $ . 
  less than 8 cents per 0.33 l can . 
  `` lady parts '' ? 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_profanity#synonyms_and_metaphors_3 ) ` vulva ' means womb , i think ` lady bits ' is appropriate translation . 
  definitely . 
  you should start honing your swedish skills , though . 
  it is the american version of democracy . 
  `` no taxation without representation . '', 
  usual riff-raff . 
  british and other english-speaking countries have great difficulties in anatomy . 
  they think that women pee through their vagina . 
  this was visiting helsinki a few years ago : http://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/home i was really damn curious , i 've never seen a vagina and i was wondering is it even possible to make a cast of it . 
  so , imagine my disappointment when i saw just a wall full of plaster cunts , no vagina in sight . 
  i thought they just slap `` neo '' to the front of reforms . 
  in eastern finland this is is `` en kehtaa '' pronounced bit like `` emmy\u00f6 ny kehtoo '' . 
  but the hohenzollern castle is exactly the same ? 
  that is because it was not civil war but a not-so-proxy war between germany and their bolshevik puppets in petrograd . 
  in finland people working 40 hour week get extra 12,5 days off per year , total 37,5 days . 
  public sector workers gets extra 13 days off totaling 38 vacation days -- and all those with holiday bonuses , so if they want to change bonus to vacation days they had 57 days off per year . 
  even if prostitution it is not illegal , it is not legal either . 
  police can and will deport prostitutes , it will report them to social workers , the social service will remove the kids and take over their custody , the landlord can and will terminate the contract and evict prostitutes ( unless they really really want get charged on pimping ) . 
   this is not a reality anywhere though , even in countries like germany , there are many trafficking victims . 
  they are so many victims that german trafficking-blamers have to claim that they are elsewhere in europe . 
  like in finland , according to german sources there are several thousands of trafficked prostitutes here in finland . 
  what did you do not understand ? 
  my point is that sex and grammatic gender does not correspond in german . 
  * weib * is ** a ** word meaning woman and it has been ** the ** word for ** wo ** man until 1800s . 
  there is one grammatic gender in english . 
  there is no gender in finnish . 
  but this has nothing to do with swedish , which has gendered pronouns * den * ( for utrum gender ) and * det * ( for neutrum gender ) and then sex-specific pronouns * han * ( for men ) and * hon * ( for women ) . 
  they have also loaned finnish pronoun * h\u00e4n * as a personal pronoun * hen * that does not specify sex . 
  `` was will das weib ? '', 
  -- `` what does the woman want ? '', 
  in german pronouns are gendered , in english they are sex-specific , in finnish we do n't have gender nor sex-specific pronouns . 
  swedish has everything : den/det are gender-specific , han/hon sex-specific and hen sex-inspecific . 
  also in breaking news , the reichkanzler adolf hitler announced that he will offer a non-aggression pact to both austria and czechoslovakia . 
  ^ ( this is a bit old . ), 
   the notion of a 14 year old marrying someone in his 30s or older would never be allowed , i imagine . 
  times change . 
  we have a 34-year old mp ~ ~ and former minister ~ ~ in finland that got her first kid when she was ~ ~ 15 ~ ~ 14 . 
  father was then in his 30s . 
  the prosecution dropped the case in august , a new prosecutor opened it after a review request by the complaints ' attorney . 
  he left sweden after prosecution dropped the case . 
  areena had copy of the direct bilingual broadcast . 
  there were two commentators , one in finnish and one in swedish . 
  when president spoke in finnish the swedish-speaking commentator commented and the president was muted . 
  the was a problem with the broadcast and finnish audio stream was labeled as swedish and vice versa . 
  in yle newsclips the speech was given intact . 
   i support closing our borders at least temporarily do you have some kind of difficulties to comprehend niinist\u00f6 ? 
  start reading from `` there is an explanation for this . '', 
  teutons were mentioned by strabo ( died 24 ad ) , saxons by ptolemy around 150 ad . 
  just curious , did the police had `` usual suspects '' to haul in ? 
  in a finnish case a couple of years back the police managed to detain a few migrants before they got the cc recording of the alleged attack . 
  accuser was seen on phone with her boyfriend before a short roll in snow and another call to boyfriend , who then insisted in getting the police to the scene . 
  they did factor income but not the education or socioeconomic status . 
   yes , but these benefits only go to a small subset of the population ( 10-20 % ) . 
  this proposal would be to give it to everyone - multiplying the cost by 5 or 10 times . 
  most basic income or negative income proposals have provisions of raising the progressive taxation so that the benefits do not affect net income for most people . 
  of course there are always complications , progressive tax rates for capital gain are very hard to enforce efficiently . 
  how the social security is administered in switzerland ? 
  in finland we have something like 6000 people working in central government and little fewer working in local government . 
  you probably have social security bureaucrats working in cantons , too , but how many people you can actually employ that way ? 
  the poverty line is defined by the social assistance actually paid to poor swiss people ? 
  the germanic loanword meant `` wedded wife '' . 
  bastards had em\u00e4 but legitimate children had \u00e4iti . 
  in most of the eu the benefits are tied to working , not residency . 
  the social benefits are supposed to be given to all people * working * in the country . 
  if a finn gets a job in britain and moves there , he is supposed to get child benefit from britain , not from finland ( even if he leaves his famiiy behind in finland ) . 
  finland do restrict the benefits to new arrivals who do not work , but it can not ( and do not ) restrict benefits given to people working here and their families . 
  net worth , not wealth .
