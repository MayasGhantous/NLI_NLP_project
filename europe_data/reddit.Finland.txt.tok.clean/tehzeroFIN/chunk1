my uneducated rural dad once bought me a confederate flag when i was younger . 
  it 's a nice flag though , i probably still have it somewhere . 
  nah , we were exploited , not the other way around . 
  i hate people like you who think every european country is the same with colonization , imperialism and slaving others and then demand some apology for that . 
   `` lying media '' or `` you are not allowed to talk about immigration '' that would n't honestly surprise me . 
  [ or there are so many of them ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/poll-reveals-40pc-of-muslims-want-sharia-law-in-uk.html ) . 
  political correctness was one of the factors so yes it 's relevant . 
  it was called g8 but they dropped russia for certain reasons . 
   fascist v antifa you mean fasists vs fascists ? 
  * ad hominem *  when used inappropriately , it is a fallacy in which a claim or argument is dismissed on the basis of some irrelevant fact or supposition about the author or the person being criticized . 
  [ this is what i woke up to . 
  it 's true , my middle-aged dad was stabbed to the head when he was drinking at friends house . 
  are we monarchy now or why it shows our pm rather than president ? 
  based farage . 
  just wait until the isis islamic caliphate annex malm\u00f6 . 
  i think you 're speaking of patriotism ? 
   a nazi-movement was spreading among certain boys . 
  what the fuck ? 
  we have/had amis , short for ammattikoulu ( vocational school ) , back in the day vocational school vs high school was more poor vs rich thing , amis would usually learn trades related to cars or other manual labor . 
  they wear caps with beer brand names on it or something equally tacky , favorite hobbies include drinking alcohol , driving shitty cars that had music system probably more expensive than the car itself , `` tuning '' , courting under-age teenage girls etc. 
  music of choice was 90 's eurodance/hardcore like cascada , scooter etc. , everything with lots of bass , this music is now called amispop . 
  amis subculture still exists today but it 's not as popular as it were years ago , weekend nights you can still hear amis cars drive by with loud bass , it sounds something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrv0qdifyzk ) . 
  popular youtube group/whatever made a [ music video about them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meupiomejk4 ) . 
  women who wear skimpy clothing should also be relocated to different area , just in case , yeah ? 
  metro2033 satisfies that urge . 
  funny way to spell snus . 
   misconception : the flats are stolen from people . 
   not true . 
  the owners receive compensation that 's like me stealing your bike and throwing you 5 $ . 
   approaching winter makes tents next to impossibly if we could do it in the arctic circle , i 'm sure you can do it as well . 
  land of always winter, 
  bitches please , [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/vsuciux510m?t=6m34s ) was the real nightmare fuel . 
  you are weak , sweden must be exterminated . 
   the fact that some refugees/immigrants make the extra effort to come to finland instead of turkey/greece/etc . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp3ficdl22i ) you go . 
  greece is n't gon na give them money like we are . 
  like 20 of them have already returned to sweden because this is n't such a great place after all . 
  `` hello i 'm gay christian , give me welfare '', 
  i 'm glad . 
  refugees , go back to sweden . 
  i was more wondering about the placement of estonia , denmark and netherlands . 
  wtf is that map ? 
  why do n't you force us to pay them ? 
  do you honestly believe we need to import labor in 100-150 years ? 
  are n't they gon na say that anyways ? 
  there should be point where claiming to be insane does n't matter anymore . 
  expenses come from the bureaucracy , right ? 
  people like breivik are pretty clear cut case . 
  no need to spend money wondering if he 's actually innocent or not , just hang him . 
  just do it . 
  where 's the missiles ?? 
  you cowards ! '', 
   `` you 'll never take us alive !! '', 
  what the fuck ? 
  yup , you 're either with us , or against us . 
  people need to understand that merkelunion is blood in , and blood out . 
  i will never ever understand why people would want to hunt with spears rather than rifles/shotguns . 
   i would never stay in a building where i knew there were any that 's idiotic , most guns are stored in locked cabinets/other safe places . 
  reasonable force is when they are on the ground and ca n't get up anymore . 
  if someone would suddenly attack me , i would run away , but if i had to fight , `` reasonable force '' would be the first thing flying out of the window . 
  but you can pass them to latvia . 
  there 's nothing 20 good men ca n't stop . 
  haha what ? 
  santa lives in sweden !, 
  yes refugees , go to sweden !, 
  no santa in finland , nothing , not even welfare !, 
  sweden !, 
   sweden will then try to ship these people to a rural area so as to not make their ghetto problem worse . 
  actually they just put them into trains that are going to finland . 
   bretons are the descendants of either an aldmeri-nedic or aldmeri-atmoran hybrid race of the 1st era and are consequently termed as ` the mongrel race of tamriel ' . 
  their elven blood is heavily diluted , due to their ancestors intermingling with the nordic population in skyrim and high rock . 
  [ feels finnish man .

  possible terrorist attacks ? 
  lmao that racism smh . 
   why would i live a small rural state when i could be living in new york ? 
  are you 15 year old girl ? 
  `` you have a weird accent for a refugee from middle-east '' , `` what do you mean you ca n't speak the language of that country ? '', 
  do you cease being civilized if you resort to violence as the only mean of survival though ? 
  oh , that makes sense then . 
  kicking families out to make room for refugees should n't be a problem . 
  no , but when things get desperate , even the civilized people will resort to violence to get what they want . 
  how does that matter , and what 's your point ? 
  imagine the same situation but you and group of people go explore catacombs beneath the fine art museum . 
  you get trapped and help is coming in a few weeks because they are busy with refugees . 
  you are at the center of civilization , just underground . 
  what now ? 
  i would burn my own house down rather than just leave . 
  sure it 's easy to say that when everything is fine . 
  imagine if your plane crashes in some remote area , after gathering the survivors , you think it 's a great idea to have the food rationated . 
  few of them disagrees and says the food belongs to them , they are n't interested in what you have to say and they 're ready for violence . 
  would you rather starve or start beating the shit out of them ? 
  nah , just poking fun of when people say how europeans enslaved africans , when they really mean just few countries . 
  i remember that day when we had slaves . 
  good old times yeah . 
  define civilized then . 
  we have more than enough unemployed people . 
  surprise that people do n't want another group to pay for . 
  ah yes , everyone can either create robots or fix them . 
   civilized people it does n't take much for the ordinary civilized people to take a stick and start beating the shit out of someone they do n't like .
