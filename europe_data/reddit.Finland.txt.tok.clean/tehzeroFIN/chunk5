  not really , but you guys annoy me sometimes . 
   nationalists are fucking idiots . 
  that 's rude . 
  there might also be some other reason why women ca n't compete . 
  what about them ? 
  i believe most of them can speak the main language of the country they 're living . 
  i think it 's more about the language we speak + geography . 
  icelanders are n't scandi 's either . 
  no i meant that of the refugees we have , like 5 % are syrian . 
  we have our own problems to deal with . 
  and syrians represent like 5 % of the refugees we have . 
  most of them are iraqis on some europe sight-seeing tour , plenty of them have already left because this is n't a wonderland after all . 
  add rapes committed by them , constant fighting in the refugee centers , and lots of whining on their part . 
  that 's 30k too many if you ask me . 
  we have about 30k . 
  your thinking is a little creepy . 
  lol i fucking wish we had only 750 to 1050 . 
  can we add estonia ? 
  need alcohol . 
  is it like in finland where literally every political party fucking sucks ? 
  [ look red ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/conscription_map_of_the_world.svg ) for conscription , not that i know exactly how it 's done in those countries , but conscription is a thing in many countries . 
  i remember one winter night , near the arctic circle , i had to sit outside with a radio headset on in case someone would call ( nobody did n't ) , and the wire on that was so short that i had to sit on my backpack , could n't move at all . 
  just sitting there for hour or two , i was shivering the whole time , too dark to see anything , tired as fuck . . then the hallucinations came . 
  fun times . 
  in finland you are n't forced to join the army , you can do civilian service , or unarmed military service if that 's the problem . 
  in finland you can do civilian service instead , you get send to help schools/hospitals etc. 
  did my conscription last year and did n't notice any hazing , not saying there is n't , but nowadays there 's pretty clear 0 tolerance for that kind of stuff . 
  it was an issue when my dad was in the army , and they literally had some fight clubs in the parking lot before weekend holiday officially ended . 
  just guys beating the shit out of each other because they served in a different branch . 
   it 's basically mandated slavery , where the government exercises its right to own its citizens and deprive them of their freedom against their will . 
  is n't that like school ? 
  yeah , you can start your conscription in the summer or in the winter , ( roughly 6 months between ) , those who become nco 's get to train the new guys . 
  it 's our pronunciation that 's terrible . 
  you need someone to build the wall if mexicans back out .

  that picture shows total gun deaths were lower in 2013 compared to 2008 ? 
  what 's the point of this article ? 
  majority of gun deaths are suicides , that 's much better way to end yourself than head-on collision with a truck , another popular method . 
  [ russian diplomacy now ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/k+from+rome+total+war_9b2fc9_4162073.png ), 
  yup . 
  are we gon na let in every poor person ? 
  or just take few of them and imagine we made a difference ? 
  `` guys , i went to europe and got 400k $ !, 
  how amazing is that ? '' . 
  incoming refugees . 
  finnish lapland has more santa clauses than swedish one though . 
  sorry but that 's just retarded and you know it . 
  sweden is n't that stupid , this is a long-term plan . 
  think few decades to the future when these guys might start paying taxes and working as engineers and whatnot . 
  [ american ] ( http://assets.dwell.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_photo/public/2014/04/22/nevada-suburb-aerial-photo-ciphers.jpg?itok=nexqlncd ) [ suburbs ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/30/1e/82301e3406c0f330efe7e59b8ba65bba.jpg ) though i quite like [ this ] ( http://www.photographsofthewest.org/education/content_photos/hirez/123.jpg ) picture , like an oasis in the desert . 
  they might be afraid of other men after being raped by men . 
  what about males that are raped by males ? 
  should they be put in women 's section ? 
  but that would be too spooky for women . 
  thanks for the history lesson , i meant fair as in white . 
  there has been plenty of rapes in finland , fights and stabbings in the refugee shelters . 
  when cops go to break up fights , they get no respect from them . 
  there was an article some weeks ago how cops went to refugee shelter and got surrounded by `` angry men '' , had to use gas to get out . 
  yea yea not everyone is like that , but not everyone is some poor syrian who wants only to get to a safe place . 
  is n't that what hitler said ? 
  you mean copied from that one guy who actually did his homework ? 
  dream big . 
  what 's next ? 
  let me guess , borders ? 
  thanks , but no tanks . 
  do it like we did in the military , applause lasts only 2 seconds . 
  of course , but antifa folk have their own definitions on who is a nazi . 
  `` nazis '' meaning everyone we do n't like . 
  to be fair , everything is incredibly expensive . 
  our president [ on airspace violations ] ( https://youtu.be/knp2vj2yfgu?t=3m22s ) . 
  is n't your conscription selective ? 
  there was an article about how many gays are voting for fn too . 
  he could 've joined a pmc if he wanted guns and dangerous situations . 
  or you know , just travelling . 
   what will happen once these populists come to power ? 
  in finland 's case , nothing . 
  i guess singapore could be one . 
  but i think even their quasi-dictator said that you ca n't integrate muslims or something along that . 
  and i doubt you 'd be willing to adopt the `` break the law = get fucked '' system . 
  [ teaser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svabpir0wls ) , add some zombie noises . 
  there is short tv show ( i think 3 episodes ) called generation war/unsere m\u00fctter , unsere v\u00e4ter . 
  it 's from german perspective and on the eastern front , it 's more of a drama than war film but i recommend it anyways . 
  [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmygpx23px4 ), 
  i just think that winter would be kind of boring . 
  99 % of the scenes would look like [ this ] ( http://sofrep.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/winter-war-finnish-ski-troops.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.flamesofwar.com/portals/0/all_images/modelling/sculp-finns-02.jpg ) ( in color ) . 
  compared to scenes form band of brothers , [ here ] ( http://www.highdefdiscnews.com/screenshots/band_of_brothers_8.png ) and [ here ] ( http://hboasiaweb.s3.amazonaws.com/band-of-brothers-e3-t.jpg ) . 
  i mean yeah , unfair comparison but still . 
  i do n't think winter would be that nice fit from aesthetic perspective when it 's just that , snow . 
  not sure if you could make it an exciting tv show . 
  snow everywhere and people in winter camos crouching in a foxhole or skiing around . 
  there are no/very few innocent people on those videos , and it seems like those people had no intention of actually trying to kill as many as possible . 
  in the 2nd video , do n't you think it 's a bit ridiculous that you have dozens of cops and they all back off then the crazy person walks towards them ? 
  so if a person with heavy clothing and a mask would run around stabbing people ( and not stopping to taunt police ) in a pedestrian heavy area , the cops would actually charge at him ? 
  and let 's say there 's only few cops at the scene , not an small army of them . 
  i do n't wan na bring gun policy to this , but that seems like very inefficient and dangerous for all parties . 
  discussion about armed police ? 
  remember to use only us and uk as your examples . 
  are your police actually trained to attack a person with knife ? 
  what if he would wear clothing that prevented tazer working properly and would run after those other people ? 
  if eu were to become a super power , we would need to be more unified rather than everybody being independent .
