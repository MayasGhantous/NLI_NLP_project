  they are in nato so i think they 'll be safe even if they were n't in eu . 
  and what kind of response is that anyways ? 
  latvia joins eu for economic and whatever reasons , then you say `` we 're gon na merge into a unified country and be a super power , you do n't like it ? 
  well then why are you even here ? 
  get the fuck out '' . 
  [ kia crowd ] ( http://www.theemotionmachine.com/wp-content/uploads/ingroup-outgroup.jpg ), 
  i 've seen quite few feminists , or `` feminists '' complain that egalitarians do n't do enough to promote womens rights and so on . 
  are you saying that they would n't let highly educated and wealthy norwegian guy immigrate to sweden ? 
  we should 've been internationalists and joined the soviets . 
  well , nazis were national socialists so ... 
   meme [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/6/69/jokela-school-shooter.jpg ) is what average finn looks like .

   who added that he wanted to see if asylum seekers should be automatically deported if found guilty of serious offences . 
  yes yes yes, 
  can finland into baltic ? 
  how 's your feminist foreign policy working ? 
  terrorist stole my bike once . 
  in the evening it was still there on the yard , but inte morning - gone . 
  i ca n't believe that this kind of terrorism exists where i live , and quite frankly , i 'm scared that it will happen again . 
  we have an island reserved for you . 
  [ wait for our air force .

  it 's 18 % , i know you hate everything right-wing but get over yourself . 
  i remember back in the day in finland we used to look up to you , even little me was upset that i was n't born swedish , where the streets are gold and you get paid actual crowns if you recycle soda cans . 
  now it 's like wtf is happening . 
  welcome to the club !, 
  how many of them are `` sleeper agents '' ? 
  just because only one had syrian passport does n't mean there are n't more terrorists planning attacks/waiting for the greenlight . 
  i 'm not gon na say that `` probably 20 % of refugees are isis '' or something , but it is a possibility that there are more of them . 
   would be bad for the future eu careers of our politicians . 
  [ when you get a job at eu after fucking shit up locally . 
  it will become popular , i swear !,

  have you already tried changing your name to like , simeon judenberg or something ? 
  yeah i 'm sure those living on welfare all live in middle-class houses that have 3 bedrooms . 
  end result of nationalism for me is that i get to live in an independent country . 
   one of the three families left to germany shortly after their arrival to czech republic , now allegedly living in a tent in germany sure beats free housing , medical care and schooling for your kid . 
  why not ? 
  people get visas for playing in nhl , why should esports be any different ? 
  nice trivia : brits actually bombed one of our ports to show support for their ally , the soviet union . 
  finnish voluntary ss battalion was never accused of any war crimes and most joined because they just hated commies . 
  [ one of them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lauri_t%c3%b6rni ) later joined us army and fought ( and died ) in vietnam . 
  visa issues come to mind . 
  so maybe germany and sweden should stop this `` spread the refugees to other eu countries '' thing , you would n't want them to live with us racists . 
  makes sense , if your uncle or friend is in germany , it 's only logical to move the whole family there , instead of you know , them coming . 
  dad , please , do n't you have a radio show to listen to ? 
  i 'm not sure if you 're a troll or not , but refugees should n't even be given money , unless they work for it . 
  refugees need safe place , bed , water and food . 
  this is okay , but if you start demanding more money than the rest of the people and demanding better food and better places to sleep , you 're not refugee , just ungrateful asshole . 
  well did the german working class have to compete with immigrants for their jobs ? 
  yes . 
  we should pay for everyone . 
   those kids growing up as refugees right now are going to be the generation which will have to rebuild syria and that is going to be damn difficult without a half decent education . 
  go back ? 
  why ? 
  living in europe is so comfy . 
   german heavy-metal band rammstein , which has been accused of racist and fascist sympathies is it because they sign in german ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they had song that implies they 're left wing .

  that list is wrong because reddit told me that asian countries are n't innovative . 
  se\u00c5l . 
  leading role huh ? 
  this is the stuff that fuels conspiracy theories . 
  i 'm not saying they have no right to do that . 
  but it feels very counter productive to punish universities for what their government is doing . 
  estonian . 
  i think most people are just saying that this is pretty retarded . 
  i vote that sweden does n't cut the welfare for immigrants . 
  i 'm not , but stop bullshitting how hard the times were for you . 
  you sat out the war , did n't lose anything , and thousands of finns moved there for work . 
  [ sweden 's hard times ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg ) . 
  stop bitching , you did n't share a huge border with soviets , you did n't have to fight , you did n't have to give up parts of your land , you did n't have to rebuild it after the war and pay debts . 
  i 'm glad that sweden does n't have conscription anymore , you might hurt yourself . 
  what has conscription to do with this ? 
  and yes , i know about accidents , they happen here too . 
  go ahead , call saudi arabia , i do n't give a fuck . 
  [ it 's working !, 
   selective immigration ? 
  = =  that could work , but it 's against the worldwide right of being equal as a human . 
  haha , what the fuck ? 
  there is literally nothing wrong with selective immigration . 
  try to understand that not all humans are equal , and you have no right to just walk into a country and claim that `` i can live here because i 'm human '' . 
  poor sweden , that sure was hard time for them . 
  many iraqi `` refugees '' here have already returned to home countries as well . 
  i guess this is some sort of europe tour for them . 
  hmm , i think that 's good enough of a source for me to label them as nazis . 
  if we need immigrants , could we try chinese next or something ?
