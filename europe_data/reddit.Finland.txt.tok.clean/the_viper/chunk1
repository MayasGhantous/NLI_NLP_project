i was going to say what a lightweight since it 's 55 % or nothing for me but than figured it was n't the most appropraite turn of phrase, 
  haha , i guess russia does n't like finnish butter though . 
  can we stop upvoting this euromaidan ** pr ** it 's not news or factual but hard propaganda, 
  so much so i even hear poland is a sucker for blowjobs, 
  you do know the americans authorised `` first strike '' as well . 
   ** for nuclear weapons states and non-compliant states : **  the u.s. would use nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the united states http://www.webcitation.org/6fy0ol07h es , our allies and partners, 
  that sucks so bad , reminds me how i ran up 100 euro 's of an overuse bill while i was just home for the christmas period . 
  government is a joke , if they had any balls they would force these companies to provide unlimited use contracts but unforunately they bow doen to big business every time . 
  the only two countrys i can think that operate data useage caps are ireland and the usa and we all know how backward the latter has become . 
   52 $ / month wow , i pay $ 15/mont for the same cable deal with saunalahti cable, 
  wow , i guess they still got that `` 3 '' national broadband scam going where they got paid shitloads to provide coverage for the whole country but save money on infrastructure by rationing everyones use with a data cap . 
  that was my one of my last straws before moving to finland . 
  the first day was 20 open tabs streaming porn at once i tells you . 
  good i wish the eu would do the same an we could all be better off . 
  let ukraine sit in their own stew, 
  i 've heard it said , bird pooping on you means good luck is on it 's way . 
  a russian who posts 90 % of the time in / r/ukraina / i 've heard it all now, 
  why do you wear russian flag flair when you are clearly ukranian . 
  worst attempt at psy-op 's ever by the looks of it . 
  `` hey look i 'm russian and disagree so something something putin hulio ... ... ! '', 
  yes and every few years the irs settles with an agreement to only tax x % on profits repatriated . 
  yes only now the us is starting to give out after whole corporations decided to reincorporate as irish and pay all ( or more likely zero ) tax there but while ireland was operating as a doorwar for american corporations to operate in europe and funnell the money back home it was all good . 
   and how are these things the us/europe pushing ireland around ? 
  i did n't say they are pushing them around , i said ireland does as they are told like rushing through rush legislation to make bank debt to sovereign debt at the request of the eu . 
  nope i work in it / software development with 10 years experience at this point , could easily have a job in ireland but i disagree with the bailout/politics and general status of `` us vassal state '' ireland has become to the point i said fuck this shit and left . 
  sorry to say but ireland has no backbone as a country and nobody with foresight thinking 5/10 years ahead while our politicians barely succeed at managing the present privatization and sell-off of state assets . 
  as soon as we got rid of the british we just copied their judicial system and started doing as we were told by the us/europe to the point our neutrality does n't exist anymore . 
  there was never any brand ireland , if we were n't so backward thinking we could have a real tech boom since we are perfectly located for data centers but that takes cheaper ( nuclear/hydro ) power . 
  then you have our squandered gas reserves ... * now i 'm starting to rant * but i see no future there , jobs being created on the basis of being a tax haven and no development of infrastructure which is not sustainable and that 's before the debt, 
  i totally agree although i left ireland because of that bullshit attitude of laying down for the us and i fear many others who care might have done the same, 
  it 's still wrong and propaganda but i should expect no less from a guy called pladmir_vutin who posts pro-ukranian articles all day, 
  in that case just marked it to watch later on . 
  i sure hope so, 
  something something , slavic women, 
  i ca n't watch 40 minutes now , any chance of a tl , dr i did however watch this one called `` flipping out '' which shows the drug fueled year off conscripts go on in india and other cheaper non muslim regions of the world . 
  spoiled brats getting fucked up to help their self inflicted ptsd was the only thought that came to mind . 
  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkbwbk_flipping-out-israel-s-drug-generation_lifestyle unless it turns out they are all brainwashed i do n't think i 'll be gaining any sympathy for the idf, 
  another version of ths video is titled `` huge rebel armored vehicle column driving through rovenky '' who is telling the truth . 
  sorry to hear things are that bad . 
  sounds like my version of hell . 
  do you think these are the type of people we want in europe ? 
  i do n't know about the young generation but i always feel the old types need o die off before any country can really change it 's ways . 
  these guys are the perfect example, 
  or we would just edcuate people to not have so many kids . 
  it 's not like feeding the ever exploding population is good for our planet in long term anyway, 
   it seems like many europeans do n't understand we are still locked in an ideological war against an alliance of authoritarian post-soviet states you just never stop with the red threat fearmongering do you, 
   did you know this site has an actual subreddit for farming , where actual farmers will tell you many of them are happy with monsanto products ? 
  you mean the subreddit 's full of monsanto shills searching reddit 24/7 for any opportunity to defend their beloved company, 
  russia wins again, 
  best britain, 
  you are such a propagandist , good thing i got that article of yours in worldnews removed . 
  i 'm going to make a point in following you around now and keeping tabs on rule violations, 
  i suggest you search `` worthy and unworthy victims '' by chomsky this is just hte media building outrage to use as political capital against russia . 
  frankly i find it appauling but everyone seems to lap it up and worst thing is it works too . 
  this is how they start wars, 
  oh wait now i get it  redditor for 1 month comment history entirely full of anti-russian posts . 
  guess you just came on here today to use a disaster to selfishly push your own agenda, 
  why are your replies so rude and off the point , you sound like a rambling drunk unable to address anything i say, 
   do you speak russian or you 're just a useful idiot ? 
  no need for the ad hominem is there buddy . 
  why would i speak russian when you can clearly see i am speaking english . 
  are you seriously trying to tell me the ukraine not not lied in the past . 
  i 'm only quoting one of the more hilarious cases where they made up some elaborate story to cover their air strike that killed a load of civilians . 
  point being they have not earned our trust, 
  i agree but the language used is unprecidented in my opinion and seems to be designed more to fuel hate . 
  the guardian for example `` mh17 : armed rebels fuel chaos as rotting corpses pile up on the roadside '' i fully get they are trying to illiustrate the point but how is that sort of headline taking into account the mourning of those familys who are not presented a mental image of loved one as a rotting corpse, 
  typical redditor `` botson bomber lynchmob '' and it 's also being fueled by western media right now with the language they are using . 
  in all reports now about this plane crash we hear strong words appealing to emotion like `` rotting corpses piled up on a roadside '' and to put this in context you will notice the equal number of deaths in gaza get no such language used . 
  noam chomsky 's piece from manufacturing consent on `` worthy and unworthy victims '' piece will open your eyes to this sort of thing and i cant help but feel it 's designed to demonize russia and russians in the eyes of the audience, 
  i just posted about this in the thread where they are asking `` ordinary russians '' about how they see the state . 
  people can cry and say , well they are just presenting fact etc etc but when you ask leading questions and have the opportunity to only publish the replies that suit your own agenda it 's just as likely to be full blown propaganda . 
  just so everyone knows , radio liberty was a setup by the cia as a cold war propaganda platform . 
  before the insta downvotes , it 's well documented http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_free_europe/radio_liberty, 
  agreed, 
  great quote but i agree 100 % . 
  small states like ireland and finland need to always play both sides or risk being dominated by one or another . 
  right not both have lost their sovereignty and have been pretty much absorbed by the usa/eu west although i feel it 's pity he chose to cosy up with another power structure known as the church and helped destroy the socialist movement in ireland in his days, 
  well that 's how you see but i tend to respect what esko aho ( link to him discussing ukraine and current fin-rus relations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vmkyakc3sc ) has to say here in that small countries should not be playing politics anyway and accept that they must be molded by the stronger powers around them . 
  there should be no `` sides '' in this and to think we are no longer reliant on russia is foolish at best , finland should simply do what 's best for finland the natural gas power plant next to my house which gives me hot water and electricity does ' t get that gas from fairies or do you have a better solution for our heating an electricity needs ? 
  these borderline neo-con capitalists in helsinki these days seems to have no idea off the past, 
  policy all through the soviet era called to say they disagree, 
  assuming you trust ukraine did n't lie about it all . 
  how many times have they claimed rebels blew themselves up by now i wonder ? 
  so all of a sudden we trust ukrainian after all the lies and half truths . 
  and lets not forget the whole rebel manpad striking an air conditioner incident and blowing themselves up incident, 
  i will grow a lot more once the imf get their teeth in, 
  and that is why finland should do as she has always done as a small country and keep her head down and not take sides at all, 
  going well in iraq is n't it . 
  such american support, 
  oh yes of course , mother germany must be repaid . 
  10/10 , would annex, 
  what , the battle against factual titles ? 
  the `` back to russia '' part, 
  zerohedge is a pretty well know site, 
  such fact 's , many wow . 
  care to elaborate on where you got your intel ? 
  i think to think logically like you just did there as well because this has happened before and nothing came of it . 
  it just surprized me how the reddit hivemind gets themselves so whipped up lets hope someone does n't come out with some crazy evidence like the boston bombings shitstorm . 
  i hate to whatabout but would people really be as outraged if isis used captured american tech from iraq/syrian rebels to do the same thing ? 
  ... because they keep fighting the rebels and wont just agree to let them seperate not because he thinks they did it .
