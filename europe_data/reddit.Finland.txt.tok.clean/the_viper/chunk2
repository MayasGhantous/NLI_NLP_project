  put your statements in context man, 
   this is clearly just a media spin move aimed at shaming eu into more action ** thank you ** all i see is american war hawks using this to their advanatge already just like the post 911 hysteria they have no shame . 
  i sure hope cooler heads prevail and we show them how to act with dignity after a national disaster . 
  `` europeans have to be the ones to take the lead on this . 
  there should be outrage in european capitals . '', 
  - fucking warhawks using this to their advantage . 
  reminds me of the post 911 crazy talk , while it 's terrible i sure hope cooler heads prevail none the less, 
  guess you got the berlin propaganda grant money then ... 
  surprise , surprise who the big winners are ... and that 's before we factor in the loss of sovereignty to multinational corporations, 
  how about also slowing down the migration from these non eu states while we get jobs for the double digits that are already unemployed, 
  if there is still a euro left in 2015 ... 
   of course it was meant to be propaganda , but it was very skillfully done . 
  is n't the propaganda you ca n't tell is propaganda always the best . 
  still does n't change the fact it 's propaganda  to make sure that they would n't try to ask for a real people 's government , but to accept the new leadership made out of former apparatchiks . 
  sounds to me a lot like what is going on in ukraine today , one olligarch replaced with another, 
   rferl is pretty decent journalism and does a good job removing itself from the conflict . 
  what are you talking about , they are pretty much an american , cia funded propaganda arm . 
  so i do n't what has changed in the last few years  they were founded as an anti-communist news source in 1949 by the national committee for a free europe , as part of a large-scale psychological operation during the cold war . 
  rfe/rl received funds from the central intelligence agency until 1972 . 
  [ 5 ] during the earliest years of radio free europe 's existence , the cia and the u.s. department of state issued broad policy directives , and a system evolved where broadcast policy was determined through negotiation among the cia , the u.s. state department , and rfe staff .

  yea but cd/record stores have all but been destroyed . 
  the only way to adapt was to move into a totally different buisness area . 
  in this case bookstores need to become nothing more than warehouse/distribution centres . 
  seems they also have a problem with iran now too .

  i admit it 's a total clusterfuck up there but in my view this is more a public `` ignition '' of hatred so to speak . 
  individuals acting out and commiting criminal acts which are widely condemmed by all but the perpetrators and a few sympathisers is a bit different from having a mass public event where everyone gets together to gather around the fire and share in their hatred which is tolerated it would seem . 
  you get what i 'm saying ? 
  all these marches and flag burnings are very provocative so i 'm not exactly surprized when the other side continues to do terror attacks . 
  both need to stop altogether . 
  you know what i mean ? 
  edit : prime example of what i mean ... http://i.imgur.com/0iygcpd.jpg, 
  think wal mart and the death of the high street . 
  that 's where it 's going and yes i am very much in support of france on this, 
  typical american article , free market capatilism is best even though we all know where it eventually leads . 
   ** they have the world 's highest rates of social mobility ** : in a comparison of social mobility in eight advanced countries by jo blanden , paul gregg and stephen machin , of the london school of economics , they occupied the first four places . 
  ** america and britain came last **, 
  / s required, 
  where are these big irish fires burning english effigies ? 
  ah the yearly showing of ignorance and anti-irish attitudes, 
  actually it 's better to have more handrails and standing space on trams with just a few seats for the old and fat . 
  from another angle it looks fine to me . 
  [ at least it does n't have a tape deck/cd player ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kpzvbkx.jpg ), 
  i think you are totally wrong , while i cant tell if that man is in line with the front of the tram the lowest point looks no more than knee height and in any case way to low to force a car under it http://i.imgur.com/i9xs7f3.jpg, 
  i guess everyone in russia must be driving on of these then http://i.imgur.com/6moesk5.png, 
  in fairness the eu is gone crazy on health and safety . 
  and less wires hanging from the roof too http://i.imgur.com/l7d6jtm.jpg i think you need to realize these are still in the factory and finishing touches like handles are not added yet . 
  off with their heads, 
  why is that ? 
  if they are to be banned than the nazi svoboda party should be banned too . 
  than start with right/pravvy sekktor, 
  source for that claim as it sounds like psudo science bullshit to me ? 
  fuck the eu as well right . 
  can belive we call these sadists allies . 
  i 'd much rather we do business with russia at this point , at least they are an emerging power rather than a declining empire . 
  the thing i alwasy wonder is , where are all these people willling to work in such an immoral role . 
  is america really gone that bad they you will sell your soul for a few dollars and a salary, 
   three is a mobile network who when they came to ireland had no infastrucure and had to rent from o2 and vodafone until there aquisition of o2 ireland earlier this year and was not a part of the national broadband scheme not involved you say ? 
   following the conclusion of a competitive tendering process , the contract to implement and operate the national broadband scheme ( nbs ) was entered into with `` 3 '' ( a hutchison whampoa company trading as 3 ) on 23 december 2008 http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/communications/communications+development/national+broadband+scheme.htm they did it with the worst possible implementation i have ever seen and covered up the lack of infrastructure with `` data limits '' to make sure every person uses the network sparingly so that they could meet the quota of proving 2mb access to everyone ( which they barely did anyway ) the `` broadband scheme '' ended up akin to a government sponsored rationing book to give everyone a certain amount of access to a very underfunded network . 
  in comparison where i am now in finland i can have unlimited mobile broadband access for 8euro per month ( 2mb ) / 15euro / ( 10mb )  also this new scheme is a landline scheme and has nothing to do with the mobile network . 
  i 'm aware of that , i just hope it does n't end up a farce like the last one . 
  i ca n't find any information on whether or not this scheme will come with any `` data cap '' attached so will remain skeptical until i read otherwise, 
  as i see it bitcoin can take power back from the banking institutions and return it to the people and if regulated correctly can actually return sovereignty to states which have had it eroded by the need to bail out zombe banks . 
   virtual currency industry could diminish a bank 's ability to influence the overall economy 's price of credit . 
  so in other words they cant manipulate the market anymore ? 
  my heart goes out to these poor bankers / s  at the end of it all , according to murphy , bitcoin and other virtual currencies will become a bank 's worst enemy . 
  at least he is being honest there but on a serious note , does anyone here actually see bitcoin as any sort of `` threat '' and as i suspect , is this in fact bankers starting to scaremonger and try to protect their own asses as usual, 
  if you read my post again you will see i was referring to the farcical `` national broadband scheme '' that allowed three to get away with minimum investment since by imposing data caps they are forcing users to limit their activity and load on their own network and so less load means less need to invest in the infrastructure to support the requirments of 1mb for everyone . 
  put simply it was a scam and in the end it was more of a token genture national broadband scheme . 
  of course they would say that to try and save face [ exclusive : cia had role in germany spy affair ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/07/us-germany-usa-spying-cia-iduskbn0fc21920140707 ), 
  considering how terrible their last great `` national broadband scheme '' worked out i wo n't get my hopes up . 
  and already their claims are untrue because there is already faster networks in the eu so in three years i expect this to be eclipsed . 
  ireland is one of the only countrys i know that still implements this punitive system of data caps and huge charges for overuse, 
  because nobody needs to spend the crazy amounts the us spends on defence . 
  europe combined already is the worlds second buggest military . 
  that will do fine thanks, 
  so it was the europeans giveing out sub prime government backed mortgages to people who could never possibly repay and then got the rating agencies to give them aaa ratings so the debt could be shipped off overseas ? 
  or do you have a bettter explaination, 
  cough cough , ttip, 
  do i really need to quote the casulty figures . 
  on average a palestian child dies every three days at the hands of israel over the past 13 years https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/6185-one-palestinian-child-has-been-killed-by-israel-every-3-days-for-the-past-13-years, 
  would have thought an internet warrior like yourself who follows people around accuring them of being part of some white pride group would at least have the forsight to screencap your proof . 
  oh well , keep showing yourself up as a fool , i 'll be happy to assist, 
  link me just one post from / r/whiterights there / u/donvito and i 'll go down with my ship . 
  oh wait you cant because there is none . 
  now stop embarrasing yourself, 
  oh wait , i thought only russia can do propaganda right / s lobbying and this sort of manipulation of personal opinion is nothing more than bribery plain and simple, 
  sticking your head in the sand and pretend it does n't exist , well done sweeden , top notch policy you got there / s, 
  not really a lot of far right swing to the crazy american liberatarian side as well as the socialist side . 
  when it comes to forign affairs i would say as many are anti-american as are pro, 
  or the germans are just cleaning up the story to save face, 
  welcome to the next bailout folks , given the boom/bust nature of the american economy this should be hitting late 2014/early 2015, 
  when you consider france 's unfunded liabilitys going into the future they pretty much are in economic collapse ( like most of europe ), 
   how similar are far-left and far-right you threw me with saying how far left and right are similar unless you mean the various forms of far left and right in each state . 
  oh and most pople in the far left are not `` communists '' as you like to phrase it , in the say way not everyone in the far fight is literally hitler, 
  if that 's all you can take from it , you clearly ware n't listening very well, 
  thats politics , colours do n't matter , think about how the republicans and democrats are pretty much the same thing in the us . 
  when you represent something against the status quo of the bankers , boys club expect blank stares, 
  talking about russia like it 's something to be carved up and dicided upon elsewhere is exactly what 's wrong with the west .
