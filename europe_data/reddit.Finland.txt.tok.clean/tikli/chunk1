as i said earlier , feminism deals with all gender inequalities , including men 's issues . 
  or at least , should . 
  but no , i have never been to the united states , and i claim no expertise about the particular gender issues you face . 
   you 're still assuming something i do n't accept . 
  i 'll give you something to think about , from finnish perspective . 
  finnish girls outperformed the boys in all categories in the pisa study ( that is , reading , science , maths ) . 
  this sparked a discussion here , if our education system is failing the boys , even if the gender differences were still minimal . 
  but the studies that looked into the issue revealed something else : the teachers were actually favouring the boys , giving them better grades for less work , and one might argue that this perhaps even unintentionally caused them to be outperformed . 
  but all that being said , we also have a disparity regarding the women and stem fields in universities . 
  and this is something that should be carefully studied , to understanding * why * that is . 
   do you expect parity ? 
  that is to say is your goal , and do you expect , 50/50 distribution ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  even in a perfectly egalitarian society some disparity is to be expected . 
  but as it is , we 're still far from that . 
  what i do believe is that that the gender stereotypes and biases are harmful to the society , and that there should be serious effort in trying to erase them . 
  ( hell , i had the power , i would do away with the whole concept of gender roles ! ), 
   you mean like more women than men being in university ? 
  well , i was referring to women and stem fields , since we were talking about the after effects of patriarchy . 
  but absolutely , all gender inequalities should be adressed . 
  the same concept applies in both cases , we should carefully study what are the societal factors in the equation , and what exactly is needed to even the field , so everyone can reach their potential . 
   but in doing so we 've forgotten about our boys and allowed them to very much so fall by the way-side in different ways . 
   but we should better enable all peoples to achieve their dreams and address opportunity limiting factors specific to certain demographics . 
  and now i 'm confused again . 
  you seem to think that feminism is about artificially uplifting one gender at the expence of another . 
  equality between the sexes is simply trying to even out the socio-enomical variables ( and in the lesser extend , historical baggage ) affecting both genders . 
  while i do agree that patriarchy as a term does n't apply to western societies anymore , we 're still battling its remnants , e.g. 
  gender bias in the education and the unequal representation in the governmental bodies and in the business sector . 
  your second point i frankly do not get . 
  are you seriously arguing that the differences in the testosterone levels and the brain structures justify the remaining inequalities in the social , legal and economical workings of our seemingly egalitarian societies ? 
  note that i 'm not disputing the biological differences , just your implications about them . 
  feel free to read [ this study ] ( http://www.psych.rochester.edu/people/reis_harry/assets/pdf/carothersreis_2012.pdf ) . 
  ( pdf warning ) also , please do n't project your personal issues about the 3rd wave feminism onto other people . 
  i 'd like that as well . 
  i just happen to think they 're going the wrong way about it . 
  if you think the women in femen do n't consciously exploit their sexuality , you are either really na\u00efve or willfully ignorant . 
  well , i did n't claim to be an expert , it was just my impression . 
  it was n't even the architecture ( trust me , we have more than enough soviet-like apartment buildings and even cities here , [ kouvola ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fjeslan.jpg ) comes to mind ... ** shudder * \\* ) , but how run down the districts seemed . 
  crossing the river made feel a bit like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvjs_c1u6zs ) ( please excuse my bad sense of humour ) . 
  i do n't get their agenda . 
  they 're fighting patriarchy and sexual exploitation of women ... by sexually exploiting themselves ? 
  i mean i 'm all for feminism and i do n't mind an occasional nude protest . 
  but what are they hoping to achieve ? 
  that people see their breasts and think : ` well i * do * like boobs , so i must like what these women are saying ' ? 
  riga is a seriously beautiful city . 
  the old town was quaint and charming , and since i love art nouveau , i thought the rest of the city centre was even prettier . 
  it kind of reminded me of helsinki ( without the medieval parts of course ) , and there was a familiar `` feel '' to the city . 
  that being said , i also saw a glimpse of the neighbourhoods on the other side of the river . 
  the contrast was pretty striking . 
  so while i personally do consider you guys to be part of northern europe , i can see why some people still think otherwise . 
  i see your zwarte piet and raise you [ tiernapojat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_boys%27_singing_procession#finland ) , our version of star boys ' procession and one of our most cherished christmas traditions . 
  the characters in the play are king herod , the king of moors , herod 's servant and an angel . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gypmm0fxeto ) a rock version of it , with the traditional blackface and all . 
  sometimes the role of king of moors is played by a black person . 
  but this also leads to some awkwardness , since the play is medieval , and there 's a line where herod asks the king of moors why he 's black . 
  then the king of moors sings some cringy lines about his skin colour . 
  but then again , the play has n't changed at all since the 19th century , and this is also very obvious since it uses very archaic language and contains a praise for [ tsar alexander ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_ii_of_russia#encouraging_finnish_nationalism ) . 
  the wood he was burning was from a dead tree . 
  we call them [ kelo ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/snag_ ( ecology \\ ) ) , and they 're usually pines or spruces . 
  edit . 
  well , it is n't exactly a secrect that finnish school model was based on swedish and gdr models in the early 70 's . 
  what i find funny is that the arguments for why finnish ( or gdr ) type of education could n't possibly work in germany is so similar to american 's . 
  `` they 're so homogenous , students there all speak finnish , they only have a population of 5 million etc. '', 
  the so called ` comparing apples to oranges ' - approach . 
  what they do n't seem to get that even if you ca n't just cut and paste the entire education system and expect it to work , you can - and you should !, 
  - implement the working bits and pieces , and mold them to fit your population , your nation . 
  but no , let 's just discard everything , [ because it could n't work ] ( http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_23322-544-1-30.pdf?110713143340 ) ( pdf - warning ) . 
  finnish version of werewolf is kinda funny , since they were called ** vironsusi ** , which means estonian wolf . 
  it 's not known if it really refers to estonia , or if it simply is derived from latin word for a man * `` vir - '' * ( as is english * were - * ) . 
  but estonia also featured heavily in our folklore about werewolves , so it could be both . 
  vironsusi was usually a person cursed to be a wolf . 
  sometimes a bride ( or even whole wedding party ) was cursed by a jealous ex-suitor or a future mother-in-law . 
  touching iron or eating bread usually broke the curse . 
  finnish mythology has a bunch of interesting creatures , but since some of them are loans from sweden ( like tonttu , our version of [ tomte ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomte ) , or [ n\u00e4kki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neck_%28water_spirit%29 ) ) , i 'll focus on more unique paranormal entities . 
  the most important creature is [ ** haltija ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haltija ) . 
  haltijas are the base of finnic mythology - they range from vague spirits to elf-like creatures and all the way to god-like beings . 
  most haltijas are guardian spirits of beings or places , and they can offer help to people if asked in the right way . 
  in modern finnish `` haltija '' also means owner , or holder . 
  ** v\u00e4ki ** ( folk , power/strenght ) is a word to describe different types of haltijas , but also the magical power they possessed . 
  does n't mean `` folk of women '' , instead it refers to magical powers only women possessed . 
  there are * mets\u00e4n v\u00e4ki * ( folk of the forest ) , that means all the haltijas of the forest , ranging from tapio ( king of the forest , a god ) to less powerful entities , like * emuus * . 
  ** kotihaltijas ** ( haltijas of home ) were most common . 
  they lived in the homes , or in saunas or in barns , and they were very helpful if people took good care of them . 
  ** emuu ** or emo ( mother ) is an ancestral being of plants and animals , but some diseases and objects also had emuus . 
  bears have their own emuu , hongatar , as do foxes ( k\u00e4reit\u00e4r ) , trees ( kati ) and so on . 
  oddly enough , worms and willows share an emuu ( kyt\u00f6l\u00e4inen ) , but dogs ( ulappala ) and wolves ( \u00c4im\u00e4t\u00e4r ) do n't . 
  people used to pray to these spirits before hunt so they would grant their children as prey . 
  gods are the most powerful haltijas of their domain . 
  i already mentioned tapio , and he had a wife , mielikki . 
  then there 's vellamo ( also veen emonen , the mother of water ) , ahti ( the god of sea and fishing ) , ukko ( also perkele , the god of sky and thunder ) , and many more . 
  ** kalma ** or kalman v\u00e4ki ( folk of death ) were either haltijas or power of death , but could also refer to the dead ancertors ( * vainaja * ) . 
  ancient finns after all venerated the dead , their forebears . 
  ** hiisi ** was a place of worship . 
  it also meant `` sacred '' . 
  when christianity arrived in finland , hiisi and perkele both were forcibly changed to mean demons and devil . 
  and then there 's ** maahinen ** ( haltija of the ground ) , ** tulen v\u00e4ki ** ( folk of the fire ) , ** aarni ** ( a guardian of treasure ) and many more . 
  a person also had their own haltijas , as parts of their soul . 
  soul ) according to karelian folklore was given to a person at the moment of birth by a bird . 
  that 's why birds were considered sacred , especially water fowls , and people carried bird pendants around their necks so their soul could n't get away while they slept . 
  the swan was the most sacred of all birds .
