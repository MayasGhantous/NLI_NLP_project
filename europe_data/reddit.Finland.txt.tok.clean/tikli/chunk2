  nature ) and ** itse ** ( lit . 
  self ) were also parts of soul . 
  luonto was similar to guardian angel in christian mythology , while itse was a type of shadow self , and could even leave the person . 
  ... and this post got really long , and i barely scratched the surface . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsh-dhtrmmy ) the mayday call and the rest of the radio traffic subtitled in english . 
  our president gives a televised speech on a new year 's day . 
  it lasts about 10 minutes , during which the president discusses events that happened last year and the challenges about to come . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb2nlt8ckpk ) this year 's speech ( in finnish , obviously ) if anyone is interested . 
  that 's the point he was making . 
  every home is properly insulated here , no matter what , because it 's simply the matter of life and death . 
  he did n't mean it was your fault , but that it should be ( and should have been ) common sense to build homes in a way that they can shelter people from all kinds of weather . 
  what 's more baffling to an outsider is that this happens * every * year !, 
  but as i said , it 's not your fault , but it is the fault of the british government for not enforcing stricter building standards . 
  i would n't read too much into it . 
  first of , the article is a translation , some nuances might 've been lost . 
  also , merkel is n't some omnipotent queen of eu some sceptics like to paint her as . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't particularly like her , nor her politics , but the matter of ukraine 's admittance into eu wo n't rest on her shoulders . 
  no matter what , that time is still years into the future and will be a joint desicion of eu nations . 
  most likely merkel wo n't be even the chancellor then ( or at least i hope so , she 's been in power for too long now ) . 
  not finland ( or estonia ) , that 's for sure . 
  pacius ( the composer , a german immigrant ) just nicked his favourite drinking song from his former home country and just honed it a bit . 
  needless to say , i 'm not a fan . 
  finland does n't really have official anthem , though . 
  * maamme * might be the de facto one , but it clearly pales in comparison to [ * finlandia hymn * ] ( http://youtu.be/5pqmw8uqyzw?t=5m23s ) . 
  france 's anthem might be my favourite , it 's very difficult to beat la marseillaise . 
  i also like the anthems of italy , austria and spain , but this is simply because i 've heard them so many times after f1 races . 
  every citizen of finland has a national health insurance , paid by taxes . 
  the hospitals and such usually also charge small sums for appointments and treatments . 
  since the municipalities and hospital districts in finland are highly autonomous , it 's up to them to decide how much , or if anything , to charge . 
  ministry of social affairs and health have determined guidelines , though . 
  these are the maximum sums the public hospitals and clinics are allowed to charge : doctor 's appointment - 14,70 $ per visit or 29,30 $ per year emergency medical service fee - 20,20 $ ( may only be only charged between 20-08 on weekdays , and on saturdays , sundays and public holidays ) hospital visit - 29,30 $ hospital day care payment - 16,10 $ per day surgery - 96,40 $ continuous treatment ( like dialysis or chemotherapy ) or rehabilitation - 8 $ per appointment ( but can only be charged 45 times a year ) everything else is free , like nurse 's appointments , vaccinations , maternity clinics and such . 
  almost everything is free for children . 
  even if you use private health care services , kela ( = social insurance institution ) will compensate some small part of the bill . 
  there 's also a payment cap , but i could n't find the exact figure . 
  i recall it was about 700 $ per year , after which they ca n't charge you anything anymore . 
  edit . 
  you usually end up paying only first three fees , and after that it 's free for a year . 
  kela will also compensate medicine costs ( 30-60 % depending on the drug , and there 's also the same payment cap ) . 
  if you ca n't afford any payments , kela will cover them for you . 
  [ shire ] ( http://sebastianwikstrom.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/yapb_cache/0909_the_shire1.d3o8k505pqg4g0kso8gc4gwow.9jp9mn2wo3s4ks4gwooc48g.th.jpeg ) from lord of the rings ? 
  nope , some old warehouses in [ suomenlinna fortress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomenlinna ) , in finland . 
  it 's the bricks . 
  they look too even and smooth , too modern . 
  the buildings themselves look oldish . 
  if they would be covered in plaster , they 'd be more likely to pass as european . 
  this continent seems to love plasterwork . 
  well now you know what to do next , 
  i really should travel more ... http://imgur.com/ypfwne6, 
  take down what ? 
  the hill ? 
  it 's solid bedrock , which contributed to why it was left as it was back when they built those surrounding buildings , i think . 
  nowadays though it 's protected . 
  that place is a part of the history of the city after all . 
  a morbid piece of history perhaps , but history none of the less . 
  or if you meant the concrete memorial , that 's just there to mark the former ( presumed ) place of the gallows . 
  i do n't think it disturbs the people living there . 
  they used to hang people there from middle ages to 18th century . 
  its old name was `` gallows hill '' ( or galghabergit/hirttopuum \u00e4ki in swedish/finnish ) , though nowadays it 's known as kerttulinm\u00e4ki ( from st. gertrude ) . 
  that `` some piece of public art '' / u/dvlifm mentioned is actually a memorial .

  the fire is bad enough , but look at the blue-green algal blooms in baltic sea !, 
  i did heard from the news that there were almost record amounts of cyanobacteria in the sea , but i did n't realise it was that bad !, 
  depressing image , really . 
  sort of relevant .

  beauty is in the eye of the beholder , i guess . 
  he might not be ugly , but he 's not exactly good looking . 
  he just looks way too much like a [ jan van eyck ] ( http://www.oceansbridge.com/paintings/german/jan_van_eyck_007_obnp2009-y02672.jpg ) [ painting ] ( http://www.friendsofart.net/static/images/art1/jan-van-eyck-portrait-of-giovanni-arnolfini.jpg ) . 
  even the [ ladies ] ( http://hoocher.com/jan_van_eyck/isabella_of_portugal.jpg ) . 
  this is really interesting . 
  how do those people who really believe in such propaganda see russia 's heroin problem and the hiv epidemic ? 
  are they just ignored or are people in denial about them ? 
  or are they pinned somehow on europe/west ( as in : the addicts have succumbed to `` european lifestyle '' or something like that ) ? 
  the reason i 'm asking about this is that in the propaganda poster the needle was on europe 's side , and while i certainly ca n't argue that europe does n't have its share of junkies , the problems of the heavy drug use seems to be at least more pronounced in russia . 
   people are afraid to initially open up to strangers and show emotions if that 's what you mean . 
  but with friends or once introduced people are quite cheerful . 
  i think you mixed up oppression and depression . 
  unless i 'm getting a monumental * whoosh * here . 
  if so , just tell me and i 'll shut up . 
  otherwise , opression is  prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control , or the state of being subject to unjust treatment or control depression on the other hand is the mental disorder concerning the lack of energy and the difficulty of maintaining interest in life . 
  i love cider and white wine . 
  real cider that is , usually imported from uk , not the kind of overly sugary rubbish they call cider here in finland which is basically just a mix of wine , apple juice and artificial flavours . 
  ick !, 
  normally i just drink water and milk . 
  and coffee of course , and sometimes green tea with honey . 
  gl\u00f6gi is great too , in winter . 
  i hate to point out this , but i think it makes the world of difference in the real political workings of the world .

  tell me about it . 
  we 're still in depression though : /, 
  oh yes . 
  but luckily the government decided that in future it 'll be easier just to follow your example . 
  about time if you ask me . 
  we also use `` kyt '' , so * kolmekymment\u00e4 * would become * kolkyt * . 
  that 's the downside of using so long words : nobody has the time or patience to pronounce the whole word !, 
  haha . 
  that 's just cheating , you big cheat you !, 
  :d you did n't overcomplicate your language by forming * spoken * and * written * version of the same thing , so everyone just says it like ( slight regional variation excluded ) * kolmekymmentkaks miljoonaa viissataa kolmekymmentnelj\u00e4tuhat seitsem\u00e4sataa viiskymmentkuus * see ? 
  not that different ,
