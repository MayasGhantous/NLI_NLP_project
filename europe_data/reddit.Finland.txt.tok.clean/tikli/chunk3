  really ? 
  that 's really interesting considering how late christianity arrived in estonia , and how long maausko managed to survive . 
  i knew * maarahvas * ( people of the land ) was how estonian people used to call themselves before there was a estonian word for `` estonian '' . 
  is ristirahvas ( or maarahvas ) still used in some context ? 
  also , funny thing how in finnish * rahvas * is kinda negative term for peasantry or ( uncivilized ) common people ( we use * kansa * instead ) , but in estonian it 's neutral term for people . 
  oh finland has lots and lots of pre-christian traditions . 
  even the supposedly christian traditions have sometimes muddled and mixed with the older traditions . 
  like officially midsummer , or `` juhannus '' , is a christian holiday in honor of st john the baptist , but in reality the name just got tacked on a pagan festival . 
  we celebrate midsummer with bonfires , drinking , sauna and spells . 
  yes , spells . 
  usually fertility spells , but also spells that tell the future ( though those are more common in the new year 's eve ) . 
  here 's few : collect seven ( sometimes tree , five or nine , but always odd numbers ) different wildflowers while naked and place them under your pillow . 
  in dreams you will see the one you will marry . 
  wearing only your nightshirt , sweep the floor of your bedroom and carry the dirt in the hem of your shirt to a pond . 
  on your way home , you will meet the one who will become your beloved . 
  at the crossroads of three roads , sweep the ground naked , and your love will appear . 
  in the forest , lay in a bed of ferns . 
  seeing a fern bloom will bring good luck . 
  if you collect the bloom , you can even become invisible . 
  and lots of more , usually involving running around naked and seeing or finding your future husband . 
  the most common spell is casting of tin around midnight on the new year 's eve . 
  the shape , shadow and the texture of the tin tells what to expect during the following year . 
  [ this is how it 's done . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_mzualzgos ) then we have easter bonfires , christmas sauna , night of the ancient fires ... basically most of modern holidays have retained some ( or all ) of the older traditions . 
  finland is a euro dependent export driven economy which mainly exports to europe , and europe is still just recoring from depression and economical crisis . 
  it 's no wonder that finland 's economy has n't grown much last years . 
  not that we should n't try to fix our economy , but blaming just taxes and the government spending is a gross oversimplification . 
  i know !, 
  this whole ordeal is just so full of back room deals and sheer mockery of democratic progress . 
  why on earth did they allow citizen 's initiatives if they wo n't even try make it look like they care about them ? 
  exactly !, 
  and the whole legal committee vote was so full of shit it 's almost unbelievable !, 
  i mean two sdp pro-gay marriage voters being late or absent and their vote being cast by another person ( who was not only against the proposal but also a member of another party altogether ? ), 
  and then the shit queen herself , arja juvonen , who was vocally pro-gay right during her election campaign , but still voted against the first proposal , because it was `` against the usual way of passing bills '' . 
  she said the that she would have voted for it , if it had had majority of parliament backing it . 
  and now , when she gets a second change and there was no conflict in the way the bill had entered into the legal comittee , she 's not there to vote at all !, 
  and of course her substitute votes against !, 
  in the end , votes were 10-6 , but if the sdp members would have been there , it would have been 9-8 against . 
  and if arja juvonen had kept her word , the bill would have passed 9-8 . 
  ( of course true finns would have never allowed that to fly , and her absence may have been ordered by the party so that she never even got the change to vote against party line ... ) sorry about the rant , and all the swear words , but this whole thing just makes me so angry !, 
  well , it 's not certain . 
  the problem is that the marriage law would 've gotten rewritten to better befit the finnish law , if it would have passed the legal comittee . 
  apparently there are some gaping holes with the proposal . 
  now that the old cunts in the committee refused to pass it , it goes to parliament voting as it is , flawed and all ... that means most parliament members will probably vote against it , even if they would otherwise support the proposition . 
  not that the law wo n't pass in the end , but it might not be next fall . 
  perkele how i sometimes hate this shit ass country !, 
  sw finland : mostly swedes , estonians , asians , some brits and russians . 
  all nice enough , i suppose , except the russians . 
  i work in retail . 
  oh god the russians are annoying . 
  they usually come around christmas and early january , and they really like to go shopping . 
  the problem with them is that they rarely speak english , are often rude and loud , ca n't use toilets properly ( always leaving a big mess behind !, 
  ) , and they try to haggle !, 
  also , the americans try to make small talk with me . 
  that just makes me anxious . 
  i do n't get the purpose of pointless , inane conversations that never go anywhere . 
  true . 
  plus it was a conveniant tool to control native populace . 
  all the ruling class/people had to do was to `` prove '' that the natives were too uncivilized and unitelligent to govern themselves . 
  this happened all over europe and the world ( e.g. 
  with the english and the irish , and with the baltic germans and the estonians ... and of course even more with colonialism ), 
  the `` finno-ugric are mongols '' - joke is based on scientific racism of the 19th and 20th centuries . 
  this is from 1920 's * encyclopaedia britannica * :  finns are a strong , hardy race , of low stature , with almost round head , low forehead , flat features , prominent cheek bones , eyes mostly grey and oblique , short and flat nose , protruding mouth , thick lips , neck very full and strong ; - complexion also somewhat brown . 
  most likely who ever wrote that never saw any finns since no one in their right mind would describe our complexion as `` somewhat brown '' . 
  but back then , everybody linked linquistics with racial theories to justify wildly different morally questionable [ practices ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_racism#nordicism ) . 
  the logic behind it was also pretty weak . 
  in the case of finnish , it was : `` not an indo-european language ? 
  ca n't be european then . '', 
  thus finns were considered `` mongoloids '' . 
  shh , that 's just some kind of fascist nightmare you had there , comrade . 
  that obviously never happened ^ never ^ happened ^ ^ never ^ ^ happened, 
  [ russian wildfires ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_russian_wildfires ), 
  the stamp is issued to celebrate tom of finland and his life achievements . 
  yes , his art is homoerotic , but the point is finland celebrating one of its most known artists . 
  quite fitting in my mind . 
  and if it really bothers someone , well , there 's still other stamps to pick . 
  the problem is that the elderly bigots vote more than young people , thus making our parliament more conservative than your average finn . 
  [ according to the latest polls 65 % of finns support same-sex marriage .

  just a few of my personal favourites : [ poets of the fall - temple of thought ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfvgvy7p1su ) best known for their songs in alan wake and max payne [ poets of the fall - cradled in love ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp0ahqoovsy ) [ chisu - sabotage ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw6bhzrd8 ) [ mariska & pahat sudet - kukkurukuu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzwnf9bhmze ) [ studio killers - jenny ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eguqju95vt8 ) okay , only 1/3 finnish but all european , 
  r\u00e4ndajad is beautiful !, 
  i was rooting for it back then , but good songs rarely win in esc ... as for why finns like rahutu tuhkatriinu , that 's because it 's cover of finnish song , [ levoton tuhkimo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjvietx4qzw ) ( enjoy the 80 's finnish teen heartthrob ! ), 
  plus eestikeelsed covers usually end up sounding so funny to us . 
  for some reason , estonian false friends often are really bawdy . 
  [ this being my favourite . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjm3_rcv6x4 ), 
  finland has pretty strong south/north and west/east divide in the terms of wealth , health , jobs etc. 
  most of the people live in the southern parts of the country . 
  that 's where the biggest cities are . 
  most young people ( especially women ) move there to study and work , and those who ca n't or wo n't are usually less educated . 
  so the problems accumulate to those northern and eastern areas . 
  this obviously is hyperbole , but it 's like the south and west gets all the educated young professionals , and the north and east are left with old alcoholic bachelors . 
  i 'm a bit baffled why finland is divided like that ... 
  i mean why are the northern and eastern parts lumped together like that ? 
  also why is that southern tip of italy so much darker ? 
  really ? 
  in spoken finnish usually everybody and everything are just ` it ' or * se * , except ( cute ) animals and babies , which are ` he/she ' * h\u00e4n * . 
  at least in my dialect . 
  but in correct standard finnish only people are ` he/she ' and animals and things are ` it ' .
