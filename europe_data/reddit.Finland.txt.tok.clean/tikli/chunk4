  for some odd reason i 'm starting to change my opinion about whaling ... and i feel unexplainable distrust towards danes ( * those damn foreigners !, 
  was it repressed during the union of sweden and norway ? 
  i honestly do n't know , and wikipedia did n't tell me much . 
  or perhaps a passive-agressive threesome knowing our countries , 
  yes , all true . 
  my problem was ( and is ) the presentation , and the false notions it brings with it . 
  if it had said  `` finnish is a uralic language closely related to estonian and more distantly to hungarian and some russian minority languages . '', 
  it would 've been fine . 
  or perhaps  `` finnish is part of finno-ugric language group , which includes such languages as estonian and hungarian . '', 
  fine . 
  but as it is ( and it 's often written like that ) it - in my opinion - gives out a wrong image of the relations of the languages in this language group ( similar to my indo-european example ) . 
  finnic languages ( i.e. 
  finnish , estonian , karelian etc. ), 
  are closely related to each other . 
  the other subdivisions are more or less distantly related . 
  in the 17th and 18th century , finland was simply finland , even in contemporary context . 
  * egentliga finland * or some other form was used instead if it was needed to use the old meaning of finland . 
  but like i said , i was nitpicking . 
  your counterfactual history speculation was fantastic !, 
  edit . 
  had to edit a bit , had a serious brainfart . 
  yeah , well i did n't say it was n't technically correct ( the best kind of correct !, 
  ) , but you 'd never see e.g. 
  swedish described as `` related to danish , some eastern european languages and , more distantly , persian . '', 
  yes , that 's exactly what i was thinking !, 
  upvote for the detail of your ` what-if ' scenario !, 
  ( my only minor nitpicking is about your use of term ' \u00d6sterland ' . 
  you probably used it to highlight the difference between this what-if-finland and real finland , but in reality it had already fallen out of use by the 16th century . ), 
  i do n't know . 
  i think the finnish national awakening would have still ocurred even if sweden never lost finland . 
  not perhaps in the extent it did , but still . 
  not to mention it 's hard to repress a minority if that minority is about 1/3 of the whole population . 
  i think if finland would still be part of sweden , that hypothetical present-day sweden would be officially bilingual nation , much like finland is now . 
   unlike their fellow-scandinavian neighbours to the west , the finns are not a germanic people but rather speak a language related to estonian , some languages of siberia and , more distantly , hungarian . 
  this is the second sentence of the overview of finland . 
  i like how hungarian is ` distantly related ' , but ` some languages of siberia ' are not . 
  and the fact that apparently we 're non-germanic people and scandinavians at the same time . 
  thank you for your answer , even if i strongly disagree with it . 
  i wonder if your opinion of fgm is tied to your own cultural background ( to the general american public of male genital mutilation , which has been - at least in the past - favourable ) . 
  i know mine certainly is . 
  i think this subject is one of the few where one can observe the so-called ` common european values ' at work . 
  that been said , i still think your notion that one type of mutilation would occur regardless is simply wrong . 
  education does wonders , even in this matter . 
  it 's no coincidence that most educated african women who have been mutilated as children speak against the practice . 
  after all , fgm is not religious practice ( at least not a required one ) , but a tradional one . 
  most of african fgms are done by village midwifes in unhygienic conditions . 
  even the fgms done by nurses in south-east asia have gone under a heavy criticism . 
   the trend towards medicalisation is also worrying because while it may reduce pain and struggling , it would also allow for a deeper or more severe excision -- as was being promoted in a village in south thailand by some missionaries from india . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.theislamicmonthly.com/a-tiny-cut-female-circumcision-in-south-east-asia/ ) as for the traditional/cultural values of the practise ... 
  i do n't believe in the sentimental value of a harming tradition . 
  the harm it does is not limited to the medical implications . 
  it helds back the whole society . 
   various reasons are offered for female circumcision , for example , to keep `` clean '' ; to `` purify the genitals and bestow gender identity '' ; to `` control women 's sexual urges '' ; because women can only be beautiful if chaste ; to help them not be `` as wild '' ; to make them `` more beautiful in the eyes of their husband '' ; or to make the latter `` more excited in bed . '' but i think we are both aware that neither of us is going to abandon our opinion , and i see little reason to continue this debate . 
  the very least we can do is to agree to disagree . 
  i did not actually know about this type iv mutilation . 
  but that does n't change my initial reaction to your comment . 
  i asked if * you * seriously thought it was * acceptable * . 
  it 's still the same harming practice of mutilating the female genital organs for non-medical reasons and usually done to children . 
  [ gishiri cutting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gishiri_cutting ) , for example , falls in this category . 
  i find it frankly just as disgusting as the other types of ritual genital mutilation ( including male genital mutilation ) . 
  am i understanding this right ? 
  your acceptance of female genital mutilation is based on whether it 's ` tiny knick ' or not ? 
  you do understand that even the ` tiny knick ' is removing the visible parts of clitoris and clitoral hood , thus often making the women completely unable to get any physical pleasure from sex ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:fgc_types.svg ) a picture if you do n't quite understand what exactly they are removing . 
  be that as may , most finns live in cities and towns ( 64 % ) and the capital region itself houses 1/5 of the whole population . 
  i think 13 % sounds plausiple enough considering all the facts .

  yeah , this is what i came here to comment . 
  i had no idea this was a pan-nordic custom  finland : always take off your shoes . 
  except when it 's a fancy party . 
  even then , most people ( or women at least ) bring their `` indoor shoes '' if it 's muddy or slushy outside . 
  she probably means all the rules . 
  finnish is considered very difficult language for an english-speaker to learn because it is so different . 
  but it has only few exceptions , unlike , say swedish , which has more exceptions than rules . 
  but swedish is still easier for her to learn because it 's so similar to english . 
  and it probably does n't help that we tend to switch to english if we hear someone struggle with our language . 
  it 's not that hard though , it 's just different . 
  yeah , the cultural norm of moving out when you 're 18-20 is so strong it makes you feel like you 're somehow failing in life if you still live with your parents in your early twenties . 
  i personally made the decision to stay at home a bit longer to raise money for my studies . 
  i was just 20 years old and working , and planning to start my studies following year , but it still felt really weird . 
  right ? 
  i was the last one of my friends to move out , and the last year or so felt really weird still living at my parent 's house even though they had plenty of room . 
  i was 21 when i moved out . 
  cultural ( and economical ) differences , i suppose . 
  i 'm from turku ( \u00c5bo ) from south-western coast of finland . 
  my local dialect is a laughing stock and the butt of jokes in the whole country . 
  for some reason it 's considered ugly and some finns even pretend it 's difficult to understand . 
  that 's complete bs of course , since standard finnish itself is an artificial compromise language based on both western and eastern dialects . 
  at first , the written finnish was based completely on turku ( or south-western ) dialect , and only in the 19th century it was modernized with some eastern finnish components . 
  so in a way modern finnish was a made up language no one originaly spoke , but every finn could understand . 
  that being said , my dialect is even more heavily influenced by swedish than standard finnish is ( and that 's a lot ) .
