i only wear [ karhu ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cf/fe/f2/cffef212f26c23208a8a98b6b367e343.jpg ) sneakers . 
  but i think the reason is the same - new balances classics ( cos tbh those are the only new balances i have noticed ) and karhus both have quite understated , retro feel to them . 
  they do n't look hideous with casual clothing like many sports shoes , but they are comfy and not too expensive .

  korhonen ( apparently somewhat of a mystery etymologically , * korho * might have meant deaf/stupid/chieftain / rich/something standing up but its uncertain . ), 
  virtanen ( * virta * means stream ) m\u00e4kinen ( * m\u00e4ki * means hill ) nieminen ( * niemi * means cape ) m\u00e4kel\u00e4 ( hill place ) the suffix - nen is an adjective ending . 
  most common surnames in finland are all some sort of nature or location based names . 
  my dad and his brothers built a cottage at the edge of a forest , near a small pond and a swamp . 
  there 's nothing else around for a few kilometres , so it 's nice and private . 
  except * ykssilim\u00e4ne * , the very tall one-eyed giant who lives in the forest . 
  he 's very quiet and stealthy , takes care of the lands and keeps ( his single ) eye out on people staying at the cottage . 
  he is not a bad guy , but he dislikes excessive noise , rubbish and small children who stray alone into his forest . 
  if you stay real quiet and stare a bit past of the forest , you might see something move from the corner of your eye , and that 's * ykssilim\u00e4ne * . 
  nope , regular old 0,33 l bottles . 
  ( they were beers from quite small breweries located in estonia , but still . ), 
  i usually pay something between 3-6 euros for a bottle , if i want to drink decent beer . 
  i 'm not sure if you can get any finnish beer in germany , or at least anything i 'd call decent , sorry . 
  my favourite finnish breweries are probably [ hiisi ] ( http://www.panimohiisi.fi/ ) and the finnish-estonian [ sori brewing ] ( http://soribrewing.com/ ) but i do n't know whether you can buy their stuff anywhere outside of this country . 
  i just spent 10 euros on two beers . 
   not even in a bar , but a store . 
  my parents had four ( wanted five ) . 
  i think i 'd be okay with just one . 
  i 'd like to visit texas !, 
  it seems like an interesting place with lots to see . 
  and i 've only met one texan ( a former professor at my uni ) but he was very nice , so i have high hopes for all texans .

  the newest is very nice as well . 
  there 's also [ the pub tram ] ( http://kohokohdat.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2013/05/olutratikka.jpg ) . 
  gardening is very popular . 
  most people on the countryside have at least a few blackcurrant or redcurrant bushes , some potatoes , carrots and peas etc. 
  in helsinki [ allotment gardens ] ( http://www.siirtolapuutarhaliitto.fi/siirtolapuutarhaliitto/the-federation-of-finnish-allotm/ ) are super sought after . 
  there 's also some free-to-use planting boxes in various public places . 
  and many people grow herbs , strawberries and tomatoes on ( glass covered ) balconies . 
  is n't `` fam '' london slang in origin ? 
  finnish r is very strong and pronounced on the tip of your tongue , so american r sounds very cute and impossibly soft . 
  i have no idea , really . 
  probably pretty weird . 
  english ( mainly american english ) sounded like * haabla haabla hablablabla * and a lot of really soft rrs . 
  preschool - age 6 1st to 6th grade ( * alakoulu * , elementary school ) - age 7-12 7th to 9th grade ( * yl\u00e4koulu * , junior high ) - age 13 - 15 after that you can choose * lukio * ( upper secondary/gymnasium ) or vocational school - age 16 to 18 or 19 . 
  these are not mandatory . 
  at the end of * lukio * you go through matriculation exam and take tests in at least four subjects . 
  one of them is always your mother tongue ( finnish , swedish or saami ) . 
  after * lukio * or vocational school you can continue to either university or university of applied sciences ( polytechnic ) . 
  it 's from [ this comic .

  interesting , i have n't thought about it before .

  students graduating from gymnasium get [ a black and white hat ] ( https://www.hattu.fi/images/product_images/frruyoiso.jpg ) . 
  if you become a * teekkari * , someone who studies at a technical university , you get a [ same type of hat with a tail ] ( https://lehti.tek.fi/sites/default/files/juho_salmi_lakit.png ) on your first year of studies . 
  we also have a tradition of [ student boilersuits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/student_boilersuit#/media/file:studentoverall.jpg ) , which you wear to uni-related parties and bar rounds during your studies . 
  when graduating , it 's just suits and dresses . 
  yep !, 
  get a good , solid canvas bag and you can load it to the brim with stuff without needing to worry it 'll break . 
  and the longhandled ones you can just sling on your shoulder , keeping your hands free . 
  yes , 0,20 $ . 
  i try to keep a cloth bag with me , much nicer to carry . 
  spokane , minneapolis and madison . 
  comprehensive school : 10 ( excellent ) 9 ( very good ) 8 ( good ) 7 ( satisfactory ) 6 ( fair ) 5 ( passable ) 4 ( fail ) university has grades from 1-5 , where 5 is excellent . 
  hey !, 
  i like the finnish name * suomi * more than finland . 
  finland is a bit boring name . 
  it 's a difficult book to start , i think !, 
  you have to endure the first hundred or so pages before pieces start to click together , but after that it 's a fantastic ride . 
  i 'm very sad about the possibility that there will never be a sequel .

  tykylevits is an artist from northern finland . 
  his [ lannistumaton ] ( https://youtu.be/wkyd-cdd_gs ) ( indomitable ) video is pretty classic . 
  ( he says `` men always give up . 
  i never give up '' ), 
  the country that tries its ' damnest to offer universal healthcare , free education and good public transport for all of it 's citizens . 
   equality is not a good thing there your thinking differs from a lot of europeans . 
  for me personally , how well country is doing is entirely dependent on how it 's doing as * whole * . 
  comparing how well you do if you are lucky enough to have a well paying job with great benefits and money to spare does not matter if people at the bottom are suffering . 
  flea market to me would be a place to sell your personal used goods ( clothing , toys etc. 
  ) , not produce . 
  those we have in several categories : * weekend flea markets . 
  in the summer outside at a market square , in the winter at hockey arena or other big hall . 
  you rent a table for a day . 
  * free-for-all flea market . 
  we have a big thing called [ siivousp\u00e4iv\u00e4 ] ( http://siivouspaiva.com/en/cleaningday ) ( cleaning day ) , a loosely organized festival when everyone in the city can join in and sell their stuff at streetsides , parks , at home etc. 
  it 's quite a lot of fun . 
  there 's also a lot of smaller park wide flea markets where someone just sets up a facebook page and people come to sell their stuff at some place . 
  * dedicated flea market shops . 
  you rent a table and a rack for a week or two , tag and price your stuff and set it up . 
  the shop staff keeps the place clean and sells the stuff . 
  you come back after the week or two , collect the money and the items that are still unsold . 
  [ \u00c5land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%85land_islands ) is part of finland but seems very distant from mainland . 
  they are autonomous and completely swedish speaking , and sort of feel like their own country . 
  here are a few : female : * ilona - ilo is joy , ilona would be `` as a joy [ to someone ] '' * vilja - grain/cereal grain * rauha - peace * aamu - morning * kaisla - reed * hilla - cloudberry * suvi - summer * ruusu - rose * orvokki - violet ( the plant ) * usva - mist male : * aarre - treasure * onni - happiness * toivo - hope * ukko - used as old man , meant the god of thunder or the supreme god * otso - bear * pyry - snow blizzard we have a lot of nature based names . 
  the positive adjective names were very popular after the war and gaining popularity right now as well , as sort of a ` retro ' name . 
  as a kid we had neighbour family of onni , toivo and rauha ( happiness , hope and peace ) . 
  mom is * \u00e4iti * or * mutsi * and dad is either * isk\u00e4 * or * faija * . 
  mutsi and faija are both helsinki slang , * is\u00e4 * and * \u00e4iti * are the correct terms for mom and dad . 
  siblings , aunts , uncles and cousins by first name . 
  grandma is * mummu * to me and granddad was referred to as * pappa * . 
  american mormon missionary tried to ambush me in a conversation while waiting a tram . 
  i was so flustered i somehow ended up pretending to be deaf . 
  not my highest point . 
  university students have a lot of parties/bar crawls/general happenings where you mix and mingle with students ' from other departments .
