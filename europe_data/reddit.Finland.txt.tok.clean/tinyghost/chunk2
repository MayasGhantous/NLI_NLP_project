  hobbies . 
  there 's a lot of events dedicated to a special interests with afterparties etc. 
  talking to strangers is not very usual , but not unacceptable either . 
  it 's fine to do so in a nightclub or a bar , if you also understand to leave someone alone if they do n't want to talk to you . 
  tinder and internet dating exist . 
  both are very popular way to meet new people . 
  ( that 's how i met my better half of 7 years and counting ... ), 
  currently probably [ to \u00d8l sur simcoe ] ( https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/to-ol-sur-simcoe/371543/ ) . 
  for the longest time i thought i did n't like beer , but then i found the sour stuff and realized that i just do n't like * some * beers . 
  personally i find it very odd how rigidly americans seem to be tied in the whole `` man has to pay '' thing . 
  well , helsinki has it 's own dialect called [ helsinki slang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_slang ) that differs from other finnish dialects radically because of its ' abundance of loan words . 
   helsinki slang first evolved in the late 19th century as a sociolect of the multilingual helsinki working class communities , where swedish and finnish speaking youth lived together with russian , german and various other language minorities . 
   -- it is characterized by a large number of words originally borrowed from swedish , german and russian , but nowadays chiefly english , vocabularies . 
  i 've lived in helsinki for 8 years now and i still occasionally struggle to understand the slang , especially if it 's spoken by older speakers . 
  the whole vocabulary is so different from ordinary finnish . 
  an example from the wiki article was : * `` can you fix that in a working condition ? 
  dress and a cardigan . 
  whatever sounds nicest in the closest uni cafeteria ( pasta/soup/salad / other + water ) or just some bread if i 'm working from home . 
  neverending mess in this apartment , my cat making noise at 5am . 
  busy , a bit worried , but happy . 
  probably haha as well . 
  going to sleep too late . 
  i do n't know why [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yrze9 ) makes me laugh everytime . 
  not to hot weather generally , but scotland in october was tough . 
  i 'm used to cold weather being sort of `` dry '' coldness , and glasgow was wet as hell on top of being cold and windy . 
  and the flat i was staying at was cold and wet as well , so it felt like i could never warm myself properly . 
  to my post code : pizza , nepalese , subway , d\u00f6ner kebab , sushi , szechuan chinese , unspecified chinese , brasilian food , middle eastern food , raw vegan food , pitas , burgers , mexican food , ramen , indian food , thai food , italian food , balinese food , georgian food , wings , donuts and ice cream . 
  we have two competing services ( wolt and foodora ) through which you can place an order to a variety of restaurants and they deliver it to you for a smallish fee . 
  pizza/kebab places also have their own delivery guys . 
  [ m\u00e4mmi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a4mmi ) , malted rye dessert commonly eaten on easter . 
  tastes a bit like dark bread or stout . 
  they are n't , they are super tasty . 
  but it 's a bit strange concept . 
  nope , we do n't do that . 
  we eat a lot of [ bland shit ] ( http://www.tuorepuoti.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/maksalaatikko.jpg ) , shit that [ looks like shit ] ( http://www.globeholidays.net/europe/finland/media/helsinki_mammi_5.jpg ) and [ blood pancakes ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fow7li_ctcu/uhblr9wqski/aaaaaaaabk0/-36i72xitye/s1600/veriletut.jpg ) . 
  there 's just a weird barrier in my brain when it comes to combining sugary things with bread . 
  yoghurt with jam for breakfast = fine , pancakes with jam for special dessert = all good , bread with jam = no no abort abort . 
  it does n't make any logical sense , i know . 
  i felt really dumb after that peanut butter moment . 
   fluffernutter aghh how is this even a thing, 
  finnish food is not really a hot commodity anywhere . 
  sweet sandwiches bother me , so pbj grosses me out as an idea . 
  i feel very strongly that sandwiches should be savoury thing only . 
  i was also slightly disappointed that peanut butter tasted just like peanuts . 
  i do n't know what i was expecting . 
  we have a [ place ] ( http://www.ravintolasoma.fi/en/#sushiburrito ) that does sushiburritos ... and ^ they ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ tasty ... you just have to forget the idea of sushi and just think of them as some sort of rice wrap with different fillings . 
  copypasted from my previous reply : we have an all-male conscription . 
  i do n't agree with it , but i think mandatory military service is a necessary evil in my country . 
  currently you can choose between conscription that lasts for 165 , 255 or 347 days or civilian service that lasts for 347 days . 
  i 'd make both options the same length and equal for both genders . 
  ostrobothnia also has the subcategory of very serious sober religious people , aka [ k\u00f6rtit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/awakening_\\ ( religious_movement \\ ) ) and [ laestadians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laestadianism ) . 
  i 've come to notice that as little there are of us , finnish people lurk * everywhere * . 
  every vacation i 've taken , there 's a moment when i nudge my boyfriend and murmur `` i bet those people are finnish '' and 99 % of the time they are . 
  last time this happened was in hong kong . 
  i did also get to listen some very ny american dude 's whole gangster family lore in a waiting line up to victoria peak . 
  i do n't know if he did n't realize a lot of people around him spoke english or if he just did n't care . 
  we have something called tet week ( * ty\u00f6el\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4n tutustuminen * = getting to know working life ) in 8th and 9th grades ( 14-15 years olds ) where students work in local companies for a week or two , unpaid . 
  the days are short , around 6 hours and the tasks are mainly just helping around , nothing very difficult . 
  a lot of kids do tet at their parents ' company . 
  it 's pretty easy and i do n't think anyone glocks down the hours you actually do . 
  i did mine in the local newspaper and library . 
  the library was great . 
  hilariously enough finnish alcohol monopoly alko organized a bidding competition to select an official liquor to celebrate our 100 years of indepence and liviko won with vana tallinn . 
  i mean , a lot of it probably gets imported here from silja tallink boats but still ... 
  beer and vodka , or [ viina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koskenkorva_viina ) , vodka-like clear spirit . 
  but our real specialty thing is [ lonkero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_drink ) , a long drink made of gin and grapefruit juice . 
  * mumindalen svenska * is the term i 've heard . 
  you do n't get to choose , but your opinion is apparently taken into some consideration . 
  i 'm of the gender that does not have conscription so i 'm pretty unfamiliar with the whole process . 
  we have an all-male conscription . 
  i do n't agree with it . 
  currently you can choose between conscription that lasts for 165 , 255 or 347 days or civilian service that lasts for 347 days . 
  i 'd make both options the same length and equal for both genders . 
  standard finnish was apparently purposefully mixed from different dialects , and has no specific region it 's from . 
  finnish also has somewhat separate * kirjakieli * ( book language , written finnish ) and * yleispuhekieli * ( common spoken language ) which makes everything a bit confusing if you 're learning the language . 
  well , they are more independently owned stores than supermarkets . 
  but there are quite a few asian markets , mainly chinese or indian , but they tend to cover several countries to some capacity . 
  i usually buy spices , noodles , frozen edamame and tofu there . 
  and gyoza shells . 
  edit . 
  also estonian stores !, 
  i buy mostly [ curd snacks ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=curd+snack&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewil7mjs5pnsahwhwywkhwhxbfcq_auibigb&amp;biw=1437&amp;bih=776 ) and [ must leib ] ( https://rameshwar.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/leib.jpg ) there . 
  we have [ this small place ] ( http://www.behnfords.fi/ ) , it mainly sells stupid expensive candy . 
   why make it when you can buy it ? 
  my mom would say : why buy something when you can make it ? 
  she grows strawberries , red currants , black currants and raspberries , and picks bilberries , cloudberries and lingonberries every year ( every man 's rights ftw ) . 
  she freezes some and makes some into jam and juice . 
  not doing that would be extremely wasteful in her opinion . 
  and it is !, 
  forests are full of stuff here , just go and pick it !, 
  no need to pay for it !, 
  bonus is that then you know exactly what 's in that jam - berries and sugar . 
  i prefer good cheese and breas as is , so cold . 
   it 's a bit of a waste to cook them , imho . 
  but if i do go for cooked , it 's usually [ croque-monsieur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croque-monsieur ) . 
  damn , i think i have like three or four uncle heinos . 
  yoghurt with kiwi and blueberry jam . 
  bread with cheese ( i could live of bread and cheese . ), 
  mashed potatoes , cucumber and meatballs with sauce . 
  i 'd probably recommend staying overnight but on the other hand , helsinki is much more expensive to stay than tallinn .
