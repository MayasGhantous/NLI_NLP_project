  if you 'd prefer staying the night at tallinn , at least [ tallink-silja ] ( https://www.tallinksilja.fi ) has a boat leaving around 7.30 am from tallinn and arriving in helsinki at 9.30 am , and a boat back leaving in the late evening . 
  that 'll give you a whole day of exploring . 
  trad stuff to do in the summer would be [ suomenlinna ] ( http://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/ ) , a fortress island . 
  it 's a cheap visit because there 's a [ public transport ferry ] ( http://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/visitor/how-to-get-there/hsl-ferry/ ) that costs 2,90 $ . 
  some museums inside the island cost money but it 's nice just to walk around and or have a picnic . 
  saunas are another trad thing , and there are plenty of public ones : [ l\u00f6yly ] ( http://www.loylyhelsinki.fi/en/front-page/ ) ( i think you can also swim there ? 
  ) , [ kulttuurisauna ] ( http://kulttuurisauna.fi/ ) , [ arlan sauna ] ( http://arlansauna.net/ ) and [ kotiharjun sauna ] ( http://www.kotiharjunsauna.fi/ ) , to name a few . 
  you might also want to check out / r/helsinki , there you can get more tips !, 
  light roasted filter coffee all day every day . 
  and i mean [ all day ] ( https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-what-the-world-drinks ) , we drink the most coffee per capita . 
  my parents have a cup or two of coffee 5 times a day and that 's pretty normal . 
  no tuition fees . 
  you get student grant of 80-250 $ , housing grant of around 200-400 $ ( depends greatly on your living circumstances if you get it ) and student loan of 400 $ ( raising to 650 $ next fall ) a month . 
  interests are very low , and if you graduate on time you get some of the loan written off . 
  most people also work in the summer and have a part-time job . 
  also easter bonfires at the best part of the country ( ostrobothnia ) . 
  americans probably do n't dip their chips in [ american dip ] ( http://www.chipsandcrisps.com/uploads/1/4/8/3/14831570/2428779_orig.png ) . 
  ( it does n't taste like burgers . ), 
  if someone told me they wanted to learn finnish , i 'd probably feel quite indifferent . 
  i do n't know why that would make me especially excited . 
  if i meet someone who has actually spent the time to do so , i applaud their efforts because it 's not an easy language to learn . 
  there 's a lot of forests . 
  this is what i have wondered as well !, 
  i 'm always happy when i get to remove shoes . 
  and how do you sit cross-legged on the couch or lift your feet up on any furniture or fabric covered surface with shoes on ? 
  these are apparently the top most popular names for dogs : 1 . 
  bella 2 . 
  rita 4 . 
  riku musti would be stereotypical name for a dog but apparently it 's only number 83 . on the popularity list . 
  for cats : 1 . 
  vili 4 . 
  leevi ( probably after calvin & hobbes , named lassi & leevi here ) 5 . 
  nelli i have a cat named gordon brown . 
  there 's around 15ish vietnamese restaurants in helsinki and probably all of them offer pho , so i 'd say it 's probably decently popular even if not quite everyday fare . 
  but that 's just helsinki and not the whole country . 
  not really , but `` muna '' means egg and is a common name for penis . 
  `` munat '' means eggs in plural and is a common name for a pair of testicles . 
  it 's very odd !, 
  there 's a lot of places named after swedish and russian people . 
  close by is brahen kentt\u00e4 ( brahe 's field ) named after swedish statesman per brahe the younger and leninin puisto ( lenin 's park ) named after ... well , you can probably guess . 
  our biggest shopping street in the helsinki centre is also named aleksanterinkatu after tsar alexander i. 
  the streets crossing aleksanterinkatu are named after his mother , brothers , and sisters . 
  there 's also a neighbourhood in helsinki called arabia , which also has street names taken from other places ( java road , paris street , congo street , syria street . . ) . 
  you can [ check it here ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/arabianranta,+00550+helsinki/@60.2061342,24.968909,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4692090ae9dac239:0x2600b5523c197891!8m2!3d60.2014453!4d24.966774 ) . 
  closest neighbours are pretty close , some 300 metres away , closest store and town centre is 8 kilometres . 
  finland is a little different from central europe in that people in the countryside tend to be more spread apart - not quite in the scale of the us but still so that it 's not uncommon to have no neighbours for a few kilometres at least . 
  for some reason we use identical quotation marks at the beginning and the end , [ as you can see from my example ] ( http://imgur.com/a/a1xop ) . 
  it 's very good !, 
  especially in iced coffee . 
  finnish . 
  this is just how i eat , not taking responsibility of describing typical finnish pantry .

  * coconut milk curry with tofu . 
  [ eevil st\u00f6\u00f6 - yksij\u00e4inen ] ( https://youtu.be/zhoseekp2cu ) i like it because the whole eevil st\u00f6\u00f6 character ( he always wears a balaclava and uses a voice manipulator ) and the whole story he has created around the character is very unique and well thought out . 
  it 's at the same time very tongue-in-cheek and sincere . 
  also the lyrics tend to be very interesting . 
  he was one of our [ eurovision hopefuls this year ] ( https://youtu.be/1kl1bq3gqgy ) !, 
  my first reaction was `` wait what , gunther still exists ? '', 
  tart , a bit sweet and juicy mainly , i 'd say . 
  it 's a difficult flavour to explain !, 
  some blog referred to it as `` sweet-sour apple flavour '' . 
  [ creamy salmon soup ] ( http://cookingtheglobe.com/finnish-salmon-soup-lohikeitto/ ) with some [ j\u00e4lkiuunileip\u00e4 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hww5wh0loak/vx_eebt3cui/aaaaaaaacw8/9khcsy6wus4/s1600/img_1760.jpg ) and for dessert some [ squeaky cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leip%c3%a4juusto ) with [ cloudberries ] ( https://d1vlhxry9oul9s.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6b701856ecc56322d0d577a5fb23a5ee-1.jpg ) . 
  we address all teachers/profs by first name or nickname and all the interaction tends to be pretty laidback . 
  women : [ maria guzenina ] ( http://static-sls.aws.sanomacloud.net/www.menaiset.fi/s3fs-public/styles/medium_main_image/public/main_media/1400062971_original_maria_g_2.jpg?itok=eq-czokz ) [ jaana pelkonen ] ( https://www.eduskunta.fi/fi/kansanedustajat/publishingimages/pelkonen_jaana_web_6803.jpg?renditionid=5&amp;width=128 ) [ nasima razmyar ] ( https://nasima.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2013/10/mg_8732.jpg ) [ satu taavitsainen ] ( http://www.lansi-savo.fi/sites/default/files/images/news_item/12837643-r.jpg ) [ susanna koski ] ( https://kirja.elisa.fi/sites/default/files/authors/susanna_koski_c_uzi_varon.jpg ) men : [ jani toivola ] ( https://tikkurilanlukio.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jani-toivola-kansi.jpg ) [ mikko k\u00e4rn\u00e4 ] ( http://www.lapinpuolustaja.fi/files/1714/2045/9243/mikko-pysty1.jpg ) [ antero vartia ] ( https://objects.fi-1.nebulacloud.fi/swift/v1/rhsitecontentimages/large/3d76acd7b9c6299ad20f2083ee9b0e1c.jpg ), 
  the last one is not used in a derogatory manner , mind you . 
  our government cut a lot of funding for universities , and they need to come up with something to generate more money . 
  some universities have had a lot of foreign students ( like mine , where all the master 's studies are in english ) but those numbers are now obviously going down . 
  university in finland is free for eu students . 
  since last year universities have started to collect fees from students coming outside of eu ( my uni costs 15k a year for non-eu master 's students now ) . 
  some people use `` h\u00e4n '' when talking about their pets . 
  that 's extra weird . 
  but occasionally we do use `` te '' ( plural you ) though . 
  i know i do when i try to be respectful towards old people ( 70 + ) i do n't know personally . 
  i love how old 70 's or 80 's volvos look like - they are immediately recognizable . 
  it might be the nostalgia talking though . 
  ours look very modest compared to norwegians !, 
  i love their flower patterns . 
  the longer version is `` voi vittujen kev\u00e4t ja kyrpien takatalvi '' which means `` oh the spring of cunts and the cold spell of cocks '' . 
  [ this is gordon . 
  * olla persaukinen * - have your ass wide open = be broke ( as in , have no money ) . 
  * heitt\u00e4\u00e4 lusikka nurkkaan * - to throw a spoon in the corner = to die . 
  * l\u00e4hte\u00e4 lapasesta * - to slip away from the woollen glove = to go out of control . 
  i did n't have that many expectations , but istanbul was a gorgeous city . 
  i really enjoyed all the layers of old and new together .
