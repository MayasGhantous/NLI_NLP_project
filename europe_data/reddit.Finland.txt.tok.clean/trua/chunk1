it 's not very common for swedes to emigrate from sweden to finland , but i suppose when they do , they continue to identify as ethnically swedish . 
  i 'd imagine they socialize quite a bit with the domestic finland-swedish population , but they probably do n't immerse themselves in that identity . 
  in fact , there are quite large dialect differences between the kinds of swedish spoken in sweden vs. finland , and most finns ( even those who do n't speak much swedish ) , can tell apart finland-swedish and swedish dialects and therefore also recent swedish immigrants from finland-swedes whose families have lived here for centuries . 
  `` finland-swedish '' people generally do not identify as ethnically swedish . 
  brits are crap with their tea . 
  oversteeped black sludge that nobody can drink without milk . 
  if you want good tea , go as far away from the uk as you can and get some quality chinese greens steeped appropriately . 
  yes , chinese is the latin of that area , i.e. 
  it has contributed loads of loan words to all the surrounding languages regardless of relatedness . 
   altaic [ uh , well , that 's very inconclusive . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altaic_languages ) mainstream linguistic concensus has not been reached on japanese ( or , more broadly japonic languages including dialects like okinawan ) being related to any other language groups . 
   obviously weather , but more specifically , the attitude towards it . 
  in november , people start saying stuff along the lines of `` i hope it stops being cloudy and the snow would come and brighten up things '' . 
  i personally am fine with the clouds , and would rather have them than below 0c weather !, 
  now that 's just crazy talk . 
  finnish elections use the [ d'hondt method ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) . 
  * ignore * is a word that is very very clunky to translate to finnish . 
  best attempts are usually something like ` to bypass ' or ` to not consider ' . 
  most languages of the world do n't have gendered pronouns in the indo-european sense . 
  most of the world does n't have particularly equal societies . 
  that article has been very widely criticised by a lot of linguists and should not be taken to mean much of anything . 
  * ei * does n't turn into a verb , it * is * a verb . 
  in finnish , when just saying `` no !, 
  '' , you use the singular 3rd person form of the negative verb : * ei * . 
  but the verb also conjugates for all other persons : * en ' i do n't ' * et ` you do n't ' * ei ` he/she/it / does n't ' * emme ` we do n't ' * ette ` you ( plural ) do n't ' * eiv\u00e4t ` they do n't ' it also has an imperative form : * \u00e4l\u00e4 , \u00e4lk\u00f6\u00f6n , \u00e4lk\u00e4\u00e4mme * etc. 
  in many other uralic languages , the negative verb also conjugates for past tense , but not in finnish . 
  i invite you all to / r/superbowl to experience wonders !, 
  the saami people of northern scandinavia and finland ( the grey area in op 's map ) also have a word . 
  it 's * juovlast\u00e1llu * in northern saami , probably something like * jyevl\u00e2st\u00e4\u00e4lu * in inari saami , and i assume other languages have their versions . 
  the [ st\u00e1llu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stallo ) is an old pre-christian folklore creature in saami culture , and today they just call santa claus `` yule st\u00e1llu '' . 
  yeah it 's more likely that estonian just did a fr  pr . 
  kind of like swedish franska ` french '  finnish ranska ` france ' ~ ranska ` french language ' . 
  what about fish ~ poisson ? 
  you ca n't see the relation to ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ? 
  prantsus was maybe borrowed before the germanic p  f change . 
  that was a really long time ago though , so not very likely . 
  it 's actually a loan from proto-finnic if i am not mistaken . 
  it 's just an exaggerated educated guess . 
  something like 70 % of all finnish words are loans from swedish . 
  yeah , but that was n't my point . 
  those facts about me are freely available regardless of us spying etc. 
  the things i do have to hide i do n't post on reddit !, 
  thus my call to the fine commenter who implied that concerns on said spying and use of reddit are incompatible . 
  wow , you can read . 
  want a cookie ? 
  i do n't use reddit for private communications . 
  what i post on reddit is comparable to writing opinion pieces to news papers . 
  it 's public communication . 
  nope . 
  * peruna * comes from old swedish * jordp\u00e4ron * ` earth pear ' . 
  compare with french * pomme de terre * ` potato ' , literally ` earth apple ' . 
  * peruna * is effectively the same word as * p\u00e4\u00e4ryn\u00e4 * ` pear ' , they were just borrowed at different stages of contact with swedish . 
  nothing to do with peru . 
  * kontio * is a loan from proto-saami ** kuom\u010de * , which is also the base for the modern northern saami * guov\u017ea * .

  same-sex marriage . 
  no that 's another word , it means `` pebbles caught in the compacted snow in the grooves of your shoe bottoms '' . 
  rightly so , i would say . 
  it is a pretty stupid and disgusting subreddit . 
  / r/dolan, 
  yohio ? 
  what ? 
  i do , and i 'm just a regular vegan . 
  not even any kind of activist . 
  it is because many finns moved to sweden in the 60 's to find jobd . 
  alcoholism is a common problem for first generation working class immigrants anywhere . 
  even the finlandsvenskar often think the rikssvenska dialects sound pretty fjolliga . 
  i 'm finnish , and i do n't drink alcohol or eat meat . 
  it 's hard to fit in sometimes :(, 
  i do n't see how this has anything to do with the alleged relatedness of the language families . 
  yeah , we all came from africa . 
  what 's your point ? 
  yeah , it 's a hypothesis that 's been around since the 1840 's but it has n't been sufficiently proven . 
  there has n't been enough evidence to reliably show that turkic and mongolic are related . 
  such a claim is not currently supported by mainstream linguistics . 
  what what ? 
  this map has `` altaic '' and nonchalantly groups turkic and mongolic together as if they are related ? 
  citation fucking needed . 
  i do n't think many people think of the name kustu as a form of the verb * kusta * ` to piss ' , but rather as a variant of kustaa < gustav . 
  i 'm not sure kosto is the same as ` revenge ' . 
  i have a hunch it might be ~ konsta < konstantinos . 
  some other purely finnish names : veli , sisko , rauha , heimo , voitto , aino , tellervo , jouko , p\u00e4ivi ... people also have lots of nature names like syksy ` autumn ' , suvi ` summer ' , pilvi ` cloud ' , pyry ` blizzard ' , terho ` acorn ' , tuuli ` wind ' ... 
  i do n't believe there are any attested r  t sound changes in the history of the finnish language , though . 
  and the generally accepted etymology for * otso * is that it is of uralic origin . 
  no loan contact from indo-european here . 
  there 's a whole bunch of these maps going on in / r/linguistics ( which is where this one is from as well , with fewer jpeg artifacts ) . 
   so , where would that word come from if not from the hands or/and nails ? 
  * suomen sanojen alkuper\u00e4 * only lists cognates in other finnic languages and mordvin . 
  the answer i am willing to accept is : we do n't know . 
  as is the case with many words . 
  wiktionary references uew , which i do n't have at hand , so i can not verify that source . 
  i also do n't feel like going to the library just to settle an internet argument . 
  so i guess we will have to leave this at a stalemate . 
   `` k\u00e4mmen '' ( hand ) has `` kynnet '' ( fingernails ) , so `` kahden k\u00e4mmenen kynnet '' will be '' ( the ) two hands fingernails '' . 
  this is ... it just does n't work like that . 
  words do n't just mush together like that , one vowel jumping over from one word to another . 
  `` former version '' is relative . 
  the language your mother speaks is , in a way , a `` former version '' of the language you speak . 
  it 's just like biology : where do you draw the line of when a species has evolved into another species ?
