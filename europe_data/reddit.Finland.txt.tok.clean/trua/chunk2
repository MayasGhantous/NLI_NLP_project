  also , icelandic is a bit of a weird example , because there is lots of willfull politically orchestrated conservatism within the language , as there is in french , for example . 
  i think icelandic used to be a little closer to norwegian , but they put back in some lost or almost-lost old norse features within the last few centuries to `` keep it real '' or something , 
  ah , well that 's a different thing . 
  you * can * sort of reasonably say icelandic is more * conservative * in certain respects than english , for example . 
  calling it `` older '' makes no sense though , because both languages and their proto-versions have been spoken for exactly as long since their common ancestor proto-germanic , for example . 
  effectively the same number of generations have passed . 
  okay , well , it does n't cite any sources for its wild claim that * kymmenen * is somehow derived from the word * k\u00e4mmen * . 
  the etymological dictionary * suomen sanojen alkuper\u00e4 * mentions nothing of this . 
  the leap \u00e4  y ( in an initial syllable ! ), 
  is quite extraordinary , and as such requires extraordinary historical-comparative evidence to support it . 
  the whole thing seems like a nice layperson 's conjecture , but the available linguistic literature has nothing on it , as far as i can tell . 
  however , the mention about the words * kahdeksan * ` eight ' and * yhdeks\u00e4n * ` nine ' originally being arithmetic notions of ` two removed from ten ' and ` one removed from ten ' has a little more merit . 
  some have speculated that the * - dek - * part in these words could be < indo-european ** de\u1e31m\u0325 * ( cf. 
  the aforementioned dictionary rejects this `` on phonological grounds '' , which makes sense . 
  after all , in this model the * - de - * part is explained by ** kakta  * kakte  * kahte  * kahde * , and similarly for * yhdeks\u00e4n * from ** \u00fckte * . 
  the remaining * - e-k-sa-n * is explained as `` fossilized '' proto-finnic morphology . 
  nope , * ei * is just ` not ' . 
  the differences are only based on word order . 
  * saying a language spoken today is older than another language also spoken today is a pretty nonsensical thing . 
  * yes , tolkien did receive some influences from finnis for one of his languages . 
  * no , * kymmenen * does not mean ` k\u00e4mmenet ' . 
  it has nothing to do with hands . 
  it just means ` ten ' . 
  the words look kind of similar , but there is no evidence to support a relationship . 
  estonian is easy to approach from a solid background in finnish , but i would say for someone starting out with no knowledge of either , estonian is probably harder to get going with . 
  this comment is so massively incorrect i am tempted to link it to / r/badlinguistics . 
  something i modified a little from my facebook feed ...  the very basics of finnish :   kes\u00e4 ei tule t\u00e4nne . 
  - summer is not coming here . 
  - it is not summer that will come here , but on the other hand something else , such as winter , might well be coming . 
  - summer will not come here because it 'll go somewhere else instead , like spain or tasmania maybe . 
  - summer 's not doing too well actually and therefore will not be doing any coming whatsoever . 
  - finnish proverb : the summer is not coming . 
  used to convey `` not gon na happen '' . 
  i drink tea . 
  absolutely hate coffee . 
  what 's wrong with being horny ? 
  there has been some preliminary work suggesting that milk may be linked with breast cancer . 
  also finland here . 
  best : no poisonous animals that want to kill me . 
  worst : this time of year i often miss * all * of daylight if i go to bed at 5 am and wake up 3 pm . 
  ( yeah i 'm not a responsible person with important stuff to do ... ) edit : a joke : `` finnish summer is short , but fortunately not very snowy . '', 
  i was thinking `` does this mean people in these countries read wikipedia in this language the most , or write it ? '', 
  it 's really hard to start learning your first foreign language at 14 . 
  it is way past the sensitive childhood language learning period . 
  you should start teaching foreign languages from first grade , while it 's still easy . 
  while that would please me , it would n't really feel right . 
  fallout sits so firmly on the imagery of 1950 's retrofuturism , mccarthyism and americana symbolism . 
  i do n't think that would be present in 22nd century finland . 
  if fallout assumes that the united states never left the cultural mood of the 1950 's , i think it 's safe to say that neither did finland . 
  so a fallout set in finland would just be an agrarian , developing country of translated schlager music , steam locomotives and walking on eggshells next to a communist superpower . 
  except laid to waste by nuclear war . 
  so it 'd just be unwashed hunting parties moving around on skis avoiding each other and radioactive hotspots of mutant bears . 
  with the occasional former farm village or mining town in between . 
  kinnunen is an adaptation of the swedish word `` skinnare '' . 
  i speak relatively fluent swedish and estonian . 
  i can read cyrillic , but i do n't really speak any russian ... 
  * riiuuy\u00f6aieuutinen * , bitch . 
  edit : these are only consecutive vowels in writing . 
  most people will pronounce it something like [ ` ri : ju : y\u00f8aije , \u0294 : u : tinen ] . 
  do n't worry , it 's not quite as simple as / u/didijustobama implied : - it changes to - k\u00f6 when applied to a word with [ front vowels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony#finnish ) . 
  - it is only used for questions that expect a yes/no answer . 
  yo , you have a typo . 
  the north s\u00e1mi is * l\u00e1vvardat * , with an r. 
   it implies all it takes to be a man or woman is clothes/wigs , etc. 
  in some ways that 's true . 
  gender is in large part also roleplay and theater , in addition to anatomical configuration , appearance , stature , voice and self-identification . 
  drag is an artform that highlights , celebrates , deconstructs and studies gender by placing exaggerated emphasis on the theatricalities of how people perform their own genders in everyday lives . 
  in this light , it 's perfectly fine to refer to the person as `` he '' but the character they play on stage and tv as `` she '' . 
  in fact , that 's exactly part of the show . 
  still , canada has more lakes than finland , even per km ^ 2 . 
  millions . 
  android is latin/greek for `` like a man '' . 
  also , northern saami ( davvis\u00e1megiella ) actually has a few dialects of its own that are not depicted . 
  not to mention finland-swedish as well has several dialects , some of which very distinct . 
  this map just lumps them all as \u00f6stsvenska . 
  my friend is a francophone and went to africa recently . 
  according to her , visas to burkina faso are issued by france . 
   se on hollantilaista sen kielioppi . 
  ftfy, 
  is n't that what you tried with the jews ? 
  eh , it gets a bit uncomfortable above 80 \u00b0 c if you ask me . 
  maybe there is in the greek language one . 
  but it 's full of dens . 
  we are finns , we need the finnmark , see ? 
  tea and cocoa is the shit . 
  i really wish someone would conduct some actual journalism for once and shed some light on who the traffickers are and how they operate . 
  a real , quality story in something like spiegel . 
  seems like his lens also had some pretty severe chromatic aberration . 
  even if the shots register properly in the middle , they are wildly mismatched at the edges . 
  currently trying to change it in finland . 
  in the early 90 's , services on the internet were distributed , open and implemented.by isp 's , universities and volunteers : email , usenet , irc , gopher directories , public ftp repositories etc. 
  now everything is a closed centralized commercial product . 
  in finnish there is n't a verb for snowing . 
  we just say `` it 's raining snow '' . 
  however there are some verbs for particularly heavy snowing : * pyrytt\u00e4\u00e4 * ` to snow a lot ' and * tuiskuttaa * ` to snow with added high wind or otherwise vigorously ' . 
  it looks like an orcish longhouse from warcraft or something . 
  the part that foreigners struggle with is how to stress the syllables . 
  the basic pattern is that the first syllable gets the primary stress every time and thereafter every other syllable gets a secondary stress , except never on the last . 
  however , in a compound word the first syllable of each constituent word breaks the pattern so that the secondary stresses land on the first syllable of each . 
  so it 's like [ ` kal.sa.ri , k\u00e6n.ni ] in stead of \\* [ ` kal.sa , ri.k\u00e6n.ni ] , where apostrophy marks primary , comma secondary and period no stress .
