  both want to be world imperiums in the end , which pretty much by definition makes both behave like fucks all the time . 
  i would n't give a shit about either , but i live in the buffer country , that is going to be the de facto battle ground when these two fucks go to war , since both are pussies and avoid fighting on their own ground and instead `` borrow '' other unrelated nations soil for their duke outs and proxy wars . 
  which means we get to deal with all the fall out and ruin left behind by said imperial armies should ww3 start . 
  problem is it is not up to you or any other driver when you have to react . 
  summer tires can make it , when you can plan ahead breaking zones etc. 
  problem arises when other driver makes sudden movement , forcing you to make sudden correction at which point you are pretty much done in for . 
  or a animal jumps on the road or million other ** unexpected ** things . 
  can you make it alone on empty road with summer tires . 
  yeah , if you are a good driver , know the road , take it slow and plan ahead . 
  you do n't have that luxury in real traffic , because it involves certain idiots called humans of whom large portion thinks they are rally experts . 
  what if the guy in front just decides to slam his studded winter extra specials on pure ice in front of you just after he passes you , due to you being so damn slow . 
  you will have 2,5 times braking distance according to tests compared to him . 
  you are going to rear end him . 
  no ifs or buts and you have no say when the car front of you slams brakes . 
  maybe they have to avoid animal or other obstacle . 
  problem is n't you have bad grip , but that you have horrendous grip compared to everyone else . 
  which means you are an agent of chaos in any sudden situation compared to winter rubber cars . 
  people think you will stop and react according to that assumption , but you suddenly wo n't stop . 
  no matter how much you smash the brake pedal , because you ca n't . 
  you are literally driving on hard pieces of plastic instead of gripping rubber . 
  all this while they stop and watch eyes wide at you sliding helplessly towards them . 
  yeah if nothing sudden happened ever . 
  of course nothing sudden happens ever , when the weather suddenly turns worse . 
  just because you technically can drive on ice and snow with hard plastic skates , does n't mean you should . 
  yep . 
  people do n't realize , that summer tires are meant for ** summer ** . 
  the compound starts freezing up already at 7 degree celsius . 
  by the time it hits 0 celsius they are pretty much hard plastic skates . 
  can you drive with hard plastic skates . 
  yes , but it is incredibly stupid . 
  the other problem is the `` all seasons '' , which are frankly criminal . 
  there should be law forbidding naming them `` all seasons '' , because they simply ca n't handle all seasons . 
  most clearly demonstrated by the fact , that they are n't certified as safe to drive for winter aka they do n't have snow flake markings . 
  those are 3 season tires meant to handle near zero temperatures and occasional snow and slush . 
  not to drive on packed snow and ice . 
  main difference is all seasons use summer compound usually , which means in deep winter they are frozen solid and useless . 
  there are couple `` all weathers '' from different manufacturers , but those are winter certified and are essentially summerized winter tires instead of being winterized summer tires . 
  gimmick and internal company reasons aka now they have a corporate sauna of their own for company internal use should they ever need it for some reason . 
  so they do n't need to rent someone else 's sauna & cabinet anymore . 
  in multiparty democracies compromise is a non avoidable fact of life in governing the country . 
   primaries and caucuses are public elections , which in turn determine who eventually wins the primary . 
  i myself voted in the new york primary . 
  public as in held in public , but not public as in governed under fec and election laws . 
  small difference in linguistics , huge difference in government construct . 
  meaning party rules , not laws decide what the winning conditions are . 
  note that at one point parties held no primaries at all and it would be fully legal for them to go back to that ( should party so choose internally . 
  note ** party ** , not public in general ) or for them to for example toss coin should the party commitees so decide on who wins election ( did n't they actually do that . ) . 
  which means they are n't open , neutral general elections . 
  as in anyone can vote for anyone from any party and except their vote to count `` equally '' regardless who they vote on . 
  where as in primaries the election rules from one party to another can be completely different , not to mention in some states and parties combinations primaries are only open to party members . 
  so one really really really ca n't call a party member only primary a public , neutral , fair and open ** general ** election first round . 
  even if it is public as in people openly vote in public in polling places . 
  a neutral general election first would look like exactly like current final general election , except for it to work usa would have to change election system so that all parties would have at least somewhat equal chance in the elections . 
  aka there would be really more than to people realistically in the running . 
  usually the purpose of first round is to see if anyone gets straight majority ( rare in multiparty democracy ) and if not have run-off between top two from * all parties * to ensure at least somewhat representative majority result . 
   democracy in the truest sense of the word . 
  see that is the sticking point . 
  just noting here nobody is correct or wrong , but different regions seem to have different meaning to the `` true sense of the word '' the thing is at least here where i live democracy and democratic are the same . 
  maybe it is switzerland 's influence , but one always specifies here should one separately mean direct democracy . 
  since europe has at least one at least traditionally direct democracy and then ton of representative democracies , it really does n't suit to assume which one is meaning just with democracy around here . 
  so democracy just means `` power from the people '' as an overall concept , however they want to manifest it . 
  of course in europe there is constitutional monarchs but for all practical purposes those are also representative democracies . 
  with ceremonial head of state monarch , while pm is the real equivalent of `` president '' as far as actual power goes . 
  so to me and anyone i know `` democracy '' means a nation with some form of democratic government . 
  so americans insisting on `` we are n't a democracy '' sounds really weird to us . 
  my first tough is `` so are you thinking of autoritarianism , being under a dictator or living in a theocracy ? '' . 
  because if one is n't a democracy , one is under someone else 's rule rather than common rule among people . 
   democratic - people vote on representatives and referendums yeah i think the difference here is democratic and democracy are pretty much synonyms or more like democratic + nation = democracy . 
  or even more widely democratic + governing = democracy . 
  and democratic taken to mean pretty much `` power comes fairly and equally from among people '' . 
  but yeah it 's really about what definitions everyone uses and frankly each of these ( constitutional , federal , democratic , democracy , representative , republic ) have multiple meanings varying small and big . 
  mostly because they are often defined by such things as nations deciding to include them in their founding documents to represent their specific setup and in national names ( or english translations there both off ) and since no nations system is usually exactly same it creates variation on the meaning . 
  and since it is in the local founding document / name people get really really antsy about the meanings and insisting on them being correct . 
  since again it matters for interpretation of their laws etc. 
  so the main problem is usa and europe have slighty different understood or even meanings for some pretty fundamental words involving governance . 
  of course meanings are always matters of agreement and what is commonly used , so nobody is really correct . 
  it just causes heck of a confusion and both sides should understand there is a difference on meaning and be as explicit as possible . 
  otherwise it will leads to such hilarity as * `` so how is your democracy doing usa ? '', 
  shouts european * `` we are n't a dirty democracy '' shouted back in answer by american ( meaning they do n't agree with absolute , direct , non constitutional democracy , aka tyranny of majority . 
  which by the way europeans do n't agree with either . 
  since just like usa all of europe has constitutions or equivalent documents with specific protections against tyranny of majority ) * `` so you like living in a dictatorship ? '', 
  will be the answer by european to american for sullying the honored principle of democracy ( meaning did you just call your nation a nation , which is not governed by it 's people but rather by some authoritarian groups , since that is what non democratic means to european ) . 
  * `` no we are a republic '' shouted back in insult for equivalenting usa with likes of north korea . 
  * `` so you are a democracy '' ( since for europe republic implies it 's parent group ' all the multitude of different kind of democracies ' . 
  * `` no we are n't , i just said that before . 
  do n't you remember '' ( do you have problems with short term memory european ? ), 
  * and round and round it goes . 
  seen this more than once . 
  all because if a linguistic difference in the meaning of the word `` democracy '' . 
  actually i would like to note myself falling to that trap in my previous message . 
   of course understand that democracy yeah as said , not so self-evident is it when one forgets matter of what `` democracy '' means depends on cultural context . 
  sorry for that . 
  though as said works in both ways , so :  it 's just using democracy to mean `` pure democracy '' rather than being pendantic about specifying that . 
  yeah actually in international context ( aka pretty much all of internet ) it is n't being pedantic , since different regions will interpret that short hand differently . 
  because politics is not about winning , it is about governing . 
  well usually actually nobody can `` win '' as in have 100 % of the power in the proportional system . 
  pretty much whole point of the system is that nobody gets all the power . 
  it nearly always leads to a coalition to have have a simply majority of representatives . 
  very very rarely would any single party get over 50 % of the seats and thus 90 % of the power ( excluding super majority issues like changing constitution etc. ), 
  so even the biggest party does n't really `` win '' fully , though they are talked about as the election winner .
