  mostly because traditionally the leader of the biggest party becomes pm , but he does n't really get to say and do anything he wants . 
  since him getting the coalition to go along with him in votes is dependent on him staying in the frame of the negotiated coalition agreement . 
  which usually always involves the `` winning '' party having to give concessions on many issues to coalition members to form the coalition . 
  just because parties are in government coalition does n't mean they mindlessly agree with the pm , on the other hand as long as pm stays within the negotiated parameters other coalition parties also make concessions and usually vote government coalition line . 
  two realistic choices , voting greens or liberals is always a principle vote despite knowing the voting system will waste that vote . 
  in many states it is 1 or 0 choice . 
  in deep `` red '' or `` blue '' state one might as well not vote at all , since the election result was clear before election and the election system in no ways registers whether the losing side lost by 1 vote or 15 million votes . 
  primaries are not public general elections . 
  they are party internal elections , ruled by party rules ( see super delegates ) . 
  only reason they are more public is because the two parties in some states choose to have them open to non party members . 
  do n't equate party primaries under party rules with general elections run under constitutional rules and election laws and federal election commission . 
  i know they are de facto first round , but it does n't make them good first round or equivalent to a two round presidential systems open general election first round . 
  not to mention there is two realistic choices ( to support candidate to win ) due to two party system and tactical voting . 
  greens etc. 
  participate in elections for publicity and their voters vote for their candidate despite knowing it is a wasted vote , rather they do it as a public statement or message rather than with intention of boosting their candidate to victory . 
  principle vote , essentially voting while staying at home at the same time . 
  only difference is vote to green gets registered as having voted , where as voting sleeping peoples party does n't show up in election results . 
  of which the first round is run on rules selected by a private biased organizations . 
  such funny rules as super delegates . 
  you have two realistic choices , counting all the 300 `` we are technically registered with fec '' candidates does n't make usa any less a two party system . 
  yeah usa had those long lists of names at the beginning , but then the minor parties and candidates learned the name of the game and dropped out or got eaten by the big parties . 
  most minor parties or groups just do n't bother , because they know it is waste of time . 
  got ta give hat of to libertarians and greens for stubbornness . 
  decades and decades of organizing and sticking , even though they know the election system is from the base rigged against them . 
  that is what one would call principled stance . 
  the large number of parties on the dutch list is a indicator that many small parties think there is at least some level of sense and meaningfulness in participating in elections . 
  it is a good sign . 
  that they think that there is even some chance that they get elected at some point . 
  the slim usa lists is not an indication that usa is politically more uniform , rather it is an alarming indicator that the election system does n't much work since many parties do n't see it meaningful to even show up in it . 
  13 parties in legislature is still a hella lot more than 2 parties in legislature ( + couple independents ) . 
  plus the point is in netherlands such thing as one of the major parties majorly screwing up and getting booted out of the top 2 or 3 lots is at least feasible . 
  screw up bad enough and the party will commit permanent political suicide in netherlands . 
  both usa main parties have been openly corrupt for decades and have n't been replaced . 
  at maximum one can boot one of the american duopoly parties to the number 2 slot for sometime . 
  which is why they are corrupt . 
  no matter how bad they are they are always at least number 2 and being even indefinite number 2 still gets politicians bills paid in usa . 
  aka democracy is european common speak . 
  understand democracy means democratic in europe . 
   the national government was ** never meant to be democratic ** as it 's chosen by states legislatures . 
   we 're not so much a democracy as a constitutional federalist ** democratic ** representative republic . 
  you just contradicted yourself . 
  you ca n't be democratic and not meant to be democratic at the same time . 
  either you are democratic or not . 
  meaning either power ultimately comes from the people or not . 
  of course understand that democracy involves multiple subsets of how specifically implement the principle of democratic government aka ultimate power lies with the population and government draws its legitimacy from the support of the population . 
  republic is a form of democratic government . 
  democratic representative government and republic are actually pretty much synonyms as far as european understanding of the words go . 
  for example my nation is officially the republic of finland . 
  which we consider a democracy . 
  meaning republic is a sub class of democracy and not a non-democracy . 
  non-democracy would be a dictatorship , theocracy , autocratic government , absolute monarchy etc. 
  yeah well we have public broadcaster here too . 
  people seem to forget the dynamic is public broadcaster keeps commercial medias commercial backers at bay and commercial media keeps public broadcasters political backers at bay . 
  have only either one of those and one is in for serious trouble . 
  have both and they keep each other somewhat honest . 
  best security is as many news outlets from as many backing groups as possible . 
  for latest hilarity from our public broadcaster : * http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/14401-yle-s-editors-in-chief-re-affirm-confidence-in-jaeaeskelaeinen.html * http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/yle_orders_external_report_on_companys_journalism/9475903 * http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38155965 * http://www.dw.com/en/two-finnish-journalists-resign-amid-row-with-prime-minister-over-press-freedom/a-36766091 * https://finlandpolitics.org/2016/12/22/frankfurter-allgemeine-juha-sipila-finlands-prime-minister-a-small-trump/ i guess one needs one of these scandals every now and then to remind people that no you do n't trust any one news source or even group of news sources with only a single backer . 
  special hilarity * http://www.finnishnews.fi/business-finance/one-more-senior-journalist-resigns-from-finlands-public-media-company/ she interviewved the editor in chief when this first came up . 
  her last question in interview was `` am i going to get fired now ? '', 
  answer `` we shall see about that later '' . 
  not couple months later she resigns moves to yellow press tabloid iltalehti ( literally evening paper ) for their internet-tv to host a oh so similar show she did on yle , but now called uncensored p\u00e4iv\u00e4rint\u00e4 . 
  so yeah yellow press keeping public broadcaster honest . 
  and why they demanded inter eu common defense policy and lisbon 42.7 . 
  see it does n't much help having nato security guarantees , if ones main threat is in nato . 
  you might want to read what he actually said , because what reads in headline is not what he said . 
  wowzer , would n't have tought bbc would steep down to that bad level of click bait headlines . 
  specially in such rather delicate issue . 
  well , ca n't trust anyone these days , can i ? 
  i thought that headline sounded way too simplistic for someone as eu speak trained as tusk to say . 
  and that ai n't a small shift . 
  at most it was directed at erdogan and his government , which is far far away from `` turks '' . 
  like i would have agreed with `` erdogan detached from reality '' as an analysis , but all turks ? 
  bbc are you trying to cause even bigger diplomatic incident here ? 
  this flame does n't need people fanning it . 
  it is a damn molotov of a situation to begin with . 
  well it is technically a simple majority , but i agree it 's still acting against the will of about half of the country on a hugely impactfull and long term issue . 
  the argument in my books is more that simple majority is not often good enough , even if it is the will of the majority . 
  ( edit : aka will of the people = / = will of the simple majority , frankly it depends on what exactly is being voted on and how and what is the rest of the governing setup . 
  ) there is a reason one does n't do stuff like constitutional changes on single simple majority vote . 
  i would equate joining/leaving a big treaty organization like eu on same category specially given the huge ground level political effects . 
  also in multiparty democracies , even if a crazy head wins the elections their win is not big enough to do anything they want alone independent of the rest of the parties . 
  problem is usa is very much a winner take all two party system . 
  so if crazy head wins elections they will have lot of power and can do pretty much on their own . 
  yeah i think the biggest trouble/hypocrisy raises , if one then tries to say `` but i had to , because law/culture/tradition '' . 
  nope , they did n't `` have to '' do anything . 
  as diplomats they are protected from forcing . 
  so that had to is really `` chose to '' and then one just has to admit a ) diplomatic reasons were more important than the principle or local political position b ) one really does n't full heartedly hold the principled position , rather it comes with '' * some conditions apply '' . 
  though frankly have n't followed close enough to know what each of these specific politicians stances are and what they claimed or commented on this . 
  this was rather a generic comment on such situations , which frankly do arise now and then with pretty high regularity . 
  diplomatic expediency / foreign relations many times drive over principles , but i would hope people would at least be honest about it when that happens and do n't try to come up with excuses . 
  just say `` we did it for diplomatic reason '' rather than some `` we try to respect x/y/z '' bs , if it is well known ones political position is exactly opposite to the thing being `` respected '' . 
  problem is some people take criticism , no matter how mild as insulting . 
  `` insulting '' is sometimes very much in the eye of the beholder . 
  frankly some times it is pretty much literally impossible to criticize some ideology ( no matter how rational , valid , widely agreed , facts based etc. 
  said criticism is ) without said ideology 's ( be it political , religious or philosophical etc. ), 
  followers taking said criticism of the ideology as personal insult . 
  at that point there is not difference between insulting and criticism . 
  of course one should n't intentionally insult someone , just for the sake of insulting . 
  but sometimes one just knows one ca n't avoid the insult , because other side will get insulted no matter how smoothly one is trying to get ones argument or point of view across . 
  at that point it is a choice between insult someone or having no meaningfull communication at all .
