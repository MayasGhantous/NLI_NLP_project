  essentially any such official diplomatic mission is under pretty much de facto diplomatic immunity to such things . 
  the options for receiving country are pretty much refuse the meeting and tell the other side to go home or tolerate them . 
  one ca n't exactly throw any foreign government officials like mps or ministers on an official government visit to jail . 
  if they travel there as private persons , sure it would apply . 
  as part of diplomatic delegation , they are pretty much de facto diplomatic immune , even if not technically officially so as accredited diplomat . 
  of course there calculation here is , which side needs wich more or which side wants to make the negotiations smooth . 
  for example technically they might not need to or want to wear hijab , but the diplomatic calculation was that having iranians on good mood was more important than their principles on this matter . 
  or they do n't mind or really have that strong principles on it . 
  of course there is the political calculation , which now bites them . 
  bending apparent principle matters for diplomatic reasons , makes one 's home turf think how stead fast those principles really are . 
  yeah . 
  it is tragically funny frankly . 
  like first an foremost that is that bad negotiating on european countries . 
  essentially willingly making themselves officially dependent of usa ( which gives huge diplomatic leverage to usa ) , when eu members easily as combined entity is enough to guarantee eu 's safety . 
  yeah . 
  like say declare that lisbon 42.7 means what it means and it will hold . 
  frankly eu does n't need usa . 
  even the current european forces could easily repel an russian attack ( which is highly unlike ) . 
  just make it clear russia has to fight whole eu , if they start messing around in eu territory and they wo n't attack . 
  it anyway makes more sense to have closer intra europe defense co-operation , rather than eu usa co-operation . 
  purely on geographic grounds . 
  as certain ww showed , europe can be bombed to pile of rubble and it does n't affect american daily life . 
  however it does affect rest of europe directly . 
  so it makes sense to do common european defense , than intra-atlantic defense , since other european nations have vested interest to not only have enough strength to win a defense , but to prevent attack in first place . 
  since be the war in anywhere in europe , it will affect rest of europe . 
  like say new old plan lisbon 42.7 . 
  ai n't people happy now greece demanded that written in in case turkey attacks . 
  handy to have multiple security co-operation organizations . 
  avoids the all eggs in one basket problem . 
  pensioners in general . 
  from all over europe . 
  moving to spain for old days ( atleast part time ) is a very well known thing here in finland . 
  probably true for most northern eu countries also . 
  sun and warmth nothing more to it really ( + spain is common vacation spot to begin with among finns so it 's familiar . 
  problem is counter propaganda is still propaganda and now a days people seem to have short tolerance for propaganda from any side or anykind . 
  like my first question was `` is russia trying to get le pen elected '' or `` is dgse trying to get le pen not elected '' . 
  dgse is also an intelligence agency and frankly at the moment my trust for intelligence agencies from anyside , including my own , is negative million . 
  just like russia can do disinformation warfare , so can france and dgse . 
  of course it would be way more gross violation of principles , if dgse intentionally tried to affect their own nations election result . 
  of course it is also possible dgse is being honest , but as said i trust no one be it americans , russians , french or finns as it comes to intelligence agencies . 
  those agencies have got their hand caught in the political cookie jar couple times too many to be trusted . 
  pretty sure we finns would prefer accepting organized refugee quota , than uncontrolled refugee overflow from russia , sweden and norway . 
  i was a bit of a shit show in tornio , when the flood began . 
  as in call army to help organize emergency tent housing etc. 
  levels of chaos . 
  far easier to organize refugee handling when one would at least get like a weeks forewarning on the amounts involved . 
  do we like massive flood of refugees , no , but if it is to happen , let it be damn organized flood at least . 
  pretty sure most of finland and finnish politicians here are practical and down to earth enough to know , there is no stopping this flood . 
  this involves forces literally beyond control even whole of eu ( like multiple wars not involving eu ) or even human kind ( like climate patterns shifting ) . 
  is it controversial . 
  absolutely , any issue of this scale is . 
  beyond rational talk ? 
  maybe for true finns , but mostly all the other groups and the government `` machine '' is concerned with far more practical and day to day issues , like how to feed and house the refugees . 
  since we ca n't exactly leave them in -20 c freeze in a tent village . 
  did anybody like when the refugee flood started ? 
  no , but at least in finland i think the reality of the situations absolute inevitability has set in and mostly the question is now practical handling of the situation with minimum chaos and disturbance to the operation finland ( been running for almost a century now . ) . 
  and no random anybody just walking , flying etc. 
  to the country and saying `` i want to move to finland '' wo n't get finnish ubi automatically ( since they just do n't get to automatically move in with residency to finland ) , so no we are n't exactly concerned about that . 
  more we are conserved with what the born and bred humans inside do with that ubi . 
  hence why there is ** experiment ** running . 
  no but the overall touch might be little more patient . 
  this is a good tactic . 
  it shows people care about the police . 
  if people care about police , police care about people . 
  if police care about people , people care about police . 
  it is a mutual symbiotic relationship . 
  neither can get respect from the other without given it back . 
  gesture like this is n't about what happened last night or what happens next night . 
  doing this kind of gesture will in general build a good relation between groups . 
  people must understand police has job to do and police has to understand people walking on protest are there for a reason , so they wo n't just disappear conveniently when told to , because being inconvinient is one major way protests work . 
  the solution is to make sure public education is not shit at teaching critical thinking . 
  so the solution is not less education , but more and better education . 
  i in no way implied the current situation is a good and sustainable situation in this regard . 
  mostly the problem is ... ahem ... some democracies politicians are reluctant to put resources in critical thinking education , because for it to work against manipulation by outsiders , there ca n't be off switch . 
  which means once you turn on that critical thinking effort , also their own political manipulations and machinations get spotted by the new more critical population . 
  frankly people should realize in a democracy the vulnerability of the whole general population to political and ideological manipulation is a matter of ** national security ** . 
  just like nation needs military armor and defense against military threats , it needs mental , political and ideological defense against manipulation and foreign nefarious influencing . 
  in case of democracy that means armoring every citizen against being conned by foreign agitators and manipulators . 
  only problem is that armoring works against domestic threats also . 
   so is nato still necessary ? 
  for eu ? 
  technically not . 
  practically yes for sometime , since the necessary practical work to make 42.7 credible deterrent is just starting aka closer ** eu ** lead defense co-operation and coordination in europe . 
  essentially eu is taking step to make sure nato is redundant and not necessary in future for european common defense , incase nato in future fails eu . 
  eu is very much about common shared redundancies for unlikely events , which eu members have no resources to do alone . 
  case in point galileo , which was solely done as a redundancy move for gps . 
  europe was 99 % sure they could trust usa on gps availability , but to get that last 1 % of certainty in case of extremely unlikely scenario eu spent billions of euros . 
  just in case . 
  ( plus to support european space industry and technology development ) . 
  just like 42.7 it is one of those `` just in case '' things of eu . 
  actually written initially mostly on the pressuring greece , because nato member greece , feared nato member turkey would attack it . 
  reason , see cyprus . 
  since nato does n't involve itself with internato wars , greece wanted secures from rest of eu , that should greece get attacked by turkey , rest of the european nato members would n't just sit idly by ,, 
  treaty of lisbon is an eu treaty and 42.7 is one of it 's articles . 
  for simplicity here is what it says :  mutual defence clause ( article 42.7 teu )  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specificcharacter of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
   commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the north atlantic treaty organisation , which , for those states which are members of it , remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation . 
  finland could n't exactly expect nato to honor it 's military alliance with finland , since there is no official alliance between nato and finland . 
  nato has zero legal obligation towards finland , unlike eu and it 's members . 
  those have obligation to aid finland in defense in case finland is attacked .
