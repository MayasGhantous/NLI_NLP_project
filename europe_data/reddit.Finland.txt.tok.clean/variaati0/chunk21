  three options . 
  option a : education option b : education option c : education, 
  there is this thing called education and critical thinking . 
  first can be applied to enhance the second . 
  frankly that is the only way to combat manipulative power . 
  to have well educated enough general population , so that they spot the attempt of manipulation on their own and take corrective measures . 
  one more reason why general ** public ** education is so important . 
  it does n't matter , if the top 10 % is super educated , if the rest 90 % are so badly educated they can be duped even by the most amateurish of con men . 
  apparently you forget eu already is a military alliance . 
  or did someone take eraser to lisbon 42.7 . 
  i at least as a fin fully expect rest of eu to honor our ** military alliance ** in support of our common defense in the case of finland coming under attack . 
  regardless if the attacker toward finland is usa or russia . 
  and also that even the referendum ca n't overrule/bypass them , since technically the referendum has no legal power to make a new law . 
  which is the real world counter to the `` but we already voted on this in refedendum , so why parliament needs to vote . 
  referendum is even more democratic than parliament '' argument . 
  problem is there is n't a law place in uk saying `` if referendum decides something , it immediately becomes a law '' . 
  only way to make laws ( which has whole process to it , rather than just mps deciding in 5 minutes to vote on a decision ) is through parliament . 
  so even if pm would not be pushing for it , but referendum people would be , it still would take a parliamentary legislative process . 
  because referendums do n't make laws , parliament does . 
  unless there was a law setup ** before ** the referendum happened to essentially say `` here is the new law text , this named specific referendum decides whether or not this specific law comes to effect on this specific date '' . 
  so parliament could make a law , but then relegate it coming to effect to a referendum ( should parliament wished to and specifically did it before hand ) . 
  but referendum deciding on a principle or even specific action , does n't mean a matching law suddenly appear in the law book , if said action requires a law to be actionable . 
  first of all , what would be the specific text , if this was n't prepared . 
  `` leave eu '' is not a bureaucratically or legally actionable law for the ministries and diplomats to follow , law need to specify `` how '' to a minimum actionable degree and not only `` what '' . 
  not to mention here would be a huge political scheming over the specific text , if it was n't prepared before the referendum . 
  like for example in this specific case there is n't probably even decision and consensus on a specific law text ready even to date for this new required law to remove the old laws and leave eu and referendum was ages ago . 
  it wo n't be a simple `` lets leave eu , start article 50 '' . 
  rather it will be '' following statutes related to uk joining eu ( dont really know how uk refers to specific law parts ) 1965 , 1991xyz , 1975bbc are thus ordered to be removed as laws , also decided that uk will leave eu lissabon , maastrich , helsinki , oslo etc. 
  treaties . 
  as stated by these treaties the article 50 proceeding must take place for uk to leave these treaties as agreed to by uk , when joining these treaties . 
  thus government is ordered to initiate article 50 with eu in accordance with treaties . 
  etc etc etc. 
  tons and tons more technical necessary nitpicky stuff and necessary legalese '' . 
  just all this listing out of the relevant effected laws , statutes and treaties takes some amount of preparation . 
  leaving such huge and complex set of interlocking treaties ( the legal manifestation of uk being member of eu ) is a huge technical and bureaucratic under taking . 
  so not only will there be vote , but before there will be rounds and rounds of law preparation ( probably even political haggling over the specific language of the leaving laws , like there always is ) , committees and then a vote . 
  not on leaving eu , but on the specific laws setting up this process . 
  or in other words ( if i understand correctly ) uk made laws to join eu and uk government ca n't make or brake laws . 
  only parliament has that power . 
  so to leave eu , aka break the laws that agreed to join uk to eu , parliament must make a new law saying `` those laws that joined us to eu are null and void and we order pm to start article 50 process '' . 
  since the legislating power is with and only with the parliament nobody , not pm , not queen or even full national referendum with majority support can bypass parliament on this , due to how uk technical and legal division of powers is set up . 
  well mostly the hospital is saying they ca n't say for sure the reason was only the damage from the kick and fall . 
  pretty much everyone seem to agree kick was one of the major causes ( due to it being the cause of the initial head injury ) . 
  however since they ca n't say for sure it was only the kick and not also the drugs and not staying in treatment , he got convicted for assault and not for killing . 
  its not like the kick had nothing to do with the death . 
  it absolutely had . 
  however there was other factors also ( in the view of the court ) , so he was n't convicted for the death . 
  my point was it could be reintroduced in the next satellite generation , hence the decades scale . 
  not probable to happen , but one does n't decide these decisions on `` it will probably be okay a decade from now '' grounds . 
  such unicorn as nokia n9 . 
  but it could be reintroduced . 
  understand these projects work on scales of decades . 
  pure and simple eu decided location services were too critical to be trusted to anyone outside ( including usa ) and to be purely in military hands . 
  not to mention the redundancy benefit of having two `` friendly '' independent navigation systems . 
  also known as critical infrastructure planning is all about spending enormous amounts of money to avoid even the most unlike situationa , but when that one time happens one is really really happy one spend the money before hand . 
  eu deemed navigation as critical infrastructure , after that the money spent is pretty much non issue . 
  it could have costed double the current price and the project would have went through . 
  edit : same as whole ariane launcher program . 
  it will be kept going regardless of cost , because independent launch capability is deemed critically important . 
  frankly more thing of principle . 
  been following the project since like 2006 . 
  so might just upgrade for the sake of having it , even though the constellation is not complete . 
  it 's not like any of my uses anyway needed better accuracy than now . 
  more i 'm interested in the better northern latitude coverage , given my location here in winter wonderland up north . 
  sometimes it gets tricky getting even 4 gps birds in view . 
  not to mention even after the constellation is complete the optimal solution is to combine as many constellations as possible.more reliability , redundancy , better coverage and accuracy . 
  edit : plus my phone is old and non supported ( nokia meego and all that jazz , so highly doubt full it plays galileo , even if the chipset supported it ), 
  finally . 
  now if only my phone supported it . 
  to upgrade or to not to upgrade , that is the question . 
  nope homes are well insulated and heated . 
  you know we have this thing called technology here . 
  we use it . 
  i live in finland . 
  drowning is clear and present danger every summer in the country of thousands and thousands of lakes . 
  that is if one ca n't swim . 
  if one can swim , it is not a danger for the most part . 
  i think that is part of the lesson of mixed pe like swimming . 
  at least in germany , one just is going to see say swimming women in swimsuit or different bodied people etc. 
  so rather than trying to hide it , or the fact that teens have ** gasp ** hormones running around in their head , lets just get it over with safely and teach peole to how to deal with it in acceptable ways . 
  part of mixed gender education is they idea of getting the genders to be able interact with each other without it devolving to and orgy or someone getting attacked . 
  is there going to be staring , jkoking , banter and horsying around ? 
  yes and that is part of the lesson , because when it starts to go too far teacher is there to intervene and thus everyone learns the levels of do 's and dont ' s without any major damage happening . 
  is it little uncomfortable to some ? 
  yes , but frankly that is also part of the lesson . 
  part of the job of school is to take one out of ones mental comfort zone and learn how to deal with it , because it is inevitable in ones life later on . 
  again with professional around to make sure this is done in safe and controlled fashion . 
  no it is n't , because real world includes religious people . 
  people one has to communicate , coexist and do business with . 
  so class like world religions is extremely useful to know and understand different groups thinking ( whether one thinks they are right of wrong is a separate matter ) and culture and thus know how to best approach communicating with them . 
  understanding them and learning about does n't mean automatically agreeing with them . 
  sometimes it is exact opposite . 
  understanding their thinking and principles makes formulating counter arguments and disagreements more effective . 
  heck some of the most well read people of religious texts are actually atheists , since they have had to go through bible , koran , torah , nordic sagas , buddhists texts , hindu texts , l ron hubbard books on scientology etc. 
  to be able to argue their disagreements and counter arguments with a religious person based on their specific religion , no matter which religion it is ,, 
  not many children enjoy maths either or grammar or many other things like home work . 
  school makes one do lost of stuff one rather would n't do because knowing those skills is useful for the person . 
  knowing how to swim is literally a life or death skill for many people at some point in their life . 
  so school forcing people to know how to save oneself , if one happens to fall into water is a rather good thing i think . 
  frankly that is the least interesting thing in the whole affair .
