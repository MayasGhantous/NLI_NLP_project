  they have to be active and beneficial on local level . 
  essentially this is case of `` humans being too good at their job '' . 
  unions were and are protection against unemployment , bad terms etc. 
  the thing is in finland these things are being wwoven to the base structure of society , so separate big guard dog is not so relevant any more . 
  which means there is lot of barking in the kennel due to them losing ** their ** guard dog jobs . 
  should it be necessary guard dogs can be rehired as need basis , but there is not need for permanent position . 
  riot shields . 
  you can see pair arriving with one . 
  yes and actually he probably saw the planned detaining team arrive . 
  in the end you can see a patrol pair with riot shield at ready arrive . 
  the rest of the officers put their guns and batons away and create a large ring around the person . 
  this is n't ** random ** . 
  this is clearly a planned and trained procedure . 
  the first officers to arrive probably took out guns and batons to control and contain the situation initially . 
  they also called in reinforcements , since they have no intention to end the situation by themselves unless absolutely necessary ( aka the guy ca n't be contained or is about to harm someone ) . 
  reinforcements probably got told `` it 's a knife wielder '' . 
  which kicks in training . 
  okay , knife armed guy , best eguipment : riot shield . 
  so patrols get riot shields , if they have them . 
  rest see riot shielded guys arrive : cavalry is here . 
  so no need for guns anymore , since that riot shield is way more effective on the situation and guns probably just needlesly agitate the target . 
  main group forms a containing zone aka the ring : keeping the guy inside and showing all by standers , stay outside . 
  riot shielded team is about to enter the containment ( you see coming in ) . 
  however this is where the `` curve ball '' happens , but in a good way . 
  one of the officers clearly goes `` shit i do n't have a shield . 
  is there something i can use as shield '' , so plastic road block it is . 
  then he probably just goes , well one could use this as blunt instrument and does so . 
  subduing the offender . 
  when he is down , officers charge in to secure the knife and offenders hands among them is the detaining pair with their shield . 
  it 's pretty text book de-escalation ( minus the in promptu road block ) . 
  isolate the target to separate him and public , maintain said barrier , use only absolute necessary force and lower the level as soon as possible to calm the target ( put away gus and batons , when enough numbers present to handle situation otherwise ) , start using planned lowest force detaining ( bring in shield , since that is the best agains knife ) . 
  subdue the offender with physical force ( plan was probably that shield , but hey road block works also ) . 
  all the time probably one of the officers is talking to target and saying , `` put down the knife , put down the knife , could you please put down the knife so we can talk etc. '', 
  this is the reason police in europe in many places do n't use so much guns ( even though most countries officer have them ) . 
  they are trained to handle the situation in a safe manner without using the gun and eguipped as thus ( pretty sure probably nearly every patrol car contains a riot shield , exactly for situation like this . ) . 
  if they would have to , they would use a gun . 
  make no mistake about that , but they do n't have to due to being trained and experienced in handling the situation with other means . 
   another member of the nato would be a completely different animal . 
  you might want to read that member list again . 
  your search for word `` finland '' might be less than fruitfull  in any extent , it would not demand some change in the geopolitic landscapd , it would require a complete re-evaluation of the current world equilibrium . 
  did n't i preface that with `` prepare for the unexpected '' . 
  complete flip of world equilibrium is extremely unlikely , but small country like finland sitting in an block border has to prepare for that kind of stuff , atleast on a plan of action level . 
  `` if world equilibrium flip , what we gon na do ? '' . 
  one better have answer for that in case that one in trillion chance hits , because it will have vast consequences . 
  that is what people like government emergency and military planners get paid for . 
  thinking and planning the unthinkable . 
  so that one is n't paralyzed , when unthinkable happens . 
   if those american spec ops act without any distinctive mark on their uniform , they 'd be illegal on more than one count and not only regarding finish law . 
  that or being `` unamerican '' has n't stopped cia before . 
  because usually it has been cia running these militia ops , due to not falling under military code . 
  which is again why this law is handy . 
  it does n't require enemy to be official foreign military just acting without insignia . 
  it counts in any weird contractors , intelligence agencies etc. 
  by saying it is not important what they are , rather how they behave and act . 
  if they behave like foreign backed military unit , they are foreign backed military unit . 
  regardless of being to exactly identify who or what they are or what they actually are or if they actually are formally part of a foreign military . 
  they resist , they get shot . 
  that is kinda the point of the law . 
  it makes the activity illegal ( thus arresting ) , but also classifies it as military action ( thus authorizing use of military force against it ) . 
  which means any resistance etc. 
  is grounds for lethal force . 
  aka if they are n't laying down the guns , waving white flag and surrendering they get shot . 
  probably with a leo2a4 tank cannon . 
  unlike if they were say normal criminals at which point police force rules would apply , which would mean going as far as practically possible without endangering officers and public to keep the persons alive . 
  the thing is this is tightly tied to the new defence forces readiness units , that have just gone on watch duty . 
  this law was made so that those quick reaction readiness units have authority to use military equioment and force against any incursions by enemy spec ops not wearing military insignia ( as spec ops often do ) . 
  so now , if said militia appears , within hours a platoon of tanks and company of quick reaction force soldiers as well as probably aerial support will be bearing down on the militia . 
  without having to go to parliament or government for authorization ( which would negate the whole point of the readiness units , which is to be able to react with the full spectrum of military firepower within hours , instead of authorizing it for couple days . 
  at which point normal military unit would be mobilized anyway , but the enemy militia might have created an entrenched beach head for further operations by that time . ), 
  well it applies to anyone . 
  be it russian or chinese or american or swedish or australian special forces entering finland as unmarked militia , kitted out and without permission . 
  of course russia is the most probable ( and most probable here counting as highly highly unprobable ) culprit . 
  however one should always prepare for the unexpected also . 
  should say usa due to some change in geopolitical landscape find some reason to think `` delivering freedom '' to finland would be in their highest interests , they would not be any less `` illegal unidentified militia '' , if they sent spec ops forces to finland without acknowledgement . 
  would not be the first time usa run a clandestine war . 
  ww3 breaks out , it does n't matter who started it . 
  finland will be the scorched earth battleground for both sides due to geography . 
  it is a crime . 
  they wo n't be dispersed , they will be arrested . 
  but she knew as soon as she lifted it to conscience vote , legislature overall would have votes to pass it . 
  politician her caliber does n't do stuff like this randomly . 
  she full well knew as soon as she realized her party from party line vote , it would be only matter of how fast vote on this could be arranged . 
  more like merkel took time . 
  only thing preventing this for last couple years has been merkel personally being against it and using her position as chancelor to keep her party against it . 
  it went through as soon as merkel lifted the party whip on this issue and said her party members can vote conscience . 
  no they ca n't , when they are in commanding marketshare position . 
  such is the law . 
  apple is not in monopoly marketshare numbers . 
  you get to commanding marketshare position , more strict rules start to apply . 
  russia would never give up crimea , even if crimeans wanted to . 
  one word : sevastopol . 
  variable rail width rail car buggies are a thing . 
  the other proposal is the ( imho vapoware ) hyperloop tunnel . 
  well there is much older and more realistic idea of just doing a rail link tunnel and join it with rail baltica . 
  creating a direct continuous rail link from germany ( and the rest of the cetral european network ) into lapland . 
  also dragon does n't offer payload bay door and space exposure , which is the point of space rider . 
  opportunity to lift , expose to space for couple months and return . 
  this is essentially a temporary satellite platform with payload return capability at the end of mission . 
  where as dragon is a cargo pod . 
  completely different use cases .
