  it is snowing in the north . 
  maybe saariselk\u00e4 gets a second sumner opening after the one they held at beginning of june, 
  theoretically it is the duty of other council member nations to pressure the convicted nation in compliance . 
  estonia has been running on electronic government already since 90s . 
  two reasons as said by head of estonias it-center . 
  a ) they could n't afford not to do it . 
  when soviet union collapsed so collapsed it 's bureacracy , the gears that keep a country running . 
  estonia essentially dropped on top of nothing , since many of the offices very lead from moscow and relied on moscow . 
  so they had hulks of soviet offices and agencies , but no central government . 
  b ) their prime minister was a history teacher and did n't know this kind of reform was n't supposed to be possible . 
  as such whole of estonia was digitized in governing to save money essentially , because estonia could not afford the paper work . 
  whole of estonia runs on [ x-road ] ( https://e-estonia.com/component/x-road/ ) distributed e-service and communication protocol . 
  ( as will soon us finns , we adopted it from estonia and it is currently being put to full implementation . 
  actually eventually finlands e-governing platform and estonias e-governing platform will talk directly with each other to handle cross border bureacracy . ), 
  so estonia was on the it band wagon way before 2007 . 
  more like it was target of 2007 , because so much of it 's infrastructure is digitized , so it made a potent target . 
  however x-road is specifically designed for this . 
  due to it 's architectural design , individual services collapsed , but the whole system or rather network did n't collapse . 
  note x-road was introduced in to use in estonia initially in 2001 . 
  of course the means of production are hot . 
  it is from friction heating due to equipment running 24/7 at maximum capacity . 
  must keep the competition index high . 
  yeah . 
  to begin with pretty much all connections , even cheaper ones are unlimited in data amount . 
  the pricing is done on speed and priority etc. 
  like 5 $ a months gets one unlimited data , but at 500 kb/s . 
  10 $ gets one unlimited data at 1mb/s and around 20 $ gets one unlimited 50 mb/s and 30 $ gets one unlimited unlimited . 
  so as much data as one want at maximum network speed . 
  usually the one thing where there might still be a cap is priority traffic , meaning one has limited amount of highest priority traffic in congestion allocation . 
  after that is used the operator holds the right to bump down the speed to handle network congestion situations . 
  still if there is no congestion on the tower one gets unlimited unlimited as much as one wants . 
  not to mention operators literally just sell homerouters with 4g modems inbuild as homes main internet connection for badly cabled areas . 
  and it is no damn majority , bbc you skally wags . 
  it is plurality . 
  33 % is nowhere near majority , but apparently bbc does n't care of the mathematical meanings of such words like majority and plurality . 
  it is so irratating when in one sentence people speak of majority as in winning a plurality and then speak of majority in majority of parliament seats in next sentence . 
  usually then using this right use of majority to make the lesser win look more meaningfull . 
  like do n't try to justify the crazy minority win results by using two definitions for ` majority ' in two sentences next to each other . 
  it is plurality as it nearly always is in fptp election . 
  also known as minority rule . 
  not to mention then mixing in terms like major majority mandate , which is completely meaningless if 33 % can be majority in the same piece of text . 
  / rant about media not using mathematical definitions correctly ** over **, 
  mostly this is about trying to force two party system on a modern internet age politically diverse population . 
  it just does n't work . 
  fptp starts giving out crazy results and the more the two major parties in the two party system cling to the fptp to keep themselves in power , the more and more there is discontent among population . 
  eu will hardly have such grossly simplistic rules about it . 
  it will be 50 pages of calculations and approportions and speciality clauses to take account each nations situation . 
  but yes in general eu members will probably somewhat increase spending to compensate essentially for prepardness of usa not being part of defense calculations . 
  our neutral stance was always matter of practicality and `` no offensive military actions , please '' . 
  so finland very much does n't have problem with defense pacts . 
  heck we are in one already due to lisbon 42.7 . 
  rather the non warsow and non nato stance had to do more with those two being superpower led organization . 
  well soviets we did n't really like . 
  nato we could n't originally join due to soviets . 
  then both warsow and nato pacts showed that major players in them had a big hard on for offensive foreign military interventions , when at the same time finland was on un peacekeeping mission trying to build peace . 
  so let 's just say country of 5 million next to major power is not too keen on ** any ** major power using offensive military power as tool of biggest army diplomacy ( and makes us wary of any organization linked to said military power ) , because it might give ideas to the one major powers military right next to us . 
  usa using offensive military interventions gives defacto moral equality right for russia to claim right to also do offensive military intervention when they see fit : * the `` paragon '' of democracy is doing offensive wars , so we can do it also . 
  the thing is , when eu common defense goes through fully nato will not be dismantled , but it will become rather irrelevant due to it being duplicated by eu common defense and eu members rather doing stuff through eu internal institutions rather than external institutions like nato . 
  which means many eu members might still be nato members on paper , but 90 % of defense co-operation stuff will happen through eu framework rather than nato . 
   so ,   stop depending on us  fight for yourselves   is n't that what he wants ? 
  problem is for usa that those two come with : * be independent of us * be able to disagree with us in major ways and cause trouble for us, 
  should special snow flakes austria , ireland and finland also be recognized ? 
  i would like to see you to try to get ireland to join nato . 
  they are wary even of eu common defense and that is easy compared to hitching ones wagons with one specific superpower . 
   nato is ** motly ** about europe and that * mostly * is the the problem . 
  eu wants an defense alliance purely by and for eu common ** defense ** and ** absolutely ** nothing else . 
  also not all of eu is in nato and will not join , so nato simply wont fit the need . 
  actually the treaty for that is already in place in lisbon article 42.7 . 
  so mostly this eu army ( which will not be a single army , rather group of closely co-operating national armies and probably set of joint units by said countries . ), 
  will be about building the infrastructure for more effective practical implementation of lisbon 42.7 . 
  will eu do other stuff militarily ? 
  probably , but that is to be per case basis voluntary co-operation stuff and not a matter of treaty responsibility . 
  the funniest/saddest thing is that the main cause of trouble is not even constitutionally mandated , it just has so huge systemic internal staying power , that getting rid of it is near impossible . 
  that cause being first past the post as election system . 
  nowhere in usa constitution ( though some state constitution do usually define this ) does it say `` you shall use first past the post as election system . '' . 
  rather once it was adopted it started the vicious cycle of two party system , with the people in power having zero incentive on the levels that do decide about this ( state constitutions and congressional laws ) to do anything about it , since fptp keeps both republicans and democrats in power and everyone else outside . 
  really on the ground level on the level of issues usa is n't that polarized . 
  pretty much all of the common sense policies that would get support in europe also get good support in opinion polls in usa ( universal health care , campaign finance reforms etc. 
  etc. ) . 
  rather it is polarized on it 's party politics due to fptp , which casts the political system to polarization and thus grid lock . 
  which means usa will pull through , since the people are n't really that divided in the corest of core . 
  however it will sadly probably take somelevel of civil unrest to get to the point that the dismantling of the two party system and abandonment of fptp is possible , since usa has the most polarized and most corrupt and least contribution from third parties of the two party systems i know . 
  which means usa pretty much has to rip two party system out of dncs and rncs dead hands before ripping it to pieces after some civil unrest to topple dnc & rnc . 
  unless the democratic revolters manage to revolt democratic establishemnt to such degree , that democratic revolters topple dnc internally completely , win a supermajority in congress completely and then take advantage of the fact that usa congress can change and over rule the states on congressional election rules with a simple law to rip fptp to pieces . 
  which by the way is crazy , that it is that easy to change the election rules . 
  ** usually ** these are constitutionally defined matters . 
  which they kinda are , since state constitutions define it . 
  however someone left this gem in usa constitution :  the times , places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives , * shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof * ; but the ** congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations ** , except as to the places of choosing senators . 
  well trying to have good neighborly relations with russia is a defacto given for eu , since being neighbors is a permanent geographical non-alterable fact . 
  so you have to have neighborly relations with russia want it or not and one usually always atleast tries to have good relations with neighbors . 
  outside of science circles . 
  given that he is an active professor he probably goes to fair amount of international conferences and science meetings etc. 
  media just does n't cover those things very much . 
  not sure , but i 'm thinking it means technocrats from the various ministeries as junior ministers . 
  also even in europe police does release information , ** if ** it is necessary for investigative reasons . 
  usually the exactly opposite is true . 
  releasing the suspects identity , will lead to false reports of them being seen . 
  eye witnesses are notoriously unreliable to begin with and to give them something to associate their vague memories to leads to false reports . 
  `` yeah i totally saw that max guy , totally saw him , he looks exactly like the describtion in this morning 's yellow press . '', 
  aka releasing the identity can throw the investigation to wrong track and in worts case can cause the case to collapse in trial , if it is found out late that eyewitness has erred or lied based on police releasing information .
