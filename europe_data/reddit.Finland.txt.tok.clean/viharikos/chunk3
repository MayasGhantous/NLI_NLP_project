  gee , it 's not like they 're getting paid by welfare to do so, 
  can you prove that claim with statistic fact , and not resorting to emotional argument that 's based on article featuring single guy , or worse nothing but personal bias ? 
  it 's true because i said so ? 
  no , better yet : it 's true because i think so . 
  it 's almost if having bigger work force willing to work for lesser pays is good and having bigger welfare recipient group is bad, 
   in 2014 there were 38,767 people who were removed from the uk or departed voluntarily after the initiation of removal . 
  that 's like weekend during summer since last year , for the arrivals, 
  yeah , because we can expect the number not swell , like it did n't do last year . 
  nope , totally not having trouble keeping infrastructure even as it is . 
  nope . 
  it 's not like they 're coming from other side of the world , ignoring other eu countries without welfare and only coming to countries with benefits . 
  nope . 
  it 's not like the vast majority is 18-25 year old men , who left women and children behind . 
  nope . 
  it 's always been after all women and children who fight against fascism and tyranny while men flee , that 's how civilizations prosper, 
  those with puppetry master degrees have to eat too, 
  do you even know what neonazi is or do you just use it to insult people you do n't like and do n't agree with ? 
  everyone i do n't like is literal hitler ?

  aftonbladet biased , just with another narrative ? 
  sweden has failed to be tolerant enough and it has caused all this, 
  i do n't think the remote chance winning in sports is worth in trillions for welfare and decreased sense of security not when you are playing against the countries where they came from anyways . 
  has multiculturalism benefited native population in any way when the immigration has been done from mena countries ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested on this . 
  for finland it certainly has n't . 
  i doubt it 's much different for everyone that does n't seek to exploit cheap workforce for quick bucks . 
  but on a national level . 
  great britain , the promised land of child molesters . 
  what a fucking shit hole it has turned into, 
  this is good thing right ? 
  we should n't bribe turkey so we can control our borders we should n't bribe them so the 10 million in waiting in turkey would be granted nationality via turkey politics and be free to flood to europe . 
  orban did the right call . 
  in this thread but the correlation between the usage of the 2 is not far fetched in my opinion in this case and i do n't think we need to pretend there 's no correlation either, 
  so , we bring these people in order to help them , but it ends up with situation where women should n't walk outside without hijab ? 
  who exactly we 're saving these people from ? 
  from themselves ? 
  [ yet it has 90 % sunni muslim population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_afghanistan ) is there any country in the world without oil and prospering muslim majority population ? 
  - cut 500m + from education - increase 500m + for immigration immediate costs . . yeah, 
  brace yourselves , summer is coming . 
  they had pretty catchy song too , would join/5 but i 'd probably get executed for oversleeping and eating pig : /,

  what part of funneling funds you do n't understand ? 
  so we ca n't afford those in the first place ? 
  better funnel that money for people that whine about food and how boring it is in here . 
  seems like sound investment instead of education . 
  and it 'd ultimately would double our unemployed before the family unifications , which i 'm pretty sure we ca n't afford anymore , i do n't know if you are serious or just being asshole while trolling . 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/paaministerin_erityisedustaja_tuhannet_valmistelevat_lahtoa_irakissa/8696540 http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php and we already cut our pensions and education to accommodate 33,000 . 
  what would double that number do in short time span ? 
  we received those 33,000 thorough last year , not in the span of 2-3 months . 
  [ 1/5 ca n't read in their native language , 1/10 can speak english , there 's no mentioning of how many can write in latin but we can assume the number is less than 1/10 ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/tem_turvapaikanhakijoista_vain_harvalla_edes_ammatillinen_koulutus/8661385 ) . 
  we 're directly allocating funds from cut pensions and education to immigration immediate costs , cut 500m from education allocate the 500m + to immigration immediate costs . 
  unless you mean we can afford to bare strip healthcare , welfare , pensions and education so we can accommodate people that leave because it 's too boring , and whilst doing so turn into 3rd world status , then no , we ca n't afford this kind of insane shit . 
  yeah but it 's not nearly as bad , primarily because we never had as much immigrants . 
  oh boy will things change quick, 
  eastern eu will probably skyrocket in generation , more immigrants we take the more likely white flight becomes . 
  it 's cheap to live in there currently and buying houses does n't mean you have to pay for it 30 years . 
  not to mention it [ will become safer very soon in there when compared to countries with high amount immigrants ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/maahanmuuttajien_korkeaan_raiskaustilastoon_ei_loydy_yhta_patevaa_syyta/7877771 ), 
  ah i was unclear what i meant , it 's because more resources are put for welfare and such to upkeep facade ultimately , when there are fewer swedes to pay for it , you have to increase taxes to be able to upkeep the situation . 
  all scandinavian countries are pretty expensive on taxes though , and you 'll receive less and less . 
  currently there 's decades long queues for housing in cities in sweden so i do n't know how unlike the situation will be , and the fact that they keep taking insane amounts of people does n't help, 
  nah it 's speculation how massive amounts of swedes will snowball effect out of sweden to norway because of increased taxes and increased amount immigrants . 
  the fewer there are people paying taxes , more likely it is that more will leave for norway . 
  pretty much waiting the breaking point currently, 
  about 13 000 iraqis are getting passports today daily , from which 26 % headed last year to finland . 
  now imagine that there 's 10 000 people getting passport daily and say 15 % of them head to finland ... 6 * 30 * 10 000 * 0.15 = 270 000 iraqis at case where we tune down the numbers and expect we get less proportionate immigrants than we did last year , which was 33 000 and 26 % of all iraqis headed to finland . 
  not to mention expect that the trend does n't increase . 
  we 're going to have civil war at our hands if things do n't change before that happens . 
  i 'm not exaggerating , we do n't have the money , resources or people to handle that many people . 
  either we kick them all or we 'll create pseudo concentration camp with scarce resources . 
  we 'd effectively double our unemployed and these people are illiterate in latin alphabets , and 1/5 ca n't write in arab . 
  only 1/10 can speak english . 
  there are no jobs for young people and people are getting fed up with this bullshit already . 
  i do n't think taking people from 3rd world will fix any of those , instead it plays out badly for normal guy, 
  first of all , the majority is young male 2nd it 's their home , if they do n't defend it , who will ? 
  how would europe look if rest of european men would 've fled after nazis got in power and decided to destroy europe ? 
  3rd these people are going back voluntarily , thousands among thousands have already returned from finland . 
  if it 's so dangerous why they 're fleeing boredom to return to the so called sharia-infested murder/rape zone ? 
  is boredom so bad for these people so they 'd rather get killed or raped ? 
  well there are other points but i 'm too lazy to write them out and you can figure out the pattern with common sense with the ones i gave you . 
  but my take is that , no it 's not so bad in there . 
  if snow and mashed potatoes are too much for them to endure i ca n't really imagine they 're suffering that much in iraq . 
  i meant to post this for the other guy that replied to you , but to prevent next smartass without common sense i decided to post these points . 
  yeah there 's really no better way to spend your holidays , book flight to russia , come to finland during summer and get paid to leave . 
  abso-fucking-lutely insane politics . 
  i just wish we 'd go bankrupt already , people will get mad as fuck when that happens , and that 's not so far away at this pace . 
  what the fuck are we ? 
  a fucking holiday resort where we pay for your stay ? 
  and you fucking have audacity to call these people refugees ? 
  people that think it 's too boring and leave after a while . 
  fuck this world and everyone in it . 
  especially these fucking people . 
   actually all countries with universal healthcare i.e. 
  high taxes have poor economic growth and big debt , so it won ` t last forever anyway . 
  and i just proved you to be wrong . 
  on world scale scandinavian countries got least amount debt despite the free healthcare , education and welfare we provide . 
  it 's not exactly bad example . 
  no but having those people go through government sponsored education for over a decade and finishing as unemployed bum is quite expensive , especially with our current system . 
  we should n't have unrealistic career options in here, 
  i do n't think we should consider what 's fair , but what 's practical,
