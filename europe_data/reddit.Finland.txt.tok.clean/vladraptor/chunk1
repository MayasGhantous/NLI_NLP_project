no need to be sorry because of me . 
  i just thought that you have very nice national symbols . 
  you have really good looking coat of arms , especially the greater one with oak leaves . 
  your national flower is blue cornflower , which is a beautiful flower . 
  your national bird is the barn swallow , one my personal favourites - there is no summer day 's night better than the one where you can sit and relax while listening and watching the swallows darting in the air . 
  so you could have depicted , say a pair of swallows flying over a field of cornflowers , but no - you opted to have a map of estonia and to me that seems a bit boring . 
  [ like this ] ( http://www.eratukku.fi/static/media/images/37/original/37a590dc9cd365108ac507fce474e76e.png ), 
  i rather liked our [ 100 markka note ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_markka#banknotes ) , but i 'm rather partial . 
  you mean :  we went pure ~ ~ nationalist ~ ~ boring !, 
  speaking of the euro coins , i got a [ special 2 euro coin ] ( http://www.eurokolikot.com/2-euro-kolikot/2012-euro-10-vuotta/suomi-2012-2-euro-euro-10-vuotta-unc ) in small change yesterday . 
  i stopped converting to the old currency quite early . 
  the only benefit of not being very good at calculating things without the help of a calculator . 
  i do remember looking at my first euro payslip and thinking how small and disappointing my salary seemed . 
   in france , a lot of people believe that the price of everything increased as we switched to euros same in finland . 
  my grandmother was convinced that shops rounded up when we switched to the euro , even when the statistics say that it did n't happen . 
  also people rarely count in the inflation when comparing prices now and then - they just claim that everything is more expensive , conveniently forgetting that their salary is also bigger now than it was then . 
  you could have made your euro coins look cultured . 
  he kept saying ` eu ' but i thought that you are supposed to pronounce that as ` oi ' , like oiropa and oiro in europa and euro . 
  honestly i do n't remember . 
  only thing i do remember is a big explosion , buildings crumpling and people wandering about in the ruins . 
  that is interesting , thank you . 
  we too have a concept of written and spoken language in finnish , which sometimes confuses the foreigners trying to learn the language . 
  true and changes in farming means that we no longer need cats as much as we did before and people really should think about keeping cats as an indoor pets only . 
   the worst part is that they just do it for fun cats are animals they do n't hunt for fun - humans do . 
  they hunt because they have a strong instinct for it and humans have benefitted by using cats as pest control . 
  humans have had cats over 3000 years and to solely blame cats for the sudden decline of other animal species is , in my humble opinion , dishonest - i believe we 'll find the real culprit far closer simply by looking in the next mirror . 
  even if the king would have become a figurehead without real political powers ? 
  or would the idea of a head of state without the power been too alien to french kings ? 
  indeed i was !, 
  you have had too many revolutions , it 's not easy to keep up with them , 
  sorry , i meant during the cold war when poland was a socialist country not now after the cold war . 
  i remember that my father worked on construction site in the former soviet union in 80 's and brought russian chocolate as souvenir to us kids . 
  it was horrible !, 
  my grandfather has a set of slides from ddr . 
  a set of famous buildings in berlin or something like that . 
  only thing i remember is that there were no people in those pictures - only empty streets and buildings . 
  i remember watching a british tv-drama of a nuclear attack on british islands and for couple of months i was terrified about the nuclear war . 
  other than finding an odd estonian channel when tuning your television and those things above , i do n't really remember that much about the cold war . 
   my grandpa has sold a forest in zakopane sorry about my ignorance but i always thought that the land was the property of the state . 
   in some instances grammar is more different . 
  can you give examples ? 
  to my understanding there are no big differences in grammar and yes there are some words that have different meanings or are not used in the other country but differences can also be found within sweden between different dialects . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?l=en&amp;s=205 ) is what the institute for the languages of finland have to say about swedish , finnish swedish and the institute 's mandate . 
   how to sort huge societal problems but does n't china has huge problems that it has n't really been able to sort out ? 
  things seem to be calm but under the surface there are several problems with minorities and social injustice - a worker 's paradise which is no paradise if you are not rich . 
  i saw a documentary about letters that the french people sent to the king before the revolution . 
  if i remember correctly there was a period when the subjects of the throne were encouraged to write and complain . 
  unfortunately the king was n't very competent and did nothing . 
  i got the feeling that if he had acted and tried to solve the problems you might still have a king . 
  i 'm slightly disappointed that our own [ johan b\u00e4ckman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b%c3%a4ckman ) is not among them . 
  who knows - he might like it and stay there . 
   the spiritual diplomacy foundation what an odd name . 
  i 'll take it that it is some sort of a religious group but something like [ this ] ( https://colleenday.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/spiritualism-granger.jpg ) comes to my mind with a name like that . 
  i have a feeling that people lose their shit , as you put it , when an american claims to have a special knowledge or take sides on matters , which has nothing to do with the usa or its citizens , simply because he or she has ancestors from that part of europe . 
  i do n't mind an american giving his or her opinion on something but i do find it somewhat irritating when an american , for example , is telling scotland to be free of the english tyranny because `` you know , i 'm scottish too ! '', 
  ( i definitely am not scottish , by the way ) . 
   i 've commonly heard american blacks here in the u.s. complain about perceived unfair treatment in europe . 
  for example ? 
  i 'm just curious how they have been treated unfairly ? 
  as if drinking would cheer us up . 
  it only induces alcoholism and that is really depressing . 
  i think it is the picture of mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk . 
  first president of modern turkey and the leader of the group that ousted the ottoman sultans - if i remember my history lessons correctly . 
  did n't realise that i 'm required to hate you . 
  do you mind if i do n't ? 
   there 's no point in making eventual rehabilitation even more difficult by publishing convicts ' names . 
  that 's true although i probably would n't remember anybody 's name if not reminded when someone is released . 
  yes , i see that - thank you . 
  i 'm not an american , i have no clue nor do i understand what the benefit of having such a sentence is . 
  edit : no clue other than the prisoner will die in prison like / u/h _ ivy said . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  different mindset i would guess . 
  i believe that in america one can get a sentence that is longer than your natural lifespan . 
  interesting . 
  how well are people 's names kept as a secret or are there leaks to the newspapers ? 
  `` the regional court in w\u00fcrzburg did not publish the man 's name , in line with german privacy rules . '', 
  interesting . 
  in finland the name is published if the sentence is two years or longer . 
  what kind of a conviction you should get to have your name published in germany ? 
  not that i 'm seeking that kind of publicity - just curious . 
  a fact which i 'm not disputing . 
   i 'm not condoning russia 's actions except part of condoning those actions if officially recognise that crimea is part of russia . 
  not de jure it is not and i think that fifa should stick with that . 
  no jaa ... 
  it 's nice hymn but i do n't really see reason to change the [ current national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzz_uk8flmq ) , which is national anthem by convention only . 
  edit : less lofty songs but which i like : [ tuulen tunto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypdovxwxuwg ) and [ i riden s\u00e5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpr56pxilqy ) . 
  first one is from v\u00e4rttin\u00e4 and is folk song from eastern finland . 
  second one is a song by gjallarhorn , a group that sings swedish folk songs from western finland and sometimes in finnish , like [ suvetar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od_tirx7zu0 ) . 
  what do you know !, 
  first result of google video search for the `` wetten , dass . . ? '', 
  oktober in erfurt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qulevxplkk ) . 
  unfortunately i too would need a german man speaking to my ear when watching that . 
  have your co-workers been in europe ? 
  somehow i have a feeling that they have n't . 
  there might be individuals who do n't like foreigners , koreans included , but i do n't remember ever hearing anybody saying that asians are ugly . 
  i 've seen a documentary how koreans are eager to use plastic surgery to change their appearance more western like , for example having eyelid surgery , but i do n't believe that you have have one to be accepted in europe . 
  changing name in finland is pretty easy and straightforward process but to my understanding you have to be a finn to do it . 
  there are some rules about the names , so you can not have anything you want as your name . 
  that \u00e6 and the \u00f8 look wrong , so wrong . 
  i wonder how that would work .
