  they say that their vote wo n't count if the candidate that they have voted did not , or they think that will not , get elected . 
  but it does . 
  that is also why you should think which party to vote . 
  not only the candidate . 
  if you vote for very liberal candidate from conservative party and your candidate did n't get through your vote still might help some other candidate , whose ideas you do n't share , to be elected . 
  you put the ` x ' on that party 's circle that you wish to vote . 
  does that list of candidates also mean the order of which the party will assign votes for them ? 
  for example if the left ( die linke ) would get two seats , those seats would go to the first two on that list ( dr koch-mehrin and count lambsdorff ) ? 
  polling stations have candidate lists that look like [ this ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/savo/article5341526.ece/alternates/w580/%c3%a4%c3%a4nest%c3%a4j%c3%a4_ehdokaslista_eduskuntavaalit_2011_pohjoissavo ) and [ this ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/incoming/article6271230.ece/alternates/w960/vaalipiiri+vaalipiiriuudistus ) . 
  as others have said you then copy the number of the candidate on the ballot but only the number . 
  anything else on it and the ballot becomes invalid . 
  samples are from small constituencies and that is why there are not so many names . 
  in bigger ones , like helsinki and uusimaa , the list covers all three sides of the polling booth . 
  ah yes , the woman with vision - [ to russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxl86v8nogk ) . 
  this is getting off topic but i 'm curious why the congress does not want puerto rico to become a state ? 
  and which one has the best playlist on his or her ipod . 
  and best of all : you can let loose your artistic talents as seen on those ballots . 
  funny thing is that 2009 the parish of oulu used [ this ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/468/1288332268696.jpg ) as a logo for a campaign to young adults . 
  not everyone liked it . 
  no worries , no feathers ruffled , 
  nor would i , as many finns have a swedish or russian names . 
  just wondering whether he is an anti-immigrant immigrant ( and the irony of it if he was ) . 
  is he himself from an immigrant family ? 
  is n't messerschmidt a german name ? 
  thank you for the correction . 
  for some reason our biggest daily newspaper , helsingin sanomat , has wrong turnout at their results service : \u00c4\u00e4nestysprosentti 39.1 % -1.2, 
  with 100 % of the votes counted the results from finland look like this : ncp ( conservatives ) ** 3 ** ( 22.6 % , -0.6 % ) centre ** 3 ** ( 19.7 % , +0.6 % ) ( true ) finns ** 2 ** ( +1 ) ( 12.9 % , +3.1 % ) sdp ** 2 ** ( 12.3 % , -5.2 % ) green league ** 1 ** ( -1 ) ( 9.3 % , -3.1 % ) left alliance ** 1 ** ( +1 ) ( 9.3 % , +3.4 % ) spp ( swedish people party ) ** 1 ** ( 6.7 % , +0.7 % ) christian democrats ** 0 ** ( -1 ) ( 5.2 % , +1.1 % ) others ( various smaller parties or groups ) ** 0 ** ( 2 % ) voter turnout 40.9 % , +0.6 % edit : corrected the voter turnout edit2 : bolded the number of seats for clarity, 
  and denmark is what ? 
  could you amend the parliament of uk so that house of lords would be the house for whole uk and house of commons only for england ? 
  of course in that case you probably should change the way you elect the lords . 
  found a news clip from summer 2012 were they say that number of violations was 15 . 
  equal number of them were made by russia and sweden . 
  one less was made by planes from usa . 
  source in finnish : http://areena.yle.fi/tv/1575967, 
  well are n't we lucky . 
  there is a magic barrier stopping the flooding at the mouth of gulf of bothnia !, 
  or you could just claim the southern sweden back . 
  i do wonder why irish is called iiri in finnish . 
  edit : i was n't trying to make any kind of comment what irish language should or should not be called in other languages . 
  just wondering why we finns call it iiri and not irlanti . 
  usually name of the language is the same as the name of the country ( saksa/saksa/saksalainen = germany/german/german person ) . 
  did n't find anything from internet that would explain the name in finnish but i did stumble on an article of a finn , panu h\u00f6glund , that has written and translated novels to irish ( [ here ] ( http://tuomasmuraja.com/?page_id=1090 ) , but it is in finnish ) . 
  indeed - that was my point also , just used basque as an example , 
  perfect !, 
  now i just have to arrange all my appointments at half past 8 whenever i 'm in france . 
  had to try it in finnish : valtiollisep\u00e4siveellismielipideterrorismi does not really conform to the rules of finnish language . 
  it probably should be more like : ep\u00e4siveellinen valtiollinen mielipideterrorismi . 
  oh i envy you so much !, 
  i too know how to ask the time but i would not understand the answer . 
  basque probably is not that widespread but it adds to the number of people to whom spanish is the second language . 
  or because spain has regional languages , like catalan and basque , and spanish is not their first language ? 
  for some reason i was expecting to see polish being popular in lithuania . 
  how common is it to own a car in big cities like new york or chicago ? 
  we simply must send him to the eurovision song contest . 
  jeah , ca n't stand them non-indo ... no , wait ... 
  you mean \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 ? 
  it is the flag of [ council of europe ] ( http://hub.coe.int/ ) . 
  although i can understand the confusion as eu has same flag and that does not represent whole europe . 
  nope , but i do remember trying to memorise french verbs . 
  wanted to learn french so i could read french and belgian comics - well , never learned enough to read comics but i know how to order a cup of coffee !, 
  pitty that i do n't like it , 
  on the positive side there is no gender and only one irregular verb . 
  15 declensions and four tenses . 
  [ it is really easy !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qfm6sce.png ) or atleast i think it is - easier than frech was when i was trying to learn it . 
  at least we have coffee for you . 
  i feel so guilty about laughing at this . 
  clearly !, 
  my supposedly german heart would find soulmates from czech republic and austria so in reality i 'm from pyh\u00e4 saksalais-roomalainen keisarikunta or as ~ ~ they ~ ~ we say [ heiliges r\u00f6misches reich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_roman_empire ) . 
  a test not to be taken too seriously and apparently i 'm german at heart . 
  edit : typo , as i 'm not a deer ( hart ) , 
  edit : as an old cat , she likes to sleep alot and [ this time against my arm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/che5zrf.jpg ) . 
  i once , when working in a call centre , had a customer from n\u00e4rpes and i could not understand a word he said . 
  had to ask a colleague of mine , whose mother tongue was swedish , to call him back . 
  he too had problems understanding the customer as my colleague spoke [ h\u00f6gsvenska ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%b6gsvenska ) or `` the standard finnishswedish '' . 
  for those who are interested here are couple of examples of rauma dialect : [ 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi3mynhyh34 ) and [ 2 ] ( http://scripta.kotus.fi/av/lataamo/kuuntele/1a_rauma.mp3 ) . 
  rauma is a tough one as they use loanwords from swedish that are not the ones we use in standard finnish or words that are a bit archaic . 
  for myself the eastern finnish dialects are also pretty hard when ( if ) they use local vocabulary and then there are words that have different meaning depending where you are like classic ` viruttaa ' which in west means ` to rinse ' and in the east ` to stretch ' . 
  we had them in our local supermarket at christmastime . 
  probably imported because of their colour . 
  listening estonian is interesting . 
  you can recognise some words ( like ema = [ em\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/em%c3%a4 ) = \u00e4iti = mother ) and get a very broad idea what people are talking about but you also get confused very easily since there are a lot of false friends like piim ( milk ) vs piim\u00e4 ( a type of buttermilk ) . 
  the lack of [ vowel harmony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony#finnish ) does make estonian sound a bit strange . 
  if i understood it correctly they started the interview talking about the most meaningful ( important ) thing that happened in her life this year i.e. 
  becoming a mother . 
  we had ban on dancing ( it was actually ban on organising public events ) as well from 1968 to 2002 . 
  the ban was relaxed gradually and by the end you had to get a permission to organise one from the police in advance and practically everyone got it . 
  2002 the law was amended and the ban lifted . 
  in my childhood long fridays ( as we call good friday ) really were long and boring . 
  looks more like poland sank it , `` if we can not have it , nobody can have it '' . 
  well ... is n't it like dancing on jesus ' grave ? 
  you are not the only ones , 
  [ relevant ] ( http://youtu.be/u2r7vnjh1t4?t=8m51s ) ? 
  are you estonian by any change ? 
  i would love if we too would have a `` proper '' medieval city , like you have . 
  instead everything here was build out of wood and it has all burned many times over . 
  you do n't say ... [ if only it would stay at turku ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/turku/article5861050.ece/alternates/w580/irina+nordman+ja+jarkko+virtanen+mont+blanc ) , 
  nor have i. i did try to find a picture of it in use and this one from 2012 was the only one that i did find . 
  it is quite nice . 
  here are official instruction for the use and style of the coat of arms and on the last page there are also pictures of the pennants and the flag .
