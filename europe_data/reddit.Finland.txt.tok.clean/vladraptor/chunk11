  actually we have a flag for helsinki . 
  flag in the picture has wrong dimensions , i think , but the `` content '' is right . 
  i for one have never seen it flown , as far as i can remember . 
  i would n't say they are ugly but a bit boring . 
  i did n't realise that the image in the coins was chosen by popular vote . 
  i always thought that it was a result of some compromise in a committee . 
  pitty that you do n't have your coat of arms in the coins - you have very nice one . 
  i always thought that the states in the united states of america can not leave the ( american ) union and therefore can not enter another union . 
  did n't southern states try this and it resulted a civil war ? 
  having a fear of heights i could never imagine myself buying a flat from skyscraper . 
  kippurah\u00e4nt\u00e4 was new one . 
  knew the kissanh\u00e4nt\u00e4 and might have even used it from time to time in the good old times . 
  hence the `` i feel old ... '' thingy , 
  funny how there is regional differences . 
  i 'm from helsinki - well originally from j\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 but that 's basically the same . 
  are you saying that you never heard term ` kissanh\u00e4nt\u00e4 ' ? 
  i feel old ... 
  i remember it being called ` kissanh\u00e4nt\u00e4 ' ( = cat 's tail ) but that was somewhat cumbersome so people started to call it miukumauku . 
  nowadays you rarely hear anyone call it anything other than ' \u00e4t - merkki ' or simply ' \u00e4t ' . 
  a bicyclecade then ? 
  i see . 
  i was wondering whether he used helicopters all the time and that did seem a bit excessive , even for the president of usa . 
  that would have been my guess - somehow heads of state do n't usually have to suffer from traffic jams , 
  why helicopters ? 
  do n't they usually have a motorcade ? 
  thank you for your answer . 
  i do remember that incident as it was in the news quite often at that time . 
  just out of curiosity , how pro-russian estonian russians are , if they are at all ? 
  yes , but somehow i do n't think their reasons will stop putin caring for them . 
  indifference mainly i would think although media , yellow press especially , gets excited if a someone of finnish roots does something special or is a celebrity . 
  i do n't think that my family has any member that has emigrated but a friend of mine has some distant family members in us . 
  i can remember him only once commenting about them saying that they spoke funny finnish ie finglish . 
  overwhelming feeling of loneliness in that painting . 
  even the couple sitting there seems as they are strangers to each other . 
  i like nighthawks . 
  for some reason i find it to be both intriguing and disturbing . 
  you are right and sorry , i somehow managed to skip word `` fluent '' . 
  that is true for the younger generations maybe , but when the older generations ( people who now are over 60 ) were at school the german was far more popular than english . 
  my guess is that they are the reason why finland has such a high percentage . 
  at first i thought it was a bad joke ... 
   the next 2 most popular candidates ( toom and k\u00f5lvart ) scare me even more why ? 
  if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  had to check our lyrics and there is a reference to soul but no mentioning of the god . 
  if the finnish wikipedia is correct your national anthem , like ours , is n't one by law but by custom . 
  you ca n't make omelets without broken cycles !, 
  thank you - i was just curious , no ulterior motives . 
  just out of curiosity : if one were to ask your avare estonian who old estonia is what would his or her answer be ? 
   you are 61.4 % european , and you scored closest to belgium , with a similarity of 74.4 % !, 
  so , i 'm almost belgian ? 
  what does those phrases mean ? 
  why would you watch eurovision on youtube ? 
  and i guess her song was ok and i do n't really have an opinion on her but i liked the netherlands song that year . 
   the only time they used metric do n't you mean imperial ? 
  i had french as a 3rd language ( chose french because i like french comics ) and the grammar was a nightmare and i concur that knowing english did n't help with the vocabulary . 
  then i changed schools and the new one did n't offer french so that was that and now i can barely remember pronunciation rules . 
  yeah , but you were n't meant to join the sith . 
  i 'll take it that you meant that the narrator was not a native english speaker ? 
  i liked that he did n't sound british or american , it made the video sound more authentic . 
   a few years after that years ? 
  have you been sleeping at school ? 
  winter war ended in march 1940 and continuation war started june 1941 . 
  the treaty after winter war - i would n't call it amicable . 
  we already have . 
  interesting . 
  finnish too has term puolip\u00e4iv\u00e4 but it means noon . 
  luckily youtube has automatic closed captions otherwise i might not have understood anything . 
  it 's the posh part that you did n't like , right ? 
  and not very useful words in polite company , one might add . 
  the officials were expecting ( more like hoping ) masses of tourists so to provide additional accommodation tent villages were erected for them . 
  that village in the photo was for 6000 but only 350 persons used it ( so the estimates were slightly off ) . 
  all together there were tent villages for 14000 persons . 
  they even built running water and toilets to the area . 
  that 's what the caption essentially says . 
  edit : my own comments in brackets, 
  i believe you . 
  the site did n't really give any indication that there is text under the picture . 
  you 'll have to know to scroll down for it . 
  however you are not wrong in them being meant for accommodation in the olympics , just not for the athletes . 
  i wonder why you did n't read your source . 
  those tents are not for the athletes . 
  have a party ? 
  i do n't recall there being any special thing for the 50th birthday . 
  the parties have changed . 
  i remember when my grandmother had hers . 
  it was very formal one - coffee and [ voileip\u00e4kakku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sm%c3%b6rg%c3%a5st%c3%a5rta ) , people wearing shoos indoors , etc. 
  there even was a delegation from the union she was member of and from the municipality , which was her employer . 
  nowadays the parties seem much more relaxed . 
  no more delegations and you 'll invite the people you want , not the whole extended family . 
  technically no . 
  citizens of the nordic countries have somewhat broader rights than the eu citizens . 
  around 40,000 moved to finland and there are roughly 30,000 estonian migrant workers here ( some sources claimed 100,000 ) . 
  also [ this picture of the bodies of the victims being transported ] ( http://www.hameensanomat.fi/sites/default/files/images/4383800053_0.jpg ) . 
   first they have some latin program [ nuntii latini ] ( http://areena.yle.fi/1-1931339 ) , for those who are interested - a weekly news programme . 
  [ jenni haukio , spouse of the president of the republic of finland ] ( http://www.presidentti.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=244926&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ), 
   she 's cute , but also actually ~ ~ a robot ~ ~ . 
  an android, 
  it 's not as if niinist\u00f6 lived in penury before elected as the president . 
  i thought he was rather controversial figure . 
  of non english-language ones i do like pedro almodovar 's films , can not decide which one is the best . 
  i also liked sandrine veysset 's french film y aura-t-il de la neige \u00e0 no\u00ebl ?
