  / will it snow for christmas ? 
  [ there is only two ways ( or methods ) of having sex : the right one and wrong ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zxqkzxrce ) . 
  a finnish awareness video for condom use from 1989 . 
  i remember seeing that in the tv when i was a teenager . 
  no worries and i was n't trying to be offencive - i hope none taken . 
  by the way i have heard estonian . 
  first time as a child in the 80 's when tuning the tv we came across an estonian tv-channel . 
  the name you chose not the language !, 
  to my ear estonia sounds a bit russian but whatever you decide to call yourselves in english to me you 'll always be viro . 
  to be honest i do n't know . 
  as it is a mixture of spirits and cognac my guess is after with coffee . 
  i do n't really like the taste of alcohol so personally i would not drink it - unless i was in a very formal party and no flowerpot nearby . 
  yes , from proto-germanic kuningaz . 
  also there is the ruhtinas which comes from proto-germanic druhtinaz and means a prince or a f\u00fcrst , not to be confused with prinssi , which means the son or the male heir of the sovereign . 
  in finland the term viina can also mean other types of alcohol drinks like [ jaloviina - \u00c4delbr\u00e4nnvin ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/66/58/50/665850421c90bac22e47a3607319bf7d.jpg ) . 
  well he is n't actually speaking swedish just saying random words in between the finnish narration , like `` damen and kvinnor '' , `` b\u00e4sta tittare '' , etc. 
  he is also deliberately using some of them incorrectly . 
  he 's actually saying some swedish words and phrases . 
  i just realised that i have no clue what is a general term for clear strong alcoholic drink in english . 
  thank you !, 
  hmm ... 
  interesting . 
  you could say '' \u00c4l\u00e4 kata '' in finnish but the word `` kata '' has a bit different meaning nowadays and usually it would be translated as `` do not set ( the dinner table ) '' . 
  kattaa , from which the kata comes , does mean to cover something . 
  so what is `` do not cover '' ? 
  i 'll take it that companies usually use bokm\u00e5l and not nynorsk ? 
  yeah , bloody dane !, 
  thank you for the answer . 
  we too , like germany , have a church tax and that probably is one reason why leaving a church is regulated by a law . 
  sorry about the stupid question but is that legal ? 
  i mean here the freedom of religion act states that everybody has the freedom to join or leave a religious community or a church . 
  and if for some reason the said community would refuse to accept your resignation ( which would be illegal ) you can still simply file the paperwork at the local register office and from that day forward you are no longer a member of that community . 
  what did the parades commission do ? 
   i do n't know i have n't read it . 
  [ here 's the relevant section of the constitution ( in finnish ) ] ( https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990731#l4p53 ) and yes , only non-binding referendums in finland . 
   it sounds like an emotionless stream of words if you think french is emotionless i do wonder what you would think about finnish ... 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://swedia.ling.gu.se/finland/osterbotten/narpes/ow.html ) and [ another one ] ( http://swedia.ling.gu.se/finland/osterbotten/narpes/ym.html ) . 
  i once tried to help someone from n\u00e4rpes when i was working in a call centre . 
  i could manage southern dialects of swedish spoken in finland but no such luck with n\u00e4rpes . 
  joined ? 
  i thought it was an invitation and declining was not an option - the soviets rsvp 'd on your behalf . 
  [ here 's the classic snow queen ] ( http://www.ts.fi/static/content/pic_5_733428_733434_1200.jpg ) by rudolf koivu . 
  i was baffled by the character from the movie frozen before reading the legend . 
  i thought he was carrying empty bottles in those plastic bags . 
  google is n't that good with idioms . 
  ` menn\u00e4 ' means literally ` to go ' , ` move from one place or point to another ' . 
  edit : i would also use ` v\u00e4h\u00e4n ' ( some , little ) since ` tee ' ( tea ) is not countable in this case . 
  if you say that you would like `` some cups of tea '' ( joitain kuppeja teet\u00e4 ) then you use ` joitain ' as you can count the number of cups of tea . 
  i hope this was n't too confusing , 
  oslo , ca n't give any specific reason why but i do like it . 
  and go into a coffee shop in finland and ask for a pulla and you 'll get [ one of these ] ( http://personal.inet.fi/palvelu/juhlasaliin/kuvat/pulla1.jpg ) . 
   removing basic constitutional rights from men such as ? 
  not to be too pedantic but [ fins ] ( http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/generalized_anxiety_slideshow/getty_rm_photo_of_shark_fins_in_water.jpg ) vs. [ finns ] ( http://www.iskelma.fi/files/content_800/2012_05_12_4fadebb08ec7a.jpg ) . 
  well there has to be some perks to be a full member or everyone would just settle for some sort of an association agreement with the eu . 
  congratulations sweden !, 
  but we know our metal so they better be really good one . 
  i see , did n't know that . 
  thank you !, 
  why tomorrow and not as soon as the polling stations close ? 
  no points for czech republic , or am i missing something ? 
  i think they are catherine the great and alexander ii but i have no clue why they are on a coin . 
  northern part was under danish rule in the middle ages . 
   a sexual harassment lawsuit sexually harassed by a coin ? 
  who would you sue , ecb ? 
  have n't really made up my mind but i have been thinking about the netherlands or denmark . 
  it started in finland but it has spread . 
  [ here 's a map for today ] ( http://www.maplantis.com/map?event-map=54f32496ec7d8b4cc634272a ) . 
  he meant [ these areas ] ( http://tartonrauha.net/img/kartta_b.jpg ) . 
  if it is any consolation we did n't always have silver ( or white ) and blue as our national colours . 
  gold ( or yellow ) and red are the colours of our coat of arms and for a very brief time we had flags that had them . 
  [ the state flag ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_finland_1918_%28state%29.svg ) and [ the merchant flag ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_lippu#/media/file:flag_of_finland_1918_%28merchant%29.svg ) . 
  but then civil war happened and the winner , the whites , could n't possibly use the colour of the reds , who lost the war . 
  maybe the continental way of writing numbers threw him off . 
  if i was the leader of the centre party i would insist that soini would take the post of the finance minister - the person who is responsible for the budget , with cuts , in the coming years . 
  [ that i kinda knew ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_ix_of_denmark#legacy ) . 
  thank you , did n't know that as i 'm not that well versed in dutch royalty . 
   again again ? 
  what !? 
  they have some kind of a sweatshop making pirated copies of statues ? 
  only to liberate it and that 's not stealing . 
  not only that but they also have [ an illegal copy of it in paris ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/paris-eiffel-liberty.jpg ) . 
   imo the true finns have already pretty much secured their place in the government . 
  not really - it all boils down how the negotiations for the coalition government goes . 
  if true finns set too strict preconditions for their participation in the coalition they 'll be out like last time . 
  they might have spoken french also . 
  is your version on time ? 
  olkiluoto was supposed to be finished by 2009 and now they think that it will be ready and producing electricity some time between 2018 and 2020 . 
  the president 's official website says that : the duties and authority of the president of the republic are enacted in the constitution of finland . 
  the president also has other statutory duties besides those specified in the constitution . 
  under the constitution of finland , executive power is vested in the president of the republic and the government . 
  the president of the republic leads finland 's foreign policy in co-operation with the government and decides on finland 's relations to foreign governments and actions in international organisations or negotiations . 
  the president of the republic is supreme commander of the finnish defence forces . 
  the president of the republic , who must be a native-born citizen of finland , is elected by direct popular vote for a term of six years . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.presidentti.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=44818&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-us ) edit : although the president leads finland 's foreign policy the eu matters are under the prime minister and the cabinet . 
  the president used to have more political power but in the current constitution those powers were transferred either to the government or the parliament .
