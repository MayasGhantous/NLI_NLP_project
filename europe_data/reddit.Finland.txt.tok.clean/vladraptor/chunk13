  personally i get 28 days of holiday in a year and we have up to 9 days of public holidays . 
  here is what the finnish occupational safety and health administration has to say about the holidays :  holidays  an employee has a right to receive pay also for the time he/she is on annual holiday . 
  normally holiday leave accumulates 2 days ( when employment has lasted less than 1 year ) or 2 1/2 days for each holiday credit month . 
  normal wages are paid for the time an employee is on holiday . 
  earned holiday leave can not be replaced with compensation pay unless the holiday can not be given due to the ending of the employment . 
  holiday compensation must also be paid if the worked hours do not entitle to holiday leave ( when working hours are under 35 h/month or working days under 14 days/month ) . 
   holiday compensation is 9-11 ,5 % , in the construction branch 18.5 % , of the accumulated wages during the holiday credit year , excluding raised pay for overtime or emergency work . 
   holiday compensation must be paid when the employment ends or , if so agreed , in addition to every monthly wage . 
  according to many collective agreements the employee also has a right to additional holiday money , which is usually a half of the holiday wages . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/workingfinland/ ) edit : forgot to mention that since it is the law this applies to the small businesses as well big ones . 
  usually small businesses either closes for the holiday period or more often employ temps for the summer , like students . 
  no , we had them in the past . 
  i once owned a [ prepaid card for a public payphone ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxsnsxn.jpg ) . 
  there were removed at the beginning of the 21st century for the lack of use . 
  if the distance between the school and home is longer than 5 kilometres then by law the municipality must provide free transportation . 
  in my case it was free ticket to the local bus line . 
  in rural areas where the public transport is not that good the municipality usually hire taxis to transport children between home and school . 
  mind you - not a taxi for every child but one for a group of children who live in the same area . 
  [ the kvarken archipelago ] ( http://www.kvarkenworldheritage.fi/visit-kvarken/ ) and if you mean those two dots near swedish-finnish border then i believe it 's [ the struve geodetic arc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/struve_geodetic_arc ) . 
  quiz over . 
  you scored 141 out of 141 . 
  your score is 100 %, 
  we bought 124 leopards from you in 2002 . 
  yes , the op probably did include finns that speak swedish and personally i think that 's a bit misleading . 
  about cheating , we do n't keep statistics of peoples ethnicity , only their country of birth and native language . 
  the former soviet union includes , for example , estonians that were born in estonia before the second independence of estonia . 
  you can , how ever , request the population registration centre to correct their information . 
  i had to check the data from the statistic finland and the largest group is persons from the former soviet union ( 53740 persons ) , next would be the estonians ( 39488 ) followed by the swedes ( 31777 ) . 
  figures are from 2013 . 
  i suppose i could think of some that make no sense in english , but `` en viitsi '' , 
  yes please !, 
  and i want the sequel : `` the return of the owl '', 
  historically swedes went to russia and danes to the british isles . 
  well someone has to ask : why on earth not ? 
  any possibility that the president would n't sign the law ? 
  can he even refuse to sign ? 
  yes , those are the hours of operation . 
  first set is for the monday through saturday and the second one is for the sunday . 
  it 's fairly common i guess , for example [ here ] ( https://laari.sok.fi/documents/11214/670377/prisma_laune.jpg/bdbbaef0-2e94-413a-968d-5fdb8fd0787a?t=1372674933295 ) and [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/k-citymarket_p%c3%a4iv%c3%b6l%c3%a4,_sein%c3%a4joki.jpg ) . 
  thank you for the answer . 
  on that example if i understood correctly ( my german is really , really rusty ) on the left the blue seats are reserved for the federal government but the seat on the right are for the federal council . 
  does the bundesrat sit with the bundestag ? 
  is it true what i 've heard that in stortinget your representatives ' seating arrangement is based on what part of the norway they are from and not by party ? 
  making * fins * feel awkward ... 
  i think we would just think that you are barking mad : `` why is that person talking to flippers '' . 
  it 's a general term for a strong distilled alcohol , especially clear ones that do n't have any added flavours . 
  thinking about who would sound posh in finnish matti klinge comes to my mind . 
  [ he sounds posh , at least to me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6x5hv2o7y0 ) . 
   however , they did n't create a mafia . 
  the original text reads `` mutta mafiaa he eiv\u00e4t saaneet aikaan '' and that can also be translated as `` but they were n't able/capable enough to form a mafia '' . 
  the text continues to explains how some of the finnish immigrants had bleak future . 
  so it 's also a bit self-deprecating . 
  just a coincidence . 
  it\u00e4 = east , valta = power , authority , reign . 
   but ... why ? 
  i 'm not that good in swedish but `` sant '' means `` true '' and `` sanning '' means `` truth '' but i do n't think that `` sann '' means anything . 
  i 'm sure that here is some swedes who can give you better explanation . 
  should n't that be `` det \u00e4r sant !, 
  [ the op linked this one to be the source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_europe ) and i ca n't find any reference that the law is pending and that there will be one more vote . 
   they still need to pass a bill that puts it into force . 
  not to my knowledge . 
  the law has passed and was signed by the president 25th of february 2015 . 
  however there are a number of other laws that has to be altered and that 's one reason why the new marriage law wo n't take effect until 2017 . 
  nah , norwegians are cool . 
  besides - all that oil money ... where can i roll out the red carpet ? 
  i think it is hej d\u00e5 which means bye . 
  what did he say ? 
  thank you , i actually do enjoy snow . 
  [ it makes everything look nice ] ( http://imgur.com/a/taw6u ) and cold does n't really bother me . 
  june , , july and august are considered to be summer months . 
  to be honest , the way he worded his post made me too think that he 's against the public tax records on principle . 
  i remember one case where some youth politician was saying that you should be fine living with a student grand that you receive from the government ( which is around 300 euros/month ) . 
  someone looked up her tax records and pointed out that she had an annual income of several hundred thousand euros . 
  it 's the thought that counts , right ? 
  well done !, 
  your score : 95 % 3:33 . 
  i mixed moldova and romania plus kosovo and bosnia-herzegovina .

  that reminded me of [ this scene ] ( https://youtu.be/mqrkkvq6ose?t=49s ) from qi . 
  thank you , i had a hunch that it might have something to do with the word ` v\u00e4kev\u00e4 ' but i did n't know that . 
  no i do , 
  i did n't know the other meaning for v\u00e5ld . 
  interestingly the finnish word for violence has the word ` power ' in it i.e. 
  honestly i do n't know the etymology of the word but we have a lot of old loan words from germanic languages so i would n't be surprised if it is too . 
  does n't ` v\u00e5ld ' mean violence nowadays ? 
  valta is also a synonym for valtio ( government , state ) , that 's why for example austria is it\u00e4valta ( east state/governement ) in finnish . 
  but valta usually refers to power as you said . 
  my employer pays my internet subscription but i checked what is available and here in [ kallio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kallio ) district of helsinki i could get : * a 100mbit/s vdls for 39,90 euros/month , * a 100mbit/s fibre for 39,90 euros/month or * a 200mbit/s fibre for 29,90 euros/month for fixed two year contract . 
  first two operators offer deals where the price is lower . 
  for the first one -50 % for the first six months . 
  the second operator offers 24 month contract where first year you pay 19,90 euros/month and on the second year 29,90 euros/month . 
  the third operator did n't offer any special deal but their regular price is already the cheapest . 
  i believe the maiden of finland is usually used in english . 
  my grandmother used to call it traktorihalli ( a tractor garage ) .
