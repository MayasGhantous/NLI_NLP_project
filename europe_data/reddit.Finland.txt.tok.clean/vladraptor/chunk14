  usually the government has two of the biggest parties and two to three smaller parties . 
  the one we have now is an exception that it has three of the biggest parties and no smaller ones . 
  all in all we have eight parties in our parliament . 
  it took time for to us to get used to coalition governments . 
  we 've been independent for 99 years and we have had 74 different governments . 
  especially prewar times where tumultuous and in 1922 we had our only political murder ( and last i hope ) . 
   the whole idea of the prime minister is literally just tradition . 
  what kind of role does the prime minister has ? 
  in finland we have almost always had a coalition government and because of that you could say that the one of the main jobs that the finnish prime minister has is to coordinate the wishes ( and sometimes demands ) of the coalition partners . 
  true , it is rare for a police officer to be killed in the line of duty . 
  all in all as the article says there has been 130 police deaths since the independence . 
  110 of those happened between 1917 and 1945 when we had prohibition ( 1919-1932 ) and we were at war ( 1918 , 1939 - 1940 and 1941 - 1945 ) . 
  thank you but i live in helsinki and [ the forecast here is n't that bad ] ( http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/weather/helsinki ) . 
  yes i 'm sure . 
  here in finland weather forecasts use metres/seconds when measuring wind speeds . 
  [ see for yourself ] ( http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/warnings ) , 
  actually that is the wind speed in metres in seconds . 
  [ finnish meteorological institute has a page ] ( http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/aallonkorkeus ) that shows the height of the waves . 
  edit : on that table : valitse havaintoasema = select the observation station merkitsev\u00e4 aallonkorkeus = significant wave height korkein yksitt\u00e4inen aalto = highest individual wave aallokon tulosuunta = direction of the waves pintaveden l\u00e4mp\u00f6tila = surface water temperature tuorein havainto = latest observation poijun sijainti = buoy location, 
   as for ownership i 'm not 100 % sure , either the government owns 100 % of it or is the majority shareholder . 
  when alko was founded in 1932 the law stated that you needed minimum of tree shareholders so the government owned all the shares except two , which were bought by two ministers at the time - one each . 
  the law changed few years ago and now the government owns the alko 100 % . 
  true , melody and stress is bit off and some consonants sound `` too '' soft to my ear . 
  if i remember correctly in mumin they mainly use helsingfors dialekt , also known as h\u00f6gsvenska . 
  it 's the one that i find easiest to understand as it was taught at school and i live in helsinki so it 's also most familiar sounding swedish dialect . 
  [ if not perfectly , then close ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4imjpdrtpo ) . 
  as you said the r is different also some vowel combinations are pronounced differently like ` eu ' . 
  a small detail if you do n't mind . 
  it 's left alliance , not leftist . 
  they lost kotka but they managed to keep kemi ( another of their strongholds ) . 
  but then again s/he 's talking about fins not finns ... , 
  since 1995 . 
  true , but i do n't think that they go to the police to be registered as residents and therefore are not counted as homeless on the official statistics . 
  our answer is to have [ the list of the candidates on the booth ] ( http://kuntalehti.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vaalit_aanestyskoppo.jpg ) and having [ a small ballot ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/tampere/article6340204.ece/alternates/w960/kunnallisvaalit+2012+vaalit+ennakko%c3%a4%c3%a4nestys+vaalilippu+kalevan+prisma+tampere.jpg ) on which you write your candidate 's number . 
  edit : formatting, 
  yes there is and it is 2 months before estimated time for the childbirth . 
  no it 's official regional language . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/minoritetsspr%c3%a5k_i_sverige#/media/file:officiella_minoritetsspr%c3%a5k.svg ) where you can see in which municipalities finnish , me\u00e4nkieli and sami languages are official minority languages . 
  but not an official language of the eu . 
  however i 'm curios why finnish was omitted from sweden . 
  it 's a official minority language there . 
  that was really interesting , thank you !, 
  a small corrections if you do n't mind . 
  `` imperial highness ' '' should be `` imperial majesty 's '' . 
  highness refers to a member of the imperial family who is a child of the emperor . 
  you 'll fill out a form where there ask this among other things like any illness you might have had . 
  before this date only same sex couples could enter in registered civil partnership . 
  now that gender neutral marriage law is in effect nobody can enter in a civil partnership . 
  if you currently live in a registered civil partnership you can ask the magistrate to change it to a marriage , but you do n't have to . 
  all the rules and regulations , benefits and restrictions concerning the registered civil partnership are still valid . 
  homosexuality itself is not an obstacle to donating blood but having sex between men is . 
  if you are a man and you have had sex with a man you can not donate blood for period of 12 months . 
  so technically no but practically yes , unless you live in celibacy . 
  i was thinking the same thing . 
  what 's next ? 
  a ban on kebab pizza ? 
  more sex ? 
  how did you come up with that conclusion ? 
  first one is . 
  the second one is from helsinki . 
  at least this one is also a parody of our own national image : number of lakes , m\u00e4mmi , winter war , how equal women are . 
  it 's not only a parody of trump . 
  [ icebucket , oh please ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qecjvsorto0 ), 
  there seems to be three finnish schools in the netherlands . 
  at least one of them , [ the lauantaikoulu , in rotterdam offers classes for adults ] ( http://www.lauantaikoulu.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=25&amp;itemid=30&amp;lang=nl ) . 
  often they do n't bother and you see swedish , finnish and common danish/norwegian text . 
  packages do n't have separated text for danish and norwegian , only separate words . 
  for example like [ here ] ( http://www.xn--mttmestari-q5a2t.fi/kuvat/sodastream-xstream-energy-tuoteseloste.jpg ) . 
  edit : [ slightly more clearer example at the very top of the picture ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zcddg4rzdgg/wdyhjqo_ypi/aaaaaaaaaua/85mgbkvpghcrsqzo07anyxpvnw48vzvzwclcb/s1600/img_20161120_120534.jpg ) . 
  if i remember correctly it 's considered to be a carcinogenic and that 's why it has a ban but sweden has a special permission to manufacture and sell snus . 
  permission they negotiated when entering the eu . 
  legally no you can not . 
  that 's why people import it from sweden and you can only import 1000 grams within 24h . 
  is n't it illegal to sell snus in the eu , except in sweden ? 
  but i thought that since those countries are still in the eu they can not have a special deal with the uk . 
  and you just had to say that out loud ? 
  now he 's not going touch turku even with a ten feet pole . 
  i think it 's actually scania ( sk\u00e5ne ) flag and he just changed the flair text to finland . 
   can you really drive out there in the winter ? 
  [ you used to be able to ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/timoheinonen/11888423546 ) , but i do n't remember there being a ice road to suomenlinna in resent times , partly because the sea does n't freeze over or the ice is not thick enough . 
  also there might be a shipping lane that [ cuts the route they used ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/timoheinonen/11888025614/in/photostream/ ) but i 'm not sure . 
  i do n't think it 's from berlin , i 've never heard of a berlin suspension railway . 
  actually they could by not exporting gas , petrol and oil , but that would hurt russia too and badly . 
  [ semi-soft cow 's milk cheese ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7crqy492tps/vpgnpxtugai/aaaaaaaahls/i5ulamsyfra/s1600/p1259233.jpg ) , which has a slight buttery taste . 
  part of the problem is not the electoral college itself but the winner-takes-all voting system where the candidate that has most votes also takes all the electors . 
  we had electoral college for our presidential elections but the electors were elected by proportional voting . 
  it is unfortunate , because with the orange stripe it would make your flag a unique one . 
  edit : not solely because of the colour orange , because there are other countries that have orange in their flag like ireland , but being a orange , white , blue tricolour . 
  well that sucks !, 
  [ indeed , fins rarely care ... ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47919000/jpg/_47919266_smoothy.jpg ), 
  f\u00f6r all del , but i do n't think that \u00e5l\u00e4ndarna want come back anymore , but thanks to the marvellous nordic passport union you are free to visit anytime . 
  how about the one with orange stripe instead of red one ? 
  i think it looks nice . 
  are n't belgium and austria federations as well ? 
  then there are denmark and finland that are not federations but have parts that have autonomy .

  i 'm curious why you separated faeroes and greenland but not \u00c5land ? 
  that 's why the fuss about trump 's taxes seems so strange .
