  here the reporters would march to the tax office and requested to see them . 
  well , they would n't actually have to go to the tax office . 
  media can have their information electronically for journalistic purposes . 
  our newspapers and tabloids especially publish lists when the tax office makes them public in the november . 
  for the same reason in our company coffee makers and tea kettles were banned , but it 's a bizarre rule that you can use a coffee maker to heat water but not make coffee . 
  at least in our company those were collected away and we have coffee machines , where you can get free coffee . 
  from stockholm to helsinki you need to take a ferry ( or a plane ) but from [ helsinki to st petersburg you can travel by train ] ( https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/en/tickets_to_russia ) , [ a link to the swedish pages if you find them more convenient ] ( https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/sv/tagbiljetter_till_ryssland ) . 
  not sure if there is a train connection from st petersburg to tallinn . 
  there is a buss and train connection from haparanda-tornio to helsinki but i 'm not sure if you can get to haparanda from stockholm , if you wish to take the long route to helsinki . 
  unfortunately there was a dos attack on the vr.fi web-shop earlier this month and you can not use it outside of finland to buy tickets at the moment . 
  actually we are connected to sweden [ in haparanda and tornio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torne_river_railway_bridge ) . 
  and no , you can not take a train from helsinki to tallinn . 
  there is a preliminary project to investigate feasibility of a railway tunnel between tallinn and helsinki . 
  winter wear tends to be a bit bulky and it keeps sliding off from your lap , plus you 'll get hot . 
  and since it is going to be hot in the restaurant car , people would take their outer clothes off and there is no place to but them other than seat next to you etc. 
  does this mean that sweden can take back the [ swedish pomerania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_pomerania ) ? 
  but is n't your sole reason for existing to be in the middle , like a buffer ? 
  no worries , i did guess from the context what it might be but i have never seen that word before . 
  on the article it says that after the incident the man gave the bear some pieces of ham . 
  i do n't think that 's the best way keeping bears away from your trash . 
  that is a bit extreme example and it is extreme because it is a name invented by bureaucrats for a type of public institution . 
  do n't dutch do compound words ? 
  there are many old loan words from swedish that has `` transformed '' to better suite finnish pronunciation and grammar . 
  unfortunately , or maybe fortunately , i had injured my leg before and it was still too sore for all those steps . 
  one look at them and i was : `` no way in hell am i going to climb those '' . 
  i stayed on the wooden platform build on the ridge . 
  that 's m\u00f8ns klint , is it not ? 
  no , you did not miss a coup . 
  couple of years ago the parliament modernised their voting system and they used conscripts to test it . 
   this is a pet peeve i can see that it is . 
  i am aware of the difference - i just did n't bother to go into so much details just to point out that we have to official national languages and because of that institutions ( usually ) have names in both of them . 
  like in belgium the finnish parliament officially has two names in both national language : [ eduskunta in finnish and riksdagen in swedish ] ( https://www.eduskunta.fi/en/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  no worries !, 
  i 'll pin your brain fart on sweden . 
  do n't quite know how yet but i 'll come up something . 
  sweden ... :'(, 
  there are [ two spanish cities ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/mapa_del_sur_de_espa%c3%b1a_neutral.png ) in north africa : ceuta and melilla . 
  i wonder what the third dot would be , [ that one peninsula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plazas_de_soberan%c3%ada#/media/file:velez_de_la_gomera.jpg ) perhaps . 
  interesting , i did n't know that . 
  i believe it was n't really a thing before the old [ euro coins ] ( http://static.hudo.com/images/posters/2813/image.jpg ) . 
  it was fixed on [ the new ones ] ( https://positivetherapy.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/german-2-euro-coins-31.jpg ) . 
  so parasol would be what we call a ' [ aurinkovarjo ' ] ( https://kotijapuutarha.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/aurinkovarjo-musta.jpg ) , which literally translates as a sun shade/shadow . 
  handheld ones are called a [ ` p\u00e4iv\u00e4nvarjo ' ] ( http://www.haaparatiisi.fi/webroot/vilkasfi02/shops/2015061704/581f/5d43/1164/d844/170f/0a28/100b/b893/paeivaenvarjo.png ) , a day shade . 
  and an umbrella is ` sateenvarjo ' , a rain shade . 
  why would you think so ? 
  i thought that frankfurt am is the financial centre of germany ? 
  that sounds terrible !, 
  private homes rarely have ac , so when it does get hot it is also hot inside . 
  trying to sleep in 25c is hard , especially when you are not used to it . 
  usually it 's 21c except in bedroom where it should be 19c . 
  these are recommendations , what temperatures people have varies quite a lot . 
  we are looking at unseasonably cold summer so far . 
  right now it 's 10 degrees celsius in helsinki . 
  op is being sarcastic . 
  it has been unseasonably cold spring and summer so far . 
  yes , those are pods of peas . 
  and people do buy peas and eat them as snacks , but they are a seasonal food and eaten from the pods in the summer . 
  it 's nice , do n't get me wrong . 
  i just never thought it to be especially note worthy . 
  i never thought it to be really good . 
  it 's nice and although the [ finlandia hymn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3jj0vdln-u ) is nicer , i would n't want to change the one that we have now to it , which has been proposed . 
  edit : links are hard, 
   have a really good anthem we do ? 
   '' have a weird obsession with salty liquorice i thought that germans shared that obsession . 
  he saw first hand what a too powerful president can mean . 
  i 'm not entirely sure if this is a urban myth but when he was a prime minister and had a difference in opinions with the then president kekkonen , he had to remind kekkonen that it is the parliament that has the power to dismiss him and the government , not the president . 
  kekkonen was notorious in using not only his constitutional powers but also his influence in finnish politics . 
  not necessarily , not that i wish him dead , but he is 79 years old and past the average life expectancy for males in finland . 
  playing football in the smell of drying cod . 
  it looks like they have cod drying racks next to the football pitch . 
  true , but no longer . 
  so victoria will be kuningatar ( queen ) victoria , not viktoria . 
  out of curiosity : you did know that letter is \u00df and not b ? 
  it 's a portrait of a florentine lady painted in florence . 
  i was wondering how uniquely finnish christmas tradition is visiting a cemetery . 
  here we usually go and light a candle or candles on the graves of the dead love ones on christmas eve as a remembrance . 
  if i remember correctly this tradition started during wwii . 
  is there a similar tradition elsewhere in europe ? 
  [ here is a picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/286bzfr.jpg ) from the cemetery near my parent 's house . 
  [ there is also a place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/80vvj5t.jpg ) where you can leave a candle for those who are buried elsewhere . 
  and for those who find that to be somewhat morbid [ a picture a took this evening ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g6ibtso.jpg ) - we did get a white christmas after all and a picture of my parent 's [ joulukuusi , or christmas tree ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l3toyog.jpg ) with flags , a custom that is danish one originally if i 'm not wrong . 
  there 's sukulaissielu which would translate as kindred spirit . 
  [ finland had worlds first female mps in 1907 ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/5922616/landscape16_9/768/433/6da3f7d9614668eca59915df018c1c47/mg/naiskansanedustajat.jpg ) . 
  also i find the lack of civil society and the russian state 's aspiration to suppress what little there is left worrisome . 
  [ west coast ] ( http://www.discoveringfinland.com/west-coast/ ) , small towns and villages , farms , swedish speaking people . 
  thai fried rice , khao pad . 
  yes , on the upper part of the korean peninsula , neighbouring china , russia and south korea . 
  [ by 2020 counties should get more responsibilities transferred from the municipalities and the central government . 
  ] ( http://alueuudistus.fi/en/reform-of-regional-administration ), 
  they are not lockable , or more accurately the locking system has been disabled . 
  danish highways seemed nice . 
  a friend of mine and i rented a car and drove from copenhagen to west coast of jutland and back . 
  there were two things that we found a bit unusual : the lack of signs for speed limits , you seemed to have less than we do and no street lights at on or off ramps . 
  here the highways outside of urban areas are not lit but the [ ramps are ] ( http://www.vastavalo.net/albums/userpics/11625/normal_20120909-_u9i3794jv.jpg ) . 
  i live in helsinki , which was traditionally a swedish speaking area and finnish did n't become the dominant language until beginning of the 20th century . 
  in finnish speaking areas some few dozen kilometres inland they spoke tavastian dialects which are close to the standard finnish . 
  you dream being stabbed by a drunk mute ? 
  you have very peculiar dreams ... 
  tyrkisk pebers are nice but you have to blame danes for those . 
  they are a danish invention .
