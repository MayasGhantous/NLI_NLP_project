  but people in good faith might come to a conclusion that person x is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , when in fact later it turns out that there was reasonable doubt . 
  cameron todd willingham case comes to my mind . 
  we are not all mute drunks that stab people with our puukkos . 
  are n't there numerous cases in your justice system were there was a great pressure to get a conviction , not to search for the truth ? 
  i probably should have pointed out that i do n't think that german is especially harsh language . 
  i just do n't see it as a very soft one either . 
  it goes against the finnish mentality for your mother to be proud of you . 
  less disappointed maybe ... 
  no , it 's correct . 
  he has a very nice and soft voice but i do n't still think that german sounds soft because all those consonants and consonant clusters that you have . 
  i like the way dutch sounds . 
  not necessarily a beautiful language but interesting one . 
  also some swedish dialects sound nice . 
  estonian sounds a cuter version of a southwestern dialect spoken in finland . 
  there is the nordic cross flag with yellow cross on red background . 
  it takes it 's colours from our [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/coat_of_arms_of_finland.svg ) and it was considered as our national flag , but the current blue cross on white was more popular , and it fell out of favour when the soviet union adopted a flag with same colours . 
  also it was associated with the swedish speaking finns and it still is their [ unofficial flag . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/5/5e/brevmarke.jpg ) people usually do n't recognise it or they think that it as the flag of scania , which is similar . 
  so that 's * the * reason behind the brexit ... 
  here on they day when the lion of the north died in battle , we celebrate the finnish swedish heritage day ( svenska dagen / ruotsalaisuuden p\u00e4iv\u00e4 ) but i 'm doubtful that many make the connection . 
  other than that kustaa ii aadolf , as his name is written in finnish , is just a historical figure . 
  mass effect series , elite dangerous , alan wake , deus ex : human revolution . 
  kullannuppu is one which , if translated word to word , means a bud of gold , i.e. 
  darling , sweetie , etc.

  they did n't get a citizenship but the permanent residence : `` returnees from areas of the former soviet union you can obtain a residence permit on the basis of remigration if you originate in the area of the former soviet union and * you are an ingrian finn and were relocated to finland during the second world war from 1943 to 1944 and later returned to the soviet union or * you served in the finnish army during the second world war from 1939 to 1945 you need no proof of means of support . '', 
  the law was changed last year and no-longer can you get a permanent permission to live in finland simply by being a ingrian finn . 
  our post ` posti ' has had its share of problems lately . 
  last week they informed that they wo n't deliver letters on tuesdays any more . 
  also in the winter , when they had serious problems with missing posts , there was a joke circulating : `` what is the best way of making a body to disappear ? 
  send it by post '' . 
  i have used myself on numerous occasions when i was in a cafe with friends and no alcohol was consumed . 
  if one of your parents is finnish then you can have a finnish citizenship . 
  if you have finnish grandparents , then you may apply for permanent residence but not citizenship . 
  [ you can find more information on finnish citizenship from the finnish immigration services ] ( http://www.migri.fi/finnish_citizenship ) . 
  as far as i know there is no pan-european credit database so in a foreign country you do n't have a credit history . 
  basically it 's up to the lender if they wish to give you a loan or not . 
  in theory yes , but in practise you probably wont get a loan from other country . 
  [ `` you can in principle also obtain a mortgage loan from lenders based in other eu countries ; however , your country of residence , where you work or the location of the property may influence how the lender assesses your application .

  with a bad voice actor translating what the character is saying you do know that it 's called dubbing ? 
  we do n't do that except in children 's programmes and some documentaries . 
  we have three public tv-channels and two big and several smaller private ones . 
  in a very rough division the public ones show more documentaries and domestic or european drama , and the private ones show more entertainment and american shows . 
  you do n't have to declare war on vatican , just go protestant . 
  you might get yourself a 30 year war , plus ireland going protestant ... ... might be a bit problematic ... 
  i know of it but i have never heard anyone say it .

  i grew up in an area that looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.4915355,25.0985154,3a,75y,129.27h,104.43t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sby5qwpiszicmf31q6utbdw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and now i live in an area that looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.1859106,24.9532475,3a,75y,359.4h,88.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s49t2-qf3ltp9njgukfbf-a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  there is the `` skool '' , which comes from swedish `` sk\u00e5l '' . 
  the other finnish word that is used is `` kippis '' , but to be honest in my extended family we never said `` kippis '' . 
  i did n't even know about it until i was an adult . 
  the act is called `` skoolaminen '' or `` maljan nosto '' / `` nostaa malja '' , which translates as raising the cup/chalice . 
  there probably are others , but those are the ones that i 'm familiar with . 
  i tried to translate the finnish sentence ( and failed i can see ) . 
  what it means is that the unit is 1000 trips , so to estonia finns made 2.39 million visits , but i changed it . 
  according to the statistics finland the top 5 countries in 2016 were : * viro ( estonia ) 2 390 000 * ruotsi ( sweden ) 1 690 000 * espanja ( spain ) 740 000 ( inc. . canary islands 320 000 ) . 
  * ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ( russia ) 460 000 * saksa ( germany ) 280 000 edit : a small change how the figures were presented . 
  does that label at the upper corner say `` kiitos kun rakastat viron ( virolaista ? ), 
  i 've heard from people who has spend time in the usa that over there it is not customary offer something to visitors . 
  you might get a glass of water if you ask for it . 
  here it is good manners to offer some coffee and coffee bread ( pulla ) . 
  that is weird . 
  here you can not legally refuse a trip because you want to do a more profitable one . 
  but during cold war you were . 
  did n't you for example have fourth largest air force at the time ? 
  maybe op is remembering that time . 
  i only heard about it this spring from a news article . 
  i did a quick search and found [ this page were it is mentioned on the last paragraph ] ( http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/view-103684-sverigefinland ) and [ on this one it is mentioned about halfway through and it goes more in detail ] ( http://www.svensktidskrift.se/litteratur-boheman-om-kriget/ ) . 
  i 'm not that good in swedish , so you 'll probably will find it easier to find more sources in swedish . 
  fanta mandarin is nice but i think it 's sold only in 1.5 litre bottles . 
  our castles are museums nowadays so you would have to buy an entrance ticket and i would imagine that it would be odd to larp among other visitors . 
  it was an odd and not very good joke . 
  it 's especially awkward one when ( if ) you know that persians and arabs do n't always have the best of relationships . 
   `` how do you say cheers in persian ? 
  please say he was trying to be funny , not being serious ... 
  no , not to my knowledge . 
  maybe in the rural area were people know each other more intimately , but not in small towns and in cities were i have lived nobody came to visit and brought food with them . 
   something like 99 % of the finnish population was evacuated in the moscow peace treaty there was no stipulation that finland had to evacuate the current population but as clebekki wrote almost none wished to stay , as a result we had to resettle 430 000 people which was quite a feat for a poor country with a population of 3 586 000 persons . 
  in hindsight if people would have stayed they probably would have been transferred other parts of the soviet union . 
  fun fact : during interim peace in 1940 there were talks for a union between finland and sweden but swedish government placed a condition that both the nazi germany and the soviet union must approve it , which they did n't and thus we never became one . 
  we do n't call them tornadoes , we call them a ` trombi ' and there are on estimate 14 siting a year . 
  strongest recorded one was f4 . 
  [ here is an example of a trombi ] ( https://www.taivaanvahti.fi/observations/show/22534 ) . 
  did n't they have some terrorist movement earlier ? 
  i enjoy reading science fiction and not a lot of it is translated to finnish so i started to read them in english . 
  most non-english works that i 've read have been finnish translations ( like novels of stanislaw lem ) , but if the original is in english , then i 'll read them in the original language . 
  i 've also have tried to read novels in swedish but my proficiency in swedish is n't at the level that i can read them without a dictionary . 
  positive thing about reading literature in foreign language is that you 'll develop broader ( passive ) vocabulary . 
  i had a rule that if i have no idea what is written because i can not understand a word , or if the word comes up third time , i 'll look it up from the dictionary . 
  i have a feeling that there was a mix up and somewhere in ireland there is a short stretch of motorway that has a 10km/h speedlimit ... 
  i would like to have carrols back - they had the best burgers ^ * - but unfortunately even you do n't have them anymore . 
  ^ * a ^ perception ^ that ^ might ^ be ^ clouded ^ by ^ nostalgia . 
  if someone really wanted to learn finnish then good luck - not the easiest language to learn if you are a native english speaker . 
  and if you wish to visit the old country then go for it !, 
  americans just seem to go a bit overboard . 
  a tattoo of a random finnish word or sentence to feel more connected . 
  claiming that your character traits are what they are because a percentage of your heritage is finnish . 
  not very popular .
