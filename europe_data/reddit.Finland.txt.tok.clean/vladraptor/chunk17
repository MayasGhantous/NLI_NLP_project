  finnish federation of the brewing and soft drinks industry 's statistics gives these figures . 
  in the finnish version term ` mineral water ' is used instead of ` packaged water ' .

  not really if their job is to be a head of state instead of a head of government . 
  logic behind it is that you might be elected as a candidate of a party , but the office of the president is to represent the whole country and its people not just your own party . 
  here the presidents do n't have to give up his or her party membership , but by tradition they do as symbolic gesture that they are now above or neutral concerning normal daily politics . 
  all the others are unknown to me . 
  helsinki too and born in j\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 . 
  just out of curiosity - where are you from ? 
  i do n't remember hearing any of those and i was wondering it that is a regional thing ... ... or i do n't recognise them because the translation . 
  is it known why this happened ? 
  it depends on what part of the country you are and how religious or irreligious people there are , but for the most part i would say that people are indifferent about them . 
  one thing that you should note is that we have two national churches , the evangelical lutheran church of finland and the finnish orthodox church , and if you are a priest in one of those then you are a civil servant and the church law defines the duties of the priest . 
  i would say that not so long ago priest were n't just spiritual leaders but also an extension of the state . 
  edit : i forgot to add that there are religious organisations beyond the national church and there the priests have more say on daily life and are more revered . 
  all honesty i do n't know where she was , but her side of the family is from tavastia proper ( kanta-h\u00e4me ) , so i 'm doubtful that she was in piikki\u00f6 . 
  it seems an interesting game . 
  in a nation that drinks most coffee per capita , i drink none , so i would say that this makes me an outsider . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  i thought it would be some sort of a fleet game , human fleet versus cylon fleet . 
  when you say no one knows who is a cylons that can not mean the player who is playing as a cylon ? 
  but is n't that more of a german thing ? 
  here at least if you ask for water in a restaurant you 'll get tap water . 
  you 'll have to ask especially for a mineral water if that is what you want . 
  i never meat my great-grandmother because she died before i was born but my grandmother told that her mother told her how she was a maid ( piika ) in a farm were the family had fled and how she had to crawl to the barn to milk the cows because there was fighting nearby and shots were fired . 
   battlestar galactica what 's the goal in that game ? 
  find earth , destroy the fleet ? 
  what gave you the impression that we do n't drink tap water ? 
  at least in finland around 89 % of people have blue or grey eyes and if you have brown eyes you usually have a brown hair too . 
  i do n't remember ever seeing a blond with brown eyes , but i have n't actually trying to find one either . 
  i saw that map before but i thought it was a county ( maakond in estonian ? ), 
  reform , no municipality . 
  you are going to get geographically big municipalities . 
  thank you !, 
  here you need a valid reason for firing someone and if the worker suspects that the termination of employment was n't legal he or she will take it to his or hers labour union that will sue the company on behalf of its member ( if they think that there is a change of winning ) . 
  we have a special court for labour issues , the [ labour court of finland ] ( http://tyotuomioistuin.fi/en/index.html ) . 
  however they only take matters concerning [ collective agreements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_agreement ) and situations were either one has broken the law . 
  cases that concerns individual agreements between employee and employer go through normal courts . . for example if you were promised extra holidays , more than those which has been collectively agreed , when you signed your contract and you did n't get them , is a matter that does not go to the labour court . 
  do you have to give a reason for firing someone ? 
  i mean , how can you tell that you fired someone because they were gay , black or women if no reason for firing is required ? 
  sam neill sounds english at times . 
  is that typical for the educated nz accent ? 
  i think that the op meant firing a person not laying off workers , which can be easy if you follow proper procedures . 
  if someone really does n't have anything better to do , the reasons when you can fire a person can be found from the [ employment contracts act ] ( http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2001/20010055 ) . 
  the ultimate trojan horse ? 
  really ? 
  i 've never thought the nordics being excessively concerned with material possessions . 
  i would say that money is seen as a means to a goal , not the end goal itself . 
  also we are quite secular and practical orientated societies , which might give an impression that material wealth is all that interests us . 
  but then again , i myself might be blind to this as i am a product of this culture . 
  they are ? 
  i 've never heard such of thing , but if you say so . 
  i 'm no expert on spiritualism . 
  i do n't know if there are reliable statistics but yes , we do have a lot of blonde haired people with varying shades of blondness . 
  we also have a lot of blue eyed people . 
  89 % finns have blue of grey eyes . 
  do n't know about the height , but if you [ prefer blondes , we got you covered ] ( http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/214-the-blonde-map-of-europe ) . 
  well ... no i feel offended on behalf of our swedish speaking finns !, 
  ^ p.s. 
  ^ i ^ hope ^ that ^ you ^ realise ^ that ^ i ^ was ^ joking ? 
  37m ^ 2 with a bedroom and a living room that has an integrated kitchen area . 
  it 's ok - would n't mind having more space and a separate kitchen , but i do n't have money to buy larger one from inner city and i do n't want to live in the suburbs . 
  i live alone . 
  so you just had to drop one of the nordic countries off your list ... 
  thank you !, 
   it came from one of our tv channels ' youtube channels yes , i noticed that and thought that was the reason why it was blocked . 
  i 've heard swenglish before so i am somewhat familiar what it sounds like . 
  also : `` niv\u00e5 '' , it 's funny when people use their native terms , sometimes thinking that it 's an universal term , 
  on a * very broad * sense i can tell if it is scottish , irish , welsh or northern english vs. rest of english dialect or if it is some american , canadian or australian/new zealander that is talking . 
  i have trouble telling the difference between australians and new zealanders . 
  i can usually tell the difference if person is speaking a southern finnish swedish or ostrobothnian swedish . 
  also swedish spoken in sk\u00e5ne is quite distinctive . 
  very common but we are very good at putting them out and they usually never spread very far .

  my mother 's cousin did some genealogy research and got to the late 1600 's on my mother 's father 's side and early 1800 's on my mother 's mother 's side . 
  [ sliced beats ] ( https://www.kauppahalli24.fi/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/400x/602f0fa2c1f0d1ba5e241f914e856ff9/6/4/6424908512207.1489827115.jpg ) and [ mustard cucumber salad ] ( http://www.felix.fi/tuotteet/kurkkusalaatit/felix+sinappikurkkusalaatti+390+g ) . 
  no , officially it has not been the reason . 
  finland has vetoed both romania 's and bulgaria 's membership and the reason behind it has been that both countries have big problems with corruption and both countries have not done enough to battle it and develop their justice system , despite both of them giving assurances that they will . 
  i 'm paraphrasing our politicians , not expressing personal opinion , i do n't know enough to give one . 
  no , but on some issue we sided with britain , the netherlands and/or sweden and could influence that ways . 
  on others we sided with germany . 
  coming from a small country our politician usually are aware of our limited influence on different matters . 
  bad luck and you are supposed to perform a small ritual involving spitting and/or salt , or something like that to ward off the bad luck . 
  edit : i had to check it out and you are supposed to spit over your shoulder . 
  when euro was introduced you could buy from kiosks a collections of finnish euro coins , one coin of each value , and it contained the one and two euro cent coins . 
  the price was the value of the coins in the collection . 
  idea was that you could familiarise yourself with the new coins but they became a collectors item quite quickly . 
  i opened mine so it lost it 's `` extra '' value . 
  i would concur that ` sekaroituinen ' is worse than ` mulatti ' . 
  i only remember ` mulatti ' used in school on a geography classes , and it was just a descriptive term for an offspring of a white and black parents . 
  i went to school in the 80 's . 
  i remember reading a book from a briton who has done culture studies and on that book he wrote that of the nordics danes are the only ones who do not think that europe or continent is somewhere else . 
  and not really an option nowadays either . 
  you 'll need a visa to go to russia and it 's far less hassle to take a ferry to sweden or estonia . 
  we use it too sometimes , the continent that is , but before the \u00d6resund bridge the only way to get to the `` continent '' was go over water by a ship . 
  so not an island you still do have to take a ferry if you wish to drive from finland to the rest of the europe . 
  unless you go through norther sweden , but that would be odd ... 
  the word continental usually refers to the culture and customs , not people .
