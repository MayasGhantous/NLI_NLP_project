  it is and shops sell [ these horseshoe shaped tins ] ( https://img.yle.fi/ylex/kuva-arkisto/article8562948.ece/alternates/w960/uudenvuoden%20tina%20uusivuosi%20vuodenvaihde ) and shallow ladles just before the new year . 
  it is broadcasted every new years eve , so yes it 's popular . 
  are there any other version than the one where there is the german intro where they explain the story ? 
  that 's the one that is shown here . 
  one thing that i find strange is that you have election on a weekday which is not a national holiday . 
  our elections are on sunday and before the actual election day there is a period when you can vote in advance . 
  no irregular verbs like we do n't have in finnish ?

  ehem ... we have a law from year 2000 that stipulates that all prices have to be rounded up or down to the nearest five cents . 
  also shops do n't have to accept one and two euro cent coins if they do not want to . 
  neekeri , for example , was n't originally a racist word but it became one so mulatti might have become one as well . 
  i think that a better translation for ` neekeri ' is negro . 
  i would translate ` nekru ' as nigger . 
  i do n't think it is , but then again you rarely hear anyone using that word . 
  i see , i can understand that it can be a hassle if nobody can write or say your name correctly , but maybe you should have heeded to their advise !, 
  imagine how cool it would be if you would be a bygg6 soldat or bygg6 krigare !, 
  why do you hate your surname , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  mine is a bit inconvenient at times because it has letter ' \u00e4 ' , but i do n't really hate it . 
  there are roughly 6000 people who share my surname . 
  my mother 's surname is used only in that family so it 's rare name . 
  [ the finnish population centre offers a search engine for finnish names ] ( https://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/nimipalvelu/default.asp?l=3 ) , that will tell you the popularity . 
  for a reference the name korhonen is the most popular surname in finland and 23144 persons have it . 
  quite common . 
  2015 there were 2 656 000 households in finland and in 2016 they had 502 900 `` kes\u00e4m\u00f6kki / sommarstuga `` s , ( which translates as summer cottage ) . 
  i could n't find the number of households in 2016 but i doubt that there has been a drastic change from 2015 . 
  it 's not totally uncommon to have `` american cousins '' , but not so common that you could say that every family has one . 
  i personally no two families who have relatives in the usa . 
  it is far more common to have relatives that emigrated to sweden in the 1960 's and 1970 's . 
  i found a one article from 2016 where it said that netflix has nearly a million weekly audience and that the streaming service ( yle areena ) of the finnish broadcasting corporation is the most popular one . 
  the most popular programme in yle areena to date has been the norwegian teen series skam , which has had around a quarter of a million views per episode . 
  streaming services are on the rise but i did n't find any other figures than the netflix one . 
  in finland you can get streaming services from our local tv-stations , netflix and hbo nordic . 
  maybe others but i 'm not sure . 
   if that 's what you like well ... as a child i did n't have that much say  when i moved on my own i must say that i have slipped . 
  and it was a ton of work but protestant work ethics makes you do things , because there is no honor for the lazy . 
  the routine that i was taught at home was : collect the rugs and put them outside so that they can air and smell fresh . 
  hoover the floors . 
  put water and floor cleaning agent into a bucket and swipe the floors with a [ sinipiika ] ( https://res.cloudinary.com/tokmanni/image/upload/w_1000,h_1033,c_pad,b_white,f_auto/d_default.png/6423800311017.jpg ) . 
  beat the rugs and place them back on the floors . 
  we did n't have that many rugs , couple in kitchen , also couple in the hallway , one big one in the living room and smaller ones in bedrooms . 
  all together 8 to 10 rugs . 
  this we did every friday after school . 
  if you wish to be informal you say ` hei ' or ` moi ' . 
  ` good day ' and ` day ' would both be formal , latter one less so . 
  sorry , i somehow managed to miss the sarcasm . 
  [ rye bread ] ( https://a.mktgcdn.com/p/cz49xy0c76r7k-i79fcdgvqqxo7f4krnjo8n4gubv-i/357x434.jpg ) with a slices of ham , lettuce , tomato , [ sweet pepper ] ( https://www.kauppahalli24.fi/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/a/paprika_1_2.1496671105.jpg ) and an egg . 
  some tea to go with it . 
  because i was brought-up in a culture where it would be considered impolite not to tell if the other asks how you are - hence , you do not ask how they are if you are not interested their well being . 
  if i greet someone with a phrase : ` hei , mit\u00e4 kuuluu ? ', 
  ( hey , how are you ) , i will expect them to answer how they are . 
  edit : naturally i use this with people i already know . 
  if i do n't want to know how they are , i 'll just say ` hei ' or ` moi ' , perhaps ` p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 ' if it is semi-formal situation or ` hyv\u00e4\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 ' if it is a formal situation . 
  hyv\u00e4\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 means literally good day . 
  we use rugs , with the idea that you can beat them outside and wipe the floors with a damp cloth or a mop . 
  the beating will get rid off dust better than just hoovering , as does the wiping of the floors . 
  in finland i believe that shops do have a legal right to add the costs of card payments to the customer 's bill but none do to my knowledge . 
  and there usually are no limits how small amount you can pay by card . 
  on the contrary , you can see signs that say that the shop does not accept notes above 50 euro value . 
  nope , in finland we have , by law , product information in finnish and swedish . 
  so when i was in sweden i assumed that you too would have them in both languages . 
  as it turned out - you do n't . 
  i believe her point was that you do n't do the finnish thing and start telling people how you are , 
  and one of the few thing that i do remember from my french classes is , that the only appropriate answer is : ca va bien . 
  i was visiting a relative in sweden somewhere near gothenburg and i was baffled by the fact that none of the products had any finnish on them . 
  i remember turning a milk carton in my hands trying to find the finnish text . 
  i was so used to having text both in finnish and swedish . 
  i find it odd that they do n't always seem to understand differences between monarchies . 
  no european monarchy is an absolute monarchy , but sometimes when you read the comments , it is as if some americans do n't know the difference between denmark and brunei . 
  for some reason we have quite a number of different animal species as national animal , like [ national horse breed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnhorse ) , [ national butterfly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holly_blue ) , [ national fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_perch ) etc. 
  people usually remember our national bird , which is whooper swan and national animal , which is bear . 
  but i must say that i personally associate bear with russia , not finland . 
  i think they were but to be honest i 'm not sure . 
  i do remember that a smaller shop that sold snuss had text in finnish , but i 'm not sure about a large ica if they had or not . 
  i do wonder how they came up a roll with a pizza stuffing from the original one . 
  pizza ? 
  i 've known couple but not very well and they all came to finland because their spouses were from here . 
  i do n't really think about american expats , other than you can usually spot relatively resent expat for being quite loud . 
  if i remember correctly you do n't even have to annex it , just assassinate the ruling family and monaco will be french . 
  ` puhua ' , to speak . 
  ` puhaltaa ' , to blow air . 
  ` puhuri ' , a gust of wind . 
  edit : i did n't know that , 
  it * seems * so because you use some old common words , like ` suvi ' for ` kes\u00e4 ' ( summer ) that we do n't anymore , that and the fact that you use german loan words , like telefo , that we have replaced with native words makes estonian give the impression that you are reading an older finnish text . 
  i know that in reality it is finnish that uses more old words . 
  i 've also heard that because of this it is easier for estonians to understand finnish than finns to understand estonian . 
  i usually get a broad idea what is said or written . 
  estonian seems as if it is an odd mixture of old finnish , german and totally unrecognisable words . 
  the unfamiliar words usually are native estonian words , like [ ` ait\u00e4h ' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ait%c3%a4h ) , which in finnish is ` kiitos ' . 
  also there are words that you recognise but have a somewhat different meaning in finnish , like the word for milk in estonian means sour milk in finnish . 
  but are n't some norwegian dialects a bit hard to understand even for norwegians ? 
  could that be reason why they would speak english ? 
  i was visiting haaparanta in sweden , or haparanda as it is known in swedish , last summer and at least there almost all people working in shops spoke finnish . 
  i only remember one lady who did n't speak finnish but clearly understood it . 
  i do n't know witch one is the best as i do n't hike , but there is a site for finnish national parks where you can get more information : http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/welcome . . 
  i would imagine they are . 
  it was just an example to what lengths some of you americans can go . 
   after voting the first time last year , i was pestered by my father about who i voted for but that 's a breach of the secrecy of the ballot . 
  my parents have never demanded to know who i voted for , and if they did , they would get a very stern lecture about secret ballot . 
  one thing that i find utterly baffling about american culture is the idea that you have to guard your daughters virginity .
