  [ the best council there is !, 
  ] ( https://satwcomic.com/nordic-council ), 
   our national anthem is n't official interestingly neither is ours , and nor does norway have an official national anthem . 
  i wonder is this is a nordic thing or is this an european thing . 
  it 's the principle that matters . 
  if you want to get rid off the president you 'll have to impeach him or her , and you can do that only if the president has broken the law . 
  you can get rid off a prime minister by a simple vote of no confidence in the parliament . 
  i honestly do n't want a more power for president . 
  i dislike the idea that you should have a one person who 's supposed to have all the answers . 
  besides it 's easier the get rid off a bad prime minister than it is to get rid of a bad president . 
  one kekkonen was enough . 
  i have no idea who he ( ? ), 
  is , but i 'm not really the target audience , so ... 
  [ neil hardwick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neil_hardwick ) , a writer and director who 's originally from england and has written and directed several comedies that are loved by finns . 
  we have two that dominates the market : [ oikotie.fi ] ( https://asunnot.oikotie.fi/myytavat-asunnot ) , which i believe is bigger and [etuovi.com ] ( http://www.etuovi.com/?locale=en ) . 
  oikotie also has car and employment adds and it is only in finnish . 
  really ? 
  i guess that i 'm so used to them that i do not find them unusual or strange . 
   candles are brought to all the graves of dead relatives . 
  we also have two candels [ on the windowsill ] ( http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7168/6472297769_22a8cc3ae0_b.jpg ) . they even sell [ special candles ] ( http://cartina.photo/fi/imagebank/large-image/117/117581/itsen%e4isyysp%e4iv%e4n+kynttil%e4t+117581.jpg ) for the independence day . 
  same . 
  i usually have between 15 to 40 euros just in case there is problem with card payments , but i hardly ever use cash . 
  and i 've yet to have a need to buy something illegal . 
   culturally we are the odd man out in the nordics really except we are not really . 
  true that we speak non-germanic language and have been influenced by russia , but we are not really that dissimilar with other nordics especially with sweden . 
  there is an eat-west divide in finland and my family is mostly from the western side of that divide , which might influence my perception . 
  i was taught at school that britteinsaaret ( the british isles ) consist of islands of ireland , the great britain and the surrounding smaller islands . 
  it was n't until fairly recently , that learned that the irish do n't like the term . 
   the norm is to tip 5-10 % at dinner restaurants when you have a waiter . 
  as a rule ? 
  every time like in the usa ? 
  i thought that in sweden you 'll tip only if you think that the service was exceptional . 
  i do n't know how hard this is for foreigners but the word ` olympialaiset ' ( olympic games ) is often mispronounced as either ` olumpialaiset ' or ` olimpialaiset ' . 
  that 's because finnish has [ vowel harmony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony#finnish ) and the word olympilaiset breaks it . 
  yes , you are supposed to inflect all the numbers and not separate them , unless you are just listing numbers . 
  however , you are not supposed to spell numbers over 10 when writing them down and in spoken finnish people tend to skip some of the infections , like ` satakaheskymmenest ( \u00e4 ) viidest ( \u00e4 ) ' . 
  [ here you can find examples how numbers are written in finnish ] ( http://www.kielikello.fi/index.php?mid=2&amp;pid=11&amp;aid=120 ) . 
  the article is in finnish . 
  no apologies needed . 
  i just wanted to be sure what you meant by native . 
  i 'll take it that by native you mean the ones spoken within sweden ? 
  literal translation would be ` have one 's own cow in the ditch ' , meaning that you are doing something for selfish reasons , you have a vested interest . 
  i studied swedish in school , as we finns do , and we were taught the local finnish swedish dialect were ` sj ' is pronounced using the [ \u0282 sound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_retroflex_sibilant ) , which i find easier than the one that is used in sweden . 
  in my home we used to have : gooseberry redcurrant blackcurrant rhubarb chives onions potatoes carrots strawberries and lettuce . 
  i would say that our garden was fairly typical . 
  a section reserved useful plants . 
  we lived in a smallish town close to the helsinki . 
  do you mean [ something like this ] ( https://zen.homezada.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ac-window-unit2.jpg ) when you say a window unit ? 
  at least in finland you can not install one of those because [ we have different kind of windows ] ( http://media.taloon.com/image/upload/q_70,f_auto,w_400,h_650,c_limit/cloud/k/pihla/b_mallin_ikkuna_salekaihtimilla_ulkoa.jpg ) . 
  you would have to buy something [ like this one ] ( https://cdn-d.verkkokauppa.com/1920/images/7/2_364430-1333x2145.jpeg ) and those are n't necessarily as cheap , plus they take floor space . 
   they do get a share from the corporation taxation this was changed in 2016 . 
  they no longer get a share of corporate tax revenue . 
  now they get a set sum from the state budget , which as you said , is earmarked . 
  ca n't say if it is the best , but i enjoyed the [ ihmiselon ihanuus ja kurjuus ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097562/ ) . 
  my understanding is that in kalsarik\u00e4nni you slowly drink until you are drunk , whereas in binge drinking your goal is to become drunk as fast as possible . 
  the word i usually associate with kalsarik\u00e4nni is ` tissutella ' , which means drinking ( alcohol ) slowly . 
  binge drinking , which is glamorised . 
  the idea that you have to be strong and not ask for help . 
  i was taught british english at school also i was in an english play school for couple of years when i was a child , that had english and finnish teachers . 
  because of this i find british english more familiar and use the uk spellchecking if possible . 
  the american influence is stronger and nowadays you usually see american spelling in sings etc. 
  also i tend to mix them myself and not being very consistent . 
   for some reason large groups of jews never moved here . 
  it was illegal for jews to live in sweden and when we were separated from sweden in 1809 we kept the old laws . 
  so all of the 19th century it was illegal to move in finland if you were a jew . 
  only exception were russian soldiers that had a permission to stay anywhere within the empire after their service . 
  it was only after the independence , 22nd of december 1917 , did the jews get full civil rights in finland . 
  i believe we have couple of thousand jews in finland . 
  about 2 kilometres , and it takes between 10 to 15 minutes . 
  i 'll use either bus or tram , if i do n't walk . 
  `` semla '' in finnish swedish means [ a type of bread ] ( https://www.valio.fi/mediafiles/ecab7df3-3864-4273-a903-8ec5d0326b54/2560x ) but in sweden it means [ a filled sweet bun ] ( https://orosanna.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/wp_20140602_070.jpg ) that it traditionally eaten in february . 
  what is called semla here is `` sm\u00e5franska '' in sweden . 
  and if you go to a cafe in estonia and order for a viineri , hoping to get a danish pastry , you 'll get a type of sausage ( viiner ) . 
  we got our word for danish pastry through swedish : wienerbr\u00f6d -  viineri . 
  is your viiner a german loanword ? 
  hawaii or new mexico . 
  is n't there still some names that are spelled with double a instead of \u00e5 ? 
  i remember reading somewhere that you can use aa for \u00e5 . 
   samnorsk does it not translate as a common norwegian ? 
  so was there a movement to have norwegian that combined nynorks and bokm\u00e5l ? 
  some loan word has been replaced with native words , like for example word for a telephone . 
  the old loan word is telefooni but the word we use now is [ puhelin ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/puhelin ) . 
  also there has been changes to the way we write some word , they either gained or lost letters . 
   \u00e4\u00e4 -  ea has the pronunciation also changed ? 
  we have had two female prime ministers and she was the first one . 
  she was in office for 66 days . 
  she used information from classified documents during the election campaign . 
  the court later acquitted her for any wrong doing , but before that she lost the confidence of the coalition partners and decided to resign . 
   talsinki that is too close to the word ` talsia ^ * ' - if we have to have a common name the hellinn ( a ) is better . 
  ^ * traipse or lumber for you linguistically challenged , 
  2015 when on a nearby lot during construction work they managed to cut the power cable . 
  before that some time in the early 2000 . 
  i do n't remember our counties having flags . 
  instead of flags people use [ household pennants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_pennant ) . 
  your guess is as good as mine , 
  i take it that they have never actually been here ... 
  [ the obligatory scandinavia and the world comic ] ( https://satwcomic.com/just-a-number ) . 
  mine 's off , it did n't guess correctly where i am from . 
  interestingly when i was in school we were taught british english , which might explain my results : our top three guesses for your english dialect : ? 
  new zealandish 2 .
