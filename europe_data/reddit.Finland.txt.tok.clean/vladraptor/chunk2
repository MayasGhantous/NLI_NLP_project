  reindeers are semi-domesticated and they usually roam free in lapland . 
  they are n't exactly bred to be kept in a farm . 
   we think of them as cute little santa pets . 
  i just read today from a newspaper ( well , tabloid ) how a cute little pet killed one family 's hunting dog . 
  [ source in finnish ] ( http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288756018994.html ), 
  luckily not too much similar . 
  i do n't like game but i do like reindeer . 
  yes , but we have a special dispensation for being swedes for 700 years . 
   also , where was the contest held ? 
  in a lovely quaint town of nuovo jorcia , the home of many , many italians . 
  oh do n't tease the swedes by putting words ` danish ' and ` right ' in the same sentence . 
  are there any theories why you kept your language and did n't adopt any of those aforementioned languages ? 
  it helps if you know old finnish words and german or swedish . 
  i was surprised not to see a line between german and estonian as to my ear it seems that estonian has more germanic loanwords than we do . 
  are there actual riots ? 
  looked more like a demonstration than a riot . 
   the new wave you are going to lose a what ? 
  i have to ask , how many towns are there in germany which were spared during the world war ii ? 
  i 've read a book written by a german , a few years back , about the bombing of the germany and i got the impression that most town and cities especially were destroyed . 
  have to say that it was n't a very easy book to read . 
  [ of course you have ] ( http://www.urban75.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/morris-dancers-01.jpg ) !, 
   cameron would probably make an agreement with the eu similar to that norway has but would n't that be opposite what he is trying to achieve ? 
  free movement but no say on the future eu directives ? 
  i did n't find anything what happened to the citizen from other eec countries when greenland left the eec but as it is - only nordic citizens have free movement and right to work in greenland . 
  eu citizens do n't . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/greenland/work.htm ), 
  it would be odd for british to retain eu citizenship if uk would leave the eu as eu citizenship is dependent of you being a citizen of an eu member country . 
  more likely they 'll broker some sort of deal that uk citizens may stay in the countries of their residents . 
  [ leip\u00e4juusto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leip%c3%a4juusto ) , although i do n't eat it often as it is quite pricey . 
  it still has a runway or runways . 
  even if damaged it is easier to fix than to build a new runway . 
  i see , i 've always assumed otherwise when it comes to the car prices , especially as it is a necessity , but i must admit i have no personal experience of owning any car . 
   $ 550 on their cars i always thought that cars were cheap in the usa . 
  as it happens the chairman of the homeschooling association of finland is a devout christian and i remember him saying in an interview that the reason why he and his wife wanted to homeschool was that they wanted their children to grow up in a proper christian environment . 
  of course he does , how else would he know how to avoid it . 
   starve everyone ? 
  why would you serve them british cuisine ? 
  it worked as long as you were in power there , so the real solution is ... 
  but what about the branches ? 
  so the solution is to unify india , bangladesh and pakistan . 
  it will take countries from former eastern european bloc a generation or two to get to the same level as countries which were part of former western european bloc has , but i do think it is a bit extreme to say that they are not in europe . 
  is it wrong to assume that most hungarians support orb\u00e1n and his party 's policies ? 
   they are scamming assholes pretty much everywhere in the world luckily not here . 
  the fares are set by government decree . 
   very convenient for giving an important amount of money to somebody only time i 've seen a check as an adult was when i bought my apartment . 
  the bank gave the previous owner a check . 
  technically i gave the check but since it was money i loaned from the bank the teller gave it directly to the seller . 
  i you can still buy a gift check from a bank if you want to give money as a gift but do n't want to give euro notes but something more festive . 
  other than those occasions you never see checks as they were phased out in mid 90 's . 
  i see , i remember my parents having a checkbook when i was a child but they were phased out in mid 90 's and nobody uses them anymore . 
  thank you . 
  the style of that article was such that it made me question whether its writer has something against italy or the italians and is cherry picking his numbers so that they appear worse than they are . 
  luckily there were , 
  i know , i 'm not danish  in fact we have semi regularly warnings of a moose or a deer wandering into helsinki city centre . 
  quite often police have to put them down if they are unable to guide them back to the forest . 
  latest incident was this summer : http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-27780337 i can also remember couple occasions when there were warnings that a bear was loitering around and in the suburbs . 
  is this true : `` sicily , for instance , employs 28,000 forestry police -- more than canada -- and has 950 ambulance drivers who have no ambulances to drive . '', 
  especially the last bit about the ambulance drivers ? 
  the way that article was written i would n't be surprised if they are exaggerating and those numbers are n't entirely accurate . 
   dont you worry about wild animals ? 
  that was a good one !, 
  i 'll just leave [ this here ] ( http://satwcomic.com/wonderful-nature ) , 
  i think that you can thank or blame [ finlandia vodka ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/mtywmfgxmjaw/z/5f4aaoswek9t8mh4/$_57.jpg ) for that association . 
  it used to be fairly popular , more prestigious , brand . 
   bank checks you still use checks in france ? 
  or had the landowner 's permission , yes that too crossed my mind . 
  how do we use singular when talking about more than one euro ? 
  euro and sentti for singular ~ ~ and for plural euroa and sentti\u00e4 ~ ~ edit : what toppo said , 
  if i remember my biology classes from school you really do n't have to worry about kids if you are using your ass . 
  or more [ modern version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pulxxvetiok ) of it . 
  funny enough when i was watching that video in back of my mind i was thinking that you are not suppose to cut down trees in a forest , not even little ones . 
  no , you are not suppose to build open fire in a forest - you are suppose to use a burner or a stove . 
  what can i say - i 've internalised [ every man 's rights ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam#finland ) and their restrictions . 
  maybe they somehow managed to keep the protestant work ethics even though they lost the religion , or if not that , then maybe it 's those finnic genes !, 
  i do n't find that surprising at all . 
  americans tend to have higher average income but you also have expenses we do n't . 
  i do n't have to pay monthly fee for my health insurance and tickets for public transport are usually cheaper for a user in europe . 
  i like both [ nordic classicism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_classicism ) and [ functionalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/functionalism_ ( architecture % 29 ) but i 'm not that picky . 
  i like different styles for different reasons . 
  there are sample pages of that kymppi 1a book : https://sanomapro.fi/static/samplepages/000000000000559987/ and laskutaito 1a https://sanomapro.fi/static/samplepages/000000000000521960/, 
  no tip should be eu standard . 
  there , i fixed that for you . 
   how does that count ? 
  in this case as in this statistics cyprus is considered encompassing the whole island . 
  others have already explained eu 's stance on cyprus so i wo n't go there but there are several examples where de facto and de jure do n't meet . 
  crimea is one of them - true de facto it is part of russia but de jure it is a part of ukraine under russian occupation . 
  also different factions may have different definitions - for example russia considers crimea to be part of it , de jure . 
  i 'm no expert of international justice but usually the de facto becomes de jure when there is enough international consensus or the country to which the area once was a part of agrees to it . 
  i too vaguely remember reading that article . 
  i do wonder what kind of database they had if knowing neighboring countries helped ( or as in this case , not ) . 
  i would imagine that in a fine restaurant the prices are so high that they really do n't need the tips but if you were going to tip at all 4 francs ( 0,61 euros ) would have been an insult :d, 
  the current system we have was organised in 1974 when teacher 's seminars were reorganised as university faculties . 
  as you can see , our current system for educating teachers is not that old and there is no reason to believe that you can not reform yours if you really want to . 
  of course it helps that in finland teachers are generally respected , which in my very humble opinion , stems from the fact that education in itself is respected and desired . 
  in late 19th century in the rural communities the teacher usually had other positions of trust ( the finnish word is luottamusteht\u00e4v\u00e4 , not sure if my translation in english is correct ) within that community because they were educated plus they could read and write fluently . 
  you could say that we have always had a great respect for a learned man - the hero in our national epos is a sage not a warrior , but that might be stretching it a bit . 
   in some ways people look teachers as martyrs . 
  when did this happen ? 
  i do n't remember ever thinking that any of my teachers were or are martyrs . 
  but de jure it is not and that 's what counts in this case .
