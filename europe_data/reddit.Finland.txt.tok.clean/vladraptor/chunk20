  english ( england ) 3 . 
  scottish ( uk ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : ? 
  polish 2 . 
  hungarian 3 . 
  greek -, 
  boston , providence and new york . 
  thank you !, 
  it does indeed . 
  warm water dissolves body 's natural oils . 
  recommendation is that you have short showers and use cool water , even when you do n't have daily showers . 
  i shower once a day or every other day . 
  probably vermont , although i would miss sea , because they seem to be most progressive one . 
  michigan upper peninsula might be also an interesting one because it has the highest concentration of finnish descendants in the usa . 
  but i have a feeling that they might be too conservative for my taste . 
  problem with both of them is that i do n't really enjoy rural lifestyle . 
   a bumper sticker that had a picture of the confederate flag with the words `` if this offends you , you need a history lesson . '', 
  do you happen know or guess what that means ? 
  is n't there some estonian dialect that still have the vowel harmony ? 
  haha , he probably mixed up ` pilli ' and ` pillu ' . 
  first one means straw but the later is a ( bit ) vulgar term for female genitalia . 
  the letter [ '' \u00d5 '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%95 ) is hard for me to pronounce . 
  also the lack of vowel harmony can be distracting - word is very familiar but goes against the proper ( finnish ) pronunciation . 
  maybe he was from [ n\u00e4rpes ] ( http://www.sls.fi/sv/ort/narpes ) . 
  i do n't know what language they speak but it ai n't swedish !, 
  i used to work in a call centre and once i had to tell a person , who called from n\u00e4rpes , that i have to ask my swedish speaking colleague to call him back . 
  i just could n't understand a word he said . 
   on another note , does n't finlandssvenskar ( born in 1980 +  speak finnish as well as swedish . 
  not necessarily . 
  if they live in areas of the \u00d6sterbotten where swedish speakers are in majority . 
  they probably only use swedish in their daily life and situation is comparable to finnish speakers who in theory can speak swedish as they have learned it in school but in practice do not . 
   the soviet era linnahall it looks like a cross between a bunker and a mexican pyramid . 
  i think it 's nice but i mainly associate it with sports events because you usually hear it there , if finland happens to win . 
  we have two versions , if you can call them versions , where the melody is the same but lyrics are different . 
  that 's because one is in [ finnish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7cporwx5m ) and the other one is in [ swedish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivyoirxddnq ) . 
  swedish lyrics ( and the melody ) are from 1848 and finnish translation is from 1867 . 
  fun facts ( or not ) : we share the melody with estonia , and there is no law that says which song is our anthem . 
  current one has been established gradually by convention over the years . 
   by the way , i 'm still mystified why aldi and lidl think one square foot of desk near the cashier is enough packing space for your purchases . 
  people kept packing their groceries at those small desk and blocking the checkout . 
  after a couple of years lidl simply gave up . 
  [ it 's a pity that you changed the shade of the blue . 
  i think that the old one looks nicer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/swedish_historical_flags_at_maritime_museum2.jpg ) . 
   probably that we are pretty reserved . 
  funny thing is that one stereotype that swedes have in finland is that you are insufferably chatty and nice to everybody , even to strangers . 
  i think he 's referring to the stereotype that baltic people have about estonians being very slow . 
  i do n't know where op is from but no , it is not common to but ketchup on pizza . 
  we have those too , and had the same name , [ we too call them just kisses nowadays ] ( https://urjalanmakeistukku.fi/6068-thickbox_default/brunberg-suukkolava-192-rasiaa-varainhankintaan.jpg ) . 
  no , i do not . 
  i used to think that i 'm an agnostic but i 've come to realise that i 'm actually an atheist . 
  the difference is that in nordic countries the protestant church is or was a state church and it had responsibilities that usually the government has , like for example keeping census records . 
  also the government had a say on the matters regarding church , for example in finland the president appointed the bishops ( the law was changed 2001 ) . 
  since historically the church was a part of the government you paid taxes . 
  in america do n't you have a constitutional ban for a state church and your churches live on donations ? 
  was n't the switch over one of the reasons why stockholm trams were discontinued ? 
  i remember reading somewhere that they would have had to rebuild all the trams so that the doors would have been on the right side of them and make significant changes to the network . 
  since the opinions at the time heavily favoured the cars , and trams were considered to be an obsolete mode of transportation , the city of stockholm decided to cancel the whole service . 
  [ h\u00e4m\u00e4laismurteet ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/h%c3%a4m%c3%a4l%c3%a4ismurteet.png ) is the one that i like the most , especially from southern h\u00e4me ( [ 3c on the map ] ( https://www.kotus.fi/files/1920/murrealueet.pdf ) ) , but that 's probably because most of my extended family comes from around [ h\u00e4meenlinna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a4meenlinna ) so i 'm used to hearing it at wedding , funerals , birthday celebrations . 
  [ here 's an example from renko ] ( http://scripta.kotus.fi/av/kuuntele/3c_renko.mp3 ) . 
  you do have long words in deed . 
  finnish word can get quite long because you need to add the cases at the end of the words . 
  is n't that a contradiction in terms ? 
   the candidates and their corresponding numbers are listed on a paper that should be inside of the booth . 
  [ the list looks like this ] ( http://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1198,h_674,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/13-3-9544077.jpg ) . 
  it 's either a very thick soup or thin porridge . 
  if you do n't use wheat flower it more on the thin side . 
  it 's smooth , a bit slimy especially the macaronis . 
  \u00e5 , \u00e4 and \u00f6 but \u00e5 is only used in swedish names . 
  then there are the letters : b , c , f , q , w , x and z that we only use in loan words , like for example ` faarao ' , witch means pharaoh . 
  my long lost soulmate . 
  i would add that i do n't like coffee . 
  i was 16 when i tried drinking alcohol and smoking - did n't really develop a taste for either one of them . 
  most of my family comes from southern h\u00e4me , so this might be a regional thing . 
  also i was taught that : vaari = mother 's father ukki = father 's father . 
  technically our first king , as a fully sovereign nation , was also our last one : the [ prince frederick charles of hesse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_frederick_charles_of_hesse ) . 
  the constitution would have granted him quite extensive powers but since germany lost the wwi he abdicated never setting a foot in finland . 
  also the parliament that voted finland to become a kingdom did n't have the parties on the left , like social democrats because we just had a civil war between the reds and whites and the reds lost . 
  before that between 1809 - 1917 we were a grand duchy within the russian empire with the russian emperor as the grand duke of finland . 
  one of the oddest reforms , i find , was the one were the king can not no longer award medals of royal orders to the swedes , only to the members of royal family and foreigners . 
  perfect way to befriend that old wino who 's now convinced that you 'll be his supply of alcohol . 
  he might even invite you to his place , mind the knives though ... 
  it is , ca n't argue with that . 
  especially with warm karelian pies . 
  [ they even have it ready made for us lazy people ] ( http://www.laitilankanatarha.fi/munavoi ) . 
  you mean [ munavoi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egg_butter ) ? 
  that 's sweden and their surstr\u00f6mming . 
  finland allows overnight camping but you can not have an open fire without landowners permission . 
  [ if you do n't have the permission you 'll have to use these stoves instead ] ( http://www.primus.eu/media/catalog/product/cache/2/image/800x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/3/p321444_0.jpeg ) . 
  elite dangerous ( uk ) and alan wake ( finland ) . 
  in my family we used to play a lot of [ marjapussi ] ( https://www.pagat.com/marriage/marjapussi.html ) . 
  why thank you, 
  how much would the mortgage be in current currency , do you happen to know ? 
  latest statistic that i could find is from 2015 and it said that the average number of people in a family was 2.8 persons . 
  it also said that 74.4 % of the finns live in a family . 
  in 1950 the numbers were : 3.7 and 85.8 % . 
  [ the greek owl of athena ] ( https://www.fleur-de-coin.com/images/currency/km200/km187a_2002a.jpg ) [ i also like the dutch one with the profile of beatrix ] ( https://en.numista.com/catalogue/photos/pays-bas/g617.jpg ) . 
  yes there are . 
  some swedish historical figures but i do n't know if that really counts as they are also our historical figures , the noble family of [ fleming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fleming_of_louhisaari ) and [ their street ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.1857032,24.9533043,3a,75y,11.92h,86.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sf52ipxunhibd0msee9_-ga!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  also there is a [ tukholmankatu ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.1911963,24.9048208,3a,75y,79.4h,94.51t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srbzwuyknbolxdwvxtopouq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) ( stockholm street ) , [ tallinnanaukio ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/70888952.jpg ) ( tallinn square ) . 
  and helsinki was moved on the [ vironniemi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vironniemi ) ( cape of estonia ) when the waterway to the old site proved to be non navigable . 
  so only whipped cream ?
