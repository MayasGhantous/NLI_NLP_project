  in finland the traditional filling would be [ almond paste ] ( http://yesdeli.fi/media/catalog/product/cache/4/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/l/a/laskiaispulla_ja_mantelimassa_2.jpg ) , or as we call it matelimassa / mandelmassa . 
  more resent variation has strawberry jam in it instead of almond paste . 
  you can buy [ either version ] ( http://www.fazershop.com/globalassets/inriver/resources/9ff3dc12-f5d1-48a5-aaba-47201978df65.png ) of [ them ] ( http://www.fazershop.com/globalassets/inriver/resources/4118bbbb-0b5a-4b0c-ad04-f7a01522f5d7.png ) from shops and cafes . 
  those are nice - although i prefer mine with jam rather than with almond paste . 
  [ cabbage rolls ] ( http://hkruokatalo.studio.crasman.fi/pub/kuvat/blogit/k%c3%a4%c3%a4ryleannos.jpg?c=thumb_960x_540x ) , [ cabbage soup ] ( https://www.kotikokki.net/media/cache/large/recipeimage/large/52d6db9dd074a9ec0e06d081/original.jpg?1297428002 ) and [ cabbage casserole ] ( http://sipa.s-palvelut.fi/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.yhteishyva.fi%2fdocuments%2f18010%2f353251%2fkaalilaatikko.jpg%2faf39521d-95f3-4c40-8890-521e71210bee%3ft%3d1401712608000&amp;maxwidth=900&amp;highdensity=true&amp;checksum=6a5e704b9bff3f0edddcf36d3420457e ) . 
  what can i say - i like cabbage . 
  any love for finnish ? 
  btw you forgot lingonberry jam . 
   to clarify ; the difference has nothing to do with stress yes , i understood that , 
  the first one sounds more familiar to me , but that might be because in finnish the stress is always on the first syllable and the first example sounded like it had the stress at the beginning . 
  like so many finnish speaking finns i 've studied swedish at school but to be honest i use finnish tone when speaking swedish and trust that people understand from context that i mean duck and not the soul , not that i speak of either one of them often , if ever really . 
  after all [ context ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2vhgogn.png ) is a big thing in finnish . 
  how munch does dialect affect the tonality or is it the same regardless the dialect ? 
  kuusi ( six ) kuusta ( spruces ) . 
  kill , meet - what 's the difference . 
   estonian has many words ending with a suffix - seks he have that in common : '' - seksi '' , and to use your example to turn into yellow would be keltai * seksi * in finnish . 
  foreigners sometimes have trouble to differentiate short and long vowels and double consonants in finnish . 
  for example ` kuusi ' means a spruce or number six and ` kusi ' is colloquial word for piss . 
  there is the [ kotimaisten kielten keskus ] ( http://www.kotus.fi/ ) ( the institute for the languages of finland ) which is a research institute under the ministry of education . 
  it gives recommendations and guidelines how to use domestic languages . 
  usually media ( tv , newspapers , etc ) and government offices follow them but the institute does not have any authority force the use of them . 
  as you said it a mixture of units . 
  here is an example of a cake recipe : 2\u00a01/4 dl sugar 125 g butter 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1.5 dl milk 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon cardamom a pinch of salt 3 dl wheat flour, 
  if op does end up in the nordic countries he could time his visit between 20th and 22nd of june when we have the longest days and shortest nights here in northern hemisphere . 
  dance with swedes around the maypole . 
  if he has time he could also visit lapland and experience [ the nightless night ] ( https://vimeo.com/59739924 ) . 
  no , no , no !, 
  you are suppose to boil your potatoes with the skin to preserve all the vitamins . 
  i remember that when you knew how to peel your own potatoes that it was considered to be an achievement , you were a big boy . 
  at school after the second year you were suppose to peel your own potatoes but sometimes when i was lazy ate mine with the peels . 
  first two years we got machine peeled potatoes . 
  i 've read that only us northern europeans eat [ new potatoes ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/3414832/landscape16_9/1024/576/8d564ae835531219574c7e861b6011ca/jz/perunat.jpg ) and it 's not really a thing elsewhere . 
  true that the skin contains most of the vitamins etc but it also contains glycoalkaloids that are toxic to humans . 
  but if i remember correctly an adult has to eat a quite a lot of before you 'll get symptoms . 
  you can also use title and 3rd person if you wish to be polite or formal , like : ottaako ministeri kahvia ? 
  ( would the minister like to have some coffee ? 
  ) , when addressing a person . 
  i do n't know how common this is nowadays . 
  true but then i would not be able to go near windows . 
  i have a fear of heights so prefer not living higher than tree tops . 
  i do n't like very tall buildings because they cast so long shadows . 
  for example in my home the sun does not shine inside between october and march because sun never rises over opposite building . 
  imagine if that would be a true high-rise building or a skyscraper ? 
  i would live in perpetual twilight . 
  would the hapsburgs be the obvious choice ? 
  [ left-libertarian ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-4.88&amp;soc=-6.0 ) , apparently . 
  can you imagine getting your car in flat packs ... ... after you hunted down all of them in ikea 's warehouse . 
  i really like [ pernilla august ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000278/ ) . 
  there are also ` suomenmaa ' ( land of suomi ) and ` suomen niemi ' ( peninsula of suomi ) that can be used when talking about finland . 
  suomenmaa is also the name of the centre party 's party newspaper . 
  i do n't know if fennoswedes have different names for finland . 
  thank you for your reply . 
  if i remember correctly the person who wrote that was a foreign correspondent in france and the attitude might seem strange to a person who was brought up in a country that has very strong tendency of consensus in politics . 
  so strong that we easily have only one truth . 
  i once read that in france compromise is a dirty word and instead you are expected to fight rather than find a common ground . 
  is there any truth in that ? 
  how did they come to the conclusion that it was the jews ? 
  i was surprised how small the piccadilly circus was . 
  in pictures it seem bigger that it is in reality . 
  biksemad is what we call [ pyttipannu ] ( http://www.martat.fi/site/assets/files/4532/liha_pyttipannu_ruotsi_1.jpg ) i think . 
  not the same thing but i remember that there was an instance where a finnish journalist addressed the new ceo of teliasonera with `` ni '' and he was totally confused of whom the journalist is talking about . 
  in finland it is not uncommon to use second person plural if you wish to be polite . 
  a quick research and we do indeed use a swedish model . 
  in 1865 a group of students ordered first finnish student caps and they were modelled after uppsala ones . 
  do you know why your cap has a cross on it ? 
   we can agree that the swedes are evil , right ? 
  is there really any another option ? 
  and finland . 
  i forgot to mention that the havis amanda is in helsinki and the tradition to place a student cap on a statue has spread to other university cities . 
  and we use the same type of hat as you do . 
  if you go to a technical university then you 'll get a [ hat with a tassel ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/0/06/teekkarilakki.jpg ) . 
  [ mantan lakitus ] ( https://youtu.be/ztk7azy8dwc?t=3m57s ) where students of local universities place a student cap on the [ havis amanda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/havis_amanda ) statue on the first of may . 
  also norway and sweden should be in same colour as they were in a union at the time . 
  [ ruis feast ] ( http://www.mcdonalds.fi/fi/product/ruis-feast.html ) that is made with rye bread . 
  [ james may from top gear tried it in finland ] ( https://youtu.be/2bmqdnx5r1u?t=6m ) . 
  we have a variation of that tradition . 
  in christmas we serve rice porridge ( [ joulupuuro ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gt_r391xmc0/t-tlia-pxpi/aaaaaaaadgg/p_n_5m2cbl4/s400/riisip.jpg ) ) as a breakfast and a pot of it has a one whole almond . 
  whoever gets it will be lucky . 
  it 's usually served with cinnamon and either milk or prune or fruit [ kissel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kissel ) . 
  and [ suklaakonvehti ] ( http://www.lansi-savo.fi/sites/default/files/images/news_item/2_fazer.jpg ) , although i 'm not sure if that classifies as a desert . 
  because prince george ? 
  [ i can understand if it 's a long queue because you need your space but a queue is still a queue ] ( http://im.mtv.fi/image/6154420/landscape16_9/1024/576/30e211498042178da73441b1ecd37f97/ht/bussipysakki-jono-tampere.jpg ) . 
  what do you say if you have to make a separation between your extended family and immediate family ? 
  it 's fascinating how we have so many words that a similar . 
  in finnish ` h\u00e4rm\u00e4 ' is another word for ` kuura ' , which means a layer of ice crystals that form on surfaces , like tree branches when [ temperature is low and there is humidity in the air ] ( http://pohjoinenvalo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/k2c0294.jpg ) . 
  at the moment elite dangerous . 
  kuura , 
  it does but it 's not the same thing as ` perhe ' . 
  household is ` ruokakunta ' in finnish , which means food ( ruoka ) commune ( kunta ) , if translated literally . 
  ruokakunta includes your family but it can also include people to whom you are not related in anyway , like hired farm helps that used to live at the farm before the mechanisation of agriculture . 
   gezin : direct family ( parent , siblings , sometimes even your pet ) i find it odd that english does n't have separate words for your immediate family and extended family . 
  in finnish they are : perhe and suku . 
  [ oh laura from sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmx7iz2gbqo ) . 
  i would be tempted to go to very specific details just to see this shifting around uncomfortably . 
   she was sort of unknown before so i understood from finnish news . 
  for a second or two i thought that you elected kaljurand after all when reading the news . 
  [ eira , helsinki ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@60.1565563,24.9376545,3a,75y,123.53h,73.57t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2ufhmfvhybup4flsgcdlka!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and surrounding areas are considered upscale neighbourhoods . 
  i know it 's still early but what are people thinking about your next president kersti kaljulaid ? 
  linux , safety reflector , wireless ekg heart rate monitor . 
  i 'd imagine that people would more confused than angry as they would n't understand you .
