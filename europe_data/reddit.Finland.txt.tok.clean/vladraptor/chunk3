  i would like to see it become official . 
  as we have the long border with russians , they do n't and since there is no formal alliance with sweden ... 
  ... i would n't call it teaming up but it is what it is . 
  is it the owner of the building who is removing them or somebody else without any permissions ? 
  well this brings back childhood memories , it 's not the first time swedes are submarine hunting . 
  i can not honestly guess what the hell is russia trying to accomplish with this . 
  is there a reason why some italian politicians seem to be so pro putin and russia ? 
  but the passport is standardised travel document . 
  do we really need two of them ? 
  and you are right about the yanks !, 
  if only it had been written in french too , because it 's the new official language of the eu travel documents - you know , 
  to be honest i liked the previous design of ours more , the one that \u00c5land is using , than the current one . 
  it 's too cluttered with all the text in the middle . 
   op 's design is very internationally recognizable . 
  that it may be but there are couple of reasons why i do n't like it . 
  firstly it looks too much of a travel document issued by european union to an italian person rather than a passport issued by italy , a member of eu , to one of its citizens . 
  i like it more the way it is now . 
  there are common guidelines but each country has a unique design . 
  if eu becomes a federation then yes , an identical passport is a good thing . 
  the other thing , why i do n't like it , is that it looks too merry - bright colours , that flag strip . 
  passport is an important travel document and its design should reflect it - darker colours , metallic embossing , coat of arms etc. 
  i do n't mind the current burgundy red but dark purple might have been an interesting choice . 
  a bit of royalty in your pocket - you people of foreign lands , thou shalt bow before me !, 
  well , you probably should say `` you shall bow before me '' , one does not want to become too familiar with the masses , now do you . 
  ^ ^ the ^ ^ whole ^ ^ bowing ^ ^ thing ^ ^ - ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke . 
  because you can not use an id-card outside of the schengen area as a travel document . 
  it looks like some sort of a rallycar stripes . 
  burgundy was a compromise . 
  one of the early suggestions was lilac . 
  [ here 's an article about it ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21548936 ) . 
  i personally prefer the embossed coat of arms of the country than the flag or the eu stars . 
  [ here are most of the current passport covers of the eu member states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passports_of_the_european_union#overview_of_passports_issued_by_28_member_states ) . 
  is there any change that you could have an another referendum about the voting system in the near future or was that really a once-in-a-generation opportunity as mr. firth said at the time ? 
  was there actual study that a change in voting system would cost 250 million pounds ? 
  that sum does n't sound plausible . 
  what !? 
  what do you have against the children might i ask ?!, 
  yes , it was terrible ad that had really nothing to do with the question in the referendum . 
  that was hilarious and sad at the same time . 
  i 've always thought that british politicians are great orators - not all of them i see . 
  well was n't that a lovely ad that had nothing to do with the referendum . 
  what happened 1982 ? 
  there is a sudden spike in liberal 's popularity . 
  also , i 've read that you had a referendum about your voting system and people decided to keep current first past the post one by quite big margin 70 to 30 percents or something close to that ( if i remember correctly ) . 
  why did n't people want the change ? 
   miliband is so awful what 's wrong with him ? 
  why is he awful ? 
  i 've read elsewhere that people do n't like him but there has n't been any explanation why he is so disliked . 
  indeed !, 
  i do n't think that he meant it literally but as a metaphor how the world changed and nokia with our paper industry were caught off guard . 
  i 'm curious , is the king of belgians fluent in all official languages of belgium ? 
  does he have to be ? 
  reason why i was wondering it is that i 've heard that the king is one of the unifying factors in belgium ( do n't know if that is true or not ) . 
  unfortunately a lie repeated enough times becomes the truth if unchallenged . 
  you can always buy [ a micro apartement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4foar8i26g ) . 
  intet problem !, 
  and i blame google translator for any mistakes . 
  apparently the swedish idioms i 've learned do n't translate properly to danish like : f\u00f6r all del. 
  :d at least you tried !, 
  i could offer couple of comebacks but they are old ones and not really that funny anymore . 
  for the future , if you do n't mind , do n't use triple or quadruple vowels when writing faux finnish if you wish it to look more authentic . 
  how kind, 
  as i do n't follow sports in general and i 'm not initiated to the minutiae of the football so i do find it a bit boring . 
  i can understand why handball is more fun to watch . 
  okei , i was just curious . 
  in finland you did ' t have to have a surname until 1921 when we had our first law about surnames and until 1929 woman did n't have to take her husband 's surname ( before some took but not all - different traditions in different parts of country ) . 
  in 1987 law was changed and now women do n't have to take their husband 's name . 
  same sex couples not to be able to take common name when registering their partnership was a way to appease traditionalists and religious folk and to have some legal difference between marriage and registered partnership . 
  not be able to file a joint adoption is the other one , as / u/molehole pointed out . 
  irony of course is that our current , what people perceive as traditional , surname convention is n't that old - or traditional . 
   it feels weird to read . 
  because you did n't expect to read such a thing in a novel written 86 years ago or because the way it was written ? 
   finns like to get shitfaced and kill people . 
  people whom they have been getting shitfaced with and probably in a group of alcoholics and persons who are marginalised in society . 
  just to clarifyi , a bit . 
  lazy you say ? 
  i would n't call you lazy after this post . 
  [ happy ? 
  ] ( https://postcardsworldwide.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/fi-368110.jpg ) i know it 's a poster but it 's one of his best known works . 
  i might as well add couple of my favourites . 
  [ luxembourgin puistossa ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ubxe1xdvzy4/u0q3rq40czi/aaaaaaaaene/sfl2lguqzpa/s1600/edelfelt_pariisin_luxembourgin_puistossa.jpg ) ( at the luxembourg park ) by edelfelt and [ morsiamen laulu ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/gunnar_berndtson_-_the_bride's_song_-_google_art_project.jpg ) ( the bride 's song ) by gunnar berndtson . 
  i like the the ambiance those paintings have . 
  i do n't believe i 've ever heard or seen the risti\u00e4issaatto . 
  thank you for the information !, 
   i frowned upon the twelve naked boys as did the people of tampere , in 1906 . 
  actually most of the parishioners liked it but there were some who demanded that clothes should be painted on the boys . 
  name of that fresco is [ k\u00f6ynn\u00f6ksenkantajat ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=k%c3%b6ynn%c3%b6ksenkantajat&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=2ds7vlc4disfygo9p4hgag&amp;ved=0cdmqsaq ) ( the bearers of the vine ) and they are suppose to bear the vine of life , a rosevine with flowers and thorns . 
  as / u/lurkki2 said it 's lingonberry and it is on the side when served not one of the ingredients and you can make it with milk but usually just water , no milk what so ever . 
   hugo simberg his [ kuoleman puutarha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_garden_of_death ) ( the garden of death ) is one of my favourites . 
  [ helene schjerfbeck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helene_schjerfbeck ) is one painter whose paintings finns recognise and like , like [ the toipilas ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/b/bb/toipilas%e2%80%93helene_schjerfbeck.jpg ) ( convalesent ) . 
  [ her self portraits ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=helene+schjerfbeck&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1328&amp;bih=711&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=cyk7voulcyxqyqppq4g4cg&amp;ved=0cb4qsaq#tbm=isch&amp;q=helene%20schjerfbeck%20self%20portraits&amp;revid=792954411&amp;imgdii=_ ) are famous too . 
  you can see how her style changed over time and as she grew older they ressembler more and more of a scull . 
  [ schirn kunsthalle frankfurt ] ( http://www.schirn.de/en/helene_schjerfbeck.html ) has an exhebition of her art untill january - if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you are interested in her art . 
  is there anything other than scottish independence that unites the members of the snp ? 
  i remember reading from some news article that independence would be the death of the snp because it 's only common cause for ( some of ) it 's members . 
  [ kaalik\u00e4\u00e4ryleet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabbage_roll ) or [ kaalilaatikko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaalilaatikko ) - what can i say , i like cabbage .

  is the water company going to install water meters and people are afraid that this will result water becoming more expensive ? 
  we have them and one of my childhood memories is parents shouting : close the tap , do n't run the water if you are not using it - happy times :d,
