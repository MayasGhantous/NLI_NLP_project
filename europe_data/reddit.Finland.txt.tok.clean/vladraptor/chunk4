  please note that it is in finnish . 
  but i thought that rainbow flag was a peace flag in italy not necessarily a lgbt symbol . 
  [ here is an article ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/7523751 ) from finnish broadcasting corporation , yle with picutres from the second incident . 
  i did n't realise i was being anti-western . 
  if i was , it was unintentional . 
  i wonder whether that makes the most ardent conservatives to change their rhetoric or stick to their guns even more . 
  and \u00c5land, 
  sticks and stones - never believed that nursery rhyme as words can hurt you , but i 'm glad if you have managed take away the power that word had . 
  i was n't trying to make comparison between modern western world vs. others . 
  i was talking about western world , europe to be more specific , and whether you like it or not , religion and in our case christian faith , has affected our culture and how people perceive homosexuality and in some cases still does , even when person is an atheist . 
  also i 'm not trying to say that every christian is a homophobe and every secular person is openminded . 
  / u/olpainless ' experience tells otherwise - mine tells a different story . 
  thank you for the explanation for the use of the term queer . 
  i doubt that i 'll be using it anytime soon - it still seems offencive to my ear and is one of those words that you learn not to use . 
  thank you !, 
  only thing , which google found , that was anyway related to the context was gay skinhead movement and that did n't seem to be the right answer . 
   france is below the us . 
  what is the figure for the us ? 
  edit : thank you all for the figures . 
  sorry , i feel really stupid right now but in this context what is gsm ? 
  google was n't very helpful in this . 
  to be honest my first reaction was that this map can not be right . 
  we more accepting than swedes , that does n't sound right - until i checked the legend . 
  to me personally - darker pigment means more positive or negative and lighter pigments somewhere in the middle . 
  in what sense ? 
  higher than expected or lower ? 
   queer i thought that using that term was a faux pas . 
  estonia is not big in religion but is below average in that statistic so in a sense you are right but religion often enforces already homophobic mindset . 
  also i do n't think that you can separate culture and religion neatly - a homophobic culture in western word does have some of its bases in judeo-christian beliefs even when one does not believe in god . 
  please do n't , it all comes down how you correct people of course but i personally like if someone points out my most obvious mistakes . 
  yes , i know - it was just meant as a joke , a very feeble attempt apparently . 
  i was only trying to make a joke . 
  there 's the flag issue ... ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ just ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke !, 
  and here i was thinking that it 's otherway round . 
  once you legalise your relationship the sex gets cold and is hot before that . 
  and as you yourself pointed out : we all know how well that went ... 
  did n't meant to imply that or anything other than it was an interesting provision for independence . 
  had to google that . 
  there 's an interesting clause on that treaty : article vii required belgium to remain perpetually neutral . 
   meters per seconds surely if it was it would be metres per seconds . 
  funny how accurate a 40 year old tv-series can still be sometimes . 
  [ here 's a clip ] ( http://vimeo.com/85914510 ) of that dialogue that / u/angry _ spaniard linked if someone is interested . 
  i 've always wondered which country 's laws apply when the border goes through a building . 
  no , no - you can not smoke there , it 's not allowed . 
  move 15 centimetres here , then you can smoke as much as you want . 
  [ you do n't say ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_the_king_%28%c5%9awiebodzin%29 ) . 
  danes why do you call your nyheder news ? 
  there is a swedish documentary about swedish dialects and it has a [ section where you can hear ] ( http://youtu.be/5wo1mccruei?t=16m27s ) the differences in intonation and how it 's flatter in the east . 
  to sweden , perhaps , the bastion of conservative values . 
  oh , did n't realise that you too have spring elections coming . 
  still , there is time to the elections and people 's politic memory can be quite short at times . 
   these require 51 of 101 mps to be in favor . 
  do you mean that they need simple majority or that they really need all the members of parliament to be present at the vote , of which there must be at least 51 in favour of the changes in the laws ? 
  edit : thank you for clarification . 
  i do n't believe we have such a rule in our parliament ( majority of all the mps and not the votes ) and so i was a bit confused what that meant . 
  or maybe when the worst dust settles and people see that nothing dramatic really happened in their lives , after that law was passed , they 'll be more accepting ? 
  well if the wikipedia article is correct , should n't the island be given to sweden if they used swedish laws etc. 
  before wwii ? 
  can a person who speaks dutch understand german if he or she has n't studied it ? 
  written or spoken language or is both written and spoken swiss german that is unintelligible to austrians ? 
  with my very feeble swedish skills i can read some danish , enough that i have some sense what the text is about ( unless it uses special vocabulary , like in science papers ) , but trying to listen spoken danish i can pick up a word or two but no hope of understanding it . 
  what language is called swiss ? 
  do you mean romansh , or perhaps swiss german ? 
  yes . 
  hot , although there is a saying `` kylm\u00e4 kahvi kaunistaa '' ( cold coffee makes one look beautiful ) but that 's just to get someone to drink the last batch of lukewarm coffee left in the pot . 
  that reminds me of the mourning dannebrog . 
  for power water , you know . 
  [ the flag of estland ] ( http://macollectiondepieces.pagesperso-orange.fr/images/baltes/estland.jpg ) . 
  sweden here is the real failure , letting the dutch break our nordic straight . 
  which makes coffee taste better of what ? 
  sorry , i do n't drink coffee so i 'm oblivious of all these things . 
  even before modern coffee machines coffee was big in finland , [ a brief history of coffee in finland ] ( http://www.kysy.fi/en/kysymys/history-coffee-party-finland ) by the helsinki city library . 
  before coffee machines every home had a [ coffee pot and a coffee bean grinder ] ( http://www.museo-opas.fi/sites/default/files/styles/lightbox/public/museum_other/kahvimylly%20ja%20pannu.jpg ) with a [ roasting pan ] ( http://otavafiles.fi/plaza/uploads/images/ruokafi/ruokajutut/brannari_hayha.jpg ) . 
  who keeps coffee in the fridge ? 
  no wonder brits use milk with tea . 
  not that i 'm complaining - i drink my tea with milk , all kinds of teas , for the horror of true tea connoisseurs . 
  sometimes with milk and lemon . 
  true , tea is n't big here . 
  usually choices are coffee or lipton yellow label in a coffee cup . 
   what next ? 
  2015 fins the most tea drinking people ? 
  i 'm doing my best !, 
  they have several sami languages . 
  careful with the alcohol - it 's no l\u00e4tt\u00f6l , next you 'll find yourself wanting sweden to adopt the euro . 
  [ film on tv ] ( http://www.filmon.com/tv/live ) lets you watch , among other things , british tv-channels . 
  there is a windows 8 app for it also . 
  since what ? 
  only way i know is to comment your own post - maybe there is someone more reddit savvy who knows better way . 
  thank you but no need to apologise me , no harm done to me . 
  not really looking for controversy more along the lines of hoping that this was n't posted to create one . 
  as you offered no explanation why you posted the photo i was puzzled about the reasons behind it . 
  granted , it tells more about me than you that i was entertaining a possibility for someone trying to create a controversy . 
  edit : in finland you give your vote to a candidate so we have had politicians who have had a quite a bit of character but for the most part , if you wish to be considered as a believable politician you can not be too funny or eccentric . 
  you 'll see more flesh on a beach , if that is the point . 
  without the context it is a bit silly photo but that 's about it . 
  are there any talks about a separate english parliament ? 
  it looks odd , but that 's mainly because i 'm used to seeing earth depicted the other way around - north up , south down . 
  if i had been brought up with that map i would think that the current norm looks equally odd . 
  however , i do think that it is rather silly to center it at the pacific ocean , unless it is a map of the pacific ocean . 
  to be honest , if someone would have asked me what 's in the picture i too would have said denmark .
