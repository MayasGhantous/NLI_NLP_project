  they are planning to build a lng terminal at [ ing\u00e5 / inkoo ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/10210+ing%c3%a5/@60.0185423,23.9712541,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x468d9939488606a7:0x400b551554badc0 ) and an undersea pipe to estonia ( that dotted line on the map ) . 
  the terminal wo n't be operational until 2016 , do n't know about the pipeline . 
  so yes , there are plans but they take time . 
  there is no transfer network from norway . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( http://www.gasum.fi/siirtoportaali/suomen-kaasuverkosto/ ) of our gaspipe network . 
  is there a reason for your question other than curiosity ? 
  i like [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccbizrmslyc ) of song mysteriet deg . 
  a norwegian song by bj\u00f8rn eidsv\u00e5g , sung in finnish and swedish by aki sirkesalo and lisa nilsson . 
  [ in finnish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viny15cystc ) and [ in swedish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkieewru3hi ) . 
  edit : let us not forget [ yes sir i can boogie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnbkstk-1ag ) . 
  thank you for the link . 
  slightly off topic : did n't quite many loose theirs after the war because they had to sell the lands to pay inheritance taxes ? 
   suopotkupallo is not a real sport it 's not . 
  belgian chocolate is better . 
  nah , did n't find that insulting at all . 
  besides , i can watch silently as someone tries to be chatty and invasive . 
  it 's kind of fun to see them crumple . 
  my favourite was : `` ioc members will be received with a smile on arrival at hotel '' . 
  never knew that poverty was this bad in britain so recently . 
  in that last photo that add feels almost like a bad joke . 
  well in this case i did n't understand it . 
  i got the impression that he was joking but did n't get the joke . 
  of course we do , everybody has some sense of humour but in order the humour to work one should have some knowledge what is said , some cultural reference etc. 
  i do not understand the connection between petrol coloured skies , the smell of rotting meat and countries in former eastern block , so i do n't get the joke , although i too am guessing that he was making one . 
  i would have thought that you have enough russians in your country as it is . 
  but do they want russian protection ? 
  do n't know about astronauts but they did manage to [ crash a probe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars_climate_orbiter#cause_of_failure ) on mars . 
  because everybody is in church whole day , or what ? 
   if you like seafood you 'll be in paradise . 
  and if you do n't like it you 're in hell ? 
  how come turkey has an olympic stadium ? 
  not really - i like the dutch . 
  i almost feel guilty , but for us it was a good deal : 100 tanks for the price of 2 fighter jets . 
  by the way , thanks for the discount tanks !, 
  i have a feeling , that it is so big for domestic reasons . 
  not tinfoily reasons of needing army to keep the hoi polloi in check , but because their large military provides jobs , not only in the military but companies that are associated with it . 
  it provides opportunities for the poor to get an education and free healthcare . 
  you might get killed before you can enjoy your benefits but i doubt that many think of that when recruiting . 
  and i believe i read somewhere that one reason why american police is getting militarised is pentagon selling them surplus weapons and materials , which it has in abundance . 
  equipment meant for warzone , not policing small town america . 
  but was n't iraq a british mandate not french ? 
  not all of us are in nato . 
  lucky for you they 'll probably end up fighting each other before they leave the irish soil . 
  french took part of the battle of bomarsund but it was mainly the british that that harassed the archipelago and the coasts of finland . 
  the british attacked towns on the coasts of bays of bothnia and finland and burned tar warehouses , too bad that the tar in them was theirs . 
  we even have a [ war trophy ] ( https://www.kokkola.fi/palvelut/kulttuuripalvelut/museot_ja_perinnetyot/kh_renlundin_museo/nayttelyt/vene/en_gb/vene/ ) taken from the royal navy in kokkola/karleby , which the british help to maintain . 
  neither did i. 
  in my case you could say 1 1/2 out of three . 
  i knew there are several saami languages and some of them have few speakers but i did n't know pite saami especially . 
  probably because it is an old map and because de jure it still is part of ukraine . 
  i know that de facto it is under russian rule but usually maps use de jure borders . 
  i would say no as the union was mutual agreement not danish invasion . 
  or non for us as there was no finland as a political entity at the time of the invasion . 
  but is n't that your national sport or something ? 
  i think that for sweden it would be russia , granted it happened over 200 years ago . 
  edit : never mind , point is successfully . 
  if a large part counts as successfully , then yes . 
  if not , then no country , if i remember my history lessons correctly . 
  wikipedia says no . 
  `` such is europe 's shameful and largely forgotten history of putting animal `` criminals '' on trial '' i do n't understand why it is shameful ? 
  by modern standards and knowledge it was pointless but i can not really feel ashamed by it . 
  pity that he did n't promise to pay the trip to chili 's also . 
  and yes , it sounded as if he just invited all of slovenia to dinner . 
  if i remember my geography lessons from school correctly , [ k\u00f6livuoristo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_mountains ) or scandinavian mountains , as they are called in english , makes our winters to have occasional warmer periods ( days basically ) when temperatures rises over 0 degrees of celsius , reason of that rise is the [ f\u00f6hn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foehn_wind ) . 
  i believe that those mountains are also a reason why norway is relatively rainy country . 
  what he said !, 
  which is why they are not spending their oil money but saving it for the rainydays . 
  hate my family ? 
  i do n't hate my family . 
  i love them , from afar . 
  well swedes are talkative . 
  that endless banter - i can not for the life of me fathom how they do it ... 
   non-homo-gay-nazi-jews have n't you been listening ? 
  putin says that there are no russian soldiers in ukraine . 
   from southpark i would n't use it even for english lessons , 
  i think you are making rather broad generalisations based on the fact that we , like other languages , tend to adapt the loanwords to better fit them into our own language . 
  in our case we have two official languages and those are the most common names given in 2012 in finnish and swedish . 
  estonians are big fans of [ the rasmus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcb0lnrmfw4 ) ? 
  does swedish have a native version of william like we do ( viljami ) ? 
  that 's the german speaking population of switzerland not liechtenstein on the map . 
  that , had to check it out from the statistics . 
  they are the most popular names given in finland by swedish speaking finns . 
  it 's somewhat confusing since the names are placed in the north and not on the western coast . 
  when ? 
  smaller pond makes you seem bigger . 
  irish ? 
  irish protestants are originally from glasgow area ? 
  but i thought that they are stout unionists ? 
  and they hoped that an independent scotland would change that . 
  i can see the motivation . 
   weegie had to google that one - apparently a word that one should not use if one ever visits scotland , and glasgow particularly . 
  i 've seen braveheart only once and to be honest i do n't remember whether i liked it or not . 
  is that movie really so important for scottish people ? 
  thank you for your answer . 
  so hope for the better with the independence . 
  i was about to comment something more meaningful but i realised that i do n't really know that much about scottish politics and everything i wrote sounded horrible platitudes . 
  one question : ca n't scottish government already do something for glasgow ? 
  yes indeed . 
  i have slightly abnormal colour vision and the map i was looking at the time was quite small , so i did n't see the dundee . 
  at least there wo n't be any confusion of which country the song is about .
