  is there a reason why only around glasgow majority of people voted for the independence ( votes from highlands has not been declared yet ) ? 
  edit : thank you all for your answers . 
  personally i did n't really have a strong opinion for or against the scottish independence , but then again - i 'm not scottish , hope to visit there someday . 
  i do find it somewhat amusing how strongly some non-scottish are taking the results . 
  muahahaha , as if you can fight against loneliness and depression !, 
   when they thought russia had invaded georgia the us state surely you must be joking ? 
  belarus means white russia in belarusian , i believe . 
  it 's quite common to translate the name of belarus ( white russia ) in other languages , like valko-ven\u00e4j\u00e4 in finnish and vitryssland in swedish . 
  my german is almost non-existent but did the presenter say that finlandia was our national hymn when we were grand duchy ? 
  and the translation seems a bit odd . 
  well ... vesuvius is going to take care of that eventually . 
  probably the [ finlandia hymn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandia_hymn ) which is a sung part of the [ finlandia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandia ) . 
  [ the hymn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3jj0vdln-u ) edit : [ finlandia by jean sibelius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ), 
  because we are so spread out . 
  you can not get to everywhere with a train and worst of all even if you can get close by a train there probably is not any commuter service from the train station to your final destination . 
  one reason might also be the fact that only in the [ greater helsinki area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_helsinki ) there is truly working local train service . 
  in the other regional centres they use busses . 
  i would say that we know of them and the fact that they are dying languages , but do n't really know them except karelians . 
  pity then that the map has wrong ( old ) one . 
  [ here is the current ] ( http://c5x3acci.c5.suncomet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/haka_uusi.png ) . 
  funny , i always thought that italian sounded angry and aggressive but you reminded me of [ a narrator voice in a movie called hamam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8nv1f6nt-0 ) and that voice is really lovely . 
  when i saw the movie i almost forgot to read the subtitles because the voice sounded so good . 
  italian is one language that finns can find easy to pronounce and italian songs have been popular in finland , [ some sung even by our local artists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk0eotmrdte ) . 
  one thing that i do n't understand is that what do you have against [ minge , lithuania ] ( http://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/minija_%28ming%c4%97%29 ) ? 
  `` we known that italian is the language of love , well just , because it is '' interesting . 
  i 've always thought that french was language of love , not italian . 
  is this common belief ? 
  i have had a pleasure of speaking on the phone with someone from n\u00e4rpes . 
  at that time i at least had a some sort of a working knowledge of swedish but i could not understand what the caller said . 
  so ... totally out of the question . 
  would it be totally out of the question that moldova would let transnistria go ? 
  i do n't know - you could take the queen as your head of state and have a proper parliamentary system . 
  the united kingdoms of america does have a nice ring to it , does it not ? 
   human rights violator that doesnt speak portuguese of which country are you referring to ? 
  i 'm sure you can see the next mountain range , like you can see the alps from the pyrenees . 
  i would mind flooding if it was that bad but there was also [ this picture ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gjgkbmd21y/ump6qkxybmi/aaaaaaaaagm/ncn1dnmb00g/s1600/image-728362.jpg ) , now that does look wonderful . 
  walking around in a foggy morning - that would be really nice . 
  goddammit - you got me :d for a second i was wondering where the hell does denmark have over a half kilometre vertical drop ... 
  out of curiosity i made google image search ` venice in winter ' . 
  [ does not look that wonderful ] ( http://blog.venezialodging.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/venicewinter.jpg ) . 
  rather , i do n't know , wet ... 
  it might but then again i would like other countries to take us seriously , so no . 
  new polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  should n't it be sj\u00f6landj\u00e4vel - somehow mixture of english and swedish just does not feel right ... 
  not sure about the name baltica though . 
  reminds too much of a name for a ferry . 
  because president is the head of state but prime minister is the head of government and is more powerful than president . 
  same thing with austria and germany - those are pictures of the bundeskanzlers not the presidents . 
  names of objects are not nouns in english ? 
  nice pictures . 
  we had something similar , although nothing so extensive , only a railway tracks from main railway station to the harbour which has been converted to a pedestrian and cycle route . 
  some pictures : [ 1 ] ( http://www.hidden-helsinki.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/baana_helsinki_tourism-16.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.velomobilforum.de/forum/index.php?attachments/baana-jpg.68769/ ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.hidden-helsinki.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/baana_helsinki_tourism-11.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( http://www.hidden-helsinki.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/baana_helsinki_tourism-23.jpg ) [ 5 ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/12963/normal_baana.jpg ) [ 6 ] ( http://www.domnik.net/photos/kuvia/000/big/004/13-baana.jpg ) it used to look like this : [ picture taken roughly from the same place as the picture number 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/helsingin_satamarata.jpg ) . 
  i thought that i was going to see [ this clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfev7zqocke ) . 
  could you translate the slogan at the end of the video ? 
  i 've seen the silver throne and it looked like it would break into pieces if someone would try to sit on it . 
  but it looks nice . 
  i like the fact that it is not gilded , it makes it look a bit different and not so ordinary ( if thrones can look ordinary in the first place ) . 
  [ the throne of his imperial majesty grand prince of finland ] ( http://sissitravel.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_9216.jpg ) for obvious reasons it has n't been in use for almost a hundred years . 
  go against protestant work ethics ? 
  never !, 
  f\u00f6\u00f6ni or as it is called officially : hiustenkuivain but usually just f\u00f6\u00f6ni . 
  there are few that come to my mind : [ heteka ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/steel_bed_heteka.jpg ) for all that type of steel beds as the one in the picture . 
  the name comes from ** he ** lsingin ** te ** r\u00e4shuone ** ka ** lutehdas oy ( steel furniture factory of helsinki ltd ) . 
  superloni for [ foam rubber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foam_rubber ) styroksi for [ polystyrene ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polystyrene ) sinitarra for [ blu-tack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blu-tack ) , the brand name is [ sini-tarra ] ( http://www.kauppakartano.com/tuotekuvat/alkup/kiinnitystarrat/tar-b11-kiinnitystarra-bostik-sinitarra-60g-0.jpg ) . 
  there must be other as well . 
  finally high school swedish has its use . 
  rakkaus is serious business . 
  a word like ` love ' is too soft to describe it . 
  but how can you have snow in those temperatures ? 
  winter is nothing without snow . 
  and hot chocolate when it is +30 degrees celsius , nonononono - that wo n't do !, 
  well if it is any consolation we had nude people on our notes between 1922 and 1941 . 
  [ 500 marks ] ( http://www.finmani.fi/webroot/vilkas03/shops/20120607-11092-116635-1/50fa/5f67/96fb/e000/a3ff/0a28/1005/b4bb/img_0026.jpg ) [ 1000 marks ] ( http://www.finmani.fi/webroot/vilkas03/shops/20120607-11092-116635-1/50f9/9e39/3e8a/1caf/5b02/0a28/1005/db7b/img_0033.jpg ), 
  so you did , somehow i managed not to read that part , sorry . 
  nope , just helsinki which does n't mean anything in finnish as it comes from swedish . 
  but in swedish you 'll get your sticked-together word helsingfors  - fors meaning rapids and helsing that has many theories what it means : a narrow strip of land [ hals ] , a place in sweden where the settlers came [ h\u00e4lsingland ] and some other ones but nobody knows for sure . 
  really impressive !, 
  i could n't do half of those like that . 
  was n't cardiff capital of wales or was it only the biggest city ? 
  well ... they are basically the same . 
  quiz over . 
  you scored 141 out of 141 . 
  your score is 100 % . 
  those were quite impressive stones in the pictures i must say . 
  i was surprised about the netherlands myself . 
  seems odd that more people are moving out of the netherlands than in . 
  and i wonder how much the eu institutions explain the net gain in belgium . 
   dramating a bit like [ the folketing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folketing ) but with more drama ? 
  joking aside , us joining nato might be or might not be a dramatic thing in finland - who knows what the future holds for us . 
  i personally do n't have strong feelings or opinions about nato , for or against . 
   unless something really dramatic happens , there 's no need to use that option . 
  except of course that if something really dramatic were to happen then it might be too late to join . 
  no surprises for finland , except in \u00c5land and i have a feeling that coastal area is the one that rises the average life expectancy in the western finland and in inland it is closer to their eastern neighbours . 
  icelander is responsible for the funds . 
  can not think anything for danes . 
  thinks sweden is irrelevant , likes norway . 
  you 're a dane !, 
  to be honest i would n't name a girl as v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen . 
  after all it was name of an old man in our mythology . 
  and all that time it never occurred to you that you had your map upside down ?
