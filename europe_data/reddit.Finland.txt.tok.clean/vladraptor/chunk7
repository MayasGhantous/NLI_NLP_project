  a nordic dream realised !, 
  on more serious note , i 'm surprised that population data is not public domain in sweden . 
  i was thinking about that iceland has somewhat strict law considering names and that is why i was wondering whether one could end up having a name thor odinsson . 
  in finland it depends on the god , i would say . 
  we have a board that can overrule parents decision if the child 's name goes against finnish naming convention , can cause trouble for the child , you are trying to give a boys name to a girl or vice versa . 
  so you can name your child after a god , like tapio ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tapio_ ( spirit ) but the board would probably overrule you if you tried to name your child after hades , the king of the underworld in the greek mythology . 
  by the way , according to the [ population register centre ] ( http://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/nimipalvelu/default.asp?l=3 ) in finland there are or has been : 172 odins 473 thors a few thor ( s ) sons no odin ( s ) sons and 137751 male and less than 15 female tapios edit : and i give up trying to link that wikipedia article properly , damn you links with parentheses . 
  and as / u/darkiuna / pointed out - his name already is thor . 
  was n't thinking , really . 
  it would seem , to me , as a bad joke if a man named odin would name his son thor . 
  indeed , i can be a quite [ puusilm\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/puusilm%c3%a4 ) sometimes :d, 
  are you allowed to give names of gods to your children in iceland ? 
  there seems to be a slight error with the title of that set : `` unesco world natural heritage sites of europe '' was your intent to list all cultural heritage sites in the country or just an example of a one ? 
  is great dane a norwegian dog breed ? 
  i thought it was , as the name suggests , a danish one .

  in finland average mortgage loan is for 20 to 25 years . 
  i 'm guessing that most of finns will be able to pay theirs . 
  so next ~ ~ norwegian ~ ~ belarusian salmon ? 
  really ? 
  why so harsh punishment ? 
  it is nice flag , though , nicer than the official one - imho and makes sense as we call your country ` white russia ' . 
   but the politicians are scared of what , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  if population favours more relaxed abortion law then there should n't be any political backlash , right ? 
  there is no harm trying , right ? 
  idk - you could always threaten to send them some rullep\u00f6lse . 
  true - just found a news article about finland and the fact 1 in 10 finns are functionally illiterate . 
  yes you are right , i meant closer not equal to 100 %  in fact we have officially 100 % literacy rate but that is because rounding up . 
  i could n't find more exact number - only a reference that it is close to 100 % . 
  also there was a reference to a study in which it was said that 10 % of finns between 15 and 65 years of age are ~ ~ illiterate in practice ~ ~ functionally illiterate - meaning that they can read but have trouble understanding what they are reading . 
  true , still i would have guessed it to be somewhere closer to 100 than 99 percent . 
  thank you !, 
  slight drop in our achievements i see . 
  and slightly irritating layout on that report . 
  adult literacy only 99,1 % , so there are over four and half million eu citizens who can not read and write . 
  you are most welcome !,

  in 2013 our top exports were [ chemical industry products ] ( http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_kotimaankauppa_en.html#imports ) .

  forest industry exports also increased , with the exception of paper industry products . '',

  so a finnish word for skor ( keng\u00e4t ) became a swedish word for boots ?

  it does ? 
  we have many loanwords from swedish , oldest of them are from 9th century . 
  names of the spices are usually loans from swedish ( meirami/mejram , pippuri/peppar , inkiv\u00e4\u00e4ri / ingef\u00e4ra ) .
