  is it true that house of commons does not have a seat for all of its members , or is it just an urban legend ? 
  i do wonder what would the ombudsman 's offices reply be if someone would file a formal complaint . 
  yes or four naked males , full frontal , whatever floats your boat . 
  i found a reference where they say that it is one of the traditional ways of setting female statues in antiquity , a venus beautiful from behind . 
  there are five statues and the set 's name is work and future . 
  the female statue is called the future . 
  others are settler , intellectual work , faith and harvester . 
  edit : [ here are pictures for the whole set if someone is interested ] ( http://www.eskoerkkila.fi/blogi/2013/07/09/1336 ) . 
  the maltese one really looks like an airplane . 
  an interesting angel of view of helsinki . 
  usually the view in pictures is [ this one ] ( http://lukijoidenkuvat.hs.fi/attachments/orig/orig_1343902756r2quets9ipaovn3raefddn4ag6.jpg ) . 
  here 's some more : [ 1 ] ( http://ksv.hel.fi/sites/default/files/images/keskusta_ilmakuva.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.maisemanlumo.fi/wp-content/uploads/galleries/post-2543/full/mr130510_7u6a8804.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.visithelsinki.fi/sites/visithelsinki.fi/files/imagecache/main_liftup/visitor-mainimage/merellinen_helsinki_niclas_sjoblom.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( http://www.blogforphotos.com/images/hdr-in-helsinki/helsinki-kallio-hakaniemi-sunset-hdr.jpg ) , not from the market square but i liked the picture . 
  i 've seen pictures of those monuments made by vigeland in frognerparken but pictures do not do justice . 
  they were magnificent in real life . 
  nordic temperament furious , mind you . 
  i 'll take it that you do n't work for belgian tourist board ? 
  not bad , you could take a day trip with it and enjoy some scenery . 
  i like how helsinki has kept the [ same colour scheme ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fgwgx#33 ) over a hundred years . 
  they did try to change it in the late 70 's but people did n't like it . 
  [ a stamp with a picture of a tram with that `` new '' scheme ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/helsinki-tram-1979.jpg ) . 
  i do hope it has [ also this as a sound effect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un8fajxwoby ) . 
  how long does it take to travel from one end to the other ? 
  sorry , no . 
  fiat ferroviaria - part of alstom since year 2000 . 
  it 's called soft power , come and join us - you 'll get be on lists , all kinds of lists ... 
  haha , i was thinking the same - mind you , our italian dream wagons are n't exactly doing any better . 
  acela is n't it ? 
  your only high speed train so far . 
  [ here 's for hoping !, 
  ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-18170-leonardo-dicaprio-raising-glas-glmc.gif ), 
  they could by our milk and cheese too and resell it to russia . 
  you have a river running through the city , hardly a venice ... 
  `` commie blocks '' :d, 
  for similar reasons we have residential areas that [ look like this ] ( http://www.sci.fi/~olvari/tampere/vesitorni/vesitornista.jpg ) . 
  do n't mind at all . 
  speeds varies much depending on where you live . 
  we are a country that is geographically large but has few people and is sparsely populated . 
  distances can be quite long , which is a challenge when talking about internet connections and that also brings our average speed down . 
  if you live in bigger city or town you can get quite fast internet connection but if not then your options are few . 
  for example i live in helsinki innercity so [ i have a fast connection ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3674540058.png ) but my aunt lives in [ old residential area ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/vapaala,+01650+vantaa/@60.2627568,24.8246624,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x468df6e20d217077:0xa00b553b98df260 ) not that far and she gets around 8mb/s . 
  however there is a government initiative that by 2015 a minimum 100mb/s network must be within 2km from 99 % of all finnish households . 
  it is up to the residents whether they want to connect to that network or not . 
   as are a lot of glasgow 's tower blocks . 
  why so ? 
  towers are usually categorised as structures not buildings in lists like this . 
  like / u/rafner said , that is insane !, 
  and the cost of relocating all those families on top of the building cost of your parliament ... 
  you should be careful what you wish for ... , 
  this is hands down the best ' x of europe ' list !, 
  thank you too for the answer . 
  indeed i am . 
  i would have thought that a city that lives from commerce would invest in it 's internet infrastructure . 
  i 'll take your word for it , seems odd though . 
  is there difference between east and west berlin ? 
  never meant to imply that it was not a big thing , just that it was not what i would have expected . 
  thank you !, 
  off topic but is there a reason why your king was not crowned but more like appointed as a king ( if i remember correctly - i did n't watch the whole tv broadcast of it ) ? 
  was n't that building your former dictator 's pet project ? 
  and no fence around it . 
  i hope that we never become a country that has to fence off it 's parliament . 
  but , but ... you are in hamburg !, 
  a city with 1,7 million residents !, 
  how can you have so slow connection ? 
  your link is broken , unfortunately . 
  and we have them inside the main session hall . 
  and [ here is a picture ] ( http://is11.snstatic.fi/img/658/1288677312003.jpg ) of a mockup of the next set of helsinki 's metrotrains , m300 series . 
  they 'll be delivered in 2015 and 2016 . 
  me too , nordics first and then i 'll check what the estonians are doing . 
  bad at aiming ? 
  [ his brother 's keeper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmrbwciruqk ) and [ long distance love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlioytkyixm ), 
  yes , that is right , it started to really expand in 1970 's , at least according history article at webpage of the ministry of social affairs and health and its administrative sector . 
  first steps for welfare state were taken in the 1920 's and 30 's but real expansion started late 1960 's and peaked 1980 's . 
  source is unfortunately only in finnish but [ here is it translated by google ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stm.fi%2fstm%2fhistoria&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  edit : google translate is handy tool but sometimes it just fails . 
  for example the title should read from grand duchy to welfare society , not grand duchy of welfare society :d, 
  it was removed when there was an overall overhaul of our tax code . 
  i do n't know actual reasons for the removal . 
  slightly off topic but we used to have a `` spinster tax '' until 1975 . 
  if you were over 24 years old ( male or female ) and was unmarried or had no children you would have to pay 3 to 6 % tax on top of your normal income tax . 
  as norway is member of eea they have agreed to implement eu laws , they just have no say when those laws are negotiated within the eu . 
  here 's more : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area#legislation, 
  now , if it were a dane that would require some defending ... 
  never knew about those trouts , thank you for the article . 
  for those who are interested , [ here is more information about water managament and quality of water in helsinki region ] ( http://www.hsy.fi/en/waterservices/drinking_water_and_water_quality/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  i 've given up trying to guess whether we are included or not when people are talking about scandinavia , except if the writer is from nordic countries . 
  although northern parts of finland are in the scandinavian peninsula the scandinavian countries usually mean denmark , norway and sweden , as our good / u/teacupdk said . 
  they even had an idea of a single scandinavian country in the mid 19th century but that fell through when sweden refused to help denmark in their war with germany . 
  we were not part of that scandinavism movement because at that time we were a grand duchy within russian empire . 
  so when planning for holiday in copenhagen , first stop christiania and next tivoli ? 
  [ is this it ? 
  ] ( http://www.hilavitkutin.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/jeremy_reid_vuoristorata.jpg ), 
  even if all the [ nordic counties ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries ) were to establish a modern version of [ kalmar union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmar_union ) the population of it would surpass the netherlands only by 9 million people . 
  come and join us ... 
  i 've heard about this . 
  did n't you used to have regulated prices and after deregulation you did n't get cheaper taxi rides but varying quality of service and outrighteous fees ? 
  as are ours and regulated . 
  fares are set by government decree . 
  [ finnish ] ( http://www.taksiliitto.fi/files/taksiliitto/pdf/taksa_2014.pdf ) and in [ swedish ] ( http://www.taksiliitto.fi/files/taksiliitto/pdf/taksa_2014_ruotsi.pdf ) 4 \u00a7 if anyone is interested . 
  there are of course excess fares for sundays , evenings and public holidays . 
  you have a very comprehensive network of charging stations .
