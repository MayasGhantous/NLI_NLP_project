  tazing is good for your heart . 
  how practical is that since electric cars have quite limited range ? 
  should n't norway go to the danes . 
  funny thing is that schwarzenegger probably could have made his own dubbing . 
  what happens if you have a movie where there are actors that has same dubber ? 
  they all sound the same ? 
  your comment reminded me of this clip from qi : http://youtu.be/b3yyzr6el3m?t=14s, 
  mexico does n't have international conflicts and troops in other countries would be my guess . 
  estimated costs for olkiluoto 3 are [ 8.5 billion euros ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/tvo-olkiluoto-idukl6n0lx3xq20140228 ) . 
  even if you factor in the expenses of storing radioactive waste ? 
  but it is precise and you should always be precise . 
  i thought that it was christian democrats that blocked gay marriage from the agenda and ensuring stronger majority in the parliament all parties agreed that the government does not initiate legislation for gender neutral marriage . 
  there is a push for finland to adopt similar legislation as sweden has and criminalise purchase of sex . 
  last time when the law about prostitution was changed there was a compromise and at the present time it is illegal to buy from a prostitute that is victim of human trafficking or procuring . 
  procuring or pimping is and has been illegal for decades . 
  [ so this is you ?

  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  singaporean 2 . 
  english ( uk ) 3 . 
  australian our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  italian 2 . 
  spanish 3 . 
  finnish at least i wo n't be mistaken for a bloody american  edit : interesting how many of us europeans got us black vernacular / ebonics as a result . 
  i wonder why . 
  sorry , do n't quite follow your train of thought here . 
  it is actually the only swear word i do know in russian , thanks to those dash cam videos and it seems to be the quite popular word among motorists . 
  but you do shout ` blyad ! ', 
  when you are driving , do you not ? 
  so you are either like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2rzdofrcyo ) or [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvmodczovhe ) , or maybe both ? 
  i do n't especially enjoy cold and damp houses . 
  play heavy metal and burn churches . 
  i do n't find them that awkward , partly because we have these unspoken rules for sauna but as they say : to each his own . 
  nope , no sauna for me . 
  i do like it though but do n't have my own and not that into it that i would go to a public one . 
  do you eat rotten shark and odd body parts of a seal ? 
  is a native finn not drinking coffee , only tea , shocking enough for you ? 
  next thing you 'll say is that you do n't believe in demons either . 
  i do n't drink much alcohol , really dislike coffee , i can be talkative and i do n't own [ puukko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puukko ) . 
  when did sweden rape and pillage canada ? 
  so no lector like the poles , 
  my thought exactly !, 
  especially if dubbing actor 's and actor 's voices are dissimilar it would sound very weird . 
  i once had an apartment in a building that had a satellite dish and we got some german channels . 
  i used to watch some movies now and then that were dubbed and the quality was not bad . 
  however i did found it to be distracting that actors had `` wrong '' voices from what i was used to . 
  but who says the lines ? 
  dubbing actor/actress or the original ? 
  just wondering if there is sudden change of characters ' voice . 
  do you have a proper dubbing or a single person saying all the lines of all the characters . 
  it seem right to me . 
  our school systems was not that good before the peruskoulu reform and for example my father did have english classes and he can understand some english but could not in anyway hold a conversation . 
  besides older generation that did study language probably studied german not english , like [ pirkko mannola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwct9miz35y ) . 
  it is a popular language at school and it helps that their language is somewhat close to the english having similar words . 
  i was trying to find one too but could not . 
  but i thought that i might as well link the original article since i did managed to find it . 
  [ here is the original article ] ( http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2014-06-08/616261/vill-ni-vara-med-och-starta-ett-tredje-varldskrig ) in finnish daily newspaper ( in swedish ) . 
  it is said there , that he , segej markov , is president putin 's personal envoy and is officially representing him . 
  idk , probably not . 
  just too tired to come up anything else or remotely clever . 
  oh , go talk to the fox !, 
  i do n't think he , or she , is hostile nor entirely serious . 
  norwegians and their humour , you know . 
  would you settle for more autonomy instead of full independence , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  and what if i do n't really care either way , other than if you do become independent i do n't quite see you being a nordic nation even if you have historical ties with norway . 
  you would have to change the constitution of finland and for that to happen there would be : * a draft for amending the constitution approved by parliament with simple majority . 
  * a vote in the parliament and amendment shall enter into force if it receives 2/3 of the votes . 
  * between the draft and the vote there must to be an election of parliament so two consecutive parliaments must agree to change the constitution . 
  or * the current parliament can vote , by 5/6 majority , that the draft will be voted on by the same parliament ( no need to wait for parliament elections ) . 
  * for the amendment to enter into force it must again receive 2/3 of the votes . 
  for those who are interested : [ constitution of finland ] ( http://web.eduskunta.fi/resource.phx/parliament/relatedinformation/constitution.htx?lng=en ), 
  iceland occupied by denmark in 1944 ? 
  i thought they were occupied by usa and british during wwii ? 
  and slovakia occupied by czechoslovakia ? 
  i suppose that is one way to resolve problems between uk and spain over gibraltar . 
  i 've seen machines where you can choose to donate the money to a charity here in finland too but never those pantir\u00f6rs . 
  as jarvis400 said those would be really clever . 
  we have some : [ rio cola ] ( http://public.imaginer.fi/laitilan/cms/images/tuotekuvat/riocola_180x378.png ) [ olvi cola ] ( http://www.olvi.fi/n5files/?getimagen5=true&amp;folderid=286489&amp;name=dlfe-11440.jpg ) [ rainbow cola ] ( http://www.rainbow.fi/typo3temp/pics/c8f3c33338.jpg ) [ pirkka cola ] ( https://ruoka.citymarket.fi/image/products//6410405107244.jpg ) all of them are cheaper versions of coca cola and pepsi cola - all except rio cola . 
  i do n't remember it being cheaper - it comes in glass bottles or cans and only 33cl size . 
  all those others are in plastic bottles . 
  and they are made using real sugar and not that cornthingy you use . 
  a very minor correction : plastic bottles are no longer washed and reused . 
  instead the plastic in them is reused to make new bottles . 
  it changed in 2008 when bottle types where changed . 
  previously bottles were made from quite think plastic but now they are made from flimsier one . 
  as said - a very minor correction . 
  i personally think that if there is nobody that you can vote you should still go to the polling station and leave an empty ballot . 
  that sends , in my opinion , stronger message that there was no good candidates rather than not going at all ( which can be interpreted people being just lazy ) . 
  a foolish joke , sorry . 
  but it is odd that there is no data from belgium . 
  an odd translation since we do n't have to register for voting . 
  because belgians are heartless ? 
  if he was born in canada does n't that make him canadian and not eligible for president of usa ? 
  haha :d so german system is too complicated for me , with all the xs and stuff . 
  where are those kept in polling stations ? 
  inside polling booth ? 
  because if they are in the open does n't people see which party you are going to vote ? 
  this !, 
  people sometimes , quite often actually , forget this .
