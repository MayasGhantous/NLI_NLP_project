i was n't refuting that ( we agree on this otherwise ) but trying to say that the cuts made now are n't so directly connected to this . 
  there 's only 160,000 ( and counting ) more to be relocated in the relocation scheme . 
  no , this is n't about that . 
  it is an increasingly desirable destination for existing eu citizens though . 
  i think many of these cuts would have been made anyway , just perhaps not to the extent they 've been made now , and many of them were certainly already in the planning , particularly the govt 's apparent pet peeves , education & student allowance . 
  the immediate costs of the asylum seekers is n't even that huge amount of money in the total state budget ( the real costs start once they stop being asylum seekers and get resident permits etc ) but obviously it is testing the sense of justice when cuts are being made everywhere but there 's always a new extra budget for immigration . 
   btw , is n't it ironic the people with guns actually managed to end the siege ... so the guns helped somehow . 
  yes , few likely drunk handgun-armed persons with delusional rambo hero fantasies is equal to police special forces . 
  really ? 
  i ca n't tell as a finn but i 've always thought it is just a bit too dull accent . 
  for example compared to stereotypical french , spanish etc. 
  accents . 
   finnglish finglish means mixture of finnish and english , either what emigrated finns on north america ended up speaking for a while or in more modern context just normal spoken finnish with many loanwords from english that are not properly translated ( e.g. 
  techspeak ) . 
  finglish means finnish slang with many borrowed but not properly translated english words . 
  technology jargon and pop culture related words . 
  only finns themselves care about ` the horrible accent ' , which may not be a sexy accent but it is understandable . 
  the less you care how it may or may not sound like the better your speaking overall is going to be . 
  well matured ** 2-year-old ** account making its 4th comment ever . 
  i bet many can argue about that `` better '' part overall , but you better know pt uses public torrents and is probably one of the biggest targets for copyright mafia 's blackmail letters . 
   okay , sweden is largely pro-immigration and all , but as for germany , france , and britain , the people who voted for the politicians making the current decisions did not vote for this . 
  when the election is over , politicians take matters into their own hands and do what they want , believing it is justified because they 've been given the mandate to decide for the people , and defend their actions on the same basis , even if they make decisions against the majority 's will . 
  this is true , yet people often vote for the same persons again next elections . 
  i am not sure about especially france and uk , similarly to sweden this is already a decades long thing and they have their alternative parties if more people really wanted an alternative . 
  yes , but what comes to this issue only , difference is that it was barely a top agenda even for ps last elections ( if only the elections had been couple of months later ... ) , so in this case one could say voters did not know what they 're getting . 
  correction : not necessarily more ( unless it a a huge family , each child adds up nicely to the amount of montly support ... ) , but enough that it is a huge disincentive . 
  it is amazing how several decades old studies of mostly work-based western-emigration-to-western-country in a time when europe still had manufacturing factories are cited to `` prove '' that the current situation is good for economy . 
  people voted their leaders . 
  if voters put stupid people in power , that means the voters are stupid . 
  also consider that in sweden this has been going on for a lot longer that for one elections cycle , in that way not comparable to for example our country finland . 
  welcome to the current year . 
  you 're saying like it is the employers ' fault that they do n't or do n't want to learn the language or that that they get more money from social welfare than working . 
  what scenario ? 
  i do n't really see a huge connection to the current bullshit going on . 
  there 's always been smuggling even inside europe despite best measures , and much worse things than uniforms from some army outlet destined to be shipped to syria . 
  there are now claims that it was a hack after all ( and lots of conspiracy theories that it was soros & buddies all along ) . 
  and whoever did the hack or leak , should have just dumped everything to wikileaks . 
  there , it would have been free to be used by all medias . 
  then we may have even seen a competition from the media to make the biggest and juiciest revelations . 
  the point was that you or one can keep saying `` still technically low '' in future too while the more important detail is that it has risen in a short time and trend is upwards . 
  i still do n't expect to get the unfiltered truth , knowing who runs and funds this `` consortium '' . 
  only hope is that there 's going to be some conflict of interest between different countries ' medias . 
   you 're a fuckin racist idiot . 
  good , good . 
  let the hate flow through you . 
   almost exactly the same thing . 
  lol . 
  instead of apparently reading the old testament which has no use in religious context anymore just look up `` reneissance '' and `` progressive christianity '' . 
  churches reinterpreted the fucked up parts . 
  still waiting for a similar phase in islam . 
  i am an atheist . 
  so , he got the numbers wrong ( or at least another survey tells different numbers , as pew has done a lot of these ) and now we can pretend like any of those double digit numbers are n't disturbing and fucked up enough . 
  and colonization ( ( ( forgeting world 's longest running colonial master , turkey ) ) ) !, 
  that seems to be more about privacy & person register laws . 
  how is an anonymous poll ethnic registration ? 
  i believe that 's how [ statistics like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_finland#statistics ) are done . 
  there was another comment here that many other countries do not do this . 
  conspiracy stink was n't the intention . 
  this obviously in addition to where their generally stand . 
  top argument . 
  what about in the future ? 
  is 4 % , 8 % or 10 % still technically low ? 
   unlike other countries , sweden does not gather any official language statistics , since it 's seen as too close to ** ethnic registration ** . 
  this lack of official data is something parkvall finds unfortunate . 
  oh , new word instead of the usual r word . 
  they 'll just force them to learn swedish ( swedish speaking areas ) . 
  that 's why rkp is very pro-multikulti . 
  op link is about mother languages . 
  big difference . 
  english is otherwise ( most likely ) second most spoken language . 
  even the left has . 
  for them , this is a goal . 
  saying that there are westerners on the list * is different than actually listing the names . 
  \\* there is no `` list '' per se . 
  there is the original data , which we wo n't get and which may or may not be completely searched and in the end we will only know what the media outlets involved in this decides to tell us . 
  and thus we should believe all westeners ( except couple of sacrificable names , including icelandic pm ) used the other major firms or that westeners are so much smarter hiding their tracks than saudi sheiks and evil dictators using the same law firm ? 
  [ corporate media gatekeepers protect western 1 % from panama leak ] ( https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/04/corporate-media-gatekeepers-protect-western-1-from-panama-leak/ ) , former british ambassador craig murray . 
  also interesting there are no big american newspapers/medias on the `` reporting partners '' list . 
  seems to be a popular conclusion even with english material . 
  hungarian pm viktor orban . 
   douglas murray oh , him ... some great debate videos on youtube . 
  as experienced professionals they should have waited things to clear up instead of making contradictory statements . 
  besides the point ( in that scenario , the bomb would have gone off too early ) , which was the police 's contradictory statements/info just for the sake of placating people . 
  love how police already had excluded terrorism despite at the time of doing that having no clue about the identity of the driver . 
  that 's a joke that is pretty much true . 
  in public jewish religious leaders have played the anti-semitism card when defending this tradition . 
  and one could say it is also an ( north ) american tradition , regardless of person 's own roots : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_circumcision, 
  well , ever since imgur added . gifv support , i guess kind of unneeded . 
  but your point about `` content of others '' is still stupid because imgur and others are also full of reposts and copyrighted material . 
  how is that different from any other image hosting site ? 
   the last part does n't happen for refugees obviously . 
  obviously and obviously . 
  after two minutes of googling i now [ apparently ] ( http://law.stackexchange.com/a/3990 ) understand the path to citizenship path better than you do as a german yourself . 
   32k kosovar in germany in 2008 , 84k in 2009 , 100k in 2010 and 180k in 2014 . 
  quite a bit , maybe they are refugees again ? 
  googled a bit more , and apparently there has been another diaspora mostly for economic reasons . 
  nice table though , i 'd like to move goalpost a bit and ask did all those bosnians , africans and asians ( this must include middle-east ) drop from the sky or something , but you 've already twice avoided this question . 
   it 's not their choice . 
  the kosovar did n't want to leave either , we hade a huge debate back when it was time for them to leave . 
  and how do you think the merkels in europe are going to force them to return when now they `` ca n't '' even deport all of those whose applications have been rejected !?
