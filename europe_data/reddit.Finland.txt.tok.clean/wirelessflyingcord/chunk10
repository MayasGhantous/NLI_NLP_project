   at one side people want people of other ethnic grounds to fucking assimilate , but hey ( ! ), 
  do n't assimilate too much , you are still tainted by your colour . 
  and the other side is like fuck you , assimilate but do it on our terms so basically never show your face on my ads because i do n't like your skin colour or where you come from . 
  strawmen / completely irrelevant . 
  being part of society does n't magically turn his ancestry into swedish . 
   because believe it or not the boy is swedish ... who would have thought a black swedish boy exists !, 
  / s if a mouse gets born in a horse stable , does the mouse become a horse ? 
  he may be a swedish citizen , but he is not an ethnic swede . 
  when it is financed by tax payers ( public broadcasting company ) , yes , i am going to get triggered over it . 
  i 'm afraid we 're soon way past the point that one simply ca n't do that on tv , because one is going to get destroyed in the media , the mailbox is going to be full of death threats and might even get dragged into court for agitation/incitement . 
  some of the embedded tweets definitely referred to it being `` offensive '' , etc. 
   `` you are utterly abhorrent bbc . 
  you are truly sick in the head and morally bankrupt , '' added another . 
  you who are offended by every fucking satiric thing are utterly abhorrent , i added . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_army#size  during the ** 1980s the size of the army was around 180 000 soldiers ** and was slowly increased as time progressed until around 1988 . 
  the end of the cold war led to a massive restructuring of the swedish army . 
  every year after 1988 , the army discharged around 40 000 conscripts and recruited only 20 000 , so that by 1995 the size was down to 80 000 soldiers . 
  around this time the compulsory service obligation was further reduced to 10 months , reserve service became more flexible , and changes made in enforcement so that forceful enforcement became withdrawn as policy . 
  ** by 2004 the size of the swedish army was down to 60 000 ** soldiers , and ** in 2013 , three years after the end of conscription , the size was at an all-time low of just 16 000 soldiers ** , though the army *** plans to reach a level of 50 000 professional soldiers by 2020 , mostly through a large media campaigns *** .

  it is not gang violence on the city streets kind of problem and probably more of alcoholism problem than gun problem . 
  i wonder if he intented to die `` as a martyr '' but chickened out at the last minute . 
  for example the paris attackers had passports with them , obviously on purpose . 
  i agree , but at least this confirms he will not ever walk free ( even if just a theoretical chance ) and this is a tax payer friendly solution . 
  i can only hope the police officers emptied full magazines in him .

  vote count algorithms recently changed and the counts can be higher now . 
  took 5 hours , to be exact ... https://reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/5imt76/psbattle_a_picture_of_this_dog_with_the/, 
  well , the polls have usually underestimated right wing side ( brexit , trump ) so here it would be a reversed situation . 
  most people on the left are total communists though . 
  that 's a fact, 
  you did n't get it , because you just assumed the president is always legislatively the most powerful role . 
  austrian president is a ceremonial role and this election was always going to be more symbolic . 
  the parliament and chancellor ( prime minister ) have the legislative power ( btw , hofer 's party is leading polls for 2018 ) . 
  _ is your comment a joke ? _, 
  i mean generally this whole roaming law . 
  the exact price cap may become lower but it probably will still put the opposing countries ' carriers at disadvantage and drive costs up . 
  i do n't know about that , i doubt it is a regulation or anything , but that 's just the way competition has worked ( well ) . 
  there are definitely slower bandwidth plans with data caps meant for lower use . 
  there was one thing that was cheap in finland , and now eu fucked up it . 
  thanks eu . 
  any links to live vote counting pages ? 
  ( i.e. 
  showing a map , the states and percentages , etc ), 
  it is comforting to read people living in warmer climates craving for snow . 
  helps me get through months of darkness and freezing temperatures followed by a slushy spring . 
  that can be prohibited by the carrier , so it is not only that but overall this roaming law puts carriers with low prices at disadvantage with travellers . 
  same situation here in finland . 
  i think the prices have gone up a bit already . 
  perhaps the only thing ( besides broadband internet ) that can be regarded internationally cheap , and now an eu law that ironically had good intentions is going fuck it up . 
   tethering is limited to 50gb . 
  not sure how they can tell if i 'm tethering but there it is maybe by software . 
  is the phone locked to the carrier ? 
  i 've understood in us for example tethering is often completely disabled . 
  how was this comparison made ? 
  some of those numbers are oddly even numbers to be averages . 
  it almost looks like they only picked one plan from some big operator instead of comparing all major ones . 
  the carriers in the `` no limit '' and low price countries are going to raise the montly prices due to the eu roaming law . 
  the intention of that law is good , but it puts carriers in these countries at disadvantage with travellers . 
   unfortunately europeans here refused to accept the fact that turkey is the one with power here , not the eu . 
  in current climate yes , because eu leadership is so spineless . 
  financially , turkey needs eu/europe . 
  i almost hope erdogan does this already . 
  lets see if our current political `` leaders '' are scared of next year 's major elections ( france , netherlands , germany ) . 
  but the main route has been from turkey 's coast to the nearby greek islands and then to mainland greece , not directly from turkey to mainland greece . 
  by all accounts border guarding a few islands should be easier . 
   the australian model does n't work here so good because of different geography it is more the principle and analogy . 
  and the australian model would definitely apply to libya-italy route . 
   it does n't have much to do with political will . 
  lets say the deal is off . 
  if refugees crossing from turkey make it to eu territory they ca n't be returned , unless either turkey accepts them back or the eu tries to illegally cross them back over again , with both of these scenarios being unlikely here . 
  real and tough border control is about political will . 
  if every single boat was returned a la australia , turkey would have a real incentive to do something ( other than using the situation to blackmail weak eu ) . 
  always hiding behind `` because un refugee agreements '' ( when said agreements are no longer fit ) shows lack of political will . 
   once you get on eu territory as a syrian you 'll eventually get processed cause syria is not a safe country and wo n't be for the foreseeable future . 
  it is a high time to stop talking only about syria when even in [ recent un figures ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php ) the amount of syrians have dropped below 30 % . 
  ( and this is just initial registration , which means no one knows the percentage of fake identities or ffs , no identifications at all ), 
  the `` crisis '' is completely self-inflicted because decades long naive and ridiculous open ( outer eu ) border and immigration ( asylum seeker ) policy . 
  or `` ca n't be '' . 
  it is a lack of political will . 
  all balkan countries have shut the door ( funny how no one is calling them nazies anymore ) , so at least a repeat of 2015 likely would n't be possible . 
  it is it pretty much in the quote . 
   syrian mohammed ali abdula earlier told the lnk channel they thought lithuania ** was `` like germany and sweden '' but after discovering that was n't the case ** , `` it became obvious we do not want to stay . '', 
  or inferiority complex ? 
   i mean put yourself in their shoes : you are stranded in some dessert country . 
  completely different culture . . etc. 
  in the shoes of an economic migrant or a refugee ? 
  the distinction needs to be made . 
  if a person is complaining about everything instead of just happy to be alive , not being bombed and starved to death , that should ring a bell . 
  this complaining about everything shows more how the smugglers feed them lies and then they somehow feel entitled to getting everything for free and immediately . 
  in my link at least one of the interviewed ones had withdrawn the application , which means he was no longer waiting for the decision . 
  that is like some kind of tourism : just coming to check if the lies by the smugglers were true .

  average finn is n't under supposed bombing either . 
   hey guys let 's make assumptions without knowing the full story or the actual experience these people had !, 
  fun !, 
  `` experience '' ? 
  deep inside you know this is about social benefits / standard of living , no matter how low those are lithuania is not a war zone .
