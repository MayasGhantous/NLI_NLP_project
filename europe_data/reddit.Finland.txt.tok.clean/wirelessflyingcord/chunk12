  ca n't see it in the original comment i replied . 
  and after i made my first comment you brought the made up example into this yourself by quoting it . 
   and you 'd still get 9 times more germans and a comparable amount more crimes by germans rather than afghans . 
   why are you ignoring this ? 
   germans commit anywhere from 6 to 9 times more crimes than afghans , but you want to deport the afghans and not the germans . 
  that 's cherry picking and you know it . 
  all this and we 're back to square one and your only-absolute-numbers-matter whitewashing . 
  lets look at the link posted earlier : http://www.salzburg24.at/detail/4952601  _ a total of 270,160 suspects were identified by the police in the previous year . 
  60.9 percent and 164.609 were austrians , 39.1 percent were foreigners . 
  of these , 22,289 were asylum seekers . 
  the bottom line is that 8.6 per cent of the accused are asylum seekers . _  _ the total nationality of the foreign offenders identified was 11,021 romanians , followed by 9,724 germans and 9,557 serbs . 
  afghans - leading nationality among suspected asylum seekers - end up in fifth place in the top ten ranking of 5,973 accused . _ german population [ in january 2016 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_austria#immigration ) : 176,463 = 2.7 % of total population , 3.5 % of crime suspects afghan population was 35,618 , which probably does n't include all of the asylum seekers but no matter how you calculate the total population even if by adding _ all _ the afghan asylum seekers since 2015 the disparity would be multiple times greater with 2.2 % of suspects . 
  another takeaway from that : 8.6 % of all suspects asylum seekers . 
  that 's quite a lot more than the percentage of asylum seekers of the whole population , but definitely nothing to see here because austrians themselves ( 81 % of population ) still commit more crime in absolute numbers !, 
  ( = your braindead logic . ), 
   you 're ignoring figures from your own research cases and you expect me to change the topic ? 
  too incomprehensible question . 
   why are you ignoring the fact that germans commit far more crimes in austria than afghans ? 
  i 'm wo n't answer your flawed question based on your false interpretation of ths stats , other than admitting that these numbers mean that germans ' crime rate would be higher than native austrians ' , but about right relative to the size of their population , unlike afghans ' . 
  the real question is why do you keep ignoring the proportionality ? 
   everyone is innocent until proven guilty . 
   your point is invalid because not even the police is making it and they have all the data . 
  maybe next time google [ what the word means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminology ) before just typing random sentences . 
  whether someone is guilty is n't up to crimonology studies . 
   you 're desperately grasping for straws . 
  very ironic coming from you . 
   i know exactly what it means . 
  it means you 're ignoring the large number of crimes committed by germans and others while focusing on the small number of crimes committed by afghans . 
  ok , so you know , but you still refuse to accept is is more meaningful in cime prevention than absolute numbers . 
  do you compare countries ' total crime rates in absolute numbers too instead of per capita ? 
   if 10 afghans live on your street and 5 of them commit a crime together , you ca n't say that 50 % of afghan migrants commit crimes because the sample size is too small . 
  this was a made up example ( [ original comment by another user ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nfv5t/ive_worked_with_refugees_for_decades_europes/dkbnapc/ ) ) just to make the point clear to you . 
  so , actually , there is no sample size at all . 
  it was only about 100 germans and 10 afghans , in _ a _ country . 
  go ahead then and three zeros to the figures then . 
  now we have a bigger sample size . 
  your next excuse , please . 
  i gave you a much better example which was also based on real statistics ( rounded up percentages , sexual crimes in finland , 2015 ) , but looks like you `` forgot '' to address that one . 
  yeah , you still do n't get it . 
  criminology cares less about absolute numbers . 
  the part you still do n't get is that the proportionality means in relation to size of the population or ethnic/other group . 
  from this one can then get the crime rate , which can be compared to native level . 
  and in this example it is higher than natives . 
  in this example the right amount of crime cases for the afghans would 5.4 instead of 7 . 
  that is exactly proportional to the afghan population . 
  this example was bad though , because the reality is often even more unproportional . 
  better example : lets say a country has 5 % population with foreign nationalities , from which 2 % are from mena countries . 
  yet these 2 % somehow end up committing more than 10 % of all sexual crimes , which makes their crime rate multiple times higher than the native people 's level . 
  now , which group has a bigger sexual crime problem , these 2 % or the natives ? 
  ( i did n't even make these figures up , this is basically how my country 's sexual crime stats look like with only nationality taken into account , not ethnicity . ), 
  that be nice , but when the standard conviction is some pathetic suspended sentence , deportation seems like is a bigger punishment . 
  he is not contradicting himself . 
  you just still do n't understand or you just pretend not to understand the difference between relative and absolute in statistics . 
  complicated as in complicated to explain . 
  that does n't seem to be in the minds of politicians much these days . 
   we will never have peace until this sick ideology is not completely destroyed just like nazism was or isis ( the latter is in process of getting it 's butt kicked ) . 
  isis is an organisation , not an ideology . 
  you can wipe the organisation but ideology will remain . 
  5 min googling will tell you enough . 
  the yugoslav wars themselves are a lot more complicated matter . 
  5-hour bbc doc : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dds9m7osvog, 
   turkish pretty bad typo ( you mean armenian ... committed by ottomans/turks ) . 
  at which point overpopulation become such a taboo ? 
  as if it got dropped from the world problems list . 
  now there is instead much talk about environmental migration already and how `` nothing can be done about it '' . 
  the reality did n't match the picture the smugglers painted back in 2015 . 
  too slow and hard asylum process ( especially since more than half of all applications came from iraqis , which has been since deemed as a safe country ) , so no instant and secured route to welfare after all . 
  the cold winter probably sucks too . 
  the government may have tried to follow sweden 's great example but i think the actual citizens were never as receptive except of course for the loud minority on the political left . 
  since these have completely vanished from the `` system '' ... some may have remained as illegals but i have to believe ( hope ) that the most of these 5000 have left the country a long time ago , some likely even before they got their first asylum decision and either returned to iraq or re-applying in another country . 
  in any case if they 've left , they 're no longer our problem . 
  i think this is what was supposed to happen ( eurodac is the fingerprint system ) , but i 'm really doubtful it did happen all the time . 
  however still out of 40 000 applications 3000 were found to be dublin cases [ since 2015 ] ( http://tilastot.migri.fi/#decisions/23330?start=540 ) ( dublin case = registered previously in another country ) . 
  another 7000 applications have expired , so these missing ones probably overlap with that too . 
  most of them were likely iraqis ( half of all applications since 2015 ) and most of them have probably left the country long time ago . 
  it is like the best-case-scenario : no need to even deport them . 
  this figure probably overlaps with the 7000 + `` expired '' applications and 4000 + invalid applications ( dublin etc. 
  cases ) [ since 2015 ] ( http://tilastot.migri.fi/#decisions/23330?start=540 ) . 
  what are all the other type of crimes included in `` all '' ? 
  here 's again that religious leader , who no longer cares about preserving the his own religion and who demands disbanding states and opening borders while yelling from his ivory tower in the most gated state in the world . 
  he can go choke on a child-sized dildo . 
  of course , but this is the way they can get a rerun and abuse the system even more . 
  and in case of eritreans like in this story the positive decision percentage ( asylum or subsidiary protection ) is probably very high in all countries ( e.g. 
  in my country exactly 100 % , 500 + decisions in total ) , since eritrea is regarded as an unsafe country . 
  that 's the idea , do they though in practice ? 
  that 's a great success rate out of all western countries . 
  two things separate us and canada from eu : * cherry-picked refugees only from un programs/camps . 
  no uncontrolled mass immigration where no one has a clue who is crossing border ( s ) . 
  * less welfare state socialism : lower benefits and they 're not endless , which forces people to assimilate . 
  european solution seems to be to just have more of the latter one and blame all failures on racism and xenophobia . 
  economic reasons are n't `` persecution '' . 
  or they just drop their ids if they ever had ones in the first place . 
  if no fingerprints were never taken and put to the eu-wide system then then germany will never know . 
  i 'm not talking about italy alone here , but the whole eu . 
  i know about that european court of human rights verdict from 2009 after italy send some people back but eu probably is n't going to sanction itself , in the unlikely case that it magically grows some balls first . 
  like un or the rest of the world is going to isolate and sanction the whole continent . 
  international law is only law as long as certain amount of powerful enough countries agree to follow it . 
  it is not like _ not _ signing the agreement would make much difference considering how eu is soon going to force czech , poland , hungary etc. 
  to obey the agreement they did n't sign . 
   naturally has to respect international law naturally .
