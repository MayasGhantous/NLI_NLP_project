  a search box algorightm was just one line formula . 
  it a huge chunk of code . 
  search engine provider could try to explain what it does , but they would have to give benefit of the doubt . 
  and after a month they have already rewritten it . 
  it is more about `` hate speech '' being a trojan horse , a bit like piracy has always been , to then continue censoring other things with the same technique/technology/policy . 
  cuts and shittening of the school year plans ( less math , more bullshit ) and generally economy is n't getting better and is going to hit hard at families . 
  this is about elementary school , but higher education is also crumbling . 
   adding up the numbers means one can make a rough guess on the population of asylum seekers in finland and , with the statistic , taking a look at how common/likely sexual offences are in that population . 
  ( in relativity to the general population of finland ) i see . 
  amount of people with asylum seeker status is 22 000 ( police/october ) . 
  nationalities : http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html#9 ( in english ) [ foreign background ] ( http://www.stat.fi/til/vaerak/2015/01/vaerak_2015_01_2016-09-23_tie_001_en.html ) or [ by language ( note : swedish is 2nd official language ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_finland#ethnic_minorities_.26_languages ) ( in english ) . 
   but not at relativity to the general size of population . 
  so while africans and people from the middle east are more likely to commit sexual offences and crimes , they also make up a much smaller part of the population than estonians or russians . 
  [ the graph ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/152441/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf#page=41 ) is proportional to the size of the ethnic group ( i did n't explaint this though , i only said `` crime level '' ... ) . 
  the level of native finns in that picture is 1.0 and rest are compared to that ( in case you 're curious , the one group below 1.0 is swedish-speaking finns . 
  and the one on the bottom is `` other european ( non-eu ) countries '' ) . 
  this is the best way to look at this . 
  i do n't get what you 're trying to do with that math ... 
  this article is about all foreigners , and asylum seekers are just a subset of that . 
  the other study i linked looks at ethnicity ( and separates 1st and 2nd generation too ) and not just foreigner vs. finnish nationality status . 
  it is also based on older data . 
  this specifically refers to reporting of sexual harrassment , because it only became a criminal offence in 2014 and the explanation here means that people would report it now more likely because in the past they did n't know they could report it . 
  that still does n't explain the overpresentation of foreigners . 
  no surprise that our public broadcaster yle wanted to spin this in a bit vague way . 
   a likely cause as well as plenty of russian and estonian nationals commiting such crimes . 
  not according to a study from 2014 ( [ posted it here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59gkrg/foreign_nationals_suspects_in_onefifth_of_sexual/d9903b8/ ) ) . 
  slightly higher rape crime level than native people , but nothing compared to the obvious overpresentation of north african and middle eastern people . 
  this specificallly refers to sexual harrassment reports , which only became a criminal offence in 2014 and the explanation here means that people would report now more likely because in the past they did n't know they could report it . 
  that still does n't explain the overpresentation of foreigners . 
   and that makes rape less rape-y ? 
  no , but one imoportant difference is that the between-the-acquaintances rapes do not form a public safety concern vs. bush rapes by strangers . 
  there 's this `` immigrants as crime victims and offenders in finland '' study from 2014 which looks at ethnicity too ( and backups what you said ) . 
  https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/152441 ( [ specific page ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/152441/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf#page=41 ) ) translations of the main points : - all immigrants ' rape crime level ( in proportion to the population ) was x8 compared to native people - people of african or middle east origin : x17 compared to native people - born in finland but with immigrant parents : x6 compared to native people - after adjusting this to sociademographic/economic factors for african and middle eastern immigrants rape crime level was still x10 compared to native people, 
  some were questioning the validity of the study since the full one could n't be googled . 
  here is one by respected pew research about american muslims and percentages are similarly alarming : http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-app-a/  more than eight-in-ten american muslims say suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets are ** never justified ( 81 % ) ** or rarely justified ( 5 % ) to defend islam from its enemies . 
  ... just 1 % of u.s. muslims and a median of 3 % of muslims worldwide say suicide bombings and other violence against civilian targets are often justified , while 7 % of u.s. muslims and a global median of 8 % of muslims say such attacks are sometimes justified to defend islam . 
  you 're doing some twisting yourself too . 
  lets put this into a context : if only 4/5 western natives were against far-left/right violence , that would sound pretty fucked up , no ? 
  again , you seem to know more than the prosecutor , as you seem to already know whether this was planned or not . 
  effectiveness is irrelevant , since many other variables affects that . 
  here it was likely ineffective only thanks to quick response by other police officers and a lack of a more powerful weapon . 
  the only difference between `` effective '' and `` ineffective '' in the ansbach bombing was that he bomber 's access to the nearby music festival was denied . 
  was the nice attacker a terrorist or not ? 
  ( lone wolf lunatic , planned , very effective . ), 
  if `` no '' to above : was anders breivik a terrorist or not ? 
  ( lone wolf lunatic , planned , very effective . ), 
  good that you have better information than the prosecutor . 
   belgian media report that hicham d is known to belgian police and is believed to have links to jihadists who travelled to syria to fight . 
  he also served as a belgian army officer until 2009 . 
   `` we have reason to believe that the incident was a terrorist attack , '' a spokesman for the belgian federal prosecutor 's office , eric van der sypt , said . 
  it think it already did . 
  i have a dream . 
  what was your point then ? 
  it looks like you were saying this would n't be news if the victim was non-white especially if the perps were white . 
  the other way though ... media radio silence . 
  but the perps are most likely white chavs . 
  there is some hunting culture ( with guns ) , but take that movie as fantasy . 
   risks being drafted . 
  this brings up the question whether in principle draft evasion is a legit reason to become an asylum seeker in the first place . 
   logistical issue as turkey would not want to cooperate . 
  there is also lack of will to force turkey to cooperate . 
  i think in most countries syrians ( or `` syrians '' who coincidentally lost their id papers ) close to all ( like literally 98 % ) get positive decicions aka asylums or other temporary residence permits ( which eventually as years go by become permanent ) . 
  clearly majority of these will never return . 
  indeed it is ironic a person 's application can be rejected yet origin country is deemed as too unsafe to deport , but i guess deportation after the war is over is the point here . 
  his application was denied , so it was no longer being processed . 
  however , because syria is deemed as unsafe * country so he was n't going to deported anyway but was instead granted some form of a temporary right to say in germany . 
  these persons stay in some housing meant for them only . 
  definitely not locked in though . 
  \\* this is stupid . 
  i am very aware of the scale of war , but i am also aware the government controlled coast and kurdish controlled north are relatively safe . 
   my uncle joined a cult at 18 that later ended up killing him . 
  so a suicide ? 
  he did n't try to take anyone else with him ? 
  see the difference ? 
  ( in case edit of my first reply was too slow : he reportedly had attempted to get into the nearby music festival but was turned away , which sounds like a pretty obvious plan )  i 'm not giving anyone a pass for anything and saying anyone has a right or justification for killing people . 
  i 'm saying that in cases of mental illness we ca n't just start screaming racist shit and getting elections about the fact a pesky brown person we did n't want to let in behaved in a bad way so now we 've got justification to act like shit heads towards other people of the same , regardless of whether ot not they have anything to do with one another . 
  what many anti-immigration people really want are actual security at the outer eu borders , toughening of the utterly naive asulym application process and dismissal of obvious economic migrants , because european welware is n't a worldwide human right . 
  if this is n't good enough living condition for those who already are settled in the country , then they 're free to leave . 
  unfortunately the current elite & left refuses to do shit , which will eventually fuel far more far-right solutions . 
   that 's what they have been recently . 
   non religious sick people ( sometimes ) hiding behind religion . 
  the kid in munich was n't religious at all . 
  even i 'm not labelling the munich in that category but in the mass/school shooter category . 
  the other cases can very well be religously motivated and/or hate crimes . 
   the nice attacker was a violent dude who barely even went to the mosque . 
  who also planned an attack for a year and had accomplices . 
  you just ca n't give a pass for this attack in particular because of the scale of it . 
  or then you 're saying a slightly depressed just divorced finn has every right to do the same on esplanadi . 
   cults pick on people like this on purpose . 
  it 's sad . 
  but as usual nobody wants to think . 
  this thread is full of people celebrating this because they get to feel right and get to have justification for their prejudice . 
  so when we said this shit is going start happening , we we called racist xenophobic bigots and now that is is happening , we are still being called racist xenophobic bigots . 
   almost nobody wants to talk about the real issue . 
  particularly on the left pro-refugee side . 
  a direct suicide by own hand is very _ haram _ , but if one tries to kill `` infidels '' it becomes heroic martyrdom . 
  but i 'll wait for the brigade of accounts to tell me how he was just yet another non-religious mentally disturbed person . 
  edit : also :  according to herrmann the suspect -- who lived in ansbach -- had intended to disrupt the music festival , but failed to get into the event . 
  the irony of that term ... 
  either the current major parties voluntarily give up their seats or they change their policies to placate the ones who soon would n't be voting them .
