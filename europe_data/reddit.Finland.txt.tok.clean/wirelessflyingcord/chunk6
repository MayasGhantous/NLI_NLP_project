  the government has no 2/3 majority to change the constitution , so they decided to basically ignore it by issuing a law that allows them to remove/replace any member of the constititional court , increasing the number of judges required to make the court 's decision valid , changing the order of the cases ( first in first out ) and finally not respecting the court rulings despite lower courts following them . 
  some sources : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-constitution-court-iduskcn0xo2c3 https://euobserver.com/news/133337 now , your turn to churn out more smartassery . 
  good use of the word ... for balance . 
   clearly you do n't know what the fuck you are talking about either considering your claims are also unsubstantiated . 
  so are you going to refute anything i said or are you just going to repeat above ? 
  as far as i 've understood this needs a deportation agreement ( not sure about the official term ) between the countries . 
  if there is no agreement they do n't have take back _ their own citizens _ ( sounds ridiculous , does n't it ? ) . 
  for example , finland and iraq does not have a deportation agreement ( which is really great when 2/3 of the asylum seekers are iraqis , thanks previous leftard foreign minister ) , but returning people there is still possible ... ... the deportation is also only the final measure , at least here in finland many of the ones who get their asylum applications rejected `` agree '' to return to their countries `` voluntarily '' , which means police escort in a normal flight , a police escorted charter ( obviously all paid by the state ) or in best-case-scenario they leave immediately alone and pay the flight themselves . 
   that somewhere is the refugee camps . 
   simply waiting in the camps to see what happens to them next . 
  eh what . 
  they 're reception centers , in cities and towns , they 're not enclosed spaces , not supervised by the police , the asylum seekers can come and go and when the asylum application is only being processed in first phases nobody has a clue who they actually are and what they might be doing . 
  says a native speaker forgetting to use punctuation and using `` lol '' . 
  if met really released the name then it should have been much more widely reported . 
  now it was just indy and twitter rumors . 
  thank you erdogan . 
  you have sealed that turkey will not become an eu member even if some retard eu politicians and meps still have wet dreams about that . 
  thank you !, 
  interview from 2015 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwff4-yzoqc, 
  turkey and putin are n't good buddies though . 
  they 're on opposite sides in syria too . 
  what was n't covered that apparently that is mutually exclusive with `` a safe area '' . 
  tell that to the people for example in those videos . 
  you 're the first one to mention syria . 
  there 's no all out war in iraq , afganistan or pakistan , yet they form half of the people coming via turkey . 
  speaking of syria then , the government [ has always controlled the areas ( red ) in the coast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war#/media/file:syrian_civil_war_map.svg ) , the areas far away from the rebel controlled areas are largely stable , and so are the all the time enlarging kurdish-controlled areas ( yellow ) . 
  in [ some ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoo4mxt8aui ) places you would n't [ know ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2vznsqsdjw ) the country is at war . 
  so , according to you it would be better to not have any industries at all in these eastern european countries ( only due lower wages ) . 
  and apparently were are now suddenly talking about colonialism , ok . 
  the anti-eu sentiment is just pretty ironic in these few countries , particularly in poland with its agriculture , considering that they are n't net payers . 
  all of those countries are net beneficiaries . 
  that initial info was from the police/authorities . 
  it was even before the name came out . 
  anyway , now the mystery has been solved : [ arrived in 2009 from kosovo as an asylum seeker ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/several-injured-in-axe-attack-at-duesseldorf-train-station/2017/03/09/366557e8-0513-11e7-9d14-9724d48f5666_story.html ), 
  yes . 
  now the initially given `` former yugoslavia '' definitely sounds deceptive . 
  source ? 
  for the police it does n't matter what he identifies but what it says in his papers . 
  assuming there are papers . 
  and assuming he left yugoslavia in the 1990s . 
  albania was not part of yugoslavia ? 
  if he left the area when it was still officially yugoslavia , what do you think it says in his passport ? 
  this is exactly what i was implying . 
   we are probably dealing with a mentally ill person here . 
  that was n't the case last time someone used an axe near trains : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_w%c3%bcrzburg_train_attack  the state office of criminal investigations called it a terrorist attack with an islamist religious motive . 
  the attacker 's islamic state instructor `` ordered '' him `` to use an axe rather than a knife in his attack . 
  '' [ 6 ] [ 7 ] in a martyrdom video , the attacker blamed unspecified infidels trespassing against and murdering men , women and children , as well as leaders and muslim citizens who did not object to this . 
   german authorities later discovered evidence showing that ahmadzai was in contact with a suspected islamic state member in saudi arabia and had originally been asked to drive a car into a crowd of people . 
  ahmadzai declined this suggestion as he was not able to drive the car . 
  [ 15 ] instead , he told his contact that he would plan and carry out a train attack . 
  netherlands ? 
  huh ? 
  surprisingly low percentage for finland . 
  if they had also asked how much and what ( % ) the persons drank during last 30 days then i think this would look quite a bit different . 
  might look different if it was also asked how much did they drink ... 
  yes the headline is crap , but still sounds like you do n't get the idea of a `` representative '' sample . 
  1000 does n't sound like it is a lot ( pretty typical size even in big countries for `` quick '' polls like this ) , people are picked randomly but in a way that they represents the entire target group ( demographics , sosioeconomics ) , which is in this case obviously all voting age people . 
  obviously results would a lot more reliable if they asked one million people but that ca n't be done in a couple of weeks . 
  yeah because eu is now [ a country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index#democracy_index_by_country_.282016.29 ) right . 
  define `` way ahead '' . 
  everytime someone dismisses some poll _ only _ because of the sample size , it is someone who does n't know what representative sampling means . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sampling_ ( statistics ), 
  requisite : admitting mistakes . 
  alternative headline : `` less and less people believe nf is a danger to democracy . '', 
  i do n't think canadian law applies for non-canadians on a site that does n't operate from canada . 
  probably explained by the fact that finland allied ( had to ally ) with germany during wwii . 
  so did many eu leaders , assuming your `` praising '' meant diplomatically supporting legitimate government . 
  this is comical . 
  for example in finland ( full conscript ) peacekeeping and these other security operations in e.g. 
  afganistan are based on volunteers only . 
  if the law does n't explicitly forbird sending anyone overseas without consent then it does n't make it possible either , because recently there was talk about changing the law ( to fulfill the eu joint forces requirements better but not many mps liked the idea of changing , so it was probably dropped ) . 
  it did / does , but they 're not combat missions per se and probably no conscripts were forced to take part ( only professional troops / staff ) . 
  sweden is neutral , it is not even in nato and there is no eu army , so a situation where a swedish conscript would be forced to be deployed outside of sweden is pretty far fetched . 
  not much to do with defending , but either one has be mandatory because otherwise the service becomes in practice completely voluntary ( that 's not then anymore a conscription ) . 
  here in finland civilian service is always 12 months while military is 6/9/12 months , so in a way it is in purpose a less desirable choice . 
  for a small country next to actually authoritarian country ( russia ) the choice is conscription or nato or both . 
  there is simply not enough population to have enough volunteers for a fully professional army . 
  conscription usually has a non-military / civilian service as an alternative , so no one is forced to pick up a gun in peace time . 
  `` professional '' and `` conscription '' are kind of mutually exclusive . 
  yes , sweden , known for just starting wars `` somewhere '' . 
  can you place sweden on a world map or are you just retarded ? 
  in the channel there are couple of other videos too and apparently more coming . 
  sex ratio in under x age or in some age group would be much more useful . 
  which would probably paint entirely different picture of e.g. 
  sweden . 
   sure enough , when those figures are added to the existing counts of 16 - and 17-year-old boys and girls in sweden -- 103,299 and 96,524 , respectively , according to the u.s. census bureau 's international database -- you end up with a total of 121,914 males in sweden aged 16 or 17 and 99,079 females of the same age . 
  the resulting ratio is astonishing : these calculations suggest that as of the end of 2015 , there were 123 16 - and 17-year-old boys in sweden for every 100 girls of that age . 
  i was n't the one saying this 2005 study is n't valid anymore , but everytime it is brought up someone who does n't like the results comes and says it is old and no longer valid . 
  that happened in this thread too . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/krav-ny-undersokning-av-utrikesfodda-och-brott ) one of the authors says it is still valid . 
  ( another problem with this study is that it just groups _ all _ immigrants together and does n't make any difference between eu immigrants , european but non-eu immigrants and those from elsewhere . 
  similar finnish study found huge differences . ), 
   in fact , repeating studies is n't that popular . 
   should we just through away all studies older than 10 years ? 
  there wont be much science left then . 
  this is about statistics and what the statistics tell or do not tell . 
  not about some hard science . 
   do you know for a fact that this study wouldnt be possible to conduct today , or is that something you picked up from reddit ? 
  partly , it is often repeated in news stories too . 
  ( i 'm not talking about [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swedish-police-are-not-allowed-to-give-descriptions-of-alleged-criminals-so-as-not-to-sound-racist-a6810311.html ) though , i am talking about what police writes in their own so far non-public records . ),
