   that 2.5 also includes eu immigrants . 
  that 's a good point , and it probably brings down the rate a lot . 
  a similar study was conducted here in finland ( my other comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vwdfg/facts_about_migration_and_crime_in_sweden_message/de6vz66/ ) ) and it went further by splitting immigrants to groups based on country ( when large enough population ) or geographic areas . 
  mena & ( north ) africa had highest crime rates in almost all relevant crime types . 
   adjusting for socioeconomic factors is a sham by the way . 
  interestingly , this government link had this too ( nicely no actual source/reference link ) :  in a later study , researchers at stockholm university showed that the main difference in terms of criminal activity between immigrants and others in the population was due to differences in the socioeconomic conditions in which they grew up in sweden . 
  the finnish study concluded the opposite for mena and north africans . 
  perhaps this is again exactly because this swedish study just grouped all immigrants together . 
   if a group is poorly integrated then they are likely to do poorly in the economy , and be more criminal . 
  adjusting for socioeconomic status is a way to whitewash such statistics . 
  it makes the situation look better if that group is doing worse economically . 
  i do n't fully get what you mean . 
  if ( or when , like in the finnish study - [ purple and yellow bars ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmw4znx.jpg ) ) the crime rate is still considerably higher ( statistically significant ) after socioeconomic adjustment then that is even more definitive and leaves no room for the usual excuses . 
   maybe they do n't expect a change , that 's not a reason to not conduct a study , because you can only tell after conducing the study . 
   maybe they have other things to study that 's more interesting , maybe they do n't have the funding . 
  criminologists have on one job . 
  that is to study crime . 
   of course had they made a study in 2016 , they would have to use data from 2010 - 2014 or so . 
  they ca n't look into the future , you know . 
  that would be still 10-15 years newer data than the last study used . 
  this study would be more about the differences between ethnic groups / origin of countries and the crime rates vs. native swedish-born , swedish parents swedes , adjusted to the sizes of the populations , so in a bigger picture the 2015-2016 asylum seekers are not that important for this study . 
   yes , i 'm sure there 's a big conspiracy within br\u00c5 . 
  / s quite a bit more likely explanation is that such study would be impossible to conduct if the police really does not anymore fully record in this case relevant information about suspects ( ethnicity/language ) . 
  and if that 's the case , we can go back to your original question . 
  here 's a similar study from finland published in 2014 ( unfortunately in finnish ) : [ jpg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmw4znx.jpg ) , [ pdf ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/152441/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf ) , [ webpage ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/152441 ) the findings are similar . 
  mena ( middle easteners , africans , north africans , grouping varies from crime to crime ) had multiple times higher crime rates than native finns and most of the other groups . 
  assaults ( 6x higher ) , homicides ( here the smallest difference , finns murder a lot ) , rapes ( 17x higher ) , robberies ( 6x ... 11x higher ) and thefts ( 3.5 x ... 5x higher ) . 
  swedish-born finns and estonians were close in thefts , likely explained by organized gangs . 
  sexual harassment/assault only became a crime type in 2014 , so it is not in this study . 
  the study also concluded that sociodemographic reasons generally did n't alone explain the difference for immigrants of mena origin . 
  why there has been no study on immigrants & crime since 2005 ? 
  ( the bra study referenced in the gov link is the last one , but is is from 2005 and using even older data . 
  it still said immigrants were 2.5 more likely to be suspected of crime . 
  easy to see why the gov would n't like the study results . ), 
  or is it even possible to conduct such study now because police records are lets say incomplete in this case ? 
  a similar study was conducted here in finland most recently in 2014 ( data from previous years ) , and it went even further by dividing immigrants into geographic areas . 
  africans/north africans and middle easteners had still by a clear margin worst crime rates for assaults , homicides , robberies and especially rapes . 
  eastern europeans were only close in thefts . 
  the study also found that sociodemographic factors generally did n't explain the difference for mena .

   as i 've said in other comments , is there something unique about sweden which means that their immigrants are more likely to commit crime than immigrants to any other country ? 
  yes . 
  work/study-based immigration to uk/us vs. mostly so called humanitarian ( aka refugees ) immigration almost solely from 3rd world countries to sweden , and a lot of it without any kind of vetting . 
  sweden 's welfare system does n't exactly encourage assimilation either , so that is a big difference to us too . 
  from this submission 's link : _ people from foreign backgrounds are suspected of crimes more often than people from a swedish background . 
  according to the most recent study , people from foreign backgrounds are 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people born in sweden to swedish-born parents . _ i think the actual study ( unfortunately in swedish ) was posted here in the comments too . 
  after that ( 2005 ) , no similar study has been conducted in sweden . 
  why ? 
  that is a very good question , i 'm sure there nothing to hide here and now we are instead supposed to believe sweden is somehow different and an unique exception , despite neighboring nordic countries with similar societies continuing to show similarly higher-than-native crime rates for immigrants . 
  nice of you to provide facts and numbers from your ivory tower instead of just practically reposting above reply twice . 
   2005 seems like some old fucking data to be tossing around in 2017 but since : _ people from foreign backgrounds are suspected of crimes more often than people from a swedish background . 
  according to the most recent study , people from foreign backgrounds are 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people born in sweden to swedish-born parents . _ we can only wonder why there is no newer data/study . 
  that 2.5 times is a lot , especially if that 's already adjusted to socioeconomic factors . 
  i 'm actually surprised they actually included that there , even if they obfuscated it with the `` majority do not blah blah '' . 
   people from foreign backgrounds are suspected of crimes more often than people from a swedish background . 
  according to the most recent study , people from foreign backgrounds are 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people born in sweden to swedish-born parents . 
  ** in a later study , researchers at stockholm university showed that the main difference in terms of criminal activity between immigrants and others in the population was due to differences in the socioeconomic conditions ** in which they grew up in sweden . 
  this means factors such as parents ' incomes , and the social circumstances in the area in which an individual grew up . 
  nicely no source link for that study , but assuming that is true , that conclusion is interesting . 
  [ a criminology study ( 2014 ) ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/152441/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf#page=110 ) made here in finland said the opposite , that socioeconomic/sociodemographic factors do not alone explain because even after taking them into account , the higher crime rate remains statistically significant . 
   claim : `` muslims will soon be in the majority in sweden . '', 
   facts : no . 
  it is estimated that there are a few hundred thousand people in sweden whose roots are in predominantly muslim countries . 
  but this figure says nothing about how many are religious or not . 
   ** the muslim faith communities have approximately 140 000 members ** . 
  this is about 1.5 per cent of sweden 's population . 
  this is deceiving . 
  muslims usually do not officially belong to a faith community . 
  one gets a more truthful percentage by looking at mother languages . 
  they keep repeating that as if no other country used the same concept of repeated cases . 
  that does n't negate my view . 
  editor in chiefs do n't write the actual stories . 
  yes , my quote only covered students in one university , but those become `` regular reporters '' in the future . 
  they may become less radical , but pretty hard to believe they jump to the right side . 
   helsingin sanomat , while probably more neutral than the regional papers , still represents the liberal right , as is evident from its generally pro-nato stance , for instance . 
  if you want to cherrypick one subject , then i 'll cherrypick immigration and hs certainly is n't on the right on that . 
  and neither is national coalition as a party either . 
  kauppalehti ( but mostly financial news ) , verkkouutiset.fi ( official mouthpiece of national coalition ) , suomenuutiset.fi ( official mouthpiece of perussuomalaiset ) ... anything else ? 
  i am thinking this more nationally . 
  yle and hs are n't regional and without a doubt they 're the two biggest and most important medias ( besides tabloids is and il , but lets leave those out now ) . 
  journalists support left-leaning parties , and they make up the editorial staff , but somehow then the media itself ends up being right-leaning . 
  i do n't know how that 's supposed to make sense . 
  ( quick english translation : 86.4 % of all journalism students in tampere university support left-leaning parties . ), 
  that 's obviously from ps ' official mouthpiece , if that 's good enough survey then find me a better one . 
  ca n't speak for sweden specifically , but i would assume it is the same thing as in most european countries . 
  there is generally no liberal vs. conservative media split like in the us . 
  it is all-liberal . 
  i think this is an easy way to explain it . 
  many countries also have bloated public broadcasting companies , i 'm not saying the states are dictating what the say , but the adminstration-levels obviously have more direct political connections , on top of the journalists themselves being left-leaning . 
  ever heard of survey sampling ? 
  the only explanation i can come up for finland is that people are so much on the left that they do n't think left-leaning media is left _ enough _ . 
  shocking . 
  the surprise is more like that swedes are realizing and perceiving it that way . 
  i read this subconversion from the beginning and you were the one that mentioned the migrant crisis . 
  not / u/connormc1eod . 
  sweden 's open borders policy did n't start two years ago though . 
  the 2015-2016 refugees are kind of irrelevant in the big picture . 
  how about 2006-2015 ? 
  [ sex offences ] ( http://i.imgur.com/px8kdm1.png ) [ child abuse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o75ucyz.png ) https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics.html would be great if bra still carried immigrant/foreign-background information in the statistics , so you could prove there is no overpresentation of immigrants/foreigners . 
  they stopped carrying that information after 2005 .
