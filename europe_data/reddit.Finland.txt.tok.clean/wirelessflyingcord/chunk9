  the ` new rabbits ' do reproduce at much higher rate too . 
  i think you are overestimating nokia 's impact in the whole gdp big picture . 
  specifically religion is n't mentioned , but when it is done for `` other than medical reasons '' . 
  more recent highest court decision is from 2016 . 
  `` fulfills mutilation/abuse criteria , but not punishable , _ if it is beneficial for the child _ . '', 
  the case was about a muslim family . 
  any rates per ( us ) states , since in the post i originally replied you mentioned `` west coast '' . 
  [ found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5n7q64/circumcision_prevalence_around_the_world_4496x2306/ ) , looks like it is [ this one from wikipedia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/global_map_of_male_circumcision_prevalence_at_country.svg ) . 
  i meant us states though . 
  it is odd . 
  i do n't know , could be just american cultural influence . 
  apparenly for newborns it has dropped in recent years . 
   i can promise you no one in america cares if you 're cut or uncut , so no , we 're not that passionate about it . 
  this is hard to believe no where else in the west the prevalence is as high and the whole debate has been going on far longer than anywhere else . 
  perhaps the passion only comes out whenever someone decides to go against the norm ? 
   have you read through these comments ? 
  it 's like we were robbed of our childhoods , lol . 
  if this story was posted on some us-based sub i think you would see the opposite reactions . 
   p.s. 
  this is not some critique of the way europe does things ... 
  i just think some of the comments in this thread are being very overzealous over a topic so trivial . 
  it might be trivial right now , but in future it wo n't be . 
  muslim population is growing fast and we do n't want their 3rd world practices to become a norm . 
  [ map of circumcision prevalence ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/global_map_of_male_circumcision_prevalence_at_country.svg ) . 
  [ another map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vfffnpq.png ) , but less accurate percentages . 
  i think both maps mean all people , not just newborns . 
  basically , almost no one who is n't a jew or muslim ( hence , the few eastern european countries with high percentages ) gets it done at any age . 
  except for medical reasons , but that 's entirely different and the whole banning discussion is n't directed at medical reasons anyway . 
  do you have a link to stats/map showing that rate per state ? 
   it boggles my mind that such a heinous act is still performed today , when we can all agree that masturbation is a perfectly normal and acceptable component to healthy sexuality . 
  too much cultural bias and money on the table . 
   because it 's an irrelevant issue that does n't exist in europe at all . 
  wrong . 
  it did n't used to be , but 3rd world immigrants now bring their 3rd world problems with them . 
  top logic , since aap is at odds against almost all other ( western ) pediatric associations . 
  cultural bias in action . 
  too bad that the finnish highest court ( kko ) already declared years ago ( 2008 ) that circumcision for religious reasons is ok . 
  after i learned this it has been hard to eat cornflakes ( even non-kellogg 's ones ) . 
  the huge irony of your comment is that if somewhere , in us this topic is a passionate one . 
  in europe , [ pretty much no one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/global_map_of_male_circumcision_prevalence_at_country.svg ) who is n't a jew or muslim gets it done at any age ( unless it is for medical reasons ) . 
  these bans are always directed at those communities who do it for religious reasons and has no effect on most of the native people . 
  screenshot compilation circulating right now : http://i.imgur.com/mhssx4f.jpg, 
  look at the way people live there and then look at the way people live in its neighboring countries , the culture is a mix of western and middle eastern culture . 
  i do n't know why you are disputing this and demanding detailed examples . 
  not geographically close , but definitely culturally ( western influence ) . 
  which of those countries is a ) geographically close to germany b ) culturally close to germany ? 
  the physical equivalent of changing facebook profile photo into a flag . 
  i doubt this would have actually happened without the recent terrorists attacks in europe and the particularly the last one in germany . 
  suddenly it is easy see how there is now one more common thing with israel . 
  israel may be far away , but it is part of the western world culturally . 
  kind of same as if this happened in australia . 
  or did they do this everytime in the past years there was a major attack in israel ? 
  this act itself is stupid . 
  it is the equivalent of changing fb photo into a flag . 
  source is : http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5835320/map-in-the-whole-world-only-these-five-countries-escaped-european  french guiana is incorrectly labeled as part of europe due a technical issue , but make no mistake , it was colonized whatever that means . 
  this map is from [vox.com ] ( http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5835320/map-in-the-whole-world-only-these-five-countries-escaped-european ) . 
  i 'd say it more typical white/colonization guilt propaganda . 
  yeah , and totallly under european control , all of siberia and all the way to the eastern most coordinate . 
  what a stupid map in several ways . 
  the countries should be territories and split into the actual areas that were colonized at the time . 
  then this apparently tries to paint the picture that `` partial control or influence '' was almost same as colonization . 
  i ca n't help this thinking this was n't made with an agedan in mind ( `` look , _ we _ were this bad , now lets swallow half of me and africa ) . 
  edit : noticed the logo . 
  [ it is from vox.com ] ( http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5835320/map-in-the-whole-world-only-these-five-countries-escaped-european ) . 
  surprise . 
  this is based on : https://www.ebu.ch/files/live/sites/ebu/files/publications/ebu-mis%20-%20trust%20in%20media%202016.pdf which still does n't really split things the way you mean . 
  were you summarising the graph or were you saying what was normal in the 1970s should be taken as normal now too ? 
   you can actually change the odds of both . 
  i said `` greatly affect '' . 
   if you decide to avoid crowds and symbolic targets you can alter the odds of being hit by a terrorist attack just like you can alter the probability of being hit by lightning by avoiding open spaces . 
  yes , because just avoiding going outside _ when _ it is lightning is the same as generally stop living like a normal person in a populated area . 
  have you stopped going to nightclubs , boulevards and airports yet ? 
  what a retarded analogy , same as the usual `` but more people die in car accidents '' which has also been repeated here many times . 
  you can greatly affect yourself by your own choices the probability of being hit by a lightning . 
  however , you ca n't exactly just choose not to be around when a terrorist attack suddenly starts in a relatively random place at a random time . 
   question is whether terrorism has increased , or media coverage of terrorism has increased . 
  terrorism has increased . 
  increased as in number of actual attacks .

  oh , do n't you worry about them . 
  you better spend this time preparing for the many upcoming bad for you news days . 
  what kind of an argument is that ? 
  an argument that be used while things regress and until life is worse than in 1945 ? 
   you are just hilarious , tell me where i called him an ethnic swedish boy . 
  i did n't say you called him `` ethnic swedish boy '' , because you did n't , but you called him `` swedish boy '' ( twice on the same line , so it was no accident ) , which is pretty much the same thing in this context and in itself refers to ethnicity ( compare to `` swedish person '' , `` swedish man '' , `` swedish people '' etc , you were n't talking about swedish food , cars or furnitures ) . 
   you seriously lecturing me about my own fellow countrymen ? 
   i also never said being part of society turned his ancestry into swedish ancestry . 
  i never said his his biological swedishness was dependent on his assimilation , but you wanted to connect those anyway . 
   swedish is the umbrella name for exactly every swedish citizen and then comes ethnicities when you want to differentiate the different ethnicities that exists among the swedish citizens . 
  i think i understand sweden and the state of things there a little bit better again . 
   again , nowhere in my text do i ever mention ethnic swedes . 
  you intentionally or unintentionally implied it or you 're ignoring the context . 
   also lol `` european population '' part , do you consider him a part of the population of the country of origin his parents immigrated from years ago , which he probably knows nothing about other than that is where his parents lived when they were his age ? 
  i do n't , statistically , but he is not `` european '' in the same way white south africans are n't `` africans '' . 
   yea and so what ? 
  is it now a requirement to be ethnic swedish in a swedish commercial ? 
  no , but just do n't call him ethnic swedish or if you do , then admit you 're doing completely on purpose because muddling the difference suits your world view . 
   i honestly ca n't believe people like you , as if i do n't know what an ethnic swedish boy looks like . 
  considering you just called him `` swedish boy '' , twice , in a context which was about `` european population '' , i 'm not sure you do know . 
   so what should we say to this boy then . . `` oh you are black so fuck off you are n't part of our society '' .
