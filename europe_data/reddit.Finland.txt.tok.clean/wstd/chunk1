  yes , it is cloud berry . 
  a bread cheese is often served with the cloud berry jam . 
  but even more common is dip it in coffee . 
  my favorites : - with bread : emmental ( valio mustaleima ) - cooking , snack : aura blue cheese ( i love this with full bodied red wine . 
  it is great with many dishes , but especially popular it is as a pizza topping . ), 
  - with coffee , snack : [ bread cheese ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/leip%c3%a4juusto_cheese_with_cloudberry_jam.jpg ) ( leip\u00e4juusto , a finnish squeaky cheese ) ( traditionally dipped in coffee ) . 
  - with salads and bread : [ raejuusto ] ( http://vuodatus-static.vuodatus.net/g/11369/390140.jpg ) ( kinda like cottage cheese , but grains are bigger and round ) . 
  probably in few hundred years when the nazis are just a footnote in school history book . 
  i do n't connect all swastika shapes with the nazis , as it is traditional insignia in finnish art . 
  even a traditional [ christmas tart ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/joulutorttu#mediaviewer/file:joulutorttuja.jpg ) looks vaguely like swastika . 
   well that 's a neat way to limit people 's access to a tough to control media source . 
  it is also a neat way to ruin development of the businesses , services and economy .

  i feel that f-35a is way too expensive , add that our harsh climate and maintenance issues . 
  i think gripen is the best choice . 
  it is a modern , but relatively inexpensive multi-role fighter . 
  it is also designed for the nordic climate . 
   the agency further instructed that the fair must drop the word `` whisky '' from its name -- becoming just `` beer expo '' -- or the organizers would be denied alcohol permit . 
  this is the point when you realize that [ bureaucrats have way too much time on their hands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-z0tg1pfs ) ( sorry finnish only , just a hilarious tale of a real world bureaucracy in the work ) .

  [ plot summary ] ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-tunnel/ ), 
  many dogmatic churches use verses from the old testament when it fits their agenda , but ignore rest . 
  liberal churches believe that you should follow the new testament and even then you should follow jesus example when handling sinners . 
  stoning adulters is n't a right thing to do because jesus teached : `` he who is without sin among you , let him be the first to throw a stone at her '',

   i was left rather unsatisfied by how the adjustment tackles different `` spending models '' across different countries gdp itself is unsatisfactory . 
  but these figures are n't meant to be absolute truth . 
  these are good to show direction : is the economy currently expanding or contracting ? 
  high gdp corresponds with high living standards , so it is desirable to have high gdp . 
  is gdp figure an absolute truth ? 
  no , but that does n't mean it is useless .

  honestly , i have never seen natural gas heated sauna , either it is electric or wood burning . 
  while electric sauna is easy to use , i have always preferred wood burning one . 
  i do n't think lack of russian natural gas makes any difference . 
  even with all the hassle and wood chopping , a wood burning sauna is much more enjoyable . 
  a real sauna ( for me ) smells like wood , pine resin , hint of smoke and fresh birch . 
  a cold beer or two ( and grilled sausage with strong mustard ) tastes heavenly after sauna . 
  you are relaxed and warm , enjoying a light breeze of night air sitting on your patio watching a calm lake and silent forest and fiery blaze of the setting sun or beautiful dark and cold winter night sky with bright stars and faint milky way or northern lights . 
  that is heaven on earth . 
  [ finland has gigantic , largely untapped , peat resources ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peat#in_finland ) . 
  in some estimates twice the size of the north sea oil reserves . 
  the peat is not used as much we could , because importing coal and gas is cheaper . 
  but if we run any supply problems , we can always use more peat . 
  we do n't use much natural gas to heat homes directly as we prefer hot water radiators or direct electricity ( electricity is often combined with [ heat pumps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heat_pump ) ) . 
  natural gas is mostly used by [ the district heating plants ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#finland ) , which can take any fuel available ( = cheapest ) . 
  if there is no gas available , the plants just use more coal , wood or peat .

  i do n't really have an absolute favorite song . 
  there is plenty of great songs to choose from . 
  probably one of my most played songs over the years is [ j. karjalainen - villej\u00e4 lupiineja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daj2rmrraie ) . 
  currently my most played finnish song is [ eppu normaali - vuonna ' 85 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sttfo8wcrk ) and second most played [ mamba - valokuvia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxggadmweji ) . 
  one of my recent favorites is [ pekka streng - puutarhassa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flffkxnau6y ) . 
  he died of [ cancer at age of 26 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pekka_streng ) . 
  edit : i just ca n't let mention that i am also a huge fan of [ aki sirkesalo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aki_sirkesalo ) ( who died in 2004 tsunami with his family ) . 
  he was so energetic and skillful artist . 
  his death was a huge shock for me and finland . 
  it is impossible to me choose his best song , but one of most famous is [ kissanainen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0lrcd4jpps ) , in scandinavia he is better know his duet with lisa nilsson [ mysteeri/mysteriet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccbizrmslyc ) .
