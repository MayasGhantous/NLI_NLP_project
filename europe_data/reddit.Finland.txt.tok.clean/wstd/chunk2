  modern skyscrapers just do n't look good . 
  i like old school [ gothic skyscrapers ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=gothic+skyscrapers&amp;tbm=isch ) , not so much modern glass & steel skyscrapers with garish and tacky led lighting and odd shapes . 
  [ tram network does a good job expanding metro ] ( http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/fi/helsinki/hel-tram/helsinki-tram-map.png ) and you can switch between metro and trams without getting a new ticket .

  because there is n't competition around here . 
  only internet operator offering cable or any other fixed landline is sonera . 
   finland is gon na top the charts soon , they have a mission to give fiber access to all households by 2016 iirc it is n't going very well , because wireless mobile is `` good enough '' for the most people . 
  many people do n't see a reason to pay hundreds or thousands euros to get fiber connection , when you can get decent mobile connection less than 20 $ / month . 
  wireless mobile connections are developing fast . 
  current 4g lte offer reliable speeds up to 150 mbps , next generation wireless is even better . 
  the chart seems to be exactly spot on what [ i get in average ( 30 mbps down / 30 mbps up wireless 4g lte ) ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3672837321 ) here in finland . 
  i switched from unlimited 100 mbps cable to unlimited 4g lte because it was _ much _ cheaper ( 14.99 $ / month vs. 52 $ / month ) and connection is portable unlike cable . 
  between 30 mbps 4g lte vs. 100 mbps cable i have n't noticed real world difference , expect 4g lte is more reliable than cable ( i had disconnection issues couple times per day with cable , but none with 4g ) . 
  wireless mobile connections are increasingly popular in finland , because they are much cheaper , but similar or even better performance over traditional adsl / cable internet . 
  must see obscure attraction in rovaniemi : so called [ `` santa park '' or `` cave of lordi '' ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@66.652257,26.490028,3a,24.9y,351.45h,82.75t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1ssxy0ebnja9jywlr4q4pyjw!2e0 ) .

  my favorite place in helsinki . 
  [ karelian pies with egg butter ] ( http://www.food.com/recipe/karjalan-piirakka-karelian-pie-with-egg-butter-137150 ), 
  well yes , `` saksa '' comes from saxony . 
  maybe logic behind it is that in the in the early 16th century many finnish students ( among them certain [ mikael agricola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikael_agricola ) ) studied in the saxony ( wittenberg ) . 
  it was much cheaper back then . 
  10 years ago you could buy a 12 pack of cheap beer with 6.99 $ ( price includes a bottle deposit , 10 c / bottle ) . 
  now 12 bottles of cheap beer cost 9.95 $ . 
  i am not personally bothered about beer price , because i do n't drink it much and when i drink , i drink quality over quantity . 
  i do n't buy this propaganda , as clearly high alcohol tax is working : [ alcohol consumption in finland has decreased over 10 % from 2007 ] ( http://www.thl.fi/documents/10531/146911/tr09_14_kuvio.png ) and [ dui 's have decreased sharply ] ( http://hs11.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/675/1389592719740?ts=1019 ) .

  it is easy to fell in the trap that the life in the soviet union was like in the propaganda [ posters ] ( http://www.crestock.com/uploads/blog/2008/propagandaposters/17.jpg ) , [ paintings ] ( http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/pictures/9/94/94a3a3577e7ee6f2db0de5ae0cc584fd.jpg ) , photos and [ movies ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs4p2j_stalin-entrada-a-berlin-caida-de-berlin_news ) , because that is what is left . 
  it is pretty similar than the 1950s nostalgia , everyone thinks that the 1950s were like the happy days . 
  pasila construction begins 2015 ( completed 2023 ) , construction of kalasatama redi should begin soon ( first two towers will be completed in 2018 , all 8 skyscrapers will be completed by 2022 ) , keilaniemi towers also should begin soon ( as the appeals were dismissed in 2013 , which delayed the project ) .

  i am a software engineer and i do n't trust electronic voting at all . 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  electronic voting was tried in the municipal elections in 2008 ( limited in the three municipals ) . 
  it was a ( expensive ) failure . 
  traditional paper ballots work just fine . 
  do n't you mean [ useful idiots ] ( http://www.jargondatabase.com/category/political/general-politics-jargon/useful-idiots ) ? 
   also , doing internet voting like we have is n't possible in other countries . 
  what enables us to do it is ** our national id card ** and registry of residents so your internet voting ca n't be truly anonymous , because you have to use identification card to cast a vote , which in turn can be used to link your vote to your id . 
   yup , i remember reading about this myself too . 
  finland and estonia were neck-to-neck all the way until the soviets took over estonia and screwed everything up . 
  i am not sure if true . 
  [ according wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) 1938 gdp ( ppp ) per capita : * baltic countries 501 dollars * finland 913 dollars * western europe 839 dollars * eastern europe 509 dollars * germany 1126 dollars * uk 1181 dollars * soviet union 458 dollars * france 936 dollars * italy 551 dollars,

  i do n't see cars driving around hazard lights on , even the button is very prominent on dashboard , so i do n't think emergency call button would be a problem . 
   hubbles advantage comes from the lack of atmosphere and because it can keep trained on target longer , because it 's in space . 
  but that does n't counter the extreme size .

  [ i 'm sorry , i could n't resist ] ( http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wk1idexjlgyvctrwoilmuc9uyu.jpg ), 
  oil is far more easily transported and stored than gas , so replacing a supplier is much more easier . 
  software algorithm did n't get quite clear picture of your preferences . 
  you consume wine/beer about equal portions with lesser amount hard liquors . 
  result is somewhere between wine and beer . 
  thus brownish color . 
  in case of finland , answer can be either ** turku ** , ** tampere ** or ** espoo ** , depending on who you ask . 
  tampere ( manse , the manchester of finland ) , the largest urban and economic area after the capital region ( 320 000 people ) . 
  turku , a former capital of finland , and third largest urban area ( 260 000 people ) espoo , the largest city by population after helsinki . 
  espoo however is more like a subcity of helsinki . 
  it is like a collection of numerous suburbs and smaller cities . 
  many companies have their headquarters in espoo . 
   what is the socioeconomic role it plays in the affairs of the state ? 
  ( is it the only counterweight to the primary city ? ), 
  in my opinion there is no counterweight as in a form of single city to the capital region . 
  however municipalities of finland have a broad autonomy , which acts as a counterweight to the state / the capital region . 
  the provincial/regional administration in finland is relatively weak . 
   what state institutions are based in the second city ? 
  the state institutions are mostly centralized in helsinki . 
   what role did it play in your country 's history ? 
  in case of turku , it was the capital of finland 600 years and [ still bitter ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8uu0wsogk ) about losing its status to helsinki . 
  200 years later . 
   it was perhaps never considered that one pilot might deliberately lock the other out . 
  [ it has happened before ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig9le0vp1ym ) , last time before today was a [ murder-suicide just few months ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lam_mozambique_airlines_flight_470#response_and_investigation ) . 
  * on 21 december 2013 , the mozambican civil aviation institute ( instituto mo\u00e7ambicano de avia\u00e7\u00e3o civil , iacm ) head jo\u00e3o abreu presented the preliminary investigation report , according to which captain herminio dos santos fernandes had a `` clear intention '' to crash the jet and manually changed its autopilot settings . 
  the cockpit voice recorder captured several alarms going off during the descent , as well as repeated loud bangs on the door from the co-pilot , who was locked out of the cockpit until shortly before the crash . 
  that 's a huge one !, 
  great story and history behind it too .
