  in many ways france is archetype of european country , which other european countries try imitate ( their own way ) .

  * [ a typical pre-1900 's farm house ] ( http://files.kotisivukone.com/citycafe.kaakkuri.palvelee.fi/.album/1263587909217_1_large.jpg ) . 
  these houses usually contained only few rooms and most of space was devoted to a [ `` pirtti '' ] ( http://maksinharju.com/maksi/pirtti.jpg ) ( compined kitchen , livingroom and bedroom ) , because heating was provided by a single fireplace middle of the house . 
  usually only husband and wife had own private room , while children and grandparent ( s ) and other people sleep in `` pirtti '' .

  * [ 1960 's house ] ( http://media.tori.net/image/medium/46/4658755931.jpg ) , it looks pretty similar than `` rintamamiestalo '' , but is bigger and made of plastered bricks or concrete instead of wood .

  i do n't think finland has better standard of living than other nordic countries , if anything standard of living is pretty much same .

  in finland a basic unemployment benefit ( called labour market support ) is 26 $ / workday , if you have no recent work experience . 
  unemployment benefit is permament until you find a job or you do n't refuse employment procedures by employment office ( like job interviews and job offers ) . 
  unemployment benefit is paid every 20 workdays or 13 times / year . 
  thus monthly unemployment benefit is 21,5 workdays x 26 $ = 559 $ . 
  however if you have enough work experience ( 34 weeks in last 24 months ) and you are member of a unemployment fund ( membership cost about 99 $ / year , depending on fund ) you get income based unemployment benefit first 500 workdays of your unemployment . 
  income based unemployment benefit depends on your previous wage . 
  if your wage was 1500 $ , income dependent benefit is 68 % of your wage . 
  68 % is maximum , and percentage gets lower what bigger your previous wage was . 
  if you 're still unemployed after 500 days , you will still get a basic unemployment benefit . 
  if you have children , you get additional unemployment benefit : 1 children 5,06 $ / workday , 2 children 7,43 $ / workday and 3 children 9,58 $ if you go an employment course or on-the-job training you get additional 9 $ or 18 $ / workday ( 9 $ if course or job is inside or 18 $ if it is outside of predefined commuting area ) . 
  you can also get housing benefit , which is about 220-300 $ / month depending on your housing costs ( rent / condominium payment , electricity , heating , water ) . 
  how much you get , depends on your situation , for example if you are single , you get probably enough housing benefit to afford single bedroom apartment , but not larger . 
  housing benefit also does not count mortgage as a housing costs .

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact  the pact has proved to be unenforceable against big countries such as france and germany , which were its strongest promoters when it was created . 
  these countries have run `` excessive '' deficits under the pact definition for some years . 
  the reasons that larger countries have not been punished include their influence and large number of votes on the council of ministers , which must approve sanctions ; their greater resistance to `` naming and shaming '' tactics , since their electorates tend to be less concerned by their perceptions in the european union ; their weaker commitment to the euro compared to smaller states ; and the greater role of government spending in their larger and more enclosed economies . 
  the pact was further weakened in 2005 to waive france 's and germany 's violations . 
   austerity has never worked .
