  http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/580-the-legend-of-the-tsars-finger * tsar nicholas i 's glorious vision - a railway connecting st petersburg with the empire 's second city , moscow - is held back by the bickering of engineers . 
  unable to agree on the best route of the future railway line , they test the patience of the russian autocrat until it snaps . 
  in exasperation , nicholas snatches the map from the dithering technicians , grabs a ruler and draws a straight line between both cities : gentlemen , there 's your route !, 
   because the rules says , clearly , no debt relief . 
  this is impractical and stubborn stance . 
  greece has so much debt that it ca n't pay it back . 
  ever . 
  the mountain of debt hinders any hope of any kind of recovery . 
   i wonder how long it will take the finns to realise that they would have revived by now if they were n't in the euro ? 
  we already realise this . 
  majority of the finns did n't even want to join the euro . 
  which is why referendum ( which was promised ) was never held . 
   if greek leaves they wo n't be paying back the debt they ca n't pay back anyway in any meaningful time frame . 
  that money is lost , and we knew it already in 2010 . 
  i personally think that debt forgiveness to manageable level would be the best course of action , but of course the eu ca n't accept that , because moral hazard . 
   that surely does n't do any good for finland 's economy now .

  finland : there is few popular websites where you can check out apartments . 
  however the best deals are not listed these sites . 
  there is usually local brokers you should check out first . 
  there used to be plenty of rental ads on local newspapers , but now hardly anyone read them anymore ( except really old people ) . 
  also many parents buy a one room flat for their kids ( it is also a nice bonus when they graduate ) . 
  if you 're a student , there is student only housing options , which offer subsidized rent for apartments shared by two or three students . 
  ( i loved this , because effectively i got a 3 bedroom apartment for myself every summer with 200 $ / month ) .

   they are a hassle for online payment and you have to keep putting money on it all the time wut ? 
  my credit card bill is paid automatically . 
  my bank treats credit like a negative bank account ( just like they treat loans , loans are just negative bank accounts , where they add the interest and subtract the loan deduction ( loan is paid when account reaches to 0 ) . 
  loan deduction is also paid automatically ) , if there is a negative charge in my credit account , they charge the amount my current account ( which has positive charge , as all my income is paid on it ) . 
   do you never buy stuff at a market or second hand ? 
  yes and 99 % of them offer the card payment . 
  small businesses lease [ mobile payment terminals ] ( http://www.nets.eu/sitecollectionimages/75/710x325_finland/710x325_ipp350.jpg ) , which accepts most of the cards . 
  it is inexpensive and hassle free , additionally it takes automatically care of an accounting and sales reporting . 
  you can lease one even very short time , like over the weekend . 
  monthly lease is ~ 75 $ ( maybe even less in long term lease ) . 
  otherwise private persons can use bank transfers ( it is easy because of the online banks ) , your bank account usually contains some number of free of charge bank transfers / month . 
  we usually have the credit and debit in the same card . 
  people usually use debit , but they can also use credit if needed . 
  the credit card payments do n't need to be online as there is store-and-process-later arrangement . 
  you can pay your refreshments in the plane without a problem with your credit card even they do not have online connection . 
  i use cash a handful of times per year . 
  it is so much more convinient just use the card or online payments . 
  i am moving soon , so i was bit shocked to hear that the moving company only takes cash . 
  how inconvenient . 
  i do n't even pay bills manually that much , as my regular bills are paid automatically ( billing is handled electronically , so no paper bills anymore , when i do a new contract i just type some billing information in my online bank , bills are delivered electronically in the bank ) . 
  i actually enjoy that my online bank does the automatic accounting , i can check anytime how much i have spend in groceries etc. 
   a cash-free system is basically the total surveillance of everyone . 
  you ca n't escape , everyone knows what you eat , use etc , and when and where you got it . 
  what will stop this hypothetical totalitarian regime banning the cash and force everyone use electronic payments if they really want total control ? 
   in a cash-free system your only way to ` store ' money is on a bank account or similar . 
  and their online services makes up this more than enough .

  companies are increasingly using the electronic billing and people do n't send letters anymore . 
  many of their services are mandated by the law , so they ca n't even cut their costs efficiently .
