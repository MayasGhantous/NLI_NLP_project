  switzerland is n't like [ gondolin ] ( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/gondolin ) . 
  not to forget : the greeks defeated the italian attack , which strained the greek forces and placed bulk of their army against italian forces leaving rest of the borders poorly guarded . 
  germany overran them easily because the greek army was concentrated against italy .

  i have enjoyed the dawn and dusk in the recent days ( hardly distinctive with each other ) . 
  sun hardly comes over the horizon , a glowing orange ball , painting snowy landscape with beautiful colors , orange to pink and then violet . 
  it is like the sky is on fire .

  in the old times people just spent a lot of time indoors . 
  in finland the deepest winter was a lot of idle time , the summer was somewhat a busy time to prepare for the next winter ( though most of years that was n't that hard , during summer there was plenty of time to party , dance , going nearest market place / town to buy stuff etc. ) . 
  this is what typical finnish house look like back then : * http://maksinharju.com/maksi/pirtti.jpg * http://www.nba.fi/fi/image/11479/vahatuvan-pirtti.jpg people had a lot of free time in winter . 
  they spent it doing crafts , maintaining their houses , tools , livestock , gossip / talking , reading , maybe even enjoying of the fireplace ( and sauna of course ) . 
  there was lot of activities to do outside : skiing , ice fishing , hunting , visiting of neighbours at their houses ( who often were several km 's away ) , cutting trees but if temperatures were extreme , people just stayed inside .
