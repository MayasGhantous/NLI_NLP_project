  however number of the packages is small compared to the letters . 
  [ problem is this ] ( http://www.talouselama.fi/incoming/spufaw-postinkulku.jpg/binary/postinkulku.jpg ) . 
  the amount of letters is collapsing and delivering letters has been their main source of income . 
  the main reason why this is happening is the electronic billing . 
  bills are increasingly delivered directly into your online bank ( and if you want , they are paid automatically ) .

  finland is 2180 $ on the map , but the table shows net 2300 $, 
  we have n't have dictators but we had president [ kekkonen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iafw3tk.jpg ) , who was very authoritarian . 
  he was president between 1956-1982 , his third term as president was even extended without elections in 1973 using controvesial `` emergency law '' . 
  there was / is even a cult of personality . 
  i have diy 'd a cylindrical wrapper around a beer can from [ a spare sheet of thin foam plastic ] ( http://www.mitos.fi/images/stories/virtuemart/product/rakennusmuovi%20500.jpg ) and sticky tape , which i happen to had laying around after my apartment renovation . 
  worked great . 
  it keeps beer cool 30 minutes or so , even in 80 \u00b0 c. 
  i personally find mcdonald 's burgers dry as hell . 
  the main complain i hear about hesburger is their liberal use of their `` special '' mayonese sauces , however many people like their mayonese sauces ( me too !, 
  ) , but there is people who do n't like them at all . 
  i love [ hesburger 's megahampurilainen ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/5334698/thumb_600.jpg?1428572121 ) , it is a twice as large , tastier version of big mac . 
  you do n't really need to cover wood , wood conducts heat very slowly , so it is comfortable to sit without any cover . 
   but basically little foam thingies you can sit on . 
  i have small towels specifically made on this purpose . 
  also most grocery stores in finland also sell disposable seat covers which i hate . 
  i even take my towels with me when i travel . 
   now ofcourse it will create new software jobs on other hand cloud services will kill a lot of it related jobs . 
  summer 2015 was exceptionally cold . 
   280 km from the nearest town the nearest town is probably [ ivalo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivalo ) , much , much closer than 280 km . 
  i think confusion comes from that finnish does n't have a word for * town * . 
  finnish word * kaupunki * means both the town and the city . 
  and * kaupunki * is used strictly of those municipalities , which choose to call themselves so . 
  there is some fairly large municipalities in finland which are n't called * kaupunki * , such as nurmij\u00e4rvi ( pop . 
  in english language [ town means a settlement with population of 1,000-20 ,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/settlement_hierarchy ) , unlike in finnish , it has nothing to do with the local government . 
  because during the late middle ages / early modern era one of the places finnish students went to study in the university was wittenberg as finland did n't have a university back then ( first was established 1640 ) . 
  [ mikael agricola ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/mikael_agricola ) studied under martin luther in wittenberg .

  but that is how money works . 
  money is just a method of exchange goods and services without cumbersome barter transactions . 
  the trust is essential . 
  when you realize this , you realize that money itself does n't actually need an intrinsic value . 
  because there is no real need to tie value of currency to a lump of yellow metal . 
  value of currency is based on trust ( if you take this money as payment , you can trust you can use it later to buy services and goods ) . 
  it really does n't matter if exchange is made via gold coins , piece of paper or bits in the bank 's database . 
  if people trust it is good money , it will have value by itself . 
  tying currency to the gold is just extremely prohibitive and stupid . 
  yes , i know . 
  it looks very narrow and unimpressive . 
  similar to those [ old moss covered stone walls ] ( http://www.vastavalo.net/vanha-kivi-muuri-kiviaita-kiviaita-1-205223.html ) in the woods here in finland . 
   what can realistically be done any more to drop road fatalities ? 
  better roads . 
  at least in finland a common cause of fatal traffic accident is overtaking , having more [ 2 +1 roads ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2%2b1_road ) would reduce fatal accidents a lot .

  she was probably a bisexual . 
  she had many love affairs with men . 
  she even seriously proposed [ atos wirtanen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atos_wirtanen ) , but when he gave the cold shoulder , she had her first lesbian affair with vivica bandler . 
  there is no need for rivalry . 
  as i see it , tea and coffee are just like two sides of a coin . 
  they are different , but both are equally good choices . 
  that weird feeling when you realize [ your home town ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/rovaniemi ) has area almost 50 times larger than liechtenstain . 
  in finnish `` matka '' means a trip .

  alcohol consumption in finland [ has been decreased a lot in the last 10 years . 
  also moderate drinking is more common . 
  drinking without moderation is commonly frowned in these days . 
  [ traditional finnish dress ] ( http://www.nrgm.fi/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bogart-co.jpg ), 
  in 2015 there were 13.3 suicides per 100,000 people in finland . 
   i was kind of joking by the way . 
  yes , i know . 
  i just think the term needs an explanation . 
  there was n't physical punishment involved . 
  `` the punishment room '' is just an old fashioned term for the stricter , more hard imprisonment reserved for the worst criminals . 
  there was three stages of the imprisonment in the punishment room : coercion stage = prisoner was isolated from the other prisoners and the outside world . 
  coercion stage was 4 month minimum ( expect for the special reasons , such as age less than 20 or health reasons ) , but could be longer , depending on crime and behavior . 
  learning stage = prisoner was allowed to work and socialize with other prisoners during work hours , but isolated in his room during the free time and night . 
  he was allowed to write letters and receive visitors . 
  trial stage = prisoner got privileges of ordinary prisoner . 
  he was allowed to sleep with other prisoners , allowed to use common premises of the prison ( such as courtyard , gym , library , common room , shop etc. ) . 
  he earned money from the work , he was allowed to study and was offered studying opportunities . 
  which may well be the truth about it . 
  in the old times geography * was * based on personal travel experiences , generalizations and anecdotes , not comprehensive research . 
  i would smile too with these accommodations : http://imgur.com/a/ymcnt, 
  no , we just know the alcohol-related trivia well .

  i believe the difference is mostly ratio between elderly women and men .

   a right to grow up in heterosexual family environment why ? 
  this is as stupid to say as that a child should not grow up in single parent family environment . 
  are you saying homosexuals ca n't be good parents ? 
   and then make individual decision which gender he/she prefers . 
  how does having homosexual parents prohibits making an individual decision compared to having heterosexual parents ? 
  ( also , is homosexuality even a decision or just a trait ? ),

  yes , you ca n't buy 1 $ bottles of plonk in finland , but high quality wines are actually relatively cheap , because our national alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly alko is the world 's second-largest wine importer and one of the world 's major wine retailers , so they get very good contracts .
