  in average the earth is warming up and that is the fact . 
  even most of the climate change deniers do n't deny it . 
  they just argue that mankind is n't the guilty party [ i suspect they have selfish reasons to believe so : they do n't actually want make changes to their own ( wasteful ) lifestyle and just want a clean conscience to continue do nothing or continue polluting and make money ] . 
  weather ! = climate also the climate change has disrupted [ the polar vortex ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/07/13/polarvortexgraphic.png ) , which may cause exceptionally cold weather more southern latitudes , because the polar jet stream does n't act as an efficient barrier anymore .

  actually , your body gets to accustomed to wide range of temperatures . 
  after summer 5 \u00b0 c feels friggin cold us too and in spring 5 \u00b0 c feels like a heat wave . 
  it is all relative . 
  * finland supplies about 28 % ( 2011 ) of the world 's caraway production . 
  caraway cultivation is well suited to the finnish climate and latitudes , which ensure long hours of sunlight in the summer . 
  this results in fruits that contain higher levels of essential oils than those produced in other main growing areas which include canada , the netherlands , egypt , and central europe .

  not even counting all the problems solar panels as a road surface , putting solar panels flat on ground you will immediately lose 50 % energy production potential compared to optimally tilted solar panel . 
  let alone a panel which tracks the sun . 
  they could do much better just subsidizing the purchasing of solar panels , [ which , btw , are becoming increasingly affordable even without subsidies ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/price_history_of_silicon_pv_cells_since_1977.svg/2000px-price_history_of_silicon_pv_cells_since_1977.svg.png ) .

  i on other hand do n't understand people who insist that the art must have to be representative .

  actually i also use bread cheese for salads , with wine , with cloudberry jam or just eat it plain as snack ( it is also called squeaky cheese , because it squeaks when you bite it ) .

  `` the city '' is an arbitrary definition .

  after the ice-age these seals got trapped in inland lakes of finland . 
  they have evolved to live in the fresh water , opposed the salt water like most of other seal species . 
  name `` ringed seal '' comes from [ the ring pattern on their fur ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c3/f0/99/c3f099b863c26696db5bda54f60cd6ae--water-animals-the-s.jpg ) . 
  according the myth , tsar nicholas i got frustrated , because engineers were unable to decide the best route of the railroad and he was impatient to get railroad constructed , so he took a ruler and draw a straight line on map . 
  unfortunately his finger was on the way in one place , so the line had this one curve on it . 
  there is a lot of lines missing . 
  probably because purpose of the map is show the high speed lines . 
  including all lines would make it too messy .

  london is the financial capital of the world largely because of tradition ( the british empire and all that jazz ) .
