-- * france needs to make of lebanon an ally of choice in the middle east . 
  it 's the only country where french is a bit spoken , and where french presence , whether cultural , political or economical is a minimum important . 
  * * it can seem like colonialism , but having a close ally in the region cab be very positive . 
  ( i 'm notably thinking of military projection , oil , growing market , etc ) *, 
  switzerland . 
  the one nation that stands most the tests of time . 
  the fn is both ( nationalism and socialism ) , though i agree with you that being eurosceptic does n't imply being far-right . 
  in france : that you 're : - a latin country - part of the eu - your capital is bucharest, 
  a joint task force liechtenstein - san marino ? 
  he was thinking about enrolling in the luxembourg army, 
   totally not a american banker influence agent . 
  i 'm not so enthusiastic , at all ... to me it looks like new restrictions on new isps/carriers , rising the barrier to entry , and thus lowering future competition . 
   your first post in this thread that ended 10 days ago is defending the other person brigading from sss . 
  this thread was brought to my attention because of the sss post , and i would have missed it without it . 
  thus sss here allowed me to see and participate in a discussion pertinent to my interests and on a subreddit i lurk on . 
  and yes i 'm a regular lurker on this sub , and an occasional poster , as you can see from my posting history . 
   you 're not here as a / r/europe subscriber , youre here as a sss subscriber . 
  i do n't think you have the authority to tell me why i 'm here . 
  i came here as a frenchman involved in gun politics , why should i refrain from commenting and give my opinion as a european citizen ? 
  i 'm a frenchman ( reasonably pro-eu ) defending the right to bear arms , and that 's the reason i 'm involved in this discussion . 
  / r/shitstatistssay is no worse than / r/shitredditsays or even / r/subredditdrama ( in which you 're a poster ) . 
  what a reply !, 
  i find myself strongly elightened by the knowledge you provided !, 
  that 's quite the * ^ put ^ glasses ^ on * [ hungarian notation ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_notation ) . 
  * actually the pun does n't make much sense , but hey , i tried *, 
  `` two-class internet ** mandatory ** proposed '' [ citation needed ] that affirmation seems to be pure bs . 
  edit : not bs, 
  sent !, 
  i hope it gets through , 
  indeed , a failed policy can not be saved with massive subvention but through a complete rework of government . 
   i 've come to realize once and for all that the keen problem is the electorate . 
  people have the governors they deserve . 
  the problem is and has always been power . 
  people want stuff without working/paying for it , so they vote for a party that will take from others and give stuff to them , regulate everything , etc. 
  but in order to do this , the government will grow , which means more government employees , more certifications , more permits needed , etc. 
  this will concentrate what once you were free to do into a derogation-only system , where you have to pay fees , and be given a permit by officials . 
  which in turn gives the power to these administrators . 
  but these administrators are put there by the leading parties , which are elected thanks to some corporation 's money . 
  thus they will make sure to 1 . 
  regulate even more 2 . 
  give exceptions mostly to corporations that lobbied . 
  hinder small companies 4 . 
  tax enormously the citizen & entrepreneurs while continuing corporate welfare . 
  thus the n \u00b0 1 problem is the power we give to government to control our lives . 
  if you want another one from paris , france , i can do it , 
  that makes sense , high-level us universities are simply the best , so it would have been shocking to see this level of fuckery in a high level us school . 
  thanks for the input !, 
  exactly , there 's no univeral set of rules , and that 's for the best !, 
   a white only festival could be moral . 
  for instance if this `` white only '' festival were jews only . 
  or perhaps if it were `` french '' only or `` german '' only . 
  would it not be acceptable then ? 
  according to the dominant sense of morality in france : i do n't think so . 
  at least for the french only/german only festivals . 
  jews-only would be ok if it 's a religious thing , but if it 's cultural it would n't . 
  ( christian festivals are open to all ), 
  well no black people with a modicum of self-preservation would wish to go to a white-only festival , but does that make a white-only festival moral ? 
   who is suffering from this `` discrimination '' of not allowing white people -  this `` discrimination '' of not allowing white people -  `` discrimination '' of not allowing -  not allowing seriously ? 
  of course you can switch one for another : discrimination is discrimination , whoever causes it , whoever suffers from it . 
  hahahaha , my god . 
  most of the food traditionally called french food is n't that french : immigration from italy , spain along with discovery of several foods from throughout the world is what allows french food to exist . 
  imagine if you needed to be italian to make pasta for lunch ... 
  politically i 'm against those anti-discrimination laws . 
  but still , personally i would n't consider that a good thing . 
  however here what we see is the hypocrisy : i would certainly support them if they advocated for the abolition of these laws , not for a niche exception for their unique combination of black skin color and female sex . 
  a majority of the space is blocked to non-black women . 
  switch `` black '' to `` white '' and see if that makes sense to you . 
   likely about overcoming systemic racism . 
  ca n't you discuss about how to overcome these challenges with other people who do n't share the same experiences ? 
   or what if lgbt people said we did n't want straight people at a pride event ? 
  would n't it be largely understood ? 
  i would n't . 
  most french people would n't understand . 
  it 's on the streets so of course it 's open to all ...  imagine a convention only for people with disabilities - no non-disabled people allowed . 
  well that would be peculiar , certainly . 
  if it 's specifically targeted toward hearing-impeared people for example , it would certainly fly . 
  but if it 's just `` disabilities '' , anyone with mild adhd , arthritis , obesity etc. 
  would be able to come in theory . 
  it would certainly fly anyway though . 
  what the honest fuck ? 
  asking for no homework for you and your friends because of * your skin color * ? 
  in my university a large part of the student body is active in several non-profit organisations ( humanitarian aid , sports , entrepreneurship , etc. ), 
  and the * same exact work * is expected of them . 
  what ? 
  private event ! = public event . 
  wow , the portuguese passport is nicely designed !, 
  yep . 
  if people ca n't bother to say \u010cesko then they should say the czech republic, 
   `` to answer , here in france we have a median obligatory taxation of 60 % of the income . '', 
  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bar\u00e8mes_de_l%27imp\u00f4t_sur_le_revenu_en_france[1] --  median obligatory taxation of 60 % of the income . 
  that does n't mean the * imp\u00f4t sur le revenu * , it means the * imp\u00f4t sur les salaires * , as defined by the oecd , [ which gives 50 % for 2014 , ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/taxation/taxing-wages-2014/income-tax-plus-employees-and-employers-social-security-contributions_tax_wages-2014-table2-en#page1 ) without taking into account the vat , which you pay when buying things . 
   i gladly pay . 
  you do , that 's nice . 
  not everyone enjoys being forced to give their money to 60 % useful things and 40 % corruption/cronyism/administration / officials . 
   i think this is silly especially considering taxation takes care of healthcare and education . 
  france here : healthcare is n't being taken care of by taxes but by obligatory payments from your employer . 
  education comes from your taxes though . 
  -- to answer , here in france we have a median obligatory taxation of 60 % of the income . 
  that means for the average guy , 60 % of your income goes to the state . 
  ( you get some back though ) this does * not * sit well with the french now , it 's the n \u00b0 1 thing to cut back , yet the gov does n't do anything .
