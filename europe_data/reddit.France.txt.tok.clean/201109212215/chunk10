  betting you 'll be even more entertained ( may i say triggered ? ), 
  if there is no triggering . 
  hey at least there is a silver lining . 
  jus soli [ and germany does have it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli#/media/file:jus_soli_world.svg ) jus soli grants citizenship on the birth event . 
  i do n't see why it could n't be ungranted on the acting crappily event . 
  it could raise problems for people who only have that nationality , and there is a [ un convention on this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_reduction_of_statelessness ) ; but even this convention does n't see a problem for dealing with crappy persons this way :  disloyal or certain criminal conduct may limit an individual 's ability to avail the benefit of the convention, 
  congrats on germany in having the courage to do so . 
  in france there was talk of it after the nice rampage , but our politicians pussied out . 
  yet relevant today . 
  on another note , politicians who keep their promises are usually hard to come by . 
  it could be argued that all the big ones - including the utoya massacre - were about the shock of two cultures ; each murderously rejecting the other . 
  some lil amount of kebab is ok . 
  * technological progress . 
  godwin 's law is moving irl . 
  * we could start by killing turkey 's moribund eu accession process . 
  this is especially dumb , as our government cowardly allowed casuvoglu to have a meeting in metz . 
  the french government begs to differ . 
   i hope every country in the eu reacts with this level of mature solidarity . 
  our government generously offered casuvoglu asylum in metz . 
  but do n't worry , we 're having elections soon . 
  they will get replaced . 
  macron is poised to become president , and has received numerous supports from erm , . . hum errr , ahem hummm the current government . 
  kill me . 
  there is no difference with macron and the current government . 
  most of hollande 's team have already endorsed macron ; the defense minister , le drian , is feeding macron daily with briefs . 
  hollande prefered to go to the theater rather than listen to the ps debates ; they are all buddy-buddies from the ena . 
  what happened here was the government acted in a way , took the hit ; and engineered macron a noble way , perfectly opposed to the government . 
  note that macron is condemning turkey 's words , and there is absolutely no comment on allowing cavusoglu in metz . 
  what a shitshow . 
  why the fuck do we have crappy politicians ? 
  [ the opposition leader called on governments to suspend relations with netherlands ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-main-opposition-leader-calls-for-suspension-of-relations-with-netherlands.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=110705&amp;newscatid=510 ) . 
  erdogan is not the only problem in turkey . 
  i 'm not saying 100 % of turkey has extreme views . 
  but damn they 're trying hard . 
  -- why have we not yet withdrawn this moribund accession process ? 
  people say everything will be good when erdogan is gone . 
  i disagree . 
  well , our laws were made to our benefit . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with that . 
  foreign influence is really a shitty thing to be happening to one 's country . 
  and we 're about to sign up for 5 more years from the same folks . 
  different chump , same crap . 
  i 'm impatiently waiting for macron 's statement . 
  he 's pro-europe and should show solidarity , but he is also the heir of our current spineless government . 
  should be interesting . 
  ... while still entertaining the idea that turkey can be part of the eu . 
  it is high time we kill this zombie of a process . 
  jesus , what a shitshow . 
  why are we affected from problems external to the eu ? 
  [ it does correlate quite a lot with consanguineous marriages . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin_marriage#/media/file:global_prevalence_of_consanguinity.svg ) there are little differences , though . 
  turkey for example does not have polygamy being lawful . 
  this is overreach , yes . 
  they could have done it earlier , too . 
  seems like it is part of a planning to drag this on slowly to the elections ; to media milk it . 
  things in france are that all powerful decision implementers are from the ena . 
  hollande himself , and 48 % of his administration are ena . 
  it is our deep state , and has been since the 60 's . 
  and so is macron . 
  he 's their candidate . 
  so the current government sends the judges now , and the `` persecution '' fallout will go to hollande , and not macron . 
  here in / r/europe we despise erdogan for purging his administration of his opponents . 
  i wish there was something fighting to be purged in france . 
  but is long gone now ; ena has slowly creeped and cornered up our governance . 
   acknowledging the existential struggle the eu is facing due to crises over brexit , migration took them long enough, 
  pretty much . 
  from here it looks like censoring an alert raiser who wo n't abide by the rules of the candid willfully-blind dreamers . 
  i consider facts and truth to be overwhelmingly more important that not being offended by `` violent images '' . 
  we 're not children . 
  they 're not children . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  this is the establishment cracking down on an unpalatable candidate * at election time * . 
  this is what make people say : theses are not my representatives . 
  options for getting out do exist , and they are getting more appealing by the minute . 
  please do tell me more who i should vote for . 
  posting it now , as it is a better ( albeit asking not exactly the same questions ) source than [ another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ubl4m/what_europeans_think_of_a_ban_on_muslim/ ) that got a `` poll done online - see comments '' tag . 
  since you have time to ban content you do n't like here , surely you have time to go review this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qgbbe/slovenian_parliament_legalises_migrant_pushbacks/ or are you going to let it time-decay in the mod queue ? 
  it 's been one hour . 
  go do your job . 
  do n't selectively ignore it . 
  or does it lack context too ? 
  yeah , right . 
  lack of context now . 
  another bullshit reason . 
  another way to censor a topic you do n't like without stating it straightly . 
  you 're going to have to explain this `` lack of context '' . 
  there has been so fucking much dishonesty from mods about his post it is ridiculous . 
  willfully ignoring to review it x2 , finally letting it pass , only to briefly tag it , then remove the tag , to flagging it again and banning it . 
  you guys should be ashamed of yourselves . 
  ashamed to low-noise push an agenda . 
  to censor without event stating it is censorship . 
   everything is sourced , everything is supported by facts yet whenever everyone talks about the million migrants that were let in you ca n't refrain yourself from quoting it . 
  you are right on the technicalities , but you kill the arguments in an [ argumentum verbosium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proof_by_intimidation ) . 
  leading the original core discussion to these technicalities . 
  you reroute the fuckup to `` it ca n't be merkel because technicalities '' . 
  negligence to act is still a way to fuck up . 
  -- / u/ivashkin clarified things . 
  there is plausible deniability . 
  but i 'm watching you , and the selective modding .
