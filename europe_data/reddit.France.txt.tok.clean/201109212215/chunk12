   it is being left on the sidelines by donald trump , with senior advisers unable to open communication channels with the new administration . 
  there might be a silver lining in trump being elected . 
  merkel might be popular in germany , but she has an abysmal reputation everywhere else . 
  some people say she is the leader the eu needs , and they could n't be more wrong . 
  i believe there is a hierarchy , i.e that the us should be having contact first at the european level . 
  and the point of contact for europe is not and should not be merkel . 
  i 'm glad this new administration is ( accidentally ? ), 
  enacting a no contact policy with merkel for the time being . 
  if there is a terrorist attack 15 days before the election , i 'd say she has a fair shot at winning . 
  but without it i do n't think she will . 
  over the years , she has been slowly gaining some ground , though . 
  i 'd say the whole political opinion moved towards her ideas , as everyone wants to grab her voters . 
  she wo n't get elected , but she definitely has some fair amount of indirect influence . 
  yeah . 
  hopefully there is nothing left of the ps after he is done . 
  \\ + le pen . 
  so has her opinion polls . 
  so has the right wing all over europe . 
  i believe there is a middle ground , though : the eu stays , but the eu enforces strong borders , extreme vetting for legal migrants , and denies once and for all the accession to turkey . 
   majority of what you said were right thank you . 
  that was not tremendously difficult , though . 
   i never claimed that turkey deserved to be in eu in the first place oh , i 'm saying it for the other people out there . 
  --  for a random french guy that does n't have anything to do with turkey you sure like talking about turkey a lot.i think that 's the part i just do n't get . 
  indeed . 
  the thing i care about - and i 'm obsessed with it - is europe . 
  and the eu . 
  and at the moment , with what happened with the uk , turkey 's accession is a systemic risk . 
  a major pain point . 
  because if turkey ever gets in , that 's the plain and simple end of this union of 60 years . 
  i 'd be as vocal for any other risk of the same magnitude . 
  sure , some of theses sins have been seen in the eu . 
  that 's the alignment of fuckedupness that you 're forgetting to see here . 
  there are fundamentals at play in turkey which make it go the way of complete fuckedupness . 
  religion will give you the fucked up morals , and crappy political tradition . 
  crappy political tradition will get you coups . 
  as yes , there is such a thing as europe . 
  and turkey is not in it . 
  anyway , europe being fucked up or not , we do n't want you guys . 
  we prefer to stay fucked up between ourselves . 
  go back to your dear abkhazia . 
   just a flagrant power grab the simplest explanation is often the right one . 
  you got ta admire the timing , though . 
  it was right on track , and only needed a coup attempt to solidify the thing . 
  erdogan is truly a master ; the coup backfired spectacularly . 
  true . 
  time to make it official . 
  it would make for more honest politics and relations on both sides of the bosphorus . 
  how about you start by addressing any one of my 27 points ? 
  needs to be more detailed . 
  nothing in this guide about lybia , for example . 
  here is what it looks like from our point of view : * shutdown of the press * cyprus occupation and annexion claims * incursions in greek territory * kurd oppression * border claims * syrian rebels funding * armenian genocide denial * newfound russian friendliness , while being in nato * the position of women in society * lack of freedom of speech * the coup attempt * the coup purges * the previous 5 other coups ( yay for democratic tradition . 
  [ you guys even had wikipedia create a category dedicated to it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:military_coups_in_turkey ) ) * pro pedophilic rape laws being proposed to parliament * shady constitutional changes * extortion through threat of migrant flooding * spying in belgium through a religious arm * the executive power granting himself dictator-like capabilities , now we have always been strong all over europe that it would be wrong to have turkey in the union : * [ 1992-2005 : are you for or against turkish accession ?

  turkey has no place in europe , never has , never will . 
  get over it . 
  lol , sending the veiled women to do the dirty job . 
  it is very sad . 
  i am surprised to see this here . 
  has the local news ban been lifted ? 
  jesus , you 've got a crush or what ? 
  you have posted 13 times about him in the last hours . 
  no borrowing , he said . 
  hear , hear !, 
  may i ask what political color you are ? 
  because here in my country saying this permanently marks you as being a far-right extremist . 
  the only moment i can express this is through voting polls . 
  such a shame , really . 
  i 'd say i 'm center-right on all aspects except immigration . 
  oh , they 'd welcome you guys in the uk . 
  they do n't want migrants from afghanistan or mali is all . 
  the eu has had very porous borders . 
  this , and massive amounts of polish flooding the job market . 
  if extra-eu migrations had been controlled ; and intra-eu migrations had been limited to countries having a comparable standard of living , i 'm pretty positive they would not have left . 
  grandes \u00e9coles are not inherently bad . 
  a clique being formed at the top of the state is , though . 
  the ena school has long formed a state within our state . 
  48 % of ministers ' cabinets of sarkozy were ena people . 
  48 % of ministers ' cabinets of hollande were ena people . 
  jesus , he really did a trick on you . 
  lube up and bend over already . 
  / s please no porn fantasy here . 
  jesus , so much shilling for him over here . 
  he [ has been hovering around 15-20 % for a while ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_de_sondages_sur_l%27%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_fran%c3%a7aise_de_2017#janvier_2 ) . 
  there is no news here . 
  he 's a product of the system . 
  another aristocrat creep from ena . 
  ca n't wait for the election to be over . 
  there 's abysmal ( no trade agreement at all , back to being an anonymous wto member and start of another negotiation process ) deal , and there is bad deal . 
  she can walk away from a bad deal , but only to get the abysmal one . 
   he likes to pretend he is a breakthrough from the typical political class and that could n't be furthest from the truth . 
  he comes from the ena school , which has long formed a deep state within us ; a state within our state . 
  48 % of ministers ' cabinets of sarkozy were ena people . 
  48 % of ministers ' cabinets of hollande were ena people .

  he is the system . 
  -- these guys are responsible for the state going nowhere in the last 4 decades . 
  they control how decisions are implemented and have their own theories on how and where france has to be led . 
  whoever will become president will probably not root out this core . 
  it is useless to expect change if you are in france .
