  some have said it could take 10 years . 
  with luck , we 'll only have 2 . 
  or 1.5 if we 're following the wishes of the commissioners . 
  but does she have a choice ? 
  i mean , this is the baseline of the negotiation : we go back to not being any treaty between the uk and the eu . 
  what she is doing here is preparing the public to it . 
  transnistria , donbas , abkhazia , crimea , nagorno-karabakh , south ossetia , are certainly not under control of their original owners . 
  russian colonels are . 
  this is what i call lack of control over your own army . 
  colonels carve themselves some territory , and russia does n't punish them . 
  or do you mean russia encouraged them ? 
  whatever you may want to call it , you ca n't deny there is a problem here . 
  --  really ? 
  any example of that ? 
  well [ you guys have good anti-air tech ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/flight-mh17-shot-down-by-missile-brought-in-from-russia-ukraine-malaysia-airlines ) , at least . 
  you 're not exactly allies . 
  you guys have nuclear warheads , decent technology and a un veto ; and that 's pretty much why your incursions in our shared neighborhood ca n't be punished . 
  instabilities close to our borders are a threat to us . 
  it would be great if your colonels could stop carving themselves chunks of territories . 
  do n't they have enough of transnistria , donbas , abkhazia , crimea , nagorno-karabakh , south ossetia ? 
  russia is not a threat to france specifically . 
  russia , or , more precisely : your lack of control over your own army is a threat to everyone in the region . 
  indeed !, 
  we 're not on the level of russia - our main threat - , for example . 
  but we have a start . 
  and some retaliation power . 
  i do n't think building huge nuclear capabilities is going to go well politically , though . 
   is missing a land based missile delivery system france is not resourceless either . 
  we have a space program , and are perfectly able to make payloads go around the world . 
  unrelated to the current issue : [ how the actual negotiation will unfold . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuc2eqvdzmy ), 
  interesting . 
  so there might indeed be a silver lining for the whole of humanity in brexit . 
   13 % you 're wrong . 
  [ go take a look here ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/ ) , and tell me what percentage the purple color makes up . 
  -- about dropping to zero : of course it wo n't . 
  that 's an example to talk a bout the asymmetry of the negotiation . 
  but this asymmetry will be felt on every single issue . 
  on the level of tariffs to impose , for example . 
  i think it would be of great benefit to the masses if the low regulated financial industry of the city is a collateral casualty of brexit . 
  money has to flow . 
  better it be in a regulated environment . 
  we have already seen a lots of articles coming from this money not wanting to move , to be regulated . 
  and i bet we will continue until it dies . 
  barnier never asked for any deal , btw :  a spokesman for the european commission insisted the minutes , which were drawn up by european parliament officials , did not `` correctly reflect what mr barnier said '' . 
  this will only go one way . 
  that 's an exaggerated figure of speech . 
  the actual numbers for the [ share of export the uk has with the ue is 44 % ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/ ) . 
  44 % is a \\ _ big _ hole though . 
  this exact same trade only [ represents only 7.3 % for say , france ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/fra/ ) . 
  in the negotiations , the risks and amounts will be spread across all eu members ; while being crushingly concentrated issues for the uk . 
  on one side it would cost a few years of growth . 
  on the other it would be north-korea-like prospects . 
  sure , nobody wants trade to stop . 
  but strategically speaking , the eu is not forced to grant anything . 
  -- but who am i to comment on this ? 
  i 'll just say that your negotiators are fleeing away left and right . 
  that does n't look good . 
  yeah . 
  anyway there is no negotiation taking place now . 
  all that can be done is speculate . 
  i 'd be interested in your opinion on [ my other comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5nst4o/eu_negotiator_wants_special_deal_over_access_to/dce3vs8/ ) . 
  yes , nobody knows what the future will yield . 
  the eu may become a powerful federal state . 
  the eu may break up . 
  the uk might develop a specialization outside the eu , and prosper . 
  he might also wither away , isolated . 
  -- one thing is certain , though . 
  this brexit negotiation will be extremely one-sided . 
  lets take having the borders open for trade for example . 
  if it does n't happen , each eu country will lose a low percentage of income . 
  if it does n't happen , the uk state and economy will collapse about 70 % . 
  every single issue will be of mild inconvenience on the eu side , while being a matter of life and death for the uk . 
  and this is n't a usual trade deal out of which you can back off if it does n't look good . 
  separation will happen , deal or no deal . 
  for negotiation to happen , you need a price . 
  you need to have alternatives ; and the deal will align to the best alternative to a negotiated agreement ( batna ) there is . 
  there is no fucking batna here . 
  the batna is get rekt , son , and lose 70 % of your trade . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : brexit negotiation : 1 . 
  batna is an abysmal void 2 . 
  every issue will represent : mild inconvenience for the eu , life and death for the uk i do n't see how it can go well for the uk . 
  what does go both ways ? 
   a spokesman for the european commission insisted the minutes , which were drawn up by european parliament officials , did not `` correctly reflect what mr barnier said '' . 
   but the minutes do mirror the view of the governor of the bank of england , mark carney . 
  an alarmingly high number of these brexit articles are wishful thinking . 
  granted , there is very little information : nobody know how brexit will go . 
  but the bias is always on the same side , whatever the paper is . 
  i guess we 'll only truly know how much the uk got fucked a decade after article 50 is triggered . 
   twenty eight french mps voted in favor of the rules , while four opposed them out of 577 . 
  that 's 5.5 % attendance . 
  our parliament is a joke . 
  nope . 
  from : http://www.politico.eu/article/architect-of-australias-controversial-immigration-policy-jim-molan-how-to-do-it-in-europe-terror-extremism/  australia 's three-pillar approach :  1 ) turning back boats on the mediterranean ,  2 ) processing asylum seekers offshore and  3 ) resettling them outside of the continent ( numbering and punctuation mine ), 
  we have n't even tried . 
  australia is managing it pretty perfectly . 
  oh that 's not a perfect solution . 
  but if it reduces numbers by even 40 % , it would be worth it . 
  i think it should be complemented with a vast array of others measures , too . 
  programs with countries beyond the border to reinforce the effectiveness of the border ; a finely-tuned system detecting and tracking illegals when they are inside ; and an active deportation process - in a safe country - if they do manage to get in .
