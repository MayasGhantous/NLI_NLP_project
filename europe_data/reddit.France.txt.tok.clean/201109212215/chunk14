   the people just use another route and then you patch these weak parts too . 
  if they work locally ; applied globally they will work . 
  treaties can be amended . 
  true . 
  they 're blunt , they 're cynics , and they phrase things to trigger a reaction . 
  but they have some sort of energetic pragmatism on the subjects they defend . 
  walls do work , indeed . 
  that 's really shitty to rub it in to the germans ; but walls to work . 
  walls [ did work in hungary ] ( https://i.sli.mg/penmg4.png ) to stop the inflood of migrants . 
  walls will work for their illegal immigration . 
  my title is not that different from theirs . 
  yes they themselves did some editorialization . 
  they did cherrypick from the annual report on human rights and democracy . 
  but , hey , reports are meant to be read and discussed on points that are close to one 's interests . 
  war and people deportation is not pricy ? 
   fell by nearly two-thirds to 364 000 that 's 364 000 too much, 
  i 'm glad you had such an ego boost . 
  i 'm not glad it came at such a pricy cost . 
  same criteria violation : fitting into the culture . 
  another reason why turkey has absolutely no place in the eu . 
   `` i once asked the chancellor , what would be more costly for germany : for france to be allowed to have half a percentage point more deficit , or for marine le pen to become president ? '', 
  he said , referring to the leader of the far-right national front . 
   `` until today , she still owes me an answer , '' added gabriel sometimes , i think merkel actually has a hidden eurosceptic agenda . 
  between this and the refugees . . 
  well , a clusterfuck happened , and it happened while she was in command ; before her `` wir schaffen das '' , as you say . 
  she watched them come in and stayed silent . 
  a few countries closed their schengen borders . 
  why did n't she do so ? 
  she is one of the few and earliest to state the `` multikulti '' concept had utterly failed and that a `` fully covered woman has little chance of integrating in germany . '' . 
  and yet , we have seen absolutely zero real initiatives to address these problems from her . 
  in the position she is in , negligence and failure to act is exactly like acting and fucking up . 
  someone could have prevented it , and that someone is her . 
  she bears immense responsibility for the current situation . 
  i mean , if she does n't , who does then ? 
  is there no one at the helm ? 
   so maybe we need a scheme were the eu helps out greece in sorting out its judiciary . 
  or a general overhaul of the system : http://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/austrian-defence-minister-eyes-plan-to-overhaul-eu-migrant-policy/ [ comments here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mddjm/austrian_defence_minister_eyes_plan_to_overhaul/ ), 
  well , in a freedom of movement area , the security of all is set by the weakest part . 
  we need extreme vetting of immigrants and a federal europe to enforce them . 
  excerpts :  [ ... ] revamp the european union 's migrant policy by establishing a ceiling for migration and only permitting applications for asylum from outside the eu  [ ... ] the eu has limited capacity to absorb more migrants . 
  we must stop illegal immigration  [ ... ] calls for an eu migration ceiling based on limits set by member states , which would effectively force countries like germany that do not currently have such a limit to establish one . 
   the chancellor is preparing for frosty trans-atlantic relations while at the same time trying to pull europe together . 
  merkel trying to pull europe together ? 
  merkel might be popular in germany , but she is an abysmally crappy person for the eu . 
  her policies have been actively destroying europe . 
  her refusal to implement strict immigration control let millions of migrants roam freely in europe . 
  that is one of the biggest population change in history since wwii . 
  she , alone , is responsible for the far right rise across all europe ; which is actually what will bring an end to the eu . 
  she , alone , is responsible for making the uk lean on the side of brexit . 
  what a big pile of crap she is . 
  i hope she dies in hell . 
  and that 's exactly why we do n't want turkey in the eu . 
  what a sad thing to be able to say . 
  -- on the other hand , in france we have a history of choosing a third way . 
  macron and fillon being the darling of the electorate baffles me . 
  both have been in position of power , both have been tried ; do people really like to keep the same old wasteful , corrupt system ? 
  it 'd be great if he could stay there . 
  why not both ? 
  it would be great to have it replace the accession process ; and clearly and permanently mark the eu 's southern and eastern limit . 
  what a two faced trainwreck . 
  i believe a form of nationalism that is both european and national is possible . 
  a federal eu could implement strict borders , have a strong foreign policy ; while carving out vast amounts of freedom for national countries to attend to their specific national quirks . 
  i 'll go as far as saying the eu * needs * a nationalist movement in order to build itself . 
  -- a beefed up * in varietate concordia * , if you will . 
  shame !, 
  shame !, 
  shame !, 
  sort of . 
  i fat fingered it , though . 
  ftfy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6xl9tbwt54, 
  \u2764 + ukraine - turkey, 
  dublin rules are meant for this . 
  imho international law should take a page from them . 
  --  there is little europe can do has europe even tried ? 
  frontex has an abysmally low budget , and adversarial laws in its path . 
  and there are countless other things to do . 
  australia has the same sea borders immigration configuration , are they are doing just fine . 
  and there is also the solution in helping refugees locally , instead of letting them think a 2000km trip is worth it . 
  merkel bears the responsibility for the drowned dead kids . 
  refugees stop being refugees and become economic migrants the second they go past the first safe country . 
  germany has no border with a country at war . 
  therefore , there is zero refugees in germany . 
  feels * + data *, 
  you are pushing for a biaised view . 
  i 'm sure you 're well used to bulldozing people with an endless discussion so we 're not having one . 
  it boils down to what she said vs how she controlled how it was heard . 
  this debate is moot now anyway , enjoy your 1.2 million lawyers and doctors . 
  you do it frequently . 
  [ this one from 13 hours ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jiz3n/muslim_protest_against_liberation_of_syria/ ) was an easy example to find . 
  you say `` agenda pushing/unreliable source '' . 
  first those are two orthogonal , very different things . 
  second , it is very clear you are the one pushing an agenda here . 
  you do n't like what is displayed here and you blindly censor it . 
  you 're doing a crappy job by confusing your ( publicly-well-known ) opinion with your powers as a mod . 
  third , as a mod you have the moral obligation to show restraint and use another account for your political opinions . 
  we have a different definition for backpedaling . 
  to me , going from `` we will do this '' ( words from you sacro-saint post ) to `` repatriation , repatriation and once more , repatriation '' is backpedaling . 
  feel free in continuing to maintain your own reality distortion field . 
  and do continue in your blind , misplaced love of someone who is fucking most of its european partners over , in countless ways . 
  she is the [ main source of euroscepticism ] ( https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahukewja4-i_tobrahubxrokhyzzdzcqfggamaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.express.co.uk%2fnews%2fworld%2f738932%2fangela-merkel-responsible-euroscepticism-eu&amp;usg=afqjcngxrxshoahjrvrd8qzrfdkjujjfqq&amp;sig2=rw-7f-vstebbvhzi8ke4vq&amp;bvm=bv.142059868,d.d2s ) by a hugely far margin .
