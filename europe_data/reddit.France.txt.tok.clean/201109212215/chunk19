  and lastly when was the local population consulted on this arrival ? 
  interactions are between 2 parts . 
  why are we only talking about the coming side ? 
  oh , i 'm lazy too . 
  but sometimes , issues are of great importance . 
  i get where you 're coming from . 
  it has a different meaning in france . 
  your socialists are our communists . 
  our socialist are like : a lil bit more corporate taxes , and a lil more welfare , plus a lil more liberal social thingies . 
  but that 's about it . 
  more like democrats in the us or the labour in uk . 
  it is very tame . 
   funding from bank loans well , it 's macron after all . 
  -- damn , seems like a clean and clear split . 
  m\u00e9lenchon + the socialist candidate + macron cannibalising each other 's electorate feels all three will have it tough . 
  having critical mass is important . 
  has he stated what happens after the election ? 
  regardless of him winning , will he push some d\u00e9put\u00e9s forward in the l\u00e9gislative election , mayors , european mps , etc ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  she 's sort of a socialist , but only for the legal citizens . 
  i have not been following things very closely . 
  what will be the status of macron 's candidacy to the socialist primaries ? 
  how can a party fare well without a good candidate ? 
  can a candidate do well without a party ? 
  have they talked about having him in the primary ? 
  a situation where the socialist electorate would be split could force both sides into the no funding territory , no ? 
  music from the classical era is one dimension , among the millions ( billions ? ), 
  that exist . 
  the argument being that one dimension taken at random has a high chance of separating turkey and the rest of the eu . 
  all dimensions are not equal , though . 
  religion and political tradition would be more important than say the number of potatoes eaten per year . 
   a hypothetical future turkey i 'm glad you 're employing both words . 
  1 ) hypothetical 2 ) future . 
  we disagree on the hypothetical part . 
  on the future part we only differ by length estimation . 
  here is some [ schubert ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxhbagweygq ) , some [ chopin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fba-38mzabs ) , and some [ niko\u011fos a\u011fa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z0bbycctpq ) . 
   you can ask people what they think about enlargement now , my point is that it 's a waste of time because it tells us nothing about attitudes towards enlargement for a hypothetical future turkey which hits all accession criteria and has solved the northern cyprus issue . 
  so basically , it is idiotic to talk about anything that is n't aligned with your agenda ? 
   world war 2 ended 70 years ago and europe is virtually unrecognisable . 
  political differences are easier to erase than cultural ones . 
   in the future in about a few centuries . 
   there 's no point asking people what they think about enlargement because turkey no , censorship is always a bad thing . 
   while turkey is not currently in a state where it would or should be accepted to the eu , there is no reason why it could n't be in future people opinion and behaviors on both side of the bosphorus can change . 
  but as seen in the data i provided , it is a very long process . 
  the usa is still having racial problems 250 years in , but spain has good social harmony 500 years after the reconquista . 
  these things take time . 
   it 's also entirely arbitrary based on things you like and do n't like . 
  yup . 
  what is the problem ? 
   the differences in '' ` culture '' ' are minor at best i beg to differ . 
  and culture is a real thing , no need for quotes . 
  the uk left over '' ` culture '' ' . 
  have you read about what was being said over immigration , over polish people ? 
  have you not heard about their opinions about the calais migrant chokepoint ? 
  -- maybe you have your own view/bubble about what happened . 
  but let me clue you in about all other countries . 
  turkey accessing the eu is a major negative to most europeans . 
  here is some data spanning the 24 years from a wide range of sources . 
  it is solid , and very stable over time : * [ 1992-2005 : are you for or against turkish accession ? 
  against  for in all years , gap varying between 5 and 30 % ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/essay_turkey_barysch_25sept07-1392.pdf ) * [ 2005 : europeans reject turkey , poll shows ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/19/turkey.eu ) * [ 2005 : austrians support further eu enlargement \\ [ ... \\ ] 10 % the accession of turkey ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb63/eb63_exec_at.pdf ) * [ 2005 : eurobarometer : over half of eu citizens against turkey 's accession ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-priorities-2020/news/eurobarometer-over-half-of-eu-citizens-against-turkey-s-accession/ ) * [ 2006 : twenty percent saw a mutual interest to both the eu and turkey for its entry in the european union ] ( http://spol.unica.it/didattica/melis/storia%20e%20istituzioni%20della%20turchia%20contemporanea/a.%20servantie%20-%20european%20public%20opinion%20on%20turkey.pdf ) * [ 2005-2010 : eu public opinion on turkey 's membership \\ ( % \\ ) . 
  for : 28-31 % , against : 55-59 % ] ( http://www.bridgingeurope.net/uploads/8/1/7/1/8171506/working_paper_on_eu_public_opinion_on_turkey_dagdeverenis_august.pdf ) * [ 2008,2010 : a minority - just over a third - of respondents are in favor of the accession of ukraine [ ... ] respondents are less enthusiastic about turkey ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb74/eb74_publ_en.pdf ) * [ 2015 : have said they would welcome iceland , norway or switzerland , but only a quarter to a third favour turkish or albanian membership ] ( http://europesworld.org/2015/11/12/junckers-enlargement-standstill-threatens-the-eus-credibility/#.wfphqhvhbhe ) * [ 2016 : yet there has always been clear evidence of popular scepticism towards admitting turkey ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14782804.2016.1178104 ) -- the only unclear point is whether or not our representatives decide to fuck us over . 
  the accession chapters are technical things . 
  making institutions and laws compatible , checking financial metrics . 
  there is absolutely nothing cultural or geographical in it . 
  vietnam could go through it , yet we would n't ask them to come as it does not make sense . 
  a lot of europeans never wanted it proposed to turkey in the first place . 
  with erdogan or without . 
  brexit showed us the eu can break apart . 
  and a lot of countries are currently going down the same path . 
  cultural compatibility is an important thing . 
  my opinion is not palatable but it is solidly based . 
  please consider the following . 
  i 'd say the same thing if morocco was in an accession process . 
  gibraltar might be slightly wider than the bosphorus , but the principles stay the same . 
  the geography alone make us apart . 
  also , the base roots of your society are eastern ( language ) and southern ( religion ) . 
  and on top of this there is : * shutdown of the press * cyprus occupation and annexion claims * incursions in greek territory * kurd oppression * border claims * syrian rebels funding * armenian genocide denial * newfound russian friendliness , while being in nato * the position of women in society * lack of freedom of speech * the coup attempt * the coup purges * the previous 5 other coups ( yay for democratic tradition . 
  [ you guys even had wikipedia create a category dedicated to it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:military_coups_in_turkey ) ) * pro pedophilic rape laws being proposed to parliament * shady constitutional changes * extortion through threat of migrant flooding * spying in belgium through a religious arm , now at some point it has to bring benefit to us , you know . 
  things do not look good . 
  it should be a happy thing . 
  pro pedophilic rape laws is not a happy thing . 
  i 'm trying to find something positive here , but all i get is some ego boosting for our swedish friends ; which they claim they would get through your cultural reeducation to liberal values . 
  yeah . 
  frankly , i 'd rather have russia in the eu than you guys . 
  they might be brutal fucks , but their culture has intertwined heavily with ours ; and their science is a thing of wonders . 
  we can have customs deals for the economical part . 
  it 's ok , we can be good neighbours . 
  lots of country have great arrangements . 
  the uk leaving over immigration concerns makes it pretty clear it is a systemic eu integrity risk to have you guys in . 
  it 's cultural . 
  i 'm sorry , but i would n't call any of you guys a brother , when i would for say a random belgian , spanish , latvian , swedish or czech folk . 
  it 's been a hugely long time you guys try to make a bid for it . 
  things have not fallen into place naturally ; when it did for so many other members . 
  -- need i say more ? 
  hundred thousands more are staying . 
  and still , turkey is not being denied accession . 
  yep . 
  but curbing donation campaigns seems very little to me . 
  the top management and the org path down to the boat operators should be tried for facilitating smuggling and be sent to prison . 
  extortion tactics .
