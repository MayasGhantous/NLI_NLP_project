  -- turkey has no place in the eu . 
  accession has to be denied , not get frozen . 
  turkey has no place in europe . 
  there is no guts in trying to make a dead corpse come alive . 
  there is only arrogance and shady interests . 
   most countries are for continuing the dialogue i 'd like this list to be public . 
  enough with them doing their thing in secret . 
  they do n't fear about their reelection , and that is a huge problem . 
  -- props to austria for listening to what their citizens say . 
  it is very refreshing to see this . 
  the other 27 countries have to improve . 
  ban religious signs women are to stay in the kitchen/community 2 . 
  let human nature do its job, 
  yeah , there will definitely be some wall lining damage . 
  but nothing that ca n't be replaced . 
  the rest of the reactor will take no damage . 
  these experimental reactors incur these plasma flares pretty regularly . 
  that 's basically part of the exploration of the problem . 
  in other terms : failures are well understood and have virtually no impact . 
   how on earth do you link to urls that contain parentheses ? 
  the add link button does the escaping . 
  i do n't know if it comes from res or reddit directly . 
  --  giving the calculation 10 seconds of fusion reactor energy is overestimating yeah , i think so too . 
  but that is a clear and easy upper bound . 
   possible production of runaways runaway on what material ? 
  runaway without a confining magnetic field ? 
   how much hotter would it end up making the water [ about 0.48 \u00b0 c hotter . 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=20+degrees+c+%2b+\\ ( 500 + mw + * +10 + seconds \\ ) + + % 2f + \\ ( \\ ( specific + heat + of + water \\ ) + * + \\ ( 50m + * +25 m + * +2 m \\ ) + * + \\ ( water + density \\ ) \\ ) ) assumptions : * olympic swimming pool ( 50m * 25m * 2m ) * starting at 20 \u00b0 c * reactor is 500mw * and has to dissipate 10 seconds of energy, 
  150 million degrees is so hot that it can break the atomic bonds ; and turn lithium into tritium . 
  but that will be on the surface of the material . 
  the reactor is 500mw , but only contains a few seconds of fuel at any time . 
  it would only have to dissipate the energy contained in about 1000kg of coal burning . 
  the walls are designed to dissipate huge amounts of heat . 
  to them , a failing fusion reactor looks about the same as a working fusion reactor . 
  -- a daily life example would be : quick-searing a steak . 
  the surface might have changed color ( ~ disintegrated ) , but the interior is still raw ( ~ unaffected ) . 
  tldr : you 're confusing temperature and heat . 
  to give some numbers to the readers here : iter , another fusion reactor of much bigger size ( 840 cubic metres plasma size ) , will be operating at 150 million degrees c . now guess and take a bet on the amount of matter that will be operated on . 
  ... ... ... [ interlude ] ... ... ... one gram . 
  that 's right . 
  this 23 000 tonnes structure , sustaining 6,000 tonnes of magnetic field force will deploy 50 mw of power just to contain a little marble of matter . 
  so what happens if something goes wrong ? 
  this little of matter bit will hit the walls , an heat their surface . 
  just like a regular , business-as-usual plasma flare . 
  it might trigger premature wall lining replacement , but that 's about it . 
  they even have `` terminator pellets '' that can be injected into the plasma to avoid having to replace some of the wall linings . 
  compare this to the 100-200 tonnes of fuel a fission reactor contains . 
  refugees do n't chose . 
  these are economic migrants exploiting a loophole . 
   according to the package , the president will hold the sole head of the executive and will have the authority to appoint vice presidents , ministers and high-level public officials with the abolishment of prime ministerial post turkey had a bad record , and it is now doing worse . 
  erdogan or not , autocracies or anocracies have no place in europe . 
  the lie of accession has to end . 
  i hope german leaders have learnt their lesson . 
  i wish he feared us for his reelection . 
  maybe then he would feel like enacting sensible measures ; instead of this fear-mongering talk of his . 
  maybe not striking a crappy deal with turkey could help . 
  just saying . 
  maybe acting in line with what voters tell him , like stopping immigration . 
  you really want to know why ? 
  because five years is plenty of time to work a behind the scene low regulation legislation with an aspiring politician in need of funds . 
  moving to mainland now means they have to abide by some stricter rules . 
  there 's a reason they 're located in the city in the first place .

  0.85 % is a huge amount . 
  that 's about as much growth that you guys do n't get . 
  yearly . 
  indeed , i mismatched the january 11th 2015 march . 
  i edited the post and added some charlie flavor to it . 
  --  and are you implying that the people who marched were all neo-nazis ? 
  / u/slothvox used the nazi word in a liberal way ; meaning having a hard reaction . 
  the people who marched were not neo-nazis . 
  but i bet a large part of them are keen to go `` full-nazi '' in the voting booth . 
  meaning going for the hard candidate while still not being a neo-nazi . 
  now , if you want to argue that fn is a nazi-like party , that 's another debate . 
  ( i do n't think it is , at all ) --  that 's funny , because i do n't recall being a neo-nazi . 
  neither do i. 
  we went the same streets the same day . 
  i can definitely see how it happened ; i do n't think he is isolated at all . 
  quite the contrary , to my opinion . 
  [ this photo moved people a lot \\ ( nsfw warning , gore , death \\ ) ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/petejohn10/status/666045764158824448/photo/1 ) . 
  a huge number have themselves been in here in the past , and can see themselves having been targeted . 
  they have memories of it . 
  it speaks a lot to them . 
  this is also a concert hall . 
  there 's a pretty pretty sharp contrast between blissful elation , liberating fun ; and your best friend 's skull exploding from a bullet would n't you say ? 
  same thing in the nice attacks . 
  -- you say he does n't represent the country . 
  i say [ arguably lesser events ( in kill count ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlie_hebdo_shooting ) triggered - by a hugely wide margin - the [ highest number of people out on the streets ] ( https://twitter.com/place_beauvau/status/554362483461586944 ) , \\ _ ever _ .

  adding that event to the argument . 
  she wants deportation . 
  yeah . 
  maybe they should begin with stopping the ferry service . 
   i think the media have to be very clear , very transparent , and not fall into -- no offence intended -- the sickness of coprophilia , that is , always wanting to cover scandals , ** covering nasty things , even if they are true ** no , no no no . 
  pedophilic priests cases will continue to get their oversized ( to you , not to me ) media attention . 
  yep . 
  it has dragged on for way too long . 
  doctors and lawyers , i tell you . 
  no visa-free travel . 
  no immigration .
