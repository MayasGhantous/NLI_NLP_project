  but what if they roam freely in europe , only using germany ( or poland , or [ bulgaria ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/investigations/10699637/eu-citizenship-for-sale-to-non-europeans-in-bulgaria-for-as-little-as-150000.html ) ) because that 's how you get in ? 
  to each country his own decisions , but in a freedom of movement area , the final authority should reside at the global level of the area . 
  so basically , killing close to 7000 people is merely `` business as usual , nothing to see , could be a hero '' , according to juncker ? 
  the president of the commission not getting directly elected is a travesty , a mockery of the european people . 
  such a clown would never get elected . 
  i think it is a way to start a debate . 
  and a courageous one at that . 
  nobody wants to be flagged as racist . 
  a lot of very legitimate and core questions regarding identity and the composition of our countries are being swept under the rug . 
  a difficult topic should not be kept taboo because it raises some ( legitimately ) hard questions . 
  in the end , a country is nothing more than land and people . 
  why quiet the debate ? 
  true . 
  but i hope they are still attached to their land . 
   turkey is the most stable place in the middle east . 
  tell that to the kurds, 
  i hope syria is secured fast , and they can be resettled safely in their own country . 
   you do n't even understand it yourself - or at the very least you are unable to explain it . 
  you 're really , really very far up your own ass . 
  you claim to want to understand , and then reject everything without a thought . 
  -- whatever . 
   why would the eu break up because turkey joins ? 
  i do n't see the causal link . 
  because in a lot of people 's eyes it would no longer have any meaning . 
  -- look , i 'm not particularly enjoying talking to you . 
  you 're arguing for the sake of arguing , nitpicking on the tiniest bits , evading the fundamental items with trivia , basing your arguments on assumptions you do not express explicitly , not addressing the core of my points ( here , plus the 15 ones in the link ) , and hand waving over opinions that are different than yours . 
  you 're talking to yourself , really . 
  -- consider the right wing rise all over europe a final answer from me to your comment . 
  you may not understand it , but you will have to live with it . 
  to be fair , this one comes from corsicans . 
  they 're really something . 
  mostly good stuff . 
  i would n't dare to say anything negative about them . 
  we like them . 
  we like them very much . 
   turkey conforms to minimal european standards . 
  yeah , [ technical and business practices ones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) . 
  there is no political or cultural criteria . 
  --  with a government that can be bribed , you 're fucked either way by this reasoning , then nothing is of value and we should all do nothing . 
  and then there is soft bribing , like granting a legitimate negotiation point . 
  and we all saw how that happened with the eu-turkish deal : some light reform traded for visa-free travel . 
  ( which is in itself equivalent to forcing a bypass of the veto ) --  specify these reasons and we can discuss those reasons . 
  [ here is a non-exhaustive list . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5f681v/turkeys_largest_opposition_leader_k%c4%b1l%c4%b1%c3%a7daro%c4%9flu_to/dai9w18/ ) --  yes , and ? 
  and the consequence is the break up of the whole eu . 
  as started by the uk , and continued by the countless referendum promises the rising right is making . 
  --  what does syria have to do with this ? 
  turkey and syria share a lot of common cultural traits . 
  and both of them are not welcome in europe . 
  this is why the eu-turkey deal is so much criticized : so we 're trading syrians for turks , now ? 
  how about nobody crosses borders ? 
  how about eu citizenship is not granted through an accident of history ? 
  how about we grant citizenship only to the very best of foreigners ? 
  with the increasing automation that is continuing to come , this is utterly nuts to bring in further low education , low wage people . 
  --  what do you mean , by `` not integrated '' ? 
  have you been following brexit at all ? 
  the xenophobia the polish experienced post the vote ? 
  we do love having poland in the union . 
  however integration has to go slow . 
  we have to raise standards of living without crashing them in other countries . 
  --  uk is leaving most because of their internal political differences and their habit of using the eu as a scapegoat . 
  just like the left in the us , you 're in denial . 
  you 're not getting at all why trump got elected . 
  you just do n't understand . 
  i do n't think you want to , given the questions you ask . 
  maybe , just maybe , people do n't like it when you openly dump their salaries , their livelihood , their culture , their way of life . 
  maybe they do n't like having to deal with low-education , low-wage coworkers with a foreign culture . 
  maybe they do n't like having to compete with them because of someone else 's greed . 
  --  why do you think that it will result in a migration wave ? 
  so , we 're establishing freedom of movement for people not to use it ? 
  oh , they will come . 
  why is there so much immigration from north africa already ? 
  maybe you live in some sort of a bubble . 
  [ here is an account of what i 'm experiencing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5cw9wh/sarkozy_proposes_carbon_tax_on_us_goods_if_trump/da1ha56/ ) , if you have the energy to go actually read it . 
  the relevant part is starting at the middle . 
  states with decent welfare will face huge amounts of migrations . 
  understand that , despite all the criticism , western europe is a place where a lot of people dream to be part of . 
  --  i 'm not aware of the requirement for eu membership that all citizens of turkish ethnicity would be sold into slavery . 
  this has nothing to do with slavery , and everything to do with one community creating and maintaining a ghetto for itself . 
  [ here is what paris looks like ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zjbs0 ) . 
  these are areas where police must take extensive precautions in order to patrol . 
  these areas emerged by themselves . 
  they were created by people wanting to have a sub-community of their own . 
  nobody forces them to aggregate together . 
  [ a number of kisses - between 1 and 5 - , precisely dependent on location . 
  ] ( http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?frenchkisses ) this map does n't say , but the starting cheek has its importance too . 
  gender , closeliness , social status and relatedness are also intertwined in this . 
   the current situation has no cost for us it has a risk cost for us . 
  one day we 'll wake up having turkey in the eu , because they went through the hoops and they bribed our own governments into not vetoing . 
  this is a sword of damocles hanging over our heads . 
  a hugely large portion of europeans are feeling the weight of this unsavorable prospect . 
  it is eroding the spirit of a european state in a lot of minds . 
  we have enough internal problems as it is . 
  why import syrians or turkish people when our eastern partners are not yet integrated ? 
  uk is leaving because of this crappy management by the eu . 
  the us is still experiencing massive racial problems , and they are 250 years in . 
  why the fuck would we want to reproduce this in europe ? 
  there is funding rebels ; and then there is funding isis , which is what turkey has done . 
  anyway , funding rebels - any rebels - is indeed deeply shameful . 
  i believe an integrated eu army would solve this , by bringing higher standards to foreign policy .
