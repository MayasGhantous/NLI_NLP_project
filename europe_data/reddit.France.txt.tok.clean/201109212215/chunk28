  on the economic situation , a low wage in france is somewhat high in china . 
  salaries are catching up and a middle class is being created , so we can be hopeful for the worker protection . 
  do not mistake that this is a very , very good trade for france . 
  as said before , only the phd or very high value contributors can help us specialize in high margin industries . 
  --  countries that you can never influence or force to adopt the same standards , worker protection laws , environmental protection laws i 'd argue that this is not our responsibility , and we should not be so arrogant as to dictate them their laws . 
  but on the humanist side , you can rest assured that highly paid workers will make their government spend more money on them . 
  for starters , their government will have more budget to do so . 
  also , china is currently teaching a lesson to the us on climate change [ 4 ] . 
  maybe you should start trusting more the chinese on the environmental protection laws . 
  --  ultimately , the market decides how much money any job is worth - and if you attempt to force companies to pay more than the job is worth , you 're only going to lose out in the medium to long term true . 
  and this is exactly how you implement country specialization . 
  some capitalists lose their investment , some will gain a great return . 
  in the meantime workers will have had better paying jobs . 
  i see where you are coming from , but you do n't take into account that we can choose what our future can be made of . 
  sure , if we had both hugely low unemployment and very few prospects at high margin jobs our economy would grow from taking in migrants ( notwithstanding my earlier argument about economy growing = / = helping our poors ) . 
  but this is not the situation . 
  it is quite the contrary . 
  we do not have 0 % unemployment , and we have the best strategic position in the world for high margin jobs . 
  -- ** tldr ; ** no immigration , as it weighs down most fragile elements . 
  concentrate on high margin industries to have more taxes and help our poors reach better jobs . 
  make humans do quality work , not quantity work , because with automation this is what the future will be made of .

   the eu has to approve any trade agreement turkey may enter into with 3rd parties the fact that turkey somewhat has half a foot in the eu is becoming really unfair to the turks . 
  both sides ( eu + turkey ) should act on this lie of a situation , end the accession process , maybe end the customs union participation ; and return turks their economic sovereignty . 
  maybe a watered down customs union - as part of a eu neighborhood project - would let them have independent trade agreements ? 
  good !, 
  turkey is well better anchored with its south ( religion ) , and east ( language ) . 
   we have to offer young people a vision of the future also jobs . 
  primarily jobs . 
  they are coming to the market with little experience , right in competition with some imported , low education , low salary immigration . 
  this is nuts to dump their market when automation is gobbling up everything . 
   their complaints do not have a rational economic basis this is where you 're wrong and you need to come out of your ivory tower . 
  having new migrants in has a dramatically lower returns , and they will continue to shrink . 
  say you transfer an economic element from set a to set b. 
  of course the global economic activity of b will grow . 
  this is just accounting . 
  except that for the initial elements of set b , they are now in competition with the new guy , and are doing worse . 
  but hey , on the tally it looks good because the economic activity got stirred . 
  you 're saying : activity ( b ) < activity ( b + immigrant ) and you are right . 
  what you do n't get is that : mean_activity ( b with b + immigrant ) < mean_activity ( b with b ) < mean_activity ( b + immigrant with b + immigrant ) if you look closely , the initial elements of b have gotten their activity lowered by the arrival . 
  you 're saying this is not a zero sum game . 
  but this is not pure wealth created out of thin air either . 
  there are two components to this . 
  it all comes to comparing the immigrant 's cross contribution to creating other jobs for the b set with the increased competition towards the b set . 
  now , for this contribution , let me clue you in that : * they do n't all get jobs . 
  this means zero positive activity . 
  * they do n't all get jobs , they are on welfare . 
  this means a negative on the activity . 
  * most migrants ' job are lowly paid ones . 
  there will be little consumption created . 
  * a large part of their revenue will go back to their family in their country of origin . 
  not to the local economy . 
  * those who stay temporarily stay will get out with the totality of the money they have garnered . 
  for the competition : * in an economy where unemployment is above 0 % , their having a job is taking someone out of the working pool . 
  * in the case they do get a higher paying job , this is still increased pressure on the salaries of the local population . 
  now , take all these points in , and think hard about each of them and ** all the automation that is coming in ** . 
  the threshold for contributing to society is just going through the roof . 
  for everyone , but even more so from migrants . 
  so , what should the criteria be for having new ones in ? 
  either : * with a salary provably higher than a multiplier ( lower contribution to local economy , risks ) of the average salary ( which is where the balance is for taxes generated to attend to increased competition ) . 
  this means , in france , that they must have a salary greater than 70k euro yearly . 
  this is without them bringing the stay-at-home wife , or welfare for kids . 
  * they have a phd with proven industrial applicability . 
  -- and this is without any analysis of the cultural cost . 
  -- now , feel free to blanket tell me i 'm wrong , not address any of my points ; to continue to rely on your false beliefs , get offended and vote for someone who tells you you 're right . 
  -- i 'll tell you what does work : * fine analysis of how your fellow citizens are getting their life crapped on . 
  * stopping the salary dumping . 
  -- ** tldr ; ** you are propagating a myth ; and in our world of increasingly total automation you are deadly , deadly wrong . 
  my intellectual underwhelment is probably preventing me from understanding what you said . 
  please expand on :  that should actually lead to exclusion on any argument also , there are 3 sentences . 
  we will not mop up germany 's fuck up . 
  they invited them in . 
  they 're keeping them . 
  i disagree . 
  there is not capital punishment as of now . 
  they do not risk their lives . 
  merely they lost their job as academics . 
  the opposition in turkey is getting flak at the moment yes . 
  but here is what should be taken from the article :  `` we can not solve turkey 's problems by inviting all critical citizens to apply for asylum here . 
  that is exactly what he wants : the opposition disappears , '' said mayer . 
  -- also , turkey has no place in the eu . 
  and we do not welcome immigration by political incidents ; all the while this is still being an abuse of the asylum status . 
  erdogan or not , turkey has no place in the eu . 
  turkey has no place in the eu . 
  both now and ever . 
  time will make you wrong . 
  most of them will stay . 
  you 'd be surprised to see my voting history . 
  the eu 's economy is centered on germany , and it fucks up the imports/exports of the smaller ones . 
  now , there is a global benefit by having a common economic zone , and it is thus mostly reaped by germany . 
  it is still germany 's money . 
  but it makes my blood boil to selectively offer aid to foreigners when your partners are in need , and themselves crumbling under the assistance they have to provide to refugees too . 
  france is perfectly able to be alone , thank you . 
  now , i 'll specify what i meant by `` what is the eu without france ? '', 
  the eu will lose half of its core , meaning , and spain and portugal will be disconnected . 
  also , the eu wo n't have any nuclear weapon . 
  do not fuck up the eu so much that we would want an out . 
  it happened with the uk , france is not very far from it . 
  -- i agree with you on the rest . 
  when there is freedom of movement , one state can not invite massive amounts of foreigners .
