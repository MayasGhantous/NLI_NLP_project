  this is a convenient way to censor merkel 's handling of the refugee crisis . 
  any article mentioning it could be construed as refugee-hating . 
  just in time for the elections . 
  i would ' t say nice . 
  damn . 
  and to say that they were to reform and enter the eu . 
  the accession process , albeit moribund/stalled , has still not been officially killed . 
  the important thing here is the author :  denis haveaux is director of the red cross eu office i 'm very glad of this coming to senses , instead of this ferry service . 
  props to denis haveaux !, 
   of europe i beg to differ . 
  and people say turkey is anti-lgbt, 
  * how turkey revealed its true nature and values . 
  you 're not understanding backpropagation . 
  let 's make it simple . 
  -- say a = b. 
  a goes down means b goes down as well . 
  -- say a = b + c . a goes down means b + c goes down as well . 
  it means at least one of b or c must go down . 
  but one can remain constant or even go up . 
  -- a is the immigration being fucked up . 
  b and c are the expression of power of 2 different entities . 
  in the a = b scenario , b ca n't escape responsibility . 
  in the a = b + c scenario , b can escape responsibility to some extent . 
  the important thing here being `` to some extent '' . 
  c ca n't take the hit for so long . 
  b fears to some extent fucking up . 
  a = b + c is representative democracy . 
  in our situation we have b = d + e + f ( juncker negotiates with each government over a single decision ) , and d = g + h + i ( juncker in his initial election had to please each government and the parliament ) , and g = j + k + l ( each government got elected over a range of concerns ) now , by the power of ' + ' being associative , we have : a = b + c + ... + g + h + i + j + k + l + ... + z. 
  and b can do whatever the fuck it wants , as the fuckups can be amply diluted and directed across a vast supply of other participants . 
  in other words : excuses . 
  you 're saying `` buuut theyy 're aaall eleeected '' . 
  yes they are . 
  responsibility dispatch has way to many pathways , though . 
  and accountability - which is the ' = ' constraint operator here - is powerless . 
  simple enough ? 
   you live in a representative democracy , just like i said , you did n't read . 
  what i 'm saying is we are not even in a representative democracy , and you are not addressing that . 
  we would if juncker did not take orders from votes from our governments . 
  instead , the fuckup backpropagation has to go through 4 levels instead of one . 
  how blind can you be ? 
  get off your high level view and count the number of times a vote has to ** serially ** take place before it affects immigration : * my vote in the presidential election , with the other vote over other concerns . 
  * french government shorlists juncker . 
  with negotiation with other governments over other concerns . 
  +1 indirection . 
  * juncker must please the european parliament too , and on other concerns . 
  dilution of concerns . 
  +1 indirection . 
  * negotiation over issues takes place at the commission , drowned in other concerns too . 
  +1 indirection . 
  why not stop at the first one ? 
  you have to understand that elections yield power , and the dual backprogation through this power means that when power fucks up you can trace it back to someone in charge , and how he is elected . 
  if you try to backpropagate the migrant crisis you have the following indirection of responsibility : * it could have been that the commission could not act because some other country did n't feel like it because they wanted to negotiate another point . 
  * it could have been that the parliament was elected on other concerns . 
  * it could have been that the french government just did n't want someone powerful enough at the helm of the commission . 
  also someone who pleases germany and other countries too . 
  * now we get to me , and i cast my vote on the french government . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : for each level in an election there is a mean to escape responsibility . 
  and there is 4 levels between the electorate and juncker . 
  and he does n't even holds any real power . 
  the eu claims of being a democratic system is a complete and utter joke . 
  -- with this being said i am fully prepared to your blind handwaving of this and repeating without modification what you just wrote , / u/jtalin . 
  we 've had this discussion before . 
  juncker is the only one in the position to have stopped it . 
  but he does n't have power and he is elected through 5 levels of indirection . 
  tell me what i can do about that fuckup . 
  i am no greece or italian or german citizen . 
  yet it affects me . 
  calais is filling up again ; illegal camps are growing in my inner city . 
  i am not angry about other citizens not sharing my view . 
  i am angry i ca n't cast any vote over this issue . 
  ... at the moment . 
  voting sentiment can change over time . 
  an independent iraqi kurdistan will stay permanently , on the other hand . 
  what if the new president and barzani are not on good terms ? 
  oh wait , nevermind, 
  yeah . 
  which is why i do n't get turkey 's liking of iraqi kurdistan at all . 
  yes , it breaks up a neighbouring country . 
  hooray !, 
  but do n't you guys think about the effects on your own independentists ? 
  this is really retarded levels of dumb . 
   nobody wants uncontrolled migration and yet it has happened . 
  i 'm with you on the 1 ) . 
  not with you on the 3 ) . 
  -- truly , the benefit is to pressure part of the population into providing cheap labor . 
  low education immigrants will compete with low wage workers , and the wages will go further down . 
  georges j. borjas - a harvard professor - analyzes this phenomenon in his papers , and illustrates it with the effect the cuban mass immigration took on florida . 
  here is an article of his : http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216 main highlight :  ** immigration redistributes wealth from those who compete with immigrants to those who use immigrants -- from the employee to the employer . 
  ** -- the only immigration that is worth having is the one actually capable of creating jobs : * phd in a booming sector * investor * serial , proven entrepreneur * prize winning specialist -- to go back on your 3 ) ; while i do not think the elites are of malicious intent , i do believe there is indeed a huge side effect on culture/way of life/liberties . 
  ghettos get created , terrorism will flourish . 
  i 'd argue the elites just do n't care . 
  about your 2 ) i do believe that politicians guilty of demographics-changing should be acted upon with the full force of high-treason laws . 
  even if it took place 50 years ago . 
  alright ; but would n't an independent iraqi kurdistan bolden the claim of the turkish kurds to fork off as well , to have their own referendum for independence from turkey ? 
  like germany reuniting , like northern ireland joining the south ? 
   nobody in turkey would care if iraqi kurdistan got independant and about turkish kurdistan ? 
   which fucking ferry service are you talking about ? 
  this ferry service : https://i.redd.it/32ttswuj034z.png  via the mediterranean and the balkan route without any eu help . 
  msf is publicly funded by the eu . 
  and they smuggle migrants .
