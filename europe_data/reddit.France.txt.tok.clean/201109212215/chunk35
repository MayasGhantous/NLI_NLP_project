   let greece and italy deal with the refugee crisis on their own . 
  how about they control their borders in the first place ? 
  -- all this is fucked up . 
  the eu is such a joke . 
  your hypocrisy is astounding too . 
  please stop this ghetto-building attitude and assimilate already . 
  on a side - but relevant - note , europeans do n't want turkey to join the eu . 
  highlights relevant to europe :  `` any attempt by europeans to stem the migratory crisis off the coast of libya is doomed to fail if governance and security problems in the south are not resolved , '' he warned . 
  --  some of the women sexually enslaved by terrorists were actually undocumented migrants who had been bought from the smugglers . 
  good job ngos !, 
  the turks too are going to be very fond of that too . 
  not outdated . 
  pretty old yes ; but very stable too . 
  europeans never wanted turks for as long as the question got asked : * [ 1992-2005 : are you for or against turkish accession ?

  they 've been reforming for ages , and yet now they have elected to enter a dictatorship . 
  the country has an eastern basis for his language , and a southern basis for his religion at some point we have to realize they would not be compatible with our values . 
  they do n't want it , we do n't want it . 
  let the process be killed and buried . 
  got the gif from r/gifs , and reposted here because it concerns us on / r/europe . 
  also , because i am a big fat karma whore . 
  the protest is not fresh news ( last summer , i think ) , but i never thought it had been so violently repressed . 
  i am so glad that big pile of crap of a country is not in the eu . 
  i 'm very curious as to why you would say that . 
  that 's not written in stone . 
  the process is stalled , but not killed . 
  hopefully our politicians think hard about why brexit happened and they kill it for good . 
  eurocrats complain people do n't like the eu . 
  maybe they could stop the ferry service ? 
  there is a democratic deficit in the eu . 
  no european could destroy the career of a politician for this fuckup . 
  nobody is responsible for anything . 
  anybody can waltz in and stay . 
  and i am really angry about that . 
  let her be an example to us all . 
  at some point they wo n't even care to pretend , and take them up right off the beach . 
  they need to be prosecuted as smugglers . 
  because that 's what they are . 
  also , they reinforce the pull-in factor . 
  to me , this is indirect murder as a lot of them still die by drowning . 
  all this for some moral feel-good . 
  fuck the smugglers from msf and co. 
  jesus , so many points, 
   do n't really want migrants to integrate and be peaceful some people , including me , would like it much more that the immigration never took place . 
  you ca n't rewrite history , though . 
  all this money should to towards fixing our borders . 
  we need to learn . 
   some funds will be allocated to supporting mosque communities what i take from this is that if you fund to fund your cult place , then telling your members to suicide bomb might be a valid strategy . 
  this kind of immigration i can get behind . 
  the [ 3.7 millions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_europe#modern_migration ) of low-wage , low-education , low-assimilation , ghetto-building turks i ca n't . 
  hillary has nothing to do with this . 
  you need to get out a little more out of your own bubble . 
  the map is wrong though . 
  le pen would not put turkey in a european map . 
  ... which makes the council as a whole indirectly elected . 
  i suggest that in the meantime negotiations be held with lord buckethead , until ms may is ready . 
   eu council that 's the problem . 
  their election is hugely indirect . 
  people are pretty upset about the whole refugee crisis fuckup ; and they ca n't destroy no one in their next election over it . 
  no one . 
  there is a democratic deficit in the eu . 
  we need to start seeing heads roll , and so far none has . 
  there is a democratic deficit in the eu . 
  for a moment i thought a horny bomb from sweden mutilated itself with an old german axe . 
  `` swedish porn-addicted bomb-nazi mutilated himself with an axe '' \\ - \\ -, 
  / r/titlegore i did n't even manage to extract some meaning . 
  why is there a bomb in the middle ? 
  what about my ` right to sex ' ? 
  boobs ftw, 
  that would solve so many problems . 
  the refugee crisis , for example . 
  everybody has successfully evaded responsibility so far . 
  merkel included . 
  with a direct election , heads would have rolled pretty fast . 
   in a way , its a win-win situation for both sides politicians true . 
  a lose-lose for citizens . 
   contact your politician and lobby for kicking out turkey because at this point already done . 
  they do n't listen . 
  they have not for the last 25 years : * [ 1992-2005 : are you for or against turkish accession ?

  katy perry is such a phony fuckface . 
  capitalizing on the manchester deaths while at the same time advocating for identity politics - which foster segregation - . 
  paint holyly . 
   your government and rural population have fucked you hard . 
  says the british  -- this being said , you are 100 % right . 
  turkey is anchored to its south by the religion , and to its east by its language . 
  turkey does not belong to europe . 
  they provide cousin search . 
  making things up would show up pretty fast . 
  they have a reputation to maintain . 
  why would they lie ? 
  but considering they give y-dna and mtdna haplotype , neandertal dna sharing , family trees , and cousin search ; why would they lie about that ? 
  why do you think they would lie ? 
  on a somewhat related thing , i did spit on a tube and sent it to https://www.23andme.com/ they give y-dna and mtdna haplotype , neandertal dna sharing , family trees , and cousin search . 
  it is funny , but not very useful . 
  the health report has been cancelled . 
  which is a shame ; because that was the exact reason i bought their services in the first place . 
  lets take one paper at random : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1181943/  `` the western and eastern roots of the saami -- the story of genetic `` outliers '' told by mitochondrial dna and y chromosomes ''  [ ... ]  through use of both new and previously published data from 445 saami and 17,096 western eurasian and siberian mtdna samples , as well as 127 saami and 2,840 western eurasian and siberian y-chromosome samples .
