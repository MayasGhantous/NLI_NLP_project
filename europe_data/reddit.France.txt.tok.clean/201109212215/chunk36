  -- the good thing is that dna sequencing costs are plummeting , and we 're going to get more studies like this ; and better understand our history . 
  could this enable very high ancestry trees ? 
  i guess now as a society it means no more cheating on your partners , because it 's going to show a lot more . 
  mitochondrial dna tells the same story , too : http://www.eupedia.com/europe/maps_mtdna_haplogroups.shtml, 
  this is quality information . 
  [ have you way over at the wikipedia article . 
  there is about 90 references . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y-dna_haplogroups_in_populations_of_europe#references ), 
  turkish cypriots are reassured . 
  they want the reunification . 
  the problem is the turkish military . 
  as always . 
  turkey is a permanent problem . 
  and how about closing the accession once and for all ? 
  i did mean 1000 years , belonging from the previous millennia . 
  it changed france 's population composition by about 15-20 % . 
  in terms of impact it is second only to the black plague , which occurred around 1350 and removed 41 % of the population . 
  letting mass immigration happen was the mistake of the millennia . 
  `` more triggered by that muslim headgear '' goes here, 
  `` more triggered by the same-sex spouse '' goes here, 
  this fucking concept of open borders . 
  please kill me . 
  how about not fucking up the country ? 
  poland being last of the list . 
  i guess this can be renamed : `` the countries who have had massive amounts of immigration are pretty angry about it '' . 
   `` what is most important is to have our turkish flag flying there , '' he said . 
  the only reason this got funded is this . 
  it 's not even hidden . 
  congrats on the science , but i 'm sure it could have been done with collaboration with existing bases . 
  thank you for this piece of information . 
  now we know more precisely where the problem lies : he 's a british citizen . 
   in february , a rumor spread through social media that germany would take in any refugees who arrived before march 15 and where are the fake news filters for this ? 
  or is it reserved only for non left leaning news ? 
  how about no ? 
  i disagree . 
  it hurts to entertain this idea , to listen to him . 
  nobody in europe for the last 25 years wants turkey in ( and i can source this ) . 
  it 's time to kill the bid forever . 
  also , the accession needs to be closed officially ; never to be reopened , ever . 
  you 'd rather plunge your head in the sand than have you history rewritten ? 
  no wonder erdogan gets to have his referendum . 
  not that there is any choice . 
  [ article 5 ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_110496.htm )  collective defence means that an attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies . 
  including you :p, 
  if there 's a country on the nato booting list , it 's turkey . 
  lybia was indeed a fuck up . 
  we 're talking syria + friends from afghanistan and the whole region here , though . 
  and italy is in the same country as the saudis . 
  along with the israelis . 
  ~ ~ oh god . ~ ~ oh god | yahweh | allah . 
   merkel said [ ... ] that the best way to counter populists was to solve problems how about starting with not creating problems ? 
  this being said , we need more europe . 
  for the borders , for fairness regarding employment . 
  yup . 
  macron said during his victory speech : `` i want to remove reasons for people to vote fn '' . 
  and i fully support marine le pen being extra clear on what this means . 
  i voted fn , but i 'm not unsatisfied that macron is president . 
  now , we 'll see what he does . 
  if only turkey could be booted for good . 
   ngos that are themselves people smugglers ftfy . 
  and they should be tried as such . 
  that 's the risk . 
  i hope this piece of news makes it to afghanistan . 
  that 's exactly why . 
  people do n't get into dangerous boats if they have n't calculated a return over investment of taking the risk . 
  take away the prize and you stop the flow . 
  that 's what the ugly truth is . 
  take your willfully blind , shaming attitude elsewhere . 
  did you read ? 
  this was for turkey . 
  there are other borders . 
   2,000 euros smugglers demanded to take him to turkey there are several borders to cross . 
  some of them more open than others . 
  itt : sweden being butthurt .

  this map is pushing for an agenda through a narrow focus . 
  more comprehensive information can be found here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y-dna_haplogroups_in_populations_of_europe and to go against op 's hidden message : all the following maps show a clear separation between dominants y-dna haplogroups . 
  europe is mainly composed of the r families ; clearly distinct from turkey , which is in the j families : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/location_european_nation_states.svg_%281%29.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:haplogroups_europe.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:percentage_of_major_y-dna_haplogroups_in_europe.png, 
  eu 's democratic deficit is showing here . 
  nobody is able to find a politician to crap on the the refugee crisis fuck up . 
  i ca n't wait for immigration control being at the same level as the freedom of movement level . 
  we need more federalism in that aspect . 
  i 'd support this kind of measure eu-wide . 
  at some point immigration really does have to bring value . 
  they should be tried as smugglers . 
  because that 's what they are . 
  only when europe controls its borders . 
  forced population inflow will not fly . 
  he said in his inaugural speech : `` i want to remove reasons for people to vote le pen . '', 
  also , it 's good for us french that a banker is in power just as brexit will make eu 's financial center move . 
  this point about the treaty might a pressure tool to achieve things in the negotiation . 
  either way , he might be doing some good in the eyes of the french political right . 
  we shall see how this summer goes with regards to migrations ; and how many more ferries from lybia we get . 
  -- macron will start with some internal reforms this summer ( less energies for strikes ) , and then we 'll see how he can push the eu . 
  he did say that he wanted to remove reasons for people to vote fn . 
  and he is pushing for stronger security measures at the eu level . 
  as you said , we need to see it . 
  and faster would be better . 
  one can hope . 
  learning from the mistakes means our european mps should align themselves a little bit to the right .
