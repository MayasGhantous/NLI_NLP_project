  and maybe not let another migrant crisis happen , for instance . 
  are you saying we should come in the direction of your mouth ? 
  and try their leaders as smugglers and organized crime . 
  because that 's what they are doing . 
  ballooning costs calls for a privatisation of that market . 
  several centers in all country south of the sea . 
  not because there are multiple nationalities to deport , but to have robustness in the deportation flow . 
  this is great . 
  the `` throwing away your passport and faking being a minor '' will go away with this . 
  and it can not come soon enough . 
  how can each country have its own immigration policy when there is freedom of movement ? 
  ah , much thanks . 
   germany usually net-exports energy . 
  and i did not know that . 
  i 'm too lazy for googling it , but what color is the coal ( i see none going to zero ) ? 
  also , what is the part about energy imports ? 
  oooooooh ; so the current spain veto is the exact reverse of that accession ? 
  you got to hand it to the negotiation team . 
  they have a sense of history . 
  something to that effect . 
  i hope you are right, 
  in case there is any european representative team member lurking here : my vote will go to the party who pushes for the closure of the bid . 
  regardless of any other position the party may hold . 
  tails we lose turkey 's bid . 
  heads we do not cooperate . 
  on top of the double tailed coin . 
  to be put in perspective with this us map : https://americaninfomaps.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/diverse-ancestry-of-americans-shown-by-remarkable-map/ the european one is obvious . 
  i pray never to be reborn into a black person under a communist regime . 
  something needs to be done about turkey . 
  of beers . 
  of other things too . 
  but let 's not forget the beers . 
  yeah , and with schengen they do n't care that much . 
  these bans need to be eu-wide . 
  just like with massive inflows of migrants . 
  no wonder le pen is gaining ground in france on the back of immigration , eu , and immigration + eu combined together . 
  yeah how about closing the whole thing . 
  forever . 
  no , no , it 's a latin one : e pluribum unum . 
  oh shit wrong one . 
  maybe , `` in varieties of beer we concord '' ? 
  looks good ? 
  do n't remember . 
  i disagree on it being a much larger risk . 
  -- but let 's agree to disagree . 
  apart from this and from gibraltar , what 's your take on a trade deal between the uk and the eu ? 
  on what basis should it be build ? 
  like the customs union ( preventing the uk from doing other deals ) ? 
  ; the eu said the 4 freedom are inseparable , so a full trade deal like the current one ca n't happen ; how far from that full trade deal should it be ? 
  regarding the 60b $ sum the uk agreed to pay , should it be repaid ? 
  should it be part of the negotiation ? 
  banking is an industry where you manage risk . 
  you build diverse portfolios so as to minimize the chance of it going down too much . 
  you build long term positions so as to provide businesses long term stability over their finances , which in turn makes your investment flourish . 
  you provide a huge range of products in order to smooth out the short and medium term bumps . 
  -- now , let 's build a metaphor where uk is a bank itself ; and the european people its customer . 
  who the fuck would want a hesitating partner as someone who should bring stability ? 
  this is not a power grab . 
  this is sensible risk management . 
  hum , well , ... erm . 
  how can i phrase this , mmh . 
  i uhhh , belong to a community of scientists , and as you know , hum , us scientist are always in search of data . 
  more data is always good , as they say . 
  as they say in the machine learning , [ data is unreasonably effective . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvdczhbjyws ) it would be of shameful consequence that the original data sparking this societal event in this british newspaper be lost . 
  given the status in the social graph of the parties at hand , empirical data of this kind is extremely rare . 
  would a kind soul be so inclined as to collect the experimental data , the international scientific community would benefit from a tremendous advance . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ send ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ royal ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nudes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls hermeneutics . 
  epistemology . 
  big data . 
  i wonder if this is some kind of calculated move . 
  some way to say : `` look , we 're the same ; we even plagiarized his words knowingly '' . 
  the vote transfer from fillon 's electorate is key to the fn to get the presidency . 
  the one thing the eu lacks is a clearly identified feedback loop with a clear link and consequences . 
  there are eu elections of the parliament , but you often have never seen or received a direct message from your representative . 
  if juncker had real power , and if you could bring him down to earth when he fucks up ; now that would be something . 
  ah yes , sarkozy . 
  our no-frills lybian cowboy of a president . 
  hopefully this idea will go with him when he goes to prison . 
  and what happens in case of migrants having to wait more than 15 minutes ? 
  interesting . 
  do you have an article with the details ? 
  more like / r/sadcringe . 
  actually , i 'm gon na go reap dat sweet karma . 
  -- edit : [ here we go . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sadcringe/comments/68aouq/italian_woman_returns_mixedrace_baby_to_surrogate/ ) now we wait . 
  * much smaller : 90 people / year . 
  * non anonymous selection process . 
  * observed high skew towards sons and daughter of current ena alumni . 
  * much tighter grip on the government ** s ** : 48 % of the hollande cabinets are ena . 
  48 % of the sarkozy cabinets were ena . 
  hollande and sarkozy are supposed to be from different parties . 
  * no competition . 
  -- i 'd compare it to eton , with deeper cronyism . 
  i propose that we end our unproductive discussion , then . 
  i 'm talking about trump getting elected because he was a politically incorrect voice on topics that usually are taboos . 
  here is some reading : https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-trump-may-be-winning-the-war-on-political-correctness/2016/01/04/098cf832-afda-11e5-b711-1998289ffcea_story.html?utm_term=.32da80fbdf01 i do n't get why you want to hurt . 
  hurting does n't make people vote for your cause . 
  last i checked , france was a democracy where people get to vote . 
  a yeah :d i though you were talking about a green project that you guys had in the making .
