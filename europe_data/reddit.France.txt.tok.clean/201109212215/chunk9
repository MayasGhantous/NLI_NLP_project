  your way of thinking about this is misplaced and dangerous . 
  my comment on viet nam was silly , i was trying to illustrate that their culture and values have nothing to do with european ones . 
  that they 're on another continent , and it shows . 
  i do n't get you . 
  you answer `` fuck off we 're full . '', 
  to a turk wanting to join greece , yet you advocate for turkey to join the eu . 
  or do you mean they could join but not have freedom of movement ? 
  i do n't see the commission drawing that kind of deal . 
  edit : and greece has 2.6 % of its gdp go to defense spending mainly because of turkey . 
  then why would we want them to join us ? 
  a militaristically unified europe without turkey would make this cost go down . 
  same goes for having viet nam join the eu . 
  how ? 
  `` french '', 
  by his own beliefs , he could as well be an odin terrorist . 
  people getting threatened of death vote for the party against the threat makers ; news at 11 . 
  so , handwaving it is ? 
  i 'm still waiting for your analysis . 
  have you had the time to read the paper , gather some documentation ? 
  i believe the word he employed at length was multiculturalism . 
  [ from the wikipedia entry  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_behring_breivik#compendium )  his religious faith is odinism , [ 29 ] [ 31 ] but breivik and others have previously linked his religious beliefs to christianity . 
   the manifesto states its author is `` 100 percent christian '' , [ 41 ] but he is not `` excessively religious '' ; [ 41 ] `` i 'm not going to pretend i 'm a very religious person , as that would be a lie '' ; and considers himself a `` cultural christian '' and a `` modern-day crusader ''  following his apprehension , breivik was characterised by analysts as being a right-wing extremist with anti-muslim views and a deep-seated hatred of islam , [ 238 ] who considered himself a knight dedicated to stemming the tide of muslim immigration into europe . 
  [ 239 ] [ 240 ] -- i do n't believe christian terrorism is the right term . 
  anti-islam terrorism would be better suited . 
  he might have been christian , but the subject at hand was islam . 
  my bibliography got confused , would you believe that . 
  borjas does not talk of remittances , he is mostly focused on the competition aspect of importing cheap labor to root out wages . 
  here is a reference on remittances , citing borjas . 
  http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/50/3/694.refs -- do feel free to handwave that too . 
  all you did was handwaving . 
  i 'm finished with your crap argumentation . 
  the link is to his blog , and you refer to the first post . 
  be less lazy . 
  nothing much on the analysis provided by borjas , heh ? 
  come back when you have sources . 
  depends on the migrants , but usually they keep local consumption to a minimum ; and within their migrating community . 
  it has to be compared to the native population , which local consumption will make money go round the local economy several times . 
  roughly speaking , let 's say 0.90 stays locally in one case vs 0.55 staying locally , to be consumed in the migrant community . 
  [ geometric series ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geometric_series ) convergence tells us that the global contribution will be vastly different in their impact : sum ( 0.90 \\ ^ n ) = 1 / ( 1 - 0.90 ) = 10 sum ( 0.55 \\ ^ n ) = 1 / ( 1 - 0.55 ) = 2.22 -- on top of : * putting pressure down on low qualification salaries * increased welfare spending to support the native population losing their job * increased welfare spending to support the migrant * the aforementioned non local spending sure , the global economic activity will be bolstered ; but only because there is a new economic element introduced . 
  the native population will suffer , even when we account for the elite business owner who got to negotiate down salaries . 
  all this being studied and documented by [ george j. borjas ] ( https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/ ) , professor of economics and social policy at harvard ; [ which will explain it better than me ] ( https://gborjas.org/ ) . 
  -- and i have n't even talked about the cultural cost ( fancy yourself some burkinis ? , some ak47 rampages maybe ? 
  why is the process not killed then ? 
  he 's talking about remittances . 
  you know , the process by which migrants contribute to the local economy . 
  i hope erdogan gets them , so that it is clearly cut that turkey has to be booted from accession talks . 
  erdogan is temporary , the executive powers will stay . 
  60-90 % of europe has not wanted having turkey as a member for the last 25 % , and brussels has not listened at all . 
  yes , the process in is zombie mode ; but this would be the silver bullet . 
  are you missing an '' / s '' ? 
   a big part of the political power in the eu , the council [ ... ] is straight up made of the chief of states this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  * the parliament has no executive power , because the power is in the council 's hands . 
  juncker is just the front figure . 
  how do we punish a bad decision from the council now ? 
  * first of all , all decisions are secret ; we ca n't pinpoint anyone on a fuckup * second , decisions are made by negotiation and might not even represent the true opinion of one state . 
  * third , local governments are been elected on totally different items than what they do in brussels . 
  they handwave eu fuckups as the responsibility of `` those idiots at brussels '' . 
  * fourth , the people delegated to the council and commission are not elected representatives . 
  sure , they follow orders ; but in a true democracy the parliament often must validate the executive cabinet . 
  * fifth , the electorate has to synchronize at the entire eu level at the exact same time , and local elections do not occur at the same time . 
  this is the five levels of indirection i 'm talking about . 
  a federal europe with direct elections for the executive part can not come soon enough . 
  how about the eu starts with respecting the opinion of its people , mmh ? 
  for example , turkey 's accession has been rejected by 60-90 % of europe for the last 25 years ; why has n't the process been killed yet ? 
  this is why the people do n't trust the eu . 
  because they just do as they want . 
  it is a dysfunctional form of democracy . 
  this is because there is no politician to boot out . 
  there is 5 levels of indirection between a politician who fucks up and the electorate punishing him . 
   `` and it suits europe , '' she said . 
  `` there is domestic pressure in each and every country not to embrace turkey . '' yeah , why not fucking acknowledge it already ? 
  end the moribund accession !, 
  in the negotiations , i mean ; which the eu said are subject to spain getting something it likes with regards to gibraltar . 
  spain probably wo n't have any further say if it is satisfied . 
  the batna to brexit is no deal . 
  the eu can take it . 
  the uk not so much . 
  being able to buy food at market price is worth more than some rock on the other side of the continent , to me . 
  cheer up !, 
  1 down , 26 to go . 
  besides the smuggling and tax heaven disappearing will be good for everyone . 
  they could get a slightly-better-than-abysmal trade deal with the eu in exchange . 
  maybe there can be a flag for catalonia . 
  for a dream . 
  united in diversity < 3 . 
  we do n't want a second spot . 
  we want our rightful spot . 
  italy already got a flag . 
  south of europe was really tough work , please do n't steal it . 
  thx < 3 viva italia . 
  it 's ok , eu gives its old flag location . 
  no eu flag , then ? 
  poor / r/bitcoin, 
  looks like a great idea , but there is going to have some serious planning to do : * / r/france is doing the 19h44 retaking * us utopians here * / r/ainbowroad is coming ; and they are a force to reckon with . 
  * / r/murica wants to take over the german flag . 
  and maybe they wo n't stop . 
  -- how do we solve this ? 
  any paint \u2122 expert to craft a savvy plan ? 
  -- edit : only one eu flag can be maintained ; france graciously gave its rightful clay for the eu , the old eu flag shall morph into french flag coming from the south . 
  [ operation : `` background of love '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3soqyly.jpeg ) is the answer !,
