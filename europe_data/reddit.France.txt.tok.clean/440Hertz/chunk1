yellow zones ... yellow zones are hell \\* flashback from merciless boulangerie battle *, 
  `` '' are the correct unicode characters , and less painful to watch !, 
  good try nonetheless , i appreciate the soothing exclamation mark space . 
   refuse to adapt . 
  but he always writes in proper english every single one of his comments ... what more * adaptation * do you need ? 
  eliminating the french version ? 
  what would be the point ? 
  ( assuming he does n't mind the extra 10 seconds it takes to write in french as well ), 
  psa : do n't use the b-word near a slovene, 
   how did that help ? 
  we do n't even know which cities were tested and which not . 
  but i think that 's the whole point , we do know which ones are actually 0 % ( empty circle ) and which ones are simply not tested ( no symbol ) . 
  so there are no symbols in italy , therefore reading the map correctly would n't lead you to conclude italy has 0 % drug consumption . 
  i admit there 's probably a better way to show it , but if my interpretation is correct there 's no information missing ... 
  is n't that why there 's a `` below quantification level '' symbol ? 
  i wonder how many of those 69 belgians are walloons , and how many are flemish victims of accidents caused by walloons . 
  pretty much . 
  the intonations feel similar to me . 
  you could maybe describe it as more `` melodious '' than most french accents ... 
  it 's really hard to describe accents without just listing little quirks actually . 
  i 've always heard about jamaicans calling everyone `` mon '' but i thought simply calling someone `` man '' did n't have the same `` stoner culture '' ( or whatever ) connotation in english . 
  i guess i 'm mistaken . 
  we share two of those !, 
  smoking , happy end . 
  some other random ones that immediately come to my mind : * `` fun '' ( as an adjective ) is our version of `` totally rad '' , a cringeworthy supposedly `` young '' way of saying something is enjoyable and awesome * `` footing '' is another word for `` jogging '' * the internet can be called `` le net '' or `` le web '' * for some reason we use `` talkie-walkie '' instead of `` walkie-talkie '' . 
  * `` just '' , as in `` c'\u00e9tait just !! '', 
  ~ ~  `` that was a close call !! '' . 
  pronounced `` ddddjust '' to make sure it 's different enough from the french `` juste '' . 
  * `` people '' means `` celebrities '' . 
  * `` string '' means `` thong '' * hippies use `` man '' like you 'd call someone `` dude '' . 
  * many more i ca n't think of right now . 
  commenter seszet on the article 's comment section is right , there 's no reason not to take rtts into account ... http://ssz.fr/brdl/temps-de-travail.png http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/img/pdf/2013-047.pdf, 
  well to be honest , it 's not the absolute amount i was surprised at but relative to the french . 
  you 're a lot better at english on average , ( something like 10 to 20 % more fluent speakers i believe ) so we should n't have such a similar number of redditors per capita . 
  but the offer of alternatives to reddit must be higher in germany , you 're right , i did n't think of that . 
  i 'm very surprised at the low amount of germans ... 
  least favorite country ?!, 
  how am i supposed to pick ??!!!, 
  i love everyone !, 
  & nbsp ; oh wait monaco counts as a country . 
  dilemma sorted . 
  weetabix + honey = interesting , try it sometime !, 
  depends in which circles i guess . 
  i 'm pretty sure both extremes of the political spectrum are very overrepresented on the internet , and they 're both quite anti-eu for their own reasons . 
  i do n't have anything beyond anecdotal evidence though . 
  i think they just do n't hang out in / r/europe because of the anti-eu sentiment . 
  or any subreddit where they 'd have a flag as their flair . 
  well learning a second language in school and * coll\u00e8ge / lyc\u00e9e * is mandatory , and ** it 's english almost everywhere ** , and only ** then ** spanish or german or something else as a third language . 
  it 's not that we suck at english , it 's just that we suck at all foreign languages in general . 
  probably due to a widespread lack of will to go abroad and visit the world . 
  holy hell i did n't even know that less than 50 % of the french are bilingual . 
  that 's very depressing . 
  i hope it 's something like 49.99999 % and many others know only spanish or arabic or something . 
  also eoin !, 
  i love all those diphthongs . 
  why does everyone seem to feel like you must hate the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to love english ? 
  it 's such a dumb antagonism . 
  understanding the intricacies of french is incredibly helpful to learn english , and vice-versa . 
  you can bet the best english speakers in france are also the best french speakers . 
  i hate how disdain for french is bundled up with the adoption of english . 
  i do n't think it was a conscious choice , it just got mixed up when the story of this new invention was spread orally . 
  like `` tenez '' becoming tennis and stuff like that . 
  i agree with everything you said but your smug edit and shitty attitude are downvote magnets , come on . 
  now translate that !, 
  come on it 's the rules !!, 
  ha ha ha ha ha how does it feel ? 
  ^ ( edit : i meant hon hon hon hon hon of course ), 
  2 points to uk and 0 to france what ?!!!???!!, 
  what the fuck belgium we 'll annex you, 
  ^ ( it 's to make our boring argument less noticeable , like a footnote . 
  i 'm sorry i started it , i do n't know what i expected . ), 
  ^ ( but your comment is 9 hours old and axlee 's one is 18 hours old . 
  there are plenty of comments in between those two times that do n't mention barcelona . 
  and anyways , why try to fix someone 's top 5 on a thread where everyone can submit their own top 5 ? ), 
  ^ ( why the fuck would you answer that to * this * particular comment out of the dozens that do n't mention barcelona ? ), 
  it 's the first time i hear that ... as far as incredibly pretentious titles go , `` le pays des droits de l'homme '' is used sometimes ( `` the country of human rights '' ) but it 's mostly a political thing , like `` our founding fathers '' in the usa : what we 're * supposed * to be but fail really hard because we oppress and torture muslims all day long . 
  your phrase is a little too `` neutral '' and simple to be actually used in france i think ... 
  read the title of the thread again ... 
  things '' * that foreigners have not idea it 's offensive * '', 
  yeah it 's in spanish . 
  it 's not really * offensive * , but it 's a mistake people genuinely make quite often when they want to show they 're happy about france . 
  `` viva la france '' i guess, 
  operating in written english is not the same as having all the interactions between the students and their teachers in spoken english ... 
  which is what i assume `` courses in english '' to be . 
  nobody is suggesting to avoid all english material , but the other extreme of the only option being a full-english course disadvantages french students unnecessarily . 
  i think you overestimate how fluent french students are in english . 
  if they do n't plan to go abroad , which most do n't , it 's not * that * wrong for them to try to focus on other things than *** spoken interactions *** in the language . 
  there 's a world of difference between written english and spoken english though . 
  i ca n't utter even one coherent sentence in english , yet i read research papers all the time with no problem at all ( only about plant biology , but it can still get a bit technical ) . 
  anyways , you ca n't change the documentation it 's true but why not make easier what you can change , namely the courses and lectures ? 
  well ... 
  using the english terminology within french speech is more efficient if your students are french and only ever speak french outside of english courses . 
  english grammar is n't inherently more appropriate to understand computers ... and the vocabulary is mostly tied to new notions anyways so everyone has to learn it . 
  the thing is , this is n't even an encroachment upon the french language . 
  these courses wo n't make french students somehow forget their native tongue . 
  it will force some of them to improve their english , which will in turn improve their french . 
  that said , it is true that the most important thing in french culture is our language . 
  enlightenment ideals are shared by everyone in the western world at this point , and our popular culture is increasingly either local or directly imported from america , so apart from a few random trends that are n't part of a cohesive whole the only diversity worth protecting is the language . 
  i do n't really see what 's sad about that , languages are wonderful things , they * should * be protected fiercely . 
  we just have a retarded way of doing it .
