  i do n't see your point . 
  napoelon was born in france , and died as a frenchman , there is no room for discussion . 
  he was born in corsica when it was already french . . 
  he was born in 1769 and corsica became french in 1768 . 
  stop spilling nonsense . 
  as a frenchmen i find this absolutely hilarious coming from a brit . 
  hahaha having lived in both , you are completely out of your mind dude . 
  paris is 300 % more interesting on nearly every aspect of life , apart from transportation ( often full trains/subway etc in paris ) and security . 
  no this neverending `` normans were not french '' and `` napoleon was corsican not french '' is getting old, 
  that 's nice to hear . 
  this guy just loves to shit on anything that is french , do n't pay attention, 
  reading your comment is pretty funny considering : 1 ) french army is more active and more deployed than the uk 's one . 
  it is active in multiple countries , part of alliances or in solo . 
  we maintain a strong presence abroad . 
  so it makes me smile a bit when you talk about the brits being better trained and their military better maintained , especially when you read about their budgets cuts and the aweful state of their airforce . 
  the french army has much more actual experience than the uk . 
  2 ) the equipment of the french army is in majority developed and constructed by the french themselves , navy , airforce , nukes , tanks . . everything is designed and developped internally making us pretty much independent from any other country for our equipment . 
  not the case for the uk . 
  the exports are booming , 2015 and 2016 where very good business wise for the french weapons industry . 
  the french and germans are actually pretty happy the uk is leaving imo . 
  it just strengtens their position as the top dogs of the eu and push the uk into `` irrelevance '' and isolationism . 
  `` run by eastern europe '' what ?!, 
  edit :  unless they let the shoe whole thing be run by a force that 's actually competent , i.e. 
  poland . 
  you mean an army that has never fought on her own ? 
  that does not have a navy or a competitive airforce and relies only on tanks ? 
  an army that never led any coalition/war/conflict ? 
  you are completely delusional , france alone has more power than the uk army . 
  tu as l'air \u00e0 cran . 
  considering the traffic , pretty sure the average speed is 20km/h . 
  maybe even less . 
  taiwan numba one !, 
  it seems you 're not funny , pal, 
  this is false . 
  the uk spends less . 
  you said the attackers took everything , why did they not take your watch ? 
  what . 
  you can ask people on the street to use their smartphone to just log into your emails to check your booking . 
  you can ask for free water at pretty much any mcdonalds . . and you go around telling people they are nazis . . cmon . 
  just by curiosity , why did you sleep three days on the street ? 
  surrender monkey for sure . 
  not a surprise i guess !, 
  what would be the correct % in your opinion ? 
  i believe the union will be more focused on economics , financial and laws . 
  as for external diplomacy and military you are totally right , we have the most to lose, 
  the thing is , a bullet wound is `` kind of '' clean . 
  when you get dragged on a few meters after being hit by a truck your flesh is getting ripped of your bones , seems more traumatic to me . 
  i would prefer 100 % being shot in the arm that getting my arm broken in multiple places by a truck . 
  if you get shot in the knee or elbow then it might hurt more , but it is less traumatic that getting hit at full speed by a truck imo, 
  i would probably prefer to be shot dead than mowed by a truck, 
  you can choose between french and german i guess , 
  when you ride a bike or when you are bitter about a lost football match , 
  deal !, 
  i admire your patience and i fully agree with you . 
  either he 's happy because platini was shady/involved in corruption scandals and he happens to be french -  he 's happy that we lost or he believes in the conspiracy that the euro was bought by the french , the refs were with us and it was clear from the start that we would have an easy road to the finals and a glorious victory on home soil . 
  guess this defeat proves him wrong . 
  the conspiracy, 
  i wonder if it counts the `` la defense '' area which is the financial center of france but is not in the city of paris , it 's just outside . 
  i suppose it does though :p, 
  to be honest i do n't see a lot of american bashing in this thread , people are pissed of at dice . 
  amen, 
  nope only lashing out on dice , 
  absolutely scandalous . 
  way to go dice . 
  why are you so defensive ? 
  oh the irony : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-arms-exports-iduskcn0wg1bh '' * germany approves arms exports to saudi arabia and oman : ministry letter * '' also , flair up,

  this article is pure bullshit . 
  '' - * eclipsing both france and britain - with arms exports totalling just below 4.8 billion dollar * '' while france exported 16 billion euro in 2015, 
  you can , but i am not sure it is the `` go to '' item to bring to a picnic . 
  france : saucisson , wine and cheese . 
  the holy trilogy . 
  at least it will be fresh meat for new action movies , mel gibson will be happy, 
  i , for one , welcome our new vassals, 
  do you have some strange fantasy that all north of france bares the scares of the trenches of world war 1 or something ? 
  if north of france is poorer than the rest of the country it is because it 's economy was heavily oriented towards mines , coals and heavy siderurgy which is not so common anymore . . 
  i am just saying the word `` underdeveloped '' is not the right one , it brings this idea of lacking of hospital , education , lack of facilities . . 
  it is not the case , it is lagging behind economically speaking though , in some remote parts . 
  my ideas of africa are pretty good thank you very much , i 've been there enough times to forge myself a pretty strong view . 
  in a way it is ??? 
  dude it is normal cities and villages , you think buildings are collapsing and people live like in the 50 's ? 
  i mean sure some areas are a bit poorer than average but it is completly normal places to live ... lille is third world ? 
  metz is third world ? 
  reims is third world ? 
  cause if you talk about farming villages in the country side , i do n't really see how life there is more destroyed then in any farming village elsewhere . 
  you got ta see the albanian flags in zurich , 
  it 's a strong word lol . 
  it makes it look like northen france is a third world country or something . 
  am stupid , can confirm, 
  love it  yurop hype is real !, 
  yes , i am pleased to see that our brief exchange has permitted you to judge me personally on my decency and responsability .
