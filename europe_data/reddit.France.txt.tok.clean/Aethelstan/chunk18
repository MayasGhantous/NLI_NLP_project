   and if london were to crash in this paradox world , you can be damn sure it 's not going to be looking too healthy in new york either quite , but i 'm saying that our banking system is in worse shape than any other . 
  we 're the worst of a pretty bad bunch . 
   and that makes no sense because the uk finance sector dwarfs anything in europe ... that 's why it 's susceptible to the the real asset price collapse that we 're currently seeing . 
   uk bonds are increasingly being seen as a safe haven for the markets from the euro zone crisis there are several factors for this : 1 . 
  investors think that we 're going to see severe deflation . 
  investors do n't think ( at present ) that the uk will have to bailout its banks again , so they see the sovereign debt as safe . 
  they 're wrong on both counts . 
  firstly , the boe will print more money to keep nominal asset prices up . 
  there 's no way the mpc will allow deflation . 
  it 's not yet politically acceptable to print freely , but it will be shortly . 
  secondly , once the second mass bailout has taken place , uk debt is not exactly going to be seen as a safe haven . 
  most likely cash will move into the dollar and treasury bills as well as traditional safe-havens such as gold , silver , and other precious metals . 
  liquidity will not be the issue next time as it was post-lehman . 
  the issue will be ( is ) insolvency . 
   given that you could only ever be possibly using public debt in a ratio to gdp incorrect , i 'm also talking about bank debt , which is private until they 're bailed out . 
  britain is the most indebted country in the world relative to gdp . 
  when the next banking armageddon happens , and we find out that we can not solve the problem of our stupendous profligacy with the printing press , our currency is going to collapse severely . 
  i suspect that at that time we 'll be clamouring for the eu and the euro , maybe even the use . 
  amendments ? 
  i just do n't see how you can have both an eu and a separate federal state - the conflict of interests would be extreme . 
  what would happen if full fiscal ( federal ? ), 
  integration were to happen ? 
  it would surely have to be formed out of the eu , meaning that the british would have a referendum on whether to join it or not . 
  if not , they 'd have to leave the whole organisation . 
  superb fear-mongering . 
  it 's a horrible solution to a problem that would n't exist if the integration project had n't been dreamt up in the first place . 
  no-one actually wants it ( you may wonder why the popuation of europe generally is n't asked about further integration before it happens , or is ignored or told to vote again if they are ) . 
  it would not work in the long run because we 're far too disparate . 
  terrible idea . 
  instead , they should concentrate on inflating away these oppressive debts ( eurobonds ) and then decentralise and hopefully forget about the whole sordid project . 
  i 'd be really interested to see what pan-european support for a use is like , not that the people would be asked ... 
  why are those two things linked ? 
  germany is the ultimate safe haven and is at the centre of the euro . 
  time is running out for the germans . 
  surely they 'll give-in soon . 
  how did they do the survey ? 
  what 's the sample size ? 
  cheers , i 'd really like to see how the survey was done before drawing any conclusions from it . 
  where 's this from ? 
  what was the sample size ? 
  do you have any substantive attack on the article instead of the man ? 
  just to clarify : i was n't suggesting that their being greek had anything to do with it ; all football fans who do this remind me of apes . 
  i think you need some evidence to back-up that statement . 
  what would be the point for germany if they no longer had a weak currency ? 
  they actually look like apes . 
   how come that other countries like finland , estonia , slovenia are surviving then ? 
  germany certainly benefits the most . 
  have you looked at their unemployment figures recently ? 
  it is absolutley outstanding given the situation in the rest of europe and the world . 
  the euro is too weak for them . 
  3 ) is impossible . 
  if you have fiscal union in the eurozone it would have to be administered from the eu . 
  can you imagine the conflict of interests ? 
  only a madder man can think that more debt will make it any better . 
  greece will have to face up to their debts eventually . 
  the sooner they do , the less painful it will be ( and yes , i do understand that the currenct policies are crippling , but living standards simply * have * to be reduced - there is no more money ) . 
  sweden went into that recession ( i presume you 're talking about the early 90s ) with a debt/gdp ( government ) of 40 % , greece 's is nearly 200 % . 
  sweden had room to borrow more , greece does not . 
  not only that , the swedish recession happened at a time of unprecedented boom in europe , and they were obviously helped by that . 
  to say you 're comparing apples with oranges is a gross understatement . 
  more evidence that greece has run out of room to borrow is that their ** probability of default ** , as measured by cds spreads by [ datavision ] ( http://www.cmavision.com/market-data/ ) , is currently running at ** 96.48 % ** . 
  what this says is that they have absolutely no scope for borrowing . 
  they need to purge their current debt and start again . 
  it 's going to hurt . 
  i fully agree , i just ca n't understand why people see the euro as a higher priority than the happiness and well-being of their countrymen . 
   it is a problem if austerity leads to higher debt to gdp ratio and a lower likelihood of ever being able to pay back . 
  the obvious way , and usual way , to deal with this situation is to default and devalue , not to take on more debt . 
  the only use of taking on more debt is if you 're able and willing to invest it for future growth . 
  that can not happen without large scale reform , it will only delay the day when you are forced into austerity because no-one will lend to you anymore . 
  if there was anything like a capitalist system in place , greece would have been forced into this years ago , with far less pain than we 're seeing now . 
  this is exactly the point . 
  people seem to think that there is actually a solution to this . 
  the damage has already been done and the people are going to pay , whatever policies are in place . 
  worse is when you still have no competitiveness because you have n't reformed , yet you have a higher debt burden . 
  that 's worse . 
  and yes , that means higher unemployment , and also more social unrest , more extreme politics , etc. 
  austerity may well be unpopular , but the alternative is either more debt , making the problem worse down the road , or no-strings-attached handouts from the eu , which is n't going to happen . 
  we used to call austerity `` living within your means '' . 
  this was posted yesterday . 
  mugabe : elected . 
  taylor : elected . 
  hitler : elected . 
  think about that . 
  it was those six hundred years , and the resulting social , economical , and political ( and military ) benefits that turned europeans into the richest per-capita region in the world . 
  pragmatism over democracy . 
  in a way i feel sorry for the pro-euro camp in the european parliament . 
  they signed-up to this project some time ago , amidst wild hyperbole as to why it was going to be the greatest project ever conceived . 
  they probably felt proud to be bringing the continent together in harmony , for a better future . 
  one thing is for certain : they did n't have a clue what they were getting themselves into . 
  however , things started to go wrong and they were unable to admit defeat . 
  after all , this may end their careers . 
  at the very least it is human nature not to admit you 're wrong . 
  the problem now is that it 's so obvious that it becomes harder and harder for them to keep on digging . 
  but keep on digging , they must . 
  poor souls . 
  i agree that he should n't have done that - way too over the top . 
  however , that 's not why they try to mock him . 
  it 's because they know that he 's the one speaking the truth , shining a light on their incompetence . 
  they mock him because they 're scared of him . 
   what nigel fails to mention is that with a fiscal union and banking union , the problems of a singular monetary union would be solved .
