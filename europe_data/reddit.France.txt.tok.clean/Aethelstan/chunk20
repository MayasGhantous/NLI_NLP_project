  it 's too weak for some , too strong for most , and too inflexible for all . 
  national-level control : fiscal , monetary , domestic and international politics . 
  eu-level integration : science , trade , environmental policy . 
  because aep is a respected and influential economics correspondent . 
  and his opinions matter . 
   we import more than we export this is a massive issue for the piigs , and is exacerbated , if not caused , by the currency being too strong . 
  this will not come back into balance without a weak currency . 
   because the hardships and goals are the same for everyone the piigs have a currency that is too strong for them , the core too weak . 
  this is one reason why germany is booming and the piigs are struggling - they 're not competitive . 
  they need a weaker currency . 
  they will also get a massive tourist and shipping boom , their two most important export industries . 
  i 'm sure we 've heard this before . 
  this thing will only be ended by eurobonds and their monetisation by the ecb . 
  nothing else will do . 
  right , gotcha . 
  let natural selection deal with it : cage fight . 
   `` today 's grim unemployment figures provide a sober reminder that the eurozone economy is in desperate need of a more expansionary policy stance , '' said martin van vliet , an economist at ing . 
  read `` we need to print more money '' . 
  oh , and well done to the bbc for only presenting this particular hugely one-sided opinion . 
  balanced and unbiased , my foot . 
  sport , now that 's an interesting point . 
  i ca n't imagine the millions of football fans of europe wanting to give up their national teams for a use team . 
  i wonder if this would hinder any progress to a use , or would it be irrelevant ? 
  so , would europe then consist of : uk , denmark , norway , switzerland , iceland , the balkan countries that do n't currently have the euro , and the use ? 
  the euro is made weaker for germany than the deutschmark would be * because of * the currency union . 
  it 's weak for germany , and strong for the weaker countries within the eurozone because it 's effectively a weighted average of all of them . 
  that 's why germany 's exports are helped , but the peripheral countries can not compete . 
   everyone 's better off with free trade in a well-functioning global market . 
  say that to the unemployed manufacturers of europe who ca n't compete with china/vietnam/etc . 
  germany 's the obvious exception , but they are buoyed by their relatively weak currency . 
   correlation still does not imply causation . 
  that 's right , but the euro acts as a constraint to growth on all but germany because the addition of germany pulls-up the currency , making the other countries less competitive . 
  sometimes there is causation behind a correlation . 
  or ... it could have something to do with the euro . 
  if you take out the minor countries from that graph , the correlation is even more stark . 
  go on , try it . 
  [ there really is a correlation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tv2rf.png ) . 
  euro countries on the left , non-euro on the right , and in alphabetical order . 
  edit : i should have put on the graph that i 've used the maximum growth rate according to the map . 
  edit : the mean maximum growth rates are 1.8 % and 2.4 % for euro and non-euro respectively . 
  the correlation with the [ eurozone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:euro_accession.svg ) is uncanny . 
  [ a comparison of probability of default for sovereigns over the last year ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dskxk ) . 
  still think the euro area is making progress ? 
  keep your chin up ; there 's a long way to go . 
   a greek exit could trigger a break-up of the eurozone , which would in turn lead to a deep recession and a new global financial crisis . 
  a greek exit would also destroy europe 's soft power and irreversibly damage its standing in the world . 
  this is pure scaremongering ( because they provide no evidence ) . 
  why is it that people still think the euro is essential when it 's pretty obvious that it 's the primary reason for the mess that europe finds itself in ? 
  the euro is too strong for the periphery , pulled-up as it is by the north . 
  this makes the southern states uncompetitive , slowing growth and increasing their real debt burden . 
  to get out of debt , the piigs need to produce and export . 
  to do that they need a competitive currency . 
  the euro is not it . 
  some people more than others realise that gold is a crucial part of the world financial system . 
  this is , indeed , an important part of the story . 
  it 'd be interesting to see how they 'd be faring if they had the euro . 
  it is fairly central . 
  so the spanish government assumes more liabilities . 
  and their 10yr jumps by 2.5 % - quelle surprise ? 
   just in the same way that ` we ' did n't win the soccer cups ; ` we ' did nothing ; most of ` we ' sat on the couch with beer and crisps ; how did ` we ' win anything ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn1wn0ymwzu ) [ video ], 
  fraudian slip . 
  yep , fascism is close to socialism in that it is centrist . 
  unfortunately , it wo n't be . 
  please do n't . 
  evans-pritchard is a respected authority on economics , and has been for many years . 
  yet you dismiss the whole article as illegitimate on a single moniker ? 
  edit : i suppose you think that the [ bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/the_launch_of_emu/euro_facts/map/ ) and the [ ft ] ( http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/05/16/1002291/tis-an-ugly-morning-in-euroland/ ) also lack legitimacy . 
  how many more of our taxpayers ' pounds do you think we should contribute ? 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_the_bbc#political_bias ) 's a good overview of criticism of the bbc 's impartiality . 
   bbc would be very close to the-almost entirely objective news organisation . 
  not so . 
  they are very left-wing biased . 
  and their pro-europe stance is well-known . 
  they are , however , experts at creating a veneer of impartiality that many people buy into . 
   without germany we 'd all be truly screwed . 
  only if you accept the necessity of the euro . 
   it 's a newspaper , take everything they have to say with a pinch of salt . 
  ftfy . 
  name me a news organisation that is n't biased . 
  germany has benefited from the euro at the expense of the weaker countries . 
  there 's no way germany would be this prosperous without it . 
  i suspect that they 'll eventually see that point and allow for the creation of eurobonds and inflation . 
  how old are you ? 
  i guess you 're unaware of [ the reference ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/today-the-most-far-right-party-to-be-in-a-european-legislature-since-the-nazis-entered-greek-parliament-2012-5 ) then ... does that make * you * the moron ? 
  we should just lay mines on their borders - that 'd sort it out . 
  his viewpoint on europe is consistent . 
  ukip have held these views since inception . 
  escaping the crippling over-regulation of the eu ( immediate referendum ) , break-up the banks a la glass-steagall , points-based system of immigration , nuclear power . 
  yes , i agree with many of their policies . 
  speak for yourself . 
  shame on ukip for having policies that the people want . 
  maybe , but politics exists . 
  i do n't know why you think that peak oil and the euro crisis are so intertwined . 
  should iceland not be suffering the same as greece if this crisis is solely due to peak oil ? 
  should not all countries without oil be hurting so ? 
  a major reason why greece is in depression is because they ca n't devalue like iceland could , like argentina could , like latvia could . 
  i like the cut of your jib , lefty . 
  you missed out . 
  i think it was before you joined .
