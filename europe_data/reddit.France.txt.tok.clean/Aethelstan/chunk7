  i think that they 're suggesting that you should be able to exit them individually , for instance leaving schengen without leaving the eu . 
  apparently maastricht does n't allow that . 
  a fiscal union surely means that tax and spend is centrally planned , which at the moment is far from true . 
  * if * this petition succeeded , and the leadership of the pp resigned , what would happen ? 
  would a general election be called , or would others within the pp take over ? 
  i think it 's time to be very vigilant , rather than complacent . 
  there have been serious failures at two major banks in the last few weeks ( monte dei paschi di siena in italy , and sns reaal nv in the netherlands ) , and funding is very tight following recent ltro repayments . 
  the stakes are much higher this time than in 2008 , too , as sovereigns have higher debt , leaving them weaker in the face of bank failures . 
  the ecb is the only major central bank not taking part in large scale bond purchases , and they will need to get over a few political hurdles before they can start . 
  i hope that they can do it without needing too many more bank failures or a stock market crash to spur them on . 
  they need to be proactive now , as chasing the tail of a new credit crunch could be very dangerous indeed . 
  the pound is one of the sickest ( in a bad way . . ) currencies in the developed world . 
  the budget deficit is over 10 % , the boe has hardly any gold , and the uk are still major players in the devaluation race to the bottom . 
  the euro 's going to fare much better over the coming years . 
  the eurozone leaders want a * weak * currency . 
  they have been making plenty of noises recently saying that the euro is too strong , suggesting that they 're gearing up for ecb intervention - to join the currency wars . 
  the worst is most definitely not over . 
  oh it can . 
  i think another banking crisis would be pretty bad right now . 
  i ca n't see us voting to leave . 
  the fear rhetoric is strong on the left . 
  `` catastrophic '' , `` chilling '' , `` disastrous '' . 
  there will be no reasonable debate on europe , and fear will win the day . 
  but the worst is over , right ? 
  `` the city '' is the term to refer to the square mile of the financial district in london . 
  so , it seems do the pro-eu leaders of ( at least ) italy and spain .

  for the eu , there 's no villain like the british tabloids . 
  i 'm going to take a wild stab in the dark and guess that they 've hidden debts and deficits to make these criteria . 
  could any italians of the left give some comment on this ? 
  it 'd be nice to hear another side . 
  is it as serious as evans pritchard thinks ? 
  mission accomplished . 
  care to expand on that ? 
  i wondered when this was going to come up . 
  looks like you waited 24 minutes to see if anyone else did before jumping in . 
   but the deficit spending was n't all that bad until the crisis hit . 
  private debt was and is the main issue with the uk . 
  low interest rates determined by government-appointed officials , coupled with unbelievable preference in business conditions to the banks , helped us to a debt level of approximately 600 % of gdp , higher than anyone else in the world . 
  the vast majority of this happened under blair 's labour government . 
  i still do n't quite see what this has to do with this discussion . 
  i 'm not praising the uk , in fact i think our economy is in more trouble ( long term ) than any in europe . 
  i do n't see what that 's got to do with this discussion . 
  of those , only the scottish have a popular majority to secede . 
  if you polled ni and wales you 'd get nowhere near . 
  just because they have a nationalistic party , it does n't mean that they want to secede . 
  it all sounds so rosy that one wonders why the catalonians want to secede !, 
  i do n't see your point - germany are n't asking for a bailout . 
   over the brightest economic period for half a century rubbish . 
  getting into unprecedented levels of debt for the sake of spending is not good economics . 
  if you and i were on the same wage level , and you put half of your earnings into a savings account , and i spent all of mine on a gaming computer and borrowed # 20k to get a bmw , i may * look * richer than you , but really i 'm in a far worse state financially . 
  totally ignoring the fact that catalonia pays in far more money than it gets from the spanish government , which is obviously why they are in this mess . 
  but , hey , the headline guys !, 
  sure , but when you take a country from nation state to federalised conglomerate , you really should ask them at some point along the way . 
  not for everything of course , but for the important junctures , like the present one where the next step is full federalisation . 
  woah , woah , woah guys . 
  what 's with all this swearing ? 
  it has no place on this subreddit , and is frankly fucking offensive . 
  it 's got to the stage now where full federalisation is on the cards . 
  it is essential that this has some democratic legitimacy . 
  i do n't see the relevance . 
  we hold meetings with the government of mexico , but you 'd hardly call it a supranational institution . 
  it 's very likely that a free trade agreement will be reached : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20875755, 
   there 's no intermediate option and there 's no option to keep things like they are . 
  there is an alternative [ option ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/priorities/van-rompuy-tables-key-report-ahe-news-516495 ) , that proposed by van rompuy a few months ago , which was a two-tier europe with the lower tier effectively just in the free trade-free movement programmes . 
  man , you sound arrogant . 
  we 're comparing to the us here . 
  it 's not as if you can just pick up and move to another country where you do n't speak the language and expect to get a job , especially in a technical field . 
   ultimately , labor mobility will help equalize wages between eu countries . 
  kinda how it works in the us and no one blinks . 
  so you think that wages are equalised between us states ? 
  [ per capita income in the us by state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_income ) . 
  also , it 's not as easy as saying `` spread the unemployment around '' - what about language difference ? 
  how about you , can you provide facts proving that we 're better off in ? 
   the whole thing is perfectly democratic so as long as someone is appointed by elected officals , then it 's democratic . 
  what about if those appointed were to appoint someone else ? 
  would that be democratic ? 
  how many levels of abstraction before it becomes undemocratic ? 
  what do you mean `` still matter '' ? 
  does norway `` matter '' , does it make any difference whether or not they have influence in central asia ? 
  bric is n't an organisation , it 's a label given to four emerging economies by jim o'neill . 
  what is this , 1917 russia ? 
  but the uk does n't have 500 million people . 
  then you are correct . 
  most people on this subreddit are students , so it is entirely unremarkable that they are pro-eu . 
  but i * am * a europhile , i want what 's best for europe because i love it . 
  to be a europhile does not necessarily mean that you are pro-eu . 
  i do n't get what you mean . 
  [ eu social action programme ] ( http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/socialactionprogramme.htm ) and the [ european social fund ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_social_fund ) . 
   or do you believe that the uk can take giants like china , india and the usa on it 's own ? 
  why should we * take * them ? 
  this is not about gdp , but gdp per capita ( ppp ) , and you do n't need to be an unwieldy behemoth to obtain that . 
   i 'd expect the bbc to do the same if left wing press started printing such exaggerations and lies good lord , the bbc * is * left-wing press , and even their own internal report showed them to be biased on europe !, 
  mark thompson even said that the bbc had a `` massive bias to the left '' . 
  andrew marr has said that the bbc had liberal preoccupations . 
   will people realize the insignificance of countries and unite ? 
  or will the eu disappear leaving lots of conflicts and wars ? 
  it 's pretty obvious which side of the debate you fall on . 
  we * are * competing ( badly ) with other countries . 
  and we 're failing .
