you 're crazy if you think a gop led house would elect clinton as the president who will chose at least one supreme justice . 
  if they ever decide to publicly betray trump , which would be politicaly very shaky from the start , there 's no way it would n't be for another republican . 
  why is the eu funding this ? 
  thanks for the info . 
  what were the others proposals which ended up dismissed , and why ? 
  i 'm much more interested in the referendum going on this same day . 
  making voting obligatory ? 
  why not . 
  a different sum of money per votes for party funding ? 
  why not . 
  switching from a proportional system for your lower house elections to a majority two round one ? 
  wtf bulgarians , do n't do that . 
  depends . 
  bulgaria is directly bordering turkey , what are the candidate 's views on immigration policies ? 
  he perfomed really well in the debates . 
  that 's not what i know of most countries . 
  a parliament is a term used for the legislative body of a country , being made of either one ( unicameral ) or two ( bicameral ) houses . 
  the former may obviously use both words interchangeably , of course , but rarely in a official way . 
  i thinks it balance out . 
  em has the no organisation problem very worse , but has the possibility to expand to voters a lot , while the fn has the organisation , having won may seats all over france in the last municipal and regional elections , plus a very strong core of voters , yet it simply has ** no ** r\u00e9serve of voters . 
  some left or right voters may go to em if their party is n't in the second round , but almost no one vote for the fn after not voting for it in the first round . 
  normally being when it 's between the usual left and right party , but right now with the best polling candidates being a right wing and a somewhat center without a party ones , we 're very far from what we were used to in the past , \u00e0 mon avis . 
  i gree , but supporting russia on a foreign affair level is a comoletely different thing than wanting to emulate its system in france . 
  i do n't get why you 're saying that . 
  le pen 's program is n't even remotely based on emulating russia . 
  i 've gotseveral fn voters at my works , none expect her to win , even if they would of course like her to . 
  i do n't think so for the assembly , you ca n't have roughly one third of the share of voters and not get many seats in a majoritarian two round system . 
  to fn voters , le pen going to russia to meet putin in private is no different from macron going to germany to meet merkel in private . 
  basically , in france the president is all powerful if he has the majority in the lower house , and is reduced to foreign matter only if he does n't . 
  it 's very unluckely she will win the presidential election , and even more for her party to win the legislative ones . 
  with 30 % of the voters , though , she will likely go to the presidential second round , and lose , and her party is likely to get a big share of the seats . 
  nothing close to a majority , but enough to prevent the left or right to have one as well . 
  that 's just my two cents , though . 
  as a frenchman , from what i can see , a lot of people would vote for any candidate if the program was to keep the social net and cut the immigration . 
  most fn voters would vote for the eu if it meant having its outer borders shut close , imo . 
  most of my coworkers are open about it within the team inner circle , but would never thinks of saying it out loud around others member of the company out of the fear of being discriminated for future positions . 
  i think the real focus by now should be on the legislative elections . 
  with 30 % of voters she could easily win a sizeable chunk of the assembly , enough to prevent either left or right to have a majority , and our system is really unused to coalition . 
  but for some reasons there 's ** no ** polls on these elections . 
  i guess we will have to wait after the presidentiel one . 
   thing that will be changed if macron wins . 
  replace the r of reddit with a c in the address bar and see for yourself . 
  you say that like only the uk use it ? 
  [ bicameralism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicameralism ) is common around the world . 
  we did shut off the eiffel tower 's lights , both for the uk and germany . 
  yeah , this one actually send me into full laughters . 
  a better record than most r/funny posts . 
  what a mess indeed . 
  no , i did n't . 
  both were the same as [ bohemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemia ) , actually . 
  did n't you only add blue for slovakia , and forgot to remove it when splitting ? 
  going outward was a mistake . 
  r/france lost pixel adding time by reordering the color ratio every time , while r/de just added on the side . 
  thanks . 
  if its funded by soros , nothing of value will be lost . 
  can you recommend some , then ? 
  and who better than an austrian to judge of it ? 
  why is every r/europe thread about alsace full with top post saying it should be called the german way ? 
  do n't you know how insulting it is to alsacians whose family suffered under the nazis ? 
  do n't wish too much for disasters ... 
  at such a rate , it would take ten months before they cross , and the election is in two . 
  are these huge ass walls sidestepped by that road on the right ? 
  wo n't that slow you down ? 
  got ta start somewhere . 
  how exactly are french people happy in your example ? 
  that 's insulting as hell . 
  just because he do n't like orban does n't mean he can disrespect him like that . 
  we would be up in arms if trump had done that to merkel . 
  my bad . 
  then according to these rules macron is n't an independent candidate as well , as he created a party . 
  sorry , but if you were to have it , that would be against the wish of the european population , to be honest . 
  i was talking about what 's going on , not what should be . 
  look like it was us , the spaniards and parts of you guys . 
  and populations will be electing more and more imbeciles if they 're the * only * candidates with a tough stance on immigration . 
  til the pope had to fled rome . 
  well , he did ally with german tribes . 
  the first and last are great . 
  those in middle are good . 
  that justification look very weak in many people 's opinions . 
  that 's why the european union is n't liked , which was the question . 
  that 's not the point : why was n't it proposed through a referendum ? 
  we voted no to the european treaty in a referendum , then the eu and our government went behind us and signed one . 
  this clear betrayal of the popular decision was found by a part of the population as disgusting . 
  i do n't know , i looked at the elections results in percentage - and not in seat , as you ca n't compare them when the total in the parliament has been reduced from 109 to 90 - and the difference between [ last year 's election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland_assembly_election,_2016 ) and [ the recent one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland_assembly_election,_2017 ) is n't really striking . 
  an handful of percentage switched . 
  i feel like it can hardly be called a great shift . 
  so far there has been no rigged elections under erdogan , even when his party lose its majority in the election before the last one . 
  last time i checked he was n't polling well in next month 's referendum, 
  those are nice looking subs . 
  did n't they reject it in a referendum last year ? 
  i 'm all for it but progress should n't be made so clearly against democracy . 
  : / edit : -5 votes ? 
  really ? 
  you ca n't have the best of both world , indeed . 
  only if it 's a list one . 
  there 's proportional system with directly elected members on their names . 
  that 's why every candidate 's program says a part of proportionality , having it like in some countries in which something like 20 % of the seats are elected through it . 
  they probably are . 
  it 's not like she 's a recent candidate , after all she 's been on the political scene for more than a decade . 
  more like her supporter simply do n't have others choices of candidates if they strongly believe a crackdown on immigration is needed .
