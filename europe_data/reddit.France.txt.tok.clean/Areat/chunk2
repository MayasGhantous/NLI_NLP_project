  strasbourg is french , better get over it . 
  sound feasible . 
  fillon has been recently crushed by a corruption scandal involving his wife receiving up to a million of euros for no real work . 
  he very likely wo n't recover from it . 
  can you trigger a referendum in lithuania ? 
  i love the old houses with timber framing here and there , plus all the greeneries . 
  strongly reminded me of normandy and dordogne when i visited alsace last year . 
  funny to see such similarities between these french regions . 
  stop buying into english speaking world 's propaganda . 
  when did a french nuclear plant explose exactly ? 
  on the other hand there has been hundreds of nuclear tests . 
  is n't that kind of worrying ? 
  look like desertification . 
  can you expand on how `` in trouble '' will the family be exactly ? 
  i would be weary of the newspaper otherwise . 
  political drawings are great . 
  one sided ones only are a red flag . 
  do you have examples with obama ? 
  was the survey advertized in others european subreddit ? 
  it was n't in r/france . 
  just discovered there was one being conducted . 
  for proof , they will all votes in the incoming presidential election . 
  are n't the newcomers forbidden to vote , though ? 
  if i recall well , you wo n't be able to participate in the referendum if you or your parents were n't in nc when the noum\u00e9a treaty was signed , specifically for this reason . 
  most of these are n't even about europe . 
   we integrate refugees . 
  well , most are n't . 
  it 's not up to us anyways . 
  source ? 
  there 's no mention of the earliest usage of this coat of arms , though . 
  what make you say that ? 
  as a frenchman , i 'm kind of glad it got ruled out . 
  blue * and * white * and * fleur de lys ? 
  you could n't make a better rip off of the emblems of the old kingdom of france if you tried . 
  a shame they did n't went further . 
  do you know why ? 
  dozens of them every years in switzerland . 
  it 's pretty well know , yes . 
  so what ? 
  why the animosity ? 
  that 's quite rhe game changer event , if i 'm reading this well previously the sweden demicrats basically could n't win and enter government except for an unrealistic 50 % +1 vote share , as every other parties from left to right agreed to make coalition together rather than include it . 
  they could be the biggest after election party with 25 % and that would change nothing compared to winning 5 % . 
  but if there 's suddenly parties who would n't shy from an alliance wih them , the agreement will crumble . 
  were n't you searching for the rate concerning newborns ? 
  that 's the one per states in your first link . 
  search for the very recent highly upvoted map of worldwide circumcision in r/mapporn . 
  it was in the comments . 
  probably to be accused of antisemitism . 
  if you 're talking about the rates among newborns , the future generations , it 's even down to 15 % on the west coast . 
  do n't feed the troll ... 
  the new bayrou . 
  can win against anyone , ** if ** reaching the second round . 
  france 's lower house members are n't elected by party list but on `` per person '' basis , so with that one error i do n't know how much trust to put in that data . 
  : / also , writting the countries ' names directly would n't have taken much more place , and it would have made it way more easily readable , imo . 
  i wonder why it could n't be at least partly colored under european influence when so much of european inventions , clothes and customs were imported . 
  sure it was n't colonized , but look at pre world war photographies of the emperor and ruling class , wearing europeans clothes and hats , modeling their government on the westminster system , driving europeans cars , etc. 
  it definitely remained nippon but the influence from europe was staggering . 
  france is blue white red , though . 
  theresa may confirmed part of l'antifrance !, 
  several millions , actually . 
  parts of the population of gabon and cote d'ivoire are native french speakers . 
  france 66 quebec 8 switzerland 2 belgium 4 . 
  you already reach 80 * before * counting africa . 
  80 millions for french native speakers is clearly underestimated as well . 
  also , croat and serbian . 
  yet are n't actually expelled for most of them . 
  * bureaucratie `` bureaucrat\u00e9e '' does n't exist , sounding a bit like * officecratered *, 
  sources on that third world 's thought process ? 
   ceaucescu level shit the french system ? 
  if birth rate of immigrants get lower with second generations yet you keep bringing in new ones , there is effectively a population replacement . 
  `` would you think of the childrens !!, 
  ! , or be a filthy degenerate ? '', 
  then they would n't be able to say `` vote for us and we will pass it if we have a majority '' . 
  and change their flags to a cross . 
  ` pretty sure it 's mandatory . 
   was rejected on a referendum in 2015 by 63 % of the citizens with a 36 % turnout , though . 
  is there a rehost of this video somewhere else than on twitter ? 
  no problem , it 's not your fault . 
  is there a version of the map without all these big country names ? 
  it 's annoyingly covering some place 's data , and some people know damn well the name of the european countries , thanks . 
  and him actually doing it does n't prove that either . 
  or maybe because they did n't agree with the change proposed ? 
  those manly parts seem to hide in pretty well by themselves . 
  if polls follow the 2016 trend so far , it will be a yes win by a good margin . 
  true . 
  in france , we compare ourself to germany or `` nordics countries '' all the time . 
  italy or others countries ? 
  not that i heard of . 
  a month ago that 's what everyone were calling jupp\u00e9 . 
  there may still be some surprises . 
  what is fillon 's stance on immigration ? 
  [ ren\u00e9gocier les accords du touquet . 
  she does n't . 
  what u/avenflar said is bullshit . 
  you do n't need a revolution to get rid of a constitution . 
  a mere referendum is enough .
