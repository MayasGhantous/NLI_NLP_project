it 's his response to fillon accusing him of trying to bring him down, 
  paris ( afp ) francois hollande * `` condemned with the utmost firmness the false allegations of fran\u00e7ois fillon '' * who accused him wednesday evening on france 2 to animate against him a * `` black cabinet '' * , in a statement of the elys\u00e9e . 
  * `` since 2012 , and it is a fact , the executive has never intervened in any judicial proceedings and has always strictly respected the independence of the judiciary , '' * the presidency continued . 
  * `` and on the particularly serious cases concerning mr. fillon , because they affect integrity and exemplarity , the president of the republic was only informed by the press , '' * she added . 
  insured . 
  according to the elysee , * `` mr. fillon 's remarks , which are in addition to the revelations of recent weeks , have no basis and cause an unbearable disturbance in the presidential campaign that calls for dignity , serenity and responsibility . 
  '' * * `` the only scandal does not concern the state , but a person who will have to answer to the justice , '' * insisted the presidency . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon had earlier denounced france 2 a * `` scandal of state '' * , accusing fran\u00e7ois hollande of organizing at the head of a `` black cabinet '' the leaks in the press on its judicial affairs . 
  he is n't the pm anymore, 
  the ps primaries elected him as the presidential candidate , however a lot of deputies in the party do n't actually want him and they instead follow macron . 
  he tried to negociate with melenchon to have a common candidacy but it failed , so they 're both sitting at around 13 % while they could probably be elected had they found a common ground, 
  it 's terrible , fillon is eating up all the media attention because of the penelope affairscandal ( and all the multiple other scandals that keeps popping every week ) . 
  lr is imploding , as is the ps . 
  i really have no idea what will happen and how bad or good it will be , however the election is a mess, 
  also you have to prevent your id in your designated voting bureau , so you ca n't actually vote twice , or at all if you are n't a citizen, 
   france has one of the highest unemployment rates . 
  better for people to have something to do while poor , rather than just leeching off the welfare system . 
  is it really better for the actual people involved there ? 
  no , and we do n't want that in france, 
  well , jupp\u00e9 was actually condamned for the same kind of scandal as fillon in the early 2000s https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/affaire_des_emplois_fictifs_de_la_mairie_de_paris#cite_note-2 , however it would probably not have the same impact as it does n't have the same connotation of nepotism as fillon employed his wife and children and considering the fact that the scandal was a long time ago . 
  i think i fucked the title up , so i 'm gon na add a bit more context . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon is in trouble , a lot of people are leaving his campain and it looks like he will in fact not present himself to be president . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 is the man that came second in the primaries of les republicains , and it 's assumed by a lot of people that he will replace fillon once fillon is out of the race . 
  and according to the polls by odoxa , if jupp\u00e9 was to be the lr candidate instead of fillon , he would be leading with 26.5 % vote intention , followed by 25 % for macron and 24 for le pen . 
  i think it 's chamonix, 
  we later made this kind of ships too , during the 19th century . 
  we were really good at making ships , frigates , 74 , etc ... but we were really bad at using them . 
  the https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/commerce_de_marseille had a crew of 1100 sailors , from 124 up to 136 guns , and sailed `` like a frigate '' according to the english navy . 
  sad thing is , the law is n't inforced in alsace-lorraine , because they were n't part of the republic when the law was passed . 
  that 's what they 're doing here . 
  according to most polls , m\u00e9lenchon , in 5th position , has between 11 and 13 %, 
  but 20 years old vote le pen more than anything, 
  people know what mlp want , they know her ideas , she 's been part of the political scene for a long time . 
  macron on the other hand is saying anything he can to please everyone , and more often than not he contradict himself . 
  he does n't really have a set base of voters , even if he was second in polls , they are n't hardcore macronist like mlp or fillon voters, 
  trying to seduce everyone by saying anything , the more macron talks , the less following he gets, 
   the president of the national front denounces `` ultraviolent extreme left militias against which the governement is showing great complacency '' . 
   marine le pen , a candidate in the presidential election , demanded saturday `` the ban of demonstrations against police violence '' scheduled in the afternoon in paris and several cities in france in connection with the theo case . 
   `` our country is still in a state of emergency '' . 
  `` i call on the relevant authorities to ban these high-risk events , '' the national front 's president said in a statement . 
  `` while our country is still in a state of emergency , while these demonstrations have systematically sank into violence , hatred and degradation in recent days , it is incomprehensible that the government has not taken the necessary measures to forbid these gatherings and guarantee the republican order , `` she denounced . 
   `` we must put out of state of causing troubles these ultraviolent extreme left-wing militias which the authorities are showing great complacency . 
  it would also be an opportunity to avoid insulting slogans towards all of our security forces and france , `` adds le pen . 
   no takeaway to avoid the projectiles . 
  in paris , a gathering at the call of antiracist organizations and trade unions is scheduled saturday at 15:00 place of the republic . 
  fearing overflowing , the prefect of paris police banned the take-away and the possession of alcoholic beverages or packaged in a glass container , which could be used as a projectile against the police . 
  other demonstrations are planned in the region in solidarity with theo and to denounce the `` police violence '' , especially in rennes . 
   an aggression became a political affair . 
  theo , a young man of 22 years , left the hospital thursday , two weeks after his alleged rape during a brutal arrest on february 2 in aulnay-sous-bois , seine-saint-denis . 
  four police officers were indicted , including one for rape , in this highly political affair . 
  he also said exactly this few months ago, 
  the left also voted against, 
  benoit hamon , ps candidate , wants to tax robots, 
  he does n't have set base of voters like mlp , melenchon or fillon, 
  i guess he had to somehow compensate what he said a few month ago http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/en-direct/a-chaud/30410-presidentielle2017-macron-quand-emmanuel-macron-evoque-el.html, 
  conservative christians vote lr , not fn,

  well , the police in france apparently is n't submitted to the law in the same way us mere mortals are , so i 'd say rioting is an appropriate response, 
  i hate politics on / r/europe , these guys do n't know what they are talking about . 
  they 're biased . 
  sad !, 
  maybe he meant : `` which is perfect for / r/europe '', 
  macron is hollande v. 2 , why do you want him to win ? 
   france  second, 
  yeah and he was almost president before the rape scandal, 
  probably not , i do n't think anyone cares about people having an affair in france , sure it sucks for the people involved , but it 's not gon na ruin him politically speaking . 
  you 're going to have to update all those copypastas of yours , it 's closer to 80 years ago, 
  and he even forgot to tell he was minister of \u00e9ducation, 
  he did n't talk about that . 
  he talked about slavery ( 4th of feb is the anniversarry of the 1st abolition of slavery during the revolution of 1789 ) , then about education , the problems in the formation of our teacher , about the sea , about space , about culture and art and copyright , and then about internet and the `` uberisation '' of society . 
  but it wasnt a private meet up . 
  it was at the salon de l'entrepreneur,

  pretty much all french politicians call for the end of the sanctions i should say pretty much all candidates, 
  also it was an online poll for the figaro , which is a very biaised right wing news paper . 
  turnout in france for the presidential is  80 % everytime, 
  there was a poll this week , on the opinion of people about him , and he lost like 20 % i think, 
  considering what 's happening to fillon right now , i would n't count on that . 
  you do n't have to pay for bread and if you ask for tap water it 's free and they 're required to give you some, 
  by the time of the unification of the german empire , there were n't actually that much micronations . 
  there was like 30 different states even counting prussia and bavaria . 
  i think napol\u00e9on cleant things up by creating the rhine confederation, 
  what 's the problem ? 
  i do n't think it 's more common , it 's just that people care less, 
  [ in more details ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/14/extramarital-affairs-topline/ ) :  do you personally believe that married people having an affair is morally acceptable , morally unacceptable , or is it not a morale issue ? 
  what french people answered  morally acceptable : 12 %  morally unacceptable : 47 %  nor a moral issue : 40 %  depends on the situation ( volunteered ) : 0 %  dk/refused : 0 %,

  she 's a national hero in france , she was very famous and liked by everyone, 
  you know , nice terror attack and stuff . 
  i tell you that not because i think it 's a ( bad ) joke but because considering there are so much attacks you could have genuinly forgotten , it took me 20 seconds before i remembered ... 
  justice is n't democratic and should ` nt be .
