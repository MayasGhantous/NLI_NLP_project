  we are a transcontinental country so deal with it . 
  germany , because that 's our fate anyway , in 5 , 10 , 20 years maybe but one day or another we will unite with them , we have reached such a high level of cooperation and mutual understanding that i see no problems at all with the idea of being a fellow countryman to our german friends . 
  so they deserved it ? 
  wierd , i always thought reuter was german , it sounds german !, 
  hahahahahahahahahaha !!!!!!, 
  oh mate do n't do that so early in the morning please , 
  i completely agree with you !, 
  honestly if you look at the history of spain in the 30s it 's pretty horrifying , it looks like a trainwreck in slow motion , you know what is going to happen , how the story ends but you ca n't believe it 's how it started . 
  honestly both `` sides '' of the civil war started as moderates and if events took a different turn it would just have been two political parties arguing in a national assembly instead of a war . 
  i do n't want my post to be missunderstood : i 'm not arguing that franco was an angel or something stupid like that , it 's just that he was n't a mustache-twirling villain screaming `` muhahaha '' on a throne of skulls either and the republicans were n't freedom peace-loving heroes nor were they bolshevik barbarians ... 
  the spanish civil war is really `` the roed to hell is paved with good intentions '' personified in my opinion . 
  although franco was n't better ( far from it ) it 's important to remember that the republicans were n't the `` good guys '' in the civil war either , the priests and nuns killed by them were hardly deserving of their fate . 
  was franco justified to `` bring back order '' ? 
  i do n't think so , but this was n't a black and white conflict . 
  red terror : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror_%28spain%29 white terror : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_terror_%28spain%29, 
  ever heard of the uk rebate ? 
  you are like a guest in a banquet that refuses to try the food before complaining , criticizes the chef and leaves with the tips in your pocket ... 
  well it benefits everybody except anyone outside the uk and its dependencies . 
  why should other eu countries pay more than the uk ? 
  we accepted to give a hand because the uk had the shittiest economy in the eu but that time is over , it 's time to pay like anyone else . 
  shit imagine as a private person if your credit rating allowed you to get a change like that in just a few months !, 
  nah it 's completely taboo in france and illegal for the government to ask about one 's religion or ethnic group . 
  moreover it 's illegal for even private companies to do a survey about the french people 's `` race '' . 
  they say the republic is `` color-blind '', 
  why are americans so obsessed with skin colors and fucking censuses asking people about their skin color ? 
  why would they ? 
  if you bathe in water you can not hunt as easely because prey can smell you from much farther , there is no advantage to clean yourself . 
  interesting !, 
  although we should note that both the skin and hair of a real neolithic man would be much more dirty than that :p, 
  who the fuck puts france in green , portugal in blue , england in yellow , spain in red germany in brown , belgium in fucking ** prussian ** blue and italy in purple ??!, 
  your colors gave me cancer, 
  considering stauffenberg was a colonel he wore the wrong uniform ... 
  it 's that visigothic blood resurfacing, 
  there is no way that this was n't planned all along by the le pen father and daughter : it takes the attention away from the russian financing of the party while still keeping the fn in the media , it also completely separates marine 's new fn from her father 's . 
  the truth is that every single report from inside the party tells us that nothing has changed : the racism , homophobia and neo-fascism is still there but hidden from the public eye . 
  all the informations we have prooves that nobody in germany or russia wanted a war , specificaly not the kaizer or the tsar , you do n't go on a cruise in the baltic when you are preparing to trigger the biggest war in human history . 
  the only country that completely refused to accept any kind of negociations was austria-hungary , led by a sick old man and jingoistic generals and the only man who had enough influence to stop the war ** and ** who wanted to avoid a war with russia at all cost was named franz-ferdinand . 
  the [ nicky and willy telegrams ] ( http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/the_willy-nicky_telegrams ) show us that both the kaizer and the tsar expected the assassination to trigger yet another congress on the fate of the balkans and nothing more . 
  it 's the militaristic generals in austria-hungary , germany , russia and france who escalated the conflict by telling their government to not back down because the other side would give up . 
  it was the biggest dick measuring contest and it degenerated into a war that no one wanted and no one expected . 
  i recommend everyone to watch the great war channel on youtube which does a great job at explaining what happened . 
  ( although they paint the western front as having been won by britain alone , which is very annoying , for example they never mention the french for the battle of ypres while 1,000,000 frenchmen fought in the battle compared to 150,000 british ), 
  yes but that would create a whole bunch of small enclaves/exclave , the best thing to do would be to create a sort of ... federation , with equal rights and all for all nationalities ... 
  i do n't have an idea for the name ... maybe federation of the south slavs ? 
  maybe it 's because we pay much more taxes than the other countries ? 
  so we do n't have as much money to spend around on charities and yes our government does it with ** our ** money why should we be ashamed of it ? 
  last time i checked the eu was the biggest donor for foreign aid . 
  [ yup i was right ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/development-policy/eu-stills-world-biggest-aid-dono-news-529932 ), 
  did n't east timor try to stay in portugal but you guys got rid of them ? 
  i might be wrong but if i remember right you are judged on your actions not your intent and killing someone unwillingly is still a crime . 
  that 's why islamist kill their american prisonners , because the us government never negociates with terrorists . 
  you ca n't make him `` responsible '' for losing a battle if you also claim that he was so mad he nearly killed his own brother , it 's one or the other , either he was mad and as such not responsible or he was responsible and as such not mad . 
  yes who gives a shit about the first economical power of the eu who has the full unconditional support of the second economical power of the eu ? 
  grow up , life is not fair !, 
  big deal !, 
  it 's not time to cough up and germany will never cough up , when will shitty backwards countries realise that they do n't matter ? 
  you forget the lancaster agreement with france whose aim is to create a unified army . 
  monaco is a french client-state ( seriously , if the prince has no heir the inheritor is the french republic ) as for the vatican it 's the least country-like country that is still a country ... 
  considering the angevins were french ... 
  except making memel fucking ugly in eu4 :p, 
  there was a minister that was found in the presidential palace dead from two gunshots to the head . 
  ruled a suicide ... 
  actually if it was a setup it would have been from the left : dsk was sure to win the primary elections sarkozy would just have had to wait for the presidential elections to begin to unleash all he knew about dsk and win easely ... 
  they did 3 months ago ... 
  well i do n't have a link sorry but i know that because at my poste the receipt is both in francs and in euros and when i asked why they told me that it 's because they still accept francs for old people ... 
  i gave you a 9 !, 
  the ukip ate half a point :( the other half point is for burning jeanne d'arc i hate you so much goddamit !!!, 
  battle of patay best day in my life !, 
  actually the franc is still a valid currency , you can buy stuff at la poste with francs :p, 
  i 'm not so sure about the `` white '' comment , a few years ago ? 
  yes , but now more and more fn supporters are blacks/arabs , the fn successfully stole the manual labor 's vote from the ps . 
  [ depends of the girl ] ( https://40.media.tumblr.com/6192d795957db4d84d1504023ea29020/tumblr_n1zsey1ndh1rahlq2o2_500.jpg ), 
  he never said anything about religion . 
  just because you are muslim does not mean that you have to dress like a fucking ghost . 
  case in point : [ queen rania of jordan ] ( http://www.theplace2.ru/archive/queen_rania/img/2032_44592_big.jpg ), 
  the world survived the cold war do n't tell me this idiot is going to trigger a nuclear war because he wanted a nice house on the black sea ... 
  yeah yeah you can use the `` free '' city of danzig all you want but the `` free '' city was a satellite of poland and under its direct control . 
  poles always like to cry about how oppressed they were on this sub but they refuse to acknowledge when they did the exact same things . 
  except for the fact that prussia was 99 % german ( i 'm talking about the baltic prussia not the kingdom of prussia ) and danzig was 95 % german ... see how your nice logic falls appart ? 
  if we follow your reasoning danzig should have been german since 95 % of the population was german ... 
  the difference is that there is a swiss nation , while it 's doubtful that belgians even exists . 
   http://europa.eu/epic/countries/france/index_en.htm, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_order_%28nazism%29#implementation_in_europe do a ctrl + f and type `` 80 % '', 
  if you had read the article with attention you would have learned that we are closing on 2.1 nowadays which is enough . 
  our natality is nothing like germany 's i do n't understand why you do n't want to admit this ... 
  nope we do n't : http://europa.eu/epic/countries/france/index_en.htm, 
  what a surprise ... 
  but hey crimea voted at 99 % to join russia right ? 
  so the tatars are responsible !, 
  right ? 
  they should do like us , we do n't have this problem . 
  that 's impossible . 
  do n't get me wrong , assimilation works like you said . 
  but `` belgians '' do n't exist , the country is completely artificial and everyone knows it , different culture , language , history , politics , economy , social context , etc , etc , etc. 
  when they hit 18 those kids will be walloon or flemish but they wo n't be belgians because there is no belgian in this world . 
  france was the `` granary of europe '' and is still in the top 10 of food producers . 
  moreover himmler had said that after the victory 80 % of french and british would be exterminated while the others would be assimilated . 
  i really liked my time in new caledonia !, 
  the only annoying thing was the lack of nutella !, 
  i think that if the right wants to win then it has to be jupp\u00e9 , as for the ultimate political opportunist \u2122 that award goes to either fabius or cop\u00e9 imho,
