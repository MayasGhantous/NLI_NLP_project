  why would the usa help transform yugoslavia , a friendly neutral state into a powder keg that was the balkan ? 
  what is there to gain ? 
  no , i do n't want to pay taxes to a country where they ask your credit card before treating your cancer . 
  sarkozy wo n't stay the chief of the ump-udi , if they want the udi to stay ( and they definitly want to since the party has been getting more and more popular with people being fed up about the ump becoming more and more conservative ) then jupp\u00e9 will take the lead in the party 's primary elections . 
  multiple times yes, 
  yeah yeah tell us about the genocidal dictator who gave free healthcare and education to everyone in his country , even for girls , the guy who tried to secularize his country and take it out of the dark ages ... 
  things are much better now uh ? 
  france has a better fleet than the uk nowadays . 
  fuck no !, 
  if taco bell is next to come then i gladly accept a few nutcases talking about jesus living with dinosaurs . 
  maybe because catholicism is against creationism ? 
  source ? 
  because i have never heard of a single creationist in france , evolution is taught in primary school all the way to highschool and even private schools have to follow the government 's curriculum . 
  ooooh nice catch !, 
  that 's like ... so irrelevant , i think you missunderstood what politics meant in this context ( socio-economic policies , foreign policy , etc. . . ) having a federal country with monarchies and republics has already been done ( the german empire , for example had both republics and principalities/kingdoms/etc ), 
  it was legal before a france-algeria game where the algerians burned french flags , whistled during the marseillaises and all that ... 
  brought to you by america \u2122 and it 's pretty stupid since moses just carried the tablets , he did n't make them , it 's like making a monument to a secretary ... 
  just an example of a cultural unification program : erasmus . 
  as for economic differences i 'm prety sure alabama is poorer than bulgaria if you do n't include federal help . 
  and my region ( centre ) still has the most ridiculously bad name of all ... 
  there is also a memorial to napol\u00e9on in [ the united states house of representatives as one of the 23 great lawgivers of history ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/bas-reliefs_in_the_chamber_of_the_united_states_house_of_representatives ), 
  do n't they also differ very much between new-york and utah ? 
  or between vladivostock and moscow ? 
  depends of your country , it 's illegal in france to burn the tricolore : `` during a public demonstration , any public outrage to the french national anthem or the national flag is punished by a fine of 7,500 $ , if multiple people participate it is punished by 6 months in jail and a fine of 7,500 $ '', 
  erm ... no they are n't i bought some 2 weeks ago ... 
  since when is kurdistan a country with an internationaly recognized nationality ? 
  for a second i thought they were forbidding t\u00eates de n\u00e8gres ( niggers heads ), 
  what a surprise , it 's a uk newspaper ... 
  there is no such law in france , prostitution is legal over here ... brothels are forbidden but it 's another matter entirely . 
  you 're most probably right on his reasons but ad hominem asides he is completely right , interns should be paid , not a full salary of course but all works deserve a salary . 
  yes the rich and only the very rich parisian bourgeoisie , during the xixth century it became a big taboo for the nobility . 
  the normal people ( 95 % ) were extremely catholic and it would not have been a `` forgivable sin '', 
  oooops forgot a * t * somewhere, 
  yes * of course * because every men had a harem of women to fertilize after ww1 ... 
  taking a mistress was acceptable in a very small portion of the population i do n't understand how hard it is to understand . 
  i * love * how poles cry about `` barbarism '' while they did one of the most effective ethnic cleansing of all times ... 
  always such a treat, 
  it was the polish-lithuanian commonwealth but those areas were populated by germans, 
  * until the xixth century *, 
  the confederation of the rhine contributed 70,000 hardly the `` major '' part of the 600,000 grande arm\u00e9e, 
  i said * before the xixth century * remind me again in what century is 1871 ? 
  you forgot the part were france sent millions of its men to the slaughter during the revolutionary and napoleonic wars , although germany was affected by it , it 's nothing compared to the price the french population paid . 
  that 's why i did n't only talk about wwi in my original post , a war could n't have done that but a century of intense warfare can . 
  no the hre states combined were still far from france 's population and that includes the highly populated north italian states that were part of it . 
  negligible ? 
  you realize that nearly all young men were dead or mutilated right ? 
  after wwi i think the rate was 1 unmarried man for 4 unmarried women , in a monogamous society this is problematic . 
  it 's not called `` the lost generation '' for nothing . 
  [ here is your `` negligible '' impact ] ( http://hgec.emaugard.free.fr/exointeract1418/pyr1936.jpg ) guess who should have been 15-20 year old by 1936 if papa did n't get pulverized by a mortar fire in the trenches ? 
  that 's what immigration is for, 
  a friendly reminder : until the xixth century france had 1/4rth of europe 's population , it took the napoleonic wars , 1870 ( which was one of the bloodiest war of all time for such a short period of fighting ) and two world wars to reduce france to second rank but now that peace has settled for a long time france is catching up again . 
  the reasons are multiple , one could argue that the vast plains , farmlands , temperate to mediterrannean climates allow for an easier population growth through cheap healthy food , attractive climate for all tastes and cheaper housing . 
  the natalistic policy of the french government is also one of the best in the world with multiple advantages to having numerous kids , the fact that education and health care cost next to nothing is also a big factor . 
  that 's not how it works in today 's economy , we are n't in the 40s where you could reach autarky by simply `` making it ourselves '' some types of companies just do n't exist in your country anymore , some other are n't worth the hassle even with tolls , people are much more brand attached than before , etc. . 
  it 's funny because before wwi russia was far from being a backwater like most people think : it was the 4rth economic power and was supposed to skyrocket and be the first economic power in 10 more years . 
  then revolution !, 
  alright , but keep in mind that i 'm not the best english speaker nor an historian , i just like to read books on the xixth-xxth centuries . 
  autocratism comes directly from french absolutism , but pushed to its extreme , while the french absolute monarch is the lieutenant of god on earth the autocrat ** is ** god on earth . 
  but the legitimacy of the tsar still comes from god and the church , his power base and the political mechanics of the state rely heavely on the cooperation of the nobility and therefore the army . 
  moreover the tsar rules on a variety of people and nations and is divinely inspired to lead them . 
  they owe him total and absolute obedience no matter what ( another big difference with french absolutism , in france the people had a duty to rebel against an unfair king ) . 
  so we have a monarchy , that takes its legitimacy from god , has the support of the nobility , rules over a multiethnic empire and where the autocrat can never be questionned ( i hope i made this simple ) . 
  now in fascism everything is different , the origin of fascism are multiple but it mainly comes from communism . 
  as for legitimacy , the leader takes his legitimacy by being the leader , it 's as simple as that , if he is n't worthy of being the leader of the people then the people will take him down . 
  the power base of fascism is not the high class ( most of them saw fascism as a lesser evil than communism and tried to manipulate it ) nor the low class like communism but the disenfranchised middle class of the 20s . 
  it 's pretty complicated to explain but here is how the logic went : the bourgeoisie and nobility are corrupt , the low class needs leaders therefore the middle class shall rise and guide the low class against both the high class and those who want to manipulate the nation as a whole . 
  the fascist state shall apply its power through a party/state that has nothing to do with the autocrat 's feudalism , the party leaders are mostly intellectuals of the low middle class having been disapointed by communism and wanting to refocus the scope of the socialist state to benefit only the nation , not humanity as a whole . 
  the concept of struggle and of missunderstood darwinism is fundamental to understand why fascists did not want to help every nations , in the `` survival of the fittest '' why would you give an advantage to your enemy ? 
  now fascism of course is nationalistic , completely opposed to multiethnic empires like the one of the tsar . 
  but finally the most important difference is about the authority of the leader , in fascism one should always obey the leader but the leader does not have to stay the same , the people/nation always needs a leader but if the people rebels against the leader it means that the leader has lost his `` mandate of heaven '' if you wish and another man ( probably the leader of the rebellion ) will take his place to guide the people/nation . 
  of course religion has nothing to offer to fascism and is a direct competitor to it , only the leader and through his the state/party should be obeyed to , god is dead . 
  i hope i made the basic differences clear enough , they are important enough to allow me to say that autocratism and fascism and completely different because of how opposed are their origins , power bases , legitimacy and concept of leader/people, 
  autocracy has nothing to do with fascism , that 's why i wished more people read about the fascist ideology . 
  it 's such a specific ideology and it could n't have emerged in russia because russian society did not have any of the criterias that allowed for fascism to grow . 
  indeed but as i answered somewhere else there is a big difference between what happened and the ideology in itself , the church would have been next in line after the jews once the war was over , one german officer who was part of the german resistance took great grief against the nazis when he heard one say `` first the jews , then the catholics '' ( the fact that this nazi failed to see that the protestants would be next always made me laugh ), 
  it 's way more complicated than that because there is a big difference between the ideology and what happened in real life , for example communism is internationalist but the ussr was very nationalistic and russification was at an all time high under it . 
  ideologicaly fascism wanted to get rid of the bourgeoisie as the means of production should belong to the people , that does not mean that industrialists would disappear , those people would work for the state 's industries as a people needs great men to lead it ( see the logic ? ), 
  what happened in real life is of course completely different , the bourgeoisie was used and used fascism to further both side 's ends but you can bet that the bourgeoisie as we know it would have been crushed after it was not needed anymore . 
  thank oyu so much , now i understand why serbia really wanted to keep it and above all , why so many people supported kosovo 's independence when its claim to do so was dubious at most ... 
  it 's funny that neofascists revere russia as the last `` fortress of christendom '' when fascism was an explicit ennemy of religion . 
  the big differences between communism and fascism are in ideology ( internationalism vs nationalism , support coming from the low class vs the middle class , etc. . . ) but their methods are roughly the same . 
  if you lived in the 30s you 'd think the fascists movements were leftist , not extreme right , they denounced the high bourgeoisie , the churches , etc. . . just like the communists did . 
  i really recommend pierre milza for a complete understanding of fascism , his books `` the italian fascism , 1919-1945 '' and `` fascism ** s ** '' ( emphasis mine ) are really great to understand the political landscape of the late 10s to the late 40s in europe , after reading the book you realize how foolish it was for the conservatives to try to manipulate fascism when the movement was so opposed to them . 
  please remember that planes are routinely checked and old parts are changed , this a320 probably only shares its name with the one 24 years ago , each and every single screw has been changed over the years , it 's a bit like [ theseus ' ship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ship_of_theseus ), 
  amelia del mar has one , i used to go there with my parents , we were \u00b1 200-300 french people on summers . 
  around barcelona there are multiple french villages built in the 70s-80s where french people built their homes when it was dirt cheap to do so . 
  a lot of these people are now older and go there to live permanently . 
  because trotsky and lenin were so much better with their invention of the gulag ? 
  or mao was better with his great leap forward ? 
  you 're like a guy saying `` nazism is n't bad , only hitlerism is '' the ideology is rotten to the core, 
  hahaha ... 
  ever heard of russification ? 
  `` who had this crazy idea to one day invent school ? 
  it 's this damn ( affectionate ) charlemagne !, 
  it 's a very popular song for young children to sing in france . 
  [ can you hear it in the wind ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97b4oa85pdo ), 
   it 's a danish study . 
  what a surprise, 
  wait i do n't know a lot about romania but why do they need to import oil ?
