  do n't they have the biggest oil field in europe ( bessarabia ) ? 
  funnily enough i saw an arab woman once telling her son that he was `` working like an arab '' and that he should be more serious , that made me laugh, 
  remember that in 2000 the fall of the soviet union was still fairly recent , a lot of that loss of number can be attributed to cold war-era hardware being decommissioned, 
  there wo n't be a war . 
  that 's why a lot of countries wanted cyprus to unify before joining , iirc northern cyprus agreed but not south cyprus and greece threatened to veto everything until cyprus was accepted . 
  and that 's why the deputies that agreed to the surrender were executed after the war , why p\u00e9tain and laval were sentenced to be hangued and why the new republic 's constitutions 's authorize the president to take dictactorial powers to insure that the country will honor it 's alliances . 
  that 's not at all how it works , countries are legally forced to obey their international engagement , in france the president of the republic can even seize dictactorial powers to ensure that the country honor its alliances ( article 16 of the fifth republic ) . 
  these are not pieces of paper , the ability to honor treaties is what makes the difference between a real country and a banana republic . 
  reddit geostrategists like you always make me laugh , military alliances are probably the most serious treaties a country can sign and not honoring one would destroy all credibility for this country it 'd be less harmfull for it to declare bankruptcy, 
  you forgot `` by all the means in their power '' which pretty much says `` we are going to nuke you '' in a polite way . 
  so spain will ask for reparations for guernica ? 
  good , i prefer comic duos than stand up comedians, 
  most people around here seem to forget that you can not attack an eu country just because it 's not part of nato , the eu is a military alliance :  7 . 
  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states .

  article 42 of the treaty of lisbon , if finland is attacked france and the uk are obligated to intervene and they are both nuclear states which russia can not afford to attack . 
  finland is a member of the eu as such eu members are mandated to protect finland in case of an attack , that includes france and the uk two nuclear states, 
  you mean except for all the 5000 kebab restaurants per square meters that also sell hamburgers ? 
  because their legitimacy as absolute rulers comes from islam , if no one believes in divine right of the monarch anymore you get what happened to poor louis xvi ... 
  muslim women did n't wear a veil for centuries before the islamic revival of the 60s-70s , my grandfather worked as a nuclear scientist in algeria and my grand mother always told me that even the old women in the countryside did n't wear veils at all . 
  people seem to forget that islam was nearly dead only a century ago , it 's only under the house of saud that a great revival of the religion happened . 
  the burka is part of the afghani culture and has nothing to do with either islam or arabic traditions/cultures . 
  yeah but in primary school my teacher told us that julius caesar was the first roman emperor , you do n't need a lot of qualification to become a maitre d'\u00e9cole ... 
  the part about romania having an alliance with poland , the tv guy did n't know about it and hitler goes on a rant like : `` oh but of course !, 
  herr general does not have the time for rumania !, 
  herr general sees only warsaw and krakow and he must hurry because in 30 days the french and british will have fully mobilized and will roll over germany if poland is n't crushed by then !, 
  but what 's this ? 
  while herr general was finishing his job in poland and turning to face france and britain a million bullets tore through his men and hundreds of thousands of pure german warriors have fallen !, 
  do not tell me that herr general forgot that poland had a military alliance with rumania ?! '', 
  besides the nuremberg trials already showed that a country does not have to sign a treaty to be bound by it ( the german leadership was condemned for violating the 1907 hague convention despite germany never signing it ), 
  nah it 's more like vicky 's infamy system nowadays , seems like we are heading right for a crisis war or a containment war ... 
  that is part of a speech hitler makes to a tv guy in `` look who 's back '' it 's pretty funny . 
  man remember when the euro got bigger than the pound for like a couple of weeks ? 
  that was fun, 
  did n't kill malta and they are extremely reliant on fishing . 
  basically the eu finances malta 's fishing economy so that it can develop aquacultures and fisheries that are n't harmful to the environment by being self-sustaining , malta 's economy is extremely dependent on fishing so you can understand why it 's so important to them . 
  they also finance training programs so that fisheries employees are more skilled to reduce waste ( a huge problem if i recall correctly in the fishing industry ) the eu also finances marketing campaigns to the public to make lesser-known species more in demand . 
  it 's a fairly good deal in my opinion but that it with a pinch of salt as i do n't know a lot about the fishing economy of europe . 
  not having your currency crash because a couple of banks failed ? 
  good luck living in china and not speaking mandarin , sure you can stay in the tourist part of the city where shopkeepers can articulate a bit of english but you 'll definitly find yourself in situations where absolutely no one can speak in english . 
  good thing we got the charles de gaulle now !, 
  haha this is hilarious !, 
  i can imagine jacouille la fripouille reading this !, 
  no one shed a tear except those same countries when they realized they were now alone against germany 20 years latter , munich would not have happened if the danubian federation existed . 
  r/european is different from r/european ** s **, 
  my country ( france ) did it , twice actually , once in 1918 and another time in 1945 just to be sure ... = /, 
  this is extremely heartbreaking , i always thought that the biggest mistake the allies made after ww2 was stooping to the level of the nazis and doing exactly like them : targeting people because of their ethnic origins . 
  sudeten had been living there for thousands of years and now , their culture , dialect , everything that made them what they were , has been wiped out in less than a couple of generations . 
  let 's not even talk about prussian culture , which was very specific and their dialect was unique ... congrats to russia , poland , lithuania and the czech republic for showing us that you do n't need to kill one person to wipe out a people . 
  ok then poland needs to give back to germany silesia , danzig and prussia as well as formally apologize for expelling the germans who lived there ... 
  ok , who harpooned a comet a few months ago ? 
  damn !, 
  my bad for some reason i always thought cold fusion meant it was fusion that created more energy than lost , i 'm sorry for the confusion, 
  the iter project is being built in france, 
  haha !, 
  well done !, 
  but get back to work !, 
  why do we have to wait so much for iter godaaaaaaaamit ???!, 
  close minded ? 
  europeans ? 
  remind me again , who managed to harpoon a comet ? 
  who is building the first cold fusion reactor ? 
  who built the lhc ? 
  you mean like ... the world wide web ? 
  `` whatched by all of europe '' really ? 
  the only time i watched was when i lived in australia because people were obsessed by it over there for some reason ... 
  just when i was glad that i would n't have to change my phone to move to germany, 
  oh man i 'm so sorry , i really honestly did n't want to appear rude at all !, 
  it 's just that a few weeks ago i realized one of the public works in my town was financed by the eu with a ridiculously small note on a random board near where the work was taking place and i then started to look for it more . 
  i 'm really sorry if i offended you but understand that english is n't my mothertongue so i do n't really know what i typed wrong to make my comment appear hostile . 
  go to your local charity , huge public work , welfare program provider , etc. . . you 'll always find a liiiiiittle note saying `` financed by the european union '' . 
  did n't lenin make russia switch to the gregorian calendar ? 
  so no one ever loses their job and has to wait for maybe a month or two before finding another in germany ? 
  are foreigners exempted from paying taxes that finance the welfare system then ? 
  now that 's just plain mean, 
  [ milk for the khorne flakes ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8064/8242180142_07dd69a597.jpg ), 
  except in eu4 pus have a leader, 
  did n't east timor actually * want * to stay portuguese and you guys basically forced them to be independent ? 
  tell that to all the `` i 'm 1/64th irish '' americans who always come here ... 
  millions of civilians did not die you idiot , the last time millions of civilians died in a war was in ww2, 
  no , just the guy who bothers to inform himself and knows that the eu 's lack of executive federal power is what makes it a confederation instead of a federation . 
  oh but you 're right , why bother ? 
  why think for yourself when all the politicians tell you it 's `` brussels 's fault '' without ever being more precise ? 
  stop lying and educate yourself the eu does not have this power nor did it ever force ireland to do anything, 
  the michelin tiremaker and star rating agency are completely different companies , the explanation is that france has had a very long fascination with japan for a long time . 
  my grand parents have a very traditional h\u00f4tel particulier ( with louis xv furniture ) and they have japonisme furniture in there as well . 
  we are the world 's second manga market after japan , some japan-only games only ever get translated in french , etc. . . 
  thanks ... did we just have a civilized conversation on reddit ? 
  dude these quotes you are citing are from public speeches , of course hitler would not trash christianity in public ... 
  alright so i agree with you that desertion existed of course , but not until the very end as i said , let 's take january 1945 as the beginning of `` the very end '' ( 5 months before the fall of berlin ) . 
  first you pointed out that even in the ss there was desertion ( even if somewhat small ) you have to remember that by 1944 the waffen ss was turned from an elite corp of fanatical soldiers to a sort of `` german foreign legion '' with white russians , georgians , baltic independentists ( remember that germans were seen as liberators against the soviet annexation of the baltic states in 1939 ) , etc fighting in it . 
  ( a funny example , the last defenders of hitler 's bunker in berlin were the french ss from the `` charlemagne '' division ) . 
  i disagree that germans surrendered `` in droves '' compared to other fighting forces germans had a far lower surrendering rate but yes i agree with you that it would have been so much better for germany if they were all a bunch of fanatics willing to die for the cause . 
  finally your last point is spot on , not only did the junkers ** hate ** hitler and nazism and tried multiple times to have them deposed ( especialy before the munich agreements and then after stalingrad ) . 
  the junkers ' mindset was best summed up i think by von mannstein who despised having to obey such a `` cretin '' as he said . 
  but you have to remember that it 's this same defiance of hitler that allowed the german field commanders to be so successfull , they dared take actions against their orders because they knew of a more effective way of doing things and had they been fanaticaly loyal things might have been much worse for germany . 
  the battle of berlin is really not a good example to take and you know it , the ss were executing people left and right for no reasons, 
  not really , the german army and the ss never stopped fighting until the very end so more fanatism would not have saved them .
