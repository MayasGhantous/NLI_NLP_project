i thought that the lithuanian one was a french specialty . 
  but the [ french wikipedia page ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a2teau_%c3%a0_la_broche ) says that it 's quite common in europe . 
  hollande is to communism what kim-jong un is to democracy .

  yeah , let 's do it once and for all , just for the people to understand that she was n't the solution . 
  what have we got to lose after all ? 
  5 years of our lives , 50 years of social progress and around 2 centuries of more or less freedom . 
  if it 's the only way for the stupid assholes who think she 'll save them from a crisis we just ca n't do anything about , then let 's vote for the third empire .

  but ... 
  this is a war you and my poor ancestors lost in 1453 . 
  the only problem is that the throne no longer exists . 
  that was funny so you 're more than forgiven . 
  that would make them think that we fantasize about their queen . 
  only the commonwealth 's population can be this kinky . 
  [ i 'm surprised not to see the french as `` inhibited german '' .

  what 's the point of learning other languages anyway ? 
  what 's the point in still speaking our native languages when english is enough for the whole planet ? 
  what 's the point in discovering other cultures and keeping them alive ? 
  what 's the point in life ? 
  the good king [ raoul ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudolph_of_france ) . 
  mostly because he 's from my hometown , was also duke of burgundy and has the most unkingly name for a king . 
  it 's like playing civ iv . 
  how much $ is 500 py6 ? 
  what made me think they did was the fact that we hear a lot about china for the last few days as its president was here in france and some journalists talked about his supposed `` friendship '' with vladimir poutine and stuff , my opinion may have been biased thanks to that . 
  as i said , it was a dumb question from someone not knowing much about relations between two `` elected '' dictators . 
  dumb question , but what if china was part of the equation ? 
  it might be a good thing to feel superior to russia but if the goal is to say that we should n't be frightened , i 'm still , due to their close ties to prc . 
  i thought worse , we could put some kind of device inside the ship that would be remote controlled to fuck things up on demand if we had to give the fuckers a lesson .

  i know ... 
  i 'm french and `` de rien '' does n't mean that ... 
  it was just humour , mate . 
  man , what always comes after `` thanks '' ?? 
  yes , `` you 're welcome '' . 
  i abolutely love the second one . 
  i wonder why we get different results on the same website . 
  not the first time i notice that , though . 
  edit : i think they meant to type `` what is france famous for '' , sounds more logical to me . 
  well , you know ... [ france is the most and least arrogant country in europe according to french . 
  why do people wonder why we 're [ famous ] ( http://www.nixtedoen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fuckmeimfamous.jpg ) ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  edit : these are the results i get on [ google.fr ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hqmmn4q.jpg ) and [google.com ] ( http://i.imgur.com/chwj2dw.jpg ) . 
  mmmh , well first , thanks for correcting my bad english , that 's sadly a word i do n't use a lot ( i should have checked before using it : / )  well , his role is his to choose . 
  indeed , but can he pretend being a comedian only when he 's spending so much time on other stuff ? 
  i do n't mind humorists giving some place to a message of any kind in their shows , even if it 's the part i like the less when it happens , but focusing on that when the show is over is more dramatic than funny to me . 
   i 'm just trying to find out what weighed on your current vision on the matter . 
  i guess that my other comments may be a clue if you really want to check my history , but to sum it up quickly , i used to love what he did , was extatic when he appeared on tv or did minor roles in movies , i even went to the cinema to see this awful movie `` hs '' just because he was in it , i mean , i used to love this fucking guy . 
  and then , controversy appears , but do n't worry , pals , he 's just playing with it , he likes to be in provocation , that 's his job , come on , he 's not like that . 
  until i could n't find any more excuse and started to understand that he turned like that . 
  other pals told me the exact same speech i was giving before but no , that could n't do the trick anymore . 
  now i just want him to limit to humour , to something he was good at , and to stop all the chit chat about jews and stuff , that 's more than enough . 
  but when i say that , i want him to do it by himself and wake up saying `` the heck did i do , i 've gone to far , guys '' , not because the government will tell him to . 
   he 's pretty much the last french comedian trying to educate the people through his shows and humor . 
  is it his role ? 
  what is his legitimity ? 
  what if i disagree with his education discipline , words and method ? 
   i perfectly understand that you do n't appreciate his opinions ( we do n't want to start that debate here ) , someone else did , and i perfectly understand and respect that you appreciate them . 
   but saying his speech is venomous is quite wrong , when you know the man ends his shows with `` aimez-vous les uns les autres '' ( `` love each other '' ) . 
  once again , i 'm not even talking about his shows , but his behaviour outside . 
  i know that the ban is on his shows and this is why it 's the most ridiculous decision ever made in the last weeks by our government . 
  the speech i 'm talking about is the one about the sionists , the evil government sold to israel and so on , it 's between paranoid and ridiculous to me . 
  as long as it 's during a show , i 'm ok , when it 's in an interview , i find it hard to stand for it . 
  indeed , not sure if parano\u00efa or pure racism . 
   and think he 's not clever ... anymore . 
   they do n't have things in common i do think that they have things in common , and that 's an opinion . 
  and i maintain the first part as an opinion too , i really feel it like it , so even if she said she hates him for a fact , i have the feeling and opinion she 's her best supportive ally in their close fights . 
  i 'd say , to express the most i can what i think and that makes it my opinion , that they 're each other 's pawn in the game of french politics debate . 
  to me , and that 's just an opinion , they 're like two sides of a sword 's blade . 
   then you do n't know much about the fn ... 
  i was talking about the dieudonn\u00e9 's posse . 
  the fn was the one against the umps , you should know that . 
   please get some facts before saying anything , this is boring . 
  sorry for giving my honest opinion instead of doing what you do and flooding with links to defend fn 's cause . 
   which conspiracies are you talking about ? 
  i already said that , the umps conspiracy on one hand , the sionist conspiracy on the other , if you do n't even read me , do n't bother answering . 
  i was in a pretty good mood talking to you for once , now you ruined everything . 
   with what other ways did he answer ? 
  lots of politics videos , interviews about politics , the quenelle . 
  none of them i can consider being humour . 
   do you think he should not do anything but humour ? 
  i do , desproges was incredibly clever ; coluche cared for good causes , dieudonn\u00e9 should have kept his ideas for him . 
   i 'm surprised the crif hate so much jokes on the holocaust ... why do n't they just answer with humour ? 
  is the crif similar to the jamel comedy club ? 
  wait , [ yes , they are ] ( http://oumma.com/16854/nouveau-president-crif-considerait-victoire-de-pen-200 ) ( see , i put a link , this time , but i 'm sure that you wo n't find it as much funny as i do ) . 
   he never said anything like this . 
  i know , man , ca n't you relax a second ? 
  it 's just a shortcut to explain what his behavior is . 
   as you 've said multiple times in this thread you do n't know shit about dieudonn\u00e9 , so you should look for some info instead of saying lies . 
  sorry , i did n't know that it was forbidden to have an opinion on someone when the only things you know about him is that he used to be a cool guy who 's become really irritating . 
  and it 's not true that i do n't know shit , please , i did n't just arrive here saying `` who 's that dieudonn\u00e9 guy ? 
  '' , you 're the one saying lies , here . 
  typical from the party you 're defending so much . 
  edit : oh , i see that the dieudonn\u00e9 up/down brigade is watching us , where are we on ? 
  / r/france ?
