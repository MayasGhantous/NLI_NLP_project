so are we good now ? 
  yep , [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cdx8zoghi0 ) is a scene from season 1 ( spoilers : heinsenberg visits tuco ) in french . 
  although more and more channels propose to see shows in original version with subtitles now . 
  there are some decents at 0.30 $, 
  and programs . 
  ( le dessous des cartes / mit offenen karten ) and series , surprisingly , it 's arte that broadcasts breaking bad in france . 
  good for you, 
  now that i 'm thinking about `` we '' do that aswell , i guess it just depends on the person/context !, 
  funny thing is , it 's a common saying in france too . 
  well , if you pass someone , you leave your turn signal until you are back in the `` correct '' lane . 
  then again , we can forget about it too . 
  am i talking too loud ? 
  you little ... 
  interesting , although with a little mistake i guess . 
  my eyes were caught by lens , which is a city in the north of france , and quite far away from sweden . 
  [ here is the wikipedia entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lens ) , you can see that the swedish numbers and swedish casualties were in fact french soldiers fighting the spanish . 
  i 'm sure it 's still a swedish-french victory as they were allies for a while , but there were no swedish soldiers in lens . 
  tldr : you 're welcome sweden , we 'll accept some of your women as payment !, 
   ok , fine , she was protesting the arrest of pussy riot , but why go out and destroy property that is not hers ? 
  i agree . 
   just because hollande is a socialist and the people were murdered by the union of socialist republics ? 
  nope . 
  for now , only shevchenko said that she was granted asylum , she showed the documents , and it seems valid , but the ofpra ( french office for refugees and `` stateless '' people ) did n't confirm anything . 
  they 'll probably comment on it later . 
  snowden , show your tits and you 're in !, 
  in france , the `` news '' is covered as her protesting the arrest of the pussy riot girls by taking down an orthodox cross . 
  no mention of it being a memorial for victims of the nkvd . 
   do i have now infer that the french government encourages pissing onto the memory of the victims of totalitarian regimes that are responsible for about 100 millions dead in the xx century alone ? 
  hey , shut up , you are infering too much . 
  need to reroute a plane ? 
   while china tops the list of countries engaging in cyber-espionage , according to a report published february ** by the us secret services ** , france shares second place with russia and israel [ sure ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wulybxd.gif ) edit : while the france24 article says `` countries engaging in cyber-espionnage '' , i found out that this report is in fact about countries * targeting the us * ( according to the us ) in cyber-espionnage , which explains france , russia and israel ( ? ), 
  second place .

   a 52-year-old french mother was caught trying to sit an english exam for her 19-year-old daughter on wednesday wonder why ... 
  it 's actually common , the [ royal coat of arms of the united kingdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_united_kingdom ) contains the motto `` dieu et mon droit '' ( god and my right ) , other example : `` honi soit qui mal y pense '' . 
  was n't it 10 instead of 5 ? 
  edit : [ yes it was !, 
   ( by muslims apparently ? 
  not sure where they got that one from ) . 
  [ no idea ] ( http://www.hyscience.com/archives/fox_news_muslim_riots.jpg ), 
  latvia cooperates . 
  gives sad and dead sons, 
  `` after saving money for a whole 2 weeks , the pope just bought cyprus . '', 
  for the sake of objectivity : . the bits that are not from the interview are from a member of a political party ( upr ) that wants to get france out of the european union , the euro zone ... . the interview is completely legit , although not complete [ ( complete interview in french ) ] ( http://www.rue89.com/2013/02/28/le-president-islandais-trop-de-banques-cest-une-mauvaise-nouvelle-240109 ) . 
  it 's quite interesting , talks about youngs in iceland , the fact that what worked in a country of 320k inhabitants may not in a country of 60 millions ... etc . i would to know what icelandic people think of their president, 
  31st of august - 1st of september , there is `` la braderie de lille '' ( north of france , near belgium ) , for what is probably the biggest flea market in europe , with over 2 million visitors . 
  kind of cool , now i want mussels and chips though ... 
  what are you guys plotting & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  to be honest , medias , in general , will always talk about the `` loudest '' commentary , the most extreme . 
  that 's why we always hear about extremists , they are not a majority , they are just making noise . 
  it sells more to write `` look at what this guy shockingly said about muslims '' than `` today a jew , a muslim and a christian had a cofee together and talked about cultural immigration in europe '' . 
  sure , those comments make me angry , and to be honest , i 'm surprised to see so much hate on r/europe . 
  but i like to see different views , although i would prefer some more discussion and less `` islam is evil '' kind of stuff . 
  woah ... you went there ... 
  the article seems fair to me . 
  low-cost airlines usually use smaller airports , where the `` terminal '' is just a big warehouse . 
  does n't matter ; had fries, 
  and i 'm quite sad/surprised to see your comment downvoted so much ... 
  fight back what ? 
  islam is n't an ennemy . 
  extremists are the problem , whatever their religion is . 
  the only thing you 're gon na achieve by burning korans ( sorry but that 's probably the stupidest idea i 've heard today ) is getting the hatred of moderate muslims , people like you and me who are just muslims and wo n't put the koran down your throat , that never asked you anything . 
  and you will only help these extremists convincing more people : `` look , they are burning our sacred books ! '', 
   there is usually some negative daily news item in europe related to islam every day now . 
  and i only hear about bad cops in the us , so all cops are pigs right ? 
  the medias also have his share of the guilt , always talking about bad things happening . 
  if i only listen to the main medias , i would have a pretty poor vision of the world . 
   senior pirate party politician julia schramm made headlines this week when her publisher took action against pirated copies of her book `` click me . '', 
  is n't it just the publisher `` protecting '' the things he paid for ? 
  what has she actually done apart from being hypocrite ? 
  posting abusive emails on her blog ? 
  so she 's just being hypocrite because she uses the system she 's `` fighting '' against ? 
  i think the saddest part is that it seems the pirate party will end up like every other political party ... filled by a bunch of ... well ... politics ... 
  funny , a `` bouffe '' is a ` slang ' - term for a `` meal '' / `` diner '' , to eat ... 
  do n't know what they would be afraid of ... it 's not like someone understand them ... 
  ahah indeed . 
  reminds me of that discussion i had a couple of months ago , i had with a german friend explaining wwii to a mexican friend . 
  we then realised that our grandfathers , well , were trying to kill each other . 
  ended up telling her : `` glad they both sucked at it '', 
  ahahah , always wanted to hear wwii jokes from the german pov . 
  that 's great . 
   `` see ? 
  we were right !, 
  the jews control everything !, 
  even the anti-semitic far right party ! '', 
  those were the names of the dogs, 
  every single day every word you say every game you play every night you stay i 'll be watching you ( this one does n't even need any change ), 
  [ link ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/countries/8664268/bosnia-herzegovina-london-2012-olympics.html ) . 
  so yeah , it 's legit ... 
  i think the sentences are like `` what to say if you meet bosnian people during the games ! '' . 
  if you put all the sentences in google translate from serbian ( yeah i know ) to english , it works out . 
  the national anthem comes from the [ wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dr%c5%beavna_himna_bosne_i_hercegovine )  ottomans ; nazis ; serbs ... then tony blair yeah , i got nothing for that . 
  to be honest , i 'm seeing that as an intern not giving a shit about it , doing that late at night after belarus , benin , butan ... etc. . . 
  i 'm gon na check out some other pages , could be fun ... ** edit : ahahah that 's hilarious ** france in six words : `` losing wars , losing heads , still smoking '' mexico in six words : `` teotihuacan , mayans , aztecs ... downhill after spanish '' ** edit ** on the mexican page : `` it 's not the winning that matters , it 's the taking part '' `` no es la victoria que importa , es la parte de tomar '' . 
  ahaha , for those not speaking spanish , the spanish phrase can be translate like that : `` it 's not the victory that matters , it 's the part where we drink '' mauritania in six words : `` thirty-year war . 
  then 315 years off . '', 
  monaco in six words : `` french invasion . 
  nazi invasion . 
  socialite invasion . '', 
  shit i 'm definitely gon na read all the pages now ... thank you !,
