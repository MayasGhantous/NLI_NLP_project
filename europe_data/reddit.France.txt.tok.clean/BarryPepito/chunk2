  also he plays on the double meaning of `` rendre '' : giving back ( like money for example ) and `` se rendre '' : surrender ( like in the original french saying ), 
  lending my french laptop to foreign friends is quite fun i 'll admit . 
  or as they would say : `` zhere qre , y letters -- '', 
  that 's the problem ...

  still not arrested at 4pm . 
  they report that they found explosives in the car of the suspect 's brother . 
  * sigh . . *, 
  is that an actual ad ? 
  `` he speaks french too ! '', 
  is this a joke ? 
  bah , i 'll be honest , i do n't plan to go to the us anyway ... edit : re-reading my comment , it may sounds a bit something-something-bad . 
  i 'm just a bid `` sad '' about the us situation . 
  i would love to visit but , i do n't know , i would n't feel good . 
  actually , if the objective is that no one come into the us ... mission accomplished ... 
  til  skype was founded in 2003 by janus friis from denmark and niklas zennstr\u00f6m from sweden . 
  [ 11 ] the skype software was developed by estonians ahti heinla , priit kasesalu and jaan tallinn , who were also behind the peer-to-peer file sharing software kazaa . 
  [ 12 ] in april 2003 , skype.com and skype.net domain names were registered . 
  in august 2003 , the first public beta version was released . 
  well , thanks , i wo n't sleep well tonight ... 
  be afraid malta ... be afraid . 
  please segolene , get the fuck out . 
  a macaronesian region is probably not what i think , right ? 
  i love you then ( ps : i 'm a bit drunk , so if you 're a guy , i love you as a bro ), 
  sorry , could n't resist . 
  i want my news media to be focused on what they should do : news coverage , verified news . 
  if i 'm watching tv , i do n't want the anchor to tell me to log on facebook to learn this or more !, 
  i 'm watching you now , so tell me !, 
  and no , facebook & twitter are still not a viable source for me . 
  of course they can use it , people have officials pages , but their job is to verify the news . 
  the medias nowadays are in a race for who 's gon na be the fastest to inform . 
  that 's cool , but i got facebook too . 
  i think it 's important that they stay focused on what they are telling people , and not the way they are telling . 
  and yes , these are brands , this law , even if it 's a old one that would really need a little refresh , it keeps ads out of my news tv . 
  of course , i do n't agree 100 % , there should be a better way to do that , but hey , ca n't have everything . 
  first , i 'm not a facebook/twitter hater , i use them both , and like them a lot . 
  now , the reasons : *** `` want to know the first reason ? 
  follow me on my facebook page !, 
  '' *** --  [ link ] ( http://www.komrod.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/troll-face.png ), 
  i 'm good with that . 
  and next what ? 
  close the borders ? 
  refuse any contact with other countries ? 
  i just hope this trend will stay in the far-right movement and wo n't give ideas to some people of the ump . 
  hungary , 12 points, 
  get in touch with the camara de commercio de us in spain , seems to be [ this ] ( http://www.amchamspain.com/site/ ) , tell them your situation and they 'll tell you what you can do for the visa and ( normally ) give you contact for us companies in spain . 
  we could make an arrangement ... we should meet ... btw , i 'm absolutely not a serial killer . 
  not at all . 
  * raises hand *, 
  canada would fits . 
  or australia , so we would have a country far away where we could just move and work easily , without all the visas problems ... 
  do n't like it ... / french ps : nah , it 's fine . 
  sorry to hear that , it sucks : / unfortunately , you 're not the first nor the last ... maybe one day ... 
  well , i 'm sure you heard that before , but i do n't think it 's the case everywhere . 
  had some romanian teachers here , also some people i know went to romania for an intership . 
  never heard `` bad '' things about romania , but of course , there are morons everywhere ... ( i 'm from france btw ) . 
  care to share the stories ? 
  due to the roms you think ? 
  yeah , well , i did n't fully wake up and read your sentence as : `` why is every subreddit spammed with stupid superbowl bullshit ... '', 
  well , to be fair , she did n't sing very well . 
  plus people usually do n't like when a mainstream artist sing a cover of a `` classic '' song ( sweet child o ' mine in this case ) . 
  and well , it 's in r/wtf , 
  superbowl is a massive event watched by 100 millions of people . 
  the game was ( for once ) really good . 
  aguilera butchered the american anthem . 
  the half-time show by the black-eyed peas was not great . 
  and as usual , some fun superbowl-ads . 
  personally , i watched it for the game . 
  by listening to christina aguilera , i think they are learning ... 
  meh ... france is ok , a bit cold though ... 10am , & at work . 
  i should probably work on that report now, 
  but it will be on an blue background , i think the yellow one fits better, 
  mmm ... our uk neighbours wo n't like that ... 
  i do, 
  but they will take your beers and then laugh at your accent, 
  ahah , unfortunately yes : / but you guys are welcome in rijsel !, 
  yeah , indeed , we like to complain , but at least , we can , hurray for democracy !, 
  anyway , this kind of link makes me sick , and sad ... 
   islamic threats are successful because of events like the three weeks of riots and car burning by young muslim males that took place in 2005 . 
  what ? 
  i mean ... i 'm french so i was there , since when did muslims had something to do with the riots ? 
  that 's just not true ... edit : oh i see , racist & poorly informed article ... : /, 
  damn you ruined everything !, 
  yeah , i just saw that . 
  and anyway , i have n't seen one of those new coins . 
  they made 4 millions of them ... 
  i do n't see the point now ... 
  ahah , it 's a funny little game to try to collect them all . 
  since september , they also added a 10-euros coin per region ( 26 ) here in france . 
  good luck finding them !, 
  i like how the sncb tries suddenly to defend the women rights and forget about the sentence, 
  you do n't seem to hold france in great esteem, 
  you 're not dutch ? 
  then , if i may , where do you come from ? 
  are you living in holland ? 
  whoah ... talking about real class and geert wilders in the same thread ... quite contradictory ... 
  i know ... but having no idea if my bus/train will come or if i 'll be stuck hours in traffic jams in order to go to work made me lose all my taste for poetry ... 'cause yes , there is a lot of people still working ... 
  since when there is no youtube in turkey ?
