  also , that does n't tourism , which accounts for something like 15 % of their exports . 
  that 's going to boom more than ever before . 
  they * are * having a referendum . 
  these details need sorting out , and are very important . 
  russia always gets loads of votes from eastern europe - what europe are * you * living in ? 
  the `` powers that be '' in the uk understand that there is pro-eu sentiment at the moment and an early referendum is almost certain to come out in favour of staying . 
  this is excellent news . 
  it 's not just the uk who are wary of * all in * . 
  look at the polls around the lisbon treaty and you can see that most of the european population are n't ready for it yet . 
  give it time . 
  i do n't agree that 's very close . 
  if that were the result in an election , it would be called a landslide . 
  blair/major was 42 % / 30 % in 1997 . 
  the majority of the papers and other news media will also be campaigning against leaving , and the last-minute deciders will undoubtedly go with keeping the status quo , as we saw in the scottish referendum . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's impossible , it 's just a very improbable decision for the people of britain to make . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#standard_polling_on_eu_membership this is more optimistic . 
  whichever way you look at it , it 's not great for the out camp when you consider the barrage of in-priopaganda we 'll be hit with come 2017 . 
  not according to the polls , more like 55/35 with 10 undecided . 
  [ the polls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#standard_polling_on_eu_membership ) say you are wrong . 
  i also live in the uk and i can tell you that the vast majority of my friends want to stay in . 
  and the pro-eu campaign will be even stronger . 
  we really have to stop this misunderstanding . 
  the uk people and government are not against membership of the eu . 
  just look at the polls and the party manifestos . 
  the uk also do n't have that interest . 
  they are n't . 
  you should stop believing everything you read in the papers . 
  the british people are generally not against staying in the eu . 
  it 's all about power in parliament . 
  the tories have a strong backbench anti-eu sentiment , so cameron has to appease them by offering one . 
  but , as a referendum , it 's still down to the population , who are very in favour of staying . 
  the treaty referendums are not in the same league as in/out . 
  if there were in/out referendums in those countries they would all be massively in favour of staying . 
  by what mechanism will you go ? 
  considering that the uk population is very pro-eu . 
  still the best healthcare in the world though !, 
  it would have to be a massive swing the other way for the uk to leave . 
  a large majority of the population are in favour of staying . 
  unlike the fptp system , a referendum is proportional . 
  there 's no appetite for leaving amongst the population , and this decision can only be done by referendum . 
  he 'll be campaigning to stay in whatever he 's offered , but he has to go through this to appease the eurosceptic backbenchers . 
  the negotiations are really just to define the parameters of the referendum . 
  this election almost guarantees the uk will remain a part of the eu . 
  the conservatives will hold a referendum in 2017 and will be heavily pro-eu in their campaigning . 
  on top of the [ current polls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#standard_polling_on_eu_membership ) showing low appetite for leaving , it all mounts up to a resounding vote to stay . 
  civ3 took up a fair amount of my time . 
  i still get cravings all these years past ... ah to hell with it , just one more move ... 
  correlating well with wealth . 
  well there was the obama `` hope '' image for one . 
  it would be interesting to see how that correlates with total debt . 
  [ the west would never do such a thing ... ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=putin+cartoon&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=4egivedjnmptaqixgbaf&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969 ), 
  the situation is not as you present , as we already have nato , which has a central command structure and experience in all sorts of military engagement . 
  according to the ecb , [ gdp for the last quarter of 2015 was 2624 billion ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/keyind/html/index.en.html ) , which is 10.5 k annualised , so that works out at 9 % . 
  i meant printing to the value of 10 % of eurozone gdp . 
   `` we have always said our purchases would run beyond end-september 2016 ** in case we do not see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below but close to 2 per cent ** , '' mr draghi said . 
  ( emphasis mine ) 13th november 2015 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mario-draghi-ecb-chief-signals-further-monetary-easing-as-deflation-fears-grow-a6732691.html, 
  actually i think it 's exactly for inflating the money supply . 
  the ecb is now printing 10 % of eurozone gdp . 
  oh man , we do n't need that attitude here . 
  i think people do really care about this - in fact there seems to be quite a panic . 
  i believe it 's a type of nut . 
  so the eu will never do free trade deals with india , china or the us ? 
  i 'm not saying it 's a bad thing , just that free trade could he offered to the uk without it , which they would almost certainly accept , to the benefit of both parties . 
  ok fine - i 'm sure there 's more to it . 
  but what i 'm suggesting is that you do n't need to have free movement of people to have a free trade deal . 
  why ca n't they be offered the same as we would offer any other country ? 
  but a free trade deal does n't have to be part of the union . 
  if the eu were to do a free trade deal with china , it would basically just be lowering customs duty . 
  why ca n't that be offered to the uk too ? 
  i do n't understand why lowering trade barriers necessarily includes free movement of people . 
  i mean , if we had a free trade deal with the us , we would n't expect them to agree to freedom of movement too . 
  i do n't understand why we ca n't just give them a free trade deal and be done with it . 
  it 's in the interests of everyone surely . 
  on thing to consider is that jpm and gs had vested interests in the uk staying - i.e. 
  they 'd bet money on it . 
  so their opinion is n't exactly unbiased . 
  the uk have already said that they would trigger article 50 in october , so i imagine they would just repeat that , which may end up with the eu leaders looking like fools ... 
  it should have been offered . 
  would have most probably stopped all this . 
  core eu countries could have their ever-continuing integration . 
  it 's been two days . 
  several countries got `` no '' votes in eu constitution referendums only for them reform it as the lisbon treaty and get it passed without their consent . 
  if this kind of thing destroys democracy then it 's already dead . 
  edit : the danes over maastricht also , i believe . 
  the quality of discussion here is exceptional . 
  i 'm also of this opinion , but the eu would need to move quickly to offer a permanent second tier of membership without ever further integration . 
  that 's the only way britain could stay in for good . 
  what do you mean by `` this would happen ? '', 
  as far as i can see , the pound is at the same level against the euro as it was two weeks ago , and the stock market only dropped by 3.5 % ( both of which need to be viewed in the context of a rise in the previous days due to people thinking that remain was gaining ground ) . 
  so i do n't really understand exactly what 's so bad about what has happened , especially in the context of the armageddon warnings of the previous few months . 
  now there 's a french reaction if ever i saw one !, 
  i 'd be very surprised if the eu could get that done within the timeframe it takes for the uk to trigger article 50 . 
  surprised and impressed . 
  the less educated are also the ones at the sharp end of immigration . 
  the more educated have been shown that even though they know more , they still view the world subjectively , and their world view is not the reality in the uk . 
  i do disagree , because i think you are confusing the meaning of `` irrational '' with something that people * think * is correct but is n't . 
  that 's not correct . 
  faulty rationale is not irrationality - it 's just being wrong . 
  being rational is about having reasons for something , having a basis , being founded in some sort of argument . 
  if that argument is wrong , it is still rational .
