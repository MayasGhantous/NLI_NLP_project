  some say rome , but it is not really a european capital , more a pan-mediterranean one . 
  i 'd rather go back to the frank/germanic roots in aachen / aix-la-chapelle . 
  on top of that , it would be easier to remember for future school children : charlemagne / karl the great / carlus magnus / charly the fat was made emperor in the year 800 .

  the ticket price was already expensive , and filling the planes was always a problem .

  never !, 
   there is no way it will ever been deemed safe for passenger transport again . 
  concorde was never ruled unsafe . 
  right after the accident , flights were temporary suspended during the inquiry but then resumed . 
  the problem is that it was designed to be a technical feat but was never that profitable . 
  when it was allowed back in service , travelers were more reluctant and the already tiny profits plummeted .

   it will take a very , very long time to clear all the mines from the war .

   deep throat is the pseudonym given to the secret informant [ ... ] in what came to be known as the watergate scandal . 
  there is a clear missed opportunity here . 
  that name should have been used for the lewinsky scandal instead . 
  i would call that `` state tv '' . 
  more like `` go fuck yourself ! '', 
  maybe , but i 'm talking about a comment . 
  in the comments :  one of them is the same guy who went to prison a couple of years back because he refused to divorce his wife . 
  he argued that she was his property under gods law . 
  i 'm not sure how reliable this , but ... wow . 
  just wow ... 
  the czech republic is n't federal either . 
  i agree that it 's not needed in a strict technical way , but it sends a more than necessary message . 
  on top of that , it may put victims more at ease when they may be emotionally at their worst .

   i find the video , in particular , very odd . 
  well , the lyrics are basically `` the sink is beautiful , the bidet is ugly '' looped over and over ... 
  [ wtf indeed ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bo_le_lavabo )  the lyrics are deliberately very poor . 
  in them , lagaf ' explains that , for producing a hit every year , changing the words is enough : the first year , we can sing `` il est beau le lavabo '' ( `` the sink is beautiful '' ) , the second year , `` il est laid le bidet '' ( `` the bidet is ugly '' ) , and the third year , we mix both versions . 
   the single was certified gold disc,

  that was a strange time ... 
  considering that french politicians who call themselves `` gaullistes '' do n't seam to agree on what it means ... 
  seeing the thumbnail , i will wait for someone to sacrifice themselves and explain here what it 's about ... & nbsp ; or i might just forget it . 
  i 'm pretty sure arabic was the language of migrants at the time too ... 
  what he means is that the map includes occitan for france but not arabic for spain ( anymore ) . 
  well , off-shore would imply an island , so ... the uk ? 
  the problem is that this is only one of it 's variants . 
  most of these maps present the situation as `` french vs. occitan '' . 
  the reality is that every region has it 's own regional language , some covering a wider area , others varying from village to village . 
  these languages are mostly separated in two families : language of oc ( occitan ) and language of oil . 
  french is only the variant of language of oil historically spoken in paris , imposed on everybody else by the centralized nature of the county politics . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=file:langues_de_la_france.svg&amp;lang=fr ) : occitan in red , language of oil in yellow & green , arpitan/franco-provencal in blue . 
   bulgarian is a rich language .

  ( if my uncle shaves your uncle , your uncle will be shaved . 
  - the `` d '' in `` tond '' is silent ) there is also a few poets that played with what is called `` holorime '' , i.e.

  let 's say that some canadians can be prouder than others to be `` america 's hat '' . 
  * brittany has a strong regional identity and has quite successfully pushed for more recognition . 
  for example the breton language might be the most widely taught regional language in school , even-though it is not really spoken . 
  there were a few historical clashes , such as anti-revolutionary rebellions .
