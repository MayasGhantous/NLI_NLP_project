  it is the less ridiculous one , but talking about an independentist push is still a bit far-fetched . 
  * the languages that used to be spoken in france can be separated in two families : the language of oil ( north ) and the language of occ ( south ) , named after how to say `` yes '' in each one . 
  there is a lot of regional variations in each one , and there is no clear-cut border between the two . 
  although some cultural phenomenons can be attached more to one or the other ( cooking with butter vs. with oil :p ) , neither is united anyway . 
  occitania may seam separated from france to the outsider , but it 's mostly because paris is in the other and french derivate from one variant of the oil language . 
  * if you want to tell an alsatian that he is not french , you better start running . 
  do n't even try telling them they are germans ... * i 'm actually from savoy ... 
  they sometime manage to gather one or two dozens people to do a pro-independence demonstration . 
  in the last one i saw , they where trying to stay as far as possible from each other to occupy more space . 
  of course each of these region has it 's share of lunatics , but `` regionalists '' are usually more concerned about changing the internal administrative borders . 
  it 's less independentisme than bickering with the neighbors . 
  corsica is quite serious at time , brittany is fathomable , you could add spanish basque independentists spilling to french basque country . 
  but most others are mostly laughed at in france ( including within their own regions ) , and the credit given to it on the internet feels to me a lot like some chronicle freedumb syndrome . 
  to some , they may look like minorities opposed to the french identity , but in fact the french identity is little more than the union of all these regional identities . 
  the main antagonism created by the centralized nature of the country is not peripheral regions against the rest , it 's more everybody against paris . 
  as for the hope for any of them to gain independence , the first article of the constitution says `` france is an indivisible republic '' ( * la france est une r\u00e9publique indivisible * ) . 
  lol bis, 
   brittany , occitania , alsace , savoy ( france ) lol,

  it is ruled by the uk , but not an official part of it . 
  it is not part of the eu either . 
  what do n't you understand about `` integral parts of france , of the european union '' ? 
  by your reasoning , most of [ these posts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=falkland&amp;restrict_sr=on ) should not have been allowed on / r/europe . 
  mayotte and r\u00e9union are integral parts of france , of the european union and of the euro-zone ( but not of the shengen area ) . 
  rather they do n't care . 
  if you expect the average guy to convert speed limits on the fly , it 's no surprised it failed .

   what kind of safety measures should they implement ? 
  i dunno ... making sure people where at a safe distance , having a way to warn bystanders as soon as it started to go wrong , ... 
  poontoon = floaty thingy barge = floaty thingy to transport heavy stuff, 
  sorry , i did not realize you where the same person . 
  but anyway , i had no more reason to assume one or the other , hence `` they '' being the correct pronoun .

  you can say they were thought to be adequate , that they followed the regulation , etc. 
  but you ca n't say that they were `` adequate '' when the thing they were supposed to stop plowed right through them . 
  ok ... `` they '' . 
  `` the authorities believe the safety barriers were adequate . '', 
  that they thought so beforehand , i can understand . 
  but how stupid do you have to be to say that after the fact ? 
  the problem is not that it fell and did serious damage . 
  when dealing with heavy machinery , especially cranes , shit happens . 
  the problem is that it fell on people because no adequate contingency plan or security measures were in place . 
  he may not know the english word ...
