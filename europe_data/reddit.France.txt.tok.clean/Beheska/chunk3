  you realise as you go that anything happy in the first part is only there to make the fall harder later on ... 
  i then tried to watch the latest movie , i simply could n't stand it . 
  * l\u2019\u00c9cume des jours * ( froth on the daydream / foam of the daze / spray of the days / mood indigo ) by boris vian warning : not for depressed people . 
  * le petit prince * ( the little prince ) by antoine de saint-exup\u00e9ry , often mistaken for a children book . 
  * tintin * by herg\u00e9 ( all of them , really ), 
  it 's really not a rumor , it 's a question ... 
  to simplify a lot , that interdiction is aimed at the state , not studies . 
  is there an xkcd relevant to the fact that there is an xkcd relevant to everything ? 
   byzantine empire  does not include byzantium, 
  french saying : `` and the fight stopped by lack of fighters . '', 
   i know all about litres , millilitres and all that . 
   turns out its a ` decilitre ' . 
  had to look that shit up . 
  had to look up what it meant . 
  well , you clearly do n't . 
  they are separated at high altitude . 
  that way , if the target has defences to shout down the missiles befor they hit , you increase the chances of at least one warhead detonating where you want . 
  smallest country : once you put the church in it , there is no room left :p, 
  good drivers ... as long as they are in germany . 
  as soon as they put a wheel outside their borders , they will run you out of the road . 
  for a moment , i was [ confused ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tender_%28rail%29 ) . 
  still do n't get it ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyfmwta5ye & nbsp ; ^ ( sorry ! ), 
   if 100 people out of a 20k speak a language they get their own color ? 
  imo , yes if it 's a language that can be somehow tied to a particular area and it 's current inhabitants . 
  it may look like i 'm rambling , but the french dialects presented are mostly seen as heritage rather than used . 
  people may use a few words in daily speech , understand what some toponyms means , but the language itself is not really spoken . 
  for most of them , calling them a language can even be kind of a stretch : in savoy , for example , there are variation from village to village . 
  you travel 10km and some things will be called by two completely unrelated names . 
  some other dialects , such as breton , are taught in school as an option . 
  but that does n't mean the people that know it actively use it . 
  and even then , it is an artificial creation based upon a collection of local variants , and the spelling taught comes from academia rather than historical usage . 
   it presents it as an actively speaking language this map does not show actively spoken language in any way . 
  i had no idea either / s seriously , even my grandparents ca n't speak anything else than french , although they might be able to get the general idea of a conversation in * patois * . 
  we have a few regional words that are commonly used , but dialects are seen as culture at best , not something you use . 
  they can just bully it into submission . 
  it 's turned into cheese . 
  there is a point where `` statistics '' stops being relevent . 
  well , considering that each region has it 's own puns for every single other region of france ... 
  most villages even have dedicated insults and jokes for their neighboors . 
   it would be a joke if u/i-fuck-horses were german . 
  since there 's no way to tell , how is your joke funny ? 
  he says his mom learned french `` that way '' while talking about french being taught in east germany . 
  also , his post history says he is . 
  no this is patrick . 
  in the alps , we have the dahu . 
  it looks like a chamois , but has the legs on one side shorter than on the other . 
  that way it is well suited to walk sideways on mountains , but you have clockwise and counter-clockwise dahus . 
  to hunt it , you have to go behind it : when you call it , it will turn and fall . 
  well , it would ... 
  god is not from any particular country ... 
  well , technically he was born in ireland , so at least it 's not a case of `` 1/253 irish '' . 
   you would n't believe how many people are scared to travel to europe because they think you hate and will berate them because they 're american . 
  i 'm not going to complain if these ones prefer to stat at home , though ... 
  here , funny = ironic and sad . 
  french love antiphrasis . 
  it 's on a wholly different scale , but the aim and the modus-operandi are the same . 
   i 'm not sure their mere existence is illegal . 
  unless you can show that they grouped with the purpose of doing illegal things . 
  you forgot one word : `` moderate '' . 
  you can add '' & t = 2h52m20s '' ( on youtube.com ) or '' ? t = 2h52m20s '' ( on youtu.be ) at the end of the url . 
  the problem is that with drm , you often end up paying for the inconvenience . 
  it 's not a legal issue but a purely economical one : pirated products are better and cheaper than those using drm . 
  it 's complicated ( and often awkward ) . 
  & nbsp ; * offer your hand . 
  * `` oh , he wants to kiss , ok then . '', 
  * offer your cheek . 
  * `` shit , he went for the other side . '', 
  * offer the other cheek . 
  * `` damn , he changed side too . '', 
  ... * finally pull back . 
  * `` wait , there 's more ? '', 
  repeat with each and every guest . 
  european gardeners to call for closer bush trimming . 
  it was swiss chocolate !, 
  because a country minting chocolate coins is not ? 
  in france , you will find [ * brasseries * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brasserie ) . 
  they usually have a limited menu of simple french cuisine . 
  apart for the occasional tourist trap or the really hyped ones , they are great value for money . 
  apparently norwegians like to take the interior . 
   of course there 's no `` pocs '' ( or `` pox '' for short ? ) . 
  it all makes sens now !, 
  that 's what the anti-vax movement is after !, 
  shhhh , stop making sense . 
  [ the same thing ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/disney+whitewashing_81a7bd_5179562.jpg ) have been said about disney ... 
  but strangely i never heard that miyazaki was racist for portraying only japanese people ... 
   honestly , as long as denmark is n't the capital city of a country called amsterdam , i 'm happy . 
  have you encountered a few american tourists recently ? 
  you can try [ le bon coin ] ( http://www.leboncoin.fr/sports_hobbies/offres/ile_de_france/ ) . 
  it 's not about scented pillows . 
  if you can interpret the law to include scented pillows , you can interpret it to include things that are less moronic sounding , but still ridiculous to ban ( and convict people over ) . 
  yep , that 's her job . 
  an interpreter should not filter anything . 
   things you 've said you like : jar jar i was talking about eating him ...  you are : practical federal smuggler ; spaceship pilot thanks / r/elitedangerous !, 
  and the pressure put on the steel . 
  same here . 
  precisely . 
  i 'm even providing them with an outlet for their pulsions . 
  please remind me : how long did you remain without a government ? 
  we call them fried apples : / ( from * pommes de terre * = earth apples ),
