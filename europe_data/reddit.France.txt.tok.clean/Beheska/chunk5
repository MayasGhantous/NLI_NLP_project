  agnosticism is admitting you do n't know , while atheism is stating there is noting . 
  for a lot of people , religion is not really about beliefs but about culture and belonging to a community . 
  croque monsieur is not made with the same kind of bread . 
  most like something to eat on the go , but it 's the archetype of the french sandwich : the `` jambon-beurre '' ( ham-butter ) . 
  half a * baguette * partly sliced in half , butter spread in it , eventually some pickle , and 2 slices of ham rolled . 
  if i 'm going to sit down and eat something hot , i 'm partial to fried eggs then cheese , with bread alongside all of that of course . 
   from their community i do n't need to say more : you yourself proved my point . 
   no other religion causes so much global upheaval what some make of it has nothing to do with the religion in itself being more of less prone to violence or extremism . 
  ever heard of the crusades and the inquisition ? 
   sikhs do n't even have a single state completely irrelevant to the situation in france . 
  and yes , in france muslims are more oppressed than other religions . 
  just look at what happened after the charly hebdo attack : they where pressured into publicly denouncing it because it was assumed that no special statement was equal to supporting it . 
  one of my roommates had to lie to his father for him to cosign the lease because my other roommate 's name sounds arabic . 
  you ca n't fight radicalization by treating them differently than other religions in refusing that the have places to gather ( they will still do ) . 
  it only has the opposite effect . 
  more mosques makes islam more public and as a consequence more integrated . 
   it might be an exaggeration to say only mosques breed extremism this is what he says , but not what he really means . 
  he uses flowed logic to imply that all mosques do . 
  the good old `` witches have black cats , she has a black cats , so she is a witch '' ... 
  could be [ worse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7mwuj7zla ) ( or more epic , depending of your point of view ) . 
  i would say quite french :p, 
  in the netherlands , ground level is already the basement :p, 
   a family feast in italy let me guess : lunch and supper merged in one single long meal ? 
  they do n't even shake hands : they use sticks instead . 
  i have family in paris , savoy , provence , auvergne . 
  most reunions start awkwardly , considering that even people from the same region ca n't seem to agree . 
  conclusion : belgians are odd !, 
  i ca n't really help you regarding the price , but be aware that most cars here have a manual gearbox . 
  if you want an automatic , you will have to specifically ask for it , and it might be a bit harder to come by . 
  you realize it 's only on the cheek , right ? 
  yeah , i saw that in one of the comments bellow ... 
  i just find it funny since it 's most likely a pure coincidence . 
  he may be going full eurasia-estasia : it is easier to control the population when you have a clearly defined enemy . 
   erdogan seems to think that europe is threatening turkey , and that turkey should be threatening europe . 
  if he continues that way , that could very well become a self fulfilling prophecy :(, 
   italy [ is ] significantly changed well , the old one was a fascist symbol ... 
  the polish one looks a lot like the old [ french stop signal for trains ] ( http://carreweb.fr/dsp/res200406/nsm_09.jpg ) . 
  basic conspiracy kind of stuff . 
  the only argument they have that points to an islamic attack is that there were two turks on board . 
  could as well have been gunned down by separatists from savoy / s, 
  why are there two white squares ? 
  in france , the ministers are often renewed as a whole , when the prime minister is sacked by the president . 
  since he is a sort of fuse to protect the public image of the president , that can happen quite a lot . 
  the top 2 ( i think ) have both 16 governments in a 7 years mandate , some governments lasting less than a month . 
  ( sorry for the links in french ) * under the president [ albert lebrun ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/historique_des_gouvernements_de_la_france#albert_lebrun.2c_pr.c3.a9sident_de_la_r.c3.a9publique_.281932-1940.29 ) ( last of the iii ^ ( th ) republic , just before ww2 ) counting his 2 ^ ( nd ) one year long mandate , that makes 20 governments . 
  * under the president [ vincent auriol ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/historique_des_gouvernements_de_la_france#vincent_auriol.2c_pr.c3.a9sident_de_la_r.c3.a9publique_.281947-1954.29 ) ( first of the iv ^ ( th ) republic , right after ww2 ) for some reason , both these regimes were considered particularly hard to govern ... 
  for once the european penis is not first \\ o /, 
  are you sure you want to be lumped with the belgians ? 
  even them do n't want to be with each-other ... :p, 
  what would be the capital ? 
  fight !, 
  was i the only teenager surrounded by somewhat sane people ? 
  i 'm not the one trying to tell others what they should do . 
  you ask for help but become hyper defensive every time someone try to answer you ... as we say in france , stop farting higher than your ass . 
  as long as you are not a citizen , you do n't have any right to stay in any country to start with . 
  are you an asian applauding ? 
  that convention only means that poland can not argue that it is not an official document . 
  but they can still decide what to do with it and investigate to see if it meets their criteria to grant you some rights . 
  they are not questioning the legal value of it , but it 's motive . 
  if they think you are only trying to work around a loophole , i do n't think they can break it , but they can refuse to let you in ( or ask you to leave ) . 
  this is strictly a national immigration policy unrelated to the question of fake documents . 
  i ca n't talk about poland specifically , but there where talks about immigration relative to fighting marriages of convenience . 
  they may want to check you did not just marry her to gain entry to the eu . 
  it is not about the first page result but about how google wants to auto-complete the query `` germany is '', 
  the real question is : is hungary hungry for turkey ? 
  it never really considered that i was n't . 
  but one thing particularly made me realized what the eu meant to me . 
  france does n't have any closed border any more ( at least on land ) . 
  we are completely surrounded by allies , including our past strongest enemies . 
  i consider the french border to be in eastern europe : ukraine is not some country at the other end of the continent but our neighbor . 
  depending on where you live , `` another country '' may as well simply be the couch . 
  perceived as not entirely healthy of mind , maybe . 
  called future murderers and traitors , i do n't think so . 
  allah akbar , god saves the queen , may his noodly appendage touch you , whatever ... 
   `` left to the exclusive appreciation of the jugendamt '' is more of a key point than `` imminent danger '' in my example , the cop also uses his own exclusive appreciation of the situation to determine if you are harming anyone . 
  only once you are behind bars ( ie . 
  not representing an imminent danger anymore ) will the judiciary be involved . 
  you can not dissociate one from the other . 
   the notion of `` imminent danger to the child '' , a legal prerequisite to this action , is left to the exclusive appreciation of the jugendamt . 
  hey , did you know that if a cop sees you committing a crime , they can arrest you without referring to a court first ? 
  such abuse of power !, 
  `` hey , some german official agency ask the police to enforce their legally binding decision , let 's complain to american media that it was an abduction . '', 
  what 's next ? 
  will the police arresting you be called an abduction too ? 
  as for targeting home-schoolers : in most civilized countries , the right of children to receive a proper education trumps the `` right '' of their parents to jeopardize their future . 
  if it was found that the kids where not properly taught , taking action against that is perfectly legitimate . 
  moving to france will not change that : i think we may be a bit more permissive on that topic , but not by much . 
  also , you say it 's [ nbc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nbc ) while it is in fact [ cbn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_broadcasting_network ) , a proselyte network . 
  i 'm not saying any institution should be exempt from scrutiny and is above the risk of abuse of power . 
  but you are putting a lot of effort into fear-mongering and pushing some sort of agenda . 
  `` putain ! '', 
  can also be used somewhat similarly to `` fuck ! '', 
   `` this is a sign that the strategic partnership between russia and france has great prospects . '', 
  the thing is that the word `` kid '' has a very loose meaning . 
  there are 4 taxi movies . 
  well , it mostly depends of what you like , and i have no ideas what is easily available with subtitles ... 
  there are a bunch of old comedies that are typically french staring [ louis de fun\u00e8s ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000086/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 ) , as well as the [ 7\u00e8me compagnie trilogie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&amp;q=+la+7%c3%a8me+compagnie&amp;s=all ) . 
  although i recon seeing the swiss guards fight might be fun , i doubt they would be of much use . 
  even worse : black kkk !, 
  let 's not make that a religious war on both sides ...
