  * & nbsp ; * pops from under my rock * what are you all talking about ? 
  you do n't want to split france and germany , it usualy does n't end well ... 
  france is nowhere near to leaving the eu . 
  most people will say that not all is perfect , but without agreeing on what should be changed . 
  the result may look like we want to get rid of all of it , while in fact we just like to complain about politics . 
  another kebab from anywhere else in europe ? 
  we should rule out `` greating '' stupid puns though ... 
  `` death to the jews '' would be `` mort aux juifs '' without `` la '' . 
  my point is that one could expect that kind of convoluted illegal transaction to involve drugs , laundering money , or at least shipping a huge supply . 
  fifty . 
  do you mean that an hydrophobic paint has an irrational fear of water ? 
  that title concentrates on the important stuff :  illegal exports in russia `` wow , more corruption ! '', 
  it 's a bit hard to read , but that 's unmistakably french !, 
  i wonder what english from that time looks like ... 
  no , the border he is referring to is between french guyana and mainland brazil . 
  here it is between two `` outside '' territories of eu countries . 
   a lot of american news outlets paint this picture that islam is taking over france and france will be a muslim country . 
  a lot of french people have this picture that political agendas are taking over american news outlets and american news outlets are full of shit . 
  to say that it does n't make a difference , we say `` kif-kif '' or `` kif-kif bourricot '' . 
  `` kif '' is arabic for `` same '' ( or so i 'm told ) and `` bourricot '' is slang for `` donkey '' . 
  when we are afraid , we have `` le trouillom\u00e8tre \u00e0 z\u00e9ro '' ( the fear-meter to zero ) or `` les foies '' ( the livers ) . 
  something very far away and remote is said to be in tataouine , a tunisian city that was the inspiration for tatooine . 
  someone lazy has a `` un poil dans la main '' ( a hair in the hand ) . 
  to do something that is both long and useless is `` peigner la girafe '' ( comb the giraffe ) or `` pisser dans un violon pour jouer une symphonie '' ( piss in a violin to play a symphony ) . 
  someone that does n't see something right in front of him has `` des peaux de saucisse devant les yeux '' ( sausage 's skins in front of his eyes ) . 
  if you do n't care about something , you say `` je m ` en fous comme de l'an quarante '' ( i give as much fuck about it as about the year 40 ) .

   all others , including soldiers , infantry , and even commandos are not allowed to carry loaded weapons . 
  because this is ridiculous , the government hides it . 
  this is well known . 
  in fact , the guns are loaded or not depending on the alert level . 
   is the weapon on safe , requiring them to take the weapon off safe before they fire ? 
  is the rifle set on auto fire or on semi-auto ? 
  do you really want automatic weapons with the safety off in the middle of a civilian crowd ?

  5 , 2015 update : the operation has been renamed vigipirate vigipirate exists since 1978 , and has been constantly activated on some level for years . 
  it was put on alert on the 7 ^ ( th ) of january and extended on the 5 ^ ( th ) of february . 
  & nbsp ; while vigipirate has a ** lot ** of issues , from the legitimacy of using the army as police to it 's effectiveness , this article contains some serious bullshit . 
  to put the painting itself in perspective : it is exposed in the * mus\u00e9e d'orsay * , a public museum in paris . 
  seeing what french points to , i assume you mean what is the traditional `` this is ... to me '' to say you do n't understand ? 
  if that 's the case , i 've never heard javanese used in that context , they may be a confusion with [ `` javanais '' slang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javanais ) . 
  i 'm not saying it is better , just pointing out that the current western form of government is not the only democratic one . 
  let 's take an example . 
  the pre-ww2 french government was a democratic republic . 
  that same government , elected by the majority , legally transitioned to the vichy regime after the german invasion and de gaulle technically committed high treason by fighting against the * collaboration * . 
  you do n't always have the possibility to know what the majority want , even by following the law . 
  you need to keep some leeway in the institutions . 
  my point is that it does n't really matter how as long as it is present . 
  the thing is that the teaching in question here is closer to sunday school if i understand correctly . 
  `` democratically elected governments '' is an indirect democracy . 
  preferring a direct form of democracy is not anti-democratic . 
  you do n't need a separate course for that , it is only a choice in the organisation of the curriculum . 
  in france it is ( was ? ), 
  a bit covered in history-geography ( as part of a culture ) and french ( as literature ) . 
  there is a difference between teaching religion and teaching about religions . 
  i never spoke about giving `` free reign '' to anybody . 
  coincidentally , simply stating that a tool will `` obviously '' not be abused is giving free reign to the ones that wield it . 
  on top of that , i 'm not an anarchist , but calling them authoritarian is a bit of a stretch ... 
  [ website of the list ] ( http://prebake.eu/ ) ( with single click activation ) . 
   there 's a huge difference between questioning politicians and questioning state authority . 
    one means the natural process of participating in the democratic process . 
  the other means trying to overthrow democratically elected governments to impose their personal brand of authoritarian regime . 
  if one thing should be remembered from ww2 , it is that a democratically elected government can not be blindly trusted . 
   police forces already use biometric information in their daily affairs , and have been doing so for over a century . 
  there is a difference between biometric identification of an individual and using `` genetic similarities '' for profiling . 
  i wonder if it 's possible to make some rules for adblock ... btw , `` eu cookie law '' sounds tasty !, 
  it is not a waranty of any sort but an average . 
  statisticaly , you should get a bell curve : some will break early , some will last ages , but most will die around when they were designed to . 
  you enjoy reddit a lot more when you see it as a zoo . 
  what do they mean by `` american '' ? 
  people that do n't care ? 
   4th reich nonono , it 's the * 3 ^ \u00e8me empire * . 
   in conflict since charles the great died . 
  for a second , i was confused . 
  in france , we know him mainly as `` charlemagne '' , while `` the tall/great charles '' is often use to refer to de gaulle . 
  we 're talking about asterix , not tintin ... 
  it 's azrael , the evil cat from the smurfs .

  i think it 's the biggest manga market outside of japan .

   uk - srsly ? 
  they removed the scottish blue ? 
  the difference is that one is still living memory .

  `` they ca n't be * that * stupid , right ? '', 
  well yes , * they * knew but * he * did n't .

  `` i 'm not part of the elite because i 'm part of an elite . '', 
  wot ? 
  `` children 's patriotic education at an arms fair '', 
  that 's such a cheesy thing to say !, 
  yep , and we 're not sharing !, 
  it is already partly owned by the state . 
  it 's not state aid to a private entity but securing the state 's own investment . 
  the state own a part because it 's a strategic component of france 's military . 
  unlike oversea * d\u00e9partements * which are integral parts of the french republic and the european union , french polynesia is semi-autonomous . 
  there is a huge difference between not making promises and actively hurting people .
