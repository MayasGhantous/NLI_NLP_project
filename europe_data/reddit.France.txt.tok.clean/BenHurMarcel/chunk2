  really ? 
  and on our side , we 're wondering how you can be hungry only 5 hours after lunch . 
  i guess you do n't eat much at dinner and are very hungry at breakfast maybe ? 
  that sounds like the inspiration they had when creating milton keynes . 
  the problem with tasers is that you tend to use it also in situations where you would n't have fired a gun . 
  it 's still a dangerous and very serious weapon , yet you can get a bit `` trigger happy '' with it since there are good chances it does n't kill the guy . 
  definitely not as `` notorious '' for that . 
  no , everywhere in france , it 's always about belgians . 
  what do you mean `` letting this on '' ? 
  it 's just unmanageable . 
  you ca n't hit them , or put them into a camp ( human rights , decency , and so on ) . 
  you ca n't arrest them more them a few hours then ( because you have nowhere to put them ) . 
  you ca n't send them anywhere else ( you ca n't prove where they come from ) . 
  the french had a `` processing center '' called sangate . 
  it has closed due to pressure from human right concerns , including british pressure ( who criticised the treatment of the refugees ) . 
  the only thing you can do is let them be around , and try to protect the roads . 
  when you protect an area they just go a little bit further . 
  you do n't want to push them too much away because that could end up a bit everywhere and you 'll have a regional problem instead of one city only . 
  local brands primarily target their own market usually . 
  they adapt the product and marketing to the local market . 
  it makes much more sense to buy a renault for a french than for a german . 
  it 's adapted to the market , there 's a large availability of parts and specialized mechanics , plus it 's easier to resell . 
  a large market share has inertia , it 's the `` safe '' choice , as long as they keep being decent . 
  also foreign cars are more expensive for some reason , the same german car is cheaper in germany than in france . 
   in france if you didnt do anything wrong prior to being arrested , aka being arrested for the first time , you wont have to face any consequences basicaly huh , you 're going to need a source for that . 
  that 's not law . 
   i have no clue how they het away with this fucking bullshit . 
  just like the taxis got away with violence on other drivers , and destroying infrastructure . 
  just like some bretons got away with destroying road infrastructure for lorry taxes . 
  i 'm sick of that shit too . 
  hopefully it does n't happen that often . 
   it is on an entirely different level than the states . 
  [ well that 's not true actually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita ) . 
  the us is at 1028 . 
  in france we have `` smokes like a fireman '' . 
  it goes back when there were no fireproof fabrics ; firemen used to get soaked in water before going into a fire . 
  they came back smoking vapor a lot . 
  knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit , wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad . 
  just preparing for bastille day . 
  well i do n't see where you read that . 
  here are some of the top comments . 
   i am totally for linguistic diversity , but i think he is a bit clumsy . 
  with a better implementation it would go just fine . 
   beautiful storm of shit [ linking to the / r/europe complaining thread ] . 
  especially the scottish guy who says he 's fighting against the `` french language domination '' while wanting to ban all languages besides english . 
   it 's been a long time since i 've left / r/europe . 
  xenophobia and racism everywhere and against everyone  it looks more and more to me like / r/europe and / r/european are converging . 
  mods try to prevent it , and they get insulted back in completely hyperbolic ways . 
   seeing the mess right now for such a minor thing , i imagine that the idea of decorating / r/europe for bastille day falls flat ? 
   i must say i laugh pretty well reading the comments . 
  especially those which speak about arrogance or nationalism . 
   when you look at the critics , that shitstorm is just a primary anti-french feeling . 
  the op starts on the idea that the megathread is n't a live update , and goes on with the idea that it 's because of / u/dclauzel because he writes in 2 languages ( very logical link there ) . 
  the conclusion is that all the french are smug and use french to better snob the other users . 
   they are so butthurt it becomes comical . 
   oh no , the mod got it wrong and wrote `` attentat '' in the title . 
  let 's burn him !, 
  there are only a couple comments blaming / u/dclauzel like you say . 
  [ that one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3baic7/je_dois_dire_que_jappr%c3%a9cie_grandement_la_temp%c3%aate/cskg3lw ) , and [ that one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3baic7/je_dois_dire_que_jappr%c3%a9cie_grandement_la_temp%c3%aate/cskg3lw ) mostly . 
  they 're not the top ones at all . 
  you 're kidding ? 
  [ it 's all the contrary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3baic7/je_dois_dire_que_jappr%c3%a9cie_grandement_la_temp%c3%aate/ ) . 
  pas d'accord . 
  some people always complained , but usually lots of other guys said they liked it . 
  honestly i do n't see the problem . 
  so edgy . 
  first , you guys need to stop throwing a fit for a lost accent on one word . 
  `` m\u00e9gathread '' is n't even french ( we do n't say `` thread '' ) . 
  then , it 's not because something is a `` megathread '' that it needs to be updated all the time with articles . 
  it 's not a news site , merely a unique discussion place . 
  it would have been better to have higher quality links to provide context , but that 's it . 
  no need to insult people and debate for days just because one thread was n't at the best it could have been . 
  maybe because it 's far from clear that a majority are annoyed . 
  a few vocal people are angry , lots do n't care , some support it . 
  you realise that the posters here are spending time insulting a person for posting one thread they do n't like on an internet forum ? 
  chill out ; jerk off or something . 
  i disagree . 
  where does that expectation of updates come from ? 
  it 's just a unique thread to post related comments , in a central place . 
  no need for updates , it 's not a news site . 
  he could have done it , but it 's nothing necessary nor compulsory . 
  are you seriously butthurt by a little facetious sentence choice ? 
  i found it amusing . 
  you should chill a bit really . 
  and reddit is pretty much it . 
  at the same time that defeats the whole point . 
  if you consider that non-english languages are to be used only for unimportant matters , it makes them hobbies , local curiosities at best . 
  linguists disagree . 
  languages shape the culture and way of thinking . 
  but seeing that you 're referring to a `` tower of babylon '' as something serious , i guess you 're not too much into that kind of reflexion . 
   i still do n't buy into the existence of us-state-run industrial espionage i 'm not so sure really . 
  they 've been on that edge several times . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/25907502 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32542140 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echelon  in the early 1990s , the u.s. national security agency intercepted the communications between the european aerospace company airbus and the saudi arabian national airline . 
  in 1994 , airbus lost a $ 6 billion contract with saudi arabia after the nsa , acting as a whistleblower , reported that airbus officials had been bribing saudi officials to secure the contract . 
  as a result , the american aerospace company mcdonnell douglas ( now part of boeing ) won the multi-billion dollar contract instead of airbus . 
   the american defense contractor raytheon won a us$ 1.3 billion contract with the government of brazil to monitor the amazon rainforest after the u.s. central intelligence agency ( cia ) , acting as a whistleblower , reported that raytheon 's french competitor thomson-alcatel had been paying bribes to get the contract . 
   in order to boost america 's position in trade negotiations with the then japanese trade minister ryutaro hashimoto , in 1995 the cia eavesdropped on the conversations between japanese bureaucrats and executives of car manufacturers toyota and nissan . 
  plus the reports of missing corporate laptops at border controls ... 
  i agree , but that 's not the point . 
  anyway , nothing allows to think that their competitors did n't use bribery either .
