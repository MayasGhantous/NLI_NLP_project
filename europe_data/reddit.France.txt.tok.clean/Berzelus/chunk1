read micro-bevel and though what the hell does a micro-bevel have to do with politics ... fun stuff . 
  my comment takes into account that there is no foul play and/or favoritism among the `` participants '' , i 'll agree , however the same can be said about the women already having high positions , that they got their positions to avoid having problems with parity etc etc. 
  or perhaps not !, 
   what you end up saying is that , there 's only meritocracy at play and the stats show that men are better than women at becoming ceo in sweden . 
  not better at becoming ceos , better at not being able to have kids , pursuing different goals merely because women get pregnant and not men . 
  i do n't mean to say women must stay at home to feed the kids , not at all , but some , perhaps many women prefer to focus on their family more than their career , ending up not becoming ceos . 
  it 's purely a `` lifestyle '' choice then , nothing to do about mental capacities , especially in positions where the only thing that matters is the brain and not , say , handiwork skills , or others where women may be less well equipped , for whichever reason ( i 'm not saying they exist necessarily , just that in the even they do , as women ** tend ** to be less inclined towards woodworking for example ) . 
   women might be descriminated against ** explicitly ** ( probably not the main raison ) or they might not aspire to be ceos ( then ask why ? 
  we should teach all children to aspire to great things ... ) what do you mean by explicitly ? 
  as for the part about them aspiring to be ceos , it may be , * partly * because of differentl lifestyle choices . 
  all that is of course implying there is no foul play working with full parity ( not necessarily requiring meritocracy , could be the opposite too ) . 
  in the event there is no parity then everything can be explained by saying that women are shoved out of the big positions because they are women and so on , which is not something very credible or happening often , at least in my opinion , which would tend not to be as well informed . 
  i 'd like to say however that to counter an opinion such as mine one should not go on the other side , on extremes as sweden is not erithrea , parity is something close to happening and not a myth promoted by the patriarchy or whatever . 
  meh , i prefer the bleu , had found a nice one in dijon once , it was softer and creamier . 
  and how is one supposed to know he is wrong then , if what he thinks he knows is supposed to be the truth ? 
  only by having someone tell him he is wrong or by studying the matter , as you say , which must be triggered by something , a somethign that did n't exist until you said i was wrong . 
  an authoritarian says you are wrong yelling ** ca n't hear you ca n't hear you do n't exist kthxbye ** . 
  i think one of the first things i did was to admit my misinformation . 
  many negative adjectives would fit me , but i do n't quite think `` huge ego '' would cut it . 
  it may perhaps not be your duty but since we are in a conversation where you hold the opinion that i am wrong i think the best way to illustrate your point is to explain to me why i 'm wrong . 
  just my two cents there . 
   try ` since the 10th century ' . 
  that 's where i 'm getting at , i did n't know that either . 
  you almost gave me a heart attack ... 
  i 'm nobody , but i suggest that instead of acting all pissy and angry you actually explain to me the differences , then the stereotypes and the third hand info may dispel . 
  you know , constructive discussion and all that jazz . 
  to me garoyian is an armenian name , it ends in ian-yian , therefore it ca n't be a cypriot one , even if the guy there lives for the past 100 years , same for baghdadi . 
  platini is french but his name is not , or perhaps it is in marseille or corsica . 
  i keep repeating what i know while you do n't explain why what i say is wrong , so kindly do . 
  op , the fact that sweden does n't have as many women as ceos might be not caused by lack of feminism and simply that they were not good enough . 
  meritocracy tends to put the best at a job and if for some reason the women happen not to be good enough , or available for such a position then it 's not a sexism issue . 
  well i 'd guess that the armenians and maronites would tend to not have a greek/cypriot sounding name , no ? 
  now , i had n't heard of alambra at all before , so now my question is answered , thabk you very much , but what the hell doed res-tag mean and why would it be warranted in this case ? 
  ah , now i see . 
  thanks !, 
  maybe you do n't meet other armenians very often then :p, 
  and all are either greek cypriots or/and turkish cypriots . 
  save for british cypriots but they do n't count . 
  therefore my question remains , as the surname alambritis does not have anything specifically cypriot , to my knowledge , compared to greek names . 
  in short , why did / u/digenisakritas say :  that name sounds cypriot as fuck . 
  does it have a word/part of word that makes it cypriot , and if so , which ? 
  ah , another american touting the social welfare state , as if people were n't able to make enough money to do the things they do without governmental intervention and subsidisation ... 
  today i learned that we still have a coal industry o.o, 
  may this be a joke/a failure from the start , i do think we should fight back as much as possible . 
  we do n't want to change from us overlords to un overlords , the point of the internet is to not have overlords , at least as much as possible . 
  varg vikernes , leave this body !, 
  why chypriot and not greek , if i may ask ? 
  i 'm not familiar with the name differences . 
  oh , well it depends on the country really , on your accent , your attitude , a lot of things . 
  i mean , i get cold treatment here and then too , depending on context , but generally people in france ( non paris or other big cities ) are mostly open and smiling , excluding ghetto sectors , and so are they in greece , albeit a bit more hearty and open . 
  but that 's because i speak in the local language , while it may not have been so if i spoke english or german or with an accent , in germany and czechia i recall people being a bit colder . 
  all the armenians i have met ( say , 10 or so ) , both in france and in greece were kinda gloomy and slightly isolated from the rest . 
  my uncle went in armenian a year or two ago and said that the people there were very very moody , with an exception being a guy being hyper optimistic as a reaction to the general populace . 
  i really ca n't understand it , why ? 
  always wanted to taste sauerkraut , instead i got the munich airport austrian salami . 
  not too bad i guess . 
  top kek, 
  of , i would n't know , i tend to not care too much about all those conspiracy claims , as they rarely have anything close to the truth . 
  but oh well , who am i to judge . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  a twat is being racist , wopty doo , not the first or last time . 
  let him be charged if the law can ( did n't read his comments but even if inflamatory they may not be illegal to say ) and be done with it . 
  how the hell you fit the debt problem in this is a mystery to me and i think rather silly . 
  from personal experience also , i have barely seen this `` malaise '' you talk about . 
  it 's much more prevalent in france than in greece , again from personal or second hand experience . 
  i-inception ? 
  or just circlejerk . 
  you imply that only anti immigration parties do it , which is nonsense . 
  the recording of the extent of the crisis is not unonteresting in my opinion . 
  it gives perspective on the whole thing , where there are some who struggle a lot , but are not migrants . 
  explain `` anti-immigration trolls '' , because i can as much claim that the sub has been co opted by immigrant-phile trolls too . 
  oh dear me , how incompetent ... 
  `` minister writes controversial tweets '' '' hey !, 
  no wondet greeks are so incompetent , ho ho ho ! '', 
  for reals ? 
  i only ever heard of the masons tbh , who are roughly related to the jews or whatever, 
  yes , calling those you do n't agree with crazy is the best thing to do , ad hominem is the best argument , sure thing bro, 
  or with bernard henry levi, 
  to be fair the western countries has had the colonies , so there is diversity on that side , along with slavery, 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  you ca n't impose `` harsh measures '' which violate a whole bunch of laws and treaties . 
  you can bring the problem forward to change those laws or to reach a settlement but doing what you say is nonsensical . 
  i see . 
  from seeing as many south africans on a local industry meeting i 'd have thought they went over these problems . 
  what do you mean by `` go find a unicorn '' ? 
  and what harsh measures if i may ask ? 
  based on your previous comments i expect somethings either illegal or unrelisable , so do pardon me for not seeing your `` resolution '' in a good eye . 
  damn , i though this had stopped back in the 90 's, 
  i see . 
  has n't the situation gone better in the past 2-3 years though ? 
  biggest player in which sector though ? 
  i can see south africa in a much better position , may it be economic , military or industrial . 
  or like the missions in africa france and other countries have engaged in . 
  i do n't have news from central africa but it was n't going too badly and the mali conflict was effectively stopped . 
  a coalition/eu/un force could to the job , they just need to send ground troops , that 's the harder part tough . 
  nope , but would n't be against ground intervention in libya , under the un , as a peacekeeping operation . 
  or peacegiving ... 
  and they 'd undoubtedly breach the libyan border to prevent you from disembarking them . 
  it would cause a huge diplomatic incident and greece wants one thing : to be left alone to recover , not become the most publicized thing since the finding of the potato . 
  sending them there would be equal to murder .
