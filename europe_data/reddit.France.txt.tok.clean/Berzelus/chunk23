  as calling fyrom macedonia is not an illegal act . 
  nor is the opposite , it 's just that currently it is not recognised as such . 
  on the other hand i dunno how the rest of the interview went , maybe the crew was being abrasive repeatedly before that , with leading questions and whatnot , so one could excuse such a mishap . 
  no notre dame de reims and no agia sofia , heresy !, 
  with extra chantilly hur hur . 
  so childish , tssk tssk, 
  herm ... what about french cock , hmmm ? 
  i meant the rooster of course !, 
  thanks !, 
  fun fact , picard is the name of the inhabitants of the french region of picardie . 
  also a supermarket ( i think , never entered ) . 
  yep . 
  it 's still not sure though and a friend offered me to work on another castle , which is mostly a ruin and needs repairing . 
  quite a weird situation because that castle is actually owned by one of his friends/professors ( sorbonne ) and may be turned in the long run in a museum or whatever . 
  super cool stuff anyway . 
  do n't think origins , more like the celts founding a colony . 
  look up the wounded/dying gaul , a statue that refers to the period during which they fought against the ancient greeks . 
  do n't recall much myself tho . 
  i start realising that if we knew our history better and where our roots were we could manage to reduce the extremist nationalist elements - which i think stem from the 19th century - that are often a problem in the eu . 
  for example , slavs are not barbarian invaders from mongolia after all and in reality may have had extended contacts with celts and germanics . 
  a few drawings i saw on wikipedia showed a slavic shaman `` blessing '' sole warriors , an image that was reminiscent of the gauls . 
  interesting read so far , thanks !, 
  all-right . 
  got any more info about the slavs prior to the greeks and romans ? 
  geographical distribution etc etc ? 
  nice video , thanks . 
  and also in greece . 
  you 're right , sorry for that . 
  hiwever why should only western europe be concerned ? 
  central and eastern europe are in the eu and thus have their language recognised as an official eu one . 
  i agree , but my point is that on one side you have an absolute shithole , somalia , afghanistan and co , then you have egypt and others and then you have morocco , algeria and so on . 
  sure , they are not like switzerland , but considering the baggage they are not too bad . 
  so far i heard rumors of the sisi administration perpetrating some crimes . 
  nothing of the sort for morocco . 
  i do n't think it 's comparable . 
  well if we go by that it means we apply a specific standard on who 's a migrant and no , regarding the time that has passed with them being sedentary . 
  who puts in place that standard ? 
  how long ? 
  is it 300 years ? 
  in the end we are all migrants , almost . 
  in my opinion we can only judge by our own times ' standards , thus define migrants those who came here in our lifetime + / - our parents/grandparents and children/grandchildren . 
  turkish-cypriots are not a migrant communit . 
  nor are the turks in bulgaria , bosnia and greece . 
  my apologies , i meant specificaly :  greece is well documented at being close to useless when it comes to processing asylum claims . 
  would love to see you well documented source, 
  yes dr. gumby . 
  fuck man i must be under drugs or something because the more i speak to you the less it makes sense . 
  how did we get from from turkish/cypriot relations to tectonic plates again ? 
  or is another distraction tactic ? 
  what 's the point of writing it like that ? 
  what 's 2k2 ^ 4 supposed to mean ? 
  careful with the libyan terrorists !, 
  yeah , the headline did n't mention it but the mod flaired it `` since december '' or something . 
  did n't read the article though . 
  i was quoting the gumby doctor sketch from the monty pythons , what about you ? 
  also , i think what / u/alucardxx said is incorrect , the were considered valid up until december , but not anymore . 
  i apologize for the low effort i 'll be putting in this response but i 'm very tired . 
   it always takes two to tango . 
  yet one party being in the eu and the other not , there is invariably going to be a bias in favor of the eu member . 
  that is the problem . 
  to get to the truth , we need to correct that bias ... cyprus is currently partly under occupation from turkey . 
  this is an unresolved case . 
  greece acted against cyprus a while ago but not anymore . 
  greece has and may still be at fault but turkey is ** still ** the offender . 
  reconciliation ? 
  why not . 
  but not with cyprus divided . 
  and that is not in greece 's hand , the ball is in the turkish field . 
  do you think it 's unfair for a country occupied by another to be able to veto the latter 's accession to the eu ? 
   so far the price has been paid by the final destinations : sweden , germany , austria , etc. 
  direct costs to the public coffers in germany are about 20k/year per asylum seeker . 
  greece does not have any welfare system to house , feed , etc. 
  refugees . 
  before tsipras there were many camps housing refugees , therefore your statement is incorrect . 
  do sweden and germany pay more ? 
  oh absolutely . 
  but greece is n't idle either . 
  additionally in the past many refugees have been housed at the state 's expense . 
   greek agriculture would n't be able to survive without cheap illegal immigrant labor . 
  the labour is cheaper than the machines but in absolutely no way would the sector not be able to survive , especially with all the subsidies in the past . 
  **  and the number of registered asylum seekers in greece is ridiculously small . 
  thus , the migrants probably benefit the greek economy more than it costs its public coffers . 
  ** registered ** being the keyword . 
  the unregistered were told to number in the million in the past , pre-crisis . 
  people that work in the black market earn less . 
  if they earn less globally the work is going to be globally less paid . 
  thus the natives , which are used to a higher paygrade , will not do the job . 
  if the number of migrants ( at first albanians ) was not that high more people would have probably worked in the constructions sector . 
  all in all , does the greek government benefit from this ? 
  perhaps , but i doubt it because these people get paid for a job without any money going to the state , while the state will pay unemployment benefits to greek citizens . 
  that 's also another factor . 
   turkey did not receive any money whatsoever . 
  what was that talk about some 2-3 billions for helping the turkish state then ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious , not trying to be condescending/sarcastic . 
   greece has already received hundreds of millions to do ordinary border controls , like finger printing , every country is expected to do even without foreign subsidies . 
  i 'll need a source on that because the funds i remember were about 150 millions to be given from 2016 through 2020 . 
  4 years , assuming equal distribution would make the figure around 33 millions per year . 
   you are contradicting yourself . 
  migrants will want to go to sweden , germany , the uk , etc. , no matter what these countries do . 
  i do n't see a contradiction , germany , sweden and co provide huge benefits to migrants , at times higher than locals in entry level jobs .
