  by extensions , * there 's nothing new under the sun * . 
   if you dont think that this kind of behaviour isnt fueling the oil for nationalisam and hate by the greek state ... idk what to say i never said it did n't , i literally said his actions are reprehensible and that he likely , or should have been demoted/investigated . 
  i actually agreed with you . 
   this was mostly a jest ;d , just to show that this kind of nonsensical behaviour can work either way . 
  realisticly sicily could call itself hellas whith this kind of argumentation greeks use today . 
  fun fact , in sicilly or another place in italy , a village claimed to be mostly of greek ancestry , having a small festival ? 
  or feast , whatever . 
   fact is that this republic was called socialist republic of macedonia for last 60 + years and noone said anything , and now its problem . 
  its like , idk , germany saying france cant be called france because germans consider themselves sole inheritors of old franks . 
  a bit stupid analogy , i know , but cant remember better ... that would be stupid . 
  point is that after so long time no neighbouring country can insist that you have to change the name of your country . 
  i am not from macedonia btw . 
  the problems is that before the war the greek government could n't do anything , or tito may have been annoyed and switched positions ( if other actions followed too ) which would have put greece in much shittier position . 
  after the war they did have talks but tito mostly ignored them and they stopped , otherwise it would have been a waste of time . 
  my whole point is not that the country must not be called macedonia , but that it ca n't be called * only * macedonia , because that 's the whole apple of eris situation . 
  cutting the apple in two does not satisfy one side or the other entirely , but both are somewhat satisfied and none is wronged . 
  it seems to me it ends in a simple conflict of beliefs , therefore i can only answer to you as such : i do n't agree with you \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  perhaps , but if you do n't do it , then the other gets to be named potatoland and then you 're fucked for ever . 
  either way you 're fucked , so why not try to make it as painless as possible ? 
  the name of the region a * part * of fyrom own . 
  fyrom is not the entirety of macedonia , if it was there would have never been any issue whatsoever . 
  if they claim to be the people of macedonia , and call so the country , then by extension those outside of the country are not macedonians . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:macedonia_overview.svg this map highlights the unfairness of such a situation , as both in historic and in current geographic terms the regions is shared between both . 
  in france the people in the champagne region are called champenois . 
  these people have the right to the name because of the region but in no case as a name of ethnicity . 
  if the people of fyrom want to be called macedonians ( which in the first place is an invention of tito ) , they can be as a region , but in no way as a nation . 
  greece does n't oppose the macedonia being in the name ( the far right does ) but they oppose it being the only `` term '' of the name . 
  northern macedonia is not derisive , it 's not inaccurate and does n't rub anybody the wrong way , or if so i do n't know of them or why . 
  and i can not understand why , especially concerning it is a compromise for both . 
  greece does n't tell them what they can be called , they tell them what they * ca n't * called , not for some reason that dropped out of the sky , but for the reason that otherwise it argues the existence of the region macedonia as a being part of greece , partly . 
  i 'm all about having a compromise , but saying `` x is my name , deal with it '' is not a compromise . 
  why should they have to compromise you 'll ask ? 
  because that name is not their 's to take , it ** already ** belongs somewhere else , to the * region * macedonia . 
  and they can share it . 
  that 's the compromise . 
   however , just telling another country what it can or can not name itself , and throwing international tantrums when third parties recognize a country 's name , looks less like the behavior of a civilized country and more like something russia does when declaring foreign territory its own . 
  if your you are not being respected , what is left to do ? 
  peaceful negotiation , that 's what . 
  both parties may have their right , therefore both should be satisfied as much as possible , instead of saying fuck him and get everything . 
  because compromising is more civilized than turning a deaf ear . 
  i think i know my politics better than you think i do . 
  i know about those wars but they have nothing to do with the present issue . 
  additionally they are more closely tied to ethnic/cultural/religious differences than a mere naming difference . 
   as you say its an issue they want resolved ; you do n't resolve it by not accepting macedonian passports , or blackening their name during a basketball game , but by talk and compromise . 
  i couldnt find a fucking road sign for skopje when driving from thesalloniki ( an ottoman founded city btw ) . 
  that is not politics and diplomacy , it is children in courtyard fighting , and the bully molesting the small one for his perverse enjoyment . 
  denying passports does not happen often and is reprehensible for the person doing it . 
  the blanking of the name was done domestically and did not , absolutely not affect the people of fyrom . 
  i would say that the fans affected the greek people more than the blank space , since the blank space was targeted at the greeks while the fans targeted the greeks too . 
   ** thesalloniki ( an ottoman founded city btw ) ** now this for example is historical revisionism , thessaloniki was founded a bit after the death of alexander the great and through the byzantine empire was also called \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 if i got it right , which means co-reigning , as in being the second largest/most important city after constantinople . 
  as for the signs , what else can they do apart from writing fyrom ( writing skopje is silly , but that 's the governor 's fault , not the government ) . 
  as for your bully analogy , remember the bully used to be tito to which the greek government could n't say not . 
  so i guess that what 's done in a half assed way comes around . 
   it is an issue that western europe doesnt hear about , but to someone who follows balkan politics , it is something that pops up every few days . 
  ( macedonia cant get into nato because of greece although the fulfill all the requirements , etc. ), 
  they had 50 years to resolve it and they just remembered when yugoslavia collapsed , yeah ... really important question it must be ... few days is a bit much , i would say every few months , at the very least every several weeks . 
  also , macedonia does n't fulfill all the requirements , as solving this issue is a requirement . 
  they did n't just remember , they had put this problem since the end of the war , tito was just not listening . 
  why would he , he was more powerful . 
  greece a bully ? 
  perhaps , but not the first one . 
   one could point out that todays greeks ( hellas ) have nothing in common with greeks from 2000 years ago , as cullturaly they dont , after being romanised and ottomanised for 1500 years , just as todays slavic macedonians have nothing to do with alexanders and phillips macedonia . 
  if macedonia had bigger army than greece they could demand that greece doesnt use its name on the same grounds and logic as greece is using right now . 
  they have in common several things , for example the language which is directly descendant of the ancient greek . 
  there 's also parts of the culture , certain beliefs also were retained . 
  the greek were as much romanized as much as the romans were hellenized . 
  both took in things . 
  and same goes for your `` ottomanisation '' . 
  fully ottomanised people exist in turkey , those who were n't are in greece . 
  that is not because they randomly sprouted out of somewhere , it is because a lot of the culture and beliefs managed to survive ( some did n't even get repressed at all , depending on the place ) . 
  as for the name greece , fyrom ca n't do anything about it because the mere name greek was used for the people through the history . 
  not just since one random guy started saying it , not because of a couple of villages that came and went . 
  they were called greeks , as far as i know since the roman times . 
  and if you actually manage it , they will just pick hellenes , which would n't be as advantageous . 
  the point that i 'm trying to make is that the name macedonians today defines the inhabitants of a region , not a country . 
  if a country wants to take that name they are usurping it on very weak historical claims that do n't go farther than 100 years , robbing the other half 's identity . 
  if they want to get over this shitty issue there must be a compromise , as you said i believe , and calling it macedonia or republic of macedonia is not a compromise . 
  let me ask you something . 
  does northern macedonia/northern republic of macedonia/republic of northern macedonia satisfy you ? 
  either of the three , i do n't care . 
  if not , tell me , are you not in the northern part of the region ? 
  if so , why not take the name ? 
  do you want only macedonia or republic of macedonia ? 
  does that mean that thessaloniki is not part of southern macedonia ? 
  does that mean that the people there are not southern macedonians and that as whole they are not macedonians ( people residing in the geographical region of macedonia ) . 
  because as far as i know thessaloniki is not the capital of a country called macedonia , therefore they do n't bother you by stealing your name . 
  they are called macedonia internally in the administrative regional level , which you can also do too , by calling the souther regions of fyrom as macedonia !, 
  the way i see it it 's a win-win, 
  so you think that greece should name itself usa if it wanted ? 
  or allegheny perhaps ? 
  just because some were lax in their choices does n't mean others must be too . 
  especially since the whole naming dispute originates from a dictator wanting to instill a national identity to his people that did n't quite fit . 
  when did it happen if i may ask ? 
  because there are wars that started for less in europe . 
  that is the far right , if we take for granted everything the far right says then we are in a tight spot . 
  well i guess they are counting the days , do n't you think ? 
  the context here though is different , it 's the forceful separation of the same country , the same people . 
  the region of macedonia does n't share the same people and never did it share the same country , unless if we go back in time very far , which would be irrelevant . 
  which is not a fact that warrants the inaction of others in a similar situation . 
  also , ** could ** anybody refuse what castille impose ?
