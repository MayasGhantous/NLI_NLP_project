  may be wrong of course . 
  oh all-right , gotcha . 
  and if the liberal/secular is more of a twat than the religious one , what happens then ? 
  is n't it just another form of discrimination , which assumes a secular person is better for x reason than a religious one , even if said religious person is very tolerant ? 
  well yes , that 's what is implied . 
  well then i 'd think it 's the other way around , southern states are cooperating too well , causing the migrants to flow fast and true to their goal , germany . 
  `` fail to cooperate '' the greek state was told to proceed by `` cataloguing '' the migrants but not hinder them , so i do n't think cooperation is the problem , more like the whole policy is a joke . 
  well yeah , they can be justin bieber themselves . 
  how dreadful would ** that ** be !, 
  do you imply something by saying `` unlike pragmatism '' ? 
  also thanks for the correction . 
  millennia of waging wars , senseless slaughter and justin bieber did n't change much , girls were always more or less hard . 
  i think the ira during a time was not something stupid and had legitimacy similar to the liberation attempts in the 19th century . 
  i see . 
  imo a couple of pictures , with simple symbolism was to be ok but now it became `` yeah be can be joining of france-love wagon '' while the day before they 'd spew the silliest surrender monkey jokes . 
  rather hypocritical and uninventive imo . 
  edit : fixed the spelling , or so i hope , of uninventive . 
  well , what `` bothers '' me a bit is that i do n't often see anything positive , which is what we lack the most of as europeans , but hey , the '' '' ( ears ? ), 
  are there to imply i did n't have much grief over it . 
  sincerely , froggy . 
  nope , is it as terrible as imgur with all the `` pray for paris '' posts ? 
  maybe , i have no idea and no way to prove otherwise or so . 
  guess schwarzenegger is our time 's loki then , minus the horse parts . 
  thanks !, 
  somebody downvoted you for some weird reason . 
  well frankly , perhaps the us too , since they have made many strikes but the results are not the best , so they may be inflating their numbers there . 
  perhaps but i feel that the ratio is more than 2:1 of said posts . 
  true it 's a figure of speech , however one that has often been used extensively to further dogma and frankly , often the only thing that dogma relies on . 
  i 'm not saying it is dogma or same as it . 
  i say that as hyperbole is oftne used to further dogma , usually by putting things out of context or making a situation ridiculous which turns the discussion/speech more into a show and less of a presentation of ideas/arguments . 
  i also believe that when used in a serious context as a counter argument , as above us , it 's a way to avoid the original argument or divert the discussion without answering truly . 
  not always of course , but in the present case i think it does as it changes the context and demands something which is contrary to the core of islam and not the actual problem . 
  the problem is not that homosexuals are not allowed in mecca , the problem is daesh and their ways onto people , including in this the way they and the wider islamic society is actively ** opposed ** to homosexuals having a life of equal worth to the rest of the population . 
  if we are to ask from the vatican to hold a gay pride then we may as well tell them to start adding graffiti on the church walls or on the robes , change the symbol every two days and every month to have an orgy . 
  guess that 's a hyperbole too , which i 'm using to counter your argument , which i originally said tends to mean i do n't have an actual rebuttal . 
  rules do n't apply to me !, 
  speaking of the orgy previously , it 's not something i would oppose !, 
  well i disagree , most populists use many types of speech but hyperbole is in the list . 
  example against gay people , they are like puzzle pieces , ca n't put it together unless if male + female . 
  thatns dogmatism and a silly argument . 
  well when it 's french bashing `` news '' articles it 's often coming from britain and less from the us , so there could be something similar going on . 
  hyperboles are not very far from dogma , more or less the opposite of what seccularism is . 
  ah , had n't heard of him . 
  story time !, 
  well being the catalyst for the ragnarok is n't making him very good , he does fuck shit up . 
  there are oaks in europe too tho :p, 
  at leat loki had the virtue of being a trickster . 
  the comments in the instagram link you posted are ... quite silly , to put it simply . 
  well if it 's bombing is targets only i do n't think anybody would have said anything at any point in time in the past two three years . 
  i meant on this subreddit . 
  i doubt the hezbollah has many redditors in here though ... 
  do n't disagree with him , however i 'm mostly focusing on syria , and northern syria more specifically , where kurds have a strong presence . 
  however the kurds have strong civilian support so there 's this difference , much less collaboration . 
  well i did n't deny that , did i ? 
  the taliban numbers are inflated enormously by locals being `` bribed '' to take arms and almost shoot in the air to mobilise the allied forces , then they go in the afghan army and then defect back . 
  https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucrckcyivjnazoelvubb89ka has many videos about the swedish , norwegian , danish and finnish expeditions which show this phenomenon , how the pashtun are made to be a fringe group by the central afghan government . 
  oh i do n't disagree that there will be ** some ** support , but i doubt it 'd be comparable to the overwhelming support in afghanistan from the pashtun people . 
  without trying to sound cheeky or anything , and if you want , you could watch these videos from the swedish , norwegian , finnish and danish soldiers . 
  it does explain a bit about the pashtun and how they operate with he taliban . 
  not in the same way as in afghanistan , there the locals that are against the taliban mostly do n't care and are ineffective , while in syria you have the various groups and the kurds who hate isil more than anybody else and they are mostly in their grounds . 
  the taliban were supported by locals and the state was n't keen on acting , while in syria the kurds and other would love . 
  to have a chance at vengeance . 
  any idea if she made it out alive ? 
  i think she was saying that she was pregnant , so that fall may have been fatal for her child , and could n't be good for her either . 
  same with a northern france lady . 
  welp , if you exclude the ghettos where i 've been i have never seen such behaviour but a couple of times . 
  usually it 's your manners that are reflected to you , so from my experience i 'd say that either they had a bad day or you were n't very nice/warm to them in the first place , because i 've noticed that if you greet people and are `` open '' you are treated very well . 
  but hey , anecdotal evidence and whatnot . 
  frankly i only heard that word in switzerland and on the news where parisians were talking , so as a `` fringian '' it seems odd . 
  do you , by any chance , live in paris or a big city ? 
  jeez another of these cunts ... 
  his surname sounds more like greek . 
  the worst is that people start using it in discussions , while speaking french . 
  all hail hypnotoad !, 
  how can you think gassing the jews would be cool ? 
  i mean , it must 've been pretty hot in there . . ^ ^ you ^ ^ saw ^ ^ nothing, 
  nice, 
  if we go as far back then we can also mention the deposed british king and cromwell ... 
  this could work nicelly as a gorrilla warefare copy pasta alternative , for sexual orientations . 
  another redditor said he does not drink alcoholic drinks . 
  well to be fair , it 's half , only 3,05 trillion times :p, 
  yes but as the document shared above states , these guys went to the gestapo by themselves , they were n't forced by anybody ( they were afraid , but not caught yet ) , so it adds up to the offense as it is utter profiteering . 
  i 'm sorry but i have trouble understanding to which events you refer to . 
  have there been pogroms in france lately ? 
  if you count in the charlie hebdo ( edit : and the other terrorist attacks of the past 2-3 years ) , then yes , you are right , but then i 'd argue that they were special cases , terrorism and not widespread . 
   edit : getting downvoted for being sorry the jews of greece were n't saved . 
  is this turning into r/european ? 
  maybe because people saw the thread of comments replying to you and did not agree with the following ideas expressed ? 
  if i 'm getting this right , the main perpetrator of the deportation of jews in thessaloniki were jews themselves ? 
  why though ? 
  how could only money be a valid `` excuse '' for doing this ? 
  if i had a buck for every french surrender monkey or greek poor pay debt jokes i 'd be able to fund the us military expenses for the next decades . 
  i do n't approve much of his policies in general either but i do n't think it 's a good thing to have a president voice support for a community that has been primarily been accused of having being given too much support in the past . 
  it would be like throwing oil in the fire for no reason . 
  the law is the law and it already has some bias in favor of jewish and other communities , it must be applied to the letter but i do n't think politicians should engage in favoritism . 
  all-right . 
  no need to apologise , everybody has lapses here and then . 
  i have heard very little from both ahmadinejad and rouhani , but one was never agreeign to any concession and the other did so . 
  one is the same as greek communists , saying no and fuck you at every turn and the other is like a greek cleric , very conservative and supportive of the church . 
  i 'd still prefer the cleric , because overall he has more chances to be an ally and more or less sensible , if that 's possible for iranian revolutionaries .
