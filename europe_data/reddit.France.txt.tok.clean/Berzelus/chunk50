  leading questions , along with a mocking tone are not often seen well by the people adressed . 
  you might want to keep that in mind before playing the victim . 
  most likely not , the person i 'm referencing was french ( who massacred french civilians ) , from either alsace or lorraine and if i recall well , he died in the 70 's of a natural death . 
  edit : well , ironically , joachim peiper died in the 70 's , in france , very near to both alsace and lorraine , though from his wikipedia page he was not present in france during the [ massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradour-sur-glane_massacre ) ( if , again , it is the one i remember ), 
  well , til , though i have in mind a video of jean-marie in the 50 's giving a speech in the assembl\u00e9 , which i doubt would 've been possible without a party . 
  calm your tits , this is not the guardian calling every trump supporter or pepe propagator a nazi or kkk sympathiser . 
  the fn has had support from neo-nazis since the 50 's . 
  hell , they were n't neo-nazis , some might 've been full blown nazis that got pardonned in one way or another , such as for example the commander of an ss division that massacred civilians , yet was free until his death . 
  there is the right , which some twats in the guardian and other publications like to call extremists , racists and so on and there are actual extremists which have openly associated themselves with nazi groups . 
  yes but just like paul , it 's a jewish name . 
  paul is the hellenisation of saul . 
  maybe he 's like marvin from the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy , `` i 've got something to say but none of you care '' type of person, 
  tht 's what you think !, 
  jesus is a greek name ? 
  i 'd disagree , but then you say  both sides are responsible which is what i was also going for . 
  corruption started with something . 
  or perhaps it would force the industry into implementing changes in the way business is made . 
  making it justified then , right ? 
  the tax policy is also death for business , from small to big . 
  plus ignoring that president who used to be a general , he was n't very influential / s, 
  which is what some do , get cheap ryanair flights , come to prove you werr sewrching for a job or for appointments and collect checks , then go back to morocco or algeria . 
  catalonia in a weaker positon than gibraltar , with that enormous industrial and tourist sector ? 
  does n't sound right . 
  dang , i shall have to make a round of triumph now , ** clop clop clop **, 
  yes , i snatched it from the paws of a very threatening predator !, 
  let 's just say that i enjoy going to the same island for the past 15 years and that i 've got to know a couple of places like the palm of my hand , and the entire island pretty well , hence having explored it a lot . 
  i mean , i have a tommy helmet , how cool is that ? 
  i really wanted to be mean and belittle for your comment because that is my current mood , so i will redirect you to my flair , to give you an idea on why that is . 
  i 've found about 300 bullets , casings and intact cartridges myself in greece . 
  99 % .303 british and some shotgun or lebel cartridges . 
  that is not an argument . 
  additionally , from a radio interview of one of the representatives of the farmers and co , the wolves have been in steady increase , despite the 20 % hunting cap that 's in place and they suggest that the numbers are more along the 4 thousands . 
  while i do not agree with citron 's argmentation , it must be taken into account that there are differences between estonia and france , namely the geography and terrain of the places affected , which may cause such sokutions to become much more difficult to pay for . 
  additionally , small businesses in the meat industry have been struggling a lot in the past 15 years , possibly due to the very strong supermarket franchises . 
  from what i 'm told , the `` hangover '' can be pretty bad , you 're in a very bad mood , a bit dissoriented and you may have halucinations . 
  we could have gotten so many nice spanish songs , but no , we have to have a cringe inducing turd . 
  it 's also that many puns and jokes do n't really translate that well or references that are not relevant to other countries . 
  said by a german . 
  ca n't get shut down harder by anybody on this topic !, 
  you mean the metal cartridge , the bullet is the projectile . 
  afaik , the first modern metal cartridge was the 1880 's lebel cartridge , all others were made of paper or not entirely metal , makibg them vulnerable to the elements . 
  to bw fair though , that 's how negotiations go some times . 
  we have those in thessaloniki too to be fair . 
  hmmm , that 's something i 'd expect from the actual robespierre to say about abolishing the capital punishment . 
  you need to write your arguments much better if you even want people to remotely think you 're not being edgy/an idiot . 
  muslim lands ? 
  do you forget that three of the five most important sites of the christian faith are in the middle east and north africa , alexandria , jerusalem and afaik antioch . 
  those parts where christian for centuries before being tied to islam . 
  hell , there are theories that muhammad was actually a christian at first because it was the religion of the place , or at least the dominating on in the general region . 
  that or just god bless ? 
  maybe , but your comment made me think , why not be the initials of kyrie eleison ? 
  it would fit with the phrase . 
  tastes more like beef liver , rather than its meat . 
  tastes better imo . 
  maybe `` and help stroimir '' ? 
  though it should 've been kai then . 
  what if i need to top off or modify my batteries ? 
  what if i run a small time electroplating shop , or only for personal use ? 
  could 've been brittano-franco-german , but that did n't really work out . 
  did so too , only to find potholes big as a wheel littering the roads . 
  roads that have a speed limit of 120-130 ... 
  especially considering that liquid is fused zinc ... 
  oh i 'd fit right in then !, 
  as long as they do n't push too hard , 
  trainee machinist , though i have a higher degree , in heat treatment , forging , casting and stamping tech , as they 'd call it anyway . 
  i 'm supposed to evolve in a quality control and basic r&d . 
  right off the bat i would have said `` enforce continued support '' , but because of some technical issues , that may be problematic on the company 's side , thus maybe to have a rule where a company , in this case logitech , to state how long they are going to be supporting a specific product with software upgrades . 
  that 's an idea , i 'm no lawmaker nor do i know the reality of the software business , my field is the heavy industry and manufacturing . 
  none , that 's what i 'm saying , this is still too early because the situation is not yet resolved . 
  speaking about this issue , i have another example . 
  my headset , the logitech g35 came out quite a bit of time ago . 
  the logitech software that allows the onboard audio card to work in 7.1 surround was updated some time between 2015 and today ( currently trying to narrow it down ) , rendering the surround option on this and possibly other older headsets to not have said option available . 
  this can very well be an error , some bit of code that was removed inadvertently , but it 's been three months now with the latest update coming 10 days ago with no solution . 
  assuming this was not a mistake , which i can not possibly know and affirm , would it not be a form of planned obsolescence ? 
  nothing changed with the hardware and installing a previous version makes the surround sound work . 
  i 'm not asking this to go and be `` ha , now get back at me !, 
  '' , i 'm asking this to understand your point of view better . 
  well , i 'm sorry to react just like you did then but what you saw it as and what it ** might be ** are two different things . 
  that 's another thing entirely though , init ? 
  that 's a fair point , but you do n't always initially know it 's a crappy product , then you 're screwed . 
  which gives birth , from what it seems , to this initiative by the european parliament . 
  we 've come full circle it seems ... 
  i am not asking for that . 
  the dremel example can happen in other , more expensive devices of the same type , essentially die grinders , but said issue can be ibexistent because of the adding of epoxy in a die grinder that 's half the price or less than the other ones . 
  i also never said what you said i did . 
  huh , i remember thinking how is this bridge above like , when i drove below a month or so ago . 
  did n't even have to look it up !, 
  how is this a conspiracy ? 
  i am not arguing about the lifetime of a product being limited by technical characteristics is bad , as for example a screw in a plane that fails after 200 thousand cycles , or that a car was designed with a specific amout of galvanisation done to the chassis in relation to the additional cost of material , efficiency and also how often cars usually take to be then scrapped . 
  i 'm arguing that ** certain ** choices are detrimental to the product 's life time for no gain . 
  what about coil wires that are left dangling on the back of small electric generators in stuff like dremels ? 
  they often break off due to fatigue , which could be avoided with epoxy or some other solution . 
  recoiling the entire spindle is not possible for the price of a dremel , making it night impossible to repair it . 
  if you have an argument to present , an article or something , that would be much more constructive than calling me a conspiracy theorist , because i may as well go the same way and call you a shill just for lack if evidence/arguments . 
  which i wo n't because i know it 's no way to have a discourse . 
  the argument is that it is not a microcontroller , in certain cases ( of course not always ) , but that at times there is a chip that does n't perform any function apart from acting like a piece of the circuit . 
  if it fries , thr circuit is cut . 
  the board does n't need that chip otherwise because the board already has lines that act as a circuit and these chips were installed there as a way to render the device useless . 
  that is what that report on tv said anyway . 
  if you have access to it , arte may still have a documentary on planned obsolecense in it 's website .
