  not really up to date , but was n't abedi or whatever born in the uk ? 
  no intervention had taken place at the time . 
  probavly not . 
  what i think he means is people that are '' \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 '' , free professionals , of which the examples you 've given are part of , however almost every boss , small time to big time boss is a free professional . 
  car garage owner ? 
  check . 
  restaurant owner ? 
  check . 
  boss of a small contracting firm that does feasibility reports and whatnot ? 
  check . 
  i 'm also pretty sure plumbers will be needed for quite a long time longer , such us private practise docs . 
  soldiers were present before we had the state of emergency , so it 's not related . 
  it worked well in mali , ask them , they requested help . 
  and the policy has changed . 
  perhaps , but we 're talking about current actions , not past ones . 
  yeah , stabilising the region = colonialism ... 
  same here, 
  well , as you 'd get from my comment , i mentioned europeans/brits and then the economy . 
  i did mention the people first and foremost , then the economy ... 
  i would also not have you do anything , you are your own bosses , vote for theresa victoria may if you wish , its not our decision . 
  pretty sure that 'll be more inconvenient for a big amount of europeans/britts and for the british economy , rather than for the immigrants, 
  i might be daft , but gow can you produce exit polls two days before the vote ? 
  when were the polls you talk about taken ? 
  a week prior to the election ? 
  macron got 5 more points or so just after the debate an leaks , which took place on i think tuesday . 
  the live poll i was following ( might have been either from the ft or a french publication ) gave on friday a result of 65-35 . 
  i believe that ipsos last poll was also at 65,5 . 
  what ? 
  polls predicted a win by 65 to 35 % , how 's that inaccurate ? 
  ** 61 % of french people are happy ** about something , wtf, 
  aachen in german , aix-la-chapelle in french . 
  same for constantinople , problem solved . 
  what would you expect , it 's the cgt, 
  oh i agree , i 'm just complaining ( hey i 'm french !, 
  ha-ha ... ) that we see so fucking often brits and other idiots going all uuuuuhhh remember the war . 
  go fuck yourself with the war and stop being cunts , that 's what some people need to learn . 
  i was never anti british or anti american , but people like this , that i have actually met in real life too , are those pushing normal people to become polarised . 
  while i do not particularly like your opinion , somebody went on to downvote you without taking the time to voice his opinion , which i find cowardly . 
  i see . 
  do n't remember doing anything , but sure . 
  i prefer that to the anti france and anti eu articles posted some times daily by the same poster , who then proceeds in the comments to write more inflammatory things, 
  i thought du was not illegal, 
  cluster bombs ? 
  lol , no industry ... 
  while partly true , they were not exactly alone . 
  snotty attitude for hoping that the current status quo of france ends up being beneficial ? 
  when did i say all lepen voters are looneys ? 
  i did n't , you just invented it to make yourself more of a victim . 
  i did not vote for le pen because i do n't think she should have been president , and it 's my fucking opinion . 
  would you hope that france `` collapses '' only so that le pen turns out to be right ? 
  we can only hope things go well, 
  is that not even more so the case with trump , what with higher abstention and lesser score ? 
  good to know we french are incapables then ... 
  something like 45 % on revenues if i recall , on private businesses , then there 's a tax , i think , on capital of some sort . 
  many people are skeptical about that `` growth '' , it 's extent and if it 's truly actual growth and not a side effect that is only temporary . 
  were we not talking about greece originally ? 
  i 'm not even talking about that , but whatever . 
  it 's not all `` greece this '' and `` greece that '' . 
  it 's about rising taxes that force private businesses to close , reducing in the long run the amount of taxes that will be available . 
  tell me if that is sustainable . 
  i did not argue about that . 
  the taxes have risen , private companies have buckled under the pressure , the result is that there are less private companies producing wealth . 
  that is unsustainable . 
  i had been flying with them since i was a wee ticke , sooooooooooooo many delays and problems , lost baggages and overbooked flights , especially late 90s and early 00 's, 
  from what i understand it only works because it milks all sectors in an unsustainable way, 
  what do you mean by if even that ? 
  i 'm terrible with french geography but is n't the voges department in lorraine ? 
  bugatti 's french though , made in lorraine . 
  you must be a special type of person to willingly start the whole argument ffs ... 
  well , as the article says , it would be too difficult to change it because it 's a matter fro the legislative branch , thus , right now , it can not be done . 
  i was also replying over something that was different from what the article said , which i had not read at the time . 
  so please , tone it down . 
  i did not but was specifically replying to the person above . 
  last time i checked our official papers , at least those i 've read , do not mention gender . 
  thry mention the sex , and that does n't change by being transgender or by having a different `` sexual expression '' . 
  male or female for now , possibly other if for medical anomalies . 
  if a person has a dick , he can feel however he wants but if there 's no anomaly he 's a male . 
  that 's it . 
  they have said and said and said . 
  nothing has been decided yet . 
  i do not know the specifics of the agreements , but to me it sounds like a contract , break it and you are getting the short end by having to still pay what you agreed to . 
  i also did not see any mentions of what you said , i read about farms but not science grants . 
  i still do not see it . 
  i read an article that seems more like a lot of gossip and assumptions that are all over the place . 
  from what i seem to get , the money in question is money that the uk would have paid after multiple agreements/programs had come to an end . 
  that is reasonable on its own , unless if said programs are renegociated/drafted , which has not yet happened . 
  when was that might i ask ?
