   this is not about greece ... all these stuff started with the memorandums.our system was not like that . 
  i believe that the whole pre paid taxes story started before tsipras , if that 's what you mean ? 
  the problem with assad being deposed is the probable pogrom against the alawites , while if there was a transition without violence it could be avoided . 
  france and britain until the war , then the us entered the game , sacrificing everything in the name of energetic independence , making oil stockpiles and whatnot . 
  france and britain where there as colonists , making these places their homes , the us just goes picking the resources and leaves . 
  i does n't make france and britain innocent , but i doubt the bulk is caused by them , ** especially not today , 70 years after **, 
  greece also has a system where the year 's taxes are paid , but the next year 's taxes are prepaid , by 50 % . 
  therefore when the state says the tax will be raised to 29 % ( did n't reach as much i think , but it 's between 26 and 29 ) it actually means 29 +29 / 2 = 43.5 % . 
  without counting emergency state withdrawals , social charges , potential additional taxes and maybe more . 
  why would any company go work in greece with such policies ? 
  especially with tsipras wanting to simply make the taxes double , instead of one and half . 
  i was defending him too the other day when people complained on that aspect but he really needs to start rethinking his policies . 
  he does n't bother me when he does that , as long as he writes both languages , but he does seem to be agenda driven , more and more . 
  https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk apparently it 's called minsk too . 
  perhaps statistically it 's true ? 
  or in a specific place ? 
  papazoglou was indeed quite fantastic , many saying the best of his generation along with a couple of others . 
  on the second half only . 
  calling it metal was a bit inaccurate tho : /, 
  i 'll be checking it out . 
  greek songs ; rather well known https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_6cdc5ygs8 ( every 2-3 weeks i was eating lunch with him on the next table , couple of times on the same table , great guy ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrlrpl_vca https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9cxa-rofke ( ww2 song ) there are some great byzantine era ones and slavery time but i 'm not versed enough . 
  there are also some rare ancient greek ones . 
  a `` band '' made a `` metal '' version , i think it 's this one , haggard . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg9rc9sbas0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoftnod3srw and also au 31 du mois d' aout you might like these op . 
  in the same spirit there 's corrigan fest and les charbonniers de l'enfer , or something of the sort . 
  do you expect a modern approach from something that 's two thousand years old ? 
  back then it was revolutionary , now not . 
  why would you teach lgbt + people to deal with their problems by employing religion , especially since religion does n't focus on them in the first place . 
  just some bloke said that homosexuals should be homosexuals and whatnot , well let him be . 
  to me asking of christianity to deal with these issues/take care of these people is like asking from a catholic priest to marry a muslim with a budhist , it 's completely out of question because these are not the target demographics . 
  and to be fair in the hypothetical scenario where a member of the lgbt + community needs help and goes to a church , if the priest is a true believer he will start by trying to give counsel that is good for the kid rather than pray . 
  not all priests are a bunch of inactive old schmucks who 'd better pray than help people themselves . 
  and that has nothing to do with a `` true scotsman '' line of thinking . 
   like the vatican being very opulent and yet there are christians and people of other faith starving in the streets . 
  i am not saying the vatican does n't help but it surely does n't need all the gold it has . 
  vatican does n't need interiors laden with gold yet it is everywhere . 
  yet the vatican is one of the organisations with the largest donations , perhaps ** the ** largest one . 
  you do have a point , they could do * more * , but i do n't think that it 'd be very useful , what with the us sacrificing anything they can in the altar of energetic independence . 
  the first group of people from the troika were said to be pretty arrogant , so if it 's the case then there may be problems with him , if he was in that group . 
  it 's not common sense , believe me . 
  considering there was a time when killing/invading somebody could simply have the pretext of `` i did n't like his mug '' it was rather needed . 
  in any case the vatican is a representative , supposedly , so in all they may have diverted from the original meaning . 
  if they vatican says x guy ca n't marry because we ( god ) say so , then fuck them , you ca n't marry in a church but nobody stops you ( depending on the country ) to have access to a civil union . 
  it 's their party and they do what they want , you go have your own party . 
  why do you even care ? 
  the core of christianity is to love your neighbour , which by the non-asshole definition means everybody else . 
  whether you are christian , atheist , pastafarian or whatever it does n't matte as long as you are good/decent to people . 
  if some chose to be in oen religion good for them , live and let live . 
  it concerns european media , therefore europe . 
  dclauzel is rather weird at times ... 
  giving transcripts of videos for those without enough bandwidth/on mobile , that 's great , thanks !, 
  not if put that way but if i recall well , germany has 15 million turks , while 20 % of france 's population are of north african decent . 
  it 's not like they never had an issue . 
  besides , immigration today is as much an issue for greece as for germany , so whether or not it 's fair , in any case the border countries will suffer the most . 
  what germany does , for once , is to take off pressure off greece which is already pretty crushed . 
  but by no way is it a german problem only now . 
  go tell greece ... a decade ago they were said to harbor three quarters of a million of irregular immigrants ... 
  besides , you were/are pretty eager to take them in , inspite of the problems that have been caused . 
  luckily the syrians do n't have giant worms to put up with . 
  ah , all-right . 
  for some reason i assumed you meant those who i.e. 
  have the opposite opinion with you . 
  my apologies . 
  as if france , germany and italy ( and spain , greece ) had n't been taking refugees for years before ... 
  bound from kavala to limnos , which was the worse line for years we had a delay of 5 or 10 minutes . 
  we arrived half an hour earlier than suggested . 
  everybody was like the fuck ? 
  is that limnos or thasos ( an island on the `` road '' ) . 
  strange , i do n't see so much garbage . 
  sure , it exists , but it 's not everything and not `` almost all '' in my opinion . 
  now , if you do n't agree with them , that 's another story but i do n't think that qualifies as garbage . 
  they stay on the islands then , which will start overflowing , with shit like calais seeming like a walk in a park . 
  we can always house them on the averof , it 's useless anyway . 
  luckily they did n't come last year or the year before , the ship lines took many liberties , delaying as they see fit . 
  this year was a stellar one thought , the ships even broke records i had n't see for the past 15 years . 
  i see . 
  they are used to harsh days with the sun over them . 
  i 'd be more worried if they have enough supplies for the trip rather than the exhaustion . 
  well that 's what i 'm saying for the past 10 comments ... 
  \u00af \\ _ ( : / ) _ / \u00af perhaps permits , not enough educated personnel ( i think an agronome is required to set up the business ) , the funds required may not be easily found for people in that line of work . 
  one thing of note is that there are slaughterhouses that do the job right , with correct commissions and that not all of the farmers are in a bad situation , however sending the animals there may in the long run be as unprofitable , or more than the usual way , because of transports . 
   the only way it can be a good thing is if there 's a long term plan to make the business model sustainable . 
  otherwise , you 're just prolonging the agony at great expense to the state budget - achieving nothing in the long term . 
  usually that 's the spirit , yes , or to try and re-hire a portion of the workers somewhere else or in the factories of the next guy . 
  ** usually **  the thing that bothers me is that the supermarkets are n't squeezing the slaughterhouses more . 
  if the margins you give are true , they would indicate a shortage of them in france . 
  is there no competition in this layer of the industry ? 
  well in the past two years i think the supermarkets started pushing harder against the slaugherhouses and other intermediaries but what they did was simply absorb the loss of profit by decreasing the prices they got from the farmers . 
  a bit like orders that come down from the top of the chain of command to the little soldier/policeman who 's a bit lost . 
  as for the competition , there should be enough in terms of numbers , but it seems that they have agreed more or less on their prices , like the us telecoms do , like the french ones did ( perhaps still do ) and many other sectors . 
  perhaps there 's another underlying problem , like the permits , a situation similar to the taxis , not allowing the intermediaries to lower prices , but that sounds like a stretch . 
   and there we have it !, 
  the government using taxpayer resources to secure its narrow political interests instead of using them for the public good . 
  i 'm against that . 
  are you in favour of it ? 
  partly , yes . 
  if it means farmers get their due and then sod off , then yes . 
  what i am not in favour with is the government giving blank promises for years waiting for the situation to turn critical or for things to degenerate , that 's the real issue . 
   because the intermediaries are n't asking for state intervention in a matter of private commerce . 
  that is n't a normal thing .
