  when the government meddles in people 's business , they should have a good reason for it . 
  they have their bread buttered , why would they want state intervention ? 
  why would a monopoly holder want state intervention ? 
  breaking a monopoly ( oligopoly ) is not a good reason ? 
  i would disagree . 
   why this special treatment for the farmers and not the people who get sacked in other areas ? 
  also , this is a small number compared to the population . 
  when a large amount of people are being sacked the state , for better or worse intervenes . 
  some times it 's a good thing , other times it just adds oil to the fire . 
   and who decides what 's representative ? 
  why not 100 $ more than that , or 300 $ less ? 
  hat if the nature of the job changes due to technology or some other reason ? 
  i do n't know but since the farmers ca n't survive much longer while slaughterhouses are becoming rich i think there is a need for re balancing . 
  i do n't want to say that the situation must be inversed , not at all , but if the slaughterhouses and other intermediaries increased the price at which they bought by even 20-30 % and lowered by 20-30 % their prices to super markets a big chunk of the problems would go away , magically . 
   maybe the farmer should sell the farm and start a slaughterhouse . 
  or maybe this is one sided information that serves the farmers alone . 
  who to sell to ? 
  it 's unprofitable and they do n't have the capital to start a slaughterhouse from scratch . 
  also , quoting is making life easier . 
  well that tiny part of the population could become unemployed , a big amount of them , which is not a political cost the government , or any government would like to have . 
  as for what you said about getting value for money , why should the farmers be in question and not the intermediaries ? 
  that is also a great problem with greece and a reason why many sectors are in big trouble because of intermediaries , although there it 's because of the sheer amount of companies and not so much their prices . 
  also , having such disparities in the chain is not equitable and if i recall well such gross profiteering is also illegal . 
  i do n't know to which degree thought . 
  you may have missed that comment , but here are the sources http://www.rt.com/news/germany-sarin-gas-syria-040/ http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/berlin-wont-name-german-companies-involved-in-syrias-c-weapons-program/2015/01/24/ http://theweek.com/articles/441993/how-western-companies-sneakily-sold-chemical-weapons-components-syria-iraq http://www.jpost.com/middle-east/german-firms-helped-assad-family-build-syrian-chemical-weapons-program-bombshell-report-alleges-388750 at the time nobody knew they were salafists to be heard , they knew there were some `` extreme elements '' between them , so i guess my original wording was rather poor . 
  if so , then why was it not the case 20 or so years ago ? 
  there were even more farmers back then too , why was n't there such an issue ? 
  i would even argue that since the amount of supermarkets has increased , and so did the population , and so the average amount of meat we consume ( 50 % since the 60 's if i recall correctly , say 10 % since the 90s . ), 
  why did the situation for one part of the chain become so much worse ? 
  i also apologise for calling you a nincompoop . 
  because if they do n't they 'll become another mass of unemployed . 
  also , if you want more money each month , think if you should get a raise , and if you think you should get a raise go ask your boss , i dunno . 
  in 1880 the iron workers wanted more money and rights , which after bloodletting was given to them more or less . 
  the difference is that then they were almost like slaves belonging to people such as carnegie , dying on the job while today farmers are slaves to themselves and intermediaries , dying by their hands . 
  i agree that there have been times when the wages that were asked were unrealistic and so on , but in this case it is quite legitimate , at least in my humble non-trained opinion which goes along the line that in a chain everybody should get a wage representative of the job he does . 
  a cow can be processed by a slaughterhouse in a day , a farmer needs how much time , a year , two to have them grow up . 
  that 's the whole thing , nobody has a problem with current prices , nobody complains except the farmers , and they ca n't buy from the netherlands or buy domestic . 
  me neither , apart from chemical weapons , which saw limited use compared to the usual ones . 
  you nincompoop , i 've already said this how many times , the prices on the farmer side are super low , the prices on the slaughterhouse side super high and on the supermarket side a bit higher !, 
  the magic you claim is called price fixing from the slaughterhouses , they increase the price by 500-600 % !, 
  the super markets add their share , which does n't seem to be that huge , increasing by another 100-200 % ( on the price given by the farmers , or maybe 20-30 % more than the slaughterhouse prices , at a glance ) . 
  the problem is not the end price , since it 's been stable for the past years more or less , the problem is the beginning of the production chain being made of lead while the next one is made of gold and the next is made of copper . 
  i 'm running out of ways to explain what i mean , so i wonder if there might not be something wrong with my ways of expression ... 
  well there is supply in the netherlands if that 's what you 're asking . 
  in france it 's simply adequate . 
  besides , if we want to completely go for an amalgam the why not just buy the meat from bulgaria or elsewhere where the price is even lower ? 
  as if we needed more lower standards or more globalisation . 
  why should certain companies be able to fix their prices artificially ? 
  and at the expense of everyone else ? 
  no , just the intermediaries , since they increase the price by 500-600 % and in the end the product is sold for almost 1000 % more . 
  the farmers do n't :  if the farmers think they can do better by running their own stores there is none of this , they just ask for better terms which they ca n't get when dealing with the intermediaries because they have nothing to lose , while the farms do . 
  all-right . 
  i see . 
  sorry for the second message , for the uk : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-uk-government-let-british-company-export-nerve-gas-chemicals-to-syria-8793642.html another source i forgot : http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/us-syria-crisis-germany-sarin-idusbre98h0qb20130918 france : http://english.alarabiya.net/en/news/middle-east/2015/05/06/france-delivered-weapons-to-syria-rebels-book-reveals.html and for both , although 2010 might not be early enough . 
  yes indeed , germany did n't join in as the wikipedia article also states . 
  personaly i do n't criticize the eu too much for libya soit 's not much of an argument in the first place . 
  as for sources , i expected ammunition , turns out it 's chemicals : http://www.rt.com/news/germany-sarin-gas-syria-040/ http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/berlin-wont-name-german-companies-involved-in-syrias-c-weapons-program/2015/01/24/ http://theweek.com/articles/441993/how-western-companies-sneakily-sold-chemical-weapons-components-syria-iraq http://www.jpost.com/middle-east/german-firms-helped-assad-family-build-syrian-chemical-weapons-program-bombshell-report-alleges-388750 they seem kinda dodgy as far as sources go tho ... 
  i see . 
  you sure they made asbestos ? 
  you say `` cheaper '' . 
  it wo n't be cheaper because of import . 
  the problem though is not in the end product being too expensive , not at all !, 
  it 's the farmers not getting enough out of the slaughterhouses , which manage to make a lot more profit than the producers do . 
  that may be caused by price fixing on behalf of those intermediaries . 
   so what ? 
  in france there is this idea that if you make profits , that 's bad . 
  please do n't jump on conclusions . 
  the situation is that farmers ca n't turn up a profit while both intermediaries and supermarkets are making ** huge ** profits . 
  it 's a problem of balance . 
  you also speak of international trade , but there is none , it 's all about local goods being transformed by local companies and sold by local super markets . 
  it 's all a local problem , nothing to do with international sales and whatnot . 
  the whole wide issue does n't have much to do with competitiveness or poor/huge production , it 's the result of companies strangling the small producer because they can . 
  just like it has always happened everywhere in the world in the past , only that the farmers fight back . 
  another reditor pointed out how australian supermarkets are fleecing the local farmers to maximize their ** profits ** it 's not even a problem of turning a profit for the upper steps of the system , it 's how to make the most money , how to squeeze the most out of the lower steps . 
  i 'm not a communist , but that is the reality of things currently in france for the farmers , the situation is simply badly balanced . 
  but you can apply for asylum or to migrate , no ? 
  there is no oversupply tho ... 
  the netherlands have an oversupply and the eu fines them , no such thing in france . 
  the problem of inefficiency would be null if there was not a clear solution found in accord with the state , the farmers , intermediaries and the distribution . 
  there 's the grand weak link . 
  if i recall well they were part of the coalition that bombed libya , but that 's irrelevant , what i meant was selling weapons . 
  the uk and germany and probably france sold weapons/ammunition to the syrian rebels , some of which were/are salafists . 
  i meant countries with a german embassy , not being part oft he schengen area . 
  considering greece already ** is ** feeding and helping and rescuing immigrants for the past ** ten years ** that may be a stretch but at the same time is not the responsibility of any european country , except for those who 'd started a war/situation , which means france , the uk , germany and whoever else sold weapons to the region . 
  just like saccharine i 'd bet ... 
  germany has things to give thought , which may not be the case for the rest of the eu , apart from the uk , nordics and maybe france . 
  probably also in serbia , spain , ukraine , hungary , austria etc etc. . . 
  i do n't think you are correct there but france and others eu countries prefer being 100 % self sufficient in certain fields , at least as much as possible . 
  we currently mostly are self sufficient but the one who profits the most is the big distribution and the intermediaries while the producer does not . 
  this is a problem of balance that needs to be established , which is much less painful than doing other things . 
  besides , buying from other countries brings the import costs , which would increase the overall price in the long run , therefore is counter productive . 
  there are no farms in paris though . 
  nor in marseille , nor it lille or lyon or bordeaux . 
  people wo n't take their car for 10-30 km to go get their weekly groceries . 
  when it 's market day , and if there is such a day in parts of a city people go there , supporting the producer . 
  therefore they care , up to the point where it 's viable for them . 
  for example i live closeby to more or less a ghetto in a northern-east town of france , therefore have either to choose between shitty aldi or lidl , the turkish supermarket and the small vegetables/fruit market . 
  there 's a carrefour , which i tend to prefer , but it 's too far , therefore i 'll do what is in my economic and gustative interest , which is pick the small markets . 
  if the situation was the opposite i would n't walk 5-10 km just to get the the market , buy my shit and then come back with all the weight . 
  i think it 's quite a key industry if the country is to stay independent in that regard .
