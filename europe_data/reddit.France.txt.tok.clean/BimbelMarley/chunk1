the french muslim community has recently started to do just that but the public opinion is still growing more and more hostile against them . 
  that 's really not how ecosystems work . 
  after the chernobyl disaster , french authorities basically said that there 's nothing to worry about because the radioactive materials would not reach france and published those ridiculous maps where it stops right at the border . 
  it 's become a running joke in france when there 's something happening in europe : do n't worry , it 's not gon na cross the border !, 
  i thought nowa hutta is a district of nal hutta . 
  i thought you were so rich that you invented something liked smartphones but with food , cleverfood !, 
  something something hypercube , something something jewish physix, 
  it 's really funny how you took his joke question si literally . 
  the black sea can actually be described like that i guess . 
  it 's very warm , has sandy beaches and tourist facilities , making it a great vacation spot for russians , exactly like the mediterranean for europeans . 
  shut up cristiano . 
  or a dutroux reference . 
  mfw he 's in a wheelchair, 
  preemptive strike ? 
  you guys know nothing about how to go on strike . 
  i see what you 're getting at but you sound a lot like a conspiracy theorist . 
  i had absolutely no idea about how high your miltary spending is . 
  very surprising . 
  looking forward to seeing this soon . 
  yeah , i 'm completely clueless too . 
  no it is n't . 
  i 've seen it in the less developed parts of asia but never in europe . 
  wow , 36 billion ? 
  did they have to build mountains completely from scratch or something ? 
  frenchman here . 
  the first ones to come to mind are obviously [ napol\u00e9on bonaparte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon ) and [ jeanne d'arc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeanne_d%27arc ) . 
  they are however often used by right and far right oriented people ( especially for jeanne d'arc ) so it 's a bit loaded . 
  i prefer [ jean moulin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_moulin ) , the symbol of the french resistance . 
  also a very [ classy guy ] ( http://www.lyonmag.com/medias/images/jean-moulin-dr.jpg ) . 
  i have one of those !, 
  bought it in khirgizstan , which is a gorgeous place to visit !, 
  i just hope people older than 30 will contribute , else we 're gon na end up with a dae le 90s kid ?!!, 
  thread . 
  also a very good video game . 
  hey [ common ] ( http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/51373173/common+page1.jpg ) !, 
  no it 's not . 
  everybody in germany thinks it means goodbye but it it is only directed to a person you will never see again . 
  ad banners usually are . 
   said fleur pellerin , france 's digital minister . 
  ** he ** spoke at a press event he ? 
  must be inconceivable for the guy that wrote this that our `` tech '' minister is a [ woman ] ( http://www.itespresso.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fleur-pellerin.jpg.pagespeed.ce.bkka_lkpcv.jpg ) . 
  and lichtenstejnsko , so cute , 
  yes but it 's also 25 \u00b0 -27 \u00b0 in northern sweden and norway . 
  i was raised in germany with a lot of swedish kids 's litterature , tv shows , mainly astrid lindgren ( absolutely loved michel aus l\u00f6nneberga ) . 
  i 've never been theren but to me sweden will always be astrid lindgren 's sweden . 
  do n't know about europeans raised in other parts of europe though . 
  did you have a similar experience ? 
  every every ? 
  every . 
  this is incorrect . 
  guadeloupe , martinique , guyane , r\u00e9union and mayotte are indeed d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer ( dom ) and are part of the eu . 
  the other ones are territoires d'outre-mer ( tom ) ( now collectivit\u00e9s d'outre mer ) which have varying degrees of independance when it comes to laws , taxation , etc. 
  link to wikipedia for those interested : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_departments_and_territories_of_france, 
  moldova and lithuania also picked a slightly different shade of purple . 
  mr bean for president !, 
  goodbye , blue sky . 
  goodbye , blue sky . 
  goodbye . 
  good for the satellite , because i ca n't see shit !, 
  well that 's actually a good question , just give me a few minutes to check my map . 
  plus the `` companies are more powerful than nations '' crap . 
  i do n't fundamentally disagree with this but the way they show it is complete bullshit . 
  the state-owned museums like the louvre or the mus\u00e9e d'orsay are free if you are under 25 years old and from the eu . 
  makes sense , thanks . 
  wait , it was n't `` faites chier la vache '' ? 
  cool , never heard about this . 
  looks like that part of the revolution failed though . 
  still no public toilet in sight . 
  to be perfectly honest i have to say it depends on who does it . 
  i mean , this is the norwegians we 're talking about , there is no animosity at all between our countries and they 're usually pretty peaceful so i do n't think this should be taken seriously . 
  what do they mean in this case ? 
  that they are n't officially confirmed to be suicide or that they they do n't want to directly link them the ashley madison hack ? 
  here 's [ queen victoria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/queen_victoria_by_bassano.jpg ) for those who appreciate an actual regal look !, 
  what do you mean by * better * ? 
  pillows , furniture , decoration with the union jack on it . 
   car exident, 
  can i ask why ? 
  i think you mean since instead of until . 
  i 've only heard it used playing battleship . 
  touch\u00e9 , coul\u00e9 !, 
  it was just a joke . 
  that very well could be it . 
  it could also mean that our own spy agencies were/are involved in something similar and do n't want the spotlight to be on them too . 
  zoo roos do n't count as real roos . 
  i 'm actually not really sure what a libertarian is . 
  it is technically impossible to walk on a projection , if you try to walk over a projection , it will be on your feet/body , not under it . 
  wait , why am i trying to bring sense into this ? 
  in other news : half of the greek population surfing reddit all day long . 
  pfff , this guy does n't even remotely look like hitler . 
  yeah exactly like `` heil hitler '' just means `` hail hitler '' . 
  i guess it 's because the flag is supposed to depict the estonian winter landscape , when the leaves of the trees have fallen . 
  well that 's fucked up , i really did n't know you could be arrested for blasphemy in greece . 
  might he have been arrested for being accused of something supposedly worse like death threats or something ? 
  the important thing is : what existing greek laws can have someone arrested like that ? 
  can a greek person be arrested for blasphemy and/or insults ? 
  i 'm not quite following here . 
  it 's surprising that colorectal cancer would be the 2nd most common death cause but how does it relate to fish ? 
  do people get cancer because they do n't eat fish ? 
  or because of bad eating habits in general ? 
  most disgusting lineup so far there finland .
