  doing it during the childhood allow to bypass all of this problem . 
  as someone said in this thread , ban it will just lead to backroom clinics performing it illegally and dangerously , as it happened with abortion . 
  nowadays surgeons are able to do it properly and safely in 20 minutes and the scar is nearly invisible . 
  when i read u/czokletmuss writing `` inb4 americans : i was mutilated by my parents without having any choice on this but that 's okay do n't tread on me reeeeeeeeeeeee '' , basically '' you think you like it but trust me you do n't '' with all the arrogance that come with it and get upvoted , it shows how this sub has turned in a new sneaky r/atheism . 
  this thread is basically people speaking about something they do n't know but `` it looks barbaric and disgusting '' . 
  it 's exactly the same process who leads to homophoby , racism and rejections in other parts of the world but it 's ok because we are the wise occidental who bring modernity and our good practice to the barbaric world . 
  i do n't want to link you pictures that you do n't want to see but trust me , circumcision is not as useless as you think and it actually can save lives . 
  just google `` phimosis '' , it concerns more than 1 % of the male . 
  communist party did n't participate to the presidential elections , they were backing la france insoumise who had 19 % of the vote . 
  they ar doing the same thing for this election . 
  it 's funny that you talk about that because it 's not the case anymore since yesterday . 
  oh , yes true . 
  my bad . 
  dieudonn\u00e9 made 3 % ... even if i do n't like both of them , valls-dieudonn\u00e9 would have been a priceless second round . 
  it 's not the real names of the parties . 
  when you see `` extr\u00came droite '' it 's often jean-marie le pen 's candidates ( the party is named france 's party if i remember well ) . 
  whe you see `` extr\u00came gauche '' it 's often candidates from force ouvriere or things like that , which are syndicates and not parties . 
  you need 60 deputies to request a review by the constitutional council , only lr will be able to do it in the 5 years to come . 
  even if the left decide to unit , they wo n't be enough . 
  jean-christophe cambadelis ( first secretary of the socialist party ) is out . 
  nicolas bay ( general secretary of the national front ) is out ( 20 votes below the second ) . 
  isabelle attard who was one of the only candidate to be endorsed by all the leftist parties is out nathalie kosciusko-morizet is not in a good shape too . 
  benoit hamon is out . 
  what a mess, 
  people who said that do n't understand how the world works right now . 
  mostly people from the past who benefit from the former cleavages . 
  melenchon and marine le pen have disapointed a lot of people + we know since 2 weeks than lrem will win this + a lot of people do n't understand that this election is more important than the presidential one + the weather was hot, 
  as u/enyss said , candidates with at least 12.5 % are qualified for the second round . 
  most of the time it 's only 2 but this year , in some circonscriptions , i would n't be surprised to see 4 candidates in the second round . 
  edit : because of the low turnouts , it would be nearly impossible to have more than 2 candidates in most of the circonscriptions, 
  hey . 
  i voted because of u/taenk , even if i know who will win my circonscription because i live in poitiers aka `` the center left of france in every sense of the word '' . 
  oh thank you my dear , i did n't want to go to vote because meh , and now , because of you , i feel like the eu destiny depends on me and i must go to the polling station or frexit . 
  really thank you . 
  the problem in france is that everybody wants everything to be reformed except if it concerns them . 
  yeah , even if i support him , macron is overrated out of france . 
  this summer , when he will begin to reform the labour law , it will be fun . 
  jaroslav plasil is a good player . 
  hated by far right and far left yes . 
  others people are ok with his program . 
  1er octobre 1977, 
  well , obama [ said approximately the same thing in 2013 ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/09/06/president-obama-and-the-red-line-on-syrias-chemical-weapons/?utm_term=.e3e38ec0a1b5 ) . 
  he is threatening assad but i 'm not sure that if it happens again he would really react . 
  and i guess that only makes you worse . 
  they destroyed it and pretended that they ca n't install one when hollande said `` i 'm yasuo main '' . 
  well have a nap, 
  wtf ? 
  i mean , it 's not leftists who organized this event . 
  anne hidlago is clearly one of the most leftist mayor of a french big city , so leftists litterally banned the festival . 
  this is made by some controversial french associations who are looking for buzz and who are not politicized at all ( they shit on everyone , especially leftist who are not enough `` antiracist '' for them ) . 
  hard to call him a conservative . 
  he 's clearly closer from macron than from sarkozy . 
   i love their huge super markets like super/hyper u , carrefour , champion , auchan , super/hypermarch \u00e9 etc. 
  champion does n't exists anymore , it has been bought by carrefour and now it 's name `` carrefour market '' . 
  it 's just like carrefour but with `` market '', 
  as long as you say `` chocolatine '' you can come but if you begin to talk about `` pain au chocolat '' you will stay with uncle trump my fellow kid . 
  [ baguette magique ] ( http://www.goldenmoustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hp1.jpg ), 
  you can notice that this entire corner have voted for macron when a great part of the idiots in the rest of france have voted for marine le pen . 
  bordeaux was elected `` best european destination '' in 2015 and the best wines in the world come from here ( bordeaux , cognac , ... etc. ) . 
  we are the french culture . 
  we are chocolatine . 
   major teams of the french ligue 1 are psg [ paris saint-germain ] and l'om [ olympique marseille ] . 
  also on the subject of football , the stade de france and the parc du prince are < 3 < 3 < 3 ok . 
  i hate you . 
  the greatest french club is of course girondins de bordeaux . 
  marseille have n't win a game at bordeaux since 1977 , how can you call them a great club ? 
  the last time they won at bordeaux , jimmy carter was the new president of the us , germany was divided in two parts and half of the european countries did n't even exists . 
  ( bordeaux-marseile is actually taking place next sunday btw ) . 
  also : matmut atlantique  stade velodorme  parc ol  parc des princes  french food is delicious , i would eat pain au chocolat every morning for breakfast and a baguette for lunch if i could . 
  triggered . 
  please , i beg you , never call a chocolatine `` pain au chocolat '' again . 
  it 's maybe the greatest debate of all time in our country and you can find [ dozens of maps about it ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=carte+chocolatine&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewijrj69n-ptahvd7hokhr_sdp0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=961 ) i do n't know if france will survive to this debate tbh . 
  yeah the scarecrows costume is insanely good . 
  the text is also very nice , i particularly like the `` i do n't blame you for that '' . 
  i will definitely watch this movie asap . 
  wtf it 's better than some movies which are released nowadays, 
  youngest french leader for a while . 
  napoleon was 40 . 
  65 % wow, 
  1 minute hype, 
  lol magic system ( [ this group ] ( http://www.non-stop-people.com/sites/non-stop-people.com/files/styles/article/public/styles/paysage/public/images/2015/04/magic_system.jpg?itok=map2o3mt ) ) will sing before macron 's speech . 
  i ca n't wait for r/le _ canard 's reaction . 
  why should we be worry about argentinian elections ? 
  something weird is going on ? 
  lol it seems that north america understood that globalism  tardism, 
  it 's made to prevent dictatorship or this kind of thing , you have to take at least two ballots ( even at the first round ) so your vote will be secret anyway . 
  nobody can see what you finally put in the enveloppe . 
  you do n't have to throw the second one , it 's just an option . 
  personnaly i 've kept mine because a sheet of this size is perfect to prepare my shopping list for tuesday . 
  no , [ edith cresson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89dith_cresson ) was prime minister between 1991 and 1992 . 
  i do n't know [ but he said that he want a woman as prime minister ] ( http://www.europe1.fr/politique/quelle-femme-premier-ministre-pour-macron-2998661 ), 
  if someone is interested , this is the schedule for the weeks to come : ** may 8 : ** world war 2 commemoration , hollande will be with the next president . 
  ** may 13 or 14 ( they will choose a date but it 's likely to be the 14 ) : ** investiture of the new president . 
  ** may 15 : ** nomination of the new prime minister and his ( likely to be her if macron is the new president ) government . 
  ** june 11 & 18 : ** legislative election ** june 19 : ** depending of the result of the legislative elections , the president could have to change his government . 
  do n't know about the translations , i 'm not watching this stream but he just destroyed her . 
  she 's definitely over , dupont-aignan is crying at this very moment and marion mar\u00e9chal le pen is opening a bottle of champagne . 
  you just need the `` top 5 tv channel they like to watch '' to understand the power of the media in elections . 
  the dark sacred night, 
  yes , and french people are actually french americans living in the french usa and trying to speak french english .
