  can we pretend that this did n't happen ? 
  ( i 've mingled ireland with northern ireland :( ), 
  i 'm glad that you 're no longer part of the eu then . 
  jean-marie le pen said that the ceremony honoured more the homosexual than the policeman . 
  also hollande did n't back macron before the first round . 
  he said many times that he wo n't choose before the end of the first round ( he , of course , could n't endorse macron since he 's part of the parti socialiste and hamon was still here ) . 
  la suppression du rsi ? 
  le pen and melenchon are the worst ennemies . 
  in 2012 she distributed [ melenchon 's false placards in arabic ] ( http://images.sudouest.fr/2012/05/31/57ecc05866a4bdfb7ce023d4/widescreen/1000x500/le-document-est-traduit-dans-un-arabe-approximatif.jpg ) . 
  during a debate she refused to talk to him because `` he was n't a real candidate '' . 
  he insulted her many times , i ca n't count the number of lawsuits between this two person . 
  he 's pro immigration and want islam to be treated just like christianism and judaism . 
  she 's the opposite . 
  so a small part of jlm voters will join her ( mainly the ones who quited her to join jlm ) but the biggest part will join macron for his social project and to fight against far right or just abstain . 
  i need to know the source . 
  but everybody said that the vote for brexit would be close . 
  nobody said that the yes had no chance to win . 
  you also ca n't compare a referendum and a presidential election, 
  most of the eastern countries are for it . 
  with the second european power on their side , germany would have no choice but accept it . 
  it 's not . 
  historically , the region where the fn support is the stronger is provence , a region full of rich retirees . 
  we also do n't have a bipartite system and the president is elected by direct popular vote , cliton would have win with this condition . 
  it 's just not relevant to compare the two situation . 
  melenchon is not anti-eu . 
  how many time do we have to say it ? 
  he wants to change it not to leave it . 
  can you please stop to compare the situation in the us and in france . 
  our societies are completely different , this comparison are not relevant at all . 
  you really think that melenchon will endorse macron ? 
  lol . 
  in 2012 he endorsed hollande and he 's still paying for it today . 
  and he ruined everything for melenchon . 
   downvotes should be reserved for comments that do not contribute anything to the discussion . 
  downvote = / = moderation . 
  maybe i 'm wrong but comments that do n't contribute anything to the discussion should be deleted , not downvoted . 
   even some random dumb communist and it would get upvoted or just not downvoted . 
  there are no communists in this election . 
  phillipe poutou is the one that you can compare the most to a acommunist and he says that he does n't participate in order to win but to represents the laborers . 
   but the leftists do n't want discussions , they just label everyone a fascist and they 're done with it . 
  funny to see that you do exactly the same thing, 
  downvote = `` i 'm not agree with you '' mate not `` i want to you to shut up '' , we do n't delete your message . 
  if you want to prevent me to downvote , you are the authoritarian . 
  so low ? 
  it 's the second best turnout since 1988, 
  higher turnout is historically bad for extremes . 
  in 2015 , the fn was 1st after the first round with a 49.91 % turnout and 3rd after the second round with 58,41 % turnout and it was just a month after the attacks . 
  the momentum is not behind le pen at all . 
  she just fell in the polls during the last months , from 26 % to 21.5 % . 
  the momentum is behind melenchon but macron will certainly be our next president . 
  you can add that melenchon is a very very good speaker . 
  he began to climb during the two debates , and the polls said that h\u00e9 was the better candidates during both . 
  i do n't know what are your sources because i 'm pretty sure it 's false . 
  there is actually only one french hostage ( sophie p\u00e9tronin ) in the world , i 'm not sure that it would be the case if france was one of the main source of funding for them . 
  it 's well known that sarkozy used to pay but i would be really surprised if we gave an euro since the paris attack . 
  france has certainly negotiate some liberations and i 'm not sure that there are more french hostages now than there used to . 
  we use the `` kill them all '' strategy and the `` wait untill they are bored '' strategy more often though . 
  i think that all situations are different and sometimes thee best decision is not the most heroic one . 
  my emergency plan for everything is called `` mom '' and it always works so i do n't know why it would be different in those situation, 
  omg i would be so fucking proud, 
  in france , en marche has an absolute majority in the parlement when only 30 % of the popilation has vited for them . 
  same for us . 
  baby boomers wants to sacrify worker 's right because of the debt when they are the generation who has created this debt . 
  even if he 's 96 years old , he 's really active on his [ twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/edgarmorinparis?s=09 ), 
  it does n't matter who you are `` supporting '' , you ca n't support killing and inequality . 
  neither the hamas or the israelian govt are supportable at this very moment , you ca n't justify to kill people and avoid diplomacy . 
  from my perspective , people who are supporting the hamas or the israelian govt are just like people who support al-assad . 
  a two-states solution will be hard to set up but at least we need a state with same rights for everybody , a secular country would be very relevant . 
  do you know that everybody in this world who is n't a native english speaker have to learn a new language ? 
  including researchers , ... etc. 
  we do n't ask people to be perfectly fluent just to be able to communicate . 
  if you come with some basic skills , you just live here 6 months and it 's good for you . 
  no , his stupid decisions are making the eur/usd rate climbing and so i earn less money for the same amount of work . 
  i also think that macron is making the confidence in the euro more higher than it should be , it 's ok for now but if it continues like that , well i 'm fucked . 
  i hope no since i 'm paid in dollars . 
  but you know , donald trump is already making me lose some money with his bullshits so that would just be the continuation . 
  emigrate because of terrorism ? 
  that would be very stupid , do you know a place where you 're safe from terrorism ? 
  tbf i think that france is way safer than most of the countries in the world . 
  no environnemental issues , no weapons , a generous people ( if something like the paris attacks would happened in the us , would people open their house unconditionnaly like they did in paris ? ), 
  , we have the gign which is the most experimented anti terrorist unit in the world , ... no reason to leave . 
  english is mandatory . 
  then you can begin to learn latin and sometimes old greek ( around 11yo ) , in most of the school you will have to choose between german or spanish or both when you 're around 13yo . 
  in high school comes italian and sometimes other languages ( in my high school chinese was an option ) . 
  every languages except english are optionnal . 
  same for france , supporting moderate rebel groups . 
  and after i watched it for the first time i thought `` yes , joe hart is a true english goalkeeper . '', 
  yes , i do n't know why it 's called like that but well ... it 's its name . 
  [ mine ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=63.4&amp;d=59.6&amp;g=58.5&amp;s=72.0 ) but it 's an american poll , some questions ( climate change , religions ) are not really questions here since 95 % of the population are agree . 
  i 'm a social liberalist like most of the french apparently even if a great part of r/france is not social liberalist at all, 
  i do n't like it either but he is sometimes a true genius . 
  [ anderlecht-psg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cqb-yybbws ) [ psg-bastia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ultqk-9noea ) [ sweden-england ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzvqcbdaizq ) and sometime a real [ fucker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4xhq1vgb7g ), 
  the images that come when you google banlieue are not really relevant . 
  we call banlieue , the zones that are around big cities , it 's basically the suburb of a big city . 
  neuilly-sur-seine or villejuif for example are considered to be part of the parisian banlieue and if you ggogle it , the images that come are different from the previous ones . 
  the `` scary images '' are photos of what we call `` cit\u00e9 '' , as a descendant of north-african immigrants , my mother and all her family have grown up in a cit\u00e9 and i sometimes visit my aunt and my grandmother who still live in one . 
  it 's not that bad , i like it . 
  if you are between 10 and 25 yo and you live in one or you 're accepted then it will be cool . 
  when you begin to grow up and are in age to have kids you really want to get out of this because of drug dealers and the violence ( you can compare it to american ghettos ) . 
  when i was young , i used to go in la grande borne which is known as one of the most dangerous `` cit\u00e9 '' in the country but except some burned cars , i 've never seen something really dangerous .
