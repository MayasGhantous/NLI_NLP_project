  pants as in jeans, 
  until 2012 , there was a law that made it illegal for women to wear pants . 
  it was not enforced and it was abrogated in 2012 . 
  runes are associated with neo nazis ? 
  i knew the celtic cross and stuff like that were associated with it , but runes ? 
  i mean that 's only an old language . 
  fuck these guys they appropriate everything . 
  if your family has an immigrant background , the young people who are proud of it will probably get a tattoo written in their language ( portuguese , spanish , italian but not maghrebis usually ) . 
  otherwise it is mostly animals , art-abstrait and sentences like `` only god can judge me '' . 
  men sometimes get maori tattoos because it became popular with rugby players having them . 
  personnally i would like to get tattoed nordic runes not because i 'm from there but because i like calligraphy . 
  it depends to be honest . 
  brie is fucking good . 
  same for cantal , camembert , basque cheese too , all goat cheeses , edam , mimolette , cheddar ( especially old cheddar ) , gouda , mozzarella , parmiggiano . 
  a lot of cheeses are good and they all deserve to be on our plates . 
  i would like to , but it 's really far away . 
  for instance i 'd rather go to iceland before svalbard . 
  plus i do n't feel like there 's really much to see in svalbard except for the nature . 
  here poll institutes just take a `` sample '' of the population meaning they use national statistics and contact 1000 persons who represent the proportion of each social class , jobs , genders and stuff like that . 
  so if anyone fucks up while collecting the information about these persons , the poll can be extremely variable . 
  polls suck . 
  they are manipulated as if they were 100 % reliable and it makes me angry . 
  also they tend to be used in order to push some candidates . 
  if you look to have fun and spend less money , you should stay in barcelona for more time than heading straight to venice . 
  venice is outrageously expensive whereas barcelona and its outskirts are more moderate . 
  looking to answer this question , i learned that there are only 10 national parks in france which considering the size of the country + the dom-tom is not that * huge . 
  they are mostly in the south of the country from the massif central down to the pyrenees mostly . 
  [ here 's a list of the national parks and a map to locate them ] ( https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2017/08/1488041085-national-parks.png ) edit : the number is not that huge actually . 
  conscious rap is something that really makes me cringe most times . 
  they talk about issues i know , i do n't need a rapper to tell me things i already know . 
  plus it makes me angry because these issues usually enrages me . 
  well , i like conscious rap , it 's just not my thing right now . 
  used to listen a lot of conscious rap when i was in high school like four years ago , now trap 's my thing . 
  i have so much songs that i like but i 'm going to try to make a short list of the songs i like the most in french rap . 
  [ lacrim - pocket coffee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwy30tjdyam ) french rapper [ nekfeu - temp\u00eate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jndfekht7co ) french rapper [ joke - 2014 \u00e0 l'infini ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2173x9kmy0 ) french rapper [ set & match - kush ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70l22xzul6c ) french rappers [ damso - bruxellesvie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vspgfzeuma ) belgian rapper , friends with booba [ lunatic - le crime paie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqotc2zrhpg ) french rappers , booba and ali [ caballero & jean jass - merci beaucoup ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6jtkoawoe8 ) belgian rappers [ sneazzy - n17 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pninwhkvdco ) french rapper , friends with nekfeu ( and if you want to discover more french rap , look for pnl , vald , joke 's discography and pm me if you want good songs ), 
  almost everyone i know wears sneakers . 
  not white though , they look really fresh but you must keep them white so you only wear them on special occasions . 
  parts of our taxes are allocated to the free healthcare , free education and all the stuff you do not pay for like police intervention , firefighters etc. . . 
  do they stop or is it three days straight with no mercy ? 
  well , if they meet the requirements , who am i , simple citizen , to say they do not belong with us ? 
  the criterias are not fulfilled for turkey to join the union , so no . 
  we do not have traffic lights in the middle of nowhere . 
  you 'll have a sign telling you to let pass the car coming from the other side of the intersection but if there 's no one then you go . 
  it 's hard to answer since russia does n't want to join and most of us do n't want turkey to join even though they want to . 
  not that i have a problem with turkish people but their government does n't present the guarantees needed in terms of democracy and border control . 
  not to mention that if turkey joined schengen , we would have a direct border with syria making it really easier for our people to go and fight there and for isis fighters to enter europe . 
  two people died in a city in the pas de calais ( northern france ) , a father allegedly lost his wife , his daugther , his mother and his aunt . 
  some \u00e9piceries are open by night , but i think it is illegal to open a store 24/7 here . 
  in france , english is mandatory when you start middle school ( coll\u00e8ge ) so everyone starts english at 10 . 
  a second language is also mandatory at the beginning of the third year of middle school ( quatri\u00e8me ) and you can choose between spanish , german and italian in some cases . 
  carrefour , auchan and leclerc are the biggest foodstores in my town . 
  they 're really large . 
  no , just that we pronounce it with the french r , which is slightly different that the english r . you probably pronounce it like `` baton wooj '' while we would pronounce it `` baton rooj '', 
  in fact , there 's a special pronounciation of city names for every french city in the us . 
  that applies for saint louis , des moines , sioux falls , baton rouge and so on . 
  we also have the [ coq ] ( https://galerie.alittlemarket.com/galerie/sell/2753233/accessoires-a-accrocher-broche-coq-francais-5-6-cmo--18262959-coq-fr-png-5e89a_big.jpg ) and to refer to the country itself , as a geographical entity we use the hexagon because our country is roughly an [ hexagon ] ( http://frenchfrogs.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/france-hexagone.jpg ), 
  yeah , and if you go around a high school during breaks you will see a lot of teens go out of the school to smoke in front , sometimes with their professors , it is funny to watch . 
  well it depends . 
  some fathers are called this way because they were the pioneers in their field . 
  some of them because they completely changed the way we look at the field itself . 
   smoking is damn expensive those days !, 
  not if you buy it in spain or andorra , 
  yes , a lot . 
  if you compare it with the us it is clearly a problem here i guess , since in some states it is even illegal to smoke in public for teenagers whereas here it is accepted . 
  yeah i know , but when i mean industrial revolution , i mean the british industrial revolution , as in the victorian era . 
  as you may know , industrial revolution came in late here in france . 
  basically we do french revolution , french republic , industrial revolution and straight to wwi, 
  no , no , here bmw 's are highly regarded i guess . 
  they are some of the most expensive cars , buying one is a sign of wealth, 
  wow , the video is really sad . 
  what did socrates do ? 
  i do n't know about you , but i seriously felt like napoleon was a bit forgotten in my history classes . 
  it 's like we went from the industrial revolution to the wwi skipping napoleonic europe . 
  cubans from cuba seem like nice people , living through hard times but having it better than most of the countries in the world . 
  cubans from florida however . 
  i always find it funny when white mexicans act as if they were a minority like african americans or native americans . 
  to me it 's kinda like marie curie . 
  i do n't know how you would consider her since she was born in poland , but most of her work was in france , she studied in france so i guess she 's french . 
  i do n't really know how to deal with those people, 
  which connotation does it have in english ? 
  in french it 's just that we like to shorten words, 
  she was n't born in germany but she got german nationality and spent most of her life in germany . 
  spain/catalonia : lluis companys spain : juan carlos germany : rosa luxemburg , bismarck , charlemagne sweden : zlatan poland : pope john paul ii england : churchill , queen elizabeth , queen victoria italy : garibaldi, 
  yeah but i can totally understand google 's point . 
  what 's the point making a streetview with all the houses blurred ? 
  germany is n't on street view ? 
  til, 
  in french it is called `` esperluette '' and it is an album from the singer julien dor\u00e9, 
  merco = mercedes b-m = bmw, 
  or les states and usa ( with french pronounciation ), 
  yeah , i fucking hate how ac works . 
  especially when you go into a store you walk in you 're hot so it feels like freezing and when you go out you almost faint and on a long period you get a cold in the fucking summer . 
  when i went to mojave desert and death valley yes . 
  where i live i think it gets over 40 \u00b0 c really rarely . 
  35-38 \u00b0 c is the hotest we get every year . 
  yeah you 're right but the last one was before they modified the constitution . 
  before we did n't vote for the president and for the parliament the same year which allowed cohabitation . 
  but you must know that already . 
  i said vodka , not white spirit, 
  i go to spain to buy alcohol , here you ca n't find a bottle of vodka or whisky for less than 20 $ , in spain its almost half the price,
