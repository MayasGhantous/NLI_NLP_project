   what exactly are you talking about ? 
  still some difficulties following a conversation i see . 
  i 'm referring to your initial comment , the nonsense being that people you call leftists defend russia and again i 'm assuming , sorry about that , that you think leftists like putin . 
  that 's all the figment of your bias . 
   if i like eu and do n't like trump , le pen and putin it means i hate everything left-wing ? 
  considering the aforementioned nonsense and that you use `` leftist '' as an insult , you appear to not know modern left-wing stances very well . 
  i 'm not reproaching you for disagreeing , it 's quite normal for people to have different opinions , but for saying things that are n't true . 
  either you 're uninformed or prejudiced , and your history paints you as educated , so which is it ? 
   but liberals do n't ignore that i 'm talking about liberals denouncing le pen for seeing putin , and simultaneously ignoring it by claiming `` leftists '' both hate the far-right and love putin . 
  liberals ignoring the fact that putin helps nationalists in western europe and that `` leftists '' , being internationalists , will strengthen the bonds between european countries , not loosen them like putin would like . 
   or you would try to argue that milne , melenchon or die linke are not pro-russian ? 
  now we 're getting somewhere . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  these people and party being pro-russian or pro-putin is stupid . 
  they criticize both putin 's and nato policies . 
  they advocate for deescalation instead of preparing for war . 
  now i understand what i assume is your position , i 've seen a lot of people defend it here , especially eastern europeans who had to suffer from past russian occupation . 
  that there is no deescalation , that if we appear weak putin will invade one territory after the next , that strong condemnation and military showcasing are the only things keeping him in check . 
  i disagree but i can understand that position . 
  the thing is , it does n't justify calling `` leftists '' pro-russia . 
  being pro- or anti- country is stupid in the first place , it 's assuming being from a specific country makes people good or bad or something . 
  what we can be is pro- or anti- putin , pro- or anti- trump , etc ... considering that , `` leftists '' are anti-putin because the guy 's a despicable asshole . 
  and pro-russia yeah , as in pro-russian-people who have to suffer under putin , and i 'm sure you 'll join me in that . 
  so if you have to call `` leftists '' anything , call them naive . 
  but do n't lend them any sympathy for what putin is doing , please , because they , we , do n't have any . 
  i did assume your political stance . 
  it just seemed to me that one would have to be either a liberal or an anti-russia nationalist to spout such nonsense , and i wanted to err on the side of kindness . 
  after checking your history , seems i was wrong , you look like an ukrainian nationalist that has n't dealt with the cold war trauma and hates anything left-wing . 
  sad , really . 
  feel free to correct me and state your political stance yourself if i am mistaken again . 
   also , ignore what ? 
  considering i was mimicking your own sentence , seems like i was referring to the same thing as you . 
  not that i 'm expecting you to be sensible about anything after your comments in this thread . 
  what 's ~ ~ funny ~ ~ sad is that some liberal will ignore this and continue to pretend leftists like putin . 
  i fail to see how you can negotiate if everyone knows that if they do n't compromise with him he 'll just roll over and go back home without consequences . 
  english translation of a blog post published this morning by jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , left wing candidate to the french presidency . 
  links are my own to provide context about some of the things he refers to . 
  i may have missed some allusions . 
  any ambiguity in the translation is due to my lack of translating skill , especially considering his writing style is more complex than the simple journalistic style . 
  the tone of the blog post is ironic , humorous , but also serious and accusatory . 
  that 's usually his style anywhere . 
  -- the atmosphere lends itself to it . 
  i 'm going to talk about my patrimony . 
  it is n't a new thing . 
  my patrimony was already the subject of publications in all the press during the 2012 presidential campaign despite the far-right gossip that i had refused to to so . 
  my patrimony was declared and controlled when i entered and leaved the vocational education ministry . 
  it was also declared and controlled when i entered and leave the senate . 
  then as well when i was elected as a member of the european parliament . 
  i correct scrupulously , every time i move , with the independent authority whose official job it is . 
  between the declarations , there are changes . 
  but also constants . 
  lets look at them . 
  i did n't inherit [ a castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-marie_le_pen#personal_life.2c_wealth_and_security ) to lodge me , nor a [ political party created by my father ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_front_ ( france \\ ) ) . 
  i do n't pretend to live in [ h\u00e9nin-beaumont ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marine_le_pen#h.c3.a9nin-beaumont_in_2012 ) , i have neither car nor driver . 
  i never benefited from the [ young leaders program from the usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french-american_foundation#notable_alumni ) , nor its equivalent from any country . 
  no [ member of my family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7ois_fillon#fictitious_employment_affair ) has ever been [ my employee ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39346617 ) , nor [ involved in a fiscal scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cahuzac_affair ) . 
  none of my advisors [ open swiss bank accounts for other people ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippe_p%c3%a9ninque ) . 
  the manager of my volunteer security service assuring my year-round protection is n't my employee . 
  he 's a teacher , doctor in philosophy and karate professor . 
  i never owned any [ company handling money ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/francois-fillon-vladimir-putin-meeting-payment-claim-france-presidential-election-a7642316.html ) . 
  i never received any remuneration near or far venezuela , cuba , china , russia , the ivory coast , equator , brazil , tunisia nor any country where some of my friends had influence . 
  it goes without saying that if i gave any advice , they were political and always free !, 
  my patrimony evolved since 2013 because i moved . 
  i had called upon my readers to refer to me to a golden deal if they knew about one . 
  unfortunately , without any effect . 
  i therefor searched . 
  i found , thanks to an agency in my neighborhood , the palace i was looking for . 
  i thus sold my apartment at the time . 
  this product of this sale and a loan allowed me to acquire a bigger apartment ( 110 m2 ) in the same working-class arrondissement of paris . 
  alas it 's situated near the red lights of a big boulevard . 
  but otherwise i 'm happy about it . 
  it cost me 800 000 euros in 2014 . 
  after some remodeling whose exquisiteness has everything to do with my world view , i estimate the value of my main residence at 837 000 euros today . 
  i am still the owner of the same country house . 
  it is n't in valoris or monaco like i could read in far-right hoaxes . 
  it 's around montargis , in the loiret . 
  it 's true that [ deng xiaoping worked there in the renault factory ] ( http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/sub7/item81.html#chapter-5 ) at the time !, 
  it adds to the flattering reputation of `` venice of loiret '' as the ad of the charming g\u00e2tinais capital 's tourism committee says . 
  it 's less chic than the alps-maritimes , but it 's more convenient for a weekend the day after a meeting or a tv show . 
  often times , indiscreet people came to take photos and even tried trespass . 
  i still have the same saving accounts , a `` livret bleu '' , a `` ldd '' and a home-buyer saving plan , for a total of 98 000 euros in case of repair works . 
  i save a lot because i am very well paid at the european parliament , because i inherited from my parents and because i receive royalties for my books . 
  but above all because i do n't have any costly leisure or passions , such as [ clothes ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20170316-france-fillon-faces-inquiry-accepting-gift-48500-euros-suits ) , cars or watches . 
  or anything else . 
  my bank is still the caisse de cr\u00e9dit mutuel of massy . 
  i do n't have any stocks nor any kind of financial investment , which is n't very smart . 
  my debts climb to 165 000 euros . 
  my net patrimony is therefor of 965 000 euros . 
  the increase in the housing market over the last ten years in paris allowed me enrichment without cause that my heir will have to know about . 
  because i myself do n't get any benefit since i live at home and my rent does n't change : it 's the price of my loan . 
  all in all , well-off enough to reassure the small bourgeoisie , but not enough to scandalize my kebab neighbors . 
  after having said what i own , it 's time to talk about what i do n't own , despite what is said on flyers distributed by small groups friend of the le pen , these well known virtue prize winners . 
  i do n't own any luxury car , nor any ordinary one . 
  that 's right , i do n't drive , similarly to a lot of prestigious parisian figures i wo n't speak the name of . 
  i am not senator at the same time as member of the european parliament , firstly because i resigned from the senate in 2009 , secondly because it 's forbidden by the law anyway . 
  i do n't own any other apartment neither in monaco , nor in paris , nor anywhere . 
  i do n't own collectible paintings , a boat , a bicycle , nor horses . 
  i do n't own any pricey watch contrary to the rumor a local [ eelv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_ecology_%e2%80%93_the_greens ) executive spread `` for laugh '' , attributing the information to france info . 
  the radio had the courtesy of immediately denying . 
  one interrogation bugs me : i own approximately 12 000 books i started to accumulate as soon as fourteen years old .
