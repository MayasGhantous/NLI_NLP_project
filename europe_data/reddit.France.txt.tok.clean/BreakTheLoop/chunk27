  yeah . 
  like i said , the fact that he 's liberal , does n't criticize the eu and is n't le pen is pretty much all . 
  half just want a liberal-pro-eu , half just want the best in polls after le pen and fillon . 
  they do n't look at detailed programs . 
  no , you 're saying it 's done specifically to favor `` inefficient domestic market '' . 
  if you bothered to read further than the first sentence , you could stumble upon  according to proponents , these policies can counteract unfair trade practices , to allow fair competition between imports and goods and services produced domestically . 
  or further down  prevent foreign investors from taking control of domestic firms [ ... ] administrative barriers : countries are sometimes accused of using their various administrative rules ( e.g. 
  regarding food safety , environmental standards , electrical safety , etc. ), 
  as a way to introduce barriers to imports . 
  [ ... ] anti-dumping legislation [ ... ] i mean , just read the whole article , there 's even a section on criticism by free-trade proponents you might like . 
  but at least you 'll learn and fight the real meaning of protectionism instead of a strawman . 
  i 'll say this though , there is n't any real comparative advantage today like in the 19th century . 
  sure , at that time , a country produced better bananas , another better dye , another better clothing , another better spices ... today , the only comparative advantages countries have on one another is wage , misery and environmental destruction . 
  techniques and quality differences are marginal . 
  when free-trade lets you import cheaper products , it is not without unfair advantage . 
  a country having little to no worker and environmental protection is an unfair advantage . 
  free-trade is a myth . 
  by importing unfair cheaper products , you export misery . 
  that 's called an [ externality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/externality#negative ) . 
  the money you save with your cheaper phone or clothing or whatever is payed by the foreign workers and population . 
  it does n't just disappear . 
  what protectionists say is : `` you want import into our country ? 
  alright , prove to us your product follows high standards . 
  if it does , the door is wide open . 
  if it does n't , we 'll have to restrict your access . '', 
  [ protectionism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protectionism ) you need to revise your definition . 
  you 're confusing protectionism and isolationism . 
  protectionism is by definition pro-trade and internationalist . 
   it is possible to do trade agreements that are ethical and protect domestic interests . 
  it 's not as extreme as you think it is . 
  well , yeah . 
  that 's called protectionism . 
  there is a steady grow of abstention to all elections for half a century . 
  that , in part , lead to le pen in the second round in 2002 , and made people vote a little more after , but did n't stop the trend . 
  we 're very political and opinionated , but also very fed up . 
  if le pen is in the second round , in my opinion it 's really a coin toss on if people will rally behind the other candidate like in 2002 or if they 'll just say `` not my problem anymore '' and refuse to take part in the farce . 
  [ ... ] fight against corruption is essential [ ... ] [ cooperation and verification mechanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mechanism_for_cooperation_and_verification#benchmarks_for_romania ) ( cvm ) could be phased out [ ... ] would have an impact on any future assessments [ ... ] the commission warns against backtracking [ consequences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mechanism_for_cooperation_and_verification#legal_base ) :  if there are serious shortcomings ... in [ the acceding state ] in the transposition [ of acquis communautaire ] relating to mutual recognition in the area of criminal law ... and ... civil matters ... , the commission may , until the end of a period of up to three years after accession , ... , take appropriate measures . 
  these measures may take the form of temporary suspension of the application of relevant provisions ... in the relations between the acceding state and any other member state ... 
  the safeguard clause may be invoked even before accession ... 
  the measures ... shall be lifted when the shortcomings are remedied . 
  they may however be applied beyond the period [ of three years after accession ] as long as these shortcomings persist . 
  can someone go beyond the legalese here and explain what consequences the eu could apply to romania ? 
  here is the official [ cooperation and verification mechanism document concerning romania ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/l_15720050621en02030220.pdf ) ^ pdf . 
  above quote is article 38 . 
  what does this document * give * that the eu could * take back * ? 
  because honestly this all just reads as another `` please be nice '' , and brow frowning when they are n't . 
  edit : words . 
  which would happen only if hamon agreed to purge 80 % of the socialist party responsible for the situation instead of allowing them to run for mp , which he wo n't do . 
  of course it 's not an accident . 
  it 's done to hurt his candidacy and him personally . 
  it does n't remove anything to what he is accused of having done , and you should n't treat this info differently from if it was released 2 years ago . 
  economically liberal , does n't challenge the eu construction , is not le pen . 
  safe and reassuring for non-french . 
  not my candidate . 
  nah , we just need to know who is paying for his campaign , that 's dirt enough . 
  almost everyone thinks it 's fillon 's own party leaking the infos as revenge , nothing to do with macron or to explicitly favor him . 
  it started with very clear revelations by an investigating newspaper , and fillon himself disastrous communication dug up his own grave by shedding light on even more corruption . 
  the judiciary system starting an investigation so quickly given the clear suspicions is a sign of independence , not pressure . 
  not being anti-russia \u2260 being pro-putin . 
  she does n't have them only if people care enough to vote , and that 's hardly a given . 
  but she ca n't win with only her hardcore supporters , she also needs the fringe hard-right voters that would n't vote for her in the first round . 
  it could be enough to not make them want to vote for her . 
  let 's be correct , her real name is [ marion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marine_le_pen ) . 
  no , that 's like buying a fridge for your home with your company executive funds when it should have paid for restaurant with clients or gas for the company car . 
  not exactly . 
  fillon is accused of having paid his wife for a fake job . 
  le pen is accused of having paid party executives , working in france , with money that should have been used for eu parliamentary assistants . 
  so jobs were done , but not the job intended . 
  still , a misuse of public fund and i hope she tanks because of it during the campaign . 
   eu : competition , free trade , weeeeee !, 
   also eu : where 's my money dude !, 
  where is it gone !, 
  implying being protectionist means being against trade and that the usa , india , china do n't trade . 
  would you have recent articles where schulz speaks of this democratic coup for the eu , or even extracts from his program for chancellorship about what he wants to change in the eu institutions ? 
  the best i could find was [ this old article ] ( https://euobserver.com/political/119284 ) where he seems to want some change , and then [ this much more recent one ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/schulz-and-juncker-a-test-for-eu-democracy-a-1113301.html ) where he seems more content not changing anything and being buddy with tax evasion specialist junker . 
  the eu parliament elects the eu commission president and the commissioners , which is the excuse given to lend democratic legitimacy to the brutalizing policies they imposed on countries such as greece . 
  like i said , you ca n't claim the eu is democratic so it 's institution 's choices are legitimate , and when confronted when bad handling of situations claim the eu parliament and schulz could n't do anything and that it 's not their fault . 
  they could do something . 
  they could have not elected this commission and it 's president in the first place . 
  they could have censured it when they brutalized countries . 
  they did n't . 
  they approved . 
  they are responsible . 
  or you know , put on protectionist barriers on trade with the eu to protect our economy , like every other economic region , instead of allowing anything and everything to flood us and destroy our industries and jobs . 
  i read fine the first time . 
  meaning if there was n't the story about the 5 year old you would indeed be enraged by this ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  you only have one attributed slot of thing you can get enraged over everyday , and the 5 year old already has that slot so you 'll have to gloss over this one ? 
  you ca n't get enraged over several things ? 
  i 'm not asking how they are different , of course they have some commonalities and differences , i 'm asking why you ca n't get enraged by this in particular . 
  and though asking the woman to bear her breast and lactate was a better option than stepping out for five minutes to google `` spectra breast pump '' on the office computer . 
  sure , find excuses . 
  why is that ? 
  electing layers upon layers upon layers of people who ultimately agree on everything , with little prospect of political plurality at the top !, 
  yay democracy !, 
  wow . 
  every time the eu does messed up things through the eu commission or the eu council , people chime in to say that they were elected or operate under the control of the eu parliament so `` it 's democratic , move along citizen '' , but now that a person who enabled the bad policies through his role in the eu parliament seeks public office , he gets a pass because the parliament is suddenly not to blame ? 
  no , he was a full part of it and he gets to share the blame . 
  it 's too easy for everyone to share the praises when good things happen , and reject the fault on everyone else when the shit hits the fan .
