  calling the election of corbyn in the uk a mistake . 
  my sides ... what is this nonsensical blog ? 
  signed with a gun to the temple . 
  some speculate he could do it precisely to undermine his candidacy . 
  on one hand , it would probably work , on the other it would be signing the death certificate of an already dead socialist party . 
  i do n't understand this kind of question . 
  who cares what 's good for the eu , i want what 's good for the european people . 
  sometimes they align , sometimes they do n't . 
  macron may be pro-eu , but whether his suggested policies are good for people or not is entirely subjective and depends on your political leaning . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying `` no '' to or what you want to say really . 
  fwiw i know you just copied the title and do n't blame you for it personally . 
   `` nuclea fusion [ ... ] operating as expected '' just look at the top comments , everyone assuming we 've got sustainable nuclear fusion . 
  on one hand i want to say the title should have limited the scope and managed expectations , on the other i 'm starting to think people over-hyping themselves is the nature of this topic , so maybe you 're right ... 
  it is though . 
  just look at the top comments and people act like we 've achieved nuclear fusion . 
  the article has a bad title , it 's author/editor should know people are going to wrongly assume we 've got a working nuclear fusion reactor and the next step is production scale . 
  so either the journalist/editor is bad at scientific journalism , leaving it to just the last 3 paragraphs to barely dispel the notion we 've achieved sustainable nuclear fusion , or it is intentional and clickbait . 
  either way , misleading . 
  so , is this an economically liberal green or and anti-capitalist green ? 
   ** genoa g8 : some protestors were tortured , admits the italian police chief **  * by eric jozsef , rome correspondant -- july 20th 2017 at 13:25 *  in an interview to `` la republica '' wednesday , franco gabrielli acknowledges the brutalities committed by law enforcement during the 2001 summit , during which a young man died and several wounded were identified . 
   * `` the management of public order at the genoa g8 was simply catastrophic . '' * it will have taken sixteen years almost day to day after the death of the young protester carlo giuliani , on july 20th 2001 , for italian authorities to officially recognize their responsibility . 
  in an interview to the daily * la republica * this wednesday , the chief of the police franco gabrielli , in function since april 2016 , thus admitted that `` a posteriori apologies '' were n't sufficient and that it was now needed to face head-on the brutalities committed , over several days , during and aside the international summit -- the first in italy after silvio berlusconi came back to power . 
  * `` in genoa , countless innocent people were subjected to physical and psychological violences that scared them for life , * recognized franco gabrielli . 
  * if still to this day , sixteen years later , it is a motive for pain , bitterness , of defiance [ toward police ] , it means that there was n't enough reflection . '' *  ** `` red zone '' **  he himself was n't in genoa during the events around the `` red zone '' that was installed , with help from barriers and significant police forces , to prevent the hundred of thousands of protesters from getting into the historical center and approaching the world 's most powerful leaders . 
  this while , following the 1999 seattle protests against the world trade organization , every alter-globalization activist , labor union , the far-left , ecologist and pacifists militants and `` black block '' autonomist made an appointment to disrupt the summit . 
   in this port city , confrontation seriously went overboard with a final count of one dead and dozens of wounded for the first day alone . 
  * `` an addition of factors '' * lead to this street battle , gabrielli analizes today , notably that the local police force that knew the terrain was kept away in favor of anti-riot units coming from all of italy and that violently repressed protesters , including the most pacifists . 
   but the first cop of the peninsula also points the inability of the `` disobedients '' ( these dozens of thousands of militants , unarmed but helmeted , that promised themselves to assault the `` red zone '' ) to handle their troops . 
  * `` in genoa , everything blew up , * regrets gabrielli . 
  * everything blew up from the beginning and that until the baneful irruption at the diaz school . '' * because during the interview with la republica , the police chief does n't settle with admitting the failure of maintaining public order during the summit . 
   ** `` butchery '' **  he goes back in details on the exactions committed in a genoa school the evening of saturday the 21st of july , almost at the end of the g8 , when elite troops assaulted the building where dozens of protesters were sleeping . 
  giving the pretext of the presence of violent militants , assuring they found molotov cocktails -- that the police actually had brought in themselves -- , the assault turned into a * `` butchery '' * , according to the confessions of one of the twenty-eight agents that would then be indicted . 
  * `` as the director of police special operation , i would have probably found myself in the diaz schoolyard '' * , notes gabrielli who * `` by luck '' * had stayed in rome to prepare for president bush 's arrival . 
  thinking that as * `` a counterweight to the devastation [ in the city ] , a significant number of arrests were needed '' * , the people in charge at the interior ministry * `` by misfortune '' * decided irruption into the diaz school , he admits today . 
   franco gabrielly goes further by talking about the abuse inflicted upon the protesters driven to the bolzaneto barrack , transformed according to him into * `` garage olimpo '' * , referencing the sinister interrogation center of the argentinian dictatorship . 
  * `` at bolzaneto , there were acts of torture '' * , says gabrielli indignantly , that goes to the length of asserting his predecessor , gianni de gennaro , should have taken responsibility and resigned . 
  * `` he did , but i declined his resignation '' * , specified in reaction claudio scajola , the interior minister at the time , who ultimately admitted as well that it was * `` undeniable that in genoa , there were some severely condemnable actions by law enforcement '' * . 
  on his side , the national secretary of the the italian left and former leader of the anti-g8 , nicola fratoianni , welcomed * `` the courageous interview of gabrielli . 
  unfortunately , we had to wait sixteen years to hear these words . '' *  * `` we are a healthy institution and we should n't fear laws and controls '' * , asserts today the current police chief , who assures that law enforcement learned its lessons from the genoa g8 within their organization , their formation , and with their relationship with citizens . 
  indicating in particular that * `` the police should n't fear identification methods within services of public order '' * . 
  just for the record , i 'd like to point out how for the past months or years every time leftists like me pointed out authoritarian drifts in countries like poland or hungary , / r/europe answered with offended `` it 's just democracy , here you go again calling people you disagree with fascists '' . 
  well there you go fascists apologists , there you go . 
  instead of claiming calling everyone fascists renders the word meaningless , learn to recognize them and that failing to do that is what actually renders the word meaningless . 
  people do n't chose to live with such anguish and complications . 
  educate yourself . 
  exactly , it 's liberal capitalism , a.k.a. 
  the global organization of poverty and wage slavery . 
  people being forced into unacceptable jobs in order to survive is a byproduct . 
  instead of considering these unacceptable jobs as normal , we should change the system that allows them . 
  henri lacordaire , a french 19th century chistian liberal ecclesiastic ( really not my political leaning ) has a famous quote that says :  between the strong and the weak , between the rich and the poor , between the lord and the slave , it is freedom which oppresses and the law which sets free . 
  honestly i started writing a much longer comment but there is n't much else to the matter . 
  there is no universal truth here . 
  the only question is what as a society or state of law we deem acceptable and unacceptable . 
  i 'm not suggesting that 's what you 're doing , but by your logic one could justify voluntary slavery . 
  that 's essentially what modern libertarians/anarcho-capitalists want . 
  we need to draw the line somewhere . 
  i return the question to you : if you do n't draw the line there , how much lower do you draw it ? 
  exploitation of poverty and potential physical and emotional damage for the carrier . 
  the day you see a millionaire woman voluntarily carry a child for minimum wage woman/couple , i 'll be happy to revisit the ethicality . 
   you chose to be a trans one does n't chose to be trans any more than they chose their sexual orientation . 
   a condition of complete self willingness such as being trasgender i have no idea what that even means . 
  care to reword ? 
  what i 'm saying is if your problem is public health care funding things you think should n't be funded , it should apply equally to cis and trans women . 
  either both get access to publicly funded womb transplant or neither . 
  as long as you tell the same thing to cis women , it 's not transphobia . 
  who the hell are you to decide if life-altering and dangerous decisions of people you obviously do n't understand is vanity or not ? 
  let professionals decide . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about and you should feel bad about it . 
  nobody talked about equality of rights . 
  having children is obviously not a right . 
  it 's about equality of access . 
  if cis women have access to publicly funded womb transplant , trans women should have access too . 
  if you refuse access on the basis that having children is n't a right , be ready to tell that to cis women and their family whose hope to have children is this publicly funded procedure . 
  do n't involve trans people . 
  so much transphobia in this thread . 
  / r/europe a beacon of progressiveness once again . 
  you support equality as long as it does n't inconvenience you . 
  typical brogressive . 
  you being stupid means my taxpayer money pays to compensate in some way , but you do n't see me crying about it . 
  there 's a reason gay conversion therapy used to be a thing and now is not . 
  you do n't fix people , you fix problems . 
  trying to `` fix '' gay or trans people has historically proven to be bad for them . 
  trying to accept them and diminish the anguish of gay or trans people has historically proven to improve their mental health . 
  if cis women have access to womb transplant and can carry children and it 's deemed safe on trans women , there is absolutely no reason to deny them access to it , bar transphobia . 
  being use to france 's gigantism , some of these parliaments make me claustrophobic . 
  is this the official / r/europe literal circlejerk thread ? 
   there 's a disturbing amount of people , even on reddit , who are convinced that murdering innocent muslims is ethically justified . 
  like all the people saying border police should shoot migrants dead to deter others when they try to cross as is a popular opinion on this very subreddit . 
  i hope you 'll moderate that going forward . 
  busy bulldozing and burning the camps these people come from . 
  at least 3 of them are right-wing / reactionaries . 
  there 's your qualification . 
  ten years too late if genuine . 
  not a puppet , just a leadership/follower relationship . 
  they have the same liberal economic agenda and merkel has been handling things for a long time now in the eu , so macron is going to assure her that he 's on her side and ready to cooperate . 
  to repeat , not a puppet taking orders from merkel , but a like-minded person assuring her he 'll follow her experienced leadership . 
  thankfully , we can have both by digging out the competent people in underrepresented categories . 
  that 's such bullshit . 
  being one and indivisible does n't mean we ignore culture . 
  of course a lot of candidates are going to be chosen because they represent their district better , and there is no competency problem here .
