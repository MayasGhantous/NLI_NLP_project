  your comment does n't warrant an in-depth answer the same way a flat-earther is n't worth debating . 
  you 're citing a conspirationist website that is cited on breitbart , the sun , various right-wing outlets , anti-islam blogs and men 's rights activist newsfeeds , endorsed by , among other unsavories i did n't look into , geert wilders . 
  that website uses the conspiracy that islamists subvert our hate speech laws to silence criticism targeted at them , as a way to push for free speech absolutism and the removal of consequences from everyone spouting hate speech . 
  you do n't understand what hate speech is , what hate speech laws are , and how they or the law in general operates . 
  that or you know exactly how it all works and embrace completely the goal to unleash hate speech free of consequences , with all the life-or-death consequences that unfurling would have . 
  either way , you 're an unsubtle tool . 
  i meant you seem to think social sciences are pseudo-sciences . 
  or that the inequalities they uncover are n't important . 
  `` give us free money or we sabotage your country '' is n't a compromise . 
  accepting that is a cynicism i refuse to give into . 
  i agree , reason for my  self-described `` left-wing '' party the socialist party 's shift from left to right has been a long and stealthy endeavor though , so most people have a blurry understanding of what being left-wing and right-wing means . 
  it 's true in france and most of world . 
  `` social sciences are pseudo-sciences '' , hmmm ... 
  i wonder who between us is the science-denier . 
  it has nothing to do with being hard , just the direction you want to go . 
  what you 're trying to say is `` despite his best attempts , reality is right-wing '' . 
  resisting to money interests is a matter of will , and like i said , he sold out . 
  either we accept politicians have a choice and he made his , or it 's time we change regime . 
  i love how plenty of people here would say those countries you list are socialists , not liberal . 
  i mean i agree with your label , but plenty would n't . 
  i wo n't give you examples of countries or experiments ( and you can find them through google ) because that would be skirting my point . 
  there are two problems here : what we mean by `` actually working '' and what about these liberal countries that are n't or have n't done so great . 
  i do n't consider the poverty rate in rich liberal countries a success . 
  i do n't consider the inequalities that persist a success . 
  i do n't consider the homeless death a success . 
  what about the usa , are n't they liberal ? 
  they are n't doing that great on many front . 
  what about pinochet 's chile ? 
  he was n't a great democrat . 
  do we conveniently deny these countries the label of `` liberal '' ? 
  point is , ideologies are n't fixed in success and failure and the historical context and moment matters . 
  macron is the embodiment of what france has been doing for 40 years and hollande for the last 5 , with the disastrous results we know . 
  the generous side of my point is that maybe he wo n't fail like everyone before and actually do good for the country . 
  the more realistic side of my point is that he 'll just be a continuation and we already know he 'll fail and make people even more miserable . 
  given that , it 's time for a new socialist push , not more liberalism . 
   implying hitler was socialist  implying failure = at least killing millions, 
  yet he had a historical possibility to change people 's lives for the best with the presidency and all chambers in the hand of a self-described `` left-wing '' party , but decided to sellout completely instead . 
  there might by a history of why the fn is so high , but he sealed it with a smile . 
  how come when it comes to socialism and communism people are prompt to point out it 's historical failures as proof they 're failed ideologies but despite failing liberalism always gets a second and third and fourth chance ? 
  you can thank fillon ~ ~ 's voters ~ ~ for that . 
  edit : actually scratch that , this is n't about blaming voters , it 's about blaming their usual political choice that made the switch appear natural . 
  meritocracy is a myth meant to ignore historical imbalances and maintain the status quo . 
  you ca n't really do fiction and isolate the burka ban problematic . 
  it 's not about women 's rights despite using it as a cover , because it 's trying to enforce a clothing police to counter another clothing police . 
  it makes women who might be victims of this pressure doubly victims by forcing them to chose between risking a fine or staying inside . 
  burka ban is a tool in the greater context of a conservative fight against a perceived `` muslim culture '' clashing against an imagined `` native culture '' . 
  it 's not so much about `` liberating women '' than it is about a show of power and control against part of the population . 
  if you want to fight against burkas , or other behaviors seen as regressive and going against equality , you can only fight actions ( fine the act of forcing someone to wear a burka , not the act of wearing a burka ) and promote education . 
  i think that 's what would have happened if people `` importing '' the burka were white . 
  it would n't have the racial oppression component it has now , and without it clouding people 's judgement we would have a more sensible approach to the problem . 
  it 's not about what you dislike , it 's about how you enforce it . 
  how do you enforce laws against islam conservatism without discriminating against people perceived as potentially muslim ? 
  if you want to fight religious conservatism , you make laws against specific actions , not people or beliefs . 
  hate speech laws are not about preventing offensiveness . 
  see my other comment . 
  laws discriminating against religion are enforced through their supposed practitioner 's appearance . 
  you not understanding the various intricacies of how racism works does n't make something is not racist . 
  islamophobia is rooted in racism . 
  people do n't wear green crescents on their vest , thankfully , any laws targeting muslims will be enforced through appearance-based discrimination . 
  you can fight against religious conservatism , as we should do against the small but loud fraction of muslims that are conservative in the eu , without being xenophobic and discriminatory . 
  you know what was meant . 
  that goes for you too / u/sausageparty2015 / u/the-great-swiss / u/cosmic _ turboanal . 
  every liberty except from freedom of though is limited . 
  fortunately , we have hate speech and incitement to violence laws in many eu countries . 
  `` will someone defend my right to shit on all muslims indiscriminately !!! '', 
  you mean how mainstream left and right parties tried to contain the far-right by having stigmatizing and discriminatory language and policies themselves and the only result is the fn being as strong as ever ? 
   over the past four decades , both the center-right republicans and center-left socialists went out of their way to try and co-opt the xenophobic rhetoric and policies of the le pens , which only emboldened -- and normalized -- both father and daughter . 
  that 's exactly it . 
  even if the fn has only ever won a few municipality , it 's xenophobic ideas have been completely normalized . 
  the worse is mainstream politicians do n't even realize it and every time it 's convenient will use the fn 's xenophobia as rallying cry against them when themselves have essentially the same discourse the rest of the time . 
  as if there was an acceptable `` republican racism '' and an unacceptable `` anti-republican racism '' . 
  she 's their product and they love how convenient she is as an opponent . 
  they 'd both adhere to what i described , the trick being that religious conservative 's definition of liberty is restricted by their interpretation of their faith . 
  it goes back to that notion of nature ** \u2122 ** . 
  for a religious conservative , being gay is n't natural ** \u2122 ** , so it is n't comprised in what liberty allows . 
  as for economics , it 's the greatest paradox of liberalism , that people tend to create rules that prevent people from screwing each others too much and keep the power struggles balanced , but that to go against that tendency and allow complete freedom of agents as per liberal dogma you would need a dictatorial state enforcing the absence of rules and absolute freedom . 
  only once have i ever saw a liberal acknowledge that . 
  never mind that in practical term , liberals ( edit : and other right-wingers ) just accept that liberty means the freedom to grab political power for their own wealth benefit and liberty to restrict others freedom to protect their wealth and political power . 
  it 's definitely an hyperbole , but that 's essentially it . 
  in the end , it goes down to a conflict of values between liberty and equality . 
  left-wingers believe liberty is important but must but limited when it prevents equality , right-wingers that equality is important but must be limited when it infringes on liberties . 
  unsurprisingly , right-wingers tend to believe in a very selfish fashion that ( almost ) everything attempting to glue us together as a society and even out our circumstantial differences is an affront to them and an infringement on their personal liberty to do ( almost ) whatever the hell they want . 
  they would n't phrase it that way i 'm sure , but if they got to the bottom of it that 's what it would be . 
  that people are naturally ** \u2122 ** unequal so restricting liberties to create a `` fake equality '' is an intolerable violence . 
   martelfirst [ i bet you would n't mind that though . 
  it 's so much easier on the right we 're the only common value to share is individualistic selfishness and any other difference does n't matter . 
  the last time communist had a candidate in france , they did 1.9 % . 
  i would support taxing emissions if carbon emission trading was forbidden . 
  it makes absolutely zero sense to turn carbon into just another commodity you can make money off . 
  instead of having companies be incentivized to reduce their emissions , they just do n't care because they make more money selling their products than it costs to buy emission rights . 
  once again , liberals manage to turn a regulation into a money-making scheme that defeats its initial purpose . 
  none of these countries had nato-backed ~ rebel groups and isis and an unstable iraq neighbor on the same ground . 
  i mean , i 'd rather assad had just flee the country \u00e0 la ben-ali , but given he chose to stay in power , it 's not like he had much other choice than civil war and the killing it entails . 
  le pen does n't give a fuck about the environment and our ecosystem . 
  egypt : moubarak gone because the army deposed him . 
  libya : gaddafi killed ( assassinated ? ), 
  in civil war . 
  assad did n't start killing syrians out of nowhere , people wanted freedom and revolted . 
  he reacted as is logical for someone to remain in power . 
  the only reason he 's still here and not gaddafi is because putin wants him there and keeps the us at arm 's length .
