  if that economic book is good , it 'll say that protectionism is just an economic option among others , not intrinsically better or worse . 
  deciding to hate it is entirely a personal decision . 
  internationalist protectionists ( which i am ) value cooperation and co-improvement of social and environmental standards . 
  additionally , one factory or industry can not be isolated . 
  maybe we can have a factory in more developed country a that produces highly technical products for their country and sell to less developed country b that produces simpler products but to the social and environmental standards of country a and this gets better access to country 's a market than country c that has lesser standards . 
  did trump discover how to fly ? 
  she 's a nationalist . 
  i 'm simply pointing out liberal ignorance , ignorance whose action produces people like her by reaction . 
  i honestly have a hard time making sense of what you 're trying to say , but what i get out of it is that you do n't seem to understand what protectionism mean and have a hate-boner for the word and idea . 
  i do , i just know my values do n't include throwing in social fragility and poverty people i valiantly defend when it comes to racial discrimination or sexual orientation . 
  all the liberalism , plus the smug satisfaction of thinking you 're a progressive . 
  or protectionists see the value in producing close to the consumers to reduce environmental impact , so having factories around the world makes sense . 
  the word you 're thinking of is nationalism , not protectionism . 
  nationalists are protectionists , protectionists are not all nationalists . 
  i do n't think people who ca n't see how it 's racist to have prejudice against people due to their country of origin , heritage , culture or religion would accept the label `` bigot '' any more than `` racist '' . 
  in their mind , they 're rational ** \u2122 ** in wanting segregated cultures and populations . 
  rational ** \u2122 ** 's are n't bigots . 
  i 'd rather call them directly what they are . 
  i refuse to let them get away with it . 
  i 'd gladly use some new label they ca n't push away though if you have ideas . 
  which is cruel and perverse , but highly rational given their goal . 
  if it was a rogue commander , assad would have probably made a spectacle of it . 
  dictators do n't get and maintain power by being stupid . 
  he said plenty of racist things , yes . 
  plenty of quotes to support it . 
  now to cut him some slack , even though recent it was less enlightened times . 
  plenty of people said racist and sexist things without actually having any hate , it was just how people talked . 
  i do n't know de gaulle enough to say how much prejudice was behind his words . 
  i do know how much prejudice holds the mayor in the article , and he is indeed a big ol' racist . 
  edit : i 'll amend my comment by saying `` it was just how people talked '' is wrong . 
  more people said casual racist things , but a lot still did n't , so de gaulle was still at the bottom of the ladder . 
  meh , `` crescent '' eluded me in the moment . 
  thanks for bringing it up . 
   non-racist people who call out racists are the reason racists ca n't circlejerk in peace . 
  people are n't pessimistic about free flows of people , there are some people who do n't like free flows of people because they perceive them as inherently a danger to them and their lifestyle , which is racist by any definition . 
  you 're the one who would like to change the definition of racism so that your prejudice escaped the stigma of the word . 
  the only reason you could find the label `` racist '' meaningless is because it 's blurry * for you * . 
  non-racist people are n't confused about what is racist or not . 
  you not liking the label does not mean it is n't very clear . 
  what the fuck is wrong with racists who thrive in this subreddit ?

  it 's more than a one dimensional question . 
  if you look at judicial stats , sure , they can be over-represented . 
  in that sense , some individuals are responsible and those who commit crime need to be punished . 
  the problem comes to pinning down this responsibility not on individuals but on their status as migrants , and associated characteristics . 
  individuals are responsible . 
  migrants are not responsible . 
  attributing these social problems to `` migrants '' as a whole is a way to refuse to think about the conditions and reasons that lead to this over-representation . 
  from there you 've got two choices . 
  either you believe a ) that people do n't want and are n't destined to be criminals so you try to defeat the factors that pushed them in that direction , or b ) you believe the causes are inherent in them because of some personal characteristic they hold or that `` their '' and `` our '' cultures are too incompatible . 
  that last belief , putting the responsibility on migrants as a social group and their differences with some perceived other `` native '' social group , is racism . 
  it 's using people of different skin color , cultural background and religion as scapegoats for these social problems , either through ignorance or hate . 
  yes , it is racism . 
  and i unsurprisingly already had you tagged as such . 
  a n t i e s t a b l i s h m e n t. 
  thank you . 
  i hate this eu . 
  i wish it cared about people more than it cares about money . 
  le pen 's vote is rooted in two things , racism and disenfranchisement-because-eu . 
  often her voters care about both , sometimes about only one . 
  part of her 2012 voter base that cared only about the eu impact and for whom her racism was n't a strong enough deterrent probably saw in m\u00e9lenchon a better solution in 2017 to tackle the eu . 
  and some people just change opinion politically . 
  yin and yang . 
  feeding off of each others happily . 
  macron is n't the opposite of her , he 's her complementary and he knows it . 
  without her , he 's nothing . 
  a candidate that implements policies that feeds her voter base . 
  anyway , if macron is the best to beat her , you 'll have no problem , no need to insult m\u00e9lenchon voters in hopes they vote against their interests to help . 
  shifting blame because you know you 're responsible for her being so high . 
  heavy on the conscience he ? 
  i know mine is clear . 
  right , as seen in all the protests where gun-bearing protesters fight off the state 's riot police . 
  as seen in the us where politicians are so scared of getting shot they 're actually secret communists . 
  pm me the address for the armed revolution and how many casualties we 're expecting , or stop with this myth that bearing firearms prevents politics from fucking us over . 
   destroy worker 's rights ? 
  neato , thank you eu , more please !, 
  come for my guns ? 
  do n't you dare you shit what are you doing !!, 
  source ? 
  nothing like a euro-liberal screeching at you to make you hate the eu . 
  and probably gave her 2 points by doing so . 
  the guy should just keep his mouth shut the remaining 15 days he 's got . 
  like i said , there are enough right-wing voters to beat her , and i include macron and of course fillon in that , so macron does n't need left-wing votes . 
  i refuse to give him legitimacy when he and who he represents actively propagates le pen ideas all year long . 
  that 's asking me to choose between pouring gasoline in my house while someone plays with matches or playing with matches myself . 
  i ca n't do it . 
  we need people who did n't participate in the farce to pick up the pieces . 
  exactly , so instead of pandering to right-wing voters , we need to offer strong left-wing choices and show them we have the better solutions to their problems . 
  you do n't do it all at once but by block . 
  harmonize france , germany , spain , italy . 
  harmonize romania , hungary , lithuania , latvia . 
  etc ... then harmonize the blocks with each others . 
  that 's why m\u00e9lenchon for example wants to stay in the eu/ez , because it can be an instrument for upward progress for all . 
  this is a democracy , i have no duty to vote for anyone . 
  if le pen is dangerous ( and i think she is ) , we ban her and her party , not shame anyone who refuses to take part in the charade . 
  there . 
  are . 
  enough . 
  right .
