  emmanuel macron : - spiritual successor to hollande and endorsed but most of a rogue ps for the first round despite promises to endorse hamon and claims they would be punished for endorsing macron . 
  - put in place the liberal policies that are degrading working conditions , wages and employment that people hope to improve through le pen 's isolationism . 
  - the same ps that legitimized the fn racist discourse with manuel valls and others stigmatizing and pointing fingers at part of our population . 
  - macron praised as a messiah by the same medias that spent years normalizing the fn , openly painting muslims as an enemy , and literally portraying m\u00e9lenchon as a would-be dictator . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon and lr : - being prime minister of france for five years and having the shit liberal policies that macron continued with the effect we know and the reason why sarkozy lost in 2012 . 
  - claiming to have the solutions despite those terrible five years as prime minister . 
  - having a position on migrants and islam probably even more racist on paper than the fn in an attempt to appeal to them and given the fn 's attempt to tone down on the visible racism . 
  - absolutely and openly corrupt . 
  - absolutely porous voter base with the fn . 
  you know what she and them have in common ? 
  they 're economically liberal . 
  that 's what france wants , and it does n't care if it comes with a racist or fascist package . 
  sure , but the hysteria does n't help . 
   to le pen and the people responsible for le pen being so high, 
  i mean , 65 % of french votes went to le pen and the people responsible for le pen being so high , i would n't say we 're particularly brilliant ourselves . 
  we 're not talking about falling for a long con \u00e0 la trump here , we 're talking about pretending like le pen is n't the fn representative and will put aside her discriminatory policies for a shot at the presidency . 
  `` more workers with fewer protections '' being code word for `` mass poor workers '' . 
  see the usa . 
  i think we have enough potential jobs and money unduly hoarded through dividends and super-wages to have more workers fairly protected and paid . 
  i refuse the cynicism . 
  i want to say nobody is that stupid , but this sub getting worked up over it kinda disproves the theory . 
  she 's not stupid enough to think she could possibly get it , stop trying to pretend it could even happen . 
   that 's an extremely dangerous move . 
  it has zero significance and impact whatsoever . 
  stop trying to frighten yourself . 
  exactly what i said , `` nothing '' . 
  people are acting like it 's some big mastermind 32d chess move when it 's just mandatory posturing as a central figure that will have zero impact on how she 's perceived compared to macron . 
  5 points , not 5 % . 
  talk about this sub getting worked up over nothing . 
  i mean , i agree , but meanwhile comments calling for migrants to be shot dead stay up , so this sub rule is n't motivated by any kind of humanism . 
   do n't laugh , but france really might destroy what remains of it 's worker 's rights this time . 
  he 's a social-liberal . 
  socialism has a meaning , and what macron wants is not it . 
  mainly , because he wants a right-wing frexit and has a discriminatory and stigmatizing attitude toward migrants and french muslims . 
  his frexit is an isolationist move instead of an opportunity for a new internationalism , and he wants to close off borders to prevent a migration and migrants he views as dangerous . 
  i 'm talking from a left-wing perspective , and of course i understand some right-wing people will argue you can hate muslims and migrants without being xenophobic because it 's just rational ** \u2122 ** . 
  i voted for m\u00e9lenchon because i want more sovereignty too . 
  there are different ways to have sovereignty . 
  dupont-aignan is for a nationalist , xenophobic sovereignty . 
  that 's a characterization that reflects his program and speeches , not an insult , although not a compliment in my mouth . 
  given his score , some people want that without the anti-republicanism of le pen . 
  as far as i can tell , dupont-aignan has the nationalism , xenophobia , and social conservatism without le pen 's fn anti-semitic background and proto-fascist tendencies . 
  he 's as much decent as the far-right can get as opposed to le pen 's trash . 
  wow another trumpbot appears with the fresh `` antifa are the real fascists '' rhetoric . 
  go back to school dummy . 
  and maybe they migrate for the same reason , but simply had a different approach to the first round thus comprised a different proportion of each candidates voters . 
  though i 'm not surprised macron supporters are only interested in numbers and are politically illiterate . 
  le pen is at this level partially because everyone from the socialist party to lr has been trying to `` address some of that voter bases concerns '' . 
  sometimes in act , at least in language . 
  even if not in power , le pen 's ideology has won . 
  we need to show it 's baseless instead of feeding it if we want to divert voters from her . 
  - m\u00e9lenchon voter goes to le pen : horseshoe !!!, 
  - macron voter goes to le pen : meh , just randoms . 
  extreme-centrism , not even once . 
  you 're a trump supporter . 
  we 've seen how draining the swamp has gone . 
  fascism is soluble in capitalism . 
  you could also argue they 're not truly left-wing voters if they vote macron despite his class-hatred . 
  there is no left-wing ballot in this second round , let 's not shame left-wing voters over it . 
  but our religious people are mostly secular , contrary to a lot of europe . 
  just your regular eu-white-nationalist . 
  this sub is made of them . 
   the propblem is that muslims have a much higher birth rate !, 
  in france it 's above 3 , if i remember correctly . 
  you get less of `` old religious people '' and get more of crazy religious people , that unlike catholics hold their religious beliefes not only as a religion , but also as a political ideology and to a degree their nationality . 
  contrary to the rest of what people post on this sub , that is totally not politically motivated . 
  less old religious people \\ \\ o /, 
  he 'll have zero problems . 
  he 's liberal and his left-wing policies are a sham . 
  he 'll cut his laws in bits to have the support of both the ps and lr mps on liberal laws and be blocked on left-wing laws . 
  exactly as planned . 
  you 're one of those `` liberals '' , are n't you ? 
  `` if i throw buzzwords around maybe some will stick ! '', 
  i hate le pen , i hate the alt-right . 
  the crif is right to fear them . 
  does n't mean they are n't far-right themselves . 
  just like isis . 
  far-rights of every religion have hate-boners for each others , they hate each other guts but feed on one another to gain popularity . 
  it 's exactly what this rabbi or the crif does , agitate fear of some other far-right to rally people to their own . 
  it 's usually centrists who claim things are not a left-wing / right-wing issue but people will just make the correct choice if they 're rational ** \u2122 ** . 
  i mean , neo-nazis believe jews control the world and need to be all killed , so for them any jewish person is an extremist . 
  i 'm just saying the crif is an association of nationalists jews that only represent the interests of israel 's far-right nationalist and theocratic state . 
  they do n't represent everyday secular jewish people . 
  the crif are jewish extremists though . 
  mainly , there should have been social and fiscal harmonization instead of competition . 
  how do you even build that pan-european identity some speak of here , and that i wish we could achieve some day , when we 're all competing against each others . 
  or maybe that 's what they mean , our pan-european identity is eternal in-fighting , depressing stuff . 
  how about this rabbi shuts up and fights against putin 's discrimination of lgbt people in russia instead of telling french jews they should flee instead of resisting a le pen presidency . 
  openly , they hate muslims , but their voter base as well as their elected officials are still deeply anti-semite but on the down-low to polish the party 's image . 
  but hamon has to do with hollande 's legacy , as much as he wants to distance himself from it . 
  `` make other people work '' , meaning if you are self-employed or boss of your own company , you can make yourself work , but you ca n't ask employees to work that day . 
  i mean , we all know depending on the business it happens and not necessarily unwillingly , but still , as an employer your employees have rights . 
  people do n't want to work on sunday . 
  they want to do other things , which they need money to do , and working sundays is a prime source of money , thus the appeal . 
  maybe we should ask ourselves if there are better ways to make people do what they want to do that does n't require them wasting countless sundays accumulating that precious money . 
  it comes down to different individual right . 
  right to work vs right to rest , and society decided a common rest day was a good thing , and takes precedence to the right to work , on sundays only . 
  posing as left-wing and having right-wing platforms is n't `` doing good '' . 
  they 're the only one surprised to lose elections . 
  there is an individual right to be paid for work , with an interdiction to make other people work on sundays in a lot of countries .
