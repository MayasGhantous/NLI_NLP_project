  i 'm saying laws decides both taxes and school teachings , and that we may disagree and try to change them but at any given moment they are what they are and we have to follow the laws . 
  in france , and i 'm wiling to bet in most of the world , economic courses at high school and university are right-wing liberal and capitalist propaganda disguised as science and left-wing economics are mostly marginalized or ignored . 
  what do you say about that kind of indoctrination ? 
  should we also not teach economics at all because it 's also matter of opinion ? 
  if you dare tell me economy is a science so it 's normal to teach right wing propaganda , what 's stopping me from saying feminists ideas are backed by scientific facts , because they are , so it should also be taught in school ? 
  no , like i said , we decide as a society what and where we teach things . 
  it has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the society we want to shape . 
  well you 're certainly entitled to your own opinion . 
  some people believe we should do away with taxes or road speed limitation , at the end of the day there are laws , we ( mostly ) follow them even if we disagree , and they change when society changes . 
  society is changing , just not in your direction . 
   real gender equality would let men talk about men 's issues . 
  not have women try to tell us what our problems are . 
  i mean , one moment feminists are sexists because their movement supposedly does n't care about men , the other they 're sexist because they talk over men . 
  you 've got to choose one and be consistent . 
  you know how plenty of anti-feminists brandish token women feminist who are satisfied with how the world works and tell mainstream feminist that their views are as valid as anyone 's and they ca n't silence them ? 
  well plenty of men talk about men 's issues from a feminist perspective , and as much as traditional men 's right activists do n't agree with them , those mras ca n't dismiss their views as irrelevant either . 
  it 's not a question of science , it 's a question of beliefs . 
  what beliefs do we as a society think we should teach our children ? 
  which should be taught by school , which should be taught by families , which should be taught by the social environment ? 
  we decided that we believed in evolution and that schools should teach that beliefs . 
  in the world , mostly , we decided that gender relations should be taught ( or more often not taught at all ) by families and social environment . 
  sweden decided that the belief that people of all genders are equal and what that entails should be promoted in school . 
  thankfully , creationist can still tell their kids that god made all things at home and at church , and swedish parents that disagree with that book can still educate their child otherwise . 
  to my original point . 
  op was saying young people understand gender equality and respect , i pointed out that it 's largely not true , and you 're confirming it . 
  feeling the need to insult someone promiscuous with a slur both gendered and stigmatizing sex workers is not a sign of understanding gender equality or respect toward other genders . 
  nor is feeling the need to trivialize and defend it . 
  edit : to be clear , his use of `` whore '' were a clear characterization , not an off-hand insult . 
  not while dating him . 
  and even if she 'd done it while dating , it would make her a cheat and liar , not a whore . 
  yesterday , an underage guy i talked to said he briefly dated a girl who dared to sleep with 3 people in 5 days and called her a whore and terrible person . 
  that 's not respect . 
  that guy is not the exception . 
  he represents a fraction large enough to fuck things up for everyone . 
  as in `` men and women are biologically different . 
  bob , do n't be a whiny bitch !, 
  suzanne , go make me a sandwich !, 
  i really ca n't believe why both of you are sad and suicidal . 
  slippery slope from what to what exactly ? 
  it 's not shaming masculinity , it 's criticizing the smallness of it 's horizon . 
  it wants to add to masculinity , not take away . 
  be a manly muscular oversexed man that internalizes his emotion or other stereotypes all you want if that 's how you are your healthy self , just do n't make it the be all and end all of masculinity and shame men that are different in any or all aspects . 
  did states also overstepped their bounds when changing school teachings from creationism to evolution ? 
  it could be considered as ideological or logical depending on your position on each matter . 
   i do n't even know what the comment is supposed to imply tsipras comment is saying , not implying , that both countries are stupidly spending billions in military on territorial feuds while they could spend the same money on real problems . 
  sometimes , diplomacy is saying publicly what everyone knows privately . 
  i imagine terrorists suspects are less inclined to contact the press to inform them of their freedom of movement being constrained . 
  especially when they are the official targets of the emergency laws , as opposed to political activists . 
  as for the climate activists , it 's officially to ensure the security of the climate conference , but it 's quite transparent that it 's actually to avoid political dissension and make the conference go as smoothly as possible . 
  everyone knows that it 's just for show , that nothing concrete is going to come out of it for the climate , so if on top of that there are massive protests denouncing the farce it might be too much of a pr disaster . 
   ~ ~ almost ~ ~ royalist . 
  ftfy, 
  that bends quite nicely for a so-called socialist when he faces corporate interests . 
  that 's what people remember , not being a basic decent person in the face of horror . 
  sure , a lot of things are free of cheap in france , but it does n't mean it 's accessible . 
  if you have free libraries in rich neighborhood but not in poorer cities or suburbs , all it does is reproduce social inequalities . 
  you not only need free or cheap culture , you need to make sure everyone has access to it , especially disadvantaged people so we can help them close the culture gap . 
  would be curious to see the spread between countries over the last 30 years . 
  you 're delusional if you think hate crimes and fascist candidates wo n't rise or that policies wo n't impact us . 
  nothing to be glad about . 
  thats my point , we did n't wait for everyone to agree to abolish slavery and we should n't have to here either . 
  but then some other countries will be pissed off about something else . 
  next year it 's going to be `` oh no we ca n't right now we need to handle the uk wanting to leave '' . 
  and the migration stuff is n't going away , war , climate change and devastated african economies are n't stopping anytime soon . 
  maybe that needs to be the next crisis . 
  maybe the eu gets to say `` sorry england , we 're gon na have to wait to examine you wanting to leave , we need to protect abortion rights right the fuck now . '', 
  it 's always `` we need to wait '' . 
  there never is a good period . 
  there 'll always be day to day things to handle . 
  they have the time to secretly negotiate trade treaties or a new constitution , they can take some to stand up for human rights . 
  i 'm sure they would be happier if polish women , at least those who can afford it , did n't have to make the trip ... 
  i really want the eu to protect abortion right and gender and sexual minorities as human rights once and for all instead of having local governments meddle with it . 
  nobody would dare to pass a law legalizing slavery even if it 's domestic , because we 've put the question in the past . 
  it could be the same for these if only the eu stood up for it . 
  it 's a true shame it takes so long . 
  are you denying the following is true ? 
  - [ oleksandre sych ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oleksandr_sych ) ( svoboda ) , ** vice prime minister ** ( 27 february 2014 -- 12 november 2014 ) - [ serhiy kvit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serhiy_kvit ) ( svoboda ) , minister of education and science ( february 27 , 2014 -- 14 april 2016 ) - [ andriy mokhnyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andriy_mokhnyk ) ( svoboda ) , minister of ecology and natural resources ( 27 february 2014 -- 12 november 2014 ) - [ ihor shvaika ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ihor_shvaika ) ( svoboda ) , minister of agrarian policy and food ( 27 february 2014 -- 12 november 2014 ) - [ ihor tenyukh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ihor_tenyukh ) ( svoboda ) ** minister of defense ** ( 27 february 2014 -- 25 march 2014 ) - [ andriy parubiy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andriy_parubiy ) ( ** founder of the [ social-national party of ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social-national_party_of_ukraine ) ** ) , ** chairman of the verkhovna rada ( 14 april 2016 - present ) ** , deputy chairman of the verkhovna rada ( 4 december 2014 -- 14 april 2016 ) , secretary of national security and defense council ( february 27 , 2014 -- august 7 , 2014 ) - [ oleh makhnitsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oleh_makhnitskyi ) ( svoboda ) , ** general prosecutor of ukraine ** - [ tetiana tchornovol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetiana_chornovol ) ( [ una-unso -- ukrainian people 's self-defence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_national_assembly_%e2%80%93_ukrainian_people%27s_self-defence ) militant ( far-right organization ) ) , member of parliament ( 27 november 2014 - present ) , ** head of ukrainian government 's national anti-corruption committee ** ( 5 march 2014 - ( resigned ) 18 august 2014 ) just so there is no confusion about [ svoboda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svoboda_\\ ( political_party \\ ) ) :  the party was founded in 1991 as the social-national party of ukraine and acts as a populist proponent of nationalism and anti-communism . 
  it is positioned on the right of the ukrainian political spectrum , particularly in the far right . 
  it is widely considered a fascist and/or anti-semitic party , while others have disputed the neo-fascist label , and simply considers it a radical nationalist party . 
  these people were mostly in power during [ arseniy yatsenyuk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arseniy_yatsenyuk ) time as prime minister , of the [ people 's front ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_front_\\ ( ukraine \\ ) ) , a right leaning party that has 81 seats in the rada making it the second party in terms of seats and member of the governing coalition . 
  fascists may only have a few seats , but your present coalition contains people that have no problem governing with fascists and appointing them to key positions . 
  maybe most were there only for a short period in 2014 , but the fact that you prime minister at the time could appoint them in the first place is frankly concerning and i 'd like for you to say it should n't have happened . 
  now maybe , being right-leaning yourself ( and i respect that , to each their own ) , you might think that it 's not that bad . 
  but at least understand that for a french socialist such as m\u00e9lenchon , the situation , having several fascists in the government ( making it not a absent-minded mistake ) , was rightfully outrageous , and that the situation is still shady with the founder of a neo-nazi party current chairman of the rada . 
  at least understand that from his point of view the situation in ukraine is dangerous and that shedding light on it is n't insulting ukraine or ukrainians . 
  not closely \u2260 not at all . 
  i read up . 
  i saw people fed up with their system wanting real change . 
  i saw maidan becoming a mess , and i say that without pointing fingers , revolutions are messy . 
  if i remember correctly , there were accusations of putin pawns inciting violence at the time , and i 'd tend to believe them . 
  i also saw the calm returning with a new government and parliament including neo-nazis . 
  a government backed by the us and the eu , who did n't care who was inside as long as it was solid enough to hold up to russian pressure . 
  now tell me neo-nazis in your government and parliament did n't happen . 
  explain to me who svoboda is if not neo-nazis . 
  you know ukrainian politics better than me , so i 'll keep an honest open ear . 
  but expect for me to check what you 're saying and call you out if you 're trying to rewrite history . 
  oh no i 'm certain maidan was a fair mix of people wanting real and legitimate change . 
  but they got their revolution confiscated by fascists . 
  you 'll find i 'm not the one painting the world black and white . 
  he denounced svoboda 's neo-nazis being associated to power with the backing of the us and the eu , in a move to prevent russian influence , and in the tradition of the us installing far-right regimes through shady methods .
