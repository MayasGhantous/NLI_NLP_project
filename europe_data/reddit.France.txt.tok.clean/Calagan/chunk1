huh , sounds fun !, 
   used a spark though a spark ? 
  like a chevrolet spark ? 
  good lord, 
  oh yeah totally , the smaller ones still have a cosier and more family friendly atmosphere . 
  alsatian was way more prevalent with our grandparents which was a language they grew up with . 
  most of the younger generation would learn standardized hochdeutsch and perhaps practice a bit their alsatian with the older generation . 
  you 're unfortunately also often bunched up with walloons and treated as such . 
  some folks in flanders can be such pig heads when it comes to customer service if they detect a french accent , pisses me right off . 
  lol monarchy, 
  we have a lot of folklore regarding imaginary beast like the fascinating [ beast of gevaudan ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%aate_du_g%c3%a9vaudan ) which killed about 100 people in the xviiith century . 
  it 's identity is still up to speculation as of this day , could be the works of a pack of wolve or a `` superwolf '' , a serial killer or an exotic animal . 
  while the beast of gevaudan is the most well known ( starring in many movies , books and documentaries ) , there is a ton of [ other cases of `` ferocious beasts '' in french folklore . ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%aate_f%c3%a9roce ) . 
  some even taking place in modern times like the [ curious case of the beast of the vosges in the late 70s ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%aate_des_vosges ) . 
  other than that , french folklore is peppered with creepy stories of elves , beasts , vampires , ghosts . 
  [ the french wiki on legendary creatures ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/portail:cr%c3%a9atures_l%c3%a9gendaires ) is actually a pretty good start to get into the subject . 
  [ there are even a few articles in english !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:french_legendary_creatures ), 
  yeah it completely lost any kind of authentic feel . 
  my idea of oktoberfest is n't really watching trashy tourists wearing dirdles made in china and pissing all over the place . 
  not my idea of fun . 
   at least we can agree the vosges kick ass , be they in lorraine or alsace  d\u00e9finitivement !, 
  haha dude do n't worry it 's only friendly banter between us . 
  most of my childhood friends come from lorraine anyway , there 's no animosity from my side . 
  there is a good amount of shit areas in alsace anyway , it 's easier to point out the ones from your neighbor . 
   yep , it 's a bit less pretty in the east that ' because you 're showing pictures of the disaster area that is lorraine you fool !, 
  it looks much better once you reach [ glorious alsace .

  yeah but i guess some have it worse than others . 
  belgium being at a crossroads of major eu roads gets atrocious amounts of traffic which does not contribute to the road quality at all . 
  plus the design of the network is n't that great either , i do n't even want to mention the ring . 
  god has left that place a long time ago , it 's hopeless . 
  i wish i had the musical talent to do that . 
  huh , not that i know of no ... 
  honestly since the past few years most supermarkets have stopped selling the small plastic bag and you pay for the larger sturdier ones . 
  i grew up in strasbourg and even i would say brussels as well . 
  thanks !, 
  also : jesus christ ... 
  hahaha what ?? 
  do you have a source ? 
  owning a [ `` pavillon '' ] ( https://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/07714cc2081b5663_6608-w500-h400-b0-p0--home-design.jpg ) in the suburbs of paris , a diesel [ peugeot 407 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/2005_peugeot_407_st_hdi_executive_sedan_%282015-07-09%29_01.jpg/1200px-2005_peugeot_407_st_hdi_executive_sedan_%282015-07-09%29_01.jpg ) or a [ renault scenic ] ( https://pictures.topspeed.com/img/crop/200607/2006-renault-scenic-8_600x0w.jpg ) , 2 kids and a golden retriever .

  buying [ your 16 pack of paniers de yoplait ] ( http://lenervee.com/images/courriers/yoplait-cerise.png ) at the [ carrefour on saturday afternoon ] ( http://images.sudouest.fr/2016/12/15/5852bc1466a4bdfd26f14648/widescreen/1000x500/l-hypermarche-devra-fermer-ses-portes-a-12h45-dimanche-la-galerie-marchande-elle-sera-ouverte-tout-l-apres-midi.jpg ) and throwing away the carboard packaging in the trash can underneath the sink ( because where else would you have a trash can ? ), 
  but keeping the plastic bags because now you have to pay for those , so let 's make a plastic bag of plastic bags that we could re-use for the trash can in the bathroom . 
  i could go on . 
  it 's uk specific . 
  it 's funny because in ireland those rhd cars are sold under the opel branding . 
  so you have lhd opels , rhd opels and rhd only vauxhalls . 
  the good thing for the uk is that they also used to get some of the unique rhd holdens from australia . 
  [ like the vauxhall monaro aka holden monaro aka pontiac gto ( lhd ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holden_monaro#vauxhall_monaro ) or the [ vxr8/maloo ] ( https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/vxl-vxr8-2014-034.jpg?itok=jgvk3fr1 ) . 
  it 's pretty weird . 
  it 's a very us flavour , i think we tend to like more `` regular '' flavours over here . 
  i like it but i guess that for the most part cookie dough is used to bake cookied and not to be eaten raw . 
  nothing says more that `` we are the baddies '' than that one . 
  pretty badass design ( in an evil way ) tbh but the bearers ... less so . 
  wtf they 're belgian ?? 
  i had no idea !, 
  romania is incredibly pristine in terms of tourist accomodation , definitely a unique experience in europe . 
  you can clearly see the cultural difference when you cross borders with germanic/northern countries where it 's totally ok to have men/woman walking around naked in some changing rooms in swimming pools . 
  i remember the first time i was stuffing my clothes in a locker and a woman in her 20s was just walking around naked . 
  i thought `` holy shit wtf is she doing naked did i just walk into the women 's changing room ?! '', 
  but then i realized that everybody around did n't react to it at all and saw it as perfectly normal . 
  [ for me this is the most dutch song i know . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0teujhfzwb4 ), 
  that 's really nice . 
  oh you crazy swabians . 
  high fructose corn syrup instead of beet or cane sugar, 
  or simply the wiki travel . 
  we got so many resources on the internet today it just seems really lazy to ask those super generic questions to / r/askeurope . 
  i like them , the flavour is usually pretty mild but they leave part of the aloe `` jelly '' in some of them . 
  a bit like the pulp in orange juice . 
   everybody drives well , everyone 's focused on his driving ( at least way more than in other cities ) . 
  i dare you to find a car parked in paris that has n't been beat to shit on all sides . 
  that 's enough of a sign to me that people in paris ca n't drive for shit . 
  * shudder *, 
  haha this is so true . 
  it 's the one thing we share with many of my italian friends . 
  east of france here , asparagus season is a gift from god . 
  oh you and your diseases-insults . 
  never fails to make me laugh . 
  the smell of root beer is often associated with a medicinal smell in europe . 
  something similar to clove or `` dentist '' / mouthwash smell hence why it is very weird for most of us . 
  i kinda like it though but i 'm an exception . 
   i was driving to verdun earlier this year . 
  well there 's your problem . 
  but with the little one is like concentrated orgasm . 
  like a welcome tiny slap in your face to wake up your mouth !, 
  you shut your whore mouth about pickles . 
  pickles are love , pickles are life and are the best for ap\u00e9ro or with raclette . 
  we like our pickles small , sour and crunchy . 
  this is probably the [ most popular brand ] ( https://www.thegoodfoodnetwork.com/wp-content/shopp/images/cache_320_320_0_100_100_16777215_maille%20cornichons%20extra%20fins.jpg ) .

  huh til , i had no idea . 
  no harm done , i had a pretty good laugh . 
  nah man , that 's gross . 
  i prefer snails anyway . 
  and `` offisme de tourisme '' instead of `` offisme de tourisme '' . 
   cocked eggs interesting , i prefer my eggs unfertilized but hey , to each their own .
