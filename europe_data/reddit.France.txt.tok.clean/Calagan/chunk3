  it is also seen as a bit weird by many . 
  i can safely say that french eat waaaaay more sushi or burgers than snails . 
  / r/travel in a nutshell . 
  really depends on the restaurant and staff in my experience . 
  haha , you have no idea how many times i had to say this . 
  [ yup , a.k.a. 
  eads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airbus_defence_and_space ) , that and bae makes up the two biggest ones in europe . 
  there 's something about watching live a big baseball , hockey or basketball game there . 
  they sure know how to manage big events like that , it 's so much fun !, 
   seems very soulless , rigid and impersonal to me . 
  it kinda is in a way . 
  every interaction is meticulously planned out which looks really bizarre for us . 
  but that is also what makes it a fascinating place . 
  it really is a culture of its own . 
  the more i think about it , the more i think i 'd like to visit the area . 
  have you been there recently ? 
  i remember the same things for school . 
  we talked a lot about african colonies , indochina and a bit over the `` events '' in algeria . 
  it was presented in a very open and progressive manner imo and was really interesting . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i might check it out sometime ... 
  that is pretty much exactly what i expect from sweden . 
  wow , where is that lake in charleroi ? 
  perfect !, 
  well , do you listen to any rap ? 
  yup , hands down europa park is one of the best . 
  you 'll have to schedule your visit according to german/french holidays though . 
  avoid weekends if you can , bank holidays at all costs and in general july/august . 
  best periods imo , is a week day in late may/early june or somewhere early/mid september . 
  the park started of as some small local park with a few knock-off disneyland rides but it grew a lot over the years , but if you arrive early enough you can rush to the end of the park and find it mostly empty . 
  the greek area is probably one of my favourites and the greek restaurant is pretty awesome . 
  the set builders did an astonishing job in that area . 
  heh , same in french . 
  oh man , nice list !, 
  here 's a few that i remember : * [ real mccoy - run away ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dx0qwhl7dc ) * [ masterboy - feel the heat of the night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iccknc9gb1e ) * [ 2 brothers on the 4th floor - never alone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7bwpkhcd_q ) * [ sash !, 
  - ecuador ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cqlvww0zko ) * [ la bouche - sweet dreams ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nk1yqianek ) * [ alice deejay - better off alone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj9we6xdvwq ) * [ ice mc - it 's a rainy day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlydql_mudi ) man , it was all so fucking cheesy ... 
   three suitcases full what the hell ? 
  some kind of bank robbery stash or is that somewhat normal ? 
  pretty cool when you 're a kid . 
  flair checks out . 
  i was deeply saddened and upset by the result of the referendum last year , but it 's true that now that the decision has been taken , the separation should be done rather sooner than later for the best interest of both the uk and the eu . 
  interesting , i had no idea !, 
  excellent list , could n't have done it better . 
  dramatically underrated . 
  wait ... was the f-35 project a partnership between british and us companies ? 
  damn . 
  you might want to crosspost this to / r/crappydesign . 
  oooh i always thought those were the same than pogs . 
  haha , yeah same here . 
  i guess it was some kind of evolution from that and/or hardstyle/jumpstyle . 
  most of the moves were about rotating your arms and touching your head . 
  it was really weird as it was really popular for a few months and then went out of style extremely fast . 
  damn son . 
  fucking awesome . 
  did you eat [ wasa ] ( https://fr.toluna.com/dpolls_images/2010/02/03/77b674d3-ef1f-49fb-a4b0-6328a88679c2_x365.png ) this morning ? 
  cheap cigarets and alcohol i guess ? 
  same , i find always super interesting when scandinavians share details about their lives . 
  we say `` pardon my latin '' , so , close enough i guess . 
  well you curse by saying name of diseases , so ... 
  nah i 've heard it too , i think it is only used in rather formal settings though . 
  in many places you see [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/flag_of_flanders.svg/1200px-flag_of_flanders.svg.png ) way more often . 
  it kinda sucks when a whole street smells like piss in the morning though ( rue de la soif in rennes ) . 
   i have heard plenty of peopme havinf fav bars to drink beer at you alright buddy ? 
  i felt like i was having a covfefe while reading this . 
  excellent question . 
  i am not sure , but looking back at a few examples growing up , i can remember that looking smart/intelligent or having a general positive attitude at school would outcast you immediately . 
  if you wanted to keep your friends you pretty much had to have that dumb contrarian attitude . 
  maybe it is somehow linked to our education ? 
  honestly , i 'm really not sure . 
  i really ca n't stand anymore this mentality of being constantly disatisfied , contrarian and negative about everything and anything . 
  the constant self-loathing might be amusing at first but really pulls the whole of the society down in the end . 
  also i 'd like to add that french military tactics were severely outclassed and outdated by the german blitz strategy . 
  the french military was getting prepared for another trench based , `` slow '' war with tanks and planes acting only as support of the infantry , whereas the wehrmacht based its strategy on tanks with the support of the luftwaffe . 
  moreover many of the french tanks were still based on technology carried over from ww1 and were rather easily defeated by the german tanks , artillery and stukas . 
  which is still insane imo , my skin would feel dry as hell if i did that . 
  to each their own i guess . 
  makes me want to plan a us road trip . 
  yup , and we also have a bank holiday on the 8th of may to celebrate `` v-day '' or the day that nazi germany capitulated . 
  what the hell . 
  that 's like spending like 1/4 of your day under the shower . 
  i ca n't believe anyone would be sweating that much . 
  luxembourg : also people buy cigarettes by the cubic meter there . 
  pretty crazy . 
  anything greasy would have a hard time coming off without soap . 
  i think bavarians in general are a bit disliked by the rest of their countrymen due to their `` extravagant '' behaviour ? 
  more like : foulez fou couchey afec moa fraulein ? 
   wurst i see what you did there . 
  nah leave geneva out , it 's pretty much the equivalent of z\u00fcrich except that people are speaking french there . 
  if you had to choose one city , i 'd go to lausanne , berne or lucerne . 
  ah yeah , forgot about that . 
  but pretty standard for many countries outside schengen/eu unfortunately . 
  what paperwork ? 
  i 'd guess it 's probably some kind of shredded emmental that we cover our pastas with . 
  yeah , that would work . 
  my personal experience , but i never had to use a physical dictionary so far and i prefer to travel rather light . 
  to each their own i guess !, 
  honestly , read as much as you can ( wiki travel is a good start ) and bring a paper guide like lonely planet with you , as it condenses everything you should know about culture , money , internet access , doctors , restaurants , etc. 
  be careful about exchange rates because austria uses euros but switzerland uses swiss francs . 
  also outlets in austria ( euro , same than in germany or france ) are different from the ones in switzerland , so make sure to have both adapters with you . 
  regarding safety , use the same principles that you 'd apply at home when you are visiting big cities .
