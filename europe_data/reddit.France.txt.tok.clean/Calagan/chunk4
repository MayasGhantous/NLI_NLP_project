  the good thing is that you are travelling to two extremely safe countries , but that does n't mean that you should n't be completely careless , as there are regular reports of laptops or phones getting stolen in trains while passengers are asleep for example . 
  additionally , strangers striking conversation with foreigners in cities are unfortunately because they ( in most cases ) want something out of you . 
  just ignore them and say no thanks and you 'll be fine . 
  if you want to meet other travelers , a good way might be through free city tours . 
  you can google `` city name + free walking tour '' and you should be able to find a few . 
  heh , i think you can do without and use google translate if really needed . 
  just learn a few words or sentences in german to be safe but i would n't bring a whole dictionary . 
  i had a good laugh as well when i saw concrete metropolis next to dublin . 
  we 're talking about dublin here , not mexico city or tokyo . 
  awwww < 3, 
  huh , that 's interesting !, 
  i 'd be curious to try that because i think for us , when you talk about ketchup it 's the `` children 's '' version that we have in mind . 
  this is not ok, 
  pickles !, 
  this is why god left us . 
  huh ? 
  what kind of ketchup do you have in poland ? 
  for me ketchup is typically heinz or amora which all contain sugar . 
  good thing is , i have many good things to say about us citizens . 
  they are . 
   like the peugeot 106 ( cheap but does n't like to stay on the road ) or the renault clio i. 
  those are almost 30 y.o. 
  today , of course they do n't hold up against modern standards . 
  honestly when they came out , they were n't bad budget cars compared to most of their competitors . 
  i 'd blame more the garbage that peugeot produced in the late 90s up to ~ 2010 like the 307s and most of the 406/407s . 
  depends what you mean by `` shittier '' , they raised it up to hold up against russian roads . 
  the body was also using much thicker steel , giving it its `` tank '' reputation . 
  [ more info from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaz-2101 ), 
  good list !, 
  i 'd just add 2 short ones : * [ coucou , tu veux voir ma bite ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inr8-xpk0yq ) hi , do you want to see my dick ? 
  from a french news segment about the dangers of online chat rooms . 
  a reporter names herself `` lolita13yo '' and gets the above mentioned message . 
  what 's cracking people up is the stupid joyful voice-over . 
  * [ meuporg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxstrfe9avu ) in a french morning show , a reporter talks about the addictive tendencies of online games like mmorpg . 
  problem is the dude has absolutely no idea what he is talking about as he pronounces it completely wrong and is even unable to properly spell it . 
  the french gaming communities had a field day with that one and produced dozens of [ remixes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwiclnljeco ) , [ ytp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa4ipkp9has ) and even got mentioned in a [ french cartoon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrf_5map9i ) . 
  lisbon seems awesome , pity that the job market and economy has still not really fully recovered . 
  [ scottish people saying real words maybe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_ungdpa4c ) never fails to make me laugh . 
  yup , [ here 's the one that is sitting on top of the gate to the presidential palace ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/grille_du_coq_detail.jpg?uselang=fr ) . 
   no way , that 's so simple !, 
  wo n't the can explode with the heat ? 
  you have to be pretty careful while making it if you do n't want that happening indeed . 
  the key is to fully submerge the can in water order to make sure that it wont overheat and only use a gentle simmer and not a full on boil . 
  last thing is to wait until the can cools down before you open it , otherwise , you might have to deal with an exploding boiling hot dairy volcano . 
  the risks are worth the price though . 
  interesting , we also have a french version of that !, 
  i remember that one , both a very touching and very sad story . 
  actually depends where in france , in the east it is a fairly popular team sport . 
  [ passed half a million licences in 2013 so i think it 's not that confidential . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/ffhb-licenci%c3%a9s.png ), 
  sure , but it might mean greater trouble if you ever go back to the country and get randomly stopped or whatever . 
  get out of here with that mayonnaise nonsense . 
  if your potatoes are properly cooked and cured with vinegar , they should give the creaminess to the salad . 
  no need to add extra fat . 
   a lot of attractions are abandoned and they have an 80ies feeling to it . 
  including the music and everything ... 
  i loved it , it gaves a very 90s fair vibe , i can totally see the appeal . 
  it 's not a show-off-y city , but it has a great atmosphere indeed . 
  it grows on you . 
  i mean , depends what you expect . 
  i expected a tiny statue of a kid peeing and i got that ( going there in the middle of the night garantees also less asian tourists ) . 
  not a 20 m statue with fountains and fireworks and shit . 
  i 've never seen the appeal of the gigantic crowds it draws , the whole thing screams `` fake '' to me . 
  give me a tiny tent , some music , a nice beer and less tourists in chinese made dirdles and lederhosen . 
   only suitable for driving fast in a straight line might have been true 15 years ago but that improved so much since then . 
  there are a few european made small trucks like the [ dacia logan pickup ] ( http://www.daciagroup.com/sites/default/files/styles/lightbox/public/galleries/pickup_noi23.jpg?itok=zte9liey ) or the [ vw amarok ] ( https://www.volkswagen-vans.co.uk/media/3071050/range_tile.png ) if you move a bit more upscale . 
  you see a bit more of the nissan navaras , mitsu l200 or the toyota pick ups though , with the very occasionnal dodge/chevy/ford pickups . 
  but those tend to be rather gigantic , expensive and gaudy so they are quite rare . 
  the lm002 is just some kind of italian made humvee , where , once the military showed no interest for it , they just said `` fuck it '' and dropped a v12 in it because why the fuck not . 
  it is closer to a prototype than a usable truck actually . 
  damn son , you 've strained far away from the light . 
  you monster !, 
  i mean , do n't get me wrong , i like carrots and cucumbers but i would n't want to get crudit\u00e9 'd by a motorbike without warning . 
  i feel you my sweaty brotha, 
  agreed for bristol , very charming city . 
  not sure if the `` refuges '' ( huts ) are open yet , but you can try parts of the famous [ gr20 in corsica ] ( http://www.le-gr20.fr/ ) . 
  oh god yes , tropical heat ( +32 \u00b0 c / 100 % humidity ) is absolutely killing me . 
  more of the cold plz !, 
  i remember travelling in a climate controlled car for 6 hours with a friend . 
  we were travelling around mexico and came to that beach town . 
  when we opened the doors of the car it felt like we were opening the door of a moist sauna . 
  i remember that we looked at each other and just laughed at the ridiculousness of the heat before we starting sweating profusely . 
  then we quickly went for a swim . 
  kro is only drinkable with amer and a slice of lemon ( picon ) . 
  hahahaha , no . 
  agreed !, 
  but you should n't be proud of it . 
  la chanson de roland is written in old french , a bit tough to understand without some explanation but it 's still french . 
  scram !, 
  you and your ^ ^ delicious southern bbqs ... :[, 
  depends if the chleus start throwing those [ awful bricks ] ( http://cdn-avatar.chefkoch.de/ck.de/fotoalben/766c8e0b089626e607ecfaaaf5e76909/23555/full_img_0606a.jpg ) at us . 
  hahaha , this is great !, 
  interesting . 
  how does it taste ? 
  often overlooked by the hordes of tourists heading straight to brugge . 
  ghent has more the feeling of an actual city , while brugge today ( while being magnificent ) is kind of fairytale land , taylor made for busloads of foreign visitors . 
  haha it 's funny how polarising natto is . 
  i had no issues eating it , but i also like my cheese extra stinky so i think that helped . 
  do n't tell them about the crumpling infrastructure and skyrocketing crime rates though .
