  also , can we keep kourou ? 
  nah we 're good . 
  that 's a vauxhall omega , so not sure if serious ? 
  i mean i like those cars but i do n't think they 're anything special . 
  that 's funny because in french , a `` l\u00e9gume '' is a very pejorative way to call someone that is in a coma or very slow/braindead . 
  haha , loved to see that squirtle evolve over time . 
   coolest police cars too wut, 
  thank you for actually expanding on that and being fact based . 
  what pisses me off even more is when you have to pay , and it still looks like 1942 stalingrad inside . 
  haha we have it in elsass as well . 
  fucken love spargeln !, 
  wtf guys, 
  i mean , sure , if you go for the cheapest twingo/clio you can find ( which is a staple for renault ) or if you look back to the 70s-90s it is a total shitshow but honestly , when i look at renault today , they have cars that are nothing to be ashamed of . 
  not really no , there are networks of school and many are outside of paris . 
  [ it is more referenced as a historical fact and was actually unofficially repealed in the early 20th century . 
  ] ( https://www.senat.fr/questions/base/2012/qseq120700692.html ), 
  heh , i mean if you enjoy eating seashells it ai n't so bad . 
  those are just `` landshells '' . 
  that does n't look that bad tbh . 
  it 's a staple from there . 
  [ toast with butter and `` hagel '' is a classic snack ] ( http://www.itsalldutchtome.com.au/images/95.jpg ) . 
  it ai n't special but it makes a pretty decent snack . 
  weird ... 
  i 've been ask tops a couple of times in strasbourg , perhaps you should walk the dog in a different neighborhood . 
  i love the diversity of landscape and people we have in france . 
  i 've spent most of my childhood just travelling around the country . 
  between brittany , normandy , paris , picardie , north , loir valley , dordogne , pays-basque , provence , cote d'azur , alpes , jura , bourgogne , champagne and alsace there is plenty of things to do and see . 
  that 's just so bizarre to me too . 
  it definitely can be , depends on the kind of caf\u00e9 you 'd go but there are some `` caf\u00e9s politique '' which kind of organises events and discussions . 
  most of the time people would keep the conversation at their table but it 's definitely a place to socialize with your friend/acquaintance and potentially meet other people if you 're feeling adventurous enough . 
  [ coupled with this for dat superfast internet access ] ( http://www.geek-vintage.com/wp-content/uploads/minitel-2.jpg ) . 
  that 's like flan or cr\u00e8me chocolat no ? 
  i think you can find something similar pretty much anywhere . 
  also linked to the terrible road conditions there . 
  this one is pretty simple . 
  am\u00e9ricain --  ricain --  cain-ri louche ( weird ) --  che-lou but then you also have strange shit happening such as : femme ( women ) --  me-feu = meuf --  feu-m, 
  that 's my personal opinion but i 'm quite adventurous when it comes to foreign candies . 
  marshmallow fluff is pretty much impossible to find here and definitely very weird for us , i do n't think many people would like it but it 'll definitely be an experience !, 
  other than that , watermelon flavoured candies , big red chewing gums , nerds , pop tarts , etc. 
  those might sounds super weird to you but as they do n't exist at all in france , it 's really interesting for the novelty of it ( at least imo ) . 
  on the more traditionnal side and if you want to bring better quality products and not just manufactured oversweetened crap , i think beef jerky would be interesting . 
  found the dutch . 
  :d i was so puzzled the first few times i saw netherlanders friends downing their fried meatballs with literally liters of milk . 
  i thought i entered the twilight zone . 
  i always rolled my eyes everytime i had to go to the uk with their stupid passport controls . 
  guess that wo n't stop anytime soon . 
  or the verlan `` cainri '' . 
  modern street french is an interesting language for sure . 
   as for wale i honestly know almost nothing aside from the fact that wales has one village with a ridiculously long name . 
  it 's so hard to chose just one . 
  it 's like chosing your favorite child . 
  my man !, 
  wow , til . 
  i had no idea !, 
   i found the location of interlaken particularly nice . 
  i can absolutely agree with that , the location is pretty incredible . 
  the town itself ? 
  not so much . 
  i 'm just trying to change a bit the circlejerk that started in / r/pics and / r/travel around interlaken . 
  it just makes me sad that tourists think that this is the best that switzerland can offer while they are just soooo many better options . 
  apologies , if i appeared a bit abrasive , this was in no way personnal . 
  okay i apologize because i 'll go on a rant here but : no , just no . 
  i 'm sorry but if you think that interlaken is the most beautiful town in eu let alone switzerland you 're simply greatly mistaken . 
  interlaken is only perceived as beautiful because of its location and because it is the main transport hub for the hordes of tourists to take a train up the bernese alps . 
  other than that it is pretty much a soulless ugly conglomerate of shops and boutiques . 
  i agree that you can find beauty in it but compared to what switzerland can offer , there 's just no contest . 
  bern , neuchatel , thun , luzern , sankt-gallen and even z\u00fcrich are objectively waaaaay prettier than interlaken , there 's not even a debate . 
  yeah and usually they just blink orange past a certain time in order to avoid having people runing reds . 
   is 24/7 common too ? 
  nope , very rare . 
  labour laws made it so to protect the workers . 
  24/7 shops would be small grocery shop in city centers . 
  for the big retail centers it would be more something like 9:00 -20:00 mo-sa . 
  does n't seem that far fetched to me . 
  haha i 've always wondered about that thing lost in the middle of nowhere as well . 
  my only `` experience '' of slough is through watching the original the office tv show . 
  am i mistaken there , should i experience the grandness of slough in person ? 
  i 'm afraid it 's going to be a bit too much for me . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's a consensus on this , but i 'd say the right would glance over the controversies more easily than the left . 
  yeah he was pretty well known for anyone with an interest in sports in general . 
  i 'd say that fourcade is more famous though . 
  true . 
  summers in alsace can be hell . 
  absolutely no air circulation so nothing but stagnant scorching air above your head for days . 
  you just spend your days in the local swimming holes praying for a storm to cool things down . 
  holy crap , that 's like a road train . 
  i thought those were only used in airports . 
  vw beetle = cox , coccinelle ( ladybug ) citro\u00ebn 2cv = deuche , deudeuche ( in french 2cv is pronounced `` deux chevaux '' , which is then shortened in `` deux-ch '' ) , sometimes 2 pattes renault 4l = trelle any very small car = tape-cul ( ass-slapper ? 
  then each specialized forum has their own name for their car . 
  the citro\u00ebn visa for instance can be called `` groin '' due to the snout looking front bumpers on the early models . 
  i tried one of those not too long ago . 
  dear god , that is just complete garbage , and i 'm pretty open to experimental beers , ugh . 
  i think he 's looking at exported wines . 
  because for sure if you 're shopping in france you can find some decent stuff around 5 $ . 
  i would have gone for pierre martin , but jean works fine as well . 
  i think i 'll start doing that . 
  the biggest car culture would probably be [ `` tuning '' ] ( http://www.gatsbyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tuningkeke_08.jpg ) , but its consisting mostly of esthetically modified econoboxes ( often done in very bad taste ) . 
  most people participating in that culture or going to meetings are seen as [ lowbrow rednecks and overall trashy ] ( https://cdn3.opnminded.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tuning-style.jpg ) . 
  folks participating in that subculture are usually called a plethora of derogatory names : jacky , g\u00e9g\u00e9 , kevin , keke , keke tuning , kakou , ... 
  there are smaller communities that gather around certain classic cars like the 2cv or the 4l but it 's not even close to what you can find in say belgium or germany .
