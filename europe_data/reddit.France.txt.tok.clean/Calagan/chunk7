  i was pretty underwhelmed by the [ `` juliette balcony '' in verona ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/11/10/article-0-15f3290e000005dc-100_634x864.jpg ) . 
  the whole area screams tourist trap , busloads of undisciplined asian tourists swarm the area and the centuries-old walls were covered with chewing gum and heartshaped graffities ( [ does this shit look romantic to you ? 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/24/bd/ac/24bdac1c631ed4e4052f8660a64f5214.jpg ) ) , making the overall experience rather ... shitty . 
  the rest of verona was awesome though so that was quickly forgiven . 
  the whole louvre is so rich that i actually forgot about mona lisa when i first visited . 
  it 's only when i saw a huge flock of noisy people around something that i realized that it was the mona lisa painting that was the center of attention . 
  i clearly remember thinking `` oh ... so that 's it ? '', 
  and moving on to admiring the rest of the treasures shown there . 
  i mean , if you go check out the manneken pis , do it like on a cold monday night and expect the worse , then it can only be better than what you thought . 
  i thought it was funny/cute the first time i saw it because i did n't have any idea what to expect . 
  it 's what i heard as well !, 
  makes me even more curious about it . 
  my guess would be scandinavian countries , france is n't that great in that regard because most if not all newspapers or private tv channels are owned by companies defending their own interests ( [ bollor\u00e9 comes to mind with the recent scandals ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bollor%c3%a9#communication_et_m.c3.a9dias ) ) . 
  sometimes we still go for a kiss on top of it . 
  come here and get your kissykiss !, 
  hugs are seen as much more invasive or intimate than `` kisses '' ( basically putting one cheek against the cheek of the other person ) in france . 
  you can imagine our reaction when we first went to the us as exchange students and everybody was hugging each other when we said goodbye . 
  we were like `` wtf is happening ? 
  did someone die ? 
  i 've always been curious about candy corn , but i guess that 's just me . 
  never seen those in the eu and would be interested to just try them ... 
  what on earth ... 
  and here 's how it 's [ supposed to look ] ( http://www.japanesecooking101.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/img_8970.jpg ) , traditionally decorated with mushrooms made out of meringue and the [ occasionnal leprechaun or a tiny plastic axe ] ( http://i2.cdscdn.com/pdt2/3/6/4/1/700x700/auc2009958587364/rw/lot-de-17-sujets-decoration-buche-noel.jpg ) . 
  i can imagine that some wars started for less than that . 
  oooh that was great , thanks for sharing !, 
  i mean , at least it 's pretty clear what his point is . 
  adding a random '' - en '' every now and then as well . 
  very well summarized !, 
  funny because i mostly see them driving like complete lunatics ( way over the speed limit and rather aggressive ) , especially in france when they need to get the sun that they desperately need . 
  thank you for your service . 
  o7 o7 o7, 
  i guess english as well ? 
  definitely not german though ... 
  wow , first time i 'm seeing this . 
  still there are so many of them !, 
  fricandelle , mitraillette ( is it still a snack tho ? ), 
  or brochettes immediately come to mind . 
  living the dream !, 
  i think paris would come in the top three as well . 
  ca n't walk 5 min in tourist areas without getting harassed . 
   ants on a log ( peanut butter and raisins on celery ) what the hell ... [ croque-monsieur ] ( http://img.cac.pmdstatic.net/fit/http.3a.2f.2fwww.2ecuisineactuelle.2efr.2fvar.2fcui.2fstorage.2fimages.2frecettes-de-cuisine.2frecettes-pour-tous.2fenfant.2fcroque-monsieur-9768.2f121747-10-fre-fr.2fcroque-monsieur.2ejpg/1200x600/crop-from/center/croque-monsieur.jpg ) ( kind of what you call grilled cheese sandwich , except with emmental and jambon blanc ) is quite a popular snack here . 
  it 's in the same vein than / r/t _ d , starts off as parody but many ` muricans take it at heart and transform it into a cesspool of assumed poor quality circlejerk . 
   also , if the eu would pick one , why would it be spanish ? 
  i do n't see this happening anytime soon as well . 
  english is a world language and possibly the most common amongst europeans , i ca n't possibly imagine anyone wanting to switch it to spanish , french or german . 
  haha i know !, 
  but they had this quintessential british ... quirkiness about them ? 
  even though most of them were complete rubbish , i still think that there 's [ something about them ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/5a/34/9b/5a349b7f3dd4a38e9d1bc4fd91c6b56f.jpg ) . 
  i mean , france carmakers came up with some really [ weird shit in the 60s ] ( http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/michelin/ami/ami-6/images/ami6-5.jpg ) up [ to the 80s ] ( http://img7.hostingpics.net/pics/946055imgp7421.jpg ) , and it 's pretty much a miracle that citro\u00ebn is alive today , i just wish we had the same with bl cars you know ? 
   porcupine tree it 's a shame that you 'll probably wo n't be able to experience them live , because my goodness , they were exceptionnal !, 
  aw hell naw , not this shit again ... ^ ^ scheisse, 
  what a wonderful thing . 
  italian detected !, 
  it 's a shame that the uk lost most if not all of their entry level passenger vehicles brands . 
  i 'd love to live in a world where british leyland would still exist ... :(, 
  which is pretty much vw . 
  i can not honestly call croatia underrated as it is completely overrun by tourists in the summer . 
  this has been the case for at least 10 years now . 
  romania for instance is underrated . 
  i do n't think so . 
  we do get some weird shit posted here sometimes ... 
   whilst we 're on the topic , how well known is admiral nelson in france . 
  only by history geeks i 'd say . 
  perhaps a quick mention in school since trafalgar is part of the decisive battles lost by napoleon ( just like waterloo later on ) . 
  well that would be the second word . 
  first one would be either `` a\u00efe ! '', 
  or `` ouille !, 
  they are !, 
  if you have the opportunity definitely take it . 
  while there are some wonderful villages and towns all over france , do n't be mistaken we do still have some pretty shitty places too . 
  to name a few : * [ maubeuge ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nord-pas-de-calais/sites/regions_france3/files/styles/top_big/public/assets/images/2015/06/02/maubeuge_2_1.jpg?itok=lplamaj7 ) : severely damaged during wwii and hastily rebuilt only to be badly hit by recession in the 80s . 
  not too far away from charleroi which is hands down one of the ugliest places in the world . 
  * [ le havre ] ( http://avidcruiser.avidtravelmediai.netdna-cdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/le_havre_paris-10.jpg ) : port and industrial city , badly damaged during wwii as well . 
  * then you have those countless ghettos built in the 60s , right outside the biggest cities . 
  like [ montreynaud ] ( http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/067/955/143_001.jpg ) , [ sarcelles ] ( http://www.sarcelles.fr/images/5-famille-et-solidarite/5.8-demarches-logement/d.9_demarches_logement.jpg ) or the north of marseille : [ marseille quartier nord ] ( http://storage.canalblog.com/23/99/1032934/89354694_o.png ) . 
  * [ saint-etienne ] ( http://www.maximejegat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/sainte.jpg ) : and the countless other small towns surrounding it which are on life support since the mining activities stopped . 
  uk has some wonderful things to offer !, 
  sure , if you 're stuck in slough you might think that but i mean , london , york , dorset , kent , the countryside in wales , bristol , edinburgh , countryside of scotland , etc. 
  it 's pretty gorgeous !, 
  i think it 's garbage here . 
  from my experience dealership garages are doing some intense price gouging and the level of incompetency is off the charts . 
  it is hard to find a mechanic you can actually trust . 
  i remember that they wanted to bill me 350 $ for changing a switch ; one trip to the junkyard and 20 min later only using a screwdriver , i had it done for 20 $ . 
  never again . 
  well summarized . 
  i 'd like to see him try though , because holy shit what a miserable experience it would be . 
  really ? 
  have n't noticed it so far ... 
  that 's a weird one ... 
  french here . 
  totally true . 
  14th of july is a national holiday because it 's warm enough for our whole nation go to their local creek or lake and take their yearly bath . 
  yeah , usually it 's us who get that one . 
  i mean , one shower a day , you guys are insane . 
   belgium on the other hand ... 
  it really is n't so bad !, 
  there are dedicated cycling lanes all over the country . 
  i mean , obviously part of the highway system is complete shit ( hello potholes ) , but it is still lit up in the night all over the country , which is great and trains , while are often late and needs refreshing , are well connected and rather cheap . 
  really , it 's not so bad !, 
  all depends who she will be facing in the second round .
