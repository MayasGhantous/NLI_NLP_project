french socialist party has nothing in common with podemos . 
  ps members are not proponents of socialism or any marxist theory ( or any `` radical '' or `` anti-liberal '' leftist ideology ) . 
  the party has `` socialist '' in its name but it is just an heritage from the past , the party is social-democrat/social-liberal , similar to the psoe in spain or spd in germany . 
  french equivalent of podemos would probably be the parti de gauche , or nouvelle donne to some extent . 
  what 's the point of showing us a 10-year-old video of hollande using the most common rude word in french ? 
  that 's not news , that 's not funny , that 's not relevant . 
  and if you want to make fun of hollande there are a lot of better and more recent videos !, 
  in french * ch\u00e2teau * is used for a wide variety of buildings , ranging from huge fortresses built for defense to magnificent palaces . 
  * ch\u00e2teau * is usually translated '' * castle * '' , but apparently * castle * is only used to describe the defensive buildings in english . 
  for instance in french it 's `` ch\u00e2teau de versailles '' while in english it 's `` palace of versailles '' . 
  * palace * and * palais * also exist in french , * palace * is generally used for luxury hotels , and * palais * for ch\u00e2teaux-like buildings located inside a city ( palais du louvre , palais des tuileries , palais de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e ) . 
  the fn is not a fascist party . 
   the big deal is that the senate is n't pink ( = socialist ) anymore , which means that hollande presidency just got a lot more complicated , as this situation where the lower chamber 's majority is socialist and the higher chamber is ump means that passing new legislations and reforms will be harder . 
  not that much . 
  the senate is pretty much useless ( except for constitutional laws ) , the national assembly always has the last word . 
  it will just take more time to pass a law . 
  previous socialist govts did n't have a majority in the senate either and it did n't stop them to pass laws . 
  ( and the current socialist majority in the senate was very short and hollande already had trouble convincing them to vote his laws ) . 
  no , for every country the names seem to be displayed in the local language . 
  nathan is the same in french , but has n't the same pronunciation as english . 
  it 's an old name from the bible but it became popular very recently , never seen a grown man named nathan in france . 
  i 've never seen a `` ellen '' and i think the map is wrong because it should be emma . 
  also i do n't understand why french parents would use `` ellen '' rather than the french `` h\u00e9l\u00e8ne '' . 
  in both case h\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a dated name , not very popular with babies i guess . 
  nah man , it 's clear that orban will win . 
  well , ellen is not a french name , so we try to pronounce it like the english pronunciation . 
  actually , it 's generally pronounced `` h\u00e9l\u00e8ne '' , which is not the exact english prononciation . 
  no , like h\u00e9l\u00e8ne , something like `` elle aine '' . 
  ( but it 's not the most popular name , the map is wrong , the most popular name is `` emma '' . 
  do you speak french ? 
  if yes , nathan is pronounced like `` n'attends '' . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://fr.forvo.com/word/nathan/ ) you can listen to a frenchman pronouncing nathan ( below english and german pronunciation ) . 
  not really . 
  anti-clerical policies started with the revolution and the first republic . 
  napoleon , restauration kings and napoleon iii did not oppose the church . 
  true institutional separation started in 1880s , but the true act of separation is the law of 1905 . 
  what are your sources ? 
  nathan is indeed becoming very popular but i 've never seen a girl named ellen , and all the websites i checked say it 's emma . 
  jupp\u00e9 has serious chances . 
  if the right primary elections happen and include centrist partys then jupp\u00e9 can beat sarkozy . 
  he has a more moderate and less divisive profile and attract many people who are tired of sarkozy 's bullshit . 
  in france that would be unthinkable , there 's a very strict separation of the state and churches . 
  yeah , pre-hausmann paris was like this , not the current one . 
  `` brittany is like a fist in the atlantic ocean '', 
  `` i 'm all lost in the supermarket i can no longer shop happily '', 
  sincere question , can you explain what is wrong in my sentence ? 
  yeah , the average french would have say something like boeuf bourguignon , blanquette de veau or magret . 
  yeah , but herg\u00e9 was belgian , so estonia would have to thank belgium for szut , not france . 
  france also have a [ senate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg_palace#mediaviewer/file:palais_luxembourg_sunset_edit.jpg ) ( upper house of the parliament ) . 
  `` i 'm surprised you see them so often if you ignore us like you said '' you publish articles , we see them . 
  when i said we mainly ignore it 's ignore in the sense `` hey , i do n't listen to you haha ! . '', 
  but the idea that we do n't publish these kind of articles towards you and we are mainly focus on germany . 
  where they really in the same tone of the ones you can read in the the ft or the times ( nyt and newsweek also publish articles like this ) ? 
  they mainly consist in french bashing and are full of clich\u00e9s , french words , misinformations , stupid statements and centered around paris . 
  these articles are so similar and shitty that the french version of slate publish a `` bingo '' of their most common features ( http://www.slate.fr/france/81945/bingo-mauvais-articles-americains-sur-france-newsweek ) , among them : `` false figure '' , `` the theme of the article is our sadness or depression '' , `` consider the situation in paris to be the one of the whole country '' , `` cigarette '' , `` only ask rich people '' , `` full of french words : `` joie de vivre '' , `` malaise '' , `` tristesse '' ... we see those kind of articles regularly , and i 'd be surprised to find similar french articles towards uk . 
  yeah , a running joke for english , but not for french . 
  we joke about belgian , but very rarely about english . 
  you wo n't see a french making a fart machine which aims uk , 
  ** france ** * ** least favorite neighbor ** least favorite neighbor ? 
  we never heard about switzerland or luxembourg , barely talk about spain , italy or belgium . 
  the least favourite , though it 's not a staunch hate , would probably be the ** uk ** . 
  you 'd probably think of the french-english rivalry but today i think the whole `` english-french hate-love relation '' is mostly an english thing . 
  uk medias regularly publish shitty articles full of clich\u00e9s and incorrect facts saying how france is depressed or declining , french media mock these articles and list their clich\u00e9s or misinformations , but do n't publish the same type of articles towards uk . 
  similarly you can see lots of english people making joke on the french ( including this subreddit , you always find `` yeah we beat the french !, 
  rule britannia !, 
  '' - like comments ) , but french do n't make joke about english or are delighted every time we beat them at something . 
  sure , we joke about belgians and wish to beat the germans at least in one domain , but the english ? 
  we just do n't show much attention towards them . 
  french generally have good opinion on neighboring countries . 
  but the uk is seen as more and more distant country , sabotaging eu and too economically liberal . 
  we do n't hate them , actually we mainly ignore them , but do n't really understand them and dislike their attitude and policy toward france and the eu , so they are probably our least favorite neighbor . 
  * ** favorite neighbor ** no doubt here : ** germany ** !, 
  since the end of ww2 france and germany became very close partners , we 've build a good relationship over the years and french medias often talk of the `` couple franco-allemand '' ( franco-german couple ) . 
  they are our closest partner and we try to work together for our common interest . 
  relations between merkel and sarkozy and hollande were not as good as the one between former leaders , but germany still remains our closest friend . 
  polls show we consider them the people who resemble us the most and that french are happy to build a common future with germans . 
  in france , germany is often showed as an economic model and we are very happy when we do something as good as they do . 
  it 's like we want to impress them . 
  we 'd like to be more listened to by the germans ( and want them to slow austerity measures ) but i 've no doubt they will remain our favorite neighbor . 
  the third theory is perhaps the most beautiful but i think it 's incorrect . 
  all my university professors i asked told me the idea of `` sang bleu '' ( noble blood ) did not exist at that time and that it 's very unlikely `` impure blood '' designated the citizens . 
  rouget de lisle was n't a philosopher nor a great poet , he just wanted lyrics that could motivate his troops , it 's more plausible that `` impure blood '' designate the ennemies of the revolution . 
  last time i went to toulouse i saw a bar called the `` nothing toulouse '', 
  in the french case i believe they took months to find the plane and the bodies . 
  but yeah , the circumstances are very different , especially the `` attack '' part , the psychological impact is n't the same . 
  i 'm surprised by the enormous reaction the crash has caused in netherlands ( mourning day , people attending ceremonies , medias describing it as one the worst event in the modern history of the country , etc. ) . 
  in comparison , the air france flight with 228 passengers that crashed in the ocean a few years ago had a quite a moderate coverage in france . 
  medias largely focused on the causes and people responsible for the crash ( who was to blame : pilots ? 
  air france ? 
  etc. ), 
  but there was n't all this `` sentimental treatment '' depicting it as a national tragedy , or the whole country showing empathy for the victims . 
  i guess it 's due to the circumstances : a missile targeting innocents vs an accident ( which is far more common and far less avoidable ) . 
  `` rire dans sa barbe '' is just to laugh discreetly , it has nothing to do with remembering something from the past . 
  does n't change anything to the fact that in politics the term * radical * refers to a centrist/liberal political ideology . 
  the problem is that you seem to believe that * radical * is used in the unpolitical common sense of the word : `` favoring fundamental change , or change at the root cause of a matter . '', 
  but it 's not , here radical refers to a political ideology that used to be indeed radical in the 19th century ( because it opposed monarchist and conservatives ) but gradually became centrist as socialism developed to its left , the main example being the radical party in france . 
  here 's the definition from wikipedia : `` the term radical ( from the latin radix meaning root ) was used during the late 18th century for proponents of the radical movement . 
  historically , it began in the united kingdom with political support for a `` radical reform '' of the electoral system to widen the franchise . 
  some radicals sought republicanism , abolition of titles , redistribution of property and freedom of the press . 
  initially identifying itself as a far left party opposed to the right-wing parties ; the orl\u00e9anists , the legitimists and the bonapartists in france in the nineteenth century , the republican , radical and radical\u2010socialist party progressively became the most important party of the third republic ( 1871 -- 1940 ) .
