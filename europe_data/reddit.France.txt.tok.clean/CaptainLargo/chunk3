  after the event of may 1968 the university was split , and today the historical building is split between 4 universities . 
  also , 3 universities have taken the name : paris i panth\u00e9on-sorbonne , paris 3 sorbonne nouvelle , and paris-sorbonne ( paris iv ) . 
  they have rooms in the historical sorbonne building but also in far less nice parts of paris ( tolbiac in the xiiith for paris 1 , clignancourt in the xviiith for paris iv ) . 
  generally speaking when people say they are the sorbonne they talk of paris i or paris iv . 
  now , even if is the name is cool you have to understand that those universities are supposed to be like every other public universities in france and hence do not practice selection ( at least at the bachelor level , it 's more complicated with master 's degrees ) . 
  but yeah they have some very demanded masters degrees and perform well in research rankings . 
  but anyway , the most prestigious places are certainly the best grandes \u00c9coles : ens , hec , x , ena . 
  for me , ens is the most prestigious ( and clearly the most difficult to get in ) . 
  in france doing a phd does not obligatory earn you a salary . 
  there are different remunerations and scholarships but they are not available to all students , it 's very common in social sciences to have no financial help from university and the state . 
  while service is indeed included in the price , i would n't be as radical as saying that `` you should never tip '' in france . 
  tipping is actually quite frequent if the waiter was not an ass . 
  for a drink it would only be cents , and never more than a few euros for restaurants ( like 1 $ or 2 $ for a decent waiter , perhaps more is the service is excellent , but it 's rare ) . 
  yes , i 've made a few mistakes , my bad . 
  please note numbers are for january to the end of may . 
  yes numbers are from january to the end of may , even with the map ( do n't know why i put `` so far '' , it 's incorrect ) . 
  i guess they could n't find more recent numbers ? 
  no idea for the 6 % of rejected syrians , perhaps some countries have very strict criteria ?

  since it 's a complex topic i just want to give a few informations for people to understand gypsies ' situation in france . 
  roma and its french equivalent * `` rom '' * have been chosen by some international organization to define all tsiganes in europe . 
  but in practice , in france , '' * roms * '' is only used to refer to the romas of eastern europe ( who have just been present in france for a few years and number around 20-30k ) and is a relatively recent term in general news ( most eastern romas came when romania and bulgaria joined the eu ) . 
  the french gypsies , ( who are far more numerous than eastern european romas in france ) and have been french for centuries are called * gitans * or * manouches * and really do n't want to be considered romas . 
  technically speaking , * gitans * refer to the ones of southwestern france that have ties with spain ( they generally speak spanish , catalan , french or kalo ) while * manouches * ( or sinti ) are present in other parts of france and also in germany and italy . 
  ( there may also be more subgroups , i 'm no expert ) . 
  now , generally speaking , people will just refer to all french gypsies as ** `` gitans '' ** or by the administrative term ** `` gens du voyage '' ** ( travelers people ) , though the latter term is not the most accurate since there are sedentary gypsies ( big communities of sedentary gitans in montpellier and marseille for instance ) and traveling people that are not gypsies . 
  in this instance , the people involved are french romas , probably manouches . 
  french gypsies are french but often live secluded from other other french people . 
  they have troubles with schooling and live in a rather patriarchal society . 
  gypsies lack official spokesperson and representative organizations and tend to show little respect for some laws . 
  on the other hand , politicians have also shown some reluctance to accept their way of life ( especially concerning the mandatory space to accommodate travelling people every city must build ) and to give them full citizenship ( not long ago they had no id card but a specific travelling book some considered to be an id for second-class citizens ) . 
  though there are some accidents including gun violence or clash with authorities regarding the place they want to stay at , i 'd say that , generally speaking , the coexistence is generally pacific . 
  i 've never had any problem with gypsies personally and had met some very nice ones that managed fun fairs , but i know i could never really integrate their group of become really close to a gipsy . 
  yeah i totally misread the article , it says that 9 % of world millionnaires are french , it 's totally different , sorry :(, 
  us dollars ( and that was in 2010 ), 
  according to a [ study ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/impots/2010/10/11/05003-20101011artfig00375-plus-de-deux-millions-de-millionnaires-vivent-en-france.php ) , ~ ~ 9 % of french inhabitants ( 2,2 m ) are millionaires ~ ~ 2,2 m french people are millionnaires ( 9 % of the millionnaires in the world are french ) , mainly because of residence values i suppose . 
  we are ranked as the third country with the most millionaires ( after the us and japan ) . 
  `` a french citizen who also tackled the suspected jihadist but who wishes to remain anonymous will receive the honour at a later date , as will a franco-american passenger who was hit by a bullet and is recovering in hospital '', 
  i 'm not pushing an agenda , i just want to give facts about a regional language that is apparently not well known outside of alsace . 
  if by all age groups you mean 50 + people , and by bas-rhin you mean only the most distant areas , yeah , you 're right . 
  `` 43 % of the adult population , and 3 % of those 3 -- 17 years old , stated in 2012 that they speak alsatian '' [ edit : an insee document ( a far more reliable source ) talks about 39 % of speakers with their study of 1999 as a source , so 15 years later the number is probably way lower ) ] it says everything . 
  alsatian is spoken by a minority of the population ( and we all know that this king of surveys always overestimate the number of speakers because people themselves overestimate their ability to really master the language and not just understand a few sentences . ), 
  and we do n't even know if those people actually use it in their lives . 
  alsatian is almost never written , so it would be hard to see it . 
  and young generations massively do n't use alsatian , at most they may understand it . 
  it 's really only used by elder people . 
  actually i 've always seen the same thing : grandparents speak it and often use it in their casual conversations , their children understand it but never use it themselves and often respond to their parents in french , and the grandchildren do n't understand it . 
  hell , i even know the son of the lady who does the news in alsatian on the local news and himself can not speak alsatian . 
  100 % of alsatians speak french , absolutely everything is in french , there 's not even bilingual stuffs ( like there in some part of britanny ) except for street names in some cities . 
  alsatian is just a dying oral dialect spoken mainly by elder people in tiny villages . 
  stop showing alsace as german-speaking , we speak french here :(, 
  i do n't know if france is an exception but here net salary means gross salary minus social contributions ( * cotisations salariales * ) , it does not include income tax ( or any other taxes actually ) or utilities expenses . 
  de gaulle was only hated by a part of the population . 
  when he organized legislative election during may 1968 crisis he won by a landslide , even bigger than his previous results . 
  he left power in april 1969 after he lost a referendum , but still managed to get 47,5 percent in favor of his referendum , not that bad . 
  yes for me francophone belgium is clearly the country that resemble the most france !, 
  same language , lots of belgian artists popular in france ( beno\u00eft poelvorde , stromae , c\u00e9cile de france , etc. 
  ) , we even have lots of belgians in our tv show ( every reality show has at least one belgian ! ), 
  even the 60 % is not right . 
  the d\u00e9put\u00e9 based his numbers on the works of a sociologist but he did n't look at them carefully since they only concerned specific areas . 
  when le monde asked this same sociologist he told them the real number for france is actually 50 % . 
  yes , the only credible source i 've found is [ this sociologist ] ( http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/10/24/les-etranges-calculs-d-un-depute-ump-sur-l-islamisation-dans-les-prisons_4511981_4355770.html ) that says it 's 50 % ( but it 's up to 80 % in certains prisons ), 
  the telegraph does n't give sources and i doubt their numbers are true . 
  a report by a rightwing d\u00e9put\u00e9 mentioned 60 % based on the works of a sociologist , but le monde interviewed this same islam sociologist and he told them the numbers were actually closer to 50 % . 
  still largely overrepresented though ...

  yes you 're right , my main point is that social conditions play a large role in criminality and blaming only religion is quite a limited analysis since numbers vary so largely between france and the uk . 
  read the article . 
  it says that muslims account for 8 % of the general population and 70 % of the prison population in france while in england and wales they account for 5 % of the general population and 14 % of the prison population . 
  that means that in english prisons , muslims are overrepresented by a factor of 2,8 while in france they are overrepresented by a factor of 8,75 . 
  so i 'm quite sure religion is n't the only thing to blame , and that we should look more closely on how the way muslims are treated and lived in france is likely to produce more criminals than the way they are treated in the uk . 
  ( edit : and also why non-muslims are more likely to become criminals in the uk , my point is that we should take into considerations social conditions ) .

  still largely overrepresented though ... 
  yeah i just do n't understand where those numbers come from , it just does n't correspond to anything generally used in france . 
  8.8 % of france inhabitants are immigrants ( 5.5 % immigrants from outside of europe ) . 
  less than 6 % are foreigners . 
  immigrants and theirs children make up 19 % of the population . 
  but that would be a very strange way to define who is french and who is n't since ethnicity is never mentioned in france and would be hard to clearly delimit ( are you french if one of your parent is or do you need both to be ? ) . 
  a man like sarkozy should n't be considered french because his father is hungarian ? 
  oh , you are too good with us my lord . 
  that 's already partly the case , tall buildings are now authorized on the fringe of some arrondissements that are far from the historic center , like the 18th , the 13th , the 15th ... and they are also legal out of paris ( paris region is more than 10million inhabitants but the city itself only has a population of 2,2 m ) .

   we are the only country that has 2 aircraft carriers in europe ... yeah but those are filthy s/votl aircraft carriers ( just like the ones the rosbeefs use ) , nothling like the catobar master race of the * charles de gaulle *, 
  yes far left did poorly in 2012 . 
  i wonder what will happen to everything left of the ps in 2017 : the communists lack leadership and hate the left party , m\u00e9lenchon has lost his momentum and his party is nothing without him , and the far left is nowhere to be seen . 
  if m\u00e9lenchon stays low in polls and hollande avoids an ecologist candidature he could perhaps get to the second round ... 
  it 's more than that , the fn is not fascist because it simply does n't promotes fascist ideas . 
  fascism is a largely misused term nowadays but if you look at the core concepts of this ideology ( the role of the leader , corporatism , the hate for democracy , etc. ), 
  you 'll see these are not present in fn official ideology ( though you might probably find closeted fascists in the fn ) . 
   parti de gauche ( the left party ) : evolved from the old communist party , no , they come from the left wing of the ps . 
  m\u00e9lenchon was even a minister in a socialist government . 
   they regroup most of what 's called the `` far left '' the left party is generally considered by scholars to be antiliberal left or radical left . 
  fat left ( extr\u00eame-gauche ) is used for parties to the left of the communists ( i.e. 
  trostkysits and leninists from lo and the npa )  center party : ideologically mainstream , basically a middle ground between the socialists and the right wing . 
  depending on the times , in general they lean more to the center right . 
  they 're more for the free market , while being socially more progressive .
