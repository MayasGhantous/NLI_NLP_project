  apr\u00e8s la victoire du candidat socialiste , jacques fauvet \u00e9crit dans le num\u00e9ro du 11 mai 1981 : `` cette victoire c'est enfin celle du respect sur le d\u00e9dain , du r\u00e9alisme sur l'illusion , de la franchise sur l'artifice , bref , celle d'une certaine morale . 
   le monde is considered the most authoritative newspaper , it used to be pretty neutral but it has become distinctly left of centre over the last years . 
  no le monde was actually more politicized in the past . 
  though always a reputed newspaper it started as a left-wing newspaper that generally supported the socialists . 
  in the 90s the newspaper moved to the center and was said to support balladur ( center-right ) . 
  now it 's unclear , the newspaper certainly does not support the right but is quite critical of the left , especially on the economic issues . 
  so yes le monde leans to the center-left , but it is not something new . 
  the only sociologist to have ever worked on the subject , farhad khosrokhavar , stated in * [ le monde ] ( http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/10/24/les-etranges-calculs-d-un-depute-ump-sur-l-islamisation-dans-les-prisons_4511981_4355770.html ) * that the number was closer to 50 % . 
  actually the 60 % figure your article uses is an incorrect figure a mp took out of context from his work . 
  he later explained that the number was frequently above 50 % , even going as high as 80 % in some prisons that are close to big urban areas , ** but that the average number in france is in the 50 % range ** ( which is still very disproportionate ) . 
  the only sociologist to have ever worked on the subject stated in * le monde * that the number was closer to 50 % . 
  never heard someone use `` zezette '' to refer to a white trash . 
  a population can grow even with a fertility rate under 2 . 
  he was n't sued because he implied sarkozy was jewish but for anti-semitism because he implied that sarkozy 's son would convert to judaism to get social ( business ) success . 
  ethnic french is a dubious term . 
  there are millions of french that are of italian , spanish , belgian , polish , portuguese and they are considered perfectly french though they are have not `` their roots '' in france ( and i 'm not even talking about the millions of arabs , african and asian that are , for the most , well integrated ) . 
  is sarkozy not an ethnic french ? 
  that would be silly . 
  terrorists from brussels and strasbourg ? 
  clearly european parliaments are incubators of terrorism . 
  it 's generally considered to be far-right . 
  i did n't say there were n't muslims in seine-st-denis , i just say they were n't the majority . 
  besides , i gave the results of the muslim parties just because i thought it was a useful information : we can see that the muslims are still largely voting for ps ( or fdg ) , will it last ? 
  no it 's not . 
  and there was a muslim party that presented a list in the regional elections , it got 2 % of the votes in seine-st-denis . 
  a lots of immigrants and people of immigrant descent live in the paris region ( ile-de-france ) and are not highly skilled , and yet the fn vote is low . 
  seine-st-denis is ridden with unemployment and lack of qualified youth and yet the fn is far from having a high score there . 
  ile-de-france is by the region with the most immigrants and yet the fn vote is the lowest . 
  actually it 's hard to have a definitive explanation of the fn vote : the fn vote is high in regions with high proportion of immigrants as well as region with only few immigrants . 
  generally speaking brittany is left-leaning , it 's actually the region where the socialists got their best score . 
  there 's also a regionalist party that got 9 % of the votes . 
  it 's also the region that voted the less for the fn . 
  bnp and fn are also very different parties . 
  seriously , people on this sub tend to think that fn is a fascist party . 
  it 's a far-right nationalist party but does n't have this whole white only/skinhead culture of the bnp . 
  calling marseille a `` socialist stronghold '' seems wrong to me : they have a rightwing mayor ( and it 's been the case for 20 years ) and in the last european elections the fn was first with 30 % , ump second with 25 % and ps third with 12 % ( + other leftwing parties : greens 8 % , left front 8 % , nouvelle donne 2 % ; centrists-right udi/modem 5 % ) . 
  it 's true that hollande won in the city in 2012 , but only by a slight margin . 
  and since then i 'd say the city has turned more rightwing , the left suffered a clear defeat in the municipal elections of 2014 . 
   so how many seats are in the assembly ? 
  it varies from region to region . 
  minimum is 49 in the guadeloupe regional council , maximum is 209 in the \u00cele-de-france regional council . 
   for me , i would n't like the party to choose who to represent me , i want to choose the exact candidate that i feel fits my needs . 
  what you have to understand is that the first candidate on a party list is the person that will be the president of the region if they win . 
  for example in ile-de-france everyone know that if the socialists win claude bartolone will become president of the ile-de-france region , the president is the head of the executive branch of the local government and take the main decisions . 
  the rest of elected candidates will be regional councilors that just vote ( except for a few in the majority that will be deputies to the president with a specific mission ) . 
  ( also note that the councillors , even though they are elected collectively and by the whole region still represent a certain area of the region . 
  lists have to present candidates from every * d\u00e9partement * of a * r\u00e9gion * . 
  for example a party can not just chose 209 candidates of paris for the ile-de-france election , the list must contain a certain amount of candidates from each d\u00e9partement . ), 
  yeah , it 's very unlikely , put perhaps in the north to stop the fn ... 
   stereotypical city overrun by immigrants immigrants represent 13 % of marseille 's population . 
  it 's far less than in strasbourg ( 19 % ) or paris ( 20 % ) . 
  elections are proportional , so each party ( or coalition ) has to present a group of candidates that are ordered , and depending of the percentage of votes they get , a certain number of the people of the list will be elected . 
  for example : let 's imagine there are 100 seats in the assembly , and 3 lists competing . 
  the first get 40 % of the votes , the second 32 % and the third 28 % . 
  seats will be distributed this way : first list will get automatically 25 % of the seats ( so 25 seats ) + 40 % of the remaining seats ( 40 % of 75 seats , so 30 seats ) . 
  so the first list will get 55 seats , and the first 55 candidates on their list will be elected . 
  the second list will get 32 % of 75 seats , so 24 seats . 
  the third list will get 28 % of the 75 seats , so 21 seats . 
  as you can see , with only 40 % of the votes the first list got 55 % of the seats and can rule alone . 
  the region is far bigger than the city of calais and has seen high fn votes way before the refugee problems . 
  do you know how the elections work ? 
  2 round system but with any party list that got more than 10 % of the votes at the first round . 
  and the party list that comes first at the second round get 25 % of the seats automatically + the rest of the seats is given proportionnally , so the fn can get 2 r\u00e9gions , perhaps even more . 
  are you serious ? 
  if the ps does not drop out the fn is sure to win in the north and in paca . 
  sorry , i did n't know they 'd look unreadable to some ... 
  i use res and do n't see any problem , even if i manually click i still see them clear . 
  let me know if you want me to upload another version !, 
  do they appear unreadable on your screen ? 
  i can read them on mine ... or perhaps are your referring to the fact that i erased the french words to write an english translation ? 
  ** edit : yes , so apparently the words are blocked out if you see the image on the imgur album page . 
  you just have to click to zoom and it will be readable . 
  ** ** anyway , here what 's written : `` voting intention for the 2nd round of the regional elections '' `` pink = leftwing lists , light blue : rightwing lists , dark blue = fn lists '' **, 
  how the elections work : 2 rounds ( except if one party list got more than 50 % of the votes at the first rounds ) , party lists that got more than 10 % of the votes at the first round are qualified for the 2nd turn . 
  party lists that got more than 5 % percent can merge with others . 
  i think that in every region at the 2nd turn there will only be 3 lists after merging : * ps & allies + probably the greens and perhaps the communists/left party ( it 's uncertain wether the left front will accept to merge with the ps or just ask to vote for them without participating ) * les r\u00e9publicains ( right ) + udi ( center-right ) ( this one will be sure since they 've already merged their lists for the first round ) * front national seats : 25 % of the seats go automatically to the first list , the rest of the seats are given proportionnaly . 
  basically , if there are only 3 lists at the second round that means that the list that get the first place will have the absolute majority . 
  i can not upvote you enough , the root of the problem is the archaic school system and the culture of shame , it has nothing to do with nostalgic people missing the time french was an international language . 
   french laws allows politicians to be elected for different mandates at the same time . 
  for instance , you can , at the same time , be a minister , a senator , a mayor , the president of a department ( a big district ) and the president of a region . 
  some mistakes here : - you ** can not be minister and deputy/senator at the same time ** , you ca n't mix executive and legislative powers - a mp can ** only have one other mandate ** in a local assembly ( two , if it 's in a commune of less than 1000 inhabitants ) - you ** can not be the president of two different local government ** at the same time ( for instance you can not be mayor of a commune and president of a region at the same time , except if the commune has less than 1000 inhabitants ) - you ** can not be member of more than two local assemblies ** ( you can not be a councilman in a commune , a d\u00e9partement and region at the same time , you 'd have to chose two ) - starting from 2017 , ** it will be forbidden to be mp and head of a local government at the same time ** ( no more mp that are also mayor , head of a d\u00e9partement or region but they will still be able to be mp and councilman at the same time ), 
  i think keeping the european parliament in strasbourg is a good thing . 
  strasbourg was supposed to be the official seat and is a huge symbol of reconciliation between former enemies . 
  besides , european institutions should n't be centered in one country , it 's what give people the impression that they are ruled by a bunch of technocrats in brussels . 
  with institutions all over eu the people would feel closer to the eu and see it as a common thing rather than a technocratic diktat from brussels . 
  yes , the only expensive schools in france are shitty schools for rich kids ( like communication school or shitty business school where the only criteria to get into is your money ) , or business schools for good students ( with very selective admission ) who will make a ton of money and easily reimburse their loan . 
   there 's even a story of a guy who was happy in the subway and said hello to people , proposed to share his newspaper and he got security called on him . 
  that was an article from le gorafi , the french `` the onion '' . 
   a grande ecole is a school that you can only enter after having passed two years in an ecole pr\u00e9paratoire there are also * grandes \u00e9coles * that are not prepared by * classes pr\u00e9paratoires * : ena , sciences po , en3s ... 
   ah the unions have always been strong in france . 
  this idea seems to be popular among people on this sub ( even french ones ) but is actually false . 
  french unions have historically been weaker than german or english ones and do n't have ties with political parties that could strengthen them . 
  actually , france has one of the lowest rate of unionized workers in the oecd , it 's even less than 5 % in the private sector . 
    french music stations usually air current french ( * ) artists in order to meet their quota . 
   aznavour , souchon , gall , sardou , gainsbourg ... 
  i would n't call any of that `` current '' , yet it 's the most frequent stuff on most french stations . 
  wtf ? 
  are you only listening to nostalgie ? 
  just listen to nrj , virgin radio , fun radio which are the popular stations among youth , you 'll hear no aznavour or sardou but a ton of ma\u00eetre gims , kendji girac or stroma\u00e9 . 
  well , i guess that mauriac was also popular beyond our borders then .
