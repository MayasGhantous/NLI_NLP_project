  thanks !, 
   the late italian prime minister , remarked that he liked germany so much that he was glad there were two of them . 
  actually i think this is a quote from [ fran\u00e7ois mauriac . 
   though french cinema is a shame , but it has always been the case . 
  are you serious ? 
  funny how when confronted with arguments you stop pretending to be `` knowledgeable about our institutions '' and switch back to something else . 
  too bad you do n't want to have a real discussion when people disagree with you . 
  a president will not dissolve the na if he thinks he will lose elections . 
  he 'd rather comply with his majority than lose his parliamentary support . 
  btw , the socialists mps have just voted amendments the government did not want in the last budget law . 
  you see , the government is not omnipotent on the parliament , as the threat of dissolution can only be used in a very limited number of cases . 
  just take a look a the government-parliament relations during the second term of mitterrand during 1988-1993 ( where the government had to switch between communists and centrists and constantly use 49.3 and vote of confidence ) or even with 1993-1997 right government , where the divisions between balladur , chirac and udf were such that the government was far from being free . 
  except the national assembly can vote of motion of no confidence to the government and make the government resign . 
  then you 'll tell me that the president could dissolve the assembly ( or threatens to ) to avoid such an issue . 
  still , this is something no one wants , because let say that if hollande had at some point chosen to dissolve the assembly there would have been a big chance he 'd have lost the next legislative elections , then being forced to have a cohabitation government and basically becoming powerless because , to a very large extent , the french president is only strong because the government and the parliament ( and above all public opinion ) deliberately accept to follow him as leader , if they do n't the president ca n't do much . 
  so is the threat of dissolution really that strong if everyone knows that it would be as bad for the president as it is for the parliament ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if at some point there had been a really strong majority of mps against valls , they could have censored him and chosen a new socialist pm , and hollande could have been forced to accept him/her in order to not lose his majority . 
  i know this is a highly hypothetical situation , but i just want to show that the power of the president is largely due to his perceived prevalence in terms of leadership and legitimacy ( reinforced by the direct election and the fact that the legislative election is just after the presidential election ) , and if those things are not accepted anymore , then the parliament can play a big role . 
  except you do n't seem to understand that the government is directly linked to the legislative election , not the presidential one . 
  there is separation of powers in france , but it 's a flexible one , a parliamentary one . 
  the government is chosen among the majority group in the assembly . 
  just look at what happens if the president and the parliament are not from the same parties : cohabitation , where the government is from the party of parliament , not of the president , and where the president has very few powers ( just think mitterrand 1986-1988 , 1993-1995 or chirac 1997-2002 , they could n't do much , besides pissing the government off with not signing * ordonnances * as mitterrand did at some point ) . 
  now since the legislative elections is just after the presidential one it has become very unlikely that they will produce a different outcome , hence people focus more on the most direct and personalised election ( the presidential one ) . 
  still , i do n't find relevant to separate so much the government and the parliament as you did , as one proceeds from the other . 
  and so , hypothetically , the legislative election could be the most important one , as if presidential and legislative elections gave different results , the real power would lie in the party that won the legislative election . 
  hollande will not get any money from this . 
  he did n't write the book . 
  it was written by two journalists that used to have frequent interviews with hollande . 
  actually no , it happened in 2002 . 
  it was quite an upset though . 
  there was a lot of center-left/leftwing candidates , so that diluted the center-left votes and the socialist party candidate finished third , at just 0,7 % behind the fn candidate . 
  in the second round the center-right candidate won with 82 % of the votes . 
  first round every candidate can participate . 
  the two candidates with the highest shares of vote qualify for the second round ( held two weeks later ) . 
  the winner of the second round is elected president . 
  for example in 2012 : candidate | 1st round | 2nd round -- | -- | -- *** hollande *** ( socialist party , center-left ) | ** 28.63 % ** | *** 51.64 % winner *** ** sarkozy ** ( ump , center-right/right ) | ** 27.18 % ** | ** 48.36 % ** le pen ( fn , far-right ) | 17.90 % | did not qualify m\u00e9lenchon ( fdg , leftwing ) | 11.10 % | did not qualify bayrou ( modem , centrist ) | 9.13 % | did not qualify joly ( eelv , ecologist ) | 2.31 % | did not qualify dupont-aignan ( dlr , eurosceptic gaullist right ) | 1.79 % | did not qualify poutou ( npa , far-left ) | 1.15 % | did not qualify arthaud ( lo , far-left ) | 0.56 % | did not qualify cheminade ( s&p , weirdo ) | 0.25 % | did not qualify, 
   they lost their press cards 4 years ago because they obviously were n't reporting news . 
  i do n't know if they managed to get them back . 
  some of them lost them ( mostly the comedians of the show ) , but their journalists ( or at least some ) kept them . 
  hmm no , the swiss occupation zone is not mulhouse and alsace ( alsace is the orange part of the map ) . 
  it looks like they are occupying a part of franche-comt\u00e9 . 
  actually le petit journal will continue ( as a part of le grand journal ) , canal + still has the rights for the name , but yann barth\u00e8s and the production team have left . 
  have you been following the news in france recently ? 
  how would you describe it ? 
  yes you 're reading it right . 
  jupp\u00e9 is high because he is seen as a moderate and would get the vote from the centrists ( bayrou has said he would not run if jupp\u00e9 was candidate ) . 
  source ( in french ) : http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2017/article/2016/06/01/presidentielle-hollande-ne-recueille-que-14-des-intentions-de-vote_4930246_4854003.html, 
  it was in verona . 
   almost at a 100 % rate ( namely the scandinavian countries , the benelux countries ) from my experience belgians are far from having a 100 % fluency rate in english ( at least the french-speaking ones ) . 
  yeah in france bidet it 's mostly a thing for old people/old houses . 
  fyi , the british metro newspaper has actually nothing to do with the metro international press group you 're talking about . 
  they both produce free newspapers for commuters but are n't related . 
  yep we have them , but only late in the campaign ( and indeed they usually contain a lot of awkwardness ) . 
  fun fact : starting from april 2017 the strasbourg tram will now reach kehl , germany !, 
  you do n't get nationality by simply having a child in france . 
  even the child would n't be french ( he could only ask for french nationality at age 13 , and would have to choose at age 18 ) . 
  for the parents to be french they 'd have to live there for a few years , legally , and then make a demand for citizenship . 
  no they do send representatives , and even though they have different laws and a certain autonomy they are still considered to be part of the republic ( it 's not comparable to uk dependencies for that matter ) . 
  contrary to a very common belief on r/europe , france 's high birthrate is not due to muslims or people of foreign decent ( even though they have a higher fertility rate , it is only marginally higher and they do n't account for a sizeable part of the population so that does n't make a big difference ) , but more likely to a a very developed set of public services and benefits dedicated to families and provided by the state . 
  on long term you 're right , but right now , even without immigration , france 's population would still grow for a simple reason : there arz more births than deaths in france . 
  on a long term though , when demographic structures will change and the effect of the baby boom disappear , you 're right , a 2.1 fertility rate is needed ( or immigration ) . 
  no , he was not invited , that 's why he did his stunt ( leaving a major news program while being interviewed to protest the fact that not all the candidates were invited to the debate ) . 
  had he be invited , you can be sure he would n't have cared about the five other `` small '' candidates not being invited . 
   it 's interesting how you say english is going well and then you live in a place where everything is dubbed ( ruining amazing movies and series in the proces ) it 's the case for all the big countries in europe ( germany , italy , spain , france , poland ) . 
  also , movie theatres and televisions channels often offer you the possibility to see the movie in english with french subtitles , something that has become very popular amongst young people . 
   and you have a virtually separated internet that is french only . 
  is there no dutch internet ? 
  if it 's case i 'm sorry for you , because you 're missing something out . 
  france has no specificity here , there is an internet in every major language ( very big german internet scene for example ) . 
   i also wonder where those young educated people speaking english are since the only ones i have ever seen are those involved in exchanges ( erasmus or travel associations ) that 's already a large number of students , no ? 
  also , just because a french person does n't talk to you in english does not mean they ca n't , it 's often that they are very afraid to do so and they would probably even be more intimated by the almost-perfect english most dutch speak . 
   most european countries have a healthy national tv and movie scene . 
  they do focus on small scale or historic work since that is what they do well . 
  which ones are 100 % american ? 
  just an example i know , hungary released something like only 5 movies in 2010 , national movies accounted for less than 5 % of cinema admissions . 
  in the netherlands it 's something like 10-15 % while in countries like france or germany it 's in the 40-45 % range . 
  of course the size of the markets explain a lot of things , but you also have to take into consideration the very active policies towards national cultural production in those countries . 
   it would require french people to speak a second a language well enough to converse with other which is very uncommon now in france . 
  i 'd say that most young educated people have now a decent level in english . 
  and we send tens of thousands of students in erasmus exchange each year , so it 's not like french people only want to speak french . 
  we may not be very good at learning languages but at least we try , it is mandatory for every french student to learn two foreign languages . 
  the problem comes from our education system that is terrible when it comes to language , there is not enough emphasis on oral work and most student have this sort of anxiety of speaking a foreign language because we feel we 're not speaking it good enough . 
   it would also `` threaten your culture '' as your government would say so and has always protected in any large trade agreements . 
  i do n't think that anyone in france would think that more cultural imports from other european countries would be a threat to our culture . 
  and even currently we are probably one of the biggest markets for other european movies for example , i 've been able to see a lot of them in cinemas here . 
  also our laws that provide for quotas and public fundings often include european productions as well . 
  for example , every french tv channel has to invest the equivalent of 3.2 % of its revenue in european productions ( so it can be french , but also a german or spanish movie for example , the law makes a difference between american and european productions ) . 
  regarding our policy of cultural protection , i certainly do not like all of its elements , but i 'm quitte happy to see that we still have a pretty large production in all cultural sectors when some other european countries have almost 100 % american movies and music . 
  the audio is in german or french , but there are english ( and spanish or polish ) subtitles available !, 
  hmm no , he [ died ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-marie_bonnassieux ) in paris , aged 81 . 
   older people tends to vote le pen and vice versa . 
  no , actually le pen has her worst scores with retired people , and conversely scores her highest with young people . 
  you 're mixing up fo and lo , they are unrelated . 
  fo ( force ouvri\u00e8re ) , is an union . 
  lutte ouvri\u00e8re ( lo ) is a far-left party , by far the farthest to the left of all competing party and the more old-school and closed one . 
  yeah but in this cas in was n't in coll\u00e8ge ( 11-15 ) , it was in lyc\u00e9e 15-18 ) . 
   if they do more than 5 % , they 'll get fully reimbursed of everything they spent during the campaign . 
  and they will do more than 5 % it 's not fully reimbursed , just half of it . 
  so they still need to get money .
