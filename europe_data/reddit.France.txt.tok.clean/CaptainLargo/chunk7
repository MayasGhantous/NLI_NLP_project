  with something as subjective as beauty , and stats as limited as the ones from miss universe , you ca n't say much really . 
  also with those stats europe is full of ugly ladies since most countries have never won , france being among the few countries to have ever won the competition . 
  yeah i think that the balkans and france have very different views about this . 
  for example , nobody would think of people of overseas territory as `` foreigners '' , so even if both her parents were black that would be the same . 
  no one would consider her to be only a french citizen but not being `` technically a native french '' . 
  also people do n't really think in terms of being ethnic french , france has had a long history of immigration and never really built itself on a notion of french race , at least not as much as other countries . 
  i do n't say that there are no racist in france , or that there a no problem with integration , but at least the core ideas behind `` frenchness '' is not really an ethnic one . 
  if you mean the first black miss france , no , the first one was in 1993 and we 've had several since . 
  everyone in france considers overseas parts of france to be as french as the rest of the country . 
  we 've had several miss that were non-white and nobody complains . 
  we also had miss france from foreign descent and people did not complain either because people in france do n't think in terms of `` ethnic french '' , ( i.e. 
  you do n't have to be a white people from mainland france to be considered french ) . 
   her father is a white frenchman though , so i doubt it will be that much of an uproar . 
  what uproar would you expect ? 
  we 've had several non-white miss france , and i do n't think that ever caused public outcry or something like this . 
  also i do n't think the fact her father is a white `` frenchman '' changes anything . 
  people from guyane ( and other overseas parts of france ) are mostly non-white and are considered as french as anyone else , even by the fn . 
  i 'd say it dclearly is for the north east part of paris ( xviiie , xixe , xxe ) which are the `` bad '' parts of paris . 
  but i 'm more surprised by the southern parts of xve and xive being red : those are not usually considered bad neighbourhoods . 
   why did he have to summon them to versailles ? 
  why could n't he have gone to the french assembly instead , the way the american president goes to congress for the state of the union ? 
  imagine the uproar in america if trump summoned all the senators and congressmen to mar-a-largo just to hear him give a speech . 
  because it 's the law ? 
  the congress can only be summoned in versailles . 
  and it 's forbidden for the president to give a speech to the national assembly or the senate . 
  there 's only an obligation to declare a situation where a mp would employ another mp 's family member , it 's not illegal . 
  '' note that this applies for mp 's to the family of other mp 's '' actually i think it does n't and that was pointed out as one of the flaws of the law . 
  i 'm so happy we do n't have tabloid newspapers in france . 
  he was n't actually short though, 
  drom are basically like metropolitan france but just far away , they have no autonomy/special status . 
  com ( overseas collectivities ) have greater autonomy , and they each have a specific status ( e.g. 
  french polynesia does not have the same autonomy as saint-pierre-et-miquelon ) . 
  but yes , even com are integral part of the republic and have representation in the national parliament , they count as french soil , not foreign ( they have far less autonomy than british overseas territory and crown dependencies , which are not part of uk , iirc ) . 
  transportation is way cheaper in paris though , a metro pass is ridiculously expensive in london . 
  this is fairly misleading . 
  when you look at the data from the survey you can see that ** only 12 % think it 's morally acceptable ** , which is on par with italian and german results . 
  the big difference is not that french think is acceptable , it 's that way more people in france ( 40 % ) think it 's not a moral issue ( but do n't say it 's acceptable either ) . 
  strasbourg still looks like that , the city was mostly preserved from destruction . 
  today it 's one of the only remaining examples of jugendstill and late-19th / early-20th century architecture . 
  the german part of the city ( 1871-1918 ) has recently been designated a unesco world heritage site , it 's a really nice city to visit !, 
  in the uk `` asian '' usually refers to south asian people , there 's no conspiracy here . 
  stx france has already 10 years of ship building planned , they wo n't cost `` pennies '' . 
  you 're mistaking polynesia for new caledonia . 
   fincantieri is one of the biggest companies in its sector ** the french company is bankrupt ** seriously , with such statement you just seem to know nothing about the topic . 
  the shipyard are far from being bankrupt , they have 10 years of work already planned and have recently built the largest cruise ships in the world . 
  it 's their previous owner , a korean company , that went bankrupt and had to sell the french shipyards ( their only valuable assets ) . 
   governor of albi wut ? 
  it 's not illegal . 
  we have stats on crimes perpetrated by foreigners in france . 
  is it the fertility rate of those people in their original country or in the uk ? 
  ( like is 3.8 the fertilty rate of pakistanis in the uk or in pakistan ? 
  i get that we might have more `` soft power '' than under hollande , but c'mon , more soft power than the us ? 
  that 's bullshit . 
   une village francaise un village fran\u00e7ais *  it 's a very good tv show btw , highly recommend . 
  what 's an ethnic french ? 
  this notion is n't used in france . 
  https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/demographic-facts-sheets/faq/france-fertility-level-no-immigrants/ ( french national institute for demographic studies ) what would be the level of fertility in france if there were no immigrants ? 
  in france , one birth in 8 is to an immigrant mother , while only one inhabitant in 14 is an immigrant , i.e. 
  a foreign national born outside france and who has been living in france for over a year . 
  immigrants contribute more to the birth rate than native french people because they are more often of childbearing age and because their fertility is slightly higher than the rest of the population -- half a child more per woman on average . 
  this fertility difference has little impact on the national average . 
  ** fertility in france was 1.92 children per woman in 2005 , and without immigrants it would have been 1.82 . 
  yep , same for france , bosnia , belarus , turkey , ukraine , russia and ireland . 
  the lines between tours and bordeaux and le mans and rennes were just finished last week . 
  it now takes only 1h25 to travel from paris to rennes , and 2h04 from paris to bordeaux !, 
  and the line between paris and strasbourg was finished last year , it now takes 1h46 from paris to strasbourg , it 's amazing !, 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/high_speed_railroad_map_of_europe.svg?uselang=fr ) is the correct map for france, 
  i 'm talking about people 's concern over the issue of regional language ( i.e. 
  very few people care , even in alsace , people were concerned when we merged the regions for example , but they did not mention language as an issue ) . 
  same in some places in alsace . 
  good luck finding a young frenchman ( without foreing roots ) whose mother tongue is not french . 
  even people from britanny , alsace , etc. 
  have french as their mother tongue . 
  yes , but it 's mostly old people and in rural areas . 
  i think it 's something like 30 % or 40 % of the local population according to surveys , but i 'd take those numbers with a grain of salt though , people often overestimate their proefficiency ( or their actual use of the language ) . 
  you wo n't hear much alsatian in strasbourg ( except if you 're going to a retirement home ) , but it would n't be too hard to find people speaking it in a village . 
  that would mostly be old people though , there are very few children actually speaking alsatian , even though some understand it . 
  for example , i know the son of the journalist that 's in charge of the alsatian-dubbed local news , and even though his mother speaks perfect alsatian , himself ca n't ( though he understands it quite well ) . 
  ahhhh , r/europe 's favorite topic : the endangered regional languages of france . 
  it 's funny that this gets so much attention here while no one gives a fuck in france . 
  i live in alsace and i swear i 've heard far more people complaining about french language policy here than in real life . 
  well technically it 's the `` real '' parliament , even though in practice you 're right , 
  good point actually , i 'll correct that . 
  technically brittany , alsace and the basque country should be in the darker blue , french is the sole official language there . 
  do n't be angry , being conquered by the normans was the best thing that ever happened to england , 
  italia !, 
  portugal !, 
  france !, 
  romance five , by the power of latin heritage , unite !, 
  yes it 's the * m\u00e9moires * of de gaulle . 
  and the two books on the right are * le rouge et le noir * by stendhal , and * les nourritures terrestres * by andr\u00e9 gide . 
  yes , so many people make the mistake in france !, 
  actual `` rond-points '' are actually quite uncommon . 
  yet we have fifteen billions `` carrefour \u00e0 sens giratoire '' ( every commune has built its own ) but everyone call them `` rond-points '' ( but they are not , since priority is given to the car in the circle , not the ones coming ) . 
  in paris there are no `` carrefour \u00e0 sens giratoire '' , only `` rond-points '' ( like the arc de triomphe ) , where priority is given to cars coming from outside the circle . 
  it probably does n't help that the english word roundabout is closer to `` rond-point '' but actually means `` carrefours \u00e0 sens giratoire '' ( which seems to be the actual translation if you do n't know the technicality ) . 
  why though ? 
  i know that british overseas territories are considered distinct from the uk but it 's not the case for french overseas regions and departments . 
  they are integral and normal parts of france , they have no legal differences with mainland france . 
  data are not correct : french population is [ 67m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population ) , and is higher than uk 's .
