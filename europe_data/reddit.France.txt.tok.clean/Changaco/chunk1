i consider myself a liberal and a democrat , hollande is neither of those things imo . 
  it 's not a democracy at all , do n't let `` representative democracy '' fool you . 
  this kind of regime is more accurately called `` representative government '' or `` elective oligarchy '' . 
  as if they 'd listen ... politicians thrive on fake debates like supply vs demand . 
  an even bigger one is left vs right : it splits the people in two , turns citizens against each other , keeps the oligarchs in power . 
  it 's divide and conquer . 
  besides it 's not the government you need to convince of alternative ideas , it 's the people . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say here . 
  there is no such thing as a `` true meaning '' for `` left '' and `` right '' in politics . 
  words like `` anarchism '' or `` plutocracy '' have a `` true '' meaning because of their etymology , but `` left '' and `` right '' do n't have a political meaning . 
  i seriously do n't understand how this demand vs supply nonsense can still be going on after so many years . 
  you folks should have realized by now that demand and supply are inseparable , that they depend on each other . 
   both republican and democrat parties are liberal . 
  no they 're not , the patriot act is the first example of anti-liberalism that comes to my mind . 
  sorry , but you 're totally missing the point of the quote . 
  it 's about many jobs being meaningless , because their creation is the result of everyone having to earn a living , instead of people doing what they think is actually useful . 
  i do n't know if it was the author 's intention , but this quote can be interpreted as arguing in favor of basic income . 
  it 's newspeak . 
  by using words to say the opposite of what they mean you can get people to think that they live in a '' [ liberal democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_democracy ) '' , when in fact it 's an elective oligarchy . 
  what you said is not what `` lib\u00e9ral '' means , it 's what anti-liberals like yourself think it means . 
  yes `` neoliberal '' is a bit better , but it still fuels the confusion . 
  though i understand what you meant , the rsa is not a [ basic income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_income ) . 
  it 's also not true to say that france exports `` nearly nothing '' . 
   that kinds of defeat a bunch of points though not really , it 's still a big simplification even if a few additional benefits remain . 
   surely including 1/2 a share for kids means getting rid of parental subsidies ? 
  is n't that what i said ? 
   just do n't give it to the kids . 
  or maybe do give it to them ? 
  it 's open for debate , the answer may not be the same in all countries . 
  1 - it 's not `` on top '' of existing benefits , it replaces the ones that can be replaced without the poor being worse off , and the others that ca n't be replaced will be adjusted and come on top of ubi . 
  2 - i do n't know about your country , but we have quite a few subsidies in france that you can benefit from if you have kids , from a cash transfer at the beginning of the school year to income tax cuts . 
  those would be advantageously replaced by ubi . 
  itt : people stuck in the 20th century . 
  i was n't talking about any specific tax , the reasoning is generic and also applies to the overall tax rate . 
  your claim that bi requires doubling or tripling the overall tax rate is not a universal truth , for example bi does not require doubling the overall tax rate in countries like france , nor would it be possible since it 's already more than 50 % . 
  as i previously said the relative increase of the nominal tax rate is irrelevant . 
  tripling is fine if the current rate is 5 % , problematic if it 's 15 % , and not realistic if it 's 45 % . 
  the fact that the tax funds a basic income matters because a bi is like a universal tax credit : it lowers the effective tax rate by returning the money to you . 
  no , it would n't . 
  i 've already said so in [ another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0jyc/how_popular_is_basic_income_in_your_country/cv2ef9x?context=1 ) . 
   do you seriously think that while polish wages are 4 times lower than in germany , everything is 4 times cheaper as well ? 
  no , the relation is n't linear , but prices and incomes do affect each other , so your claim that there is a very big gap between one and the other in poland seems weird to me . 
   either way it being a huge drain to economy while providing little to no benefits . 
  some people say the same thing in france , because they ca n't imagine living with 500 $ a month , but that 's what the poor currently receive here . 
  it 's true that it 's not enough in many situations , but the poor would rather have 500 $ of individual unconditional cash than nothing at all , or than the same amount of conditional benefits that require endless paperwork . 
  basic income does n't need to be high enough to live off it , you can start low and increase gradually . 
  in a way conditional welfare programs have been the gradual approach to basic income : first try to give money only to people who need it , then realize that it 's too bureaucratic , that some people are being left out , and that we 're better off generalizing and automating it . 
  your reasoning only makes sense if the budget is constant , but it is n't , i 've already told you that there would be a tax increase to cover the additional cost of giving money to everyone . 
   in a basic income society , what exactly would get replaced with the basic income sum ? 
  every benefit whose amount is below said sum . 
  you cant just magically spawn billions of $ to give away to people actually the ecb can , but let 's not go into that . 
   also wouldnt tons of government bureaucracy workers become unemployed ? 
  probably not . 
  bi would be much simpler , but some bureaucrats would still be needed , especially during the transition period , and after that i guess we could find something else for them to do , at least for those who would want to . 
   edit : also wouldnt prices rise ? 
  it 's unlikely if the bi is funded through taxes since it 's only redistributing money and not increasing the monetary mass . 
  we 're getting lost in numbers , somehow people manage to survive in poland , which means the money to cover the living costs is there . 
  so , the real obstacle to redistributing it through a basic income is the same as everywhere else : the people 's acceptance of such a system . 
  1 - ubi should only replace benefits whose amounts are below its own , otherwise people are worse off as / u/owynb pointed out . 
  2 - most ubi proposals include a partial one for children , often half of the adult amount . 
  your reasoning can be turned the other way in support of basic income : with bi nobody is forced to work , without it the poor are forced to work while the rich rentiers relax on their yachts . 
   * most * people do n't want to . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  i said '' * could * support '' and clearly stated that it was an opinion poll , i never claimed 60 % of the population knows about basic income and actively supports it . 
  i was talking about namibia , not poland . 
  why would bi be 4-5 times lower if living costs are only 20-30 % lower ? 
  if you mean that some of them advocated a negative income tax instead of a basic income , then let me point out that the redistributive effect is the same . 
  the relative increase in taxes is irrelevant and would be different in each country . 
  what matters is for the tax rate to remain reasonable , otherwise the financial incentive to work disappears . 
  also , i 've mentioned in [ another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0jyc/how_popular_is_basic_income_in_your_country/cv28dw0 ) why the cost of bi is a little misleading . 
  people in those countries do n't need hundreds of euros a month , the living costs are lower than in western europe , so a lower bi is normal and still useful . 
  [ list of countries by gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ), 
  `` right-libertarians '' want to eliminate government interference whether or not there 's a basic income . 
  it does n't mean that bi is plot to fuck over the poor by pretending to help them . 
  obviously switching to basic income requires raising taxes , you do n't fund it with public debt . 
  i have no idea what a reasonable amount would be for poland , but like i said in [ another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0jyc/how_popular_is_basic_income_in_your_country/cv28h55 ) pretty much any country can fund a basic income . 
  i never said all would remain the same ( what would be the point of a reform that does n't change anything ? 
  ) , i said the people currently on benefits would n't lose . 
  relevant : [ the backyard digging point ] ( https://ploum.net/backyard-digging-point/ ) . 
  actually your country 's economic level is n't that relevant . 
  for example one of the recent pilot programs was in namibia , and that country could fund a basic income , it would simply be much lower than one in france or germany . 
  the cost of basic income is somewhat misleading , it 's not like normal tax money that the government has in its budget and can use for whatever , instead it 's money that goes right back into citizens ' bank accounts . 
  the tax increase is to cover the additional cost of basic income compared to the conditional benefits it replaces . 
  people who currently receive benefits are n't supposed to lose money in the transition to basic income , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  benefits that were higher than the new basic income would top it up , so that people have approximately the same disposable income . 
   not economically viable well , [ quite a few economists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_income#advocacy ) disagree with you on that . 
  you seem to be talking about minimum wage , not basic income . 
  there are a lot of different answers to that question , from justifications based on human rights to simple pragmatism , some of them have already been mentioned in the replies to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0jyc/how_popular_is_basic_income_in_your_country/cv25gh1 ) . 
  there would be a tax increase , yes . 
  however , with basic income the money goes right back into people 's bank accounts . 
  there can be other benefits on top of basic income , for example an additional amount for people who are handicapped . 
  there is a detailed plan on how to fund a 450 $ basic income in france , mostly with a 25 % income tax , if you read french [ here it is ] ( http://www.generationlibre.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/un-liber-pour-tous.pdf ) . 
  bi is supported by [ people from all sides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_income#advocacy ) , including some socialists/communists . 
  the famous `` bi is just a plot by ` ultra-liberals ' to dismantle your hard-fought rights '' theory , one of the most ridiculous `` argument '' against basic income , with no evidence whatsoever to back it up . 
  neither do we , but bi is n't communism . 
  edit : by `` we '' i mean the french people , and by `` is n't communism '' i mean that it 's not specifically communist because it 's an idea that transcends ideologies . 
   hard to palette uh , `` palate '' ? 
  you should n't say `` energy consumption '' when you mean `` electricity consumption '' , it 's misleading , electricity is only a fraction of a country 's total energy consumption . 
  that 's a condescending non-answer , you have in no way demonstrated that the meanings are close enough for the two words to be considered synonyms . 
  they 're not synonyms .
