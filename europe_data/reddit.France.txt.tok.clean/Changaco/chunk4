  some are relatively close to the current system , others have methods of monetary creation that are n't based on debt at all : bitcoin-like systems ( based on `` mining '' ) , universal dividend ( fixed-rate creation distributed in equal shares to citizens ) . 
  there are quite a few resources on this topic , ranging from eli5 videos to papers by imf economists , and there are advocacy groups in various countries , e.g. 
  [ positivemoney ] ( http://positivemoney.org/ ) in the uk . 
  some of these are not monarchies ( societies ruled by a single person ) , though they 're still kingdoms ( societies that have kings ) . 
  how about these : the [ end of roaming charges ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/europe-abolishes-mobile-phone-roaming-charges ) , the [ sepa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_euro_payments_area ) , the [ esm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism ) , the [ ecis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_citizens%27_initiative ) ( even though they are poorly designed ) . 
   i highly doubt germany is out to get europe in every measure , but considering they seem to call all the shots nowadays they may seem to be calling all the shots , but that does n't mean they really are . 
  other countries are backing germany 's positions , which people conveniently forget to mention when they blame germany , and merkel is a media magnet , which makes it look like she 's more important , but in reality i 'm not aware of any big europen decision having been taken by the german government without at least the consent of the french government . 
  there are several reasons why this does n't work , including the lack of not-privacy-damaging business model , and the fact that early adopters are basically talking to an empty room ( so you have a hard time growing a user base ) . 
   i feel like these multiple round style elections do n't necessarily cause the most representative governments . 
  it 's not supposed to be representative , it 's designed so that the list who receives the most votes gets a majority of seats . 
  huh ? 
  i did n't say the ecb should loan money directly to people , that 's not its job . 
  yes , saying that qe is `` free money '' is an oversimplification , but it basically comes down to that . 
  you should read the site i linked to . 
  there 's this crazy thing called the ecb that hands out free money ... to people who already have plenty of it . 
  maybe [ it 's them that you should call ] ( http://www.qe4people.eu/ ) . 
   while i agree with you on terms of ideology , there is a thing defined by both convention and international law called a sovereign state . 
  yeah , i guess that 's where the problem comes from . 
  it seems like a poorly worded expression to me . 
   and in truth , the people are always sovereign if they are determined enough and enough are intent on a change . 
  indeed , though maybe a better way to put it is that a population can always proclaim its sovereignty , which is n't exactly the same thing as always being sovereign . 
  sovereignty is about who has the last word , and that 's always the people in a democracy , not any level of government . 
  that `` sovereignty '' issue is bullshit , you do n't lose sovereignty by voluntarily joining a federation that you can quit at any time . 
  not being sovereign is living under a system that does n't respect the right to self-determination of the people , like a dictatorship . 
  and steganography to avoid detection , if they wished to and were smart enough . 
   yeah , cause yours was better . 
  yes , i did n't imply that you 're dumb . 
   sorry mate , but you really dont have a ground to stand on in this . 
  as i said , the definition of liberty i 'm using is the legal one in france and dates back to the time franklin was alive . 
  moreover , the first definition in the dictionary you linked to is `` freedom from arbitrary or despotic government or control '' , that 's perfectly in line with what i 've been saying . 
  you also mentioned ancient societies and liberty as opposed to slavery : not being a slave did n't mean you had no constraints whatsoever , there were rules just like there are in today 's societies . 
   if it had more nuance , we could dicuss this point . 
  but it doesnt have nuance . 
  it 's a short sentence taken out of context , of course it lacks nuance . 
   in there it sais in essence `` if youre not for absolute liberty , youre not for liberty at all '' . 
  no , that 's only your interpretation of it . 
  i strive to be rational and positive . 
  hate is useful if you 're in the heat of combat , but we 're not . 
  oh my , that condescending tone . 
   no , im defining freedom exactly the way its defined . 
  in that you are free to do whatever you want . 
  the lack of any constraint is one definition of freedom , but it 's not the legal definition of liberty . 
  the definition i quoted is the current one of the french constitution , from the 1789 declaration . 
   and where do you draw that line , huh ? 
  it does n't matter where the line is exactly , the important thing is to maintain a reasonable equilibrium . 
  the european and us views on free speech are both reasonable . 
  that 's what the * conseil constitutionnel * is for . 
  the definition is n't supposed to be unambiguous , it only has to be coherent . 
  there is n't really a frontline with terrorism . 
  we can try to prevent outsiders from coming in , but that wo n't stop them from recruiting natives . 
   they want us to hate them , to make our society hostile to them . 
  it seems to me that they want us to fear/hate all muslims , to reinforce their crusade narrative so that more people will join them . 
   why not ? 
  because hate is a depressing and dangerous emotion ? 
  there are a lot of possibilities between `` not doing anything '' and `` completely changing our foreign policy and barricading ourselves '' . 
  i do n't pretend to have all the answers , but i 've put some of my thoughts about possible solutions into [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3srn55/paris_attacks_were_act_of_war_organised_by/cx00xis ) . 
   so what would you propose ? 
  nothing ? 
  i have no recommendations concerning foreign policy , it 's not my area of expertise , but now that the damage is done i doubt pulling out would solve the problem . 
  on the other hand there are plenty of ideas on how to fix our own society . 
  we need to take better care of our own people so that they do n't feel rejected and fall into terrorism . 
  we need to stop wasting police resources and creating criminals by prohibiting drugs . 
  we need to increase our efforts in cutting our dependency on fossil fuels , because they 're a major component of geopolitical issues that make it much harder to resolve conflicts . 
  in the short term we can try to increase security , but it should n't be through permanent laws that sacrifice liberty , and it should n't be at the expanse of long term actions to fix the causes of terrorism . 
   the truth is , whatever we do about this will be directly dictated by them . 
  not really , the terrorists are pushing us to react , but the substance of our reaction is entirely up to us and does n't have to be what the terrorists wanted . 
  the analogy does n't fit . 
  terrorism succeeds in killing a minority of people , but that 's not the goal , it 's only a means to cause dissent in the population and changes in foreign policy ; those are n't inevitable , they only happen if you let them happen . 
   stop the refugee flow . 
  how is closing borders going to help when the terrorists are natives ? 
   do n't get involved in middle east at all . 
  that would reinforce the idea that terrorism works , and that isis was right all along . 
  your comment is a fallacy : you 're defining `` freedom '' in a self-destructive way so you can conclude that it has to be restricted . 
  the self-coherent definition of liberty is `` being able to do anything that does n't impede on the rights of others '' , which implies that the law ca n't prohibit things that do not seriously threaten someone 's rights , nor force citizens to do things that are not necessary for the preservation of those rights . 
  that 's the principle of liberty that must not be sacrificed for `` security '' . 
  anarchy ( absence of authority ) \u2260 anomie ( lack of rules ) . 
  and they waste a lot more of that delicate resource than we do . 
  you do n't need any powers to read someone 's public facebook comments and receive tips from concerned citizens who noticed someone 's strange behaviour . 
   we 're moving it seems likely to me that pretty much everything that can be moved has been moved by now . 
  on the other hand there is a small reversed movement : a few factories are coming back . 
  nazis are `` socialists '' . 
  on wikipedia [ national socialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialism ) redirects to nazism . 
  no , they could n't . 
  obviously the european constitution would reaffirm the principle of subsidiarity and limit the power of the federal government , just like the current eu has limited powers , and just like the states in the us have a good amount of leeway ( which results in some of them being more progressive than others ) . 
  nothing is impossible , and at the latest everyone should have realized that trump could win when the brexit vote happened . 
   it 's a presidential system where the president has a lot more power . 
  that 's true , but less so if the national assembly does n't support the president , which is unlikely but not impossible . 
   you know , i 'm pretty sure le pen will be on the second round . 
  that 's an easy prediction , it 's what all the polls say : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_de_sondages_sur_l%27%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_fran%c3%a7aise_de_2017, 
  do n't expect the same result as 2002 . 
  marine is not jean-marie , and the fn has become a lot more popular . 
  it 's far from certain that marine will lose , especially if her opponent makes mistakes . 
   the ecb wants/needs the price of * everything * to increase , including prices on the labor market ( i.e. 
  that 's your salary ) . 
  the ecb 's inflation target is n't for wages , it 's for consumer goods and services , as measured by the [ harmonised index of consumer prices ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hicp ) . 
   if you arbitrarily increase the prices in a given market [ ... ] while every other factor ( including the supply ) remain constant , you have yourself a distortion ( i.e. 
  a bubble ) . 
  `` all other things being equal '' is a classic error in economic reasoning . 
  in reality the supply is not constant , it 's influenced by demand ( and vice versa ) , and is only limited by production capacity ( which we 're not using in full right now ) . 
   the tool to do this is credit because * credit * gives an incentive to the borrower to create sustainable * wealth * through carefully planed investment , as opposed to * spending * .
