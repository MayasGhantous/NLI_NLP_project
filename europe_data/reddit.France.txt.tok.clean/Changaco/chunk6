  in developed countries there 's plenty enough to feed , clothe , and house everyone , and in fact we already provide all that to almost everyone . 
  basic income is a way of accomplishing that more efficiently , so we know it 's possible because we 're already doing it , and thus if your math says we ca n't it means you got it wrong . 
  fyi a number of economists have endorsed basic income , and some of them have actively researched the issue of funding and produced detailed studies that show how it can be done properly . 
  it 's not just young people , entrepreneurs ( including freelancers , farmers , etc ) also have variable income and would benefit from bi . 
  denmark does not undermine anyone 's sovereignty by accepting immigrants on its own soil . 
  doing so does not mean that these people can legally move to other eu members . 
  they will only be able to do that if they become eu citizens , and when that happens they wo n't really be `` immigrants '' anymore . 
  finally , even though these new citizens would have the right to move to other countries i doubt many will want to go where they 're clearly not welcome . 
  open borders ( i.e. 
  [ schengen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area ) ) are n't very relevant , your problem is with free movement , which has been a core part of the single market for a long time . 
   if germany , poland and italy are against inviting them in , then denmark obviously should n't be able to do so . 
  this part of your argument is flawed , denmark has as much right to choose who it wants to accept as other countries have the right to choose who they want to reject . 
  i find the whole concept of secret talks problematic , ideally the negotiations would be transparent . 
  you could also mention that macron is allied with bayrou . 
   as for the eu 's economic governance , the crisis has demonstrated that the eu has very little in terms of organized crisis-response mechanisms . 
  that was true , but things have changed . 
  the [ esm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism ) has been created for crisis response , and macroeconomic surveillance has been put in place for crisis prevention . 
   why not take the system every european country uses and just add a senate in which the member states are involved . 
  that 's pretty much how the eu works now , and they did try to consolidate the treaties into a proper constitution too , but it was rejected by referendums . 
  very nice , and [ open source ] ( https://github.com/corradio/electricitymap ) . 
  do n't worry , romanian politics are n't really visible from france either . 
  good detailed answer . 
  :-) off the top of my head i would add to the good things the general effort towards [ modernization of the administration ] ( http://modernisation.gouv.fr/ ) and [ open data ] ( http://www.data.gouv.fr/ ) ( e.g. 
  the database that contains all french laws was n't open until 2014 ) . 
  this will have long-term positive effects . 
  i somewhat agree with you on bad things , but obviously we wo n't make a complete list , and debating every point i do n't fully agree with would take too much time . 
  there may not be anyone better in the socialist party , but outside of it there 's macron who seems to inspire more people while being `` center-left '' . 
  your original message was clearly criticizing the french people , for favoring `` idealistic '' politicians in elections . 
  because you 'd go along with any idea that allows you to deliver your unwarranted french bashing ? 
  gay marriage may be the only thing you remember ( probably because of the protests ) , but it 's unlikely to be the only government action in the past five years that you would consider to be `` good '' if you were faced with a list of everything that 's been done . 
  how valls could be an inspiration to anyone is beyond me , then again you admit that you only have a partial view of french politics so that could explain it . 
  as the pm he 's co-responsible for pretty much every government failure in the last few years . 
   not the absolute amount paid i did n't say we should look at absolute amounts , i said we should use a percentage of money spent when considering consumption taxes like vat , not a percentage of income . 
  if you want to discuss fair tax systems you need to look at the whole , but if you 're examining a single tax then you have to consider only its own domain . 
   ( bearing in mind vat disproportionately hits poorer people ) that 's a popular belief , but in reality it 's more complicated than that . 
  i have yet to see actual numbers showing that the rich pay less in vat proportionally to their consumption ( as opposed to a percentage of their income , which tells us nothing except that the rich save/invest more than the poor , which is very obvious ) . 
  and to clarify what i 'm saying , `` hardcore liberalism '' is a nonsense to me , because liberty is about balance , and i do n't see how anyone can be in favour of an `` extremely balanced '' situation . 
  balance is by definition a middle ground , the opposite of `` hardcore '' positions . 
  what you 're calling `` hardcore liberalism '' is probably libertarianism , which is based on a different definition of liberty . 
  it 's less of a problem in the uk because nobody passes there as a step on the way to somewhere else , it 's the final destination , so when they arrive they look for a job and a place to live instead of staying on the streets . 
  quite frankly it 's not liberal to me , but it 's because i probably do n't have the same definition of liberalism as / u/liptonreddit . 
  liberalism is n't minarchism , it is n't always * laissez-faire * , and it definitely is n't trickle-down economics . 
  liberalism is all about liberty , and liberty is balance between people 's rights ( article 4 of the [ 1789 declaration of rights ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/translation:declaration_of_the_rights_of_man_and_of_the_citizen ) ) . 
  the bad reputation of liberalism comes from politicians and economists who call themselves liberals but claim things that are sometimes unrelated or even contradictory with the principle of liberty . 
   people might not see it but fillon winning the primary is the best thing that could have happened to le pen . 
  so far the polls disagree with you . 
  sarkozy being lr 's candidate would have been the best thing for everyone else since plenty of people still despise him . 
   more economical protectionism that the eu single market currently forbids while the rest of the world fucks us with ( china , brazil , the us , y' all have protectionistic measures we ca n't use here in europe ) . 
  fyi the eu can do protectionism ... if the governments agree that it 's a good idea , but therein lies the rub . 
   greece would benefit from being able to devalue their own currency if they had one . 
  not really , greece 's current economy does n't seem to be based on sectors that would really benefit from having a nation currency . 
  they 'd just all become poorer instantly . 
  moreover it would be a mess to sort out drachmas from euros , especially regarding debts ( should this one be paid back in euros or drachmas ? 
  who has jurisdiction ? 
  i 'm not familiar with what the rating agencies use , can you give me a link to an overview of their method ? 
  macron is atypical , he 's the only candidate to be credited with more than 10 % of votes in polls who is n't a career politician and does n't have an established political party backing him up . 
  he 's also the youngest ( 38 ) , while fillon , m\u00e9lenchon , and le pen have been in politics since before i can remember , and for the first two since before i was even born . 
  his line so far is `` i 'm neither left-wing nor right-wing , i 'm a progressive '' . 
  to some people he 's the `` extraneous '' candidate who 's going to make the left-wing lose by dividing voters , but if you look at the polls he 's currently the only `` left-wing '' candidate who has a small chance of making it to the second round and winning . 
  to clarify , i was n't saying i agree with mundell , i was merely pointing out that your original assertion is debatable . 
  it 's not `` crystal-clear that the euro is a bad idea '' , if it was mundell would agree , and the wikipedia page would n't state that `` europe scores well on some of the measures characterising an oca '' . 
  it may be consensual that the euro zone is n't a perfect currency area , but not that it 's bad one . 
  the article you linked brings nothing new , the one i previously referenced also stated that krugman has been claiming to know the oca theory better than the guy who wrote it . 
  it would n't be the first time krugman is overconfident that he knows better ( i 'm thinking of krugman vs keen ) . 
  i 'd say one reason is that he 's too `` progressive '' to be `` centre-right '' ( e.g. 
  bayrou ) , so he 's `` centre-left '' by comparison . 
  you 're assuming that people view directly elected parliaments as democratic ... 
  the brain drain would still happen without the eu 's freedom of movement . 
  unless you literally use force to prevent people from leaving , they can always relocate somewhere else the old-fashioned way : by getting a work visa . 
  * edit : plenty of young french citizens have moved to canada in the past decade , you 're going to blame that on the eu 's freedom of movement too ? 
  as i recall merkel was ready to let greece leave at the height of the crisis . 
  it was others who kept pushing for a deal . 
  you should be able to confirm that by sifting through what was written at the time , e.g. 
  [ greek debt crisis : deal reached after marathon all-night summit - as it happened | business | the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live ) . 
  also , i do n't see how germany could stop greece from leaving . 
   a currency union wo n't work without a proper fiscal union robert mundell , a pioneer of the [ optimum currency area theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) , somewhat disagrees with you . 
  in 2012 he said : [ euro is here to stay ] ( http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/robert-mundell-euro-is-here-to-stay ) . 
  quote :  he dismisses the claims of critics who say that the euro was a mistake because europe is not a fiscal union . 
  `` very few countries in the world have a fiscal union . 
  it would be almost impossible for a large country to have a complete fiscal union . 
  canada and the united states do not . '', 
  debt-to-gdp is definitely a simplistic indicator , but i have n't seen any alternative yet , and it 's still widely used including in the eu 's mip scoreboard . 
  the problem with changing the schedule for debt repayment is that it does n't change the debt-to-gdp ratio , which is the indicator that everyone uses . 
  the eu is n't an alliance of wizards who can instantly renovate an entire country with a flick of a wand when it joins the union . 
  the eu does what it can with the budget it has , and even if it had unlimited resources doing stuff still takes time in the real world . 
  also , romania is of course a net beneficiary of eu funds , we do care and we are helping . 
  i do n't have insider information on negotiations , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  however when i look back at what 's happened in the last years i do n't see any big eu decision that clearly went against france 's interests , it 's simply not true that we 've `` surrendered '' to germany like some people claim . 
  french banks were as exposed to greek debt as the german ones were , so it 's quite normal that france 's position was close to germany 's during the greek crisis , although france seemed to try to help greece a little more . 
  hollande and merkel had somewhat different positions but in the end they always found a common agreement that was sufficiently balanced to be acceptable . 
  unfortunately mistakes were made by both greece and its creditors , resulting in the damage we all know about , but politicians are n't the only ones to blame for that , what they can do is always limited by both external constraints on one side ( e.g. 
  oil price and other global economic conditions ) and on the other side by what their electorates want or refuse ( e.g. 
  most people in northern countries are against cancelling more of greece 's debt iirc ) . 
  there 's also something to be said about economists giving unsound advice to politicians , whether on purpose or because of the sad state of economic `` science '' . 
   when we do n't fulfill ** any ** condition ( debt larger than 60 % , deficit larger than 3 % ) few countries respect the 60 % rule , what matters is moving in the right direction , and we are : the deficit has been decreasing and should be below 3 % soon if all goes well . 
  you can read more about the macroeconomic imbalance procedure [ on the ec 's website ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm ) or [ on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure ) . 
   when unemployment is at 10 % we do n't have many chips on the table unemployment is more a domestic issue than something that weakens us during international negotiations . 
  most people seem to think that merkel is dictating everything and hollande has n't pushed back enough or at all . 
  of course they have no idea what really happens during negotiations , their opinions seem to be based on who appears more in the media , and merkel beats hollande by far in that area . 
  macron is n't a career politician , it 's not completely impossible that he 'd be here in 2022 if he lost 2017 , but i doubt he 's aiming for that .
