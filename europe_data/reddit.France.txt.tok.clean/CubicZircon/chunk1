this is the most recent event , but the one detaching it from the american meaning of `` socialist '' is tours , if not earlier . 
  because it is not a marxist-leninist party , and has fully embraced the republican-democratic form of government since at least the 1920 tours congress ( and thus could have been called a social-democratic party since back then ) . 
  ( this was probably true even earlier , the sfio having always been as attached to political liberty as to economic equality ; but the modern socialists are the direct heirs of those who said a direct non to stalin in 1920 , at the cost of being in opposition for quite some years ) . 
  well i was looking for documentation on this important topic and i found that indeed putin seems so have [ learnt a few tricks from silvio 's book ] ( http://imgur.com/snnl7mn ) . 
  ( sadly , i have been unable to find the same documentation on erdo\u011fan ) . 
  * edit : i found that erdo\u011fan also seems to like [ hot babes ] ( http://imgur.com/za75zjh ) . 
  i thought that to be fucking silvio berlusconi , you had to be a female , and preferably minor ? 
  / gets out, 
  whoa , that straw man is well burnt now , you may stop my friend . 
   that 's a dangerous punishment . 
  the us considers it unconstitutional . 
  it is forbidden , in most cases , by international treaties ( big ones , like the human rights convention ) . 
  thankfully . 
  but we are going to do it anyway . 
  yes , the french * socialists * are going to make a law for citizenship removal . 
  what a sad day . 
  yes , this is a good reason why freedom of speech * for people i like * should be absolute , to be able to call for removing freedom of speech * for people i hate * . 
  - eu - san marino , because it 's cute ( i do n't know anything else about san marino , just wanted to be the first one to quote them ) - east germany , because it still exists , although [ relocated in a warmer place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernst_th%c3%a4lmann_island ) and now quite inoffensive . 
  - iceland ( never been there ) , because is it a european country ? 
  ( ok , that 's not a unique property , but the other contenders were not as nice : turkey , armenia , georgia , russia , greenland , uk ) . 
   and most of the land of current day israel was already owned by the israel foundation . 
  lie . 
  the jewish fund owned only about 1000 km ^ 2 of land , plus about as much privately owned , for a total of about 10 % of the land . 
  -  * busted * [ source ( pro-palestinian website which i mistook it for the jnf itself ) ] ( http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/d/contentdetails/i/2963 ) . 
  so , let us see what happened there a few years ago : refugees from a conflict zone migrated here , established local superiority and confiscated the land . 
  it 's funny how some people hate the refugees when they are brown people ( syrians , afghans etc , ) , support them when they are white people ( germans , poles , etc. 
  ) , yet are not , really not , racist ? 
  and of course the state of the palestinian territories is totally independent from any israeli meddling . 
  this used to be the case also in france ( pr\u00e9sident du conseil , also * informally * prime minister ) until de gaulle in 1958 , where that made one president too many ( pr\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9publique + pr\u00e9sident du conseil is about 1.5 pr\u00e9sident too many for a semi-presidential republic , i hope you follow ) , and the pr\u00e9sident du conseil was retrograded to a mere prime minister . 
  ( fun fact : the pr\u00e9sident du conseil was in the third republic one of the ministers , who assumed the presidency as an extra charge . 
  i do n't know about the fourth republic , but i believe by then he was a `` ministre sans portefeuille '' ) . 
  ( filo pastry filled with feta cheese ) . 
  ( seriously answering a probable joke ) - there is no death penalty in france ( and it will not come back even with terror attacks ) - 124 people * charged * , not proven guilty ( and it is quite probable that the police would have swept very wide , so there are likely a few innocents in the batch ) . 
  the media are actually very much restrained this time - they learnt a bit after the charlie hebdo attacks , where the `` live news '' channels did - publish the name + photo of a suspect before the official police search warrant , - film the police encircling the hostage site ( and the hostage-taker was watching this channel , thus knew where the police was ) , - in the same hostage situation , call and do a live interview with the hostage taker , - and my favourite : during the last stand of the kouachi brothers , they disclosed on tv the presence of a guy hiding in the same building . 
  ( luckily , those two were * not * watching tv and the guy escaped ) . 
  still , you often see persons of east asian ancestry wearing a mask ( looking like a surgical mask ) . 
  this is probably illegal under the niqab law , but strangely people do n't care . 
  ( also , wearing this is actually * very polite * from them , since they do it when they have a cold , to prevent it from spreading ) . 
   i think the swiss burqa-wearing women will be fine . 
  * fined * ftfy ( also , are they swiss , or tourists ? 
  in paris they often say that niqab 'd women are the wives of saudi turist emirs ) . 
   if people want a pornographic community there are plenty of them out there . 
  [ ( or so i heard ) ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/orsoiheard ) < -- risky click of the day , but it 's safe , go ahead, 
  i am old enough to remember when facebook did not exist . 
  ( yes i am ) . 
  i do n't think that the fact that back then , people were not posting calls to violence on facebook , caused them to actually be more violent . 
  where ( and when , if possible ) did this take place ? 
  and most interestingly , even with such loaded questions and all , the figure for muslims is not significantly different from the same figure for non-muslims : the sun ends up shooting their own propaganda in the foot ... 
  on the contrary , the number of [ russian tourists ] ( https://aco.nato.int/new-satellite-imagery-exposes-russian-combat-troops-inside-ukraine ) in turkey will * massively increase * now . 
  thanks for the links !, 
  niqab being about freedom of expression seems to me a basic right ( general rule : freedom of expression is also supposed to apply to things i dislike , which happen to include the niqab ) . 
  the links you posted however are more about the right to choose than the niqab itself ( again , the right to self-determination is also supposed to work for stuff we do n't like ) . 
  only [ 1 to 4 % of our genes at most ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100506-science-neanderthals-humans-mated-interbred-dna-gene/ ) are inherited from the first europeans . 
  my point here is not really about the neanderthalians ^ ( please eta , note that i did * not * write that the basque are neanderthalians ) , but about the fact that 1 . if we exclude them , then we more-or-less need to define `` first europeans '' as `` first europeans who left a majority of our genome '' , in which case the fact that we did inherit a majority of our genome from them is a tautology , and 2 . the `` first europeans '' question , whether cultural or genetic ( and both cultures and genomes * do * evolve !, 
  ) , is really pointless , since an answer as obviously absurd as `` neanderthalians '' ^ ( or basque ) is technically correct !, 
  then why put the word `` millions '' in there , if not to provoke such a shortcut ? 
   the problem is that there 's a significant segment of the left who 've subscribed to moral relativism so hard they 're defending the niqab as `` female empowerment '' . 
  do you have any source to quote in support of this ? 
  please . 
  rest assured that everybody understood what orban really meant : he does not like brown people . 
  actually , the only candidates for `` true europeans '' are the basque , and even then that 's a flimsy case at most . 
  still , raf , whether funded by ussr or not , is a perfect counter-example of terrorists who are not migrants , thus exposing orban 's lie . 
  apparently , terrorists are supposed to be ~ ~ brown people ~ ~ ( wait , we call them `` muslims '' now , to pretend not being racists ) . 
  note that this also excludes eta , flnc , italian mafia , etc. 
   you can get a rather nice , armored used audi for around 40k eur but be quick to choose . 
  price is expected to go up a bit now . 
  well , the syrian free army confirmed yesterday that there had been so far * no civilian casualties * from the french bombing campaign , so apparently they have been putting a bit more thought on it this time . 
  that picture is definitely not the basilica . 
  the address of the assault ( which i heard on radio this morning ) is about 500 m from the basilica . 
   the majority of the population has `` sans-papiers '' status - meaning they do not yet have a legal status and an id which would allow them to find a job . 
  this is a very bizarre claim . 
  [ citation needed ] !, 
  i was a bit puzzled by your comment and then understood that you probably meant `` policemen or policewomen '' ( and then i wonder if there are any in raid ? 
  well , he certainly did not built the infrastructure himself , and there is a serious point to be made that he mostly used the existing infrastructure ( which was great in germany , and untouched by ww1 ) - cf for example shirer 's * rise and fall of the third reich * . 
  i see this discussion occuring once in a while and i wonder what is so difficult for synchronized attacks ? 
  - you look at the program of stade de france and bataclan to see on which days there are both a match here and a concert there , - maybe you obtain a map of the attack sites ? 
  - the hardest part : you buy some weapons and explosives , - you synchronize your watches , - apparently no need to plan an escape route ( this really would be very hard ) . 
  this looks like something that a few guys with access to basement + pen + paper + innocuous internet searches would be able to do in a few evenings . 
  hey , they can even claim table-top rpgs as an excuse for this !, 
  came here to post this , posted it , then saw that you already did . 
  take my upvote !, 
  also , legalizing ( or at least depenalizing ) drugs should empty a bit the prisons , making them less of a jihad-school , and making it easier to watch carefully the detainees . 
  as trollish as this could be , i think that depenalizing marijuana could be a very great step against this kind of terrorists : - most importantly , it cuts a source of funds ( and hence weapons ) ; - it also empties ( a bit ) the prisons , making it easier to watch carefully those persons held inside ( who would now be the really dangerous ones ) . 
  you are perfectly right !, 
  writing in english in the morning sometimes confuses me ... 
  well , `` near saint-denis '' and `` in saint-denis '' are two very different places . 
  moreover , the surrounding district , somewhat confusingly called `` seine saint-denis '' , is not ( on average ) the most pleasant of places . 
  if you dressed like an amerindian to spill your tea , then yes , it is undoubtedly america 's fault . 
  username checks . 
  it is really easy to access from downtown paris and has the funeral basilica of the kings of france ( none of which are actually still buried there since the r\u00e9volution - maybe louis xviii ? 
  ) , but the crypt still holds all the statues ( making this a very rare example where you can see the various styles as they were made , not collected in a museum ) . 
  and the basilica itself is very nice ( it is one of the very first gothic churches , you can also see the progression of style between the oldest and newest parts of the nave ) . 
  the city around it , while containing nothing else `` touristy '' ( maybe stade de france ? 
  ) , is a quite nice place ( i used to work here ) that feels like an actual downtown and not a gloomy suburb like we have so many of . 
  one of the last times i visited the city , there was a marriage in the basilica . 
  both the bride and groom were obviously afro-french ( is that a word ? ), 
  and the priest had the thickest vietnamese accent i ever heard . 
  seeing this marriage taking place right above the kings of france was glorious :-), 
  ( now this is much better than a stupid comparison , thanks !, 
  i dream of a sub where we would upvote `` this is an actual idea , even if i disagree with it '' and downvote `` this is a lame analogy , even if i agree with it '' , but / r/europe is no such sub ) .
