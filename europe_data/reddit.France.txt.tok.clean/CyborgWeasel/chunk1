  asia is probably the next center of power so please , do n't be assholes . 
  well , i ca n't find a source either . 
  i 'm sure i read a story about italian soldiers surrending to kingdom of france by waving our flag but , as soon as i search for `` white flag '' `` surrender '' and `` french '' , you 'll guess what i found . 
  see you coming , you all  :-[ . 
  the flag of france was plain white as a sign of purity , it was used by defeated army as a sign of reddition to the french kingdom . 
  it was n't used by french army as a sign of reddition , it was used by french army as a sign of `` * we 'll - kick-your-ass-so-hard-you 'll - use-it-for-the-next-three-century * '', 
  england looks good , from afar . 
  scare people by playing bad clown , ok , but scaring a 6yo kids with a knife like it happened , it goes really too far . 
  how is dexia still failing at those test after french taxpayers have paid 6.6 billions $ to bail them out and belgians even more ? 
   i 'm a left-wing souverainist you mean you are a nationalist socialist ? 
  because we are very bad and we give them food [ not spicy enough ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20141007/calais-migrants-food-spicy-reject ) . 
  the next step is to not give them dessert anymore , they 'll swim to england if necessary !,

  wtf , we had a 12m-high fire-breathing dragon robot and we 're giving it ? 
  f *** diplomatic ties , we do n't even like china , we 're keeping it !, 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iubssldxc0 ), 
  how were his teeth ? 
  do we have to read this as `` poland will sign with thales if the mistral deal is canceled '' ? 
  anyway , it is the same story since weeks . 
  poland threatens saying it does not , russia say the deal is signed and france does n't say anything . 
  it wo n't change for a few weeks yet . 
  [ news in english ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/business/jean-tirole-wins-nobel-prize-in-economics.html?emc=edit_na_20141013&amp;nlid=58795525&amp;_r=1 ), 
  yup , except for hard sciences , nobel prize is biaised . 
  but now , anything he says that is n't what politicals said will be interpreted as a critic . 
  his works is on regulator policies whereas now our government says we have to deregulate to foster competition . 
  i love french fries . 
  i was expecting our aa to be downgraded do aa - or a + , so i think it 's not that bad . 
  anyway the anglo saxon world does not understand france so it 's totally typical of british press . 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/11150306/german-model-is-ruinous-for-germany-and-deadly-for-europe.html ) : they say france will be the dominant power of continental europe within year . 
  not just continental , eh !, 
  put on tolls and profit ? 
   i 'm really hoping peugeot is successful so we can maybe see renault over here . 
  i doubt it , at best you will have renault with a nissan logo . 
  peugeot do n't make any sense in its relation with citroen and it will be even worse with ds : peugeot dreams to be the one making the nice luxury car , they want to be as if audi owned vw or alfa owned fiat . 
  they do n't understand their branding his to build little sport and cheap cars for young people ( -  205 gti ) citroen has older customers , with more money so they should be making better car . 
  it 's so stealthy the camera ca n't make a clear picture . 
  8 ) neuron is an experiment , it will not be produced like that , it 's made to developp skill and cooperation to build a real attack drone in the future . 
  clearly , jumping back in nato integrated command was a really bad move . 
  we should have stayed like de gaulle wanted : friends , allies but non-aligned and with an army able to guarantee our independence . 
  being too much in nato put us in a `` comfort zone '' that leads us to slack off . 
  : / also , an army in good shape create a lot of jobs and allow the states to make big investments in industry , which would be a good thing now . 
  they 're not point in recognising a terrorist state .

  a strong currency is great when you 're selling mercedes and bmw , it 's not when you 're selling fiat and renault . 
  austerity do n't reduce deficits anyway . 
  random us crap pop you can hear everywhere and random [ french ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byvp2s_bd0e ) [ crap ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2o3bagjedi ) [ rap ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ydeyu61pii ) you can hear nowhere else . 
  far right did n't win this election , random normal right did . 
  jmlp did n't say holocaust never happened , he said it was `` a detail in history '', 
   long-term it 's stupid on french part because right now poland and eastern european countries will be the states buying the most weapons in eu i 'm really not sure about that . 
  russians ' military budget is growing fast . 
  they probably could have made similar ships alone . 
  they reached out to us for help and our stupid head of state is delaying the ships . 
  we wo n't get anything from russia with this kind of politics . 
  they are also doing it with russians 's rubles . 
  it 's not huge for $ , it is for $ , in a bad way . 
  surrenders to what exactly ? 
  if you want to make a joke , try at least to make sense . 
  the france will not bow to everything poland say just because you 're paranoid against russia . 
  unsure it persuades anyone to stop coming here . 
  russia is not an enemy to us . 
  even if we disagree with its politics , russia is not a threat for france . 
  we are just back in ( 2009 ? ), 
  nato military integrated command after withdrawing from it because we did n't want french soldiers under us commandment . 
  that 's why we developed our own nuclear weapons . 
  delay the delivery of this ship was really yet another stupid idea from hollande . 
  he should have either deliver it asap to not let the controversy swell ( < - & i stand this one ) or cancel it . 
  poland 's threat should n't weigh anything , they never bought us anything , it 's as if i threatened ferrari to not buy their cars whereas i never did . 
  3000 deaths trying to cross the sea , how many trying to cross the desert ? 
  : /  `` it is time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants , '' swing told reporters on monday . 
  yup and the solution is, 
   any victory is good to get . 
  not sure there are reasons to be proud here ... 
  hum , basically you 're admitting you are stealing our money ? 
  we invaded swiss ? 
  damned , i 'm sorry , it 's like invading canada . 
  yay nuke !, 
  so much better than solar energy !, 
  islamic terrorim existed way prior military action from 10 years ago in irak and afghanistan if that 's what you 're implying . 
  war against terrorism has prevented attacks like those in new york to occur again . 
  i do not think it 's ineffective . 
  whenever paris is polluted , it 's never paris ' fault . 
  it 's either dust of german 's industry , ashes of iceland 's volcans or fertilizers in the fields flying up there . 
  fun fact , it never pollutes any other town , just paris .
