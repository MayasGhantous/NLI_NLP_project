  it 's really bad luck . 
  no , he 's an hoodlum , but he is not dangerous . 
   i really do hope the f35 is a big success f35 is already a failure , russian 's sukhoi t50 is a better fighter and it 's not a good time to be behind russia . 
  also , we happen to have helicopter landing ship to spare if you want some . 
  yup , i 'm sure they will be happy when they 'll learn that share the burden with italy , spain and greece will means they 'll have to welcome even more asylum seeker . 
   maybe they will take some of ours from calais too . 
  i remember when gaddafi was a son of a bitch . 
  and i really like uk with a wrung neck , it suits you well . 
   what is the smallest note in the euro currency ? 
  we 've got 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 $ . 
  the bigger one are rarely used here . 
  they were made for the germans who pay everything in cash . 
  it 's done on purpose , is n't it ? 
  i do not understand how that can happen , an intern with google maps can put the right country at the right place . 
  did n't get why we need a arabic word to talk about them . 
  we are not using a german word to talk about germany or a japanese one to talk about japan . 
  tuvalu , we need more tiny country . 
  not sure about that . 
  hollandinou had no opposition so far , but with someone in front of him , especially someone as cleaving sarko , its popularity will probably rebound . 
  i know summer are short up there but is n't it strange to celebrate * mid * summer day 3 days after the beginning of the summer ? 
  11 holiday in france , 6 religious , 5 civil : * jan 1st : new year 's day * may 1st : labour day * may 8th : nazy germany capitulation * jul 14th : bastille day * aug 15th : assumption of mary * nov 1st : all saints ' day * nov 11th : armistice 1918 * dec 25th : christmas * varying : easter monday * varying : feast of the ascension * varying : pentecost just 3 in common with you it seems : new year 's day , christmas and november 11th . 
  yup , we will finally help you find those wmd . 
  so , following the same logic , those migrants in calais are uk 's fault and not france 's ? 
  thousands previous death did n't change anything . 
  we 've got both , france baise ouais !, 
  serbia , of course !, 
   it 's really a complicated situation all that makes it rather simple imho . 
   and then they have the guts to call those people as criminals ( ... ) well , [ when you look at it ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_piff_does_money_make_you_mean ) , statistically ... 
   france should be doing the same to italy . 
  italy is no longer in control of the situation because migrants are too numerous to be retained . 
  sent them back from our territory to our neighbour like uk is doing would be selfish and not effective . 
  there 's no point in clearing a problem at the border between france and uk to create exactly the same at the border between france and italy . 
  entry point country are responsible for monitoring the borders of the schengen area , uk is responsible for its policy who 's attracting migrants while denying them entry into its territory . 
  neither are france 's responsibility . 
  na , we ca n't put them in jail , they have to go in a detention centre but our detention centre are totally full . 
  and they ca n't be deported without a trial , wherever they came from . 
  it takes years . 
  legally , we 're supposed to put them back in the country by which they did enter ue . 
  but it is a stupid things to do : that 's what uk is doing , they just put them back in calais and then they are all surprised that there is so many migrant in calais ... we 're supposed to send them back in italy but italy is already drowning under the task . 
   these are things you can get arrested for , at least here . 
  even if they are arrested , and put in custody , it 's only temporary . 
  they should be put in a detention centre ( [ centre de retention administrative ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_de_r%c3%a9tention_administrative_en_france#conditions_d.27h.c3.a9bergement ) ) but we do n't have enough for them . 
  there is already a ton of expulsion each year ( 27.000 in 2013 ) . 
  in an ideal world , they would get arrested and dealt with at their entry point but italy , spain and greece ca n't do it because they are too many . 
  france is not an entry point , it 's an `` exit point '' . 
  calais is nothing but the main symptom of a larger problem there are two things that need to be done : * uk needs to adapt its policy to stop attracting half of africa and asia in europe . 
  * entry country need assistance to deal with all these people and changes in laws governing deportation to make the process faster . 
  well , if it is a reason to leave the ue , then everybody can leave : they are passing through a lot of country to get there . 
   deport them where ? 
  they usually do n't have documents - and this is an issue for france too . 
  thank you . 
   the problem is that france is dealing with it by just passing them along to another neighbor . 
  na , france have something like 350.000 illegal immigrants on its territory , tens of thousands more each year , thousands are deported . 
  we are drowning in the task and higher barrier wo n't solve anything . 
  why is n't england deporting them actually , instead of asking france to do so ? 
  * sigh * same things over and over . 
  so again :  they should be detaining these people you ca n't detain people without a trial . 
  that goes against basic humans ' right . 
   if their first entry into the eu was through france france is nearly to ** never ** their entry point in europe : their is literally thousands of people dying each year trying to go from africa to lampedusa in their shitty boats . 
  it 's 130km . 
  africa -  spain by strait of gibraltar is 20km turkey -  greece by lesbos island is 20km going from africa to france by boat is almost ** 700km ** . 
   they should be processed and given asylum if needed , or deported if not . 
  it 's procedure , with summons , appeals , etc. 
  it takes a lot of time , they ca n't be detained during the procedure , they ca n't be given asylum if they 're not asking for it . 
  what is this fairground ride they 're doing ? 
  who 's planned the road ? 
  it just make easier for migrants to hop in the trucks : /, 
   without a un mandate air strikes on another country are an act of aggression . 
  not sure about that . 
  irak asked for help , i do n't believe we need a un mandate in this situation . 
  as when we sent our army to mali , the malian government asked us to do it . 
  ozone actually , o-zone was a [ moldovan band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrx5praludy ) . 
  :p great news , that 's millions of cancer that are avoided . 
  ok , cool , but are they smarter because of this ? 
  again . 
  because laws . 
  to be deported you have to be deportable . 
  if you are deportable you have to be judged , with a right to defense . 
  and then if you are convicted you need to have a right to appeal . 
  it takes a lot of time . 
  you ca n't just put people in camp without trial and fired them off the country nowadays . 
  our defence minister , le drian , think that will should act in libya . 
  since we 've got a brand new `` government of cohesion '' i can not imagine that it 's just empty words , we will probably go fight over there in a few weeks . 
  who 's coming ? 
  it would be an empty threat : stepping out of eu is one of fn goal . 
  where is the doublespeak in that ? 
  it seems perfectly clear to me . 
  aka `` oouuhh , support me , if you do n't our country will become a fascist dictature , be afraid , be afraid ... '', 
   that statement has no base . 
  yeah , sure , albanian mafia kidnapping serbs girls for prostitution , organ theft with only serbs victim , anti serb riot , everything is fine in kosovo ... 
   under sarkozy why `` under sarkozy '' ? 
  this offence was created in 1945 and is not yet repealed . 
  do not support it because i think kosovo is basically a mafia state . 
  it looks like serbian have a part of their land kidnapped by albanian mafia . 
  if albanian in kosovo did n't want to be in serbia , they should have gone to albania instead of declare independence . 
  yup , that sort of thing is usually [ super efficient ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4qot7w8uuk ) . 
  you embarrass all europe there , rosbeef , calm down a little . 
  we can never trust you to behave properly . 
  i meant the strait of gibraltar , not the british oversea territory . 
  they are all here illegally but they burned their documents or do n't have any .
