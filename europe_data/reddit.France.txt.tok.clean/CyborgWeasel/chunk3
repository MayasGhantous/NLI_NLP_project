  most or the time we do n't know where to send them . 
  also , european law forbid us to deport them without a lot of procedure . 
  nop , ame is for illegal immigrants and their children , [ cmu ] ( http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/couverture_maladie_universelle ) is for the poor . 
  http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aide_m%c3%a9dicale_d'%c3%89tat 540 millions $ in 2009, 
  yet . 
  i ca n't see how this can end well . 
  illegal immigrant welfare cost us nearly a mistral each year . 
  actually , they 're not asking for asylum in france so we should n't have to give them asylum . 
  they 're coming here passing by either gibraltar , italy or greece . 
  we are controlling our border , if we did n't they would be in dover , not in calais . 
  yeah , a ceasefire , so we can sell the mistral to russia now ? 
  scoop for you : dicature spend a lot buying weapons each year . 
  scooper scoop for you : we 're selling a lot of weapons to a lot of dictature each years . 
  scoopest of the scoop : your country is doing the same thing . 
  what i meant was :  assuming this move does n't make us lose some future contracts i 'm afraid that we will lose some contracts . 
  raw truth : we are selling a ton of weapon , each year , to of lot of dictature all over the world . 
  if they 're afraid they do n't get their stuff , they 'll simply buy from someone else ( uk , usa , or russia )  it 's 5billions more on our balance of trade our balance of trade was already in deficit last year and the year before , and the year before , etc. 
  if we get 5billions $ penalty to pay to russia , we will simply have 5 more billions of deficit . 
  it 's not totally unbearable . 
  600 millions $ each , but there 's penalty for not delivering . 
   we 're not the ones selling arms to the eu 's number one most hostile and dangerous neighbour . 
  when did you stop actually ? 
  nop , * assuming this move does n't make us lose some future contracts * , it 's 5billions more on our balance of trade . 
  it was 67billions in 2012 , 61 in 2013 . 
  it 's bad but we can handle it . 
  consequences are for saint nazaire 's shipyard who will need some ( european ? ), 
  help . 
  france billions : -5 saint-nazaire 's shipyard employment : -1000 and you 'll see , next time an european country wants some jet fighters they will bought f-35 :p, 
  or just the opposite , mistrals can be used as hospitals :p, 
  those two ship worth 1.2 billions $ , total weapons sales last year were 6.3 billions and i read somewhere penalty 's for not delivering are 5billions $ . 
  we ca n't sell them to anyone , they 've got part coming from russia ... 
  it 's huge but i really do n't think it 's really that huge actually , that 's `` just '' 5billions . 
  i do n't think our economy is more in danger today than yesterday . 
  i 'm more worried about our last shipyard , '' [ les chantier de l'atlantique ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chantiers_de_l%27atlantique ) '' ( and for the guys working there ) they 'll probably need some state 's help , let 's see if ue do n't deem it as unfair competition ... 
   buying rafales when you got typhoons is like buying a 208 when you got a golf . 
  duh , rafale is better than typhoon . 
  it beat the crap out of it in each test made . 
  rafale has even beat the f22 . 
   the former red arrows team leader -- peter collins -- stated rafale as a `` war-fighter par excellence '' . 
  he added that he deemed the rafale to be the best and most complete combat aircraft that he had ever flown . 
  he concluded in saying that if he had to go into combat , on any mission , against anyone , he would , without question , choose the rafale . 
   in another aircraft exercise in the uae , even the f-22 raptor , a fifth generation fighter , could hardly do anything to `` tame '' rafale . 
  according to jean-marc tanguy 's information , defence journalist , the balance sheet lies in the figures hereafter :  dogfighting ( with rafale weapons system 's performance lowered on purpose ) : faf rafales vs raf typhoons : 4 -- 0  dogfighting with further rafale weapons system reduction : faf rafales vs raf typhoons : 3 -- 1  final balance sheet ( in both scenarii the rafales did not have full weapons systems ... ) : faf rafales vs raf typhoons : 7 -- 1 [ source here and all over the interweb ] ( http://www.theworldreporter.com/2012/04/eurofighter-typhoon-vs-dassault-rafale.html ) french 's industry  rest of europe 's industry france baise ouais !, 
   france can still relay upon its former colonies :d china is taking over africa , most of gulf of guinea is already lost , who will we exploit then ? 
  not opposed . 
  i want them to pay as we are and engage in peacekeeping operations and war against terrorism all over the world . 
  they would see how expensive it is and stop bragging about all the money they 've got . 
  :p also , they could buy us some rafale and even one or two mistral . 
  yup `` stylo \u00e0 bille '' is the official term but `` bic '' is often used . 
  yeah !, 
  gib money , will take care , promise !, 
  the matter is : we are not selling warships to russia , we have sold them , 3 years ago . 
  if putin wanted them now , i really do n't think we would do it . 
  welln that 's not the hardest part : mistral are badly armored , any anti-ship missile or even a bombing attack like the one on [ uss cole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_cole_%28ddg-67%29 ) can sink them . 
  they have to be escort by corvettes or frigates . 
   russia is a third world country .

  renault is supposed to be n \u00b0 1 in france since well ... 
  since anybody bothered counting . 
  maybe they took psa ( peugeot + citroen ) found [ this ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/auto-addict/actualites/les-10-marques-ayant-vendu-le-plus-d-automobiles-en-france-en-2012-02-01-2013-1607867_683.php ) , in 2012 : * renault ( 343.000 ) * peugeot ( 305.000 ) * citroen ( 266.000 ) * vw ( 155.000 ) * ford ( 92.000 ) * dacia ( 81.000 ) * opel ( 72.000 ) * nissan ( 70.000 ) * toyota ( 68.000 ) * audi ( 62.000 ) ** edit : ** huh , just reread it : ** `` brand of top selling car '' ** not ** `` top selling brand '' . 
  ** it 's renault clio in france in 2013 . 
   our air force is sporting f16s , f35as ( 2 test planes at the moment , will be expanded once the product is actually finished ) , again , the most advanced in the world f35 is nowhere currently , dassault 's rafale is better , more reliable and cheaper ( which is a feat for it ) . 
  the only reason to buy f35 is to lick us ' boots . 
  what 's the relationship ? 
  and what are we supposed to do with those ship anyway ? 
  that 's not really what i would call neutrality then ...

  humm ... france 's second highest peaks is the ... mont blanc de courmayeur ( 4748m ) . 
  okay , you all know that italy and france disagree on their border in this area . 
  france think is mont blanc ( 4810 ) is all in france whereas italy think the mont blanc is the border . 
  it 's the same thing with mont blanc de courmayeur , italy think is all in their land and france that it is the border . 
  until this `` dispute '' is resolved , i think it 's safer to say that [ mont maudit ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/mont_maudit.jpg ) ( litteraly `` cursed mountain '' ) is our second highest point ( 4465m ), 
  naa , there 's no need to freak out , it 's just that 's if you look at where are the conflict in europe 's surrounding , you end up with something like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/jlr8dhe ) , but everything is ok , really .

  norway is in the middle between in and out the eu . 
  they probably wo n't change soon because they can use this position to make a lot of money by being an entry point for some goods in the eu like bioethanol for example . 
  i want to thank germany to replace us in the position of the most arrogant country , i also want to say to all of you that we do n't like you either .
