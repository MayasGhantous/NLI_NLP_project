  and , above all , i want to lol a britain for they 're seeing themselves as most compassionate . 
  you ca n't even start to understand how furious i am about this . 
  putin is messing with europe since years , and nobody is doing anything . 
  every year we lower our military budget as if we could raise it again tomorrow . 
  that 's stupid , each equipment we did n't buy all those years is going to miss in the coming month . 
  also , it makes me furious that we 've got our soldiers in fucking africa instead of protecting europe . 
  we should have put aircraft carrier and boats in black sea as soon as it started . 
  we should have put soldiers in estonia instead of usa doing it , we should n't be hiding once again behind usa and nato . 
  eurovision is not gay , it 's manly , and hairy and all . 
  afaik ( and it 's not really far ) vega is really small but big enough for galileo . 
  the main problem would be that it 's really new , actually i think it 's still in test . 
  the firsts launch for galileo was in 2011 which is roughly the same period vega was released . 
  they probably thought it was safer to use soyuz who are old as dust and overall are seen as reliable . 
  for the next launch they simply used the same tech `` do n't fix what is not broken '', 
  ariane 5 is too big for some launch , you do n't use a big truck if you just have few goods . 
  imho , we could have use ariane 4 but it was probably to bought some soyuz than to build ariane 4 and ariane 5 together . 
  naaaahhh , it 's a revolutionary song , you do n't make a peaceful version with little bunny and teddy bear . 
   a lot of urban youth have never seen the milky way in their lives . 
  well , i live in north of france in the red/orange area and i thought for years that pics like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wlvw7g6.jpg ) were totally made up and everybody just saw a big dozen of stars in the sky like me . 
   gold : ** spain **  silver : ** lithuania **  bronze : ** france ** it 's the 3rd title on last 4 eurobasket for spain .

  france , serbia , greece , italy and czech republic will have to dispute a qualification tournament . 
  [ final ranking . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurobasket_2015#final_ranking ), 
   granted , rugby fans are much more respectful than football fans . 
  no , no and no . 
  i really want to know if other country are as bothered as us with `` rugby 's values '' . 
  it 's infuriating how rugby 's fans jump on any occasion to compares their sports to other ( football eu/us ) and claim each time a higher moral ground . 
  it 's consistent with their sport culture : wrestling , judo , weightlifting , rugby , they like `` big guys '' . 
  you can take canada , go europe !, 
  we 've been bad af those last years but i do n't think we 've have fallen that low . 
   this wc is probably happening a little early for us , in one or two years we should be back to normal . 
  maybe . 
  i think . 
  greece and latvia will play against each other for ranking 5th to 8th . 
  spain and france go to semifinal for their annual meeting after euro 2011 , olympics 2012 , euro 2013 and world 2014 . 
  omagad , parker is alive again : o france 40-38 latvia at halftime . 
  last defeat of france vs latvia was 1939 . 
  you know what happened next . 
  spain won in extremis 73-71 !, 
  9 semifinals in a row for spain in eurobasket . 
  one quarter left and greeks defensive tactic is working . 
  they 're leading 57-55 and have a better bench than spain . 
  spain is leading at half-time , with attack and counter-attack whereas greece defend at lot . 
  pau gasol scored 14points and mirotic 12 . 
  there are many greek in the stadium . 
  yup , what 's funny is that people in austria still think they could deport the migrants if germany do n't take them ... 
  surprise , they wo n't !, 
  austria will have to make a lawsuit for each migrant , it will take years and years ... 
   not even going to bother correcting your english . 
  the english part is from google translate , any mistake made is entirely not my fault . 
  why is that platini would speak english when there are people paid to translate ? 
  same for eurovision same at un council same thing in the olympic games , same for the members of each country in the european parliament , apparently the french is not so outdated as that ... *, 
  victory for lithuania , 85-81 !, 
  lithuania games are crazy , will maciulis be elected president or something when he goes back home ? 
  lithuania 39-40 georgia . 
  lithuania , i 'm afraid . 
  82-52 , 22 points for israel in second half time , you did well :p, 
   blade runner soundtrack also , [ conquest of paradise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyedsa4tw0c ) and [ chariots of fire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyjzcuvs_nu ), 
   eva green yes , not overly famous but well-known . 
  she is french and born in paris though . 
  was huge in france , in part thanks to her relationship with alain delon . 
  i do n't know if she is as famous elsewhere . 
  is n't he known worldwide ? 
   marl\u00e8ne mourreau ha , i remember her , she tried to be famous in the 90s by participating to several tv shows and showing her ass and then made some reality shows . 
  it never really worked . 
  of course !, 
  it 's `` chopin '' , not `` chopinsky '' so he 's french !, 
   greece : apparently , before becoming the host of the french x-factor and the voice , nikos aliagas was a real , serious , big journalist in greece . 
  true ? 
  after his worldwide success with [ aphrodite 's child ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2bd9d_aphrodites-child-its-five-o-clock_music ) , demis roussos had a huge career in france : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iolhpic4opa http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1xnlo7_demis-roussos-on-ecrit-sur-les-murs-1989_music, 
  team1 ftw !, 
  final time 80 - 66 , ( 25-11 in the last quarter ) : o, 
  one quarter left , poland and spain are both at 55 points !, 
  tv prime time ? 
  they will start with a presentation at 8:45 and then the match at 9:00 . 
  latvia will play france or turkey on the next round . 
  greece will play spain or poland . 
  spanoulis woke up , greece is leading by 13 points now . 
  no , wallachia is not qualified sorry . 
  ... romania neither . 
  there were 7 groups of qualifications in august and you had to be one of the first or 6 best second . 
  [ romania was the 7th best second ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurobasket_2015_qualification#ranking_of_second-placed_teams ) . 
  `` nobody wanted to play with them so our mom told us to . '', 
  so we will have a new survey then ? 
  if you annex , then just take french flanders . 
  we 've got money , jobs , a cool big metropolis , a decent football club and a good share of us speak flemmish already ... 
  please let the ch ` ti in france with their 25 % unemployement , immigrant in calais , rc lens , etc. 
  damned san marin , you 're almost not a country , why do you vote grrrr, 
  i was talking about the australian guy , it was just for fun ,
