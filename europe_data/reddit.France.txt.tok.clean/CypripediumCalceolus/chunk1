could n't they put a couple of marshalls and a pc up there , just for a while ? 
  this is just not proper !, 
  italian and spanish . 
  we need to mention the big american chains like mcd and kfc . 
  yes , the artificial flavors they make in new jersy chemical factories give a brief illusion of *** delicious *** , but there is that weird feeling the cardboard in your mouth has hacked your brain . 
  since everybody in business speaks english , you should pick your language for personal reasons , such as where you want to vacation or find a lover . 
  this , of course , means french . 
  something strange in france is so many professionals legitimize homeopathy , and so many people believe it . 
  on the good side , anybody who presents at the er will be treated . 
  family ties are extremely strong and sometimes legally enforced . 
  religious beliefs are highly variable , sometimes lead to severe injury , but are illegal in any medical context . 
  strong bias against industrial and chemical farming . 
  italians are our best/worst friends rivals lovers partners . 
  cooking , fashion , industry , everything . 
  i do n't get it . 
  who has the authority to impose these rules on our government ? 
  german cars are pretty good . 
  at least they are logical and predictable , if you are extremely attentive every instant . 
  meh , a few hours in rome , just to loosen up a little . 
  we had an american licence and needed a french one . 
  the first test was 20 images , each with four choices - who can go , yield , change lanes , and so on . 
  then there is a road test to check if you have control of the vehicle and obey regulations . 
  we both got 20/20 , but the examiner was sceptical , `` americans are sissie drivers . '', 
  when you are a customer , as in a restaurant , shopping center , or toll road , they are typically nice and clean . 
  many towns have public toilets , and these are better than expected . 
  there is also a certain spiteful population who `` go out of their way . '', 
  both deutsches museum and palais de la d\u00e9couverte in paris have a van de graaff static electricity generator , but the demonstrations are a little different . 
  in paris , they ask the prettiest girl with the longest hair to volunteer , and charge her up to make a halo of hair . 
  in munich , they rev the generator up until it discharges a deafening lightning bolt . 
  that being said , dm is generally more impressive with actual boats , trains , rockets , jet planes , and even a mineshaft . 
  we have two daughters in uninversity . 
  one here in france in our nearby city ; she had to scrounge to find affordable housing nearby , comes home on weekends . 
  the other is in berlin , much cheaper and she can easily make her own money working/studying at a hotel desk because of her three languages and the easy job market . 
  next year she will be based in paris and we have no idea how we will find the money . 
  this appears to be just a survey of 80 peoples ' opinions . 
  am i wrong ? 
  `` the survey in its current format has been developed over a period of several years using extensive face-to-face interviews in the usa , and has been pre-tested in the usa , japan and in canada . 
  the survey instrument is designed to elicit wtp for mortality risk reductions to be incurred over 10 years ( effective immediately ) and for reductions in the probability of dying between age 70 and 80 . 
  it has been developed by the members of the project team and under the guidance of a cognitive psychologist , and has relied heavily on the use of the so-called `` think-aloud '' protocol to elicit `` mental models '' of risk perception and its relationship to willingness to pay . 
  the development work for this instrument includes 30 personal interviews , eight focus groups , and two pre-tests involving a total of 80 people . 
  the instrument has been developed in order to tackle problems , in particular insensitivity to the scope of the commodity , that have been found in previous studies . '', 
  the colder the climate , the more hot water you can take without becoming uncomfortably hot . 
  somebody who is hot already but wants coffee needs espresso or even ristretto and beyond . 
  iced coffee exists today , but it 's not traditional because they had no ice back when . 
  citation needed . 
  we know uranium fission is dangerous ( water-cooling is crazy dangerous ) , as are fossil fuels . 
  solar and wind power are growing rapidly , and we would like to see that continue so we can have a less toxic future . 
  let 's keep the republican congress out of european issues . 
  good thing you do n't include american airports , the post would be ten times worse . 
  equal protection and responsibilite of all citizens and residents , not more , not less . 
  do n't forget about going home . 
  check . 
  our kids are trilingual . 
  american dad , french mother , german-speaking kids because european culture is awesome . 
  ya , some hindi and japonise on the side . 
  pretty much typical european these days . 
  our daughter is enrolled in nanterre 's french/german program , two years in berlin , then one in paris . 
  while the two faculties are equivalent in level , paris is far more expensive and less comfortable to live in . 
  if you come into the home of a new or old friend , you can kiss cheeks . 
  at work , you shake hands the first time , mostly kiss afterwards if business is going on . 
  if you do n't wash your car , they will knock on your door and tell you off . 
  we love the new year 's eve singers from austria . 
  how could anybody possibly care ? 
  they all look the same at the end . 
  france - commercial outwards to protect customers ' safety , domestic inwards to welcome guests into the home . 
  at work , when we say `` fine '' it means there is no issue and we want to move on to the next subject . 
  here . 
  whatever today 's governement calls us . 
  true christians have developed since the old times . 
  many of us have become irreligious as european culture has extended arts and literature , improved human rights , developed science , superceded faith with analysis . 
  too good . 
  out of my price range . 
  those fuckers keep fixing , upgrading to luxury status , demanding always , always more money . 
  i just want a fucking decent road that i can afford . 
  to take the family to the lake , we spend more on the auroroute than the gas , which is more than the entry fee , which is more than the car , which is more than our lunch . 
  ok , you feel that . 
  we do n't . 
  americans are running out of resources and influence , the corruption is way out of hand , education is crippling students with debt and ignorance , cops murder , trump is your best shot , so maybe time is up . 
  [ the times , they are a changin ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7qq6_rv4vq ), 
  we are at peak english - it will decline rapidly as translators make language transparent and we can be who we are . 
  in france , grande rue = main street , rue de la gare = train station , , rue du port = harbor , rue de la r\u00e9sistance = i wo n't let them kill me are very common . 
  \u00e9 or \u00e9e probably would be french . 
  monsanto can not be trusted .

  culture is n't ** just ** anything . 
  it 's the civilisation , knowledge , values , and skills transmitted down generations we need to encourage and protect . 
  it is precious and fragile . 
  le monde had an article about this . 
  chinese are not `` investors '' they are conquerors . 
  i never understood why the public does n't own goldman when their net worth went negative and we bailed them out with public money . 
  anybody ? 
  well , yaaa !, 
  torino was part of that whole savoy and florence thing . 
  it was called the ** renaissance ** !, 
  bloodsuckers . 
  if you want a rough idea of what to expect , try google images . 
  paris in winter , prague in winter .
