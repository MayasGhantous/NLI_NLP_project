same goes for trump . 
  and andorra ... 
  well , it can be very geography-dependant . 
  if you take brazil , for example , [ renewable energy sources account for 85 % of the domestic production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renewable_energy_in_brazil ) . 
  and it 's pretty cheap , too . 
  so yes , renewable energy sources are definitely very viable in some places , and this has been the case for a while . 
  unfortunately , some regions do n't have the same natural potential . 
  `` hold on , darling , i 'll just drink this cup of tea and then i 'm all yours ! '', 
  apparently some cartoonist in russia does . 
  i 'm gay and i would n't want to touch that bear with a 10-meter pole . 
  he has unresolved issues and should consider getting out of the closet . 
  also i heard steroids can shrink your weewee, 
  [ there 's reason to think otherwise ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/03/21/want-to-know-the-language-of-the-future-the-data-suggests-it-could-be-french/#17d33f5b3933 ) . 
  edit : `` your language is irrelevant !, 
  '' : 25 upvotes `` maybe it is n't , there are a lot of people speaking it '' : -8 carry on , carry on . 
  like many others , i can not really pick my favorite , so here 's just an example of a song i like ( native language : brazilian portuguese ) : [ maria rita - encontros e despedidas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu6id0u2hga ), 
  `` le vent l'emportera '' is amazing and i also recommend the rest of the album ( `` des visages , des figures '' ) . 
  though it is kind of disturbing how dark it is , especially considering what happened two years after the release of this album ... 
  would you say hollande 's tough stance is new compared to what other politicians would say ? 
  [ something about french taxes , cameron , and a red carpet here ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20120619-uk-france-david-cameron-rolls-out-red-carpet-french-tax-evaders-bernard-cazeneuve ), 
  i 'm not saying bashing the english makes up the majority or even a considerable part of political debates in france ( we mostly care about other things ) , but when the subject does come up , it generally pays off to be tough on them ( from the point of view of politicians ) . 
  you do n't have to do a lot of research to find people in favor of unleashing all the calais migrants on the uk and `` letting them manage it '' . 
  i agree with you that hollande is adopting a candidate-like behavior here . 
  and i do n't expect right wing candidates to be particularly favorable to the idea of either taking the referendum result back or giving the uk favorable trade conditions after the brexit , either . 
  at least everybody seems to agree on that . 
  french politics 101 : whoever spits on the english scores points . 
  especially after the brexit or any other event involving england that may have angered the french population . 
  ( not saying this is my personal view ), 
  especially compared to london . 
  it 's not like the two cities are completely different . 
  like most geographers would agree , i guess . 
  okay , but that 's not geography anymore , is it ? 
  she was just a character in greek mythology . 
  maybe he 'll bring a [ dog ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/12/europe/putin-merkel-scared-dog/ ) . 
  which is an additional great reason to think asia minor is a part of asia and not of europe . 
  i mean , it 's the origin of the name of the entire continent !, 
  it would be weird if it was n't part of it . 
  right , but anatolia is in asia and not the other way around ... right ? 
  i think you may have a controversial subject in the question `` is turkey partly in europe or not ? 
  '' , some say it is n't , some say a part of it is ( istambul and everything this side of the sea of marmara ) , but i think most people agree that * at least * some of turkey is in asia ( i.e. 
  asia minor ) . 
  i mean , it 's in a peninsula called `` asia minor '' . 
   bad luck i guess ? 
  i have the impression a lot of people generalize based on their personal impressions , and since france is a country that attracts a lot of international tourists , every now and then somebody will have a bad experience ( bad luck ? ), 
  and spread the word . 
  then again , i 'm glad people like you will share your good impressions as well . 
  i 've had my fair share of bad experiences in other countries , but i try my best not to accuse millions of people of being unfriendly or whatnot , because i know i 'm being a jerk if i generalize like that . 
  sometimes i do fail , though . 
  actually , i think the neutral option is to disagree with the statement '' * i would n't like to ... * '' . 
  it does n't mean that you * would like to * . 
  other countries with percentages as low as 1 % to see that there is a difference , and cf. 
  other similar questions , such as % of people who would not like to have a person of a different race as a neighbor , etc ) . 
  holy crap , i need to go there one day . 
  so beautiful . 
  the part that really got me was ludwigshafen . 
  why ? 
   percentage of people who would n't like to have people who have aids as neighbours  results up to 84 % d : really guys ... 
  oh , and if random people come to you with something written on a piece of paper and they ask you if you speak english , say something in aramaic and flee . 
  i was also born in a tropical country and i definitely remember my excitement to come to europe for the first time back in 2007 . 
  i hope you have a great time . 
  there 's a lot of good comments here about the cold weather , so i have nothing to add . 
  here 's some france-specific advice : * always remember to say `` bonjour '' if you 're going to talk to somebody . 
  it might seem like a small thing , but it 's really important in france . 
  even if your next sentence is `` do you speak english ? 
  '' , you 're going to score points if you say `` hi '' in french , first . 
  * if you can visit places other than paris , you should definitely do it !, 
  there are many options depending on what you and your family like . 
  * good food is one of the great things about france , but it can be super expensive in paris , and there are a lot of `` tourist traps '' . 
  it might be worth it to have a look on tripadvisor and identify a few restaurants where you would like to go , before you come  * do n't go up the eiffel tower . 
  there 's a ridiculous line to go up , you 're going to be waiting outside ( in the cold ) while being bothered by people trying to sell you cheap tower miniatures and other useless crap . 
  and once you 're up there you realize that the view is kind of disappointing . 
  what you see is paris ... without the eiffel tower ... and shrunk down so you ca n't see the details ... and there might be some fog or rain . 
  avoid it . 
  you want a good view of paris ?

  * the louvre deserves at least one day . 
  * if you can get around paris without using the m\u00e9tro , that 's probably a great idea . 
  privilege walking , taking the bus , renting a bike ... the subway is really depressing . 
  and people call him racist for basically equating mexicans with rapists , among others . 
  hey , you 're already on eurovision . 
  one step at a time . 
  i am naively under the impression that the point of most terrorist attacks in the western world was to indirectly `` recruit '' more isis supporters by creating a tension between muslim and non-muslim populations . 
  and maybe give non-radical muslims an extra push to eventually become radical by increasing that tension . 
  producing a feeling of persecution , of victimization in the local muslim populations and reaping the rewards in the form of young , confused , angry jihadists-to-be . 
  that 's the process , right ? 
  ^ someone ^ tell ^ me ^ if ^ not ^ but ^ please ^ do n't ^ hurt ^ me ^ if ^ i 'm ^ wrong ^ please ^ please ^ :( following that logic , i 'm not sure attacking a mosque ( regardless of differences in doctrine ) would produce that effect . 
  heck , i have crossed the french-german border countless times in the last two years and nobody checked anything . 
  right after the terrorist attacks , too . 
  it was both funny and tragic to watch the government state on french tv that `` border controls were fully re-established '' after the attacks and still be able to do it regularly without the slightest sign of control at the border . 
  one of the biggest `` arguments '' fn-voters have is that `` we have to try something new !!! 1 '' . 
  at least this would stop . 
  ( i 'm not saying i like that scenario , but sarkozy and le pen make me want to puke rather equally ), 
  it 's weird that portuguese begins on the second day ( which is monday , and sunday is the first day but is not called so ) . 
  i believe mandarin is also similar in this aspect . 
  this is getting just spainful now . 
  yes , portugal is green on this map because `` faca '' is definitely the most used word for knife . 
  but if we stretched the concept of knife a little bit , portugal could be red ( cutelo ) or blue ( canivete ) .

  i had an indigestion just by looking at those pictures,
