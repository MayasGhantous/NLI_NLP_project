  * future - french : `` je serai '' ( i will be ) , `` quand je serai '' ( when i am < in the future  ) . 
  portuguese : `` eu serei '' ( i will be ) , `` quando eu for '' ( when i am < in the future  ) . 
  once again , portuguese has different verb tenses . 
  this future subjunctive form is particularly rare in romance languages . 
  french uses the future indicative and english uses the present . 
  good post , just a small remark : i think the ipa character for the `` e '' phoneme in `` les '' is `` e '' , not '' \u0259 '' . 
  the phoneme '' \u0259 '' , or [ schwa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid_central_vowel#mid_central_unrounded_vowel ) , is the way the letter `` e '' is pronounced in `` le '' ( i.e. 
  singular ) . 
  sorry about the nitpicking !, 
  i think he/she misspelled english . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not exactly * beautiful * yet  and considering that a lot of those people going everywhere in france have clearly stated that all they want is to go to the uk , and for that reason they will go through calais ... this might be ugly for a while still : s, 
  well , [ that ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@50.9690743,1.9066944,3a,75y,237.07h,85.02t/data=!3m11!1e1!3m9!1s-cys9ikkpdn4%2fvsophojqudi%2faaaaaaaaab8%2fqitevboy4egrrxgwcvkuivtcxqude0p3gclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-cys9ikkpdn4%2fvsophojqudi%2faaaaaaaaab8%2fqitevboy4egrrxgwcvkuivtcxqude0p3gclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya246.9942-ro0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352!9m2!1b1!2i34 ) was n't difficult at all . 
  well , some of my colleagues here in germany have been in a professional `` team-building '' event in a sauna . 
  i honestly think feeling comfortable around your naked everyday colleagues is a step further than just being around unknown people , and it seemed very german to me . 
  i would certainly have felt weird myself . 
  i do n't get why it is so cool to overtly hate on france . 
  is it really because we can not * communite * ? 
  this [ atrocity ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/54qgjo/croissant_crumbshot_oc/ ) caused a lot of rage on / r/france , but there are many more examples ( pasteurized-milk brie or camembert made in america with cranberries tacked on , wine produced in the us called champagne or burgundy or whatever , etc ), 
  oh wow , thanks for taking the time to write all that !, 
  it 's an interesting read and i learned a number of things . 
  as some people like to say in france , `` i 'll go to bed less stupid tonight '' . 
  also , your english is good enough so do n't apologize for that . 
  i think considering heidelberg to be of a mediterranean weather is kind of a reach , though  . 
  i 've also heard people saying that rheinland-pfalz is basically german tuscany , which also sounds a little bit crazy when you 've been to real tuscany . 
  i mean , the palatinate is beautiful , and there 's wine , and it 's generally warmer than the rest of germany , but it 's still very different than tuscany or other parts of italy . 
  i 've also lived in a mediterranean area in the south of france , and that 's why i was mildly amused at the comparison . 
  also i think germany is an amazingly diverse country , so even if kurpfalz is different , if we joke that it 's not really germany , then i guess we can also exclude bavaria , swabia , saarland , east frisia , and so on ... so what 's true germany ? 
  now you 've piqued my interest : why do you say that ? 
  somebody once told me hd has a quasi-mediterranean weather and therefore is unlike the rest of germany . 
  that was one of those occasions where i was actually the only person laughing  _  edit : spelling is hard, 
  i do n't know . 
  i have observed this during weekdays , and germans in general are pretty disciplined about not getting drunk during the week . 
  it happens all the time , trust me : < source : i live in germany and i find myself being the only person not laughing at a joke * all the freaking time * . 
  i detected your sarcasm particularly in the electric car bit , but the rest kinda makes sense though :p i do n't know if / u/envyone 's response was sarcastic or serious . 
  yes , in france it is common to see a green man on when you 're turning right or left at an intersection . 
  the correct thing to do is to check if there are pedestrians and drive on if there 's nobody around . 
  interesting answers , i thought it was a lot more about avoiding `` teaching kids the wrong lesson '' by showing a bad example , or just to avoid stares/reprimends from other people . 
  where i live ( rhein-neckar area ) people usually behave like that until 10 pm . 
  then you see a lot more jaywalking . 
  i thought this was because kids are not around when it 's late . 
  to be fair , that seems more like a lack of knowledge of geography than politics . 
  just to add to the conversation , in france the mainstream center-left party is the socialist party ( ps ) , which is represented by the current government . 
  a lot of people have even been questioning some of the party is truly left-winged ( e.g. 
  politicians like manuel valls and emmanuel macron have a profile that leans to the center/right at some points , even as members of the `` socialist party '' ) . 
  how we often put an individual person 's rights and well-being above business/company interests . 
  french people do n't just want jobs - we want jobs under conditions that we deem appropriate . 
  ( this is the general impression that i have , but there are some clear exceptions ) . 
  here in germany i have this internal joke with some friends where we say * tsch\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcsss !, 
  * ( `` goodbye ! '' ), 
  instead of the usual * prost !, 
  * when toasting , as a mockery of our own terrible german-speaking skills . 
  if flying is an option , i 'd suggest munich + london + barcelona to visit three must-see places that are also quite different . 
  but that would require a lot of energy and some good planning to be able to enjoy all three cities in just 6 days . 
  if you want something simpler , i 'd go for munich + vienna + prague , which are closer and you can probably just travel by train , which is a lot less stressful . 
  edit : 6 days , not 3, 
  6 days ? 
  that 's not a very long time . 
  are you planning on travelling by plane , by car , by train ? 
  i 'd put vienna , prague , one of strasbourg or lyon , milan in the shortlist , as well as munich itself ( spend 1 day in munich to visit at least the city center and the english garden ) . 
  but if you 're travelling by plane you could probably go farther ( say , barcelona , london , paris ... ) for relatively cheap . 
  yes , you 're right , but if i say something like `` today i 'll go shopping with * mon ami * '' , it 's pretty understandable that i 'm not going shopping with just * a friend * . 
  it 's a clear way to refer to a girlfriend/boyfriend . 
  i 'm a gay person and tend to avoid countries that seem particularly intolerant of lbgt people . 
  right now , it does n't look like i 'd have a great time in russia or in turkey , for example . 
  i 'd prefer to spend my tourist money somewhere else , even though i 'll admit that i 'm unfortunately missing out on a few things ... 
  in addition , compagnon/compagne . 
  or just * mon ami * or * mon amie * , which are pronounced the same way . 
  for that reason , one can not be 100 % of the gender of the person you 're talking about when you say `` mon ami ( e ) '' . 
  as a gay person , i use that when i do n't want to be transparent about it ( sometimes it 's not worth the trouble ) . 
  a little like `` my partner '' or `` my significant one '' in english . 
  native : portuguese fluent : french , english pretty bad : german almost-nonexistent-but-naturally-aided-by-knowledge-of-portuguese : spanish, 
  ludwigshafen area , rheinland-pfalz , germany : not many people . 
  young people are often relatively knowledgeable but really afraid to speak it . 
  old people are sometimes more likely to speak some french than english . 
  it 's also becoming relatively popular in germany . 
  where i live in germany you can find skyr in regular supermarkets , 
  i had a galette burger in rouen this weekend . 
  like a regular burger but instead of buns , they served crispy , 100 % buckwheat mini-galettes . 
  it was really good . 
  i live in rheinland-pfalz and they regularly serve fish with remoulade at the cantine where i work . 
  and sometimes [ storms/cyclones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyclone_xynthia ) , mostly on the west coast . 
  edit : i completely forgot that martinique and guadeloupe are also sometimes affected by hurricanes , like most of the caribbean and the southeast/east of the usa . 
  i think australia is bound to win at some point , because they have a natural advantage : as an outsider , they are significantly less hated by the other countries :p, 
  in some specific areas , yes . 
  let 's say , if you work in a business dealing with foreign customers , it could be important . 
  but i expect that in 99 % of the cases , languages other than english are not * required * . 
  the name `` le figaro '' is also the source of inspiration of our `` the onion '' ( i.e. 
  news satire ) : [ le gorafi ] ( http://www.legorafi.fr/ ) . 
   which areas of southwestern europe have ** violent demographics ** in the streets ? 
   edit : obviously nobody here wants to tell me if there are ** large african & middle eastern migrant/newly-arrived populations ** on the route of my trip , so i 'll try to find something on google . 
  huh . 
  ok . you know what , maybe you should n't come . 
  it 's super violent and non-white around here these days . 
  i 've seen pictures of candy corn on the internet before but never irl . 
  there 's a number of other typical american stuff i would like to try one day , but i can not say candy corn is one of those things ... 
   i ca n't hear the `` another shrimp on the barbie '' joke anymore ... o_o could you please explain that one to me ? 
  edit : thanks !, 
  interesting . 
  i 'm a native portuguese speaker and i think i could easily tell spanish and portuguese apart when their english accents are strong . 
  and i 'm generally able to identify portuguese and brazilian people as such when they speak english .
