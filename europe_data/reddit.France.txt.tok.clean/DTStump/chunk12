  true breton propaganda would tell you to skip the normand cider and stick to good breton cider , 
  acceptable ? 
  sure . 
  do * i * like it ? 
  i do n't like religion and politics getting mixed up , but i dislike unequal treatment even more . 
  we ca n't treat religions unequally and then pretend to be a secular and fair country . 
  may i also suggest [ these ] ( http://thewanderingwanderluster.com/wp-content/uploads/dsc04386.gif ) incredibly creepy statues in prague ? 
  they scared the **** out of me the first time i saw them . 
  admit it , you finnish people have extra-sensitive keyboards . 
  i think it is also a general trend that old people vote more . 
  youngsters will often be very vocal on twitter and whatnot , but they often do n't actually go to the polls . 
  that is why it is generally a good strategy for politicians to sell what the older generations want to buy . 
  i think there are rules that allow border control to some extent between schengen countries , but it should n't be permanent and everywhere . 
  i cross the french-german borders very often and there is some border control , but not all the time , and there are places where it is pretty rare ( e.g. 
  near lauterbourg ) . 
  i have also noticed that border control is more frequent near basel ( france-germany-switzerland , and a lot of traffic ) than near morteau ( france-switzerland and less traffic ) , for example . 
   so the sort of french/italian thing of putting your hand in the air and getting the waiter to come over even though some people do that in france , it 's generally considered a bit impolite to raise your hand . 
  usually just eye contact works . 
  in most restaurants ( non-fancy ones ) , it 's also ok to just go to the counter to pay if you do n't want to wait for an opportunity to ask for the bill and then wait some more until the waiter comes back with it . 
  i have worked as a waiter in france in the past , in `` filler jobs '' between my master 's degree and phd . 
  needless to say , i was not the best waiter ever because i have n't had proper education on that . 
  i liked doing it though , and made a lot of effort to compensate my lack of training . 
  as some background info , in france , it is not * required * to tip the waiter , as the payment for the service is supposed to be included in the bill already . 
  this is not the case in germany and other countries , for example , where by default you add about 10 % to the bill as a tip . 
  therefore , if you go to a french restaurant and you 're satisfied , but not overly enthusiastic about the service , it 's perfectly fine not to leave a tip . 
  i really appreciated the tips i got as a waiter mostly because of the gesture of recognition ( even because i never really depended on that money , it was not supposed to be my career ) . 
  i was perfectly satisfied with a day of service without any tips , as long as the customers seemed satisfied somehow . 
  in my view , when tips are mandatory , you lose some of that . 
  it 's not just a `` thank you '' : customers are * supposed * to tip if the service was at least ok , or they 're jerks . 
  the value of the tip as a gesture of appreciation is diminished , it just becomes business as usual . 
  besides , in some countries where the tip is a fundamental part of the job , the base salary is not enough : that is the image that i get from the us . 
  being a waiter without tips would be a terrible job , and to me that is not ok . to me , the job is already something that 's pretty tough , and it 's not very humane to enable the possibility of suppressing a significant part of the income of a worker just because the customers are not tipping that well . 
  if the waiter is bad or unfriendly , an employer can choose to fire him ; however , i do n't think the income of the worker should be dependant on mood fluctuations or on the generosity of the customers . 
  then again , i do recognize that this is a very cultural thing . 
  as a lot of french people , i tend to be more in favor of protecting worker 's rights than the average american , and the case applies here . 
  edit : english is hard, 
  yup !, 
  ( that 's the kind of god i can * get behind * ) . 
  let 's say i 'm more likely to have pictures of naked rugbymen on my walls than a religious symbol . 
  born in sa here . 
  in my experience a lot of people have stated they do n't consider it part of the western world . 
  then again , it 's not the east either . 
  whatever . 
  i 'm currently living in germany and i 'd like to move back to france as soon as i can find a suitable job , which could take a while :|, 
   combining an abundance of resources with a low population density almost always means that a country will have a good economy and rich citizens . 
  taking a look at [ this list on wikipedia ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_density ) i have to confess i see no pattern at all that would support that statement , particularly the part where you say `` almost always '' . 
  i also like ha\u00dfloch ( `` hate hole '' ) , even though i know the name of the city is supposed to come from `` hazelnut forest '' or something like that . 
  here 's some more : * monteton ( kinda like `` my nipple '' ) * bourr\u00e9 ( `` drunk '' ) * la baffe ( `` the slap '' ) * corps-nuds ( `` naked bodies '' ) * tr\u00e9con ( sounds like `` really stupid '' ) * chatte ( `` pussy '' ) * pauvres ( `` poor people '' ) * soupir ( `` sigh '' ) * glaire ( `` phlegm '' ) * moisy ( sounds like `` moldy '' ) * le cercueil ( `` the coffin '' ) * mouais ( '' ... yeah ... '' ) * montchaton ( a little like `` my kitten '' ), 
   that said , when traveling in france i prefer to speak english , it 's often better to come off as american than have people pretend they ca n't understand me and tell me to speak real french . 
  wow ... 
  i feel sorry about that . 
  i 've met a few qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in france and had no idea this could happen to them . 
  i also have an unusual accent as i was born and grew up in brazil , but people never really bothered me about that . 
  my feeling is that french is closer to the `` connected '' size of the spectrum , whereas portuguese is closer to the opposite side as you say , at least from the brazilian perspective . 
  it is not unusual to have belgian or canadian french-speakers on french tv , for example . 
  there 's also a fair amount of effort to keep things [ interconnected ] ( http://www.francophonie.org/ ) . 
  for german , i think things may be more [ compartmentalized ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/alltagssprache-bulette-oder-frikadelle-bolzen-oder-kicken-a-1109490.html ) than stated in the op , with considerable differences among local dialects that are geographically close . 
  now kiss !, 
  i do n't know about corsica , but i 've stopped at 2 kisses in some places before , only to have people tell me `` oh , here you 're supposed to kiss 4 times !, 
  '' , so the house rules should definitely apply to outsiders as well :p, 
  indeed . 
  i always tilt my head to the left as i approach the person to avoid directional misunderstandings  _ , 
  oh my , i did n't even know about the 5 kisses in corsica . 
  crazy . 
  in addition the number of kisses can go up to three or even four ( ! ), 
  depending on your region . 
  why do those regions hate prague and bohemia ? 
  just curious . 
  but that 's like calling the netherlands `` holland '' , right ? 
  because bohemia is not the whole czech republic . 
  there are a lot of memes based on movies , particularly quotes from certain comedy movies . 
  one that is very well-known is [ la cit\u00e9 de la peur ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109440/ ) . 
  it is just this sequence of very memorable scenes that even people who have n't watched the movie know ( think `` luke , i 'm your father ! '', 
  - even somebody who has never watched star wars has probably heard of that ) . 
  one of my favorite memes coming from that movie is this guy who always throws up when he 's happy . 
  every once in a while somebody will say at a party `` i throw up when i 'm happy , and i 'm ecstatic right now !, 
  '' , then everybody will laugh like it 's some internal joke the whole country knows about , and it there 's a foreigner in the group that person will probably scratch their head . 
  probably portugal because of my own origins as well as the great food , landscapes , weather , history ... 
  bahahaha . 
  * what 's your favorite syphilis ? 
  * i snorted . 
  ever since i moved to germany i 've been buying tea at [ this place ] ( https://www.teegschwendner.de/en/ ) . 
  but i 'm not really a specialist and i like drinking weird flavors that would probably make purists cringe . 
  depardieu should be your goalkeeper so nothing goes through even if he does n't move at all :d just make sure to put a few bottles of vodka next to the goal so he does n't get bored and leave . 
  interesting , i 've also heard something similar for brazil ( * 200 million national team coaches * ) . 
  the closest thing i can think of is '' * faire la mouche du coche * '' ( `` to be like the coach 's fly '' ) , which is not a very common expression . 
  it comes from a la fontaine fable called `` the coach and the fly '' ( [ english version here ] ( http://www.lafontaine.net/lesfables/fableetr.php?id=843 ) ) , which tells a story about six horses dragging a coach around and this annoying little fly basically shouting orders and bothering the horses to work harder . 
  eventually the coach reaches its destination and the fly is all `` yeah , you can pay me now for all the work that i 've done , kthxbai '' . 
   because r/europe tend to be very critical of refugees as a whole in my opinion , you should n't be afraid of people criticizing your friend 's initiative . 
  leaving the country is probably the best decision for your friend , even though it might not be an easy one , and who are we to question that ? 
  now , criticizing our governments ' policies with regards to refugees , that 's something else . 
  our politicians should not * encourage * refugees to come if our asylum seekers are going to have their requests denied and then stay in the streets , completely aimless . 
  my view is that you can rarely really blame the individual refugee . 
  you can and should , however , be critical of governments mishandling the overwhelming demands . 
  we can either be capable of hosting refugees , and then manage it properly , or not be able to , and properly control the inflow . 
  when our politicians encourage refugees to come when we ca n't handle so many , we have a problem . 
  but it should n't be a crime for an individual person , or something to be frowned upon , to actively seek a better/safer life . 
  sometimes , that means leaving the country . 
  that 's what many of us would do in that situation . 
  fr : * `` querelle d'allemand '' - * a german 's dispute * , or an argument over something small , unimportant * `` les anglais ont d\u00e9barqu\u00e9 '' - * the englishmen have disembarked * , ... to have your period ... clearly referring to the red uniforms * `` travail d'arabe '' - * an arab 's work * , or something that 's poorly done .
