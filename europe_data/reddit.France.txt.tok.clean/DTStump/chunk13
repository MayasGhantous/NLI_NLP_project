  this expression is becoming less common because it 's kinda racist * `` de l'h\u00e9breu / du chinois '' - * hebrew / chinese * , basically something that 's difficult to understand bonus - pt : * `` para ingl\u00eas ver '' - * for the english to see * , something that 's designed to look great but it 's all fake * `` despedir-se \u00e0 francesa '' - * to say good-bye the french way * , which is basically like spanish ( irse a la francesa ) or the french `` filer \u00e0 l'anglaise '' * `` um neg\u00f3cio da china '' - * a chinese deal * , or a great deal/opportunity, 
  okay , i 'd have some of that , but it still does n't make my top 10 , 
  we have similar tastes , a mature comt\u00e9 is also at the top of my list . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of roquefort though , unless we 're talking about a roquefort sauce that you 'd eat with a nice steak . 
  hmm . 
  i also love goat cheese . 
  sometimes with some apricot jam . 
  i 'd serve that when i worked as a waiter in a restaurant in dr\u00f4me proven\u00e7ale . 
  people would order local goat cheese and i 'd get them a small glass with some homemade jam made with local apricots to go with the cheese . 
  i loved to watch their surprised expressions turn into pure satisfaction as they tried the combo . 
  probably . 
  i just picked random places that came to my mind , mostly places i 've visited before  i have yet to visit the gorges du verdon , though . 
  which is obviously a shame and something i need to take care of someday . 
  yes , it is one of the well-known ch\u00e2teaux de la loire not far from tours . 
  that one is my favourite , 
  i could do this all day . 
  [ beer or wine ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/dzyxzgmcbc264/giphy.gif ) ? 
  i could n't find a way to represent a french-brazilian person living in germany with one single flag , 
  in my experience , it is definitely a problem in my time off and a mild annoyance at work . 
  enough for me to be looking for a job elsewhere just because my german is not good enough and my life quality is kinda shitty because of it . 
  all friends i have made while living in germany are also foreign ... 
  on [ this ] ( http://img.fotocommunity.com/der-mannheimer-fernmeldeturm-bei-nacht-e381f409-1818-4d6b-a09b-8867568ccccd.jpg?width=1000 ) picture you can see yet another trashy tv tower , which is the highest building in mannheim , germany ( 212m high ) . 
  then there 's a bunch of industrial chimneys below that mark , and then the apartment building that is also on the picture . 
  well , i do n't know any good brands i could recommend , but you 'll find a lot of different brands of `` cr\u00e8me de cassis '' ( this type of liquor ) in supermarkets . 
  i 'd try a kir in a bar first though . 
  then if you like it , go ahead and get a bottle , which should last a while since you do n't use a lot of it in a cocktail , otherwise it gets too sweet . 
  stay strong and do n't go crazy despite the current worldwide shitstorm . 
  i 'm sure italians , germans , brits and spaniards will agree , 
  i live in western germany , but i think germans are in a better spot to tell you about weinschorle , hugo and various j\u00e4germeister cocktails than i am . 
  besides , there have been some german responses already . 
  so instead , i 'm picking northwestern france , where i used to live . 
  in rennes ( brittany ) , for example , i used to see a lot of people like whisky-coca-cola or whisky-red bull mixes . 
  a quick way to get pumped for a good night . 
  a freaky cocktail that is particular to the city of caen ( normandy ) is the * embuscade * ( `` ambush '' ) : blackcurrant syrup + dry white wine + calvados + beer . 
  i guess it 's named that way because you usually find it strangely easy to drink , then 5 minutes later you 're completely drunk . 
  a very french cocktail is the `` kir '' . 
  a simple kir is a mix of white wine ( traditionally aligot\u00e9 ) and blackcurrant liquor , and a * kir royal * replaces the white wine with champagne or some other sparkling wine . 
  in brittany , a * kir breton * is made with apple cider instead of wine . 
  another cocktail that 's characteristic of france is ti punch , coming from the caribbean islands . 
  not too different from a brazilian caipirinha . 
  apart from that , some classics are also popular : the aforementioned caipirinha , as well as mojitos , pi\u00f1as coladas , tequila sunrises , margaritas , g&t s. . . 
  let me put it this way : if europe was somehow allowed to vote , i think clinton would win by a landslide . 
  i do n't think trump would reach 15 % . 
  it 's like asking most non-french people what they think of marine le pen and most non-british people what they think of nigel farage . 
  why would people be in favor of a national populism movement in another country ? 
  the special thing about the usa is that the vote affects pretty much the whole world , while obviously only americans have access to it . 
  so from outside , we can only look at what 's happening and cross our fingers , i guess ? 
  ... * or * we can just whine when people say `` europe '' while referring to the eu , similarly to grammar nazis when somebody says `` their '' instead of `` they 're '' . 
  it 's fun to whine . 
  my partner is a french guy named s\u00e9bastien and whenever he 's driving i 'm scared shitless . 
  then again his aggressive driving could be useful in a rally i guess , but i wish he could calm the fuck down every now and then because we 're not in a freaking competition :|, 
  okay , i 've had a non-european driver 's license for more than 10 years but just recently got a french one as well . 
  i had to take the theoretical exam , so despite having driven for a while i had to refresh my memories on a few aspects . 
  in my driving school in france , this is how i was taught : imagine a roundabout with three exits ( the road you 're coming from + one exit to the right , one straight ahead , and one to the left ) . 
  * if you 're going right , you signal that you 're going right before entering the roundabout . 
  stay in the right lane , of course . 
  * if you 're going ahead , do n't signal anything before the roundabout , stay on the right lane . 
  as you pass the first exit ( to the right ) , signal right and exit at the second one . 
  * if you 're going left , signal left before entering the roundabout . 
  take the left lane . 
  as you pass the second exit ( straight ahead ) , signal right , move to the right lane , and then exit . 
  * if you 're planning on returning to where you are coming from , do it as you would if you were turning left ( signal left , take left lane , switch in roundabout at the last exit before yours ) . 
  probably belgium , and portugal would be a distant second on my list . 
  ( i live in germany by the way ) . 
  i 've met a few americans while travelling , not only in europe but also in south korea , where a lot of american , canadian , irish , english and australian people teach english . 
  i 've never felt closer to americans because for a change we were in the same `` group '' of people : western foreigners . 
  and since they worked there , they knew a lot of cool places and info about the city . 
  it was fun . 
  but we did n't keep in touch afterwards . 
  i also had a couple of american flatmates once . 
  they were from lousiana and staying in france for a while - the lad taught english , and the girl was just hoping to learn french . 
  i think it was the best flat-sharing experience i 've had so far . 
  when they went back to the us they split up and went separate ways , but i 'm still in contact with both of them via facebook . 
   nausea-stinky people who just come in to buy a 6-pack with the money they got from begging . 
  that reminds me of a beggar in rennes saying : `` do you have a few euros you could spare ? 
  do n't worry !, 
  it 's for beer '' . 
  points for honesty !, 
  of course americans have their own culture , that 's just ... no . 
  some people will also condescendingly state that american cuisine does n't exist , and that is also false . 
  there 's obviously more to the us than hamburgers . 
  people just wo n't find a jambalaya or a banana nut bread in a mcdonald 's menu . 
  and let 's not even get started on the richness of the american music . 
  i mean , really ? 
  the country of jazz , blues , country music has no culture ? 
  how absurd is that ? 
  just ignore the jerks saying there 's no american culture . 
  that is actually a pretty damn good summary . 
  well done . 
  monaco  _ , 
  oh , i see  i 'll try to pay attention to that to see if i notice the same thing . 
  speaking english with an american accent, 
  yes . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i 'm latin american ( born in brazil ) and i have also a french passport after living in france for a while and meeting a french significant other . 
  i have experienced a mixed bag of reactions to my origin , but mostly positive . 
  people seem to like brazil for some reason , too . 
  especially in france where people are often so curious about cultures and willing to discover different peoples and places . 
  sometimes people are not very knowledgeable about latin and south america . 
  in france , many people seem think those two expressions are mutually interchangeable , as in everything south of the us is south america .
