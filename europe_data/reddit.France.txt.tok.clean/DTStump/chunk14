  also i 've had many people thinking my mother language was spanish . 
  or assuming brazilian food is particularly spicy because everybody knows mexican food can be , so logically ... 
  anyway , when that happens , i actually enjoy having the opportunity to teach them something about the other side of the pond . 
  the negative experiences are probably not worth talking about , but they have n't happened very often , 
  i live in germany close to the rhine . 
  because of artificial ponds excavated in close proximity , there 's a number of different insects flying around . 
  i get a lot of different kinds of flies ( a lot of fruit flies but also some bigger ones ) and some mosquitoes too . 
  also pollinators - bees and bumblebees . 
  my cat loves destroying most of those . 
  not the mosquitoes though , i have to take care of those myself : /, 
  for some reason a bunch of people singing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) at a karaoke while drinking really expensive alcohol . 
  when you go to lisbon , take a small detour and rent a scooter in cascais at [ this place ] ( http://www.smoother.info/ ) . 
  the guy who owns the place is amazingly helpful and will give you a lot of info on the area . 
  among others , you can visit quinta da regaleira and the pena palace which is probably one of the most beautiful castles i have ever seen . 
  there 's this huge restaurant chain called [ buffalo grill ] ( http://www.buffalo-grill.fr/ ) in france . 
  you can find those everywhere in the country as well as some in other countries ( spain , switzerland ... ) , but it 's a french company . 
  it has this american theme with the usual stuff - burgers , bbq sauces , fries , some tex-mex stuff , etc , but it 's of course adapted to french tastes ( local cheeses , bread , etc ) . 
  not long ago i had a conversation on how every internationally-known , right-wing , nationalist , populist politician - donald trump , marine le pen , geert wilders , frauke petry , nigel farage , you name it - seems to have a significant following in their respective countries but a terrible reputation elsewhere . 
  i think this applies to wilders . 
  you 're not going to find a lot of his fans outside the netherlands . 
  yes and no  you 're right that there is a difference , but there is still a vowel in the french pronunciation . 
  in german it is an `` e '' ( international phonetic alphabet ) , whereas in french it is an '' \u0259 '' ( which sounds a little bit like the `` a `` s in `` america '' ) . 
  but in everyday life the difference is not very perceptible and a french person could still giggle depending on his or her maturity , 
  or japanese ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i have an internal joke with some friends abour our utter inability to learn german correctly and we deliberately say `` tsch\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcusss ! '', 
  as we toast . 
  we have had some weird looks from strangers in bars :d, 
  even better with the german * bitte * , which means `` please '' and `` you 're welcome '' depending on the context . 
  so polite germans say it all the time . 
  and it sounds * exactly * like french `` dick '' . 
  ah , another detail involving portuguese and other romance languages : people usually say something like `` tchin tchin '' or `` tchin '' as they toast . 
  in french it 's usually just `` tchin '' , in portuguese you usually say it twice . 
  i 've heard saying something close to `` tchin tchin '' in japanese means dick . 
  so you got ta be careful with that . 
  ok , here 's a story i like . 
  i 've heard of a czech music professor who moved to brazil and had a fair share of difficulties with portuguese . 
  often , he 'd read things , only know some of the words in portuguese , and fill the gaps with things those words looked like . 
  a very common road sign in brazil states : '' * curva perigosa * '' : dangerous curve ahead . 
  well , this guy knew that perigosa meant dangerous . 
  and curva ... well , i think kurva means whore in czech ( somebody correct me if i 'm wrong ! ) . 
  so he interpreted those signs everywhere as `` dangerous bitch '' . 
  and he kept wondering what was wrong with the locals . 
  there are two regions that often produce decent beers to my knowledge : brittany and nord-pas-de-calais ( * lol hauts-de-france lololol * ) . 
  there 's [ an trappist beer that is produced in france , too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trappist_beer#other_trappist_beers ) . 
  i 'm also a fan of the fischer brewery in alsace . 
  and i 've even tried some craft beers produced in dr\u00f4me that were pretty damn good . 
  in any case , all the best french beers are definitely not mainstream . 
  as is often the case , the most popular beers are pretty bad : kronenbourg and 1664 . 
  you can add france , spain , portugal , italy , and a lot of non-european countries ( e.g. 
  latin america ) to the list of `` odd ones '' i guess . 
  i 'm currently renting an apartment in an area where the average cost of renting is about 10 $ / m \u00b2 . 
  the apartment is 90m \u00b2 big . 
  ( edit : i should probably add that this is in germany despite my flair ) . 
  by the way , i find [ this website ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ ) quite useful to compare the cost of living of two areas ( including details on rent , food , clothes , transportation , etc ) . 
  and i was saying that at least he does n't have the name of a hungarian region while he has no link whatsoever with hungary , because he actually does , 
  how is fran\u00e7ois a language , though, 
  well , his father came from hungary ( according to wikipedia his name was nagyb\u00f3csai s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy p\u00e1l istvan ern\u0151 ) . 
  and nicolas has the nerve of being a proud member of the anti-immigration club . 
  smh ... 
  come to mannheim , it 's not nearly as ugly as the other side of the river !, 
  next thing you know , the english are patriotic because they often do n't speak anything other than english . 
  * facelpalm *, 
  my partner used to be the general manager in a hotel/restaurant in a place where they had these bicycle racing competitions . 
  every now and then a huge team of bikers would book all the rooms in the hotel . 
  and then they requested ... pasta for breakfast . 
  but i guess this is related to a specific need for high-level sports . 
  i guess it 's a great source of carbs and they needed that . 
  but yes , there are rules that are expected to be respected , particularly in countries where there 's this food-and-drink-loving cult like france and italy . 
  there are things you do n't mix , and things you do n't eat or drink depending on the time of the day . 
  i generally act in accordance with all those rules but when i 'm by myself they can go out of the window . 
  a bowl of cereals for dinner when nobody 's watching ? 
  sign me up . 
  edit : another interesting story about my partner 's experience in hotels : german customers in france have complained several times about the complete absence of sparkling wine in the breakfast buffet . 
  it always struck us as a weird thing to ask for . 
  and then we noticed that a lot of german hotels have it ... , 
  or more commonly , `` non mais cr\u00e8ve , putain ! '' . 
  french is so romantic . 
  in some parts of germany ( e.g. 
  rheinland-pfalz , close to the french border ) it 's also pretty common to say `` merci '' . 
  i was quite surprised when somebody said it to me the first time as i was holding the door that person . 
  i thought `` what the hell , i did n't even say a word !, 
  how does he know i speak french ?! '', 
  it 's funny how it 's actually frowned upon to try and pronounce english words correctly when you 're in france . 
  for example ... if you 're saying an english word , you should n't try and pronounce the letter r the way native english speakers would do . 
  it sounds like you 're trying too hard or that you 're just showing off . 
  instead , if you refer to the popular `` tinder '' app , you should pronounce it * tindeur * with a french * eur * , or you 're just being a prick . 
  i 'm quite partial to * shampoo * . 
  in france , not only people call it * shampooing * , but the ing is actually pronounced the french way ( i.e. 
  a nasal * in * like one would pronounce * lin * gerie ) . 
  this is not the case for other loanwords ending in - ing , like parking or jogging . 
  i do n't know how that happened . 
   instead i learned , `` bonjour monsieur oiseau . 
  le mason c'est rouge '' , and other such nonsensical balderdash . 
  meanwhile , english classes in france are all about `` where is bryan ? 
  bryan is in the kitchen '' . 
  ask any frenchman where bryan is , he 'll just * know * the kitchen is the only correct answer . 
  comments on * dreaming about a bank * coming in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  a little bit ... then again , i guess that goes for the whole continent or a big part of it . 
  in the case of germany , i 'm mostly referring to the * besserwisser * - type of people . 
  some people really have to show they know better than you , and they seem bizarrely common around here , especially at work ... might be just my personal experience .
