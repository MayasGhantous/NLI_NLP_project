  uganda ranked second . 
  just make sure you 're not gay . 
  well , paprikas are not edible anyway . 
  that 's not a bad use :d, 
  how many reddit threads should i read so it counts as a book ? 
  they might be forced to wear something , so to prevent that , let 's punish them for wearing it and force them to wear something else . 
  sounds reasonable . 
   like a warmer iceland waterland ? 
  ... okay , i 'll show myself out . 
  i think that explains a lot . 
  the fact that a lot of people in europe speak german helps . 
  it 's a bit like the uk - why bother learning another language when it 's so easy to get around with your native language ? 
  to some extent i also think that is true for southern countries , where the [ population does n't go abroad often when on vacation ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/3/39/trips%2c_nights_spent_and_average_length_of_trips_made_by_eu_residents_by_destination%2c_2014.png/631px-trips%2c_nights_spent_and_average_length_of_trips_made_by_eu_residents_by_destination%2c_2014.png ) . 
  for example , people from countries like romania , portugal , spain , greece and france just do domestic trips more than 85 % of the time . 
  however , there 's an egg-and-chicken situation here : do people stay home because they do n't speak foreign languages , or do they not bother learning other languages because they do n't like to go abroad ? 
  and of course , this is just tourism and there are obvious reasons to learn a second language for other reasons ( e.g. 
  work !, 
  ) , so it 's a complex thing to explain the reasons for this disparity . 
  as a rule of thumb though , [ smaller european countries tend to be more bilingual ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/average-number-of-languages-spoken-by-the-eu-population/ ) . 
  crap , you quoted my bad phrasing before i could fix it  my own experience is also obviously not meant to be taken as a very informative piece of evidence , but of course these personal observations also apply to other populations considered as awful english speakers . 
  i 'm just saying ... assuming a lot of germans speak perfect english is a common clich\u00e9 , and in my opinion not very realistic . 
  well , i 'm also basing my statement on my own experience living as a foreigner in western germany for the last two years . 
  i was very surprised at the number of young people not speaking decent english at all . 
  the average knowledge of english in germany is crazy overrated . 
  it 's certainly above france , italy and other mediterranean countries , but it 's definitely not great . 
  edit : some [ info ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/map-of-the-percentage-of-people-speaking-english-in-the-eu-by-country/ ) posted here not long ago . 
  i do n't know , i 'm just saying my guess about what people may think . 
  not stating my own opinion . 
  i guess it 's because it 's mostly men doing all the killing . 
  turkey has been one of the countries the most often targeted by terrorist attacks , though . 
  at least make your low blows accurate . 
  forgive me if i 'm wrong , but it seems the amount of people [ not wanting turkey in the eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/chart/getchart/charttype/linechart//themeky/14/groupky/71/savfile/664 ) has increased from 45 % to 60 % between 1997 and 2010 according to eurobarometer , and i 'm guessing this trend has only grown from 2010 to now . 
  the public opinion is by no means static , it can change , and it is definitely influenced by new political developments . 
  i think there are too many differences between eu 's values and turkey 's ( today ) to make this work . 
  this can change in the future . 
  but the current trend is the opposite . 
  by the way , according to the [ redditquette ] ( https://np.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) : * ( do not ) complain about the votes you do or do not receive , especially by making a submission voicing your complaint . 
  you may have just gotten unlucky . 
  try submitting later or seek out other communities to submit to . 
  millions of people use reddit ; every story and comment gets at least a few up/downvotes . 
  some up/downvotes are by reddit to fuzz the votes in order to confuse spammers and cheaters . 
  * i completely understand your frustration , but it 's just the way it works . 
  shrug it off , karma is worthless , and keep posting . 
  newsflash : migrating to a foreign country is tough even under great conditions . 
  you do n't just leave your country unless you have a very good reason to do that . 
  it 's easy for us redditors to sit here behind our screens and point our fingers at people who are doing the best thing for themselves . 
  we can afford to be incredibly individualistic , but god forbid people run for their lives instead of fighting for the country they were unfortunate enough to be born in . 
  and if they are forced to die for their crappy country ruled by a tyrant , whatever . 
  we can just keep browsing for more funny cat gifs in the comfort of our homes . 
  edit : grammar, 
  on the other hand , the addition of norway would make it look like a limp dick with a tumor and a truly disturbing skin condition . 
   no where in the article is that indicated . 
   a waterpark in france is to be ** booked out ** for one day literally the first sentence . 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  there is a difference between electing capable people to make decisions that require some technical knowledge , and reducing a critical and complicated matter to a yes or no question and submitting it to the population to vote . 
  as someone who was born in rio , i have a very well-informed opinion . 
  but it is still just an opinion . 
  thus , the word `` arguably '' . 
  also the olympic games are only in rio ( arguably the most messed up city in the country ) , while the wc was spread throughout brazil . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was just a [ suggestion or a joke ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/sport/olympics/rio-2016/olympics-australia/rio-olympics-2016-mayor-offers-kangaroo-in-athletes-village-for-australians-20160724-gqct15.html ) . 
  of course , the australian delegation responded that a plumber would be more useful than a kangaroo . 
  just like the suggestion of including a kangaroo in the olympic village so the australians feel at home , the organizing committee included a tragicomedy for the greeks . 
  how thoughtful . 
  absolutely . 
  i do n't think places like cyprus , iceland or monaco are exactly `` off the beaten path '' ... 
  gerrit clearly understood the double entendre , though . 
  we 'll stick with the rest of the eu then :d, 
  there is nothing i like more than the relaxing atmosphere at the beach . 
  [ til ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/fleur_de_lys#apparition_de_la_fleur_de_lys_sous_louis_vii ) that fleur-de-lys refers to louis vii ( `` flor de loys '' ) and not to the lily , which is called lys in french . 
  interesting o_o, 
  agreed with everything except one thing - restricting the freedom of expressing pro-nazi stuff does not affect more than a tiny percentage of the population ( at least i hope so ) . 
  here are my points about this topic : 1 ) freedom of speech is idealized by many , and it is not absolute anywhere , not even in the usa . 
  is there freedom of speech in america ? 
  short answer : yes . 
  long answer : mostly , yes . 
  but there are limits : < insert 200 page dissertation here  . 
  is there freedom of speech in germany and in the eu ? 
  short answer : yes . 
  long answer , you know the drill . 
  2 ) limiting the freedom of speech is ultimately based on what is considered unacceptable by society . 
  like other rules ( cited the death penalty as an example ) . 
  3 ) i do n't think it is absurd to forbid nazi parties , demonstrations and symbols in a continent that was ravaged by those ideas . 
  4 ) lastly , and to recapture the first comment in the thread , this particular limit to the freedom of expression should n't be named `` good nazism '' . 
  because we 're talking about putting a few criminals in jail or making them pay fines or whatever . 
  this should not be compared to a doctrine that promoted genocide . 
  by the way , i am not downvoting anybody . 
  i think it 's a fruitful discussion . 
  secondly , i 'm not german though i live in germany - i 'm a french-brazilian citizen . 
  i 'm not sure about the status of every controversial document in any of those three countries though - i do know that mein kampf is forbidden both in france and in germany , though people will ilegally download it if they want to . 
  i think that you do have to draw a line somewhere , and this has a an obviously subjective factor involved . 
  take the death penalty for example - it is possible in some states of america , but not in the eu ( afaik , in the whole union , somebody correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  in france , most people are terrified of the very idea of a death penalty , it is considered barbaric . 
  it 's a cultural thing . 
  in europe , i 'm fine with not allowing the support of nazi ideals . 
  ok , people can express themselves freely about the lack of control on immigration without any kind of consequence . 
  how about a kkk manifesto ? 
  is that also ok ? 
  how about distributing copies of mein kampf ? 
  or child erotica ? 
  where do you draw the line , or should the freedom of speech be absolutely limitless ?
