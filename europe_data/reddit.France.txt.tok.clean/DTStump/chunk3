   we see rights to the free speech being gradually taken away ? 
    well , we already know that , right ? 
  the points were : 1 ) it 's may not be as recent as you suggest , and 2 ) if living in a true democracy means people wo n't be punished for expressing some of those `` exceptions '' - say , child pornography for example - then i guess i 'm not so radically in favor of that democracy after all . 
   there are even countries where they would just chop your head off . 
  it still is not common in germany wow . 
  no , it is not . 
  see , there is a difference . 
  and it is not just `` in flavour '' . 
   you could . 
  until recently . 
  until liberal totalitarian thought took over and begun to gag the people . 
  [ have a look here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions )  but in that case it has existed always in all societies in the world . 
    even in isis controlled area you can say that prophet is a pig . 
  of course there will be consequences . 
  but , hey !, 
  nothing to do with limiting free speech !, 
  go on !, 
  say it !, 
  i might have chosen the wrong words here , but i 'm pretty sure there is a difference between the way censoring happens in dictatorships and the fact that you can be punished for attacking people in democracies . 
  the difference is not small . 
  i 'm not mixing up powers - instead , i mentioned different phenomena as distinct examples that go against the assumption that you can just say whatever you want and nothing will happen . 
  throwing people in jail for hate speech is also rare in europe , by the way . 
  hell , in my german town i keep seeing swastikas everywhere , i 've had neonazi demonstrations in front of my building twice and i do n't think anything ever happens . 
  also i suspect you have had [ regulations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions ) concerning freedom of speech exceptions for more than 20 years . 
   you can ( or until recently could ) say all you please . 
  and it not only did not hurt anyone , but helped to grow a responsible civil society . 
  that is not really true . 
  many people have been fired in the us for homophobic or racist remarks , faced prosecution , or even been [ thrown in jail ] ( http://www.wnd.com/2002/02/12844/ ) . 
  freedom of speech does n't mean that you can say anything and face no consequences . 
  it just means that you can say anything . 
  that 's not `` good nazism '' though , it is just regulation against hate speech . 
  which is obviously necessary , seeing that societies will quickly turn into a ball of hatred if such things go unchecked . 
  it 's like plane crashes or shark attacks , to some extent . 
  the likelihood is not really proportional to the horror . 
  but as much as people are aware of that , you ca n't just make the fear go away . 
  i do n't think that a person who 's scared of flying would feel better in a plane if we told him/her that it 's far more probable to die in a car accident . 
  yes you can . 
  still gon na get downvoted , but do n't let that stop you . 
  one has a difficult relationship with france and the other has a difficult relationship with france, 
  exactly . 
  i have lost count of french people whining and shouting `` just send them to their home country ! '', 
  while referring to other frenchmen . 
  these are the moments where you see most people give in to the violence and some who prefer to hold on to their principles . 
  yeah , super funny to give people the benefit of doubt . 
  interestingly , in france people also informally call germans '' * teutons * '' , which etymologically comes from the same root as deutsch , duits ( in dutch ) , dutch ( in english , not the same people though lol ) , tyska ( in swedish ) , tedesco ( in italian ) ... 
  best friends ?!, 
  is this the real life ? 
  [ two of the most atheistic countries in the world ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/atheists-countries-list-six-world-most-convinced-a6946291.html ) : catholic . 
  is that the country where you have countless statues of the probable most powerful person in history to engage in regular gay sex ? 
  i like it . 
  i have to say , as a french-brazilian person living in germany ... this has been ... orgasmic . 
  also making mannheim actually look like a beautiful place considering the other side of the rhine is pretty much the ugliest city i have ever seen . 
  [ you sure ? ], 
  ( http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-wont-rule-out-using-nukes-in-europe/ ) not that i am saying either `` promise '' is realistic ( building a wall or considering the nuke option ) , but both are in his speeches . 
  that is irrelevant with regards to the point i am trying to make . 
  individual thinking exists . 
  homophobia does not come with your birth certificate . 
  saying a whole country ( 100 % ) `` feels '' this or that way about a lgbt flag is offensive . 
  that 's the definition of a generalization . 
  this reminds me of ahmadinejad basically saying there are zero homossexuals in iran . 
  zero . 
  sure thing . 
  `` i wonder how this country inhabited by 80 million people feels about this subject '' lgbt-friendliness and being turkish are not incompatible , you know . 
  til a whole country has only one opinion on everything , and people from a country do n't think any different, 
  you mean putin secretly puts both thumbs down his pants . 
  eh , i like it . 
  i 'm expecting brussels to take care of that . 
  in football . 
  agreed . 
  calling the eu a real union is hyperbolic and everybody knows that there are serious divisions even within countries ( e.g. 
  having everybody live together as a single society is the greatest challenge and dream in this continent , and that was one of the missions of the eu which seem pretty damn close to impossible . 
  personally i feel very upset about what happened today because we 're not getting any closer to that admittedly unrealistic objective . 
  and make no mistake : the very day any other country decides to be the second to leave the eu , they also might be surprised to discover they were not that appreciated to begin with . 
  it 's the way it is . 
  tl ; dr : in europe everybody hates each other and that 's why australia does so well in eurovision, 
  that is not a bad thing ( as a matter of fact , many people in the eu are for the same process for their own countries ) . 
  just not a very `` teamwork-inspired '' kind of decision . 
  by voting `` leave '' , the uk put themselves in the position of an outsider , while potentially harming itself , the eu , and even the rest of the world . 
  nobody fully understands the consequences . 
  the uk played with fire and the rest of the eu could only watch . 
  in my view , it is not surprising that eu citizens start to view the uk just like the us or china - the `` competition '' . 
  besides , watching the brexit succeed would threaten the unity of the other 27 ... 
  that is true for both sides as well as for the entire human species . 
  associations and unions work when everybody is satisfied with their own benefits . 
  from an european perspective , the major messages that are coming from this event are that the uk wanted more money for themselves ( too much money injected into the eu , not enough coming back ) , less rules coming from `` above '' ( or brussels ) , more control over the borders . 
  how is that unselfish ? 
  it 's a little bit like a divorce , really . 
  some emotional reactions may follow but that does n't mean that the ex-couple can not be friends later . 
  ( are you really that surprised that people are angry about this ? 
  we 're all going to face a huge crisis because of this one-sided decision ), 
  it 's going to be a long process of `` divorce '' and i 'm sure arrangements will be made in the meantime for people to stay exactly where they are , if they want to . 
  i 'm expecting a geographical shift in job opportunities , though , and as a result people may actually not want to stay where they are . 
   let 's see , who helped them globally , which countries . 
  here are some country statistics regarding the number of refugees from the syrian war : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war, 
  goddamn foreigners parasitizing france . 
  ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ ^ guys, 
  they 're certainly not as widespread in france as they are in germany . 
  in germany you pay for the bottle ( * pfand * , `` deposit '' ) and then you get some money back when you return the empty bottle in one of those machines . 
  in france , this system does not exist . 
  enlighten me .
