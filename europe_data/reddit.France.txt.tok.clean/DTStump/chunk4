  how am i mistaken on this ? 
  edit : never mind , just noticed your username . 
  carry on trolling , trollie95 . 
  well , as a south american myself ( naturalized french ) , i certainly do understand it . 
  a lot of latin americans are very sensitive to other 's ignorance with regards to their countries , because it makes them feel like they do n't matter enough to be known ( and it happens a * lot * ) . 
  when it comes to geography and cultures , `` lumping things together '' usually shows ignorance and ignorance can be insulting in some cases . 
  it 's totally black and blue . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5835320/map-in-the-whole-world-only-these-five-countries-escaped-european ), 
  mexico is not in south america . 
  latin america yes , south america no . 
  but if everybody is a hipster ... then is anybody really a hipster ? 
  ^ ^ ^ bruh . 
  absolutely . 
  very treacherous territory . 
  on a more serious note , there are two really popular , cheap beers in france : kronenbourg , and 1664 . 
  you 'll find those everywhere . 
  at the risk of sounding like a hipster ... if it 's mainstream beer , it ca n't be that good :p, 
  he 's trolling you ( probably ) . 
  kronenbourg is french pisswasser . 
  ca n't go too wrong with a fischer or a jenlain , though , if you want to stick with big brands . 
  better beers are not that mainstream , similarly to most other countries . 
  i 'm not familiar enough with the context of the two elections to argue whether i think the increase of 4.7 % to 7.15 % was likely due to the difference in turnout or to other factors ( other candidates running , political trends , campaign effectiveness , etc ) . 
  to me , that 's still not enough to confirm a correlation . 
  but maybe you 're right . 
  in any case , i do think it 's healthy that citizens go vote . 
  judging by this comment and others you posted on this thread , you seem to blame the poor quality of elected representatives on poor voter turnout . 
  there 's not necessarily a correlation there . 
  there are countries where voting is mandatory ( turnout being close to 100 % ) , and that does n't mean those kinds of corrupt jackasses are not elected . 
  it is true that in france that voter turnout tends to be negatively correlated with the success of far right extremists ( or that 's what we 're told : if you do n't go vote , the fn is going to be on top !, 
  ) , but this is not the case everywhere . 
  the airport thing has been a huge deal for decades now . 
  i suspect this chart is representing the number of native speakers * in europe * , judging by how german is bigger than english and spanish ( two of the most spoken languages in the world ) . 
  therefore the portuguese bubble only includes portugal and portuguese-speaking minorities in other european countries ( e.g. 
  you could make a whole freaking dictionary with all that . 
   though if i remember correctly , other eu citizenships would be exempt or something . 
  and russia . 
  for reasons . 
  yes , when i started to learn german i expected to learn the vocabulary much faster because i assumed it would be lexically close to english . 
  i was very wrong . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_influence_in_english ) wikipedia article suggests up to 60 % of the modern english vocabulary is influenced by romance languages . 
  actually , it seems there are n't d : i made a mistake because i read the results from this poll on two different sources . 
  i 'm fixing the previous post now . 
  while i agree with you that in most polls he 's second , ~ ~ sometimes ~ ~ he 's first ~ ~ ( cf. ~ ~ on the poll we 're discussing in this exact thread ~ ~ ) ~ ~ , but never third lately . 
  edit : correction - there is one poll where he 's first , and zero where he 's third in the last few weeks . 
  well , i hope those fans are aware that they 're making their clubs a lot less attractive to a lot of really talented players . 
  idiots . 
  sure . 
  and as long as he 's at the top , and not third place in the polls , it is looking * likely * that he makes it . 
  so thinking he 'll be in the second round does n't mean people are `` desperate to believe it '' - it just means that people are predicting that he will . 
  firmly believing jadot will make it to the second round would be desperate . 
  macron ? 
  nah , that 's just logic . 
  who is this `` marcon '' guy you 're talking about ? 
   it seems everyone is desperate to believe that marcon will reach the second round . 
   it seems marcon may well make it . 
  whatever you say , buddy . 
   but looking at the polls , at least the conventional ones , it may also be fillon and le pen le pen is probably going to make it . 
  which does not mean macron does n't make it too . 
  brb renting a truck to pick up some cats in istanbul \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557, 
  it 's a bit early for lavender flowers in france . 
  i 'd expect a landscape like this around the month of june . 
  i think bulgaria overtook france for the # 1 spot in worldwide lavender production not too long ago . 
  bulgarian photos incoming ? 
  probably because pede ( or more precisely , p\u00e9d\u00e9 ) is an homophobic slur in french . 
  it would be basically like calling your friends `` faggots '' . 
  reading this thread as a gay person is an emotional rollercoaster with all the fantastic support and all the hurtful comments . 
  in any case , it is always a pleasant surprise to read positive comments from people who come from countries where we are still generally considered as inferior human beings . 
  it 's recomforting somehow . 
  that 's because there 's a kitten hidden in the cow 's mouth . 
  it 's asking for help . 
  it is said that something close to 2/3rds of the oxygen turnover come from marine plants and algae , and roughly 1/3rd from rainforests , with a very small percentage from other sources . 
  temperate forests are super important , but not so much for that reason , i think :p, 
  i 'm glad we have our priorities straight . 
  our ability to detect sarcasm can also vary immensely from square km to square km, 
  i think i can see an lgbt flag there somewhere . 
  got ta find some photo involving the sea , a snowy beach , and some red houses i guess ? 
  [ here 's one for 1/4 of the brazilian flag ] ( http://radioboanova.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bandeira_do_brasil.jpg ) . 
  that 's just kind of internet/sms language , though , not an actual diacritic . 
  and it would n't be read just like `` nh '' , or the spanish \u00f1 . 
  just like people will type `` qdo '' for `` quando '' , but that does n't mean that qdo is a real word . 
  sorry for nitpicking , but portuguese does n't have \u00f1 , that 's a spanish thing . 
  nh is the portuguese equivalent . 
  yes , and make them work too . 
  work sets you free , after all . 
  i am now imagining acts of terrorism somehow perpetrated with [ baroque music ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georg_philipp_telemann ) . 
  how about [ the army of god ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_of_god_ ( united_states \\ ) ) or [ lord 's resistance army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_resistance_army ) ? 
  seeing that changing one 's sexual orientation is basically impossible and it 's potentially very harmful to try to change it , and the second option requires only that people get more education and become more tolerant , i think the response is pretty clear . 
  there are plenty of gay people unhappy with the fact that they are gay , because society does n't exactly make their life easy . 
  i 'm not defending this barbaric `` treatment '' , but of course there are people unhappy with their sexual orientation . 
  which incidentally makes the argument that orientation is a choice pretty laughable . 
  eh , i once moved from an appartment to a countryside house with two cats . 
  one of them stayed inside all the time despite having the option of going out , spending all his time sleeping and eating his conveniently-lifeless food . 
  the other one spent all her time outside killing everything in sight , and came back home every now and then with ridiculously large prey and sometimes even wounded . 
  ymmv . 
  i 'm not sure eva joly 's results were strongly linked to her origin , it 's just that her party has been kind of a trainwreck for a while now . 
  i do n't expect people who vote left and would consider voting for the green party to care too much about her accent . 
  maybe the far right does , but then again , those are not the people who would vote for the greens anyway . 
  now if french people publish something like that , people are going to bitch that we 're being arrogant as usual . 
  ( disclaimer : i actually love italian food , but get over yourselves :d ),
