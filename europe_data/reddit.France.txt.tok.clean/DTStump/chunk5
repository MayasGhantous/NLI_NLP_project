  nope , just le drian . 
  and the whole point of my comment was to point out the bizarre spelling in the article ... 
  i remember a generalist doctor once casually prescribed some antibiotics for my sore throat , and then i asked her whether it could be a viral thing for which the antibiotics would be useless . 
  she looked at me a little puzzled and answered that she could run a 5-minute test . 
  we did it . 
  it was not a bacterial infection . 
  i never went to that doctor again :|, 
   as lefties will all back the candidate they do n't consider to be a fascist . 
  that 's precisely the problem with sarkozy . 
  he has tried so hard to absorb part of the far-right electorate that lefties do n't know the difference between his ideas and the ones from the front national . 
  as a left-wing voter myself , i would n't bother to pick between sarkozy and mlp . 
  i do n't know which one i dislike the most . 
  the best thing about this is that i think this ultimately lowers the risk of having marine le pen as the next president . 
  if we ever got sarkozy and mlp in the second round of the elections , there would be a very significant chance anti-mlp voters just would n't bother to show up . 
  a person representing the r\u00e9publicains that is less abrasive than sarkozy might motivate people to actually vote against mlp in the second round .

  then again , france has a fair share of sausages to offer . 
  tl ; dr :  * `` vote for meeeeeee !, 
  in my case i witnessed a neo-nazi demonstration in front of my building ( i live in germany ) the morning after . 
  i do n't think i 'll forget that any time soon . 
  i 'm temporarily living in germany , and yes , even though i never watch german tv or listen to german radio , i still pay for it . 
  not too unhappy about it - i realize i pay for a lot of social stuff that i do n't benefit from . 
  this is just another one ( though it * is * annoying that they harass people who choose not to pay , instead of just taking that money from everyone 's wage , no questions asked ) . 
  weirdly , in brazil people call [ `` pistolets '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pistolet_ ( bread \\ ) ) french bread , and they 're the most common type of bread there . 
  i think a lot of people assume that for a very good reason : brazil is a very sexualized country . 
  brazilians start having sex relatively young on average , there are sex-oriented `` motels '' everywhere , carnaval is known for all those naked butts ( and getting drunk and fucking ) , sexual tourism is a huge thing , the country has an obsession with plastic surgery and looks in general , i could go on and on . 
  i know where the idea comes from . 
  sexual acceptance , however , is not correlated with that . 
  homo and transphobia in brazil may be relatively obvious when you check crime stats ( example [ here ] ( http://tgeu.org/265-killings-of-trans-people-in-last-12-months-reveals-tgeus-trans-murder-monitoring-project/ ) \\ ) , but that 's not the whole story : bullying and discrimination are just generalized . 
  it has been mostly fine to be a gay man living in france and in germany . 
  there are awkward moments here and there but nothing compared to the systemic homophobia i experienced living in brazil . 
  i think we 're running out of questions , guys . 
  `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' sounds awfully threatening in english . 
  * `` greet god , bastards ! '', 
  i try my best to ignore my own ego when somebody points out a mistake , even if it 's not particularly pleasant . 
  usually i 'm disappointed at myself for having made a mistake , but thankful for the correction which will allow me to improve in the future . 
  i can think of a single case where i was annoyed at the person correcting me : an american guy kept focussing on a particular accent flaw that i have , and after several comments on the same point i had to ask him to stop . 
  i just was n't able to change it , so it became pointless and annoying after a while . 
  water and wine . 
  when i had english classes , i learned to try and imitate mostly mainstream american accents . 
  i wish i had learned a more english accent though , it sounds fantastic . 
  native brazilian , naturalized french here . 
  my impressions : * brazilian portuguese : a melodic way of speaking , a `` blah '' language ( open vowel sounds ) . 
  people like saying `` futchib\u00f3u '' when they do their brazilian accent impression . 
  * european portuguese : a lot of * ch * sounds and a lot less `` blah '' than brazilian pt . 
  people like saying `` purrrtuguechhh '' . 
  a common reaction to portuguese : * `` i can totally understand what 's written there , but these sounds have nothing to do with it !, 
  '' * * french : nasal , monotonic , low-pitched , sexy . 
  that 's the stereotype , at least . 
  i like a lot of different cheeses , but the one i buy the most often and ca n't get enough of is comt\u00e9 . 
  i like how hungarian sounds . 
  i remember discreetly trying to repeat what i 'd hear on the streets of budapest because it sounded so cool . 
  especially the metro stations being announced : * ferenciek tere * . 
  i felt like there were a lot of t , k and r sounds , with a lot of `` e '' sounds between those consonants . 
  finnish also sounds really cool . 
  but solid butter :( why no grams . 
  why, 
  you 're right , but my point is that being really loud does n't warrant you stares :p it 's a normal thing . 
  being american and loud , though , that may indeed cause some curiosity . 
  well , i live in mannheim , so saying pfalz would be inaccurate . 
  on the other hand saying bw is not that descriptive either . 
  i guess i prefer saying kurpfalz or the rhein-neckar area . 
  one thing that really annoys me is `` a tablespoon of butter '' . 
  there 's no way to know exactly how much that is . 
  i use both types of measurements ( metric and cups/tablespoons/whatever ) , depending on where i got the recipe . 
  i ca n't be bothered to convert and i have the necessary material to cook with either type of measurement . 
  to be fair , germans can be quite loud as well . 
  at least the ones in the region where i live ( kurpfalz ) and the ones who take the frankfurt - paris train . 
  i do n't know if it 's different elsewhere . 
  or how the basque country retained its non-indo-european language despite being surrounded by romance languages . 
  you can just say `` i got a cold and i would n't want you to be sick :d so stay the hell away from me thx '' . 
  it 's totally acceptable . 
   also , english might have a lot of romance words , but most of them are hardly ever used . 
  mostly you 'd use germanic words . 
  a fun thing to do is actually counting which words belong to which language group you 're probably right , but the point for me is that i have latin * options * in english when i 'm building sentences . 
  for example , english has `` hard '' ( germanic ) and `` difficult '' ( latin ) ; most of the time people say `` hard '' , but if i know the word `` difficult '' because of another language , i can just use it and people will understand it though it might sound unusual . 
  same with `` come in '' ( g ) or `` enter '' ( l ) : it would be weird to tell someone `` hey , enter ! '', 
  instead of `` hey , come in !, 
  '' , but it works anyway . 
  but i think the biggest factor is still exposure . 
  there are so many films and songs in english * everywhere * , you can not help but absorb part of the vocabulary almost passively . 
  german , while a big language ( the most spoken in europe , i think ) , does n't get the same kind of exposure . 
  vocabulary . 
  i speak portuguese , french and english fluently , as well as a little bit of spanish ( which i only studied for one year but i feel like i could really learn it fast if i gave it a try ) . 
  out of those , only english is not a romance language . 
  however , [ around 60 % of the modern english vocabulary comes from latin / french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_influence_in_english ) ; besides , everybody gets a lot of exposure to english words every day . 
  in summary , knowing words in those languages in my case can be a lot of ctrl + c , ctrl + v and adding the proper suffixes . 
  so now that i 'm learning german ( and failing miserably ) ... 
  i really feel that for the very first time while learning a language , i 'm having significant trouble with vocabulary . 
  when speaking a romance language , even one i do n't know too well ( currently , spanish ) i can just begin any sentence and feel confident that i 'll be able to finish it because i will find a word for everything , even if it 's not 100 % accurate . 
  with german , my feeling is that before even bothering to say the beginning of a sentence , i need to make sure ( in my brain ) that i know the appropriate words to finish it . 
  as a result , 80 % of my sentences are `` rejected '' before they ever get out of my mouth . 
  grammar is complicated , and of course all the modes and declinations , but you * can * express yourself making a bunch of mistakes ( putting the verb in the wrong place , mistaking die for das , using dativ where you 're supposed to use akkusativ , among others ) . 
  you * ca n't * , however , have a conversation if the vocabulary is lacking . 
  a study was made in france sampling in paris and elsewhere . 
  the findings were : * about half of the masculine population ( 48 % ) has some facial hair ; * a `` 3-day '' beard is the favorite type according to women ( 33 % ) , while 4 % prefered a `` 10-day '' beard , 4 % preferred a stubble and 0 % preferred a long beard ; * only 4 % of men have only mustaches ( contrarily to the french stereotype , i guess ) ; * young people like beards : 81 % of women below 25 years old prefer bearded men , 55 % of men aged from 25 to 34 have a beard ; * 59 % of left-winged men have beards . 
  it 's more of a leftist thing ; * in fact , one could establish a correlation of sorts between politics and beards , at least in paris .

  the main map is for beard prevalence ( pink -  more beards ) and the little map on the corner is about politics ( pink -  more left-leaning mindsets ) ; * beards are more popular in the [ north ] ( http://img2.grazia.fr/var/grazia/storage/images/media/images/societe/carte-france-barbe/13515891-1-fre-fr/carte-france-barbe.jpg ) .
