  you have just subscribed to / r/frenchbeardfacts . 
  i 've been an expat twice in my life . 
  i left my home country back in 2008 . 
  * experience # 1 : moving from brazil to france for a md. 
  i ended up falling in love with france * and * with a french person , stuck around for a phd , and later applied and obtained the dual citizenship . 
  i 'm a total france fanboy . 
  verdict : no regrets . 
  * experience # 2 : moving from france to germany for work . 
  sometime after my phd , i applied for a position in lyon , to work for a german multinational . 
  after 4 interviews my application was rejected , but they offered me a position based in germany , and i could n't afford to refuse it at the time . 
  nevertheless , i never could quite adapt to germany , even though the job is great . 
  so after 2 years and a half , i 'm trying hard to go back to france . 
  verdict : no real regret , the decision was correct , but i still need to move back . 
  so nothing . 
  that was my comment . 
  just felt like stating that . 
  questions here do n't have to be europe-related . 
  they can be about pretty much anything , with the objective of getting responses from an european perspective . 
  according to your definition of free speech , there are exactly zero countries in the world that allow free speech . 
  huh , i have n't heard about that , that 's interesting !, 
  this would give the right wing a moderate/more centrist candidate which they have n't had so far . 
  i think some of the people who might vote for macron under the current set-up may prefer to vote for bayrou solely for the fact that the former was still a minister under hollande . 
  i would expect that this new development could mean bayrou taking a chunk out of the macron voter population and getting a lot of former fillon voters , which could result in an even tighter race . 
   not an expert here you could have stopped there . 
  personally , i think the probabilities are in favour of the following scenario : * fillon sticks to his candidacy despite a * lot * of corruption rumors being revealed recently . 
  his popularity decreases , however , and he drops from the second position in the race . 
  the last polls before the rumors had him at around 22 % , behind mlp with 25 % and ahead of macron with 20-21 % . 
  * hamon and m\u00e9lenchon share the same niche , which is the small part of the voter base that is still willing to go left after a very impopular socialist party presidential term . 
  their combined scores are around 25-30 % , give or take , and both are eliminated * a part of the socialist party voter base picks macron . 
  this , combined with fillon 's fall , puts him in the second round with mlp . 
  * marine le pen confirms the trend of the last few years with a very loyal voter base that 's not going to migrate to other candidates unless a huge surprise happens . 
  * second round : mlp versus macron . 
  they get close scores in the first round , and a huge part of the voter base picks the centrist candidate against the much maligned far right . 
  macron wins with a comfortable margin . 
  honestly , considering all the meme wars and potentially-reasonable discussions that turn into flaming contests , i can understand looking for people with similar mindsets . 
  it 's a natural tendency . 
  sometimes , people just want to be heard without being attacked , and let 's be honest , there are not a lot of truly civilized arguments these days between right-winged and left-winged people on reddit or irl . 
  it 's a shame , but that 's the way it goes . 
  i 'm a bit of an odd case , being born in a south american country and becoming a french citizen in 2014 after having lived several years in france . 
  i do n't feel `` as french '' as regular french people but i 'm a total france fanboy and very proud of my choice . 
  but even though getting a french passport may make me french ( or at least a french citizen ) , i feel it does n't make me european . 
  i 'm very pro-eu though . 
  i think wasabi chips can be found in several countries , but they 're still super weird to me . 
   edit : umm , why am i getting downvoted ? 
  no idea , and i thought your post was pretty interesting and informative . 
  upvoted . 
  in brazil , where i was born and grew up , natives were mostly exterminated . 
  we learn in school that portuguese colonization was different than the spanish one , in that portugal was not confronted with a very numerous civilization , but instead a bunch of different , smaller nations . 
  this meant less resistance ( i.e. 
  war ) , but the result ended up the same due to a combination of slavery , diseases , and some military conflicts as well . 
  at some point , portuguese colonizers deemed the natives too fragile/not fit for slavery purposes and imported slaves from africa . 
  it was also easier to control slaves when they were not in familiar places : an african slave was much more disoriented away from his or her family and birthplace than a `` local '' . 
  in the brazilian society today , it is estimated that about 1 % of the population has native american roots , and amerindians are regularly victims of the [ worst kind of racist acts ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/14/world/4-in-brazil-cleared-of-murder-in-burning-of-indian.html ) . 
  the brazilian government does n't have a very good history of respecting the protected amerindian areas that were agreed upon , either . 
  yes , the german debit cards are called ec-karte . 
  i have one of those along with a french visa credit card . 
  it is often possible to pay with those ec-karte , not with credit cards . 
  but in that situation in saturn , i was n't able to pay with either . 
  i meant that it was often possible to pay in euros in restaurants and shops . 
  just a little more expensive than converting euros to huf , though . 
  i 'm interested in visiting and in learning more about every eu country , but if i have to pick one it would be malta , i guess . 
  i 'd also add the [ flower duet ( lakm\u00e9 , by l\u00e9o delibes ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h82i_fape0 ) to the list . 
  here in germany i once bought a 500 $ device in a saturn shop ( so pretty big ) and they would n't accept any card . 
  i had to withdraw 500 $ in cash to pay . 
  there 's a pretty good reason people living in germany usually carry at least 70 $ in their wallets all the time . 
  not true for budapest in my brief , personal experience . 
  sure . 
  i think a good rule of thumb for that kind of sensitive subject is that sticking to moderate views is often the best approach . 
  i 'm certainly not a fan of hysterical political correctness reactions , but i 'm not a fan of discarding all concerns in that area either . 
  i do n't think anybody has an issue with anybody saying what their ancestry is . 
  i think some get angry when americans say they * are * irish or italian because of their family 's origins . 
  `` irish-american '' ? 
  sure . 
  just `` irish '' when your only link to ireland is a great-grandfather ? 
  up for discussion . 
  i think there is a lot of disagreement ( here and elsewhere ) simply because we put a lot of things in the same `` cultural appropriation '' basket . 
  it 's just a bad label that encompasses a lot of things . 
  depending on your personal views , it 's likely that some of those things are ok and others are n't . 
  that 's my main issue with `` cultural appropriation '' - it 's just a bad label that 's far from being descriptive enough and it 's * very * open to different interpretations by different people . 
  i cringe at the thought of someone using this expression to accuse someone else . 
  i wish people would focus more on the concept of respecting other cultures instead of using that expression , which is often a misnomer ( some people may be thinking of cultural * mis * appropriation ) . 
  it 's just a confusing label . 
  it would just makes things easier to talk about respect : if a chinese person loves to eat italian food every day , is that disrespectful ? 
  of course not . 
  is a western person getting a traditional polynesian tatoo ( without knowing what it means ) disrespectful ? 
  in my book , it could be . 
  putting those things in the same category ( cultural appropriation ) seems ... simplistic . 
  that bag is completely right . 
  there is one typical from portugal ( `` ginja '' or `` ginjinha '' ) that you [ can have in a little chocolate cup ] ( https://kiwidutch.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ginjinha-ginja-1b-small.jpg ) . 
  you fill the chocolate cup with the sour cherry liquor and then eat the whole thing :d, 
   do n't copy american mispronunciation back into writing . 
  more like non-german mispronunciation . 
  not a lot of non-german speakers are aware of the `` equivalence '' between umlaut and adding an `` e '' to modify a vowel . 
  if the op does n't know german ( which is statistically likely ) , it is also likely that he/she is not * copying an american mistake * , but instead making a mistake that is very natural to basically anybody who does n't know german . 
  i was reading this thread and just thinking `` english ? 
  how about english ?! '', 
  and your comment just made me laugh . 
  have an upvote . 
  i had some today for the first time , it tasted a bit similar to [ colomba di pasqua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colomba_di_pasqua ) or [ panettone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panettone ) , with dried fruit and chunks of sugar .
