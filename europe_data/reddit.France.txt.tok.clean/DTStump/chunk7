  i do n't think the distinction between those terms is a consensus right now , but it 's gaining traction . 
   because you already know what the majority of replies will be do we ? 
  because right now the most upvoted comment on this thread is precisely arguing that nationalism is not a problem in itself . 
  i would n't have expected that . 
  besides , downvoted answers can still be an interesting read . 
   but can you pull the wool from over your eyes for a moment and admit that most europeans on reddit are left leaning , pro-eu ? 
  well , i conceded that in my first comment , but maybe did n't make it quite clear : when i said that * `` yes , there 's a high likelihood that one type of answer is more frequent than the others '' * , i basically admitted that yes , there is a high likelihood that not all political orientations are represented equally . 
  if we go from that principle , we may take one step further and hypothesize : ok , let us suppose that eu subreddits are mostly left-winged . 
  but that is not the core of my question , so i 'll try to rephrase it . 
  if we consider that european country subreddits , including / r/askeurope , are mostly left-winged , why would it be a `` bad place '' to ask a question concerning nationalism ? 
  where is the harm in asking left-wingers their opinion on nationalism ? 
  and are any other subreddits a better place ? 
  if so , which ones ? 
  right-wing-dominated subreddits ? 
  or centrist-dominated subreddits , if such a thing exists ? 
  i 'm not sure merkel 's decision was 100 % about saving the world , either . 
  some analysts argue that the refugee influx may be beneficial to countries with aging populations in the long term . 
  i wo n't argue about it because i 'm not well-informed enough , but my point is that there may be more to this policy than just `` saving the whole world '' . 
   this sub is a bad place to ask since the majority here are left wing anti-nationalists & pro-eu federalists . 
  i do n't get this . 
  this subreddit has a diverse population . 
  one type of mentality/political orientation is certainly more frequent than others , but then again that 's the case for almost every discussion platform on the web . 
  would the response to the op be biased ? 
  yes and no : yes , there 's a high likelihood that one type of answer is more frequent than the others , and no , you still get lots of individual , different answers . 
  ... but why would it be a `` bad place '' to ask such a question ? 
  because people may have a negative opinion about nationalism instead of a positive one , or because they may be left-wingers ? 
  should the question be asked on a more right-wing place instead ? 
  would that be a `` better '' place ? 
  taking mercosur/mercosul as the union i know best apart from the eu and the eurozone :  those unions dont have : single market , [ mercosur has it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:economic_integration_stages_ ( world \\ ) . png )  no borders between them  i meant schengen area style borders also that . 
   common parliament ... [ also that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercosur_parliament ) the one thing missing from the list is the single currency aspect and afaik there are no talks at the moment in that direction . 
  huh , i did n't know you could call that a daddy long legs too :p til . 
   daddy long legs . 
  which are not spiders  they are also arachnids , but opiliones instead of araneae . 
  one important difference is that they 're not almost all predators like spiders , but have a rather wide range of feeding behaviours ( they can eat small prey as well as plants , fungi , or decomposing matter ) . 
  also , they are unable to build webs , so if they are predators they have to hunt their prey actively or ambush them . 
  [ there is some data here ] ( http://chartsbin.com/view/xxj ), 
  heck , as a brazilian native who only studied spanish for 1 year sometimes i understood people better in spain than in portugal . 
  he has n't even started yet :d ... d :, 
  i am so triggered right now . 
   so basically they are pro life but also in favour of killing people . . 
  seems like a paradox some people have attacked abortion clinics , notably in the us , and killed a bunch of people . 
  oh , i had the impression that a few eu countries , russia , and the usa were somehow involved . 
  carry on then . 
  ( living in germany ) * s-bahn ( regional train ) to and from work : around 40 minutes a day * tramway : 1x or 2x 10 minutes a day * walking : minimum 40 minutes a day ( 20 minutes from train station to work ), 
  do n't tell that to isis . 
  cheap options : * low-cost flights ( only from certain airports to certain airports ... ) * carsharing ( mostly via blablacar ) * bus * special tickets for regional trains ( e.g. 
  `` ticketplus alsace '' if you 're travelling from rheinland-pfalz to alsace ) edit : from berlin to paris , have a look at [ these rough cost estimates ] ( https://www.rome2rio.com/s/berlin/paris ), 
  well , the only way a one-sided debate becomes two or multiple-sided is if people with unpopular opinions actually bother to share . 
  so at the very least , you have the comfort of knowing you did your part to make the discussion less monotonic , i guess ? 
  even if i were in agreement with your view on `` improving the gene pool '' ( which i 'm not , but that 's not the point ) , there are other ways of eliminating genes from the gene pool than death - anything that would make procreating impossible , for example . 
  for that reason , i do n't think eugenics are a solid argument to defend the death penalty . 
  i think that if you consider your opinion valid , you should n't be afraid of getting downvotes . 
  if you get downvoted , that 's unfortunate , and frustrating , but in the end it should n't really matter . 
  as long as you are at peace with the way you express yourself ... 
  i have a colleague at work who claims to come from bielefeld . 
  i do n't trust that guy . 
   does australia , nz , usa or canada have an indigenous president and are most of their inhabitants indigenous like bolivia ? 
  i would certainly argue that nz and australia have a much stronger indigenous presence than brazil , for example . 
  huh  til . 
   if a loaf or slice of bread should fall on the ground , you 're supposed to give it a kiss ; is that politeness or just some superstition ? 
  see , one big difference between us is that i begin my argument by saying that i disagree with you , then stating why , while you begin yours by claiming that i 'm wrong * and * incorrect ( whoa !, 
  redundance for aggressive emphasis right off the bat !, 
  ) , then point out a bunch of perceived logical fallacies and establishing your definition of a concept as unquestionable fact . 
  then you have the nerve to call me egocentric because i 'm not wrong to myself , while dismissing what i have to say as wrong and incorrect , as mentioned above . 
  you sound intelligent enough to have a reasonable argument , but you seem to choose not to and to be a jerk instead ( omg ad hominem ! ) . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  have fun talking to yourself if you decide to . 
  you 're speaking on behalf of those `` a lot of [ those ] people '' would it help if i stated that * i * consume things that i consider to be trash ? 
  i have been to mcdonald 's several times . 
  not proud of it . 
  i know i 'm not the only one . 
   `` it 's garbage because i say so/don ' t like it '' that 's a strawman fallacy . 
  never said that . 
   if `` trash '' is popular , then it is n't trash to begin with , just because you do n't like it . 
  and a re-use of the strawman , to justify * your own definition of trash * ( i.e. 
  `` if it 's popular , it is not trash '' ) . 
  i 'm using a dictionary definition : * literary or artistic material of poor or inferior quality . 
  quality , for a lot of things , is subject to non-objective assessment . 
  therefore , i will not be as presumptuous as you are and state that you are plain wrong for establishing a correlation between * `` trashiness '' * and popularity , but ... 
  i 'm not wrong either by stating that one could see something that 's popular as low quality anyway . 
  exactly . 
  as a south american-born person , i 'm always interested in people explaining to me what they consider the western world to be . 
  the response is usually `` europe , anglo-saxon america , australia , nz '' . 
  why ? 
  because `` those are the countries more directly influenced by european culture , religions , languages , etc '' . 
  then i ask , how about latin america ? 
  `` no , latin american countries are definitely not part of the west '' . 
  what , is latin america not heavily influenced by european values , history , traditions , culture , food , religions , etc etc etc ? 
  is latin america part of the eastern world , then ? 
  ( i guess poorer countries do n't fit the bill ), 
  i disagree that demand implies quality . 
  one could compare it to food , for example : a lot of people eat and love fast food , for several reasons , yet a lot of those same people would never argue against the fact that ... that food is pretty low quality . 
  by the same token , a lot of people watching ( and enjoying ) reality tv will honestly admit it 's pretty trashy . 
  trash * can * be popular . 
  in my view every country in the world is part of at least one continent . 
  i 'm pretty sure i would n't put ireland and the uk in america or africa or asia or whatever . 
  europe it is . 
  iceland as well , while we 're at it .
