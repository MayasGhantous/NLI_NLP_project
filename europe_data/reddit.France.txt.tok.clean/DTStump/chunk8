  dammit !, 
   apparently they serve gl\u00fchwein instead of coffee in their office today . 
  oh my god , i 'm so jealous :( at my work ( a big company in the rhein-neckar area ) we had a `` christmas lunch '' a few days ago . 
  when they started serving the appetizer i saw these champagne flutes filled with a sparkling rosey liquid and i got my hopes up ... then i tried one and there was no alcohol , i was so sad . 
  how else am i supposed to withstand our boss showing off his vacation photos for two hours while insisting that we have to spend less next year ? 
  i think kiabi is in about the same price range in france . 
  but as a side note , before buying stuff from there , i think it 's useful to [ reflect a little bit on how that stuff got so cheap in the first place ] ( http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1970431/true-cost-your-cheap-clothes-slave-wages-bangladesh-factory ) . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mxqmkvy.jpg?1 ) is the most appropriate one for france . 
  yes , turkey is one of the few countries that belong to two continents , with a clear geographical separation that most geographers agree upon . 
  the cultural separation is not that clear , and i do n't think it is very useful to put turkey * in * or * out * of an imaginary box in which european cultures would be hermetically sealed , with no gray zones . 
  and the seventh kid is dead :(, 
  right , it 's soccer , not socker , 
  i do n't know if someone says rugger , but a lot of people say soccer and it 's a correct word for the sport . 
  languages do the darndest things when populations split :p i speculate that at some point they created something official in america with the name `` soccer '' instead of `` association football '' and it kind of took off from there . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i ca n't stand the general attitude that people have when americans say soccer instead of football . 
  some even sarcastically say `` handegg '' when referring to american football , because football is supposed to be played with the feet , and the ball is supposed to have a spherical shape otherwise it 's not a real ball . 
  oh stop it with that soccer/football thing . 
  both are acceptable names . 
  `` soccer '' is a word invented by the british , not the americans , and it comes from `` association football '' , and that was the official name of the sport in the very beginning back in the 19th century . 
  at the time , there were several kinds of football ( including `` rugby football '' , which used to be shortened to `` rugger '' ) , and `` association football '' was the name given to this particular kind of football . 
  in short , `` soccer '' . 
  ok , i am brazilian ( i was born and grew up in brazil ) and got a french citizenship in addition after several years living in france . 
  no french ascendants as far as i know , though . 
  brazil is also a country whose population is mostly of foreign origins , perhaps even more than the us , and a number of migratory inflows have happened in relatively recent history , so i think the countries are quite comparable in that sense . 
  from my perspective , it does seem that brazilians care much less about their origins ( especially if we 're talking about 1/16th fractions and the like ) than americans do , at least from what i 've gathered on the internet . 
  i know i had a great grandmother who came to brazil from portugal , but i would never refer to myself as `` portuguese-brazilian '' ( even because portuguese roots are the most common european origins in the country ) , but it seems even more absurd to claim that i 'm portuguese . 
  by the same token , it strikes me as very weird to read : * americans claiming they 're irish or italian when they 've never been in those countries * the fact that people are more precise about european origins than african ones , for example ( i.e. 
  swedish or danish or spanish or bulgarian origins , but * african * - american ) * claims that your genetic history is somehow linked to cultural traits you have or should have ( e.g. 
  it is expected that irish-americans drink a lot of beer , because that 's what irish people supposedly do , or claiming that your germanic origins are the reason you have great work ethic )  is it derived from a overriding sense of anti-americanism ? 
  i do n't think so , it is more of a pet peeve because some of those claims are just inaccurate . 
  just like that bottle of sparkling wine produced in california might be great , but it is most certainly not champagne . 
   or is it something more along the lines of `` you 're just not europeans . '' ? 
  yes . 
  blood is not everything . 
  * about france : a co-worker in germany saw a map of europe with france highlighted ( because the presentation was about the french market ) . 
  she asked : * why is la r\u00e9union represented on this map ? 
  * ( apparently very proud of saying la r\u00e9union instead of reunion island , even though the rest of the question was in english ) . 
  people awkwardly pointed out that it was just corsica . 
  * bonus response about brazil : i was once carpooling with this guy in france and put some classical music on . 
  he said that was pretty funny and asked why i did not listen to salsa instead , since i was born in brazil and all . 
  serious question . 
  i had to explain that people do not have to only listen to music from their own countries , and that salsa is not even from brazil to begin with ... 
  chile : longland . 
  both scales are equally logical . 
  however , we 're all used to thinking in multiples of 2 , 5 , 10 , 100 . 
  from that perspective , the celsius scale scores a point because of the freezing and boiling temperatures for water ( 0 and 100 ) at 1 atm pressure . 
  for most people used to celsius , it 's normal to roughly describe temperatures using multiples of 5 : -10 : freaking cold . 
  0 : it could snow . 
  5 : consider putting on gloves if you 're riding a bike 10 : consider putting on a jacket 15 - 25 : pretty comfortable 30 : pretty hot 40 : oh god kill me 45 : somewhere in spain in the summer maybe you have similar approximations in \u00b0 f ? 
  however , i 'm pretty sure whichever scale you grow up with will look more `` logical '' to you . 
  mr. and ms. froid have seven kids . 
  what are their names ? 
  sylva , aude , anne , marc , sanson , gilles and laura . 
  explanation : in french there are a bunch of jokes that follow the model `` mr. and ms. < insert name here  have a < son or daughter  , what is < his or her  name ? 
  '' , and then the answer is a * generally real * first name that results in a funny combination with the family name . 
  the one i mentioned results in : sylva , aude , anne , marc , sanson , gilles et laura froid -  * s'il va au danemark sans son gilet , ( i ) l aura froid * -  if he goes to denmark without his vest , he 's gon na be cold . 
  the humour is in the fact that you can build a coherent sentence with a bunch of names . 
  from the perspective of a non-european person who obtained an european citizenship , i am certainly glad that most people i have met are more than happy to have me here . 
  i try my best to add something nice to the society i live in , and i know a lot of people recognize it and appreciate it . 
  to all those people who accept me and my differences , thank you . 
  thank you so much for this comment . 
  as the article says , it is based on an eurobarometer poll . 
  bear in mind that there 's a difference between the average results and the medians for a lot of countries , including france and the uk for example ... 
   in my opinion , you ca n't really be proud of being of a nationality , because you should be proud of something you achieved . 
  while i completely agree with that in theory , and it seems completely logical that people are not proud of things that just fell onto their laps , in practice it certainly doens ' t work that way . 
  just have a look at the millions of rabid football supporters that could n't be prouder of their favorite teams , without ever having stepped onto the field . 
  i think pride is an emotional thing that you can not necessarily correlate with achievements . 
  it might be dumb , but that 's the way it works . 
  there 's [ this map ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/number-of-languages.jpg ) which pretty much gives a good estimate for eu countries . 
  [ full article here ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/average-number-of-languages-spoken-by-the-eu-population/ ) . 
  it seems that 3 and 2 is a pretty good rule of thumb . 
   to be fair , the small details like this have no bearing on the story . 
  but it can really spoil the experience for people who have the knowledge to identify these things . 
  in my personal experience it happens a lot with comic books ( e.g. 
  marvel comics ) . 
  sometimes the inaccuracies are so cringy i just give up on the story . 
  even though spain seems to be the preferred destination , i do n't think swedish tourists abroad are that numerous to begin with . 
  and maybe they concentrate on specific areas so you do n't see them everywhere :p, 
  well i think it 's not exactly the same thing :d the catalan variety is supposed to have some lemon zest in it . 
  i think cr\u00e8me anglaise is more liquid than the typical english custard . 
  there 's also cr\u00e8me catalane , which i guess is common in spain but i think they do n't refer to it as `` catalan cream '' , 
  at the national scale , i think you 're right . 
  compared to the rest of california , i 'm not that sure . 
  but sometimes all you need is a very nice city . 
  and moving to a foreign country can be pretty tough , too ... 
  [ relevant map ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/euro_tourism_003.png ) for this thread ( edit : eu only , not all european countries included ) . 
  i 'm a gay guy who moved from brazil to france in 2008 and things worked out so well that i ended up falling in love with the country and getting a french passport . 
  i would n't say i was never a victim of homophobia in france , or that there are no hate crimes related to that in the country , but it 's a pretty good home for a gay guy . 
  at the european level , you can have a look at [ this map ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=57&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;button= ) to have a general view on regional homophobia . 
  i do n't think the op is worried about safety per se , otherwise leaving the us would be a strange decision . 
  there 's more to homophobia than physical attacks , as you mention . 
  then again , i 'm not sure if places like san francisco are behind western europe in terms of tolerance . 
  if i were from the us , i would probably consider moving to a more progressive american region before moving abroad ( considering only this aspect of life ) . 
  then again , i 've never been to the us , so i would n't know . 
  decathlon and guide du routard : ok . 
  screaming children : could easily be german or italian or others . 
  complaining in french : that 's off topic , 
  decathlon equipment would be included in the few clothing hints i mentioned , and the other three things are not exclusively french . 
  i mean , i can have a good guess when i see someone , but that does n't feel close to 100 % foolproof .
