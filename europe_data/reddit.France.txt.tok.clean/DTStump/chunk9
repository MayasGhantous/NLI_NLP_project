  * other countries could never * hope * to achieve the magnificent levels of smugness we can reach . 
  not often - there are very few hints in gestures or clothing that could help . 
  physical appearance certainly does n't . 
  the eu is an economic partnership as well as a political partnership . 
  it includes , among others , a common foreign and security policy ( cfsp ) . 
  there 's also the 1951 convention of geneva which was signed by poland ( and by a lot of other countries ) according to which ... actually , yes , you do have some responsibilities with regards to refugees . 
   our surname system . 
  a woman 's surname always gives out her marital status because the ending is different when one is married vs. not married . 
  so if she does n't change the surname after marriage , it 's not like a stranger could say it 's 50:50 whether she 's married or not , a stranger would more likely guess unmarried because the ending of the surname gives it out . 
  oh and the shaming for not changing the surname is real too , and sexism disadvantaging both genders in general is at every corner from the moment you 're born interesting . 
  what is the actual ending for married and non-married women ? 
  i 'd like to know that the next time i see a lithuanian woman 's name :p  apologies if that was too much negativity to read  i specifically asked for negativity , lol  no worries . 
  i 'm fine with my height ( 1.83 m , or 6 ' 0 ) . 
  i wish i was a little taller but that 's just because i like playing basketball . 
  the eiffel tower is totally worth the visit . 
  however , imo , * going up there * is definitely not worth it . 
  you 're just paying money and waiting in line to get a view of paris ... * without the eiffel tower * . 
  there are much better viewpoints in the city . 
  they have this electronic device attached to their legs that we use to pay with contactless credit cards . 
  gay guy here too , not worried about my personal safety but i just refuse to go there by principle , even though i would actually be very interested in visiting some russian cities . 
  this is something that can be changed in the future , but while the government overtly equates gays with pedophiles and such , i prefer to `` vote with my wallet '' and spend my tourist money somewhere else . 
   imagine the political consequences for russia if european citizens get attacked . 
  i do n't know , russian hooligans caused a lot of problems recently , in the euro 2014 . 
  i 'm not sure the organization could/would handle the violence caused by some fans . 
   i was invited by the company to come !, 
  anyway , no worries , i wo n't stay too long . 
  you can have the jerb back in about 10 months :p, 
  one thing that i found really surprising when i moved to germany is that in some european countries there are actual [ highway churches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/road_church ) . 
  not sure if that counts . 
  i have a thing for cinnamon , be it in [ speculaas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speculaas ) , mulled wine , on top of a rice pudding , in an apple pie , [ past\u00e9is de nata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastel_de_nata ) , french toasts , in a cup of hot chocolate , with some ice cream on a thin cr\u00eape , in my breakfast muesli ... anything with cinnamon ... * heavy breathing *, 
  i wonder if people from , say , new york are that much more polite and nicer than people from paris . 
  i 'd be surprised . 
  ( but hating on paris and on france in general is a long-lived meme ), 
  i was always very curious about the pb&j combo americans talk about , so i bought some . 
  it was n't the worst . 
   hungarians eppek such a weerd language i cant understand a ward hahaha, 
  spain : lgbt tolerance ( which concerns me directly ) italy : great food , of course switzerland : beautiful landscapes germany : i work there and the salary is great  _  belgium : generally nice people and great beer luxembourg : they have some pretty castles , i guess uk : pop culture and wit, 
  joke . 
  it was a joke . 
  people should just automatically respond `` finland , of course '' to those questions without even bothering to look it up . 
  i 'd mention ~ 150 theaters , ~ 175 museums , ~ 300 art galleries , ~ 250 public libraries , ~ 130 cinemas , a rich and unique history , being an obvious hotspot for music , fashion , cuisine , having the yearly carnival of the cultures , being arguably the lgbt capital of europe , and sticking out as a dream destination for artists in general . 
  or maybe it 's just the muslims , lol, 
  url : en.normandie-tourisme . fr shots fired . 
  i 'm sure it could happen in other countries but something struck me as very specific to france : ( in college ) * `` hey , dtstump , do you smoke ? 
  '' * * `` no , i do n't '' * * '' ... why ? 
  then again , freedom of speech is not absolute anywhere in the world . 
  there are always exceptions to the freedom of speech . 
  absolutely . 
  go to rio , and people * will * touch you all the time . 
  go to bras\u00edlia , and people will often greet you by just saying hi and waving their hands like you 're on the other side of a canyon . 
  big country , big differences . 
  i was born in a city where people * can not * establish communication without touching you in the arm while they talk or something like that . 
  then when i was 7 i moved to a city where people are often cold as ice and have this huge personal space bubble . 
  i ended up becoming more like the second city , but i can completely understand how the first `` works '' . 
  if i interact with a touchy-feely person often i 'll get used to it eventually . 
  if it 's a stranger ... 
  i 'll feel awkward but try my best to get over it without letting that person know he/she is being kind of invasive . 
  they mean no harm . 
  there 's no reason to want them to die in a fire .

  17 here , almost all of western europe . 
  from west to east ( roughly ) : * portugal * spain * france * uk ( england and scotland ) * belgium * the netherlands * luxembourg * switzerland * italy * vatican ( feels like cheating a little bit here ) * germany * austria * slovenia * czech republic * poland * estonia * finland i should add hungary to this list in a few weeks  interesting tidbit : i was born in south america and started travelling in europe only in 2007 . 
  edit : favorite country being france by far - i ended up falling in love with a french person and getting a french passport . 
  now i am a proud binational person . 
  something involving potatoes should do the trick . 
  having a more accepting attitude towards nudity may be true for europe compared to other continents ( but there are very big differences among european countries in this aspect ) , but i feel this is irrelevant with regards to unisex restrooms , simply because there is no nudity in the `` public area '' , normally . 
  you do your stuff in your individual cabin , then come out to the washing area with your clothes on . 
  no urinals . 
  nobody sees anything `` private '' . 
  no , i would like to keep the door closed for a while : nobody gets in , nobody leaves . 
  then try to figure things out internally and work towards a more balanced union , politically and economically . 
  [ relevant smbc ] ( http://smbc-comics.com/comic/an-important-distinction ), 
  i think so , yes . 
  it was relatively expected that jupp\u00e9 would be in the second round , so i think at least a small part of fillon votes were from people who just wanted sarko out . 
  maybe this weekend 's results will shed some light on this . 
  30 year old gay guy here , have been in a relationship for 7 years , not married . 
  not planning on getting married even though it would technically be possible in france and in some other countries . 
  in my view the biggest point of marriage would be for the kids . 
  i think for a child it 's generally better that the parents are married and have a common family name , which the kid also shares . 
  it gives a sense of unity , even though the parents do n't necessarily need it ( they know they 'd be together anyway ) . 
  since i 'm not planning on having kids , i do n't see the point right now . 
  latveria . 
   i know multiculturalism works in countries like america , but that 's really cause they have no culture of their own . 
  holy crap . 
  that 's incredibly patronizing . 
  omaha beach and utah beach come to mind . 
  i 'm surprised at the lack of comments pointing this out . 
  what americans ( for example ) call `` liberal '' is completely different than the classical definition of `` economic liberalism '' . 
  without knowing what the op meant , it 's difficult to answer the question . 
  hah , i clicked on this thread thinking of ludwigshafen and was not disappointed . 
  i live close to it and i do n't think i 've ever seen an uglier city in europe . 
  * i ca n't believe you 've done that . 
  **  :d ** * berlusconi !, 
  i live in germany and i totally believe that statement . 
  i once bought a 500 $ tablet in a saturn store and they would n't accept a visa credit card . 
  i had to withdraw cash to pay for it . 
  lots of places do n't accept credit cards . 
  there 's a low risk that somebody steals your wallet in most places in germany . 
  you pay like a 5 $ fee for withdrawing cash at an atm that does n't have your bank 's name in most cases . 
  for a lot of reason , it just makes sense to always have some cash on you .
