  i 'd make a choice and live with that choice . 
  if it 's somehow to my advantage to keep an illicit second citizenship , i 'd accept whatever constraints that place on me . 
  if the constraints were too great , i 'd give it up .

  lauren southern . 
  lol . 
  so you 're a fan of this stuff ? 
   these `` weird creeps from some odd organisations '' are going to observe ... collect evidence ... where are you getting that from ? 
  the article says :  the group plans to use their 40-meter ( 130-foot ) ship ** to intercept smuggler boats ** before ngo groups can reach them and return them to the libyan coast guard . 
  ...  we will offer the libyan coastguard our support as [ a ] recon ship . 
  we will save anyone we can if we get an sos signal , but we will make sure that they will be brought back to africa . 
  ...  earlier the group had said on its website it would try and ** force ngo ships to change course ** and to sap the financial and organizational resources of the charities . 
  i do n't see anything about collecting evidence ? 
   maybe , but the u.k. authorities in this case would knowingly assist individuals breaking the law of other countries . 
  the uk is only responsible for its relationship to the new citizen . 
  it 's not responsible for that citizen 's relationship to other countries . 
  it 's messy , but it 's not impossible . 
  again , i 'm not clear how govt a finds out that someone is also a citizen of country b. 
  if you 're entering the us , you use your us passport . 
  if you 're entering the eu , you use your eu passport . 
  i have close family in this exact situation .

  i disagree with / u/pindar _ mc on whether it 's worthwhile for an organisation to encourage political participation among ethnic minorities . 
  i think it 's an integration issue , s/he disagrees . 
  bank account = / = citizenship . 
  are you saying that the uk will share with the netherlands a list of people who have taken uk citizenship ? 
  the us taxes its citizens abroad but it 's up to the individual concerned to declare themselves . 
  this has been tightening in recent years . 
  but a us passport holder can take another passport afaik . 
  i know lots of usians with irish passports , for example . 
  more importantly , who decided to name a means of transport after [ icarus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icarus ) ? 
  ** britain faces up to brexit ** as long as the government stays in denial about brexit 's drawbacks , the country is on course for disaster jul 22nd 2017 crisis ? 
  what crisis ? 
  so many have been triggered in britain by the vote a year ago to leave the european union that it is hard to keep track . 
  just last month theresa may was reduced from unassailable iron lady to just-about-managing minority prime minister . 
  her cabinet is engaged in open warfare as rivals position themselves to replace her . 
  the labour party , which has been taken over by a hard-left admirer of hugo ch\u00e1vez , is ahead in the polls . 
  meanwhile a neurotic pro-brexit press shrieks that anyone who voices doubts about the country 's direction is an unpatriotic traitor . 
  britain is having a very public nervous breakdown . 
  the chaos at the heart of government hardly bodes well for the exit negotiations with the eu , which turned to detailed matters this week and need to conclude in autumn 2018 . 
  but the day-to-day disorder masks a bigger problem . 
  despite the frantic political activity in westminster -- the briefing , back-stabbing and plotting -- the country has made remarkably little progress since the referendum in deciding what form brexit should take . 
  all versions , however `` hard '' or `` soft '' , have drawbacks ( see article ) . 
  yet britain 's leaders have scarcely acknowledged that exit will involve compromises , let alone how damaging they are likely to be . 
  the longer they fail to face up to brexit 's painful trade-offs , the more brutal will be the eventual reckoning with reality . 
  ** winging it ** in the 13 months since the referendum , the awesome complexity of ending a 44-year political and economic union has become clear . 
  britain 's position on everything from mackerel stocks to nuclear waste is being worked out by a civil service whose headcount has fallen by nearly a quarter in the past decade and which has not negotiated a trade deal of its own in a generation . 
  responsibility for brexit is shared -- or , rather , fought over and sometimes dropped -- by several different departments . 
  initially britain 's decision not to publish a detailed negotiating position , as the eu had , was put down to its desire to avoid giving away its hand . 
  it now seems that britain triggered exit talks before working out where it stood . 
  the head of its public-spending watchdog said recently that when he asked ministers for their plan he was given only `` vague '' assurances ; he fears the whole thing could fall apart `` at the first tap '' . 
  as the scale of the task has become apparent , so has the difficulty of britain 's position . 
  before the referendum michael gove , a leading brexiteer in the cabinet , predicted that , `` the day after we vote to leave , we hold all the cards . '' it is not turning out like that . 
  so far , where there has been disagreement britain has given way . 
  the talks will be sequenced along the lines suggested by the eu . 
  britain has conceded that it will pay an exit bill , contrary to its foreign secretary 's suggestion only a week ago that eurocrats could `` go whistle '' for their money . 
  the hobbled mrs may has appealed to other parties to come forward with ideas on how to make brexit work . 
  labour , which can hardly believe that it is within sight of installing a radical socialist prime minister in 10 downing street , is unsurprisingly more interested in provoking an election . 
  but cross-party gangs of remainer mps are planning to add amendments to legislation , forcing the government to try to maintain membership of euratom , for instance , which governs the transit of radioactive material in europe . 
  even within the government , the prime minister 's lack of grip means that cabinet ministers have started openly disagreeing about what shape brexit should take . 
  philip hammond , the chancellor , has been sniped at because he supports a long transition period to make brexit go smoothly -- a sensible idea which is viewed with suspicion by some brexiteers , who fear the transition stage could become permanent . 
  the reopening of the debate is welcome , since the hard exit proposed in mrs may 's rejected manifesto would have been needlessly damaging . 
  but there is a lack of realism on all sides about what britain 's limited options involve . 
  there are many ways to leave the eu , and none is free of problems . 
  the more britain aims to preserve its economic relationship with the continent , the more it will have to follow rules set by foreign politicians and enforced by foreign judges ( including on the sensitive issue of freedom of movement ) . 
  the more control it demands over its borders and laws , the harder it will find it to do business with its biggest market . 
  it is not unpatriotic to be frank about these trade-offs . 
  indeed , it is more unpatriotic to kid voters into thinking that brexit has no drawbacks at all . 
  the government has not published any estimates of the impact of the various types of brexit since the referendum , but academic studies suggest that even the `` softest '' option -- norwegian-style membership of the european economic area -- would cut trade by at least 20 % over ten years , whereas the `` hardest '' exit , reverting to trade on the world trade organisation 's terms , would reduce trade by 40 % and cut annual income per person by 2.6 % . 
  as the economy weakens , these concerns will weigh more heavily . 
  britain 's economy is growing more slowly than that of any other member of the eu . 
  the election showed that its voters are sick of austerity . 
  our own polling finds that , when forced to choose , a majority now favours a soft brexit , inside the single market ( see article ) . 
  ** back in play ** a febrile mood in the country , and the power vacuum in downing street , mean that all options are back on the table . 
  this is panicking people on both sides of the debate . 
  some hardline brexiteers are agitating again for britain to walk away from the negotiations with no deal , before voters have a change of heart . 
  some remainers are stepping up calls for a second referendum , to give the country a route out of the deepening mess . 
  as the negotiations blunder on and the deadline draws nearer , such talk will become only more fevered . 
  so it is all the more crucial that all sides face up to the real and painful trade-offs that brexit entails . 
  the longer britain keeps its head in the sand , the more likely it is to end up with no deal , and no preparations for the consequences . 
  that would bring a crisis of a new order of magnitude . 
  how ? 
  tax is based on residency not citizenship . 
  it 's never clear to me how the government of a country that does n't allow dual nationality knows about a second passport . 
   in the u.k. however , the government 's right to carry out what many will see as a reasonable ** immigration check ** ...  ** british expats ** meanwhile , will be personally worried ... :-) even politico.eu does makes the distinction between expats ( british people ) and immigrants ( rest of eu ) . 
  because scottish passports and residency cards are a thing ?
