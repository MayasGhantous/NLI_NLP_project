  i think they need to envisage a shared court , separate from the ecj , to deal with citizens ' rights . 
   one of the thorniest issues is likely to be money - or what 's sometimes called the `` divorce bill '' the eu will present to britain . 
  this should n't be thorny at all . 
  give the issue to some civil service wonks and get them to trash it out fairly . 
  it could be dealt with simply and objectively . 
  of course it will be a huge issue , because the uk pols have made it a rabble-rousing point of contention . 
   neither the uk nor the eu , which includes member state the republic of ireland , want to see a re-erection of the fortified borders that once divided the island and caused so many decades of bloody conflict . 
  trade between ni and roi to be monitored digitally/electronically . 
  some imaginative use of passive transmitters on produce that passes the border . 
  there 's a huge risk of smuggling , which is already quite significant . 
  for people : the common travel area agreement to be respected with eu `` immigration '' to be controlled at irish points of departure for other eu destinations ( much as us immigration is dealt with in irish airports currently ) . 
   `` the meeting with the french central bank was the worst i have had anywhere in the eu . 
  they are in favour of the hardest brexit . '', 
  those strange times when the interests of hard brexiteers and the french central bank align ... could this be exaggerated by the person reporting it ? 
  might he be a remainer who wants to promote a softer brexit ? 
   mr browne , who was a liberal democrat minister in the coalition under david cameron and nick clegg , said hostility to the uk is not confined to a few officials but represents a `` whole-of-france collective endeavour '' . 
  it 's true . 
  i 've started producing english muffins as an import-substitution business for when brexit kicks in . 
  one neighbour is brewing flat warm beer , and the other is developing a haggis farm . 
  all of this mandated by the government . 
   `` it was indeed france that organized this , '' he said , adding that `` not a single german '' was directly involved , but only french police collaborating with the nazis . 
  this is significant because marine le pen said earlier this year that `` france was not responsible for the vel d'hiv roundup '' ( la france n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable du v\u00e9l ' d\u2019hiv ) . 
  macron is directly contradicting her . 
  projecting much ? 
  almost identical . 
  yeah , i 've cycled a lot with bike seats and i seldom go over 20kph . 
  even by myself i seldom exceed 35kph . 
  i 'll have your portion so . 
  i 'd happily eat it by itself tbh . 
  not a big fan of meat but i 've always enjoyed blood . 
   `` what the hell is black pudding ? '' asks anna , a 15-year-old at thomas clarkson academy . 
  `` it 's disgusting . '' i 'm sorry anna , but you 'll have to leave . 
  black pudding is delicious . 
  very ambitious parents with a strong educational ethic . 
  puy du fou is good fun but it 's heavy on propaganda . 
  the shows all fit with the political views of its founder , philippe de villiers . 
  it 's a good opportunity to discuss historical revisionism with your kids . 
  the viking show is awesome . 
   if you have no kids i would go to parc asterix instead of disneyland . 
  came here to say that . 
  i 've stopped bringing my kids to disney because it 's basically just one big shop . 
  parc ast\u00e9rix is more laid back . 
  at age 40 you should send your music collection to me . 
  i 'll take care of it for you . 
   i did n't know daft punk were french . 
  that explains them being chosen despite being a shitty kraftwerk copycat . 
  daft punk have won more music awards outside france than in france . 
  they 're very popular internationally . 
  if all you hear is a kraftwerk copycat , you maybe do n't know either band very well , or your musical sensibilities are more refined than the rest of the music-buying public . 
  bof , daft punk has basically reached national treasure status in france . 
  they were admitted into the ordre des arts et des lettres in 2010 . 
  bangalter and de homem-christo were individually awarded the rank of chevalier . 
  daft punk has been going for 24 years already ... 
  easyjet specifically has taken advantage of cabotage by running the same plane on multiple routes in a given day . 
  one route they had some years back was paris-nice , nice-frankfurt , frankfurt-nice , nice-paris . 
  vitriol attacks have a long history in britain . 
  that 's amazing . 
  strangely prophetic with the daft punk bit at the end of today 's parade . 
  [ aux armes et c\u00e6tera ] ( https://youtu.be/ff9re3qf4gy ), 
  good reviews [ here ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.ie/restaurant_review-g187147-d719447-reviews-le_temps_des_cerises-paris_ile_de_france.html ), 
  vaguely remember it though i was too young to go . 
  ateing and drinking in it , so there is . 
  from when he was a td ( member of irish parliament ) : [ michael d rocking in the d\u00e1il ] ( https://g.co/kgs/3w4xqb ), 
  lol . 
  `` markets '' is just as much a buzzword . 
  given declining real wages , we must assume most inflation in the uk is imported inflation rather than wage driven . 
  imported inflation primarily operates via the exchange rate . 
  if we look at sterling 's behaviour over the last 13 months , we can see two sharp drops that tie in to the general downward trend of the currency . 
  what coincides with those sharp drops ? 
  ( 1 ) the outcome of brexyref . 
  ( 2 ) may 's speech to the tory party conference last october , where it became clear she was pursuing a ` hard brexit ' strategy . 
  more generally , the pound is very sensitive to news about brexit , see [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/09/pound-falls-low-theresa-may-brexit-ftse-100-high ) , [ this ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/2ff18be7-3ea2-32ba-bb69-7800d3394078?mhq5j=e1 ) , and [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pound-sterling-volatile-deal-brexit-a7715061.html ) for example . 
  brexit , whether it be a buzzword or a process , is supposed to increase uk workers ' wages by reducing competition for jobs . 
  it 's currently doing the opposite , and this will be politically difficult for the uk government . 
   inflation is having an effect where 's inflation coming from ? 
  the last time i checked , italy was one of the hardest hit by the migrant crisis . 
  i do n't think op wrote the article ? 
  it was a good-humoured remark , but take offense if you must . 
  does it have an `` up and out '' button ? 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd had a long day . 
  brexit is having a negative effect on workers ' incomes so far ... will be politically difficult . 
  only if you whisper your outrage . 
  did i read that real income is still falling though ? 
  could we add a guinness pipeline while we 're at it ? 
  asking for a friend . 
  yes . 
  he 's another leak from the_d ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ickfest, 
  in fact you are a cunt . 
  thanks for confirming . 
  cunt . 
  you 're correct of course . 
  against paranoiacs ? 
  yeah maybe . 
  oh you 're one of those obsessives . 
  lmao . 
   replacement is the only way . 
  what 's replacement ? 
   not sure what difference it would make though ? 
  `` all you can eat sushi '' at 10 euro is unlikely to be very nice sushi .
