  do n't be saying that on reddit or you might jeopardise the brexit negotiations . 
  you got a source for whatever you 're talking about ? 
  the great repeal bill : https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/brexit-explained/brexit-explained-great-repeal-bill, 
   the ecj having sovereignty over uk courts ... post brexit , something that will never happen ? 
  except maybe for euratom ? 
   i would n't say 10 $ all you can eat lunch classifies as `` high-class expensive '' . 
  that sounds more like a generic `` asian buffet '' than a sushi restaurant . 
  the difference with a kebab shop is that the asian buffet is intended as a sit-down place , whereas the kebab is meant to be eaten on the street . 
  my local town complains about subway , for example , because of the litter consequences . 
  i 'd see the same concerns around kebabs but not around asian food . 
  i 've tried snails a few times , most recently because one of my kids wanted to try them so we shared a plate . 
  will probably try the cuisses de grenouille this year because they 're next on his list . 
  yes it is . 
  the projections for nigeria made in 2010 were already revised downward in 2015 . 
  people who show you scary charts of linear ( or worse , exponential ) population growth are either stupid or disingenuous . 
  such charts help to focus our attention but they 're rarely realistic . 
   i just find it weird that the youngest support such an authoritarian party . 
  young people generally like simple narratives and solutions , whether they be on the right or left . 
  as they gain more life experience their views will moderate . 
  the question was basically `` the marshall plan cost 150 billion dollars . 
  how much is the g20 prepared to pay to fix africa ? '', 
  macron 's answer is that france and other countries have been paying for decades , but that the marshall plan is not an appropriate analogy and it 's not possible to solve the problem by throwing money at it . 
  he then lists the challenges faced by africa today : * weak governments * complex transitions to democracy * demographic transition * trafficking ( drugs , weapons , people , cultural artifacts ) * violent fundamentalism , islamic terrorism he says we need something much more sophisticated than the marshall plan . 
  but social media distills this down to `` 7 or 8 kids per woman '' ... 
  i 'm more worried about how stupid we 're becoming than i am about an african population boom .

  more and more we 're hearing about transitional arrangements with something like the eea ... three years , five years , indefinite ...

  churchill your ass . 
  http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107219 thatcher was a major proponent of the single market . 
   the uk never would have left the bloc just 10 years after joining . 
  why not ? 
  you were only in it because of strong growth ? 
  why did n't you leave instead of pursuing deeper and more complete economic integration ? 
  you 're not supporting your initial statement at all . 
  your problem , and that of the uk more generally , is that you ca n't say much ` as one voice ' . 
  you 're deeply divided over brexit , you have a hung parliament , your cabinet is even deeply divided . 
  there 's some half-baked notion of sailing britain off into the atlantic ( or pacific ) to become some lightning rod of free trade deals . 
  but this ignores the reality of trade around the world , which is very gravitational and somewhat cultural . 
  unfortunately for britain , most of the cultural benefits are already enjoyed , and short of some transportation breakthroughs , the gravity benefits are all in europe . 
  about 90 % of your experts , the people who think about trade and economics , see brexit as a bad thing . 
   with its own economy stuck in a rut , britain saw france and germany posting a strong post-war recovery and ** forming a powerful alliance ** , and changed its mind . 
  economic reasons of course , but it was more than that . 
  also , this piece completely overlooks thatcher 's promotion of the single market . 
  why was she so interested in a single market , do you think ? 
  at that point european economic growth was already lagging behind the so-called tiger economies . 
  by your argument , thatcher should 've left the eec and entered some proto-asean ? 
  why did she want to stay with boring old 2 % to 4 % a year europe ?

   it 's common knowledge lol . 
  `` trying '' being the operative word . 
  honestly they sound like a bunch of internet tough guys who 've fallen upon a way to make money . 
  they 'll continue to `` try '' and they 'll continue to fail . 
   the uk only joined the eec to be linked with countries that at the time were among the fastest growing in the world . 
  citation needed . 
  churchill had a vision of a united europe . 
  thatcher had a vision of a truly integrated single market . 
  neither of them were only concerned with the fastest growing economies . 
   this is the forecast . 
  by whom ? 
  link ? 
   live the rest of your life with paid protection like ayaan hirsi ali .

  you seriously do n't think anyone is insulting islam in france ? 
  lol . 
  the_d is leaking again . 
  grow up . 
  of course people still insult islam in france . 
  charlie hebdo is n't the only provocateur . 
  but according to foreigners we 're all living under shakira law and wearing jihads on our heads . 
   lukasik , a former champion wrestler , stood as an independent councillor in enfield in 2014 . 
  during the campaign lukasik told the barnet and whetstone press that he wanted to help foreigners : `` we , foreigners , english people , must find some solution to live together peacefully . '' what a plonker ... 
   which that person will never see ? 
  he spends a lot of time on twitter , so if this gets picked up there he might see it . 
   there are already blasphemy `` laws '' in france wtf ?

  does that mean there are 800k cars lying around idle ? 
  i could take a couple off their hands , to be helpful ... 
  like i said , if you have concerns you can do separate vaccines . 
  being worried about mmr is not a reason to avoid all vaccinations . 
  it 'll just take a little longer . 
  my basic point : you choose how to do it in terms of multi or single vaccines , but you still have to vaccinate your kids . 
   there is absolutely no scientific reason to . 
  understood .
