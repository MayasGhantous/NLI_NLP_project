  just saying there are options for those who are concerned ( my kids all had mmr when they were little ) . 
  here 's a french one i like that is n't listed : * revenons a nos moutons * - let 's get back to our sheep . 
  meaning , let 's return to the subject at hand . 
  it 's from a play where a merchant has been conned out of sheets by one person and out of sheep by another . 
  he brings the two cases before a judge , but gets confused between the sheets and the sheep , causing the judge to say at one point `` get back to your sheep '' . 
   a controversial vaccine that we do n't fully understand . 
  which vaccine is that ? 
  we have an excellent understanding of childrens ' vaccines . 
  you do n't have to use the triple vaccine ( mmr ) if you do n't want to . 
  you can use separate jabs or other combinations . 
   the saudi royals act as a needed check on the influential religious aspect of saudi society . 
  i thought the religious elements were there as a bulwark against democratic movements among the saudi people ? 
  the royals give the wahabbis a free hand , and in return the religious leaders promote the saudi status quo . 
  when will the oil money run out ? 
   many , including myself , dislike foreign money influencing politics , especially in a small nation like ireland . 
  i take it you 're equally disturbed by the money and support that flows into ireland from us-based pro-life groups ? 
  this has been obvious since the 1990s , no ? 
   domestic institutions are the key , and he bang on right about that . 
  desperately thin on detail however . 
  cumming 's points are potentially interesting , but twitter is such a poor medium that i ca n't really tell . 
   when goldsmiths and scriveners , the 17th century forerunners of bankers , first introduced cheques , it was a striking act of creativity . 
  this seems very late , given what the italians were doing from the 12th century onward . 
  netherlands : nice roads but near the cities it 's like a free for all . 
  nobody respecting lanes on the motorway ; not much signalling to change lane . 
  uk : road quality poor . 
  a lot of people choose a lane and then stick to it , despite traveling at 30 + kmph below the speed limit . 
  the multi stage roundabouts with stop lights are a headwreck . 
  ireland : ditto on the multistage roundabouts with stop lights . 
  country roads can be really dodgy but rated for 80km or even 100km - locals get very impatient driving behind me :-) belgium : not much road signage . 
  road quality poor . 
  drivers quite variable . 
  germany : love the autobahn but most people have a faster car than i do . 
   every traffic jam we found had a peage booth in the end . 
  there 's a lot of that , especially in summer when people unfamiliar with the system get in the wrong lane , then get stuck and have to change lane or deal with a human operator . 
  you can get a badge that allows you to pass through the tolls at 30 kph . 
  the name 's lanley , lyle lanley , and i come before you good people tonight with an idea . 
  probably the greatest ... aww it 's not for you . 
  it 's more of a shelbyville idea ... 
   low energy fakenews lol . 
  outing yourself in three/four words . 
   theresa may as not looked for , or is receiving any support from the liberal democrats . 
  reported in the times today . 
  here 's the [ uk politics thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6l5mmb/desperate_may_asks_lib_dems_for_help_to_win/ ) . 
  alcohol no , but free alcohol yes . 
  brexit is slowly tearing the british political class apart . 
  massive infighting among the cabinet , theresa may looking for help from the lib dems , and corbyn sacking front benchers for speaking out of turn . 
  it 's a constant shitstorm . 
  \\* * remembers self as a 15 year old ... * \\* * nods vigorously ... *, 
   germany did n't cause the chaos in lybia , ~ ~ france did ~ ~ the un security council and nato did . 
  some more detail from [ the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40481325 ) :  prosecutors say syed 's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack , and while he initially boasted of working with others , those people did not materialise . 
   instead , over the summer of last year , he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry . 
   after he went online looking for help , a purported jihadist fighting overseas , known only as abu isa , introduced him to another extremist going by the name abu yusuf . 
   this second man was , in fact , a group of mi5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with syed . 
  here 's one of my favourite irish websites , [ dalta\u00ed na gaeilge ] ( http://www.daltai.com/ ) . 
  it 's run out of new jersey . 
  i especially like the [ proverb of the week ] ( http://www.daltai.com/proverbs/cat02.htm%23section09/ ) . 
  * your friend and your enemy believe you will never die . 
   i 'll point to this as a utter waste of funds . 
  it 'll have to happen though , and i doubt it will for a very long time . 
    james joyce  ... who died in the irish free state , a dominion of the british empire . 
  wrong on both counts . 
  joyce died in z\u00fcrich in 1941 but he outlived saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann , which was dissolved in 1939 . 
   it 's a language that is rudimentary how do you mean it 's ` rudimentary ' ? 
   the `` gaelscoil movement '' is simply parents with no choice but to put their kids in irish speaking schools because the english speaking ones are full . 
  no , it 's a mix of gaeilgeoir\u00ed and middle-class parents who want their kids to have educational advantages . 
  a lot of the gaelscoileanna are oversubscribed . 
  there 's no magic money tree you know ... 
  reverse cult of personality . 
  hungarian politicians are weird . 
  i looked at the headline and thought `` this is michael gove '' , and sure enough ... 
  look it up yourself . 
   merkel literally invited anyone from the third world to come . 
  except that she invited refugees and there 's a definition of that term . 
  strange that you 're complaining about people purposely forgetting and then you * misremember * yourself . 
  this is awesome !, 
  the most powerful person in the state has doubts , but still the view of the majority holds sway !, 
  that 's how it 's supposed to work people . 
  exactly . 
  to be blunt , these fuckers are always there . 
  you may think you 've defeated them , but it 's temporary . 
  its impressive but even a 0.3 % increase in interest rates would turn that sharply upward . 
  i expect that 'll happen by december . 
   it implies that investigators are being less critical of other parties . 
  what implies this ? 
  politicians who are close to macron are also being investigated . 
  they 've behaved impeccably and stepped down to allow the investigation , unlike mlp who tries to hide all the time . 
  despite having nine goalies , apparently . 
  sounds like you 'd be happier if they were two good looking dudes . 
  there 's more to it than just low interest rates though . 
  the uk interest rate has [ flatlined since early 2009 ] ( http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5943926481abef23008b458f-1188/screen%20shot%202017-06-16%20at%20083103.png ) . 
  the savings ratio , in contrast , [ has fluctuated since 2009 ] ( https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_rkvpms7vw@2x.png ) albeit with a downward trend . 
  the real steep decline in savings ratio kicks in in early 2015 . 
   ms le pen , 48 , has also denied any wrongdoing and has said the case is politically motivated . 
  that 's a predictable claim , but if the investigators can prove wrongdoing , it does n't matter what the motivation is because the fn has broken the law . 
  from what i understand there 's clear evidence that certain staffers were working for the national party rather than the meps . 
  as to the political motivation , modem politicians are also being investigated - two resigned from macron 's cabinet recently . 
  what 's the motivation for investigating them ? 
  you are a shining example of a principled politician . 
  :-) it used to be common for a company to offer an extra day if a holiday came close to a weekend - e.g. 
  if there 's a tue/thur holiday , the company would give the mon/fri to enable employees to `` faire le pont '' - make the bridge - between the holiday and the weekend .
