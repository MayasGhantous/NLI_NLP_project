  it 's less common now because people have more holidays so they 're expected to take a day off if they want to make the bridge . 
  in france the number of days off work depends on the calendar . 
  between 1 and 4 holidays will fall on a weekend ( 2.29 is the arithmetic average ) , so some companies often provide supplemental days to compensate for this . 
  happy and glorious . 
  french media are pretty pissed off about it .

  [ parmentier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antoine-augustin_parmentier ) was the big potato advocate in france .

  [ lawrence wilkerson , who was the chief aide to former us secretary of state colin powell , said the remote uk-administered military base in the indian ocean was used as a back-up location for `` nefarious activities '' , such as the questioning of prisoners in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , for weeks at a time .

  david mcwilliams , a pop economist , [ wrote a piece recently ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/demographics-are-shifting-towards-a-united-ireland-we-must-have-a-plan-35865222.html ) about the demographics . 
  the key points from the uk census 2011 :  of those aged over 90 in northern ireland , 64 % are protestant and 25 % are catholic . 
  a total of 9 % had no declared religion . 
   among children and babies born since 2008 , the picture changes dramatically . 
  the corresponding figure is 31 % protestant and 44 % catholic . 
  in one ( admittedly long ) lifetime , the catholic population in the youngest cohort has nearly doubled , while the protestant cohort has more than halved . 
  long term it seems inevitable that there will be a majority in favour of unification . 
  in the nearer term , a lot depends on how brexit shapes up . 
   have dominated this sub i think you perceive them as dominating because they 're the posts you 're most invested/interested in . 
  a quick look at the front page now suggests 3/25 brexit-related posts . 
  like i said earlier , corbyn has stated he will follow labour party policy , and this is to defend the falklands . 
  he 's not selling anyone out . 
  if you want to look at old stories , you should investigate sammy wilson 's support for a plan to ` resettle ' northern irish catholics in the 1990s . 
  where 's sammy wilson now ? 
   the presence of the large us navy base on the island . 
  also some cia facilities afaik ... 
  this is n't about partisanship . 
  i have plenty of problems with corbyn , including his attitudes to the eu and nuclear power , but i simply do n't spend any time thinking about the falklands . 
  i would n't really care if may proposed to sell the falklands to argentina , simply because they 're irrelevant to my life . 
   true , but i think it 's safe to say if it was may you would be all over it . 
  plenty of more important reasons to have issues with may . 
   so because it 's about corbyn it does n't count ? 
  not what i wrote . 
  nobody gives a shit about the falklands until it 's time to bash corbyn over some hypothetical shit that was n't even relevant to the recent campaign . 
  [ thornberry said she 'd defend the falklands . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/14/emily-thornberry-hardens-labour-party-line-on-falkland-islands ) that was the labour policy . 
  corbyn said he 'd follow policy . 
  have you honestly seen anyone give two fucks about the falklands in the last 30 years other than as a stick to beat jeremy corbyn with ? 
   i find it absolutely amazing that in the 21st century we are still arguing about whether it 's okay for businesses to discriminate on the basis of nationality . 
  another reason why `` no deal '' is worse than a `` bad deal '' . 
  at present , eu legislation should prevent such discrimination . 
  post-brexit , and the absence of an agreement , it wo n't be the case i expect .

   the headscarf is still `` triggering '' for many people including obviously those in poland , they 're teenagers . 
  maybe they did n't expect polish people would be so fucking scared of headscarves ? 
   perhaps they should have left them off or not gone at all ?

   somewhat related , there 's a very good fantasy movie based on the beast called `` brotherhood of the wolf '' .

   not being from northern or southern ireland ... .  ireland for example was a backwards land devoid of civilisation 4/10 poor quality trolling gaining 2 points ; but 2 bonus points for pushing the northern/southern ireland button . 
  ah , that 's interesting . 
  a vote winner in that case i guess . 
  aragorn has really let himself go . 
   do n't smoke , do n't drink , do n't do drugs , get run over by the bus . 
  so enjoy yourself a bit . 
  smoke a little , drink a little , etc. 
  and then if you do get run over by the bus or killed by some looney , at least you 've had some fun . 
  it 's pointless to live a life of ascetic deprivation simply to prolong a life of ascetic deprivation , especially with all those dangerous buses and lunatics trying to shorten it for you . 
  edit : to the excessively literal minded posters , i 'm not advocating smoking and drinking per se . 
  i 'm saying that if op fears being run over by a bus after depriving himself of things he wants , he should deprive himself less and then maybe he 'll be less fearful . 
  life is really short in the grander scheme of things , and theres a balance to be struck between enjoying your youth and tacking ten years on at the end when your knees and eyesight are shot .

  the united kingdom 's terrorism act 2000 defined terrorism as follows : 1 . 
  in this act `` terrorism '' means the use or threat of action where : a. the action falls within subsection 2 , b. the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public and c. the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political , religious or ideological cause . 
  action falls within this subsection if it : a. involves serious violence against a person , b. involves serious damage to property , c. endangers a person 's life , other than that of the person committing the action , d. creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public or e. is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system . 
  us definitions are quite similar .
