  they want to pursue their studies in english , but not in britain because the costs are too uncertain . 
  yes , that 's what i 've understood . 
  no central system so if your alarm or a neighbour 's goes off , you might take action , but there 's no generalised alert :-( those poor people ... 
  i think i subconsciously perceive them as adverts , so my eyes pass over them . 
  no that was an appropriate reference . 
  the prisoners ' dilemma is about cooperation versus defection . 
  your polity had an interest in long-term cooperation for mutual benefit thanks to your bizarre aquaphilic landscape . 
  there 's an aspect of the tragedy of the commons as well , but in this case it seems that cooperation was successful and tragedy averted . 
  well yeah , but successive uk govts relinquished more control than was necessary . 
  it 's convenient to blame europe , but your own leadership has had a huge role in this . 
  early reports suggesting there was no fire alarm , or at least it failed to go off . 
  horrifying for the residents and the people of london . 
  my thoughts are with them . 
  nope mate , i 'm rubber and you 're glue . 
  i heard you 've already started the practicals on your own . 
  or at least you tried , but were n't quite able to make it with your pet goat . 
  better luck in a few years . 
  enjoy middle school !, 
   when i debunked your bullshit examples you stopped arguing . 
  no that 's not what happened . 
  you engaged in hyperbole and personal attacks and i lost interest . 
  cheerio !, 
  okay thanks for the clarification . 
  you explained your entire argument in less than four minutes ? 
  lol . 
  we 're leaving in a few . 
  play at the kids ' school . 
  no , it 's a half hour later than i thought . 
  the uk is in the wto both as part of the eu and separately as the uk . 
  it wo n't need to renegotiate afaik . 
  in your math analogy , you 're killing 90 % not 2 % of the male population . 
  your argument rests on an assumption that men are inherently superior to women . 
  you claim there are boy jobs and girl jobs , \u00e0 la theresa may . 
  try explaining it to a close female relative and see how that goes . 
  did you say wiped out most , yes or no . 
  again , it should n't matter if there 's a biological difference between men and women . 
  if women 's biological urges are so strong as to deter them from a career in politics , we should n't expect more than the quota of women . 
  but in both cases we have more than the quota !, 
  how to explain it ? 
  your argument seems to have become : * men and women are biologically different , but women can override these biological differences if there is a quota in place . 
  * so your alleged biological imperatives are in fact * contingent imperatives * that are subject to the presence or absence of a quota system . 
  if a quota is in place , women can cast off the shackles of their gender and aspire to roles in the political system of the country . 
  in fact , you 're basically arguing in favour of quotas . 
  anyway , i 'm off now because i have an appointment . 
  cheers !, 
  firm , leather-clad grasp of the issues . 
   why do i need to contradict that data that agrees with me ? 
  you wrote that greater female participation is also due to the genocide that ** `` wiped out most of the male population '' . 
  ** the data show clearly that `` most of the male population '' is a wild overstatement . 
  the data does n't agree with you at all . 
  are you seriously saying that a 2 % difference in male/female population has a 30 % + effect on political participation rates ? 
   if you were n't dishonest you should have said `` oh by the way , they got a bunch of mandatory seats for women + a genocide that reduced the male population '' from the start instead of pretending that 's there are n't any details that might slightly skew the result . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  the fact of the matter is that i tried to answer your request for clarification but you had already deleted the request in order to accuse me of dishonesty . 
  fuck that it 's bullshit . 
   lol , are you that sexist you think voters vote for their own sex ? 
    voters vote for who they think is best , not for their own sex . 
  this has to do with a bigger percentage of people wanting to join politics , not people voting . 
    do you seriously vote for candidates solely based on their sex ? 
  you 're tilting at windmills . 
  let 's clear this up for you . 
  you 've claimed that ** female participation is greater because there are more women than men ** . 
  i have given you data that show that the difference in number of women/number of men in the upper age cohorts is about 80k of a total population in those ages of around 7.5 million . 
  you 've said nothing to contradict these data . 
  these data refute your claim `` wiped out the male population '' . 
  i chose these age cohorts not * because of the way they vote * , but to represent likelihood of choosing politics as a career . 
  that 's because people under 16 are unlikely to run for parliament . 
   considering how blatantly dishonest you were about rwanda my guess is i wo n't be surprised with the results . 
  i was n't dishonest . 
  you asked for clarification and i tried to provide it , but ** you had already deleted your comment ** . 
  you can stop the personal attacks and try to defend your initial claim with logic and reason . 
  if women are biologically different and therefore less likely to pursue a career in politics : 1 . 
  the logical conclusion is that women in rwanda are biologically different from other women . 
  just because there 's a 24/80 quota does n't explain why over 60 % of seats are filled by women . 
  there must be a biological explanation !, 
  we must assume that women in bolivia are also biologically different from other women . 
   if the eu is perfect for everyone nobody has ever said that , afaik . 
  most countries would say that eu advantages outweigh eu disadvantages . 
   wiped out most of the male population ? 
  okay , as you 're so insistent , let 's look at that one . 
  based on your biological argument , we should expect female participation to diminish as the effects of the genocide recede and the m/f proportion of the population rebalances . 
  but , as you 've no doubt read , female participation has been growing , yes ? 
  for good measure , let 's look at the assertion :  wiped out most of the male population ? 
  from [ indexmundi ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/rwanda/age_structure.html ) : 15-24 years : 18.87 % ( male 1,226,141 / female 1,225,009 ) 25-54 years : 32.93 % ( male 2,142,936 / female 2,134,064 ) 55-64 years : 4.09 % ( male 249,447 / female 282,225 ) 65 years and over : 2.58 % ( male 138,834 / female 195,831 ) ( 2016 est. ), 
  where 's the massive difference between men and women among the voting age population ? 
  i count about 80,000 difference ? 
  how is that wiped out ? 
  now , what have you learned about bolivian women ? 
   i was waiting for you to reply , you did n't , so i deleted and resended it to alert you . 
  and then accused me of dishonesty . 
  yeah nice one . 
  either rwandan women have the same biological interests as other women , in which case it does n't matter what quotas are in place , we should n't expect much over the quota . 
  or your * biological argument * is garbage . 
   seriously ? 
  you 're going to be that dishonest so as to intentionally omit those critical details ? 
  fuck your accusations of dishonesty . 
  i was writing a reply when you deleted your comment you sly cunt . 
  lol . 
  there are reserved seats in the parliament for women how many ? 
  and what proportion of seats go to women ?
