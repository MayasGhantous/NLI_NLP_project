  so rwandan and bolivian women are somehow biologically different from women from other countries ? 
  as / u/gensek says , it 's an assistant , specifically a civil servant or diplomat who undertakes preparatory work prior to a summit conference . 
  from the sherpas who help mountaineers to get up everest . 
   why ? 
  if there are more qualified women , you should n't have 50-50 representation . 
    if treatment , rights , and opportunity are genuinely equal , we should expect representation on average and over the long term to be 50/50 . 
   gender parity means equal treatment , rights and opportunity , and not 50-50 representation . 
  but if treatment , rights , and opportunity are genuinely equal , we should expect representation on average and over the long term to be 50/50 . 
  otherwise there 's a bug . 
  one-time payment . 
  i know right ? 
  he could at least give it a go . 
  maybe get a couple of hand puppets ? 
  i think the eu27 would be quite happy with the uk asking for an eea deal . 
  it 's the least economically damaging outcome for everyone , afaics . 
  what wo n't be acceptable to the eu27 is cherry picking , but barnier is fairly clear that he wo n't entertain that . 
  imo , it would be good to see some cross-party group set up to negotiate two options ( hard and soft ) and bring them to a referendum in 2019 . 
  a week ago i 'd 've agreed with you . 
  in the current turbulence i 'm not so sure . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area i honestly ca n't say how likely it is , but the mood in the uk appears to have turned against a so-called `` hard brexit '' . 
  i do n't expect the final bill to be that large even if there 's a ` wto rules ' outcome . 
  the uk has invested a lot in the eu over the years and that will be recognized even if there 's no ongoing agreement . 
  if the uk ends up in some sort of eea arrangement the final bill will be relatively insignificant . 
  michel barnier , the eu 's chief brexit negotiator , sat down with the financial times and other european newspapers on monday to give his first interview since the process of the uk leaving the bloc began . 
  here is the edited transcript of mr barnier 's introductory remarks and exchange with reporters . 
  ** michel barnier : ** we 're at an important moment , because the decision of the uk to quit the eu is a serious decision . 
  right now it 's about putting it in place , without wasting time . 
  here , as [ jean-claude juncker , european commission president ] , said , and as i 've said myself several times , we are ready . 
  next week the european council will get together . 
  at every eu27 council i should give an account of the progress of the negotiations . 
  next week , it will be three months after the sending of the article 50 letter . 
  we have n't negotiated , we have n't progressed . 
  thus we must begin this negotiation . 
  we are ready as soon as the uk itself is ready . 
  it could be tomorrow morning as mr juncker said , it could be next week , it could be the 19th [ of june ] as i proposed . 
  today i will have a meeting with theresa may 's personal envoy , her sherpa olly robbins , to have a first discussion on the conditions and organisation of the negotiation . 
  we should start very quickly because time is passing and we have to work to the timeline fixed by the treaty . 
  it will take us several months to draw out the conditions of an orderly withdrawal , with difficult and sensitive points of discussion . 
  so let 's not waste time . 
  ** q : ** what did you make of the uk elections ? 
  are you concerned that negotiations could be made more difficult ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** i am concerned [ by the need ] to have a partner for the negotiation as quickly as possible . 
  that 's my preoccupation today . 
  i need a british delegation on the other side of the table , a head of the british delegation that is stable , accountable and that has a mandate . 
  we 're publishing our two documents on the rights of citizens and the financial settlement . 
  the uk will doubtless have their own propositions that i will examine when i have them . 
  we need explanations and precision on these subjects , during the negotiations . 
  and then secondly , the uk government should make explicit what it hopes for from the new partnership . 
  what i know now is [ taken from ] the white paper , and the letter from mrs may . 
  i 'm working with these two documents [ to understand ] the uk position . 
  ** q : ** is it worrying that you could be negotiating with a minority government dependent on [ northern ireland 's democratic unionist party ] , given the sensitivity of the irish question ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** the question of borders is one of the three big areas where the uk decision to quit the eu has created uncertainty -- lots of uncertainty . 
  in particular , the irish question is one i 'm very attentive to . 
  we must preserve the good friday agreement in all its dimensions , maintain the common travel area as it is , and respect the rules of the single market . 
  [ we must ] organise in one manner or another the control of people and goods which leave or enter the eu . 
  i think it 's possible . 
  ** q : ** are you now preparing for a soft brexit ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** i do n't know what hard brexit or soft brexit mean . 
  i read yesterday `` open brexit '' too . 
  brexit is the withdrawal from the eu -- it is the uk that decided that . 
  we 're implementing it . 
  i 'll say it clearly : there 's no spirit of revenge , no punishment , no naivety either , and truth . 
  truth on what brexit means , what leaving the eu signifies , by its consequences . 
  the citizens have the right to know this truth . 
  all options are available and on the table . 
  every one of these options and models has its own balance , in terms of rights and obligations . 
  the uk government knows the rules , the conditions for each one of its options . 
  we 're preparing for all options -- including that of a `` no deal '' , which has been mentioned by a certain number of british leaders . 
  as for constructive options , they are available , with rules that we will not compromise on . 
  we will not accept any cherry picking . 
  ** q : ** have uk citizens been sufficiently informed of the eu 's red lines ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** there 's always work to be done . 
  what i observed in the debate around the referendum -- very few people in charge explained what brexit meant , or what were the consequences of brexit . 
  it 's time now to explain [ them ] . 
  ** q : ** are you worried you might need to push back your timeline ? 
  three months have already passed . 
  ** michel barnier : ** my preoccupation is that time is passing -- it 's passing quicker than anyone believes -- because the subjects we need to deal with are extraordinarily complex from a technical , judicial and financial point of view . 
  that 's why we 're ready to start very quickly . 
  i ca n't negotiate with myself . 
  ** q : ** so today , you 're not thinking of the possibility of pushing back this date ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** if we work seriously , i see neither the usefulness nor the interest of pushing back this date . 
  why ? 
  because every extra delay is a source of instability which we do n't need , which the economy does n't need . 
  ** q : ** given this tight timetable , would you say there is no room for manoeuvring ? 
  if there 's any drama , you can not meet the timetable , right ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** there wo n't be any drama from my side . 
  the uk has decided to leave the eu . 
  i know the emotions , the political , passionate dimension , i 'm a politician . 
  but we must treat this question in a judicial , serious manner . 
  ** q : ** is there a danger is that if we do lose time , we wo n't have time to discuss that third stage of a future relationship in a way that the uk would hope ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** that 's what we call sequencing . 
  but this sequencing -- it 's non-negotiable for us -- was not created , wanted , in order to create problems . 
  it was wanted in order to resolve problems . 
  because once again , there is a sensitive dimension to the question of the rights of citizens . 
  and from the british side too . 
  there is such sensitivity around the question of the financial settlement that i would like to very quickly play down this question , and find concrete , pragmatic and just solutions . 
  we need trust to build the future relationship . 
  among the options which are available , the one that the uk has asked for or proposed is that of a `` free-trade agreement '' . 
  it 's lots of work -- that i 'd like to start as soon as possible . 
  this free-trade agreement is of a unique character with regards to commercial agreements in eu history .
