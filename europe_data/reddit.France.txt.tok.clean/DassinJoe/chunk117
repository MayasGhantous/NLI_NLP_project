  [ current ] commercial agreements were negotiated in a process of regulatory convergence . 
  in the case of the uk , it 's the opposite . 
  we are totally integrated , because we are in the single market , and we are going to diverge . 
  what becomes of this divergence ? 
  is it controlled , inspected , checked -- and by who ? 
  or does it become a tool of regulatory competition , with consequences on social , environmental , consumer rights ? 
  on the `` level playing field '' , of state aid , of competition , of tax ? 
  those are questions that i 'm asked . 
  ** q : ** the uk may soon make a `` generous '' offer to protect some citizens ' rights . 
  does the offer seem generous to you ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** i do n't really know what `'' generous '' means . 
  i want to preserve the rights of the british in the eu and the citizens of the 27 in the uk , and [ maintain ] the rights acquired by the citizens and their families up until the day of brexit in a lasting manner . 
  i do n't know if it 's generous to preserve the rights of people and their families who are worried . 
  i want to be fair in this situation . 
  ** q : ** when it comes to a compromise or a new relationship with the uk , will it be easy to keep the unity of the eu27 ? 
  ** michel barnier : ** unity does n't fall from the sky . 
  you must build it every day . 
  we 've built it together for six months , it was n't easy . 
  my mission will be to preserve it . 
  there 's nothing wrong with promoting a particular social arrangement in a positive way . 
  it 's when it 's promoted negatively or in an exclusive manner , by denigrating other social arrangements , that it becomes problematic . 
  i know plenty of christians who believe firmly in marriage and family and so on , but who do n't feel the need to push their views down other people 's throats . 
  it sounds like this world congress of families is n't just in the business of asserting the importance of heterosexual marriage and traditional families ( positive campaigning ) , it also insists on denying rights/privileges to other people ( negative campaigning ) . 
  are you saying ruaidr\u00ed ua conchobair was n't high king ? 
  sources please . 
  what the fuck is it to you ? 
  here 's a quick [ background from wikipedia  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_volunteer_force#background )  april 1966 , ulster loyalists led by ian paisley ( founder of the dup ) founded the ulster constitution defence committee ( ucdc ) . 
  it set up a paramilitary-style wing called the ulster protestant volunteers ( upv ) . 
  the ` paisleyites ' set out to stymie the civil rights movement and oust terence o'neill , prime minister of northern ireland . 
  although o'neill was a unionist , they saw him as being too ` soft ' on the civil rights movement and too friendly with the republic of ireland . 
  there was to be much overlap in membership between the ucdc/upv and the uvf . 
  vote for intellectual absurdity !, 
  vote buckethead !, 
  there was a high kingship in ireland prior to the norman invasion . 
  it unified the five provinces under one crown . 
  features in this movie [ blue is the warmest colour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_is_the_warmest_colour ) ( la vie d\u2019ad\u00e8le ) . 
  it 's a charming museum . 
  this was only up for a short while afaik , and it was before the election made theresa bend over for the dup . 
   if the author had made the kind of nuanced point that you just have then i would n't have had a problem fair enough . 
  unfortunately nuance is lacking in a lot of these discussions , and we end up with slogans and platitudes that take the place of reasoned argument . 
  i still hope that the negotiators on both sides will be sensible . 
   trading would return to wto rules . 
  trade would not stop no , but there would be massive bottlenecks . 
  no deal means that every product the u.k. ships to eu has to be recertified . 
  no deal means every lorry and container entering an eu port gets checked . 
  i think there might be 10k trucks per week currently , and there is almost zero infrastructure in place to deal with them because it 's not needed at present . 
  no deal means that a car might have customs duties applied four times on different components , because the supply chain stretches across four or five member states . 
  this notion of falling back on wto rules is dangerous . 
  every country that exports to the eu has agreements to govern product safety standards recognition and so on . 
  no deal means that uk products are n't grandfathered in based on past compliance . 
  no deal is a big mess . 
  most irish people do n't read him . 
  irish times readership is under 500k . 
  that said , o'toole is less divisive than other columnists ( kevin myers , for example ) , so i 'd expect that most of his readership think that he 's worth reading , viz . 
  thought-provoking or informative . 
  i certainly do n't agree with him all the time , but he 's generally worth a read . 
   with macron and merkel she 's speaking to her ~ ~ equals ~ ~ ( political ) betters may is very weak now , thanks to self-inflicted wounds . 
  she 'll have to work hard for people in the eu to take her seriously . 
  i did know . 
  i 'd read about it on wikipedia . 
  my point stands : a simple majority is enough . 
  i 'm surprised you think the two weeks are for the government to find new supporters , which let 's face it is unlikely , rather than to allow other parties try to form a coalition . 
   the guy brought about the biggest political change since the end of ww2 . 
  has n't happened yet . 
  the point of the two weeks is to allow another coalition to form . 
  it seems unlikely that two weeks after a vote of no confidence , the main coalition partner could somehow find enough support to form a new government . 
  a simple majority in a no-confidence vote is enough to trigger an early election . 
  plus may said she 'd drop the fixed term act in her 2017 manifesto . 
  and she is nothing if not consistent . 
  first guy is meant to be ian paisley , founder of the dup . 
  second guy is meant to be gerry adams , president of sinn f\u00e9in . 
  it 's more recent than that for me . 
  up to the mid-80s women in ireland wore headscarves routinely . 
  it was expected for women to cover their heads in catholic church . 
  the rule ( or recommendation ) on head covering was removed in the 1983 version of canon law . 
  the doctrines , practices , and ceremonies associated with the pope or the papal system . 
  i 'm not sure it still is ? 
  certainly used to be . 
  edit : never mind it is still the official name . 
  here 's a factoid : the term tory comes from an irish word * toraidhe * for `` bandit '' or `` outlaw '' ( literally * fugitive * ) . 
  it was used as a term of abuse for one political faction but they came to embrace it . 
  i would n't say `` no matter what '' , given what happened to the uup . 
  but your general point that the dup probably wont implode due to coalition is correct . 
  sf are n't communists . 
  dup are dodgy as fuck . 
  tories are gon na tory ... theresa may even used `` conservative and unionist party '' to refer to her party today . 
  first time i 've heard her use that name . 
  what 'll he be , early 70s ? 
  yeah maybe a bit long in the tooth for it . 
  sure they could invite blair back i suppose ... ^ ^ ^ jk, 
  that 's cool because theresa actually had to skip some debates and appearances during the campaign in order to study brexit preparation at home , so she 'll be delighted and ready to pull her sleeves up and get to work tomorrow morning at half past nine . 
  oh yes . 
  yeah the fucking marching ... and their poxy bowler hats . 
  initial lists of dup demands : * young earth creationism given equal status in the uk curriculum * ban on popery * extension of the renewable heating incentive for another 20 years * right to marry cousins * join the great orange leader in exiting the paris accords * no abortion , no contraception * rollback women 's rights, 
  aye , that 's a lot of it . 
  north antrim dairy farmers send a lot of milk into the republic for processing . 
  do n't forget the [ clontibret invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clontibret_invasion ), 
   well , it will be fun for the people in britain to find out how shitty the dup are yeah , i was just thinking that meself . 
  i 'd go for * smiddereeny *, 
  they believed the polls that gave them a huge lead and thought they could do anything they wanted .
