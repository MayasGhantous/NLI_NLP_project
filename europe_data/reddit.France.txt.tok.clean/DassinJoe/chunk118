  they also did n't expect corbyn to prove such a good campaigner . 
  yes quite likely . 
  i know . 
  we could do a lot more . 
  yes and they got some dodgy funding to campaign in britain ( i.e. 
  outside ni ) . 
  but a lot of their support is among the farming community , so i 'd expect the post-brexit arrangements to include generous agricultural subsidies . 
  what a mess ... 
  labour are better off sitting this one out . 
  the tories are up shit creek but still have to negotiate brexit . 
  the dup has them over a barrel . 
  the labour party should rally around corbyn ( who really delivered ) and prepare for government in 2022 . 
  smithereens likely developed from the irish word smidir\u00edn\u00ed , which means `` little bits . '', 
  that irish word is the diminutive of smiodar , meaning `` fragment . '', 
  in irish we add - een ( \u00edn ) as a suffix to represent a diminutive , often with personal names . 
  * theresa the timewaster * . 
  what a joke the tories have become, 
  so long then , paul nuttals of ukip . 
  `` i invented electricity , '' that was your catchphrase . 
  bet you 're shocked you lost . 
  yeah , even if the exit poll is as wrong as it has ever been in 25 years , they 'll still end up with one seat less . 
  amber rudd under threat in hastings allegedly !, 
  labour probably . 
   but their data gathering and micro targeting of voters and focus on the marginals has been excellent and that is more important than anything . 
  looking absolutely dreadful from the exit poll . 
  you guys might want a refund ? 
  no majority is better than a bad majority theresa ? 
  what a waste of time and money ... 
  nice one !, 
  i 'm waiting for an exit poll and then off to bed . 
  early start tomorrow . 
  enjoy the night !, 
  hopefully this election will be the end of the line for paul nuttall and he can get back to premier league football and academia . 
   british humans enjoy final day of having rights [ foxes too .

  how about this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6fzyrt/just_had_to_tell_a_polling_station_officer_to/ should the polling officer have had the newspaper on display ? 
   is there something wrong with it ? 
  maybe it 's fine for poland . 
  direct control of the state broadcaster is not common in western europe . 
   sweden goverment obviously has their own agenda where its illegal to talk about refugee problems citation needed . 
  the role of a politician is to persuade and to propose policy . 
  the role of a newspaper is - in theory - to inform its readership . 
  clearly these newspapers are going beyond that . 
   just stop your nonsense . 
  lol . 
  not [ irlande douze points ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3kxgo_gro ) ? 
   tvp is going through this every time a new goverment has won the election . 
  and that 's a good thing in your book ? 
   reporters without borders are completely shit and ca n't provide good rankings they 've published something you disagree , therefore they 're shit ? 
  that 's a strong line of argument . 
   freedom of speech and freedom of press are different things . 
  [ there are minor differences but they 're not significant ] ( http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-01/22-difference-between-speech-and-press.html ) . 
  so blocking someone on twitter is the equivalent of the state taking control of the tv and radio and firing the directors ? 
  if you do n't like being told what to do , why do you continue to buy these newspapers that very obviously tell you what to do ? 
   she is very anti-immigration . 
    she pretends to be yes , she consistently missed her own `` limits '' when home secretary . 
  did i say it matters ? 
  i simply said that the british people must like being told what to do , otherwise the newspapers would 've stopped this already . 
  newspapers are commercial ventures . 
  if their circulation plummets because people are pissed off with them , they 'll stop doing whatever it is that pissed people off . 
  they 've been weighing in on the british elections as long as i can remember ( at least since the early 80s ) , ergo it must be working for them . 
  it helps that you have an entire public broadcasting channel ( beeb iii ) that 's essentially dedicated to internet memes . 
  past performance is not indicative of future results . 
  the brits must appreciate being told what to do by their newspapers , otherwise why does this continue ? 
  is there an oblique reference to kathy griffin ? 
   at least the freedom of speech is well respected unlike in some other eu states . 
  huh ? 
  someone should tell reporters without borders i guess . 
  on the world press freedom index , poland fell from 18th in 2015 , to 47th in 2016 , to [ 54th in 2017 ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) . 
   moved in 2013 to algeria and later started a phd in france . 
  from the french press , he apparently tried to start up his own news website in algeria in 2011 but it only lasted two years . 
  he worked for another algerian news service for a couple more years , and then came to france to start his phd . 
  he recently moved to the paris region from metz because his phd supervisor got moved . 
   is being treated at hospital . 
  yeah , that 's what i read too . 
  shot in the legs i think . 
  in hospital . 
  lol . 
  [ yougov poll ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/general-election/poll-third-of-scots-more-likely-to-back-independence-if-may-pm-1-4468267 ) suggests 31 % of scots more likely to support independence if may is pm . 
  interestingly , it serves sturgeon 's greater interest for may to win . 
  france has agreements on the state level to honour us driving licenses : if you 're from one of the lucky states , you can swap your license , if not you have to resit the driving test . 
  this suggests that it could be possible for the eu to work directly with individual states . 
  the recent attacks in the uk would suggest `` yes '' . 
  i know lots of londoners who 'd gladly cut off the rest of england and stay in the eu . 
  rest in peace ignacio . 
  lol . 
  it 's not a question of an embargo . 
  it 's a question of reaching an agreement on how to treat uk goods as they enter the eu . 
  this is separate from tariffs . 
  no deal means no agreement on this subject . 
  no i did n't miss the point , i 'm trying to explain to you that `` we 'll simply default to wto tariffs '' is n't a reasonable outcome for trade . 
  even if the end result is wto terms , the uk will need to negotiate a deal on how goods enter and are recognized inside the eu , otherwise there will be absolute chaos . 
   there 's no reason from either side to change things . 
  unless there 's some irreconcilable difference over , say , the exit bill . 
  may can claim that she 's a difficult woman , but the eu has a whole lot of ways to make life difficult for her if it decides to be bloody minded . 
   very little has to change . 
  no , as soon as the uk pulls out of the eu , everything trade-related is subject to change . 
  here 's one example concerning trade : within the eu , countries follow a standard customs code . 
  goods produced inside the eu are `` union goods '' and are treated the same way throughout the eu , regardless of origin . 
  goods produced outside the eu are non-union goods and are treated differently .
