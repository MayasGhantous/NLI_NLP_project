  in order to facilitate passage of goods into the eu from outside , countries have entered into agreements with the eu on how to recognize compliance with various standards . 
  for example , something certified safe in canada is considered certified safe in the eu because the regulatory bodies have similar safety criteria . 
  if the uk walks away with no deal , this mutual recognition of standards will cease . 
  every product coming into the eu from the uk will have to be recertified . 
  then of course , so much uk cargo traffic goes through calais , but calais has very limited capacity to check non-eu cargo ( because it has n't had to for donkey 's years ) .

  okay , so `` walk away with nothing '' does n't mean `` nothing '' it means status quo in many areas but possibly falling back on wto rates if there 's no trade deal ... you do understand that to achieve status quo in many areas will require negotiations and compromise , even before they start looking at tariffs ? 
   if you 're not prepared to leave with nothing what does * nothing * mean ? 
  no rights for uk citizens in the eu ? 
  no open skies agreement ? 
  no shared air traffic control ? 
  it 's not simply `` we 'll default to wto rates '' , it 's `` we 'll revisit every single international agreement with the eu or made while the uk was part of the eu '' . 
  saying `` we 'll leave with nothing '' is just barmy and it 's simply not how negotiations work between countries . 
   but corbyn would have to say yes if the eu refused to negotiate further beyond that . 
  which they could do knowing he would n't walk away . 
  he would n't say yes to that because it 's not a deal at all . 
  it 's simply the eu dictating conditions . 
  this view of `` all or nothing '' negotiation in trade deals is facile ; the real world does n't work that way . 
  it 's hilarious how corbyn is held to a higher standard than the current prime minister . 
  he provides a costed manifesto , while the tories have published a bunch of ideas with a `` we 'll get back to you on the pricing '' , and yet he 's the one who attracts criticism . 
  similarly , may has said `` no deal is better than a bad deal '' but she has n't defined a `` bad deal '' . 
  his daughter was on tv yesterday saying that she kept calling around the hospitals in hope that he was somewhere ... 
  very sad . 
  you realize you 're the one who is implying that millwall fans are racists , right ? 
  the difference is that [ thatcherism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thatcherism ) is a discernible political ideology , although it 's subject to some discussion as to its exact contents .

  it 's like the apprentice or big brother or something like that , except that every week one of the jihadis gets voted by the public to blow himself or herself up .

   the uk and us , who lost hundreds of thousands of men crossing the arctic hundreds of thousands ? 
  seems unlikely - only 7 % of cargo was lost on that route . 
   several billion every year just a monitor a few thousand suspected radicals really that much ?

  [ the indiana pi bill is the popular name for bill # 246 of the 1897 sitting of the indiana general assembly , one of the most notorious attempts to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat . 
  despite its name , the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle , rather than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant \u03c0 , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter . 
  the bill , written by amateur mathematician edward j. goodwin , does imply various incorrect values of \u03c0 , such as 3.2 .

  glad you 're safe . 
  these attacks are against us all . 
  oh fuck i 'm so sorry . 
  be safe !, 
  dude , you 've replied the same thing three times . 
  phone issue ? 
  i generally do n't downvote contrary opinions , at least reasonable ones . 
  i save it for the alt right fuckers who show up here from time to time . 
  or he implemented the policy of the party because one principle can override another . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of his positions , but i can at least respect his performance as a politician . 
  what was labour party policy ? 
  i certainly would n't complain several times in one thread about downvotes . 
  three weeks ago i would 've agreed . 
  now i 'm not so sure . 
  prior to the election i was giving may the benefit of the doubt . 
  she has proven a serious liability . 
  similarly , i found corbyn quite poor before the campaign , but i 've developed a somewhat grudging admiration for him . 
  he 's probably the most principled uk political leader in a generation . 
  no , he 's been in politics for a long time , so i think he knows what he 's getting into . 
  i do n't expect he 'll win this time . 
  corbyn is proving an excellent campaigner . 
  may is simply dreadful on the campaign trail . 
   the tories will win a landslide . 
  6 days, 
  shocking that this would remain unavailable to the lib dems if it was initiated as part of a deal with them . 
  noticed that breton was missing so i looked it up : * aval * - so close enough to the welsh . 
  also in cornish : * aval * . 
  i know right ? 
  there 's a general election coming up !, 
  but no campaigning for theresa - head buried in the old brexit books for the next 10 days ... 
  it 'd be awesome if may would do an ama on reddit .

  the institute is there for over a century but it became part of the university of london in 1969 . 
  :-) how many times did you revise that comment ? 
  that 'd be * reductio * i think . 
   your brief departure from logical fallacy you 're consistently insulting even though i 've given you several chances to get back on track . 
  reported . 
   you 're deliberately departing from my line of reasoning ( prominence in the debate should depend on votes ) no , you claim that ** prominence in the debate should depend on polling data ** . 
  that 's what you 've written here :   as if they are equal to the conservatives ( 46 % of voters ) when did the conservatives = 46 % of voters i wonder ? 
  oh yeah , in another comment by / u/chrisawhitmore :   the conservatives ( polling an average of ~ 46 % ) polls do not equal votes . 
   discredit my reasoning your reasoning discredits itself by being contrary to the principles of a multi-party democratic system . 
   i would however be obliged if you could give me the contact information for any of the teachers at your primary school so i can pass on some tips on how to teach basic logic and debating skills . 
  the personal attacks are tiresome . 
  side note : / u/chrisawhitmore has brought the discussion from amicable to confrontational . 
   i mean , you clearly know you 're being a facetious prick for no good reason lay off the personal attacks . 
  i 'm following your reasoning to various potential conclusions . 
  your line of argument appears to be as follows : the tory party is polling 46 % , therefore the tory party representative deserves 46 % of the air time during a ** debate between party leaders ** . 
  this is wrong for several reasons . 
  you 've based your view on * polling * , which is frankly indefensible . 
  political debates are about communication and the exposition of ideas . 
  in a democracy , we give every party the right to express their position .
