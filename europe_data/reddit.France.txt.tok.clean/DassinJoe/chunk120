  this was a debate among party leaders ; to treat parties fairly , they should have equal time . 
  otherwise the implication is that the message from one party is more important than the message from another party . 
  the inclusion/exclusion of certain parties is up to the broadcaster to decide , but once a party is included it should be given the same treatment as any other . 
  i guess over time your system could extend to voting behaviour , so people who vote corbyn in the coming election will get only 0.75 of a vote in the next ge , and people who vote farron will get 0.25 of a vote . 
  registration wall . 
  can you post the article op ? 
  * immigrant song * as the soundtrack !, 
   for a fair representation , amber rudd should have had an hour to speak for every 15 seconds wood got . 
  to be properly fair , the ruling party should control all media , amirite ? 
  some great entertainment yesterday . 
  [ tim farron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacmlp3cz9e ) : * amber rudd is up next . 
  she is not the prime minister . 
  the prime minister is n't here . 
  she ca n't be bothered . 
  so why should you ? 
  in fact bake off is on bbc2 next . 
  why not make a brew . 
  you 're not worth theresa may 's time . 
  do n't give her yours . 
  * [ theresa may ] ( https://streamable.com/5h70v ) : * i 'm interested in the fact that jeremy corbyn seems to be paying far more attention to how many appearances on telly he 's doing . 
  i think he ought to be paying a little more attention to thinking about brexit negotiations . 
  that 's what i 'm doing , to make sure we get the best possible deal for britain . 
  * -- yeah , because it was corbyn who called the general election while may really just wanted to concentrate on brexit ... 
  there 's some monolithic left and some monolithic right ? 
  and one loves refugees and the other hates refugees . 
  huh , til . 
  where does this particular straw man come from ? 
   you are just commenting on his populist ability if you look up a little , i wrote :   we 've learned that may is a poor campaigner , whereas corbyn is quite good at it . 
  yes of course i 'm commenting on his ability as a campaigner , because that 's what 's going on at present . 
  will he be good at governing a country ? 
  it 's hard to say , but i 'd be reluctant to say unequivocally that may is better . 
  she 's been lacklustre at best as pm . 
  corbyn seems to genuinely like connecting with people . 
  he 's speaking well and coming across as a decent guy . 
  i had very little time for him before this election , but i have to admire his ability on the campaign trail . 
   wow . 
  millennials really are fucked in the head are n't they . 
  not in a position to answer that as i 'm likely older than you and i 've more kids . 
  how are you being smug ? 
  no it 's not by planning for your daughter - that 's laudable . 
  your smugness oozes out of your implication that everyone who ca n't afford university for their child is an irresponsible parent who does n't give a shit about their kids . 
  but like i said . 
  does n't matter to me . 
  edit : i see you 've already edited your post . 
   i 'm not lumping myself in with people like this ^ lol . 
  you 've got a comprehension problem . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af does n't matter to me , but you might want to ease off on the smug juice . 
  that was a masterstroke by corbyn to agree to appear in the debate tonight . 
  i think you might be confusing talibs ( members of the taliban ) with the mujahideen more generally . 
  the talibs are literally students of a branch of islamic fundamentalism ( talib means `` student '' or `` seeker of knowledge '' ) . 
  the taliban were one of the factions fighting with the mujahideen , and they grew to be the dominant one . 
  other mujahideen factions were very different and did n't have a strong religious element . 
  some of them would have been pro-western influence even . 
  off its meds ? 
   why would i vote for labour ? 
  a few ideas ( and i 'm not a corbyn fan , btw ) : because you want a living wage ? 
  because you want your kids to go to college without incurring massive debts ? 
  because you do n't want an internet that 's controlled by the government ? 
  we 've learned that may is a poor campaigner , whereas corbyn is quite good at it . 
  i 'll be surprised if the tories do n't get a majority , but i 'm now doubting they 'll get the huge win that everyone expected a few weeks ago . 
  maybe he could fly over and hold some rallies to advise the british people to vote for her ? 
  assad 's got some sick beats tho . 
  i like the tune but the lyrics feel forced . 
  does n't change what they are . 
  do you remember when they were in charge ? 
  afghanistan was a religious nuthouse - music outlawed , girls ca n't go to school , that sort of shite . 
   they are just afghan goat herders or farmers taking pot shots at nato troops nah , they 're religious freaks mostly trained in pakistan . 
  yeah i know , but the thread is about twinning towns . 
  found you a town called div\u00edn in slovakia . 
  get the town twinning committee organised . 
   which life would you prefer ? 
  i did n't realize i had to choose ? 
   entire argument for whale hunt being more cruel i did n't make any argument about cruelty ? 
  remember folks , [ wear sunscreen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stj7azbijoi ) . 
  objectively , probably not , but it 's important to some people . 
  okay , til . 
  there are important differences . 
  cows are slaughtered with close to zero trauma . 
  ** `` surprise !, 
  '' ** * bolt to the head or electric shock * game hunting can be different , but in general hunters seek to minimise the distress caused to the animal , not least because excessive chase can impact the taste of the meat . 
  the hunters i know , both bow and gun , do n't announce their presence to the animal until they 're ready to kill it . 
  whales in the faroe islands are driven ashore by a group of engined boats , then killed on the beach . 
  if they do n't beach themselves they 're dragged ashore with hooks . 
  without even getting into the question of animal suffereing , it 's obvious that it is different from game hunting or slaughtering cows . 
  i do n't think she 's made the uk a laughing stock , but i think she should have focused on starting negotiations sooner rather than calling an election . 
  [ positions within the eu are hardening ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/30/painstaking-detail-brexit-process-revealed-eu-documents ) , and not in a particularly positive way towards the uk . 
  may stated last night that she 'll walk away without a deal because ( yet another soundbite ) * no deal is better than a bad deal * , but she 's never articulated what constitutes a bad deal . 
  for example , if ecj involvement in citizenship/residency issues is unacceptable ( arguably it breaks a principle of brexyref ) , then it 's no deal and everyone 's the poorer . 
   the motive for the ** secret ** operation is the operation over ? 
  yeah , they may also be setting groundwork for future trade - if the eu has lower standards , the uk can export less efficient products ~ ~ ( think dyson vacuum cleaners ) ~ ~ to the eu without fear of running foul of enviro regs . 
  courtesy of google translate ;-), 
   * when i get all steamed up *  * i just shout *  * alle der degeneriert m\u00fcssen get\u00f6tet werden !, 
   i thought her entire modus operandi during her time as home secretary was `` immigration = bad '' , and `` immigration to the 10s of thousands '' . 
  that was what she said , certainly , but on no occasion did she meet her own targets for non-eu immigration . 
  there are two plausible explanations for this : 1 . 
  she 's incompetent . 
  she did n't really want to limit non-eu immigration as much as she claimed . 
  i do n't understand why paxman did n't challenge her on her past immigration performance last night . 
  he brought up the subject , but then he allowed her to waffle her way onto the future . 
  torpedo or undermine , whatever .
