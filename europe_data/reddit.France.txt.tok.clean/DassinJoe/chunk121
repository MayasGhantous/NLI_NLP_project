  if you record outside your own property in the uk , you 're subject to the data protection act : https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/cctv it seems to me that you 're discouraged to film beyond your property boundary , and if you do so you have to put up a sign to let people know . 
  normally there are restrictions on where your cctv can film . 
  i can point a camera at my front yard , for example , but not at the area past my gate ( a public pavement/road ) . 
  i was just thinking that trump would be on that office like white on rice . 
   for a while , i thought that maybe he 's aiming for a nixon-style madman theory . 
  i wondered about that too , but he 's too erratic even for that explanation . 
   did you know that the giant roaches can fly ? 
  had a trip to africa some years back and our room got occupied by flying roaches the size of sparrows ( chickadees in the us i think ) . 
  the good thing was that they were so big and so cumbersome in flight that you could bat them out of the air with tennis racket .

  then the cultural component should be dealt with in the legal framework around citizenship . 
  in fact it 's already present in some jurisdictions . 
   fuck off , there is literally nothing i could say that would n't just coke with more situpulatioms from you lol . 
  give me twenty sit-ups . 
  of course the law can be flawed . 
  but you 're arguing that there 's no way to cleanly define citizenship . 
  i 'm saying that many countries have done this - using different definitions - and this is the context in which we operate . 
  of course laws can change over time - look at what happened in ireland about 15 years ago for an example . 
  there may be no perfect definition , but countries need to establish an imperfect one simply to operate . 
  this can be revisited if circumstances change . 
  there 's a difference between `` this subject is too complex '' and `` here is the current legal definition '' . 
  you 're arguing for paralysis because a definition can not be perfect . 
  they 're not immutable , but they 're better than shrugging your shoulders and saying `` nobody can define this thing '' . 
  governments always give a clear definition when defining citizenship criteria . 
  a capital post !, 
  there was a secret cinema found some years back . 
   or perhaps david davis and theresa may might make a mess of the a50 negotiations would n't be too surprising . 
  davis gives the impression that he 'd make a mess of ordering breakfast if left to his own devices , and may is inspiring less and less confidence on the campaign trail .

  you consider yourself part of a tradition in toryism that has opposed muslim immigration . 
  i 'm unaware of this tradition , so i 'm interested to know who your antecedents are . 
  powell was persona non grata in the tory party iirc . 
  that took some time , did n't it ? 
  so powell is one * , who else ? 
  * seems like i gave you powell for free , tbh . 
  funny , i 'm the only one of us two who has directly answered a question . 
  who objected to muslims settling in the uk in the 18th century ? 
  in the 19th century ? 
  in the 20th century ? 
  give me names if they are your ideological forefathers . 
  do you claim enoch powell as one of your group ? 
  please stop dodging the question . 
  tell me who they were and i might . 
  also answer some of my questions . 
  in what way are ** you ** the same people who objected ? 
   to be fair , we 're the same people who did n't want to let the , in in the first place . 
  how are you the same people ? 
  are you in your 80s ? 
  your 70s ? 
  when do you think muslims started immigrating to the uk ? 
  are you even old enough to have opposed the manchester bomber 's father being allowed into the uk in the 1980s ?

  there might be ^ ^ ^ ^ americans visiting the thread . 
  after a long and busy career as a chocolatier . 
   my point is what did people expect ? 
  people changing centuries of traditions just because they moved to uk or france . 
  i think it depends on the tradition . 
  muslims are expected to abide by laws concerning laicite in france , but they 're free to practice their faith . 
  fgm is outlawed in western societies , and although it continues as a practice those responsible face punishment . 
  muslims moving to 1950s france would have found a lot that was familiar : a male-dominated society with fairly strict public moral codes , woman 's place is in the home , etc. 
  french society has moved on , and the children of many of the muslims who came in the 50s and 60s have also moved on . 
  they 've adapted to a changing cultural climate . 
  nevertheless , we see mostly young people ( 20s-30s ) who are attracted by a violent fundamentalist form of islam . 
  these people are disaffected , do n't like modernity , and have an overdeveloped sense of victimhood . 
  they act out , as edgy young people have been acting out for generations . 
  she 's a disaster . 
  the least talented of the current group of uk party leaders , with the exception perhaps of paul nuttall . 
  easy to understand why she refused a televised leaders ' debate . 
   do n't we know who wrote or voted what law that created the problem , do we even care ? 
  there 's no single `` law that created the problem '' , but in the uk and france the most active encouragement of immigration was in the 1950s and 1960s . 
  this was when labour shortages led those governments to encourage immigration from former colonies . 
  since the early 70s , immigration has been less actively encouraged , but there 's been a steady flow of immigrants due to family connections . 
  such a wonderful city . 
   following ww2 , the uk was positive to the us , but the new superpower finds the british empire to be an obstacle - cue in the suez crisis and american support for non-european nationalism .
