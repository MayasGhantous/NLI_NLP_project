  the age profile in the us is interesting - older people think english is essential , but younger people are less certain . 
  i 'd guess as well that california , texas , new mexico , florida , and arizona would have more people saying that english is n't essential . 
  it 's important to defend traditional polish misogyny , bigotry , sectarianism , and excessive religiosity against the threat posed by muslim immigrants . 
  little was known about al qaeda in the 90s . 
  if he was fighting gaddafi , the british administration would have looked on him favourably at the time . 
   or the highest one '' habsburg '' . 
  not targaryen ? 
  unbelievable that this stuff is allowed happen in a workplace . 
   who would have anything to gain from leaking this information ? 
  it 's either money or expectation of a quid pro quo , but obviously there 's benefit to passing on secret information . 
   i do n't like that run/hide surrender/collaborate stuff anymore it 's largely a neo-con meme that was popularized because france did n't sign up to iraq war 2 . 
  as the brits launched themselves into that fiasco , they embraced the meme . 
  no it 's not . 
   twerking and other degenerate shit lol . 
   the very same people you have evidence that afghanis who killed germans were subsequently welcomed into germany ? 
  irish living and working in france . 
  have also lived and worked in uk and spent long stints working in germany , belgium , and finland . 
  edit : i remap an azerty keyboard to us and then i 'm okay so long as i never ever look down . 
  maybe a reference to the two potential successors to enda kenny , who is stepping down as pm and leader of his party ? 
  he 's been in the irish parliament for 42 years . 
   fianna f\u00e1il : you have two cows . 
  you kill them . 
  you get two more cows and promise this time it will be better . 
  you kill them , again .

  https://twitter.com/mrkenshabby/status/867036448037511169  marc haynes was just 7 years old and a major fan of the 007 series when he spotted his hero at the nice airport . 
  haynes alerted his grandfather , who was sitting with him by the departure gate . 
   `` i told my granddad i 'd just seen james bond and asked if we could go over so i could get his autograph . '', 
   `` as charming as you 'd expect , roger asks my name and duly signs the back of my plane ticket , a fulsome note full of best wishes . 
   `` i 'm ecstatic , but as we head back to our seats , i glance down at the signature . 
  it 's hard to decipher but it definitely does n't say ` james bond ' . 
   `` my grandad looks at it , half figures out it says ` roger moore ' - i have absolutely no idea who that is , and my heart sinks . 
   `` i tell my granddad he 's signed it wrong , that he 's put someone else 's name - so my grandad heads back to roger moore , holding the ticket which he 's only just signed . '', 
   marc heard his granddad tell moore : `` he says you 've signed the wrong name . 
  he says your name is james bond '' and describes the moment the star 's face `` crinkled up with realisation '' before he beckoned the young boy over to him . 
   marc explained : `` when i was by his knee , he leant over , looked from side to side , raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said to me , ' i have to sign my name as ` roger moore ' because otherwise ... blofeld might find out i was here . ', 
   `` he asked me not to tell anyone that i 'd just seen james bond and he thanked me for keeping his secret . 
  i went back to our seats , my nerves absolutely jangling with delight . 
   `` my grandad asked me if he 'd signed ` james bond ' . 
  no , i said . 
  i 'd got it wrong . 
  i was working with james bond now . 
   years later , haynes met moore again during a film project and told him of their earlier chance encounter :  `` i was working as a scriptwriter on a recording that involved unicef and roger moore was doing a piece to camera as an ambassador . 
   `` he was completely lovely and while the cameramen were setting up , i told him in passing the story of when i met him in nice airport . 
   `` he was happy to hear it , and he had a chuckle and said , ` well , i do n't remember but i 'm glad you got to meet james bond . ', 
  so that was lovely . 
   `` and then he did something so brilliant . 
  after the filming , he walked past me in the corridor , heading out to his car - but as he got level , he paused , looked both ways , raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said , ` of course i remember our meeting in nice . 
  but i did n't say anything in there , because those cameramen - any one of them could be working for blofeld . '', 
   `` i was as delighted at 30 as i had been at 7 . 
  what a man . 
  what a tremendous man . '', 
  rip roger, 
  that sounds like [ shingles ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/clinical-overview.html ) and it 's something that can affect people who have had chicken pox when young ( my mother , for example ) or who have been vaccinated ( your acquaintance ) . 
  the reason it did n't spread is that shingles is not highly contagious . 
  it 's potentially fatal in a very small percentage of cases . 
  likely that it 's included in a combination vaccine . 
  wtf is he on about ? 
  only since 2015 i think . 
  i think that 's been [ revisited again . 
  ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brontosaurus-is-back1/ ), 
   she thinks she lost due to the fact that people were afraid of leaving the eu / returning to to the franc she 's also getting a lot of internal pressure within the fn . 
  yeah , the reuters headline appears to have been revised . 
  there was a plan to launch a terror attack at arndale [ eight years ago ] ( http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-arndale-centre-terror-attack-11989957 ) . 
  * ( greater ) helsinki is a conurbation of helsinki , vantaa , espoo , and kauniainen * everyone in finland has a small island with a cabin . 
  they all go there at the weekend . 
  * beetroot . 
  * before becoming a mobile phone behemoth , nokia used to make a huge range of goods : paper , rubber boots , televisions , computers , gas masks , ... * finnish men are generally sound if taciturn ; finnish women are generally charming . 
  like / u/skyr3xx says , it 's just speculation at the moment . 
  however , i read a report about an adult man being thrown 30ft ( 10m ) by the blast . 
  he was one set of doors away from the explosion ( waiting for his wife and kids ) and was thrown to another set of doors . 
  add to this the assumption the bomb was portable and difficult to detect , plus it had some amount of shrapnel packed onto it . 
  this suggests a lot of explosive power in a small space . 
  that 's not easy to make . 
  you 've posted the same comment four times . 
   i do n't think we 'd have this problem if we were capable of forcing them to integrate really ? 
  i reckon you 'd have more problems if you force people to do things . 
  that 's brilliant !, 
   i heard one of these bombs is relatively easy to make . 
  from the witness reports of the power of the blast , i do n't think it was very easy to make this bomb . 
  my thoughts are with the families of the victims . 
  `` bloody apatosauruses , coming over here with their herbivore ways . 
  getting us confused with brontosauruses and occupying an important niche in the ecosystem . '', 
  very few people have heard of asselineau outside france , so while your comment is true , it may not be interesting for this subreddit . 
  many people have heard of mlp , hence my comparison with t may . 
  trusting the british govt does n't necessarily imply euroskeptic . 
  you 're extrapolating on very shaky ground . 
  move to britain . 
  job done . 
   those 43 % are probably eurosceptic to a degree . 
  um , did you miss the bit where it said 72 % trust the eu 's negotiating team ? 
  politicians can generally be relied on to make complete idiots of themselves when formulating policy on the internet . 
  first past the post . 
  that outcome is possible but not guaranteed . 
  my point ? 
  that the tories have a policy that 's similar to one of mlp . 
  thought that was blindingly obvious . 
  finally a theresa may u-turn that i can get behind !, 
  i 'm too brexy for my shirt . 
  too brexy for my shirt .
