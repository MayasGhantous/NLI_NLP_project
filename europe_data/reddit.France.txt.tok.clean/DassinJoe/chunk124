   the labour party are still waiting for that generation of labour voting pensioners . 
  but they never arrive . 
  it 's hard to beat the siren 's call of the triple lock . 
  http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/qui-sommes-nous/festival-de-cannes-1  ** what is the mission of the festival de cannes ? 
  **  in order to achieve this level of longevity , the festival de cannes has remained faithful to its founding purpose : to draw attention to and raise the profile of films , with the aim of contributing towards the development of cinema , boosting the film industry worldwide and celebrating cinema at an international level . 
  and to this day , this profession of faith constitutes the first article of the festival regulations . 
  cannes is n't just about film ; it 's also about cinema . 
   the deal is further evidence that the uk 's technology sector can now compete with the best . 
  i do n't think that was ever in doubt ? 
  meanwhile , the tory party wants to legalise fox hunting ... ... ... ... hey wait a minute !, 
  what if the toreadors went up against the british toffs !, 
  the bulls and foxes could watch from the stands . 
   tho with the shelf life of mushrooms , dunno if it 's feasible to export them ... 
  i 'm not sure it 'd be worth flying them to the continent , but a boat might be worthwhile . 
  the french eat loads of shrooms . 
   macron names half of parliamentary candidates from civil society rest of them are bloody rude though ... ^ ^ ^ ^ / jk, 
  there are 3.5 million what there now ? 
  poles ? 
  ac-10 citizens ? 
  you 're exiting the eu for a variety of reasons , and the terms of your exit are being decided by your government . 
  i 've updated the table . 
  it 'll take 166 trimesters , or 41.5 years . 
   67 is misleading . 
  on the contrary , what i wrote is not misleading at all . 
  `` many ** will ** work to 67 or even longer '' were my exact words . 
  the current average is rising and will continue to rise as the cohorts who can retire on a full pension before 67 move out of the system . 
  this is how it will progress through the system : year of birth | age for full pension entitlement | number of quarters for a full pension ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- 1952 | 65 years 9 months | 164 1953 | 66 years 2 months | 165 1954 | 66 years 7 months | 165 from 1955 | 67 years | 166 of course there will be people who retire earlier for various reasons , but the average age will gradually rise ( as you can see in the page you linked ) . 
  edit : update the table with the required trimesters, 
   he 's an artist who 's best known for not being with his face in public . 
  it 's not just that though . 
  it 's also banksy 's humour , which a lot of people appreciate , and the speed with which the work appears . 
  there 's a `` surprise '' element to banksy 's murals that makes them into an event . 
  you 'll be knocked out - do n't worry about it ;-), 
  well , a no-frills ryanair version of that . 
  the modeling is really quite limited and restricted to the uk and germany . 
  here 's the full report : http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/reports/homeoffice25_03.pdf, 
  i 'd knock them out when they arrive at the airport , place them in containers and just load the plane like a cargo jet . 
  resuscitate on arrival . 
  the planes could be much less bulky for an equivalent number of passengers if we just stack body pods in a pressurized hold . 
  could even avoid the pressurized hold if it 's cheaper to add an air flow to the pods . 
  * it 's been a while now , what can we do to make air travel even more unpleasant ? 
  '' * * `` add an extra queuing requirement ? 
  '' * * `` no , we did that a couple of years back . 
  how about something that affects passengers in the air ? 
  '' * * `` make them take their shoes off ? 
  but the ground staff have already claimed that one for their entertainment . 
  '' * * `` what about banning books and magazines ? 
  '' * * `` hmmm , interesting ... 
  but how will we sell our tatty products in the cabin ? 
  how about banning laptops instead ? 
  that way they ca n't work or do anything productive . 
  they 'll have to watch the shitty little screens of the onboard entertainment system . 
  from a labour transfer point of view , spain has been bailing out germany for some years now . 
  the report states :  `` one in three immigrants who had intended to migrate to work in germany would instead migrate to the uk '' taking this along with table 6.4 , baseline 02 , there are 73k predicted net migrants to germany , implying an additional 24k net for the uk . 
  that gives 24k + 13k = 37k net from the ac-10 over the period . 
  this figure turned out to be wildly wrong for several of the post accession years , but predicting an increase in net migration by 200 % is not the same as stating `` controls by other states would n't make much difference '' . 
  did you read the caveats at the end of the report ? 
   a major shortcoming of the uk analysis is the lack of good data . 
  the fact that no administrative figures on net migration to the uk are available means that survey data has to be used , which introduces a large potential error in the analysis . 
  indeed , the quality of [ uk migration stats is dreadful ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/long-term-international-migration/quality-of-long-term-international-migration-estimates-from-2001-to-2011/sty-quality-of-ltim.html ) . 
   ...  to sum up , even though the results do not seem implausible in the light of past studies , they should be evaluated with caution , and with due consideration of the limitations of the poor available data . 
  it should be noted that the main problem , which is the absence of sufficient information about historical migrations from ac-10 countries to the uk ( or to germany for that matter ) , can not be cured , even with a more complex econometric approach . 
   france 's official retirement age of 62 will be unchanged . 
  that 's the bare minimum retirement . 
  many people will work to 67 or even longer . 
   ms le pen had campaigned for france to leave the euro there was an [ interesting article ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-election-le-pen-idukkbn1841rl?il=0 ) about this posted recently . 
  some in the fn are blaming the stance on the euro as partially to blame for the fn 's failure in the second round . 
  there 's likely to be some fn internal struggle over this issue in coming months as they prepare for the legislative elections . 
  she 's also a christian and stables are important to christians because that 's where their god was born . 
  her strong and stable belief in the stable-born strong god should give her the stability and strength to carry on . 
   it stated controls by other states would n't make much difference . 
  did you read the report ? 
  according to this : [ the report had briefly considered what might happen if germany did introduce transitional controls . 
  about `` one in three immigrants who had intended to migrate to work in germany would instead migrate to the uk '' , it estimated .

  i like strasbourg but i 'd support this idea in the interest of efficiency . 
   criticise judgments . 
  obviously this was a lot more than criticizing judgments . 
  to quote myself `` the justices were very poorly treated '' . 
   not really . 
  yeah , really . 
  tim farron is repeatedly abused for disagreeing with brexit . 
  the supreme court agreed with him , however , and the justices concerned were very poorly treated by certain parts of the british media . 
  it has become all too common in britain to see abuse directed towards anyone who opposes the ( changing ) line ( s ) taken by the government on brexit . 
   his arguments and not those that are worthy of an academic . 
  like when he argued in january that the uk parliament had to be consulted before triggering article 50 ? 
  well strewthski !, 
  interesting puzzle , thanks !, 
  i would add some user feedback - something visual that pops up when a country is placed in the correct location . 
  maybe just float the name above it for a few seconds . 
  also , for me at least , cyprus was a little confusing . 
  it did n't have separate colours for the two separate parts . 
  this is an interesting article . 
  well yeah . 
  if this is n't going to happen for 50 years , brexit might be happening too soon . 
  if it 's going to be next tuesday , brexit is n't happening fast enough . 
  still about 250,000 turning out for boxing day hunts .
