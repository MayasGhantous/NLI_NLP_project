  it has n't really gone away . 
  well , ceta is n't in force yet , but i agree it might be part of the model for a future agreement . 
  however , it 's [ missing any equivalent of passporting ] ( http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/what-could-the-eu-canada-free-trade-deal-tell-us-about-brexit/ ) and it 's nowhere near as complete as membership of the single market . 
   soon got a timeframe for your doomsday scenario ? 
  or is it simply `` soon '' ? 
  there 's more than that going on . 
  he must be pilloried because he 's a heretic . 
  i agree both are stupid , though i think the `` literally stalin + mao !!! '', 
  one is worse . 
  yeah . 
  grayling is a widely respected ethicist and epistemologist , but he dares to question the dominant brexit narrative so he must therefore be ridiculed . 
  it 's a shame to watch a society turn in on itself like this , attacking anyone who challenges the received wisdom . 
   what a woman . 
  i wish she was my wife . 
  you wish you were married to a woman you 've never met ? 
  whom you 've only seen on the telly or the internet ? 
  yeah that 's not creepy at all . 
  the alt-right shut-ins will be sad to see her go ; she was fairly guaranteed to elicit a lot of fawning cringey adulation whenever she appeared . 
  she says she 's going to spend more time with her daughter ; fair play to her for that . 
  they 're only young for a brief time .

  ! remindme 2 years `` am i still on reddit ? 
  and if so , wtf is going on ? '', 
   the number who want brexit stopped or radically softened is only 25 per cent . 
  by my reading `` radically softened '' is n't even offered as an option in the poll . 
  the 25 % want brexit stopped , and the other option is simply brexit ( leave eu ) . 
  the uk government needs to start thinking about the 40 % who believe they can have both control of immigration and free trade with the eu . 
   far left progressivism is main stray of academia in humanities today unfortunately . 
  would you get out of here with your `` far left progressivism '' . 
  he 's published many books and articles stating his positions : he 's a secular humanist , centre leftist who happens to disagree with brexit . 
  comparing him with stalin is just dumb . 
   and to me it 's becoming less and less clear on why . 
  he 's a one-trick pony and his * raison d'etre * is gone now that brexit is underway . 
  it 's a bit sad to watch , but he 's been flailing recently in an attempt to draw attention to himself and find a cause . 
  he even got photographed with mlp having previously refused any association with the fn . 
   ca n't stand this old fart . 
  tries to come across as an intellectual , but no academic would ever ... you might not like him or agree with him , but he 's demonstrably [ an intellectual ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/a.-c.-grayling/e/b001iobkew/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1494340308&amp;sr=1-2-ent ) and [ an academic ] ( https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/nch-board/ ) . 
  hmm , let 's take a closer look : * regular poster on r/t _ d \u2714 * north american ( canadian ) obsessed with migrants to europe \u2714 * lots of spelling/grammar mistakes \u2714 * uses the term `` virtue signalling '' unironically \u2714 * uncertain feelings about democracy \u2714 * wants to `` punish '' people with different opinions \u2714 lol . 
  yeah i do n't think it 'll happen in 2 years , but i think that 's what the eventual deal will be . 
   the the ones who said yes should be forced yeah , let 's get rid of secret ballots !, 
  anyone who disagrees with you should be forced to do things !, 
  g'wan the fuck .

  in france we had ceremonies yesterday for [ ve day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_in_europe_day ) . 
  groucho may have got all the attention , but karl was always my favourite of the brothers . 
   those guys can not be french because they are n't ethnically french . 
  i was at a ceremony yesterday to mark ve day . 
  it was held at the local cemetery and there were wreaths laid at the * monument des morts * . 
  after the ceremony i took some time to visit some graves . 
  most were from wwi , i think because wounded soldiers were brought from the trenches back to the local hospital , and many of them subsequently died of their injuries . 
  among the crosses in the cemetery there were plenty of gravestones with some form of minaret on the top , [ like this one ] ( http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/bc19c5d63cb0458683936d4ca49a6954/islamic-headstone-in-the-french-national-cemetery-la-ncropole-nationale-ce58xj.jpg ) . 
  these generally had north african or islamic names engraved on them , along with * mort pour la france * as they 'd died in combat . 
  the dates on the gravestones ? 
  oh about 100 years ago ... for over 100 years africans have been dying for france , yet some dopey fucks on the internet will claim that they 're not french because they 're brown or because they 're muslim . 
  these alt-right cunts who 've never done anything significant with their lives question the nationality of men who fought and died for france . 
  art and culture : france has an appreciation of a wide range of artistic forms . 
  comics/graphic novels are very popular across all ages . 
  film is treated very seriously , with genuine respect for art-house film-making , while still producing some hollywood-style blockbusters . 
  the country is also home to some of the greatest visual art in the world . 
  sport : one of the great rugby nations , with an enviable professional set up , but football is by far the most popular sport . 
  handball is gaining ground . 
  has a horse racing tradition that 's similar to that found in the uk and ireland . 
  french people generally are quite sporty and outdoorsy . 
  food : a rich and varied cuisine leads to food being a national obsession . 
  the school canteen publishes menus a month in advance , so parents know what their kids will eat over the next four weeks . 
  the canteen food is generally very varied , exposing kids to a wide range of dishes . 
  i appreciate this very much , as my kids discover food at the canteen and ask me to prepare it for them at home . 
  france benefits from a range of climates and soil types , such that pretty much all food groups are well represented in french cuisine . 
  i 'm very integrated !, 
  i celebrate le st patrick , i eat at la pataterie , and i order guinness by the pinte !, 
  the scene : * wembley arena , mid summer . 
  the stage is lit with an enormous lighting rig ; dry ice blows in clouds across the stage and over the mosh pit . 
  * theresa may strides on stage wearing tight leather trousers , platform heels , and a sleeveless leather tunic . 
  over her shoulder is slung a fender stratocaster . 
  a single spotlight picks her out as the rest of the rig goes dark . 
  she picks out her intro and begins to sing ... `` there 's colors on the street : red , white and blue . 
  people shufflin ' their feet . 
  people sleepin ' in their shoes . 
  but there 's a warnin ' sign on the road ahead . 
  there 's a lot of people sayin ' we 'd be better off dead . 
  do n't feel like satan , but i am to them . 
  so i try to forget it , any way i can . 
  strong and stable in the u k , strong and stable in the u k , strong and stable in the u k , strong and stable in the u k. 
  but `` abstention '' is not voting at all . 
  you could say : more registered voters did n't vote for macron than did vote for macron . 
  but in fact you do n't know that those who did n't vote at all are not macron supporters . 
  the polls were pretty clear that he 'd win , so maybe they were confident . 
  it 's a holiday weekend , so presumably some people were traveling and could n't vote . 
  or maybe they 're not that interested because they 're already doing okay . 
  you assert above that :  macron has a majority of his country against him from day one . 
  but you simply do n't have any evidence to support that . 
  what can be said , with a high level of confidence , is that among those who feel strongly enough about politics to exercise a vote , a majority has voted in favor of macron . 
   it 's no more offensive i think people are more likely to be amused than offended . 
  we expect russia to be anti-macron . 
  big hairy gay men are called * bears * for a reason ... 
   more people voted for not macron than voted for macron . 
  no that 's wrong . 
  there were 35,467,172 votes cast , and he received 20,753,798 . 
  so more people for macron than voted for not macron .
