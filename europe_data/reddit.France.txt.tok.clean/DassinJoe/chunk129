   the supposed ` armchair ' does n't even appear to have arms !, 
  looks like a dining chair . 
  `` pushing london towards a defensive stance '' ... 
  i think london has done that by themselves : * bojo talking about `` punishment beatings '' * * crush the saboteurs * from the daily mail , talking about their own house of lords * the telegraph talking about [ `` remain saboteurs '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/28/theresa-may-must-show-remain-saboteurs-boss-brexit/ ) , even applying this to [ heseltine ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/17/theresa-may-has-no-time-brexit-saboteurs-lord-heseltines-sacking/ ) * * enemies of the people * from the daily mail , talking about the high court judges this is n't the behaviour of a country at ease with itself . 
  the rhetoric from theresa may is that of a prime minister under siege , but this is a situation of her own making and it 's intended to attract votes . 
  some say * theresa may * ; we say * theresa will * !, 
  watch boris get his johnson trapped in a foreign orifice !, 
  michael gove her one see disgraced former defense secretary liam with a fox !, 
   my point is that this place is an europhile echo chamber . 
  breaking news : / r/europe is europhile and now here 's anne with the weather . 
   it 's a matter for ~ ~ northern ~ ~ ireland and the uk . 
  ftfy . 
   unless you can prove that not a single one is for le pen the headline is just wrong . 
  wtf ? 
  you should n't interpret a headline as a universal truth . 
  it 's a summary of something that happened . 
  it 's terse and is written for impact . 
  if you read the headline : bees found in jar of jam do you expect that every single bee in existence was located in this jar of jam ? 
  top models speak out against unrealistic body size expectations in fashion industry do you think that every single top model has spoken , or a few of them have commented ? 
  farage is the best recruiter to the cause of irish nationalism since julia roberts played kitty kiernan . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af you might have watched many association football games , but you clearly know sweet fuck all about rugby . 
  nah , it was just a guess and you 've confirmed it . 
   what really concerns me is the apparent lack of good will coming from both sides . 
  again there 's a certain amount of editorializing that goes on to present things as more oppositional than they really are . 
  i see t_d is leaking again . 
  * n\u00e1 bac le mac an bhacaigh ... *, 
  reckon i 'd trust wwii resistance fighters more than i 'd trust you . 
  lol . 
  the game that is now called `` rugby football '' evolved from the game that is now called `` association football '' . 
  they 're both clearly football , just as gay marriage is clearly marriage . 
   is civil union something a straight couple can get into ? 
  yeah usually . 
   gay marriage is like playing football with rules of rugby . 
  oh right . 
  like in the game that 's officially called ** [ rugby football ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rugby_football ) ? 
  ** what 's funny is that this is a very good analogy , but for completely the opposite reason than you intended . 
  yeah , but for this and a variety of other reasons she 's going to have to get rid of the constitutional council ... 
  the irish term means both [ * wasteland , desert * ] ( http://edil.qub.ac.uk/21330 ) and [ * fertile , abundance * ] ( http://edil.qub.ac.uk/21331 ) .

   they 're voting for change no , the child quoted is too young to vote . 
   dressed in blue and red stripped t-shirts , a group of school pupils , aged between 14 and 17-years-old , were franticly waving french flags and boards with ms le pen 's slogan `` choose france '' . 
   `` we are france 's future and this is what we want , '' said one of the girls , from the wealthy area of versailles in the south west of the french capital . 
  hmmm , the group is aged 14-17 and co-ordinated wearing a [ marini\u00e8re ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marini%c3%a8re ) . 
  this particular girl has crossed paris from versailles in the south west to villepinte in the north east . 
  she might not be completely independent of parental influence ... 
  i note that the author is a member of the parti de gauche , founded by m\u00e9lenchon . 
   a deliberate effort among intellectuals and mainstream politicians to engineer a run-off between macron and the far-right marine le pen this is tinfoil hat territory and is presented without a shred of evidence except vague references to paris match . 
  it also contradicts the main assertion of the article : if the ` establishment ' can really fine tune voter behaviour in this way , why is it suddenly possible that mlp will be elected ? 
  le pen has a hardcore 23 % or 24 % of voters . 
  no matter what she does , 95 % + of these will vote for her . 
  she can hope to attract about 30 % of fillon 's supporters . 
  he got 19 % , so 30 % of that ( 6 % ) would get her from 24 % to 30 % . 
  with less than a week to the second round , it 's more important for her to be associated with fillon than to avoid accusations of plagiarism . 
  this way , many headlines are written with the names `` fillon '' and `` le pen '' plus some descriptors like `` copying '' or `` close to '' or `` matches '' . 
  i recently renewed my irish passport online and it was quite speedy .

  your comment is very much * \u00e0 point * . 
  my response was more targeted at the final sentence :  i do not like this piece -- i do n't think that it 's worthy of an objective discussion . 
  did i say it was antisemitic ? 
  it 's historical revisionism . 
  it denies france 's role in the killing of french jews . 
  hume worked tirelessly for peace in northern ireland for over 30 years . 
  a man of amazing integrity and perseverance . 
   theres no being a prick/dick here i would n't be so certain . 
  that 'd be a rare sight all right . 
  well done police . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  i had n't heard about them getting as far as iceland . 
   they would vastly outnumber the ira at its peak . 
  there are very few loyalist paramilitaries now ; where will all the new ones come from ? 
   it 'll be bloody costly for the emerald isle . 
  short term yes , but over the 50-100 year timeframe it could be very advantageous . 
  [ how about this one ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/25/le-pen-far-right-holocaust-revisionist-macron-left ) ? 
   ( le pen ) insisted that the vichy regime `` was not france '' , an approach to history that redefines the term `` selective '' . 
  she added that the 1942 vel d\u2019hiv round-up , when 13,000 jews were rounded up in paris , was n't the responsibility of france . 
  ( spoiler !, 
  it was , and , in fact , the french police rounded up jewish children , which the nazis had n't even asked them to do . ), 
  and it 's high ho silver lining ...
