  there was a period of relative calm during the 00s , but it looks like that was exceptional . 
  in any case , we do n't let terrorists determine our behaviour - that 's what they want and fuck them they wo n't win . 
  french media are reporting three men and a woman held since early this morning . 
  two french-born men of turkish origin plus an islamist `` already well known to the anti-terrorism '' services . 
  no weapons recovered but some computer equipment seized . 
  edit : also a kalashnikov cartridge seized . 
  veterans today [ profile ] ( http://ppia.wikia.com/wiki/veterans_today ) for what it 's worth . 
  these guys have no class whatsoever . 
  he looks like the outcome of [ care in the community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/care_in_the_community ) style policies . 
  looks too small an explosion for a car bomb attack . 
  driver was the target i expect . 
  if possible yes , but who knows how long it will take for a stable regime in syria . 
  i 'd like him locked up now . 
   since his 2012 trial ... he has had just one visitor , his mother , who was allowed into prison and gave him a hug shortly before she died of cancer in 2013 . 
  his poor mother . 
  i hope her ghost haunts his dreams . 
  edit : fair enough - i did n't realize she treated him badly . 
  though there 's simply no comparison with his actions . 
  i still hope she haunts his dreams . 
  posted two days ago [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a4y2d/majority_of_french_defends_a_referendum_on/d0xqr8p ), 
  let 's clear things up a bit . 
  the point of `` je suis charlie '' is that people were killed specifically for exercising their right to free speech . 
  `` i am charlie '' was a way people chose to say `` i will continue to exercise my right to free speech even though thugs with guns try to take it away . '', 
  does it make any difference to the victims ? 
  no , because they 're dead , but it 's an important political statement about free speech , even if it 's expressed in a twee way . 
  the ` stand with paris ' or whatever it was ( people changing their profile pictures to a flag background ) is much closer to what 's happening in ankara . 
  terrorists are killing innocent people for political ends . 
  the killings are random and inhuman . 
  so of course i ` stand with ankara ' , for whatever good it will do the people of ankara . 
  of course i empathize , having grown up in a place with all-too frequent bombings . 
  of course i 'm horrified at the randomness of the killings . 
  but i do n't need to wear my feelings publicly like some sort of badge . 
  i did n't express much when paris was attacked and some people i knew were impacted . 
  i wo n't express much when ankara is attacked by suicide bombers . 
  i might if it 's an issue of free speech because that 's a different principle . 
  all of the `` sky is falling '' comments are missing an important point : a despicable fuckhead has been locked up in sweden . 
  that should be reason for cheerfulness . 
  oh it was of course yes . 
  but it 's a good indication of how deep and abiding boris 's love is . 
  i appreciate it and benefit from it . 
  i 've worked in six different eu countries . 
  i studied in two partly with the aid of an eu grant . 
  i 've visited twelve eu countries over the years . 
  a lot of this would have been possible without the eu , but it would 've been a lot more administrative hassle , and i hate administrative hassle . 
  any chance that the place where the lander touches down could be named for david bowie ? 
  this is if the acronym/abbrevation can be enunciated as a word . 
  if it is spelled out , like eec , oecd , imf , it remains in all caps . 
  he loves it so much that he [ renounced his american citizenship last year ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-tax-bill-mayor-london/385554/ ) . 
  yes , cote d'ivoire is the biggest exporter of cocoa in the world , also exports petroleum , coffee , and other ` equatorial ' farm produce . 
  abidjan is a regional hub for many businesses in west africa . 
  it looks like [ lots of countries ] ( http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/us-hellfire-missile-orders-fy-2011-2014-07019/ ) have bought these missiles . 
  they seem intended for air launching ( helicopters and drones ) , is it possible to launch them from the ground ? 
  edit : answering my own question : [ yes ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/39517/hellfire-launch-from-ground-es14e3 ) but it 's non-trivial . 
   lockheed martin hellfire missiles have been fired from a ground vehicle for the first time using a moog third-generation stores management system . 
  the sms provides the interface between the targeting sensors , operator stations , command and control systems , and the weapon launchers . 
  there 's an argument for limiting coverage of a terrorist attack * while events are still unfolding * . 
  when the kouachi brothers ( charlie hebdo massacre ) were trapped inside a signage works , there was a worker hidden in the building with them for about 8 hours . 
  they did n't know he was there but a politician spoke about him on radio and then a couple of tv stations picked it up . 
  this was a serious fuck up by the media . 
   driving leyland cars and telling mercedes and bmw to shove it and here we arrive at clarkson 's real reason for staying in eu . 
  anything that makes paris even prettier gets my support . 
  it 's a poor majority at 53 % and there are still more people who want to stay in the eu ( 45 % ) than leave ( 33 % ) or express no opinion ( 22 % ) , even within the confines if this poll . 
  when life gives you lemons ... 
   part of the anger behind the no tav movement lies in its general disaffection with italy 's corruption . 
  opponents of the line believe that key beneficiaries will be not ordinary italians but shady forces in the construction industry . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  seriously , attacking a massive and wonderful engineering project because your country is too corrupt ? 
  it 's the wrong way to go about reform . 
  interesting stories and clearly the two guys were n't fleeing an impossible situation in afghanistan , otherwise they could n't have gone back . 
  the guy who found a job in kabul eventually should have gone there in the first place rather than wasting his savings being smuggled to germany . 
  the guy who wanted to study psychology ... 
  he 's an economic migrant . 
  as in topsoil ? 
  turf sometimes , or topsoil , or just the ground . 
  for racecourses , turf would be pretty standard . 
  good news that they 've been caught . 
  thanks for the summary . 
  peat is commonly referred to as turf in ireland when cut and dried . 
  [ example1 ] ( http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/geography/bogs.html ) , [ example2 ] ( http://www.irishamericanmom.com/2015/01/19/what-is-irish-turf/ ), 
  the turf cut from the ground gives about half the heat of coal , i think . 
  maybe 10 % less than dry wood . 
  the compressed briquettes give better heat . 
  in dublin this happens with guinness every ten days or so . 
  i think they might be flushing the vats and the smell can travel for several kilometres . 
  a fire like a ground/bush fire ? 
  i associate turf fires mostly with being in the west of ireland , but if people are burning peat briquettes you can get the smell anywhere . 
  ireland smells of turf ( peat ) smoke . 
  it 's a bit like the taste of laphroaig ( the scottish whisky ) . 
  this article was in the guardian last week , then the irish times , now in irish central . 
   it 's new becoming a communist . 
  i know , and i wish it would be replaced with something else . 
  no , i do n't either . 
  this is coming from the lib dems , who are basically nowhere in uk politics at the moment . 
  the independent has been calling for cannabis legalisation for decades , if i remember correctly . 
  maybe started in the early 90s ? 
  wow , she was 15 when she was arrested . 
  teens should get back to drinking and smoking for their rebellion . 
  enough of this islamism nonsense . 
   before the conflict , syria had roughly 31,000 doctors , according to the country 's ministry of health . 
  today , physicians for human rights ( phr ) estimates that about half have left the country ; hundreds more medical personnel have been detained or killed .
