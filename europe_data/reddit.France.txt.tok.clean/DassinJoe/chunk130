  you have nothing to lose but your markov chains !, 
  how is not bothering to vote anything other than disengaging with the electoral process ? 
   you can be equally not ok with both choices . 
  `` indifferent '' between the choices is perhaps a better way to describe it . 
  edit : i misunderstood initially . 
   what is france like ? 
  lovely place , imo . 
  i even enjoy the paris region . 
   merkel is merely stating the obvious . 
  i wonder what the british tabloids will make of that . 
  #mutti merkel murders may 's marvelous masterplan, 
   they met on a dating website called thai cupid . 
  i 'm disappointed that these islanders do n't go reaving and claim salt wives for themselves . 
  not voting at all is disengaging with the process completely . 
  it 's another way to express indifference to the outcome . 
  fair play man . 
   or are these actions so clearly understood in france ? 
  this is just my interpretation and it 's a consequentialist ( rather than deontological ) point of view . 
  in a two-way race , i should not spoil my vote unless i 'm okay with either outcome . 
  from what i can see , a voter in this case has three choices for the second round : do n't vote at all . 
  this is disengaging with the process because his/her preferred candidate has been eliminated . 
  this is the same as saying `` democracy is important only when my preference is available '' . 
  spoil the vote ( vote blanc ) . 
  this is engaging with the process but refusing to express a preference between the remaining candidates . 
  this is the same as saying `` i 'm fine with either outcome for the second round '' . 
  vote for one candidate based on a preference . 
  this is transferring their vote from a preferred ( eliminated ) candidate to a less preferred one who is nevertheless rated more highly than the other . 
  this maximizes the value of their personal vote . 
  healthcare , education , social welfare , taxation levels , defense : these are all immediate subjects to be considered general election . 
  clearly they 'll all be somewhat affected by brexit in the future , but the impact is still unclear . 
  people vote on immediate issues , rather than hypotheticals . 
  there 's more than just brexit to consider in a general election 2 . 
  the libdems imploded last election and it takes time to rebuild a political base 3 . 
  the tory political base , in contrast , is in very good shape 4 . 
  the tories are currently doing a better job than labour or the libdems, 
   the percentage of people who do not know has remained steady at 12 per cent since 10 january . 
  that 's the figure to watch over the coming months/years . 
  because of their emotional investment , those who have strong feelings about leave/remain will have difficulty acknowledging negatives/positives stemming from the brexit process . 
  those who admit they `` do n't know '' are at least keeping an open mind . 
   my mother makes working her ass off get a job yourself . 
  thought it was 2nd most ? 
   or protectionists see the value in producing close to the consumers to reduce environmental impact funniest thing i read today . 
  up voted . 
  which is historically a subsidiary of the tories in fairness . 
  i see it now . 
  is there a correlation coefficient identified somewhere . 
  define `` poor correlation '' ? 
  i 'm seeing a pretty clear line of best fit on that chart . 
  richard of york gave battle in vain ( red orange yellow green blue indigo violet ), 
   another eu shakedown pretty sure the investigation into this predates brexyref . 
  looks like they pushed the undervalued trade more and more as they got away with it - normal trade was fairly constant at about 400m kg , undervalued was steadily increasing . 
  an old term in english was `` french letter '' . 
  moral relativism and false equivalence . 
  a trade deal could fail for any number of reasons . 
  standing idly by while people are murdered is abhorrent . 
  i 'm strongly in favour of a mutually beneficial eu/uk trade deal , but making it contingent on security cooperation is repugnant . 
  you 're basically saying : `` give us what we want or we will allow your citizens to be killed . '', 
  charming . 
   losing access to intelligence on terrorists how will it play out when there 's an attack on the continent and it turns out the uk knew about it in advance but did n't warn the country concerned ? 
  le penis less mighty than le condom . 
  trump actually did better among the religious right than romney did , because even though he 's a serial adulterer and probably an atheist , at least he 's not a mormon :-), 
  fuck.you.i.did.not.beg.for.anything . 
  great , and while you sacrifice the country on a point of principle , immigrants like me will have to fuck off out of here . 
   refusing to be an alibi for liberals and or racists is fighting tooth and nail , because the day she gets in power we will need people who did n't ally with her real enablers to be a legitimate opposition . 
  you want to make it easier for her to get into power in order to bring on the cataclysm ? 
  throwing their toys out of the pram . 
   subhurb of paris are a place where white are minority , in a few suburbs maybe , but in most of them whites are a majority . 
  in any case , mostly they 're voting centrist according to the map . 
  yes , the latest leaflets i 've seen have no mention of the fn , no mention of her family name , just `` marine '' with a big blue rose . 
  no i mean abolishing it completely . 
  just abolish income tax , everyone can have a massive party during your government , then leave the bill for the next party to get elected . 
   those are coming up in a few weeks . 
  11th and 18th june, 
  part of le pen 's recent success is in the post-industrial areas in nord/pas de calais . 
  these areas were strongly socialist or even communist for years but they appear to be disillusioned with the left after years of high unemployment and economic decline . 
  one thing i have n't seen discussed is the primaries . 
  both ps and lr held open primaries to select their candidate ( 2nd time for ps , 1st for lr ) . 
  now both candidates have failed to progress ... would greater party of the selection process have changed the outcome ? 
  i certainly think jupp\u00e9 would 've done better than fillon . 
  abolishing income tax would be a vote winner , but probably just for one election . 
  lol . 
  did you create a new account just to spout that drivel ? 
   but he suggested that politicians should deal with ** perception ** of excessive immigration that people are voicing . 
  not in the sequence of posts that i replied to . 
  perhaps elsewhere ? 
   no income tax ** or ** minimum wage . 
  should that be `` or '' or `` on '' ? 
  the logical way to deal with an excess of something is to limit that thing . 
  this brings me back to my original statement . 
  i 'm not advocating this by the way ; i 'm trying to understand what the op means by `` taking fn voters ' concerns into account '' . 
  for my part , i think immigration is a small part of the explanation of the fn 's recent growth , and direct economic issues are more important . 
   what he wrote which is `` people have concerns over immigration and those people 's fear should be addressed '' . 
  you 're missing the key word `` excessive '' immigration in the op 's statement . 
  i was very clear about this and i do n't understand why you missed it twice . 
   many non far right people who vote for le pen vote for her because of their concerns of excessive immigration, 
   no , it 's not , you simplify it too much . 
  i think you need to read what i wrote again . 
  hmmm , most of the towns i 'm thinking of are very industrial and very working class . 
  probably there is a strong presence of organized labour and politicized workers who are voting for m\u00e9lenchon . 
  there 'd also be a history of strong communist local government .
