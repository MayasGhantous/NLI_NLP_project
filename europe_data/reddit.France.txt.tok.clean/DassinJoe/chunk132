  mlp promises to replace gay marriage by a civil arrangement . 
  married gay french men are less likely than single gay french men to use a dating app . 
  married gay french men , on average , are likely to care more about the `` marriage vs. civil partnership '' debate . 
  if mlp is polling at 20 % of dating app users , there are strong grounds to expect that she 'd poll lower among the wider population . 
   the platform is openly anti-lgbt i think it 's more quietly anti-lgbt these days . 
  they 've toned it down a lot and hidden the repeal of the loi taubira under point 80-something in the manifesto .

  * absorbing * ? 
  what do you think a person doing a job does ? 
  do they somehow consume that job ? 
  what 's the purpose of a job ? 
   no , it 's a belief that only the top , say , 2-5 % of scientists contribute to society . 
  stopped reading after that line . 
   if the eu was really well meaning and good why would they be wishing harm on the uk ? 
  there 's a weird anthropomorphism that treats the eu as a single mind , either benevolent or malign . 
  it 's not a single mind , it 's a collection of interests , some competing and some cooperating . 
  the eu does n't `` wish '' anything for the uk . 
  the eu will negotiate a deal with the uk , and that deal will prioritize eu interests . 
  it 's quite simple : there 's no good guy or bad guy in the story . 
  it 's a collection of states negotiating with a single state , that 's all . 
  sounds like driving my kids . 
  okay , so i 'm not 100 % sure what we 're discussing . 
  the original point concerned schr\u00f6dinger 's immigrant , who will both steal your job and live off government handouts . 
  the comment i responded to claims that there is very little net benefit to society of allowing immigrants , positioning this as a `` belief '' that only the top few percent of expert immigrants have a net positive effect on jobs . 
  this is contrary to most research that i 'm aware of : in general , immigrants have a net positive effect on an economy . 
  now if you want to talk about the specific question of `` creating a job that would otherwise not have existed '' , you 're getting into the realm of case studies to be honest . 
  what we can say at a macro level is that if an economy is close to full employment ( c. 5 % unemployment ) , adding more workers will expand both production and consumption and in so doing create jobs . 
  if an economy is not at full employment , this becomes more nuanced and there are very sensible arguments to be made about limiting immigration when unemployment is high .

  trudeau totally beat trump in the handshake game though . 
  one of the most erudite novelists of the late 20th century . 
  his style is sometimes brilliant and sometimes lacking , but his content is always worthwhile . 
  i think your argument boils down to `` he ca n't have said that because that would be too stupid a thing to say '' , but bear in mind that this david davis we 're discussing . 
  what ? 
  `` davis has claimed agencies could stay in london after brexit '' ? 
  it 's a reflection of the newspaper articles , and as i have shown it 's not inconsistent with the actual quotation . 
  just as your interpretation is not inconsistent . 
  we are going round in circles . 
  i 've defended my initial post and yes i stand by it . 
  did you write the deleted comment ? 
   you have interpreted it to be `` david davis claims that the eba and ema can stay in the uk post brexit '' specifically , i have interpreted it to mean : a : * a spokesperson for davis 's ministry has stated that the post-brexit location of the eba and ema is to be negotiated as part of the wider brexit negotiations . 
  * this is the interpretation that the ft went with too . 
  some tory press picked it up as well . 
  it 's perfectly defensible based upon the quotation : b : `` the location of the european banking authority or the european medicines agency ... will be subject to the exit negotiations '' you may want to defend davis or his ministry , but please do n't accuse me of dishonesty when doing so . 
  [ oecd ] ( https://www.oecd.org/migration/oecd%20migration%20policy%20debates%20numero%202.pdf ) [ university college london ] ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/reports/wa_final_final.pdf ) [ nber ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w16736.pdf ) there 's plenty of research about the economic effects of migration . 
  in touch with the ground, 
   no , i am simply saying what the statement said literally . 
  no you 're simply not . 
  the statement said literally : `` the location of the european banking authority or the european medicines agency ... will be subject to the exit negotiations '' this is the closest we can get to distill the meaning of the original statement . 
  we are using the same words and removing only the extraneous information . 
  you 've interpreted this to mean `` the timetable to move the eba and the ema will be subject to the exit negotiations '' . 
  that 's not a literal statement of the original content - it 's an interpretation ( perhaps extrapolation ) . 
  maybe it 's justified , maybe not . 
  i invited you to support this interpretation with some clarification from the government . 
  presumably such clarification does n't exist or you 'd have offered it by now . 
  no , this is where we stand : * we have two interpretations of a single statement . 
  * the media 's interpretation is the simpler . 
  * yours is the more convoluted . 
  unless you can point me to a clarification from the government that gives the same explanation you 've given , we 're better to err on the side of caution and take the simpler interpretation . 
  so instead of speaking about `` location '' the minstry for brexiting brexit should have spoken about `` timetable for relocation '' ? 
  and you blame the media !, 
   i think it is accurate to say that the location of the eba and the ema will be the subject of the exit negotiations . 
  in what way will the location be the subject of the exit negotiations ? 
  are you saying that the uk will veto certain locations ? 
  promote certain locations ? 
  if the eba and ema are leaving london with 100 % certainty , what is the point of their location being part of the negotiation ? 
  no it 's more than that . 
  per the ft article :  `` no decisions have been taken about the location of the european banking authority or the european medicines agency -- these will be subject to the exit negotiations . '', 
  location is subject to negotiation =  agencies could stay we 've established that davis is responsible for his ministry , so i think i 've proven my original statement :  that paragon of competence and professionalism , brexit secretary david davis , claimed on monday that the european medicines agency and the european banking authority could stay in london after brexit . 
  qed and pat myself on the back . 
  is davis responsible for the actions of his department ? 
  i have to reply again because original was removed . 
  he did yes , or someone in his dept did , which amounts to the same thing . 
  it 's very confusing when my comments get deleted by a bot ( because i linked to google 's cache of an express article ) . 
  the first link was to the ft , the second was to the express . 
  i can provide many more if you want . 
  davis 's department said this , and multiple sources attributed it to him . 
  i am not being untruthful . 
  i resent that accusation . 
  i am giving an accurate representation of uk media stories about this subject . 
  you should bear in mind that davis is ultimately responsible for the statements of his spokespeople . 
  see below my reply to / u/trucidator actually , that comment was deleted because it linked the express . 
  [ here 's the ft ] ( https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_a1nq7ynajmj:https://www.ft.com/content/72ead180-229a-11e7-8691-d5f7e0cd0a16+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fr ), 
  that 's insane . 
  whole new type of scots separatism ... 
  that paragon of competence and professionalism , brexit secretary david davis , claimed on monday that the european medicines agency and the european banking authority could stay in london after brexit . 
   theresa may will make a formal pledge ahead of the june 8 election to end european union free movement of people into britain there 's nothing surprising here ; the only interesting point is * when * she will end it . 
  and in the easter spirit of forgiveness , shall we forget about previous tory pledges to reduce migration ?

  saucission with pastis ... 
  i guess it could be okay but not the first combination i would think of . 
  ... but what about a drinking game ? 
   i never said anything about sending people home so why are you going off on one ? 
  you wrote :  in 2002 immigrants were about 8 % if the workforce in the uk , it has risen to over over a third . 
  we had mcdonalds before , we had hgv drivers before we had carers before . 
  brits were doing those jobs your basic point is `` immigrants are taking jobs from brits '' . 
  i disagree . 
  if there were no immigrants ( send them home , or just give them the day off ) , and using your numbers , there 'll be ** 8.5 million jobs that do n't get done ** . 
  it 's not a strawman .
