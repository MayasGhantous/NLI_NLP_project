  yes that was likelihood of winning , so 0.85 to 0.15 is a better way to express it . 
  is tonight the last debate ? 
  if yes , has anyone come up with a drinking game ? 
  spontaneous pregnancies the night he 's elected ? 
   france 's real issue is economic competitiveness , or lack thereof . 
  not really : [ french exports are doing okay ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/exports ) . 
  it 's more to do with economic flexibility , responsiveness , and job formation . 
   i believe that only absolute elite workers , say , the top 2-5 % of engineers and scientists have any chance of engaging in net job creation . 
  you want to run society based on your ` belief ' ? 
  how about looking at some data instead ? 
   in 2002 immigrants were about 8 % if the workforce in the uk , it has risen to over over a third . 
  we had mcdonalds before , we had hgv drivers before we had carers before . 
  brits were doing those jobs your numbers are wrong , but anyway let 's think about this logically . 
  uk unemployment rate is 5 % . 
  number of people in work is 31 million . 
  if one third of these are immigrants , that 's 10 million jobs . 
  if you send all the immigrants home tomorrow , the 5 % unemployed could fill how many jobs ? 
  about 1.5 million , leaving you with 8.5 million jobs `` unfilled '' . 
  what happens next ? 
  what happens when there 's nobody to sweep the supermarket floor or clean the offices or wipe the arse of an incontinent 95 year old ? 
  no , i work in r&d . what brought me here ? 
  quality of life . 
  been working here nearly 20 years . 
  erasmus for me was long long ago . 
  true . 
  thank goodness we have the surpluses of the industrious north to fund our dilettante ways . 
  why 's that ? 
   `` i live near the muslims . 
  they do n't work . 
  they just take what they 're given by the government , '' he said . 
   but they 're also taking french jobs , he argued minutes later . 
  `` i work mostly with foreigners -- people from turkey , '' he said . 
  bloody schr\u00f6dinger 's immigrants at it again ... 
  they 've picked up a lot of dissatisfied socialist voters in the last 10 years , especially in the post-industrial areas . 
  the main pillars for the fn are immigration , economic sovereignty ( protectionism ) , and cultural conservatism . 
  mlp has done quite a good job keeping a balance between the ex-leftists who care mostly about the economy and the rightists who want to wind back the clock on certain social issues . 
  she also has to keep the old xenophobic core happy , as they 're the source of most donations . 
   court of session the scots supreme court ? 
  for a student newspaper article ? 
   french people seem to me over emotional does n't matter a fuck to me mate , i 'm irish . 
  the breathtakingly stupid comment you made about france being perhaps worse than turkey probably pissed some of them off . 
  i 'm just amazed at how little you understood about the comic . 
  do you still think it 's about napolean/calais/terror attacks and not about the election that 's going to happen next sunday ? 
  it 's quite funny that you 're reposting something you ca n't explain . 
  about 28 % of possible voters do n't plan to vote on sunday ( 1st round ) . 
  if there 's a terror attack in the meantime , some of them ( maybe 5 % ? ), 
  might decide to turn out for le pen . 
  she might pick up some votes from other candidates , but so too would fillon i expect . 
  if there 's an attack between the 1st and 2nd round , it will depend very much on who is running . 
  assuming le pen gets through , i think she 'd gain more votes from a terror attack if she 's against macron or melenchon than if she 's against fillon . 
  no , you 've just completely misunderstood the joke that you reposted . 
   the joke is franceball is gon na go on a rant how he 's having such a hard time , which he is , you 've completely misunderstood the joke . 
  yeah good luck washing that mental image away ... 
   the joke is about complaining , its not about who has the hardest life , the frenchball feels he has a lot to complain about no , the joke is about doing stupid/reckless things . 
  the us/uk/turkish balls are boasting about the stupid/reckless things they 've done . 
  the french ball overhears them and says `` hold my wine '' because he 's about to go and do something stupid/reckless . 
  nope , [ they 're mates now ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2017/03/inevitably-nigel-farage-and-marine-le-pen-are-now-buddies ) . 
  i think farage even claimed that mlp fancies him . 
   perhaps even turkey 's problems are pretty small compared to france 's right now lol . 
  you have n't read much about turkey i take it ? 
   no , this is just us showing the you the door . 
   god i hate that xkcd strip . 
  love them all , especially ghent . 
  in lille , the area around la [ grande place and la place du th\u00e9\u00e2tre ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/hippopotamus/@50.638166,3.0616077,214a,35y,112.02h,44.94t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c2d60fe22042df:0x5ed7f1108bbc0dfa!8m2!3d50.6369264!4d3.0651993 ) is visually/architecturally interesting . 
  it 's a terrible picture of her . 
  it seems i 'm obliged to repeat myself . 
  the examples i 've cited are symptomatic of a society that considers itself at war . 
  one of the characteristics of a society at war ( real or imagined ) is that there 's no room for dissent . 
   you just do n't like some of the opinions expressed . 
  no , i do n't like the stifling of dissent . 
  you 're self-aware in your role as tongue-in-cheek etc. 
    the brexit process is increasingly presented as a war by the uk media and establishment . 
   sweeping statement based on reading a few newspaper headlines . 
  a few headlines ? 
  let 's take a quick stock : judges say parliament must vote on art 50 - tory press calls them `` traitors '' . 
  gibraltar - tory press is ready to go to war . 
  michael `` prince of darkness '' howard wants to go to war !, 
  ge election call - crush the saboteurs !, 
  i watched question time there a few weeks ago , and the tory mp scolded tim farron for `` talking the country down '' because he said that maybe a 51.8 / 48.2 split suggest a ` soft brexit ' was preferable to a ` hard brexit ' . 
  cue applause from the audience . 
  these attempts to forbid contrary viewpoints are symptomatic of a society that 's at war . 
   you 're quite clearly twisting that part . 
  no i 'm not . 
  i 've read it multiple times . 
  here 's the most [ recent example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65lmqt/support_for_brexit_hits_a_fivemonth_high_with_55/dgbw7l8/ )  i wanted to stay but seeing how feeble some people are on here i want to leave, 
  the brexit process is increasingly presented as a war by the uk media and establishment . 
  there 's a sense among many uk posters on this site that britain is besieged by the rest of the eu . 
  this is partly due to the discourse within the uk , and partly due to the attitude of other eu posters who consider brexit to be a mistake . 
  i 've even seen uk posters say things like `` i voted * remain * but now that i see the attitude of posters from other countries , i 'm supporting * leave * ... '' of course this boils down to `` someone was mean to me on the internet , so i 've changed my opinion about a real world event '' . 
  anyway , imo everyone needs to chill the fuck out . 
  the uk and eu will continue to be essential trading partners when the brexit process is a distant memory . 
  do n't let yourselves be swayed by jingoistic nationalism . 
  yeah , i think that 's where we disagree . 
  i expect she 'll get her parliamentary majority , though it might not be as strong as she 's expecting . 
  you consider a parliamentary majority a mandate , but i think a mandate is a more difficult requirement to meet . 
  i do n't think she 'll come out of this with a mandate in the sense of  50 % of voters supporting her , even in england . 
  it 's a nice construction - difficult to appreciate the scale until you walk among the buildings . 
   i love my country and its culture - i 'd never sacrifice it but you do n't seem to have much interest in devolution ? 
  is there any point in having a scottish parliament ? 
   i do n't see how you 're disproving my point ?
