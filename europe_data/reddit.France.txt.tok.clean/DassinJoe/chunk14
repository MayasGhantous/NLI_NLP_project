  germany hosts over 1500 syrian physicians , and many of them are likely to remain after the war in syria ends . 
  germany needs them too , with one in seven physicians planning to retire over the next five years . 
  the future of healthcare in syria is looking bleak . 
  lol , 10 other discussions . 
  did n't this get posted back in january when it was published ? 
  i thought about gini coefficients , but i ruled them out because some people like inequality ;-), 
  a few other metrics that might be worth considering : * sweden life expectancy 2015 = 81.98 years * germany life expectancy 2015 = 80.57 years * us life expectancy 2015 = 79.68 [ source ] ( http://www.infoplease.com/world/statistics/life-expectancy-country.html ) here 's [ us states listed by life expectancy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_life_expectancy ) , where we can see the poorest states have life expectancy below 76 years . 
  [ world happiness report ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report ) - sweden ranks number 8 , germany ranks number 26 , and the us ranks number 69 . 
  [ intergenerational mobility ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2007/05/useconomics-morton ) : * by some measurements , [ the us is ] actually a less mobile society than many other nations , including canada , france , germany and most scandinavian countries . 
   and yet if you ask these proponents , they rarely can provide even one example of `` excessive regulation '' . 
  yes , but such stories have been a stalwart of the british press for as long as i can remember : `` barmy brussels bureaucrats ban bendy bananas '' - classic example of a [ euromyth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromyth ), 
  some context : the `` new ira '' was previously known as the [ real ira ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_irish_republican_army ) . 
  they are dissidents who oppose the northern ireland peace process . 
  there are more teams that might be worth following . 
  most european leagues have two dominant teams , but even during the `` big 4 dominance '' of the last decade , fans had a choice of four decent teams to support . 
  why might the author be considered a bigot ? 
  well , she refers to people as :  scabrous human detritus for a start . 
  that 's not a phrase i 'd choose to apply to my fellow human beings . 
  why might she be considered an idiot ? 
  she has written a column on the basis that macron claimed  that all the migrants now camping in calais could be pushed into dover but in fact what macron said was  the day this relationship unravels , migrants will no longer be in calais and the financial passport will work less well . 
  our will is not to revise the touquet accord but it would be threatened by such a context . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b6d2b1ce-e12d-11e5-8d9b-e88a2a889797.html#axzz42ceql233 ) this may be alarmist on macron 's part ( e.g. 
  there 's a priori no reason the le touquet agreement could n't continue ) , but he ** clearly did n't say that all the migrants will be pushed into dover ** , even if this is the spin that the uk press has put on it . 
  if 83 % can only be friends with girls , but 73 % ca n't have a ` relationship ' before marriage , does that mean that 10 % are expected to be lesbians ? 
  here 's [ a collection ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/immobilier/en-images-la-france-moche-vos-prix-citron-des-batiments-prives-les-plus-laids-08-11-2013-1753644_31.php ) of ugly buildings in france ; something to suit every taste ... 
  i 'd nominate the caisse d'epargne in bordeaux . 
  marine le pen is a clever politician . 
  she has managed to distance herself somewhat from her father , who is a political liability . 
  she is media-savvy and manages to keep herself in the news headlines for long periods of time . 
  the fn these days is generally on-message and reliable ( unlike , for example ukip , which is repeatedly embarrassed by crazier members ) . 
  candidates , at least the ones i have seen , are generally young , good-looking and well presented . 
  all in all , mlp has transformed the party into a slick political operation . 
  the racism and xenophobia of the fn has been deemphasised . 
  the focus is now on populist issues like economic protectionism , euroskepticism , law and order , and so forth . 
  the last time i checked their website they were against gay marriage but this might be deemphasised in the future . 
  the fn currently has the luxury of many populist parties that offer the moon and the stars but do n't get enough power to ever deliver anything . 
  is mlp influential ? 
  yes insofar as she manages to pull together a very diverse set of interests and has brought her father 's xenophobic movement to the point of almost-respectability . 
  the fn in general has influenced french politics , pushing the center ground over to the right in issues of immigration and crime , and a little to the left in economic issues . 
  it 's difficult but worth it in the end . 
  you 're telling me that a guy called mohammed basil el-cheikh tried to kill hedegaard . 
  is there more to it than that ? 
  i agree . 
  and hard to distinguish 16 from 18 year olds . 
  i do n't have all the answers here , but clearly minors should be protected , at least imo . 
  you 're clearly going to the wrong places . 
  i know it 's an entirely predictable comment , but parents ( or foster parents ) have to be a lot more careful about the stuff their kids are getting into . 
  teenagers are attracted to easy answers , to adventure , to rebellious struggles . 
  their parents ( guardians ) have to be more aware of the risks of online and real-world radicalization . 
  deleting this as it was originally from [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/rush-for-irish-passports-brought-on-by-brexit-fears ) and that was posted already . 
  exactly , the stuff that germany is burning recently is brown coal ( lignite ) , and it 's one of the most polluting ways to produce energy . 
  what a strangely flippant thing to say . 
  these are refugees and economic migrants who entered france in order to try to get to the uk . 
  france did n't invite them ; the uk did n't invite them . 
  quite probably france is not doing enough to protect them given that they 're minors in the eyes of the law . 
  it 's horrific what 's happening to these teenagers , but french policies in favour or against multiculturalism are n't relevant as far as i can tell . 
  you 're welcome . 
  thanks for your politeness . 
  it 's a police report about is supporters from france , where other is supporters killed 130 people last november . 
  maybe my fault for translating `` jeunes fran\u00e7aises '' as `` young frenchwomen '' for want of a closer approximation . 
  it 's available in / r/france [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/48rvo1/a_14_ans_des_jeunes_fran%c3%a7aises_qui_r%c3%aavent_de_tuer/ ) . 
  of the four , two are identified as coming from christian backgrounds in the article . 
  that 's an interesting parallel . 
  i read a commentary recently along the lines of `` if you need fanatics/obsessives , your best bet is to recruit males ages 14-25 '' . 
  the reason i thought this article interesting is because it seems that certain teenage girls and young women are also good candidates . 
  i had geraniums in window boxes that were flowering at christmas time in ile de france . 
  some have since died but a few have made it through . 
  normally i 'd have to bring them indoors to give them a chance of survival through the winter . 
  should have sewn in some nice little homing beacons . 
  the ones that missiles like to follow . 
  ** what judicial response ? 
  ** what judicial response can be brought to these girls recruited by such finely tuned propaganda ? 
  are they dangerous to society or only to themselves ? 
  rarely incarcerated - only three women who 've returned from syria are currently in prison - they are often seen as victims . 
  even though the doctrine of the islamic state thus far dissuades women from combat , preferring to confine them to housework and motherhood , some anti-terrorist judges are concerned that they are `` often more radical than men . '', 
  camille , fatima , juliet and vanessa were indicted for criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise , as was matthieu , the young convert with whom camille conversed on facebook . 
  the first three were placed on judicial probation . 
  vanessa , who eventually abandoned her husband in syria to return to france in july 2015 , after more than a year there , has been incarcerated . 
  after an attempted suicide in prison , the court decided to place vanessa on judicial probation on january 7 , 2016 . 
  as part of her probation , camille enrolled in childcare training and joined the prevention centre program against sectarianism related to islam ( cpdsi ) dounia bouzar . 
  she participated in a video on prevention of is recruitment techniques and met with families whose children had left syria . 
  at a hearing before the judge in september 2014 , the girl seemed to be back down to earth : `` we were all self-indoctrinated , we repeated the words that others had said , it was cutting and pasting , we were like robots , it 's like a cult . '', 
  investigators recently discovered that she still wanted to go to syria . 
  a telephone tap has enabled them to understand that a recruiter , living at the other end of france , was about to smuggle her out . 
  camille , now aged 17 , was imprisoned in early january . 
  analysis of the girls ' phones offers an astonishing dive into a troubled world . 
  that of an adolescent without hope who is transcended by a mystical outcome . 
  in an exchange of sms messages with a friend , camille gives a brief summary of her life as she perceives it at 14 years - marriage , children , death - accelerated by the simplifying dynamics of jihadist thought : `` i 'll be married soon in turkey with my husband and will soon be a mother , inshallah , then we will raise our child who will be born in the sham , nothing more beautiful , and it will be a pious child , and then one day you 'll get a phone call telling you that i died in battle and that 's it , it 's simple . '', 
  * `` you should have seen him he was so handsome '' * if the pressures of life and death enter into in their conversations , the teenagers also have discussions that might seem age appropriate if they were against the backdrop of a civil war . 
  the new girlfriends of the route to radical islam are very interested in certain fighters known from social networks , as well as the brand of their shoes : camille : and uh ... 
  yesterday , you know , it was on facebook , and there i see what , i see a picture of a brother , you know , it was abu uh ... something guitone , you know him ? 
  fatima - abu what ? 
  i was too shocked i swear , this brother was too machallah [ as allah wills ] , i swear . 
  you should have seen him he was so handsome . 
  ( laughs ) fatima : - yeah ? 
  camille : - yeah , like , you know , on one of his pictures , you see , he had camo you see , camouflage , you know , military with air max ; the brother , he 's in the cham and he 's wandering around with air max . 
  fatima : - they have air max in cham ? 
  camille : - yeah , they have air max ; yeah , you know , when they leave , you see , they pack their suitcase . 
  and as usually , you know , they were all ex-delinquents , you see , they all wore air max . 
  so the shoes they have in general are air max , you know what i mean ?
