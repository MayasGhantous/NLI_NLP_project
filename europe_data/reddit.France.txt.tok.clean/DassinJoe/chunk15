  this fascination the girls have with jihadists has been turned into a recruiting tool by islamic state . 
  according to the latest figures from the interior ministry , some 867 teenagers have been identified in france for radicalization . 
  between october 2013 and october 2015 , the proportion of women among the french who went to syria increased from 12 % to 35 % ( 218 of 593 ) , while the flow of departures men changed slightly . 
  thirty-one percent of them are converts , compared to 23 % of men , and their radicalization process is significantly faster . 
  girls make up the majority ( 51 adolescents ) of the 84 french minors in syria . 
  often separated from their family or school , they are mostly motivated by humanitarian or religious considerations , particularly related to the headscarf . 
  their hijra ( `` emigration '' ) is sometimes controlled remotely by an older jihadist with whom they intend to achieve a precocious woman 's dream : starting a family . 
  past the territorial conquest phase , the islamic state has entered into a settlement logic and encourages unions to ensure the longevity of its project . 
  young converts , reputed to be more radical than the local women , are particularly popular with disaffected jihadists who spend most of their time on the internet when they are not at the front . 
  in a telephone tap , camille describes her online success with the men , `` yeah , and then after the brothers they added me [ on facebook ] , just to ask me if i would marry them and all , then voila . 
  then , they were kind , sometimes they were saying stuff like , advice , like , `` do not go to mosques in france , because the mosques in france , they teach the wrong islam ; the true islam is in the cham , and all , and we will teach you everything , do not worry my sister and all . '', 
  ( ... ) oh , i count most all marriage proposals i 've had . 
  ( ... ) if you are promised and everything , yeah i will end up polygamous with 50 husbands there ... '' ( laughs ) some online recruiters , like the correspondant who was behind the departure of l\u00e9a , `` abu saad al maghreb i '' - real name brahim el khayari - have made the recruitment of underage girls their specialty . 
  this jihadist , 22 , a native of nimes , exchanged simultaneously on facebook with l\u00e9a , camille and juliet , he has asked all three to marry him . 
  the first french jihadist to appear in an islamic state propaganda film , october 14 , 2014 , he spoke again recently in a video where he congratulated the attackers of 13 november 2015 . 
  is this jihadist commissioned by ei to recruit young women or is he inhabited by a deep sense of loneliness ? 
  in any case the young man shows himself to be very insistent , not hesitating to `` put pressure '' on them , as the teens told the police , when they explained to him they could n't join him quickly : `` come tomorrow , after it will be too late , the borders will close , you would be able to get through any more . '', 
  ** `` i want to do everything like merah '' ** asked about her possible terrorist plans , the girl described by social services as on the verge of anorexia , casually explains her fantasy : `` yes , yes , an attack like merah or blow everything up as a kamikaze . 
  do a shootout like he did , kill adults , especially against jews ( ... ) because i 've had enough being kept in france . 
  my project was more a gun attack than a kamikaze attack , it 's hard to find explosives in france even though i have never looked for them . 
  if it were easy , long ago that france would have been blown up . '', 
  `` what does mohamed merah represent for you ? '', 
  asked the interviewer . 
  `` i 'll give you an example , '' replies camille . 
  `` there are those who want to be just like the singer rihanna , and me , i want to be just like merah . '', 
  the name of the killer of toulouse and montauban returns in an obsessive way in this case . 
  juliette admits in custody that she cried the day he died . 
  the police officer asked her : `` did you cry for the jewish children or the soldiers who were killed by mohamed merah ? '', 
  `` no , '' replied camille . 
  latifa , who confesses to suicidal tendencies , admits her fascination with a phrase attributed to the author of the killings in march 2012 : `` i love death as you love life . '', 
  an exchange on facebook between camille and matthieu , a 16 year old convert who lives in the south of france , highlights how the jihadist ideology sublimates adolescent angst : `` do n't you want to feel what it 's like to blow up ? 
  lol [ laughing ] no lol ( ... ) but i do n't want to feel nothing i want to fight i 'd prefer to take a bullet yes you 're right its feels worse than blowing up suddenly i think lol lol i do n't want to blow up all of a sudden . 
  juliette spontaneously brings up her suicidal tendency to the police when it comes to explain her conversion to islam : `` quite simply it is this religion that saved me , because i wanted to commit suicide . '', 
  the girl , who wears a niqab with `` a veil over so we can not see [ her ] face at all , '' in the same context talks about her difficult childhood , her father 's departure , her education by her grandparents and an bunch of mean schoolgirls who have traumatized her ... 
  the old wounds that the promise of a better life after death seem to have cauterized . 
  `` the life of this world is a prison for the believer just as it is a paradise for those who do not believe . 
  in fact these people [ non-jihadist muslims ] cling to what is material . 
  i know that life in the hereafter will be better because it is written in the koran , '' she says in her interrogation . 
  `` i felt a malaise vis-\u00e0-vis christianity , including the fact that they consider jesus as god . 
  also i do not want to go to hell as the disbelievers do . '', 
  the police are probing her level of indoctrination and her relation to violence , have you ever seen live video of death or of decapitation on the internet ? 
  yes . 
  do you think it 's okay to kill people this way ? 
  i think that those who were killed must have deserved it . 
  to answer your question , for example if a person kills , violates or fails to respect the religion when we asked nicely . 
  have you ever watched scenes of decapitation ? 
  it 's not necessarily my cup of tea , but i am not shocked by these videos . 
  i saw the video of the american journalist who had his throat cut , but i found that it looked like a cartoon . 
  ( ... ) are you aware that these videos are real and are not derived from video games or movies ? 
  yes , i am aware . 
  during her hearing , camille does not conceal her ideological sympathies . 
  `` my parents are atheists . 
  i 'm salafi '' she sums up before the police . 
  `` we wo n't join any group , '' she continues confidently . 
  `` the free army of the levant is the right group for me [ a confusion between the free syrian army , a group of opponents of bashar al-assad , and his jihadist competitor , the islamic state in iraq and the levant , renamed the islamic state in june 2014 ] . 
  for me it is they who have the truth . '', 
  despite her geopolitical imprecisions , the police decided to place her under surveillance . 
  what they hear stuns them . 
  it is rare to implement such surveillance measures on minor girls . 
  even more unusual to hear teenagers proclaim that they want to `` kill for allah . '', 
  on august 14 , camille discusses with an girl unknown to antiterrorist services , fatima , 17 , enrolled in vocational school in a large city in central france . 
  the two teenagers , frustrated by not being able to go to syria , bring up a vague bombing project in which juliet is involved . 
  to believe their exchanges , this idea has been given to them by a certain vanessa , corresponding with them from syria via facebook . 
  born into a secular family of christian background , this young woman of 19 years is chasing the ghost of a father she never knew , a former un peacekeeper in bosnia . 
  she joined the syrian conflict in may 2014 , a month before l\u00e9a . 
  ** `` what 's a kamikaze ? 
  '' ** the terrorist project of the three teenagers expresses at the same time a focused anger on france and the jews , and morbid and suicidal tendencies . 
  it is unlikely , given the naivety that 's evident in their sms exchanges , that they would one day proceed with the act . 
  nevertheless , the violence of their thoughts is enough to illustrate the power of propaganda of is on fragile minds : camille : well i 'm going to blow myself up as a kamikaze in france if i can not leave . 
  fatima : - what 's a kamikaze ? 
  camille : - you blow yourself up with a bomb . 
  ( ... ) fatima : - where will you do that ? 
  if i 'm not able to leave i 'll do it with you . 
  ( ... ) camille : - we 're going to blow up the government boom boom boom !, 
  we are mujahida . 
  fatima - real mujahida hahaaa ( ... ) we 'll recite the shahada [ the muslim profession of faith ] , we 'll hold hands and blow up . 
  camille - yeah it 's best at the eiffel tower . 
  fatima : - yes , but there 'll be lots of muslim . 
  ( ... ) camille : - well we will target a jewish neighborhood . 
  fatima : - yes !, 
  in lyon there is a neighborhood that is jewish . 
  the project is far from complete . 
  but it arises insistently in their conversations . 
  camille goes on to propose using shotguns that her father keeps the family home . 
  the violently anti-semitic disucssions of the three girls and their apparent determination lead the police to intercept them on august 19th . 
  during her custody , camille does not shirk the questions of investigators : `` i do not think i 'm particularly extreme . 
  i believe that killing in the name of allah or dying as a martyr are normal acts for religion . '', 
  ** the `` flight '' of l\u00e9a ** l\u00e9a is 14 years old . 
  enrolled in a college in the paris region , she is quite a good student . 
  according to her friends , the girl , fragile and impressionable , is easily upset . 
  at home , islam is not very present . 
  her father , of algerian origin , is not practicing . 
  her mother , also born in algeria , does not wear the veil . 
  but for two years , l\u00e9a has been moving towards a literal reading of religion . 
  she insists , against the advice of her parents , on wearing the hijab . 
  this long veil that leaves the face visible , and this creates tension in the family . 
  on 18 june 2014 , the girl disappears . 
  at a time when her classmates are queueing for the canteen , lea takes the thalys ( train ) at 12:25 for amsterdam . 
  at 18:15 , she sends a last sms to her father and embarks on a flight to istanbul . 
  after ten hours of bus , a smuggler meets her at the turkish-syrian border and takes her to rakka , in northern syria , the self-proclaimed capital of is .
