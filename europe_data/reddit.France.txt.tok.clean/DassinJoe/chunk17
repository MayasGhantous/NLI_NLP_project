  i 'm well aware of the scams ; i was answering a question . 
   that , it 's a matter for the french police though , the uk can hardly react to it the uk is still at one end of the tunnel , even after brexit ...  it might , but that 'd slow through traffic . . 
  absent the single market , through traffic is going to be really slow anyway . 
  what security situation ? 
  people storming the ferries or sneaking into the tunnel ? 
  it has to be a shared issue . 
  it concerns the companies involved , france , and the uk . 
  the official passport control may move to britain , however . 
  no , but it 's generally not recognized as a religion . 
  the status varies from [ country to country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientology_status_by_country ) though . 
  in which case checking post brexit becomes eurostar 's problem . 
  it 's not campaigning . 
  it 's a politician being asked his opinion on what will happen in the event of a brexit . 
  let 's look at what macron really said :  `` the day this relationship unravels , migrants will no longer be in calais ... '' this may be considered scaremongering , but he 's certainly not saying that france will send migrants over . 
  he 's saying that the uk will control its border inside the uk , rather than in france as it currently does . 
  this is of course a possibility - why would france continue the le touquet agreement if britain leaves the eu ? 
  why would migrants queue up at calais if they know that they 'll get checked in the uk and deported from the uk ? 
   wo n't take long for train/ferry operators to enforce their own passport checking and cargo checking requirements before they let people use their services . 
  most successful illegal immigration to the uk happens through european ports that are not calais . 
  the people who end up in calais are the ones without any money to pay for a better route over to britain . 
   because where else would you go when you went onto the eurostar ? 
  but you 're correct in general . 
  there is ** british passport control ** at calais thanks to the le touquet agreement . 
  this is what macron is suggesting will end . 
  i flew from france to ireland and back again last week . 
  the official passport checking happened in the destination country after the flight landed . 
  there was a cursory glance at my passport prior to departure , but it was n't border control . 
  the poms . 
  i think it 's a reference to the [ monotonicity criterion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monotonicity_criterion ) . 
  he does n't look like a speed freak , but i guess you never can tell . 
  from my perspective , it was n't abolished because even though it 's faulty and undemocratic , it 's better to have a second chamber than to have nothing . 
  there are some likable individual senators who pointed out that abolishing the senate would give more scope to the elected lower house with less oversight of its activities . 
  going to hezbollah ? 
  funded by iran ? 
  and inevitably , this post has become about migrants . 
  smh . 
  there 's a video here : [ brexit debated ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/202a60c0-cfd8-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377.html ) where john redwood ( of the leave campaign ) states clearly that the uk will not pay anything to the eu . 
  this rules out eea at least according to john redwood . 
  [ here 's another description . 
  ] ( http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/about/seanad/ ) mostly it can delay legislation . 
  it can initiate legislation that does not have a financial impact ( so-called money bills ) . 
  it can make revisions to non-money bills . 
  it can make recommendations on money bills . 
  good points , but the person who opens the uk parliament has a uk title that includes the words `` defender of the faith '' . 
  iirc , this ironically was bestowed upon henry viii in his younger years for defense of catholicism . 
  nevertheless , the ` faith ' in question is clearly christianity . 
  [ tim severin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_severin ) recreated the 6th century [ voyage of st brendan ] ( http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/st-brendan-voyage.php ) in the 1970s , going from southern ireland to newfoundland in a currach ( 11 metres , wooden frame , leather clad , two-masted boat ) . 
  the [ irish senate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seanad_%c3%89ireann ) is a democratic mess in my opinion : * eleven members appointed by the prime minister * six members elected by graduates of some universities ( but not others ) * forty three members elected from five panels of nominees ( administrative , agricultural , cultural/educational , industrial/commercial , labour ) the 11 direct appointments are clearly political patronage . 
  the 43 members from the panels are also heavily subject to political patronage . 
  the university seats are elected quite openly , but it 's only for historical reasons that the electorate is some universities and not others . 
   the house of lords operates effectively as a technocratic chamber . 
  you mean the `` people 's peers '' appointed by the house of lords appointments commission ? 
  it 's a start , but they 're still less than 10 % of the chamber . 
  the rest are there from heritage , political patronage , etc. 
   the uk is ` technically ' a christian country your monarch is still head of the church of england , so i 'd say it 's a bit more than ` technically ' . 
  the headline that you posted yourself is :  french authorities begin clearance ** of part of ** calais ` jungle ' camp this means that some of the camp is being cleared . 
  the headline for the op is :  french authorities begin clearance ** of part of ** calais ` jungle ' camp it 's being cleared gradually . 
  there was a delay last week when it was discovered that there were more children in the camp than previously thought . 
  some of the camp has already been razed , but as noted already these operations take time . 
  cool . 
  i 'm sorry this happened to you . 
  bon courage . 
  interesting map but i have a very hard time visually distinguishing mixed ( leaning euroskeptic ) from mixed ( close to median ) . 
  contact the station information people and tell them you were assaulted . 
  ask whether they have cc recordings from the area of the incident . 
  if they do , contact the police and tell them of the incident . 
  this all assumes you 're willing to pursue this . 
  eh , it was your boy jean marie who failed to prove anything . 
  le monde and le canard enchain\u00e9 were foud to have been justified in their statements , iirc . 
  and nevertheless , in spite of all your assertions of ridiculousness , le pen 's legal proceedings against le monde ( and others ) failed . 
  it 's on his wikipedia page . 
  fairly simple rule : no foreign funding of centres of worship or imams . 
  religions get charitable status but their accounts must be published . 
  it may expose facebook to legal difficulties if they do n't crack down . 
  le pen carried ( and lost ) a hitler youth dagger in algiers in 1957 . 
  this is a matter of public record - the dagger was presented at the le monde trial when le pen sued unsuccessfully for defamation . 
  why would a frenchman carry a hitler youth dagger with his name engraved upon it , if he was n't an admirer of hitler and/or naziism ? 
  interestingly , jm le pen is the political heir of vichy france . 
  the lame ass anti-everything jokes write themselves . 
  it 's okay , they 've all sneaked into the uk . 
  one of those coincidences that make you wonder about the possibility of [ underlying designs ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/international/screen%20shot%202013-07-16%20at%2011.17.56%20am.png ) . 
  they 've been tapping undersea cable since the 1970s , so there are multiple ways to do it . 
  apparently the submarine uss jimmy carter was repurposed in 2005 to carry crew and equipment for deep sea tapping . 
  it 's more efficient at a landing point though . 
  edit : sorry did n't see unimatrix 's post re ivy bells . 
   avoid any espionage attempts by the us good luck with that . 
  as someone has already mentioned , it probably makes sense to do this anyway . 
  interesting . 
  in the video , john redwood ( mr spock ) states clearly that the uk wo n't pay anything to the eu , for example [ to join eea efta ] ( http://www.efta.int/eea/eu-programmes/application-finances/eea-efta-budget ) . 
  this is the first time i 've seen someone state this categorically . 
  if i understand correctly , this means that the brexit camp , at least the part that spock is involved with , plans either to default to wto rules or to negotiate a new agreement with the eu/eea . 
  this on top of negotiating agreements with the us and india and china . 
  that 's nice of finland . 
  having spent a winter in helsinki , i 'd imagine it 's tough on iraqis to adapt . 
  stupid kid . 
   prof stephen senn , an expert in statistical methods used in drug testing for the nhs and head of the luxembourg-based clinical and epidemiological investigation center , said the drug trial accident was `` extremely worrying '' . 
   he said hiding behind industrial secrets legislation was `` not acceptable '' . 
   ... we can not accept that it 's more important to keep industrial secrets than to avoid further serious problems for patients taking part in other clinical trials . 
  damn straight . 
  there are questions to answer here .
