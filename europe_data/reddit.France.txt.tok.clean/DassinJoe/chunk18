  he did n't get a visa . 
  there 's a show called the backyardigans that my kids used to love . 
  they saw it in the us when visiting my wife 's family . 
  the characters spoke english with north american accents . 
  some time later we visited england , and there was the backyardigans ( canadian production , i think ) dubbed into british english . 
  i was reacting to the specific language he cites :  `` one or more ( schengen ) member states consider you to be a threat to public policy , internal security , public health or the international relations of one or more of the member states '' . 
  to me this sounds like he 's on a list somewhere . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsnjtnub7c ), 
  and german tourists stopping off to buy cigarettes . 
  my guess is that he or someone with the same/a similar name is on the list of some country 's intelligence services . 
  there are lots of umair khans out there . 
  investigations are under way about who knew and failed to act . 
  yes . 
  i do n't see the print version much , but the online version is getting close to the mail with its levels of toxic celebrity obsession and sensationalism . 
  it 's a shame because the telegraph can be a real newspaper sometimes , e.g. 
  the mps ' expenses claims scandal some years back . 
  this is bizarre journalism . 
  headline : czech republic will leave along with britain 1st/2nd para : czech ** may choose ** to follow britain out 4th para : ** if britain leaves ** , we can ** expect debates ** about leaving the eu in a few years . 
  5th/6th para : actually it could cause major economic difficulties if czech were to leave . 
  we go from a clear statement of fact in the headline , to a conditional in the first and second paragraphs , to a second conditional and the possibility of ** debates ** in the fourth paragraph . 
  finally in the 5th/6th paragraph we have some reasoned analysis , which makes the earlier paragraphs very dubious . 
  poor show by bercow . 
  better yet , process economic migrants in their country of origin . 
  make it a clear and transparent process - people and skills get matched to job openings . 
  asylum seekers or refugees ** only ** can present themselves at designated processing centers at the eu borders . 
  if an application for asylum fails because , e.g. 
  someone proves to be an economic migrant , they ca n't reapply for a period of five or ten years . 
   amnesty also expressed alarm about fresh counter-terrorism laws being introduced across europe , in particular the `` rights-sapping '' state of emergency implemented in france they 're correct about that . 
  the state of emergency legislation is bullshit . 
  public demonstrations have been banned `` because they do n't want too many people gathering in a crowd '' , but popular sports games have been allowed to go ahead . 
  it 's entitled `` an atlas of prejudice '' so i would n't expect it to be 100 % accurate . 
  the [ website looks pretty cool ] ( https://www.atlasofprejudice.com/ ) . 
  the argument is the same as for irish - domhan is more likely to refer to the physical world , whereas saoghal primarily refers to life . 
  * cruinne * is closer to `` gathering '' i 'd expect . 
  you 're crazy . 
  what happens in countries where there is already a religious tax , like in germany ? 
  does some of this go to fund islamic centres of worship ? 
  really ? 
  in france ? 
  some background from wikipedia , as i thought i recognized the name but could n't remember the details :  hasaan mustafa osama nasr was a radical egyptian cleric and alleged member of al-gama ' a al-islamiyya who had fled egypt due to that group 's prosecution as a terrorist organization by the egyptian government . 
  he was granted political asylum in italy in 2001 , and held an italian asylum passport . 
   as early as spring 2002 , he was under investigation by italian and american intelligence agencies by means of wiretaps and physical and electronic surveillance . 
  italian authorities have claimed that they believed that they had evidence nasr was building a network to recruit terrorists , and possibly had links to al qaeda . 
  they alleged in particular links with ansar al-islam and ties to a network sending combatants in the iraqi kurdistan . 
  however , citing a book on al-qaeda by jason burke , a british reporter at the observer , la repubblica noted in june 2005 that in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq , the bush administration was claiming , along with british prime minister tony blair , that iraq maintained close links with al-qaeda , in particular through ansar al-islam . 
  the italian newspaper concluded that the abu omar case was a `` chapter in the combination of intelligence -- psychological warfare -- information war engaged by washington and london to justify the invasion of iraq . '', 
  there are also reports that nasr was involved in plotting a terrorist attack on the u.s. embassy in rome , and was suspected of being involved in a plot to bomb a number of children of foreign diplomats attending the american school of milan , although sources disagree whether such plots even existed . 
   most observers have come to believe that nasr was abducted by the united states as a source of intelligence on foreign combatants being recruited to fight in iraq , which , at the time , the united states had yet to invade . 
  she 's referred to as a minor in the story . 
  ^ ^ how ^ ^ many ^ ^ people ^ ^ read ^ ^ just ^ ^ the ^ ^ title ^ ^ and ^ ^ then ^ ^ comment ? 
  dw reports that more than 800 islamists left to join jihadi groups , ** and around a third ** have come back to germany . 
  that suggests 260 or so are back home . 
  other interesting data from a study of 677 islamists who went to syria up to june 2015 , more than 60 % were german citizens , and 17 % had converted to islam . 
  `` out of europe '' is used everywhere . 
  here 's that bastion of europhilia , the telegraph : [ nigel farage could consider quitting ukip to lead britain out of europe , says major ukip donor ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11904688/nigel-farage-could-consider-quitting-ukip-to-lead-britain-out-of-europe-says-major-ukip-donor.html ), 
   i 'm really fed up , get your shit together . 
  chin up , only another four months of this ... / jk, 
   once a guest has been booked , the questions are routinely loaded with unconscious europhile bias . 
   `` why do you think britain will be better off out of europe ? '' is a typical bbc starter for 10 for an interviewee supporting the vote to leave . 
  in fairness , if someone is challenging the status quo , the first question is `` why '' . 
  the web site seems [ reasonably balanced ] ( https://www.google.fr/webhp?hl=fr#hl=fr&amp;q=eurosceptic+site:bbc.co.uk ), 
  can manually browse the photos using this uri : http://calvertjournal.com/images/uploads/features/2016_feb/coming_of_age/transnistria/##_juliaautz_transnistrien.jpg where ## = 01 - 37, 
  if it 's a question of kids being sold , i 'd rather that it be investigated . 
  this just reloads the entire slideshow in the new tab for me . 
  no , i think s/he means [ these children ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/30/fears-for-missing-child-refugees ) . 
   at least 10,000 unaccompanied child refugees have disappeared after arriving in europe , according to the eu 's criminal intelligence agency . 
  many are feared to have fallen into the hands of organised trafficking syndicates . 
  very worrying . 
  some great photographs but i ca n't look at them properly in firefox or chrome . 
  they fill the screen and i ca n't scroll up or down for those in portrait mode . 
  yes , if you look at the image , that 's made quite clear . 
  the area speaking gaelic is in blue , but it should be domhan rather than saoghal . 
  though it gives `` warld '' rather than ` wuruld ' . 
  if you 're updating again at some point , scots gaelic would use [ ` domhan ' ] ( https://glosbe.com/gd/en/domhan ) as well . 
  [ yes it is . 
  i was joking tbh - i shop at m&s food whenever i can in paris , and as a previous poster mentioned , the curry is often excellent in the uk . 
  ireland sells more to the us ( 16 % of exports ) than to the uk ( 14 % ) . 
  benelux counts for 17.5 % and germany + france would be 14 % . 
  eu minus uk buys about 43 % of irish exports . 
  [ source ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irl/ ) i do n't expect the eu will erect trade barriers with the uk , but if it does , it wo n't be the catastrophe for ireland that some people are claiming it will be . 
  irish trade with the rest of the eu is 3 x more than its trade with the uk . 
  sideshow boris has n't changed my view of the uk . 
  i think brexit is a little more likely than it was on friday , but it will be a minor inconvenience to me if it happens , and i 'll have a couple of years to adjust . 
  my uk-based family will not be affected ( they 've been there for donkeys ' years ) , and my eu-based friends with uk origins probably wo n't be affected either . 
  i know some people who run cross-channel businesses and they might be impacted , but again they 'll have a couple of years to adapt . 
  visiting the uk already feels pretty exotic - i change currencies , i drive on the other side of the road , ~ ~ i find the local food inedible ~ ~ , etc. 
  whether it 's inside or outside the eu , this wo n't change . 
   but i 'll stick with my , not enough to read anything into yet point from earlier . 
  fair enough . 
  probably wise . 
  she 's of more use to european intelligence services in italy than in syria . 
  she could also be used for pro-western propaganda purposes if brought back . 
  hmm , the last time hsbc announced losses ( for 3q 15 ) there was little discernible impact on sterling . 
   trying to tie it specifically to an event is a bit premature . . 
  i do n't understand why ? 
  what else happened yesterday ? 
   unique position that a weaker pound = better for business for exporting but not importing there 's nothing unique about that . 
  it 's standard . 
  when my currency depreciates i can export more because i 'm relatively more competitive but imports become more expensive . 
  when my currency appreciates i can export less because i 'm relatively more expensive but imports become cheaper .
