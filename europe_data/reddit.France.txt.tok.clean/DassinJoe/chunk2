   `` my mum said : ` do n't go far , your dinner 's nearly ready , ' '' he recalled . 
  `` i said : ` i wo n't . ' ''  but they did . 
  they took the dart to d\u00fan laoghaire and snuck on to a ferry to holyhead . 
  emboldened by their success , they avoided the ticket checkers and got on the train to london . 
  eventually they wound up at heathrow airport . 
   they asked one passenger where his plane was going and on hearing that it was new york , they decided to take their chances . 
  telling anyone who asked that their parents were behind them , they passed the checkpoints and boarded the air india plane . 
   as if they were going to vote for it anyway yeah , why even bother with voting ? 
  crimeans . 
  or what 's left of them . 
   so let 's go on , what is going to be a next step after hyper ? 
  remember we are way beyond super and ultra . 
  is like mega over hyper or below ? 
  in taxonomic rank , the order is : ultra < super < hyper < grand * < mega < giga ^ ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ corollary ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ ^ irish ^ ^ ^ ^ person ^ ^ ^ ^ says ^ ^ ^ ^ things ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ `` grand '' , ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ means ^ ^ ^ ^ they 're ^ ^ ^ ^ supermegawesome !, 
   if she actually wants a brexit she does , but she wants the publicity more . 
  brexit is just a platform for her to draw attention to herself . 
  if she 's welcomed , she gets publicity ; if she 's opposed , she gets to play the victim and gets publicity . 
  she 's very talented at media manipulation . 
  does n't this simply hand the election to the green candidate in the second round ? 
  yeah , it 's really bizarre . 
  interesting article . 
  i think the author overstates the likelihood of the remaining eu countries `` punishing '' britain in the case of exit . 
  there may be some small amount of that , but i doubt it will be as serious as he predicts . 
  there are huge unknowns on both sides . 
  given that britain ca n't accept greater political integration , i think [ a two-speed europe is inevitable ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/welcome-to-a-two-speed-europe-deal-british-voters-brussels-open-marriage/ ) if britain remains . 
  this may be the most elegant solution in the long run , given current public attitudes towards the eu in several member states . 
  no it was n't . 
  a euro was 1.96 dm . 
  she polled third on the second round . 
  that 's the decisive one . 
  as a factual statement , she 's head of the third polling party in the most recent election . 
  [ third ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_regional_elections,_2015 ), 
  yes you 're right . 
  i just looked it up . 
  seems he won an appeal [ against the ban ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/geert-wilders-wins-appeal-ban-uk ) . 
  le pen wants to support vote leave but they do n't want anything to do with her . 
  however she 's an mep and head of the third best polling party in france , so the home secretary ca n't really ban her without provoking a big fuss . 
  how will she organise a rally in england if nobody wants to host her ? 
  or will britain first or some other borderline crowd invite her ? 
  i 'm guessing ukip wo n't . 
   being that i 'm german-american , i 'm rather familiar with german law . . how much of this law dates from the post-wwii period ? 
  and how much input did the u.s. have at the time ? 
   shit like wesboro ? 
  are you saying the government should have intervened ? 
  no , i 'm saying that 's the price of the u.s. position . 
  i can openly support hitler and his policies in the u.s. , so long as i do n't call for imminent slaughter . 
  are you surprised that this is not the case in germany ? 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm pro freedom of speech , but i recognise that it 's not the panacea some people believe it to be . 
  the standard the u.s. applies in such cases is [ `` imminent lawless action '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/imminent_lawless_action ) . 
  hate speech is tolerated so long as it does not include immediate incitement to violence . 
  is this more admirable than germany 's approach ? 
  yes in theory , but in practice it leads to shit like the westboro baptists and the klan . 
  meanwhile the first amendment did n't prevent mccarthyism or limit j. edgar hoover in his targeting of civil rights groups . 
  gurkhas are nepalese . 
  they 're not sikhs . 
  i 've always thought sikhs are well-regarded around the world . 
   this self-victimization complex is destroying this sub . 
  yes it 's really tedious . 
  people do n't discuss things they just wail about being labelled . 
  humble pie is british ( made from deer offal ) and eating crow is from the us . 
  two countries separated by a common language . 
  it 's an american version of `` eat humble pie '' . 
  crows are carrion birds and are thought unfit for human consumption , so eating crow would be doing something distasteful . 
  it had been moving the other direction , which is why i remarked on it . 
  i would n't put too much faith in bookies ' odds - they got the last uk ge wrong , for instance - but watching the direction can be a good indication of popular sentiment . 
  as to the depth of the market , i 've no idea . 
  at this point if santa claus came out in favour of britain remaing in the eu , certain members of the uk population would be calling for him to be jailed for multiple counts of trespass on the night of december 24th . 
  they 'll calm down in late june . 
  lol . 
  this is just an article in an english language publication - thelocal publishes editions in france , spain , sweden , denmark and probably other countries as well . 
  brexit is a perfect topic for them because their focus is english speaking ex-pats . 
  edit : for what it 's worth , the ladbrokes price on leave suggests that campaign is losing a little ground . 
  they had leave at a 35 % probability 10 days ago ; down to 33 % today . 
  to get an idea of the impact of [ don quixote ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_works_influenced_by_don_quixote ) . 
  it 's an amazing piece of literature . 
  quite clear who killed him so . 
  anglo-saxon is a very bizarre categorisation : modern english probably owes as much to french as it does to germanic languages . 
  in any case , irish people do n't consider themselves anglo-saxon , even if the judicial systems are similar . 
  i 'm not getting into a ranking of atrocities . 
  i will just note that le pen considers the systematic , industrialised execution of a group of six million people , solely on the basis of ethnicity/religion , to be a `` detail of history '' . 
  fuck him . 
  people like le pen deny or downplay the holocaust to send a signal to their supporters . 
  this signal is basically pure anti-semitism . 
  the underlying narrative is that killing jews is somehow desirable . 
  should le pen be punished for this ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  he should definitely be challenged over it because it 's bullshit . 
  the french legal system disagrees with you . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-marie_le_pen he supported the rehabilitation of collaborators . 
  he 's repeatedly denied the holocaust . 
  he 's openly anti-semitic . 
  read about her father 's political career . 
  plenty of stuff on wikipedia . 
  i did n't say mlp is a nazi , just that she 's happy to keep her fathers ' supporters . 
  because she 's happy to carry the mantle of her father , who as pointed out , is literally a nazi cunt . 
  if she was serious about reform , she 'd rename the fn and kick out the racists . 
  but she wants to keep the old core support of her father 's party , while attracting various other groups - economic protectionists , anti-eu , law & order , etc. 
   jury duty is actually compulsory only in the anglo-saxon countries ^ and ^ in ^ ireland . 
  but fair enough point thanks .
