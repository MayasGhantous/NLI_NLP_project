  ah , terry wogan was narrating that one ... died a couple of weeks back :-(, 
  well , in fairness it 's ~ ~ montueswednes ~ ~ thursday !, 
   or you worry about the axis of power moving eastwards , away from the atlantic , as happened already with the eurovision . 
   in previous years the results of the professional juries and viewers have been presented as a combined result , each accounting for 50 percent of the final score . 
  from 2016 , the professional juries and televoters from each country will each award a separate set of points from 1 to 8 , 10 and 12 . 
  this now means the top 10 countries in both the jury and televote will receive points , adding a new level of excitement for hundreds of millions of viewers in europe and beyond . 
  some hyperbole , but if eurovision excites you , get ready to have your world rocked ... 
  too potentially confusing - could mean people who like europe but do n't necessarily like the eu , or people who like the euro currency . 
  hence i went for eu-ophile , clumsy though it is . 
   a brexit has never been about isolation , i wish this meme would die . 
  it 's a casual reference back to british foreign policy in the late 19th century . 
  do n't take it too seriously . 
  i certainly do n't intend it to shame anyone . 
  remind me to show you my collection of official journals sometime ... 
  edit 2 : it 's remain minus leave . 
  there 's another option which is `` does n't matter '' . 
  ~ ~ all ~ ~ ~ ~ score ~ ~ ~ ~ below ~ ~ ~ ~ 50 % ~ ~ ~ ~ remain ~ ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~ ~ leave . ~ ~ ~ ~ i.e. ~ ~ ~ ~ in ~ ~ ~ ~ france ~ ~ ~ ~ 18 % ~ ~ ~ ~ want ~ ~ ~ ~ britain ~ ~ ~ ~ to ~ ~ ~ ~ leave , ~ ~ ~ ~ but ~ ~ ~ ~ 82 % ~ ~ ~ ~ want ~ ~ ~ ~ britain ~ ~ ~ ~ to ~ ~ ~ ~ stay , ~ ~ ~ ~ resulting ~ ~ ~ ~ in ~ ~ ~ ~ a ~ ~ ~ ~ 32 % ~ ~ ~ ~ net ~ ~ ~ ~ remain . ~ ~ see below . 
  `` net remain '' is `` remain minus leave '' . 
  it 's going to take time to assess how britain is doing though . 
  if i understand correctly , a vote to leave will be followed by a period of at least two years while the conditions of withdrawal and subsequent terms of trade are worked out . 
  then there 'd be a couple of years to assess how britain is faring in its ` splendid isolation ' . 
  i agree that a british exit might result in some significant reform . 
  yes , that 's a good point . 
  if you 're an eu-ophile you definitely want them in . 
  i 'm not sure there was ever that much outrage . 
  one guy on twitter was quoted in the article . 
  plus there was a predictable soundbite from a group called `` hope not hate '' . 
  these articles write themselves to a large extent - someone publishes something controversial , search twitter for someone who reacts strongly , phone or e-mail an advocacy group for a soundbite . 
  job done and retire to the pub . 
  i guess there are a number of issues at play . 
  i 'll probably prefer britain stays in eu if : * i have family who live there * i plan to work there myself some day * i have other economic ties ( export/import ) * i 'm an anglophile or brito-phile i 'll probably prefer britain leaves the eu if : * i want my country to leave the eu * i can see a way to profit personally from brexit * i do n't like britain for some reason, 
  lol . 
  you might want to look up ad hominem kid . 
  edit - [ better pic of context ] ( http://imgur.com/cbd9qqd ), 
  tu m ` as donn\u00e9 des exemples ? 
  europa was phoenician , from the city of tyre in modern day lebanon . 
  as others have noted she was raped by zeus who disguised himself as a bull and carried her off to crete . 
  making her an illegal immigrant , albeit against her will . 
  the abduction has been the subject of numerous artistic portrayals : [ titian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rape_of_europa_%28titian%29#/media/file:tizian_085.jpg ) , [ paolo veronese ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:paolo_veronese_-_the_rape_of_europa_-_google_art_project.jpg ) , [ jean-francois de troy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28mythology%29#/media/file:the_abduction_of_europa,_jean-fran%c3%a7ois_de_troy.jpg ) , [ francois boucher ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:fran%c3%a7ois_boucher_-_the_rape_of_europa_-_wga2898.jpg ) , [ auguste janniot ] ( http://www.primaveragallery.com/sculpture/janniot-rape-of-europa ) , [ martin de vos ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:martin_de_vos_-_the_rape_of_europa_-_google_art_project.jpg ) , [ fernando botero ] ( http://sculptsite.com/archive/images/fb-rape-of-europa4.jpg ) , [ georg wrba ] ( http://www.allposters.com/-sp/the-rape-of-europa-sculpture-by-georg-wrba-1872-1939-1920s-posters_i9847343_.htm ) . 
  edit , and i forgot [ rembrandt !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_abduction_of_europa_%28rembrandt%29 ), 
   should be interesting to see if her case is used to get him off . 
  i do n't think it can be . 
  in the interview that was posted yesterday she said she did n't use the hashtag . 
  also the charges were dropped before she appeared in court . 
  yes , this latest statement is consistent from him . 
  claiming that it 's a surprise for merkel is disingenuous , imo . 
  interesting , any particular reason why it would be ? 
   there are entire territories over which the french government has lost all control . 
  can you name them ? 
  even one ? 
  there were two non-eu suicide bombers at stade de france . 
  i think they both entered europe on syrian passports . 
  some of the other attackers may also have taken advantage of the chaos , though as they already had eu passports it might not have made much difference for them . 
  there were concerns about [ islamists last year in bremen ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-iduskbn0lw0dw20150301 ) as well . 
   for the lazy . 
  not enough . 
  do you mind phoning me and reading the article to me ? 
   if what you claim were true , most gun supporters would be paranoid and illogical people that base their defense on some abstract fear of hypotheticals . 
  i 'm saying that people who want guns to be available to everyone are afraid of some possible attack . 
   the crux of the matter is self defense . 
   people want a feeling of safety or having a chance if some sort of attack were to happen . 
  you 're saying the same thing as me . 
  think about what you wrote . 
  you 're supporting my argument . 
  but hey , i know lots of gun owners . 
  i grew up in a family of hunters . 
  i live in a rural area with lots of forest . 
  i even learned to shoot rifles some years back but i do n't keep a gun myself . 
  my extended family in the us includes even more hunters . 
  i have no problem with properly regulated gun ownership . 
  i have a serious problem with the idea that * until nobody has guns , everybody must have guns * , which is what the guy said , which is what i commented on , which is what you responded to . 
  greater levels of gun ownership are not a panacea for the dangers inherent in living in society . 
   europeans are gutless cowards . 
  writes the heroic warrior behind the keyboard . 
   is that the only means of defense that society is going to allow her ? 
  what 's the solution ? 
  women under a certain height and weight are allowed to carry guns ? 
  no , the solution according to you and jesse hughes is that everyone has a gun . 
  therefore the rapist has a gun because he knew before he went out that night that he was going to rape someone . 
  the woman may or may not have brought her gun with her . 
  again , the problem is proliferation . 
  making guns more easily available does n't solve the problem . 
  if access to guns prevents or deters rape , we should expect there to be fewer rapes in the us than in countries with stricter gun control , should n't we ? 
  but the comparative statistics indicate that the us is ranked as high as or higher than the vast majority of european countries : [ 1 ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/rape-rate ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.wonderslist.com/top-10-countries-with-maximum-rape-crimes/ ) . 
  you said earlier that * the numbers of gun-related deaths and injuries are statistically insignificant * . 
  i 've spent several years studying statistics , but i 'm not certain i understand what you mean . 
  in longitudinal studies there 's a very clear and statistically significant correlation between access to guns and homicides/injuries from guns . 
  [ places with more guns have more homicides ] ( http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/gun-homicide-effect-increase ) . 
  individuals with guns in the home are more likely to be killed with guns [ 1 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12764330 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full ) . 
  fair enough , my mistake . 
   the argument revolves around self defense and evening the playing field , no , the argument revolves around imagining something that did n't happen . 
  jesse hughes thinks that if france had more liberal gun laws , the loss of life would have been less . 
  this assumes : * multiple people would have brought their guns to the concert * these people would have been effective enough to shoot someone firing an akm assault rifle * shooting the attackers would not have detonated their suicide vests people who are n't fearful do n't carry guns in their day to day lives . 
  look at the aurora shootings in colorado some years back . 
  similar situation but with fairly liberal gun control laws ( i assume ) . 
  the killer walked out of the building unchallenged . 
  i wo n't provide a moral justification for a terrorist act . 
  i 'm also unable to effectively argue a counter-factual . 
  what weapon do you expect someone to bring to a concert ?
