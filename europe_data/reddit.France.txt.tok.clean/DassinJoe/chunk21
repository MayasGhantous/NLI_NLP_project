  fully automatic weapons are illegal for civilians in france , but handguns and semi-automatics are not . 
  you need a permit to buy a handgun here , but i think this is true for at least some of the us too . 
  jesse hughes and you are assuming that easier access to guns would have `` solved '' the situation in the bataclan , but this is an ex post facto argument . 
  if people were n't afraid of being attacked at the bataclan , they might have left their guns at home . 
  why would you carry a weapon to a concert for goodness sake , unless you are already scared ? 
  here 's my bottom line : terrorists do not change our behaviour , whether that be by making us scared to have a drink on the terrace of a bar , or scaring us into carrying weapons . 
   you need to go back and read the article again no i do n't . 
  he said this : * maybe until nobody has guns everybody has to have them * but the fact is that i can make molotov cocktails very easily and i could carry one with me wherever i go . 
  does that mean that everyone should carry a molotov cocktail at all times ? 
  i can buy a hunting knife very easily ; should everyone carry a hunting knife ? 
  there 's a certain level of risk inherent to life , but i do n't see the point in adding to that by mass weaponizing . 
  i understand the self-protection arguments , but the number of gun-related deaths and injuries in the us are more worrisome to me than the possibility of being shot by a terrorist in paris . 
   the swiss will decide whether to ... legalize the `` rigorous expulsion '' of foreigners who commit two offenses within a 10-year period without a trial or appeal . 
   the blanket rule would apply to grave crimes like murder and rape as well as ** lesser infractions like arguing with a police officer . 
  ** wow . 
  that 's pretty fucked up . 
   research has shown that 9/10 britons will never own a home this compares to 2001 when 69 % owned their own home . 
  note that the 9/10 is people on low to middle income , whereas the 69 % is likely across all incomes . 
  could n't we make the same argument for any illegal weapons ? 
  until nobody has flamethrowers , everybody has to have them . 
  until nobody has shoulder-launched multipurpose assault weapons , everybody has to have them . 
  and how do you feel about your politicians ? 
  [ ] bah , shower of wastrels !, 
  [ ] could do better . 
  [ ] they 're fine , please get out of the way of the sun . 
  [ jerky house ] ( http://www.jerky-house.com/ ) seems to be jack link 's and covers much of europe . 
  no idea as to the quality . 
  one of the pop/folk bands wrote a song for him when he first got elected to parliament : [ michael d rockin ' in the d\u00e1il ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyg2ix0ody0 ) he 's one of the few genuinely decent politicians . 
  more accurately , belgium has the highest per capita rate of participants for a * western * nation . 
  there are more fighters per capita from bosnia-herzogovina and kosovo , [ for example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o7aqrsv.jpeg ) . 
  poll finds that british public is in a grumpy mood and will probably remain so until the weather gets better . 
   yeah but in france & germany & poland they managed to rally a sizable part of the right wing if i remember correctly , pegida stayed out of poland to avoid offending the local hooligans . 
  yes , but it 's an instance of a decorated helmet associated with a viking story . 
  it will be entertaining , but i 'm not certain either salmond or farage could convince fence-sitters one way or another . 
  completely arbitrary : half the stories on the front page of this sub are `` local news '' . 
  here 's [ a graphic ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/images/2016/02/15/5546847_paris-infog.jpg ) ( in french ) that summarizes the change . 
  hidalgo 's goal is to have municipal authorities for more equivalent-sized groups of people . 
  currently the 1st arrondissement has less than 1/10th the number of people as the 19th . 
  you 're right - wagner 's costume designer , professor carl emil doepler , provided horned helmets for an 1876 production of [ der ring des nibelungen ] ( http://www.scribd.com/doc/51267328/frank-invention-of-horned-helmet ) . 
  the messenger in [ this 1857 painting by august malmstr\u00f6m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august_malmstr%c3%b6m#/media/file:konung_ellas_s%c3%a4ndebud_inf%c3%b6r_ragnar_ladbroks_s%c3%b6ner_%281857%29_av_august_malmstr%c3%b6m.jpg ) appears to be wearing some sort of decorated helmet , though i wonder if that 's just a reference to hermes . 
   as for looking arab , meh , you 'll most likely be confused for southern european exactly . 
  there 's a ` mediterranean ' appearance that lots of southern europeans share . 
  dark eyes , dark hair , olive skin . 
  they look like a motorcycle gang . 
  here 's something i learned recently : there 's no evidence that vikings wore horned helmets . 
  only one complete viking helmet has been found , this was found at a farm called gjermundbu in ringerike in central norway . 
  here 's [ a picture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:vikinghjelm,_gjermundbu.jpg ) . 
  the traditional horned ` viking ' helmet that we know is a product of 19th century imagination . 
  fjords and parrots with beautiful plumage . 
  yes ` glen ' is widely used in ireland and scotland , perhaps more used than ` valley ' . 
  the brits do n't like being told what to do unless your family name is windsor . 
  the article does n't make it sound like simply obama 's opinion . 
  it sounds very active : `` intervention '' , `` reach out '' , `` fears cameron could lose '' . 
  this is not the same as china or japan saying `` we 'd prefer it if britain stayed in '' . 
  it sounds more bombastic , more like meddling . 
  i 'm pro britain remaining , but i can still see that this is a bad idea . 
  i never said the us is less stable than the eu , i merely pointed out that the us may have a whole new bunch of problems come the election . 
  but you guys are right . 
  obama should tell the brits how to vote . 
  the senate guy should diagnose all of europe 's problems and tell us what we 're doing wrong . 
  that 'll fix everything . 
   corker , saying america 's problems pale in comparison with the eu :-) let 's see how the presidential election pans out ... 
  bloody wonderful project !, 
  how do you establish age , e.g. 
  between 16 and 24 for men ? 
  edit : nevermind - i see you 've answered below re x-rays . 
   i really do n't get where your not thinking its a big deal . 
  from the ipsos/economist poll i linked to in the first post . 
  about 15 % of people surveyed think it 's ** the most ** or ** another ** important issue facing britain today . 
  people will become more interested closer to june , but this february it 's not ranking very high on most peoples ' agendas . 
  i grew up in ireland speaking both english and irish i look on every political issue as a languages thing ;-) ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ half ^ ^ ^ ^ joking, 
  well here 's my understanding but i could be mistaken : the basques and catalonians favoured carlist traditionalism because it gave them regional autonomy within spain . 
  they clearly were n't going to get any autonomy under franco , so after some prevarication the pnv sided with the republicans . 
  this lasted until the basque nationalists were forced out the basque country by franco 's forces in 1937 . 
  catalonia held out until the bitter end and was treated particularly badly by franco as a result . 
  it does n't surprise me that franco 's rule suited the upper classes . 
  franco promoted castillian as the only official language of spain . 
  other languages were not taught and were either banned or discouraged . 
  both catalonia and the basque country had greater autonomy and cultural freedom before franco . 
  people in those areas do not remember him fondly . 
  that only took what , seven years ? 
  he might see jail time in another two or three . 
  people who are asked their opinion on brexit are divided . 
  this is not the same thing as it being a hot topic . 
  people are more concerned about immigrants , the nhs , and the economy . 
  clearly ` immigrants ' has some relationship to brexit , but it 's a broader subject than that . 
  the writer is trying to position brexit as a major topic of interest , but the date has n't even been set yet !, 
  june is looking likely . 
   the spanish people approved of franco passively or actively do n't think many basques and catalonians approved either passively or actively . 
  leave some of them perhaps , but a long dictatorship that depended on a ` cult of personality ' leaves way too much material representing the dead dictator . 
  franco 's image permeated spanish life for decades , through statues , posters , paintings etc. 
  there 's no reason to keep all of it now , particularly as the quality of some of the ` art ' depicting him is questionable . 
  her wikipedia page provides a few lols : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louise_mensch  in august 2015 , the former mp tweeted a screenshot suggesting that antisemitic searches were being made by jeremy corbyn supporters to purposefully trigger offensive auto-complete suggestions for her twitter account . 
  other users quickly pointed out that her screenshot was actually of her own search history . 
  mensch denied attempting to smear the corbyn campaign . 
   valentine 's day is the traditional feast of love . 
  but this february , britons are more fixated on a political divorce . 
  [ eh no ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/images/polls/eutrendjan16.jpg ) . 
  it 's rising in importance but it 's still a minority interest . 
  these guys are murderous cowardly scum .
