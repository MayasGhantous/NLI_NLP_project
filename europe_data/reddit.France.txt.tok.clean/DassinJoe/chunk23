  before denouncing the `` political cowardice of those who watch this ascension '' without reacting . 
  ** what is your view of the sexual assaults of 31 december and the reaction of the german authorities ? 
  ** they occurred in ten cities in five countries simultaneously , suggesting a form of coordination . 
  feminists have criticized their deliberate concealment by european governments - and the media . 
  the left has denounced the use of these events by the racist xenophobic extreme right , which blames anyone `` foreign '' : migrant , immigrant , asylum seeker and citizens whose foreign origin dates back generations . 
  i agree with these protests , but there is an element sorely lacking : the denunciation of islamic fundamentalism as the new far-right force . 
  a major problem is the mortal inability of the european left to support the rights of women against any aggression , whatever the aggressor , to oppose racist attacks of the traditional extreme right , and simultaneously to denounce the fundamentalist far right . 
  this stems from the inability of the left to reformulate the theory of the `` principal enemy '' - us imperialism ; a reformulation that is needed as we face the risk of being overwhelmed by the `` secondary enemy '' - armed fundamentalism . 
  the result is a scandalous hierarchy of rights , where those of women are placed at the bottom of the ladder , after the rights of minorities , religious or cultural rights . 
  ** we feel a real sense of urgency in your discourse ... ** yes !, 
  it is urgent that the left finally hears us , before the clash between xenophobic extreme right and extreme muslim fundamentalist right becomes unmanageable in europe , and before in our country , resistance to fundamentalism is completely extinguished in blood . 
  we see in europe the signs of the rise of the fundamentalist far right that we have already experienced in our country . 
  since the 1990s , when the fundamentalist armed groups occupied territories in algeria and imposed their laws there , the algerian feminists have continued to inform the european left , european media and international human rights groups about crimes against women . 
  without receiving their support . 
  all that the press pretends to discover in the middle east today has been tested in the algerian fundamentalist laboratory : women were kidnapped there , reduced to domestic and sexual slavery , forcibly impregnated to produce `` good muslims '' ; the recalcitrant were burned , tortured , mutilated , decapitated , their heads paraded in public parade . 
  the list of victims shows a huge percentage of women among those killed , and some women were specially targeted professions ( hairdressers , beauticians ) . 
  the link should be made between attacks against women in algeria , tunisia , egypt , mali and the attacks that just happened in europe . 
  although the scale of events is in no way comparable , we must recognize it as a harbinger of the fundamentalist rise . 
  ( co n't ), 
  in the context , i do n't see any other way to interpret it . 
  the journalist for * marianne * asserts that el-farssaoui was an informant . 
  as noted earlier , there 's no proof of this offered . 
   there is nothing in this article that says abdelkader el-farssaoui was a part of the secret service or even their informant . 
  no , there is a clear statement that he was an informant for belgian investigators , but there 's no evidence offered to substantiate it :  abou jaber serait un indic des enqu\u00eateurs belges , apr\u00e8s l'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 de la police espagnole ... 
  in the late 1970s , serge gainsbourg made a reggae-inspired album called [ aux armes et c\u00e6tera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aux_armes_et_c%c3%a6tera_%28album%29 ) , including [ his version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlq7ecvraf0 ) of la marseillaise . 
  yes there are . 
  sometimes they are placed separately from the french description . 
   dans ce pays-ci [ that 'd be britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_minorca_%281756%29 ) . 
  i expect it 's more of a fishing expedition - if they stop someone they recognise , they 'll search the vehicle . 
  meteorites used to freak people out big time . 
  how do you explain a fireball flying through the sky and an enormous explosion when it hits earth ? 
  here 's an article that was published after the russian meteorite a few years back : [ thunderstone : what people thought about meteorites before modern astronomy ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/thunderstone-what-people-thought-about-meteorites-before-modern-astronomy/273220/ ) ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ link ^ ^ ^ format, 
  exactly - her description is :  ` my piece to camera was chaotic , people showing middle fingers , a man who was having fun miming a sex act behind me and above all the hand placed on my breast . ' from [ here ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/05/reporter-sexually-assaulted-live-on-tv-5664438/#ixzz3zjojqkdc ), 
  and all this at a time when german workers are seeing the [ best real wage increases in decades ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germans-enjoy-highest-real-wage-rise-in-decades/a-19026620 ) ( linked by op yesterday ) . 
  imagine where her ratings would be if workers were doing badly ... 
  if merkel does n't get a handle on the refugee/immigrant situation her political career will end sooner rather than later . 
  merkel has gone from 75 % approval last april to 46 % approval . 
  the big winners are the afd , founded only 3 years ago and now polling over 10 % and probably around 12 % . 
  i read that one of the guys was her ` boyfriend ' so she may have thought she 'd had sex with him . 
  what a pos to hand his girlfriend over to a group of rapists . 
  how terrible . 
  a kidnap/ransom plan gone wrong ? 
  i wish my company would employ a few of them as salespeople . 
  this seems to targeted at `` key workers '' such as nurses , garda\u00ed , and i 'd presume fire officers . 
  there 's been a similar scheme in london for some time . 
  the effect on the dublin rental market will depend on the size of this key worker population . 
  unfortunately the article is thin on detail . 
  france has been promoting a third child policy for over 10 years with reasonable progress . 
  the [ biggest upticks ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=fr&amp;v=31 ) have been after the government announces monetary incentives or additional support for working mothers . 
  wow , til !, 
   though the children would be raised as muslims . 
  that 's a deal breaker for observant catholics , as they 'd insist the kids be raised in the catholic church . 
   `` i felt so disappointed , they 'd tricked me . 
  i was seeking help , why did they do this to me ? 
  they treated me like a fool , '' said mohamed . 
  no , they did n't . 
  they simply enforced the regulations as they exist and as they existed before you began your journey . 
  the regulations may be problematic , but it was up to mohamed to learn about them before he abandoned his wife and children in iraq . 
   there is no `` abusing '' of an `` unconditional '' income ... perhaps not at an individual level , but in the aggregate one third of swiss people fear that people will stop working . 
   only two percent would stop working , while eight percent said they could envisage this possibility depending on circumstances . 
  ...  however , a third of the 1,076 people interviewed for the survey by the demoscope institute believed that `` others would stop working '' . 
  people never disappoint :-) maybe the way to do it is to introduce it on a provisional basis , to be cancelled if it 's abused . 
  i agree and we should beware of zealots of any stripe , especially ones who have recently converted . 
  is this the guy whose global `` intelligence '' and `` security '' company got hacked by anonymous and a bunch of its e-mails sent to wikileaks ? 
  at gare du nord in paris there 's a group of young roma women who beg discretely . 
  they 'll approach travelers and ask , in english , `` do you speak english ? '', 
  if you say ` yes ' , they 'll spin you a story about needing money . 
  their main target seems to be eurostar passangers or other english-speaking tourists . 
  the train station staff make them leave every so often , but they just drift back in . 
  this has been going on for 10 years at least . 
   following her conviction , her father , mohammed shakil , claimed she would appeal against her conviction . 
  he told itv news : `` it was a mistake ... [ she is ] the perfect daughter , the daughter who never went out nightclubbing and never went out doing this or going there ... d'you know , i think she might 've been better off going clubbing occasionally . 
  odds from ladbrokes have moved in the last 10 days : remain was 2/5 now 4/11 leave was 15/8 now 2/1 it 's early days , though , and the bookies did a bad job of predicting the last uk general election . 
   in an article from last february , valizadeh , advocated making rape legal on private property . 
  his rationale was that a women who consented to go into a man 's house , had consented to sex . 
  and if he consents to go to a guy 's house , the bloke can rape him ? 
  why stop at rape ? 
  if someone consents to come to my house , they 've consented to being beaten and tattooed . 
  here 's the guy 's [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirsad_bekta%c5%a1evi%c4%87 ) . 
  he was going to blow himself up to attack an embassy in bosnia . 
  sounds like he was on his way to join isis this time - he flew from sweden to greece ten days ago . 
  sounds like the mail is trying to avoid risks of libel tourism . 
   is there a background for that ? 
  prior to 1962 , commonwealth citizens could settle in britain . 
  after ' 62 , it became more difficult , with restrictions on the number of non british citizens allowed in per year . 
  it was still easier for people from commonwealth countries to get study or work visas in britain than for people from non commonwealth countries . 
  i do n't think either somalia or iraq were ever in the commonwealth though . 
  groups like ukip complain more about europeans from the accession states because they 're more numerous than somalis or iraqis and because their numbers ca n't be controlled as easily . 
  the uk government can cap asylum seeker numbers but it ca n't cap the number of polish workers ( assuming they can get jobs or otherwise support themselves ) . 
  in the 1970s , pakistan was a closer ally to britain than hungary . 
  her unfortunate child . 
  hopefully she has some sane relatives who can look adopt him . 
  i do n't care much about adults going to syria to join isis , so long as they stay there ( and die there ) , but i hate it when they bring young kids with them . 
  nope . 
  i love how two people can just share a keyboard like they might a piano ... 
   they have a 75-year immunity on all the documents that 's what i was referring to . 
  it 's a ` failure to release in a timely manner ' . 
  it seems very suspicious to me . 
  if he was simply transporting his guns because he had nowhere else to store them ( already hard to believe ) , why would she vanish ? 
  le figaro is reporting she was [ arrested overnight ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2016/01/29/97001-20160129filwww00055-disneyland-paris-la-femme-recherchee-a-ete-arretee.php ) .
