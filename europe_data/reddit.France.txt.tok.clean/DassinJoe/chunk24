  this seems more recent than the report about the woman who was released . 
  my impression is the sexual assault and the mugging went hand in hand . 
  if you want to steal from someone , touching them sexually is a good way to distract them while you ( or an accomplice ) steal their phone/purse/bag . 
  many of the reports are along the lines of `` he touched me between the legs/grabbed my breasts , then took my belongings '' . 
   former republican prisoner dixie elliot put the question plainly on monday : `` were the brits running both sides ? '' ...  former police ombudsman nuala o\u2019loan told the programme the state agencies had `` operated outside the rules . 
  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people died because those people . 
  were not stopped in their tracks . '', 
  we 're left wondering if the british government ever had any coherent strategy in ni . 
  of course the failure to release government papers in a timely manner makes it impossible to establish how much key individuals knew . 
  both fit the geometric definition of ` pyramid ' ( a solid having a polygonal base , and triangular sides that meet in a point ) . 
  some updates : the woman accompanying him has been located and arrested at her home . 
  it was a metal detector he set off at the entrance to the hotel new york ( i 'd understood an x-ray found the guns ) . 
  he says he 's moving home and left his belongings with his mother , except the guns because she did n't want the guns in her home . 
  he admits to buying the guns illegally `` to protect himself '' . 
  the charge is `` possession of illegal weapons '' for the moment . 
  some questions spring to mind : * why did the woman who was with him skedaddle ? 
  * how stupid is he trying to take two guns through a metal detector ? 
  * how stupid is he wandering around with guns in the paris area these days ? 
  * what 's the deal with the koran in his baggage ? 
   she speaks of a schematic image in which women are either saints or whores , in which there is no room for self-determined women . 
  the madonna/whore dichotomy . 
  was common among catholics for a long time . 
   these were organised and planned assaults . 
  yes , and organised and planned muggings . 
  i 've read reports of some older guys with phones directing `` operations '' . 
  this is n't just about sexual assault and frustrated immigrants - there 's a criminal ( mass theft ) element to it as well . 
   police found 9mm bullet casings but despite sending in scores of ant-riot officers overnight , no weapons . 
  fuck that . 
  they should keep tossing the place until the guns are found . 
  his bag was x-rayed as he entered a hotel . 
  this used to be a strategy with flights if it was cheaper to stay over a saturday night but you only wanted to travel during a single week for a few days . 
  so you 'd buy outgoing return from monday to monday , and incoming return from friday to friday . 
  use one leg of each and skip the other . 
  was termed booking ` back to back ' flights and companies would use it to reduce travel costs . 
  i think it 's frowned upon as a practice now , but i do n't travel much for work anymore so i 'm not sure . 
  thanks , now that you mention it i think i remember reading about that . 
   the full documentary : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb2ifikowyu thanks for that . 
  i had it recorded but my recorder wiped everything a month or so ago . 
  i understand the conceptual difference , but they 're still related . 
  with a shadow economy worth 150 billion in 2013 , no national id card system , and queues of migrants trying to sneak into britain via calais and other ports , the uk might need to reconsider whether it cares about other europeans physically entering the country . 
  how does the uk stop people from other parts of the eu entering the uk post brexit ? 
  they have free movement in ireland , then if there 's no border they have free movement in the uk ? 
   we 'll see , but the eu cant expect ireland to adopt a border in ni again . 
  i 'd have thought the uk would want the border in the context of brexit ? 
   the problem is that those statistics are retarded i 'm happy to look at other statistics if you can propose them . 
  wage growth was relatively high last year at about 2 % and running ahead of inflation at about 0.2 % . 
  this despite record numbers of inward migration . 
  but why look at this logically when it 's such an emotive issue , eh ? 
  [ what have the immigrants ever done for us ? 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21631076-rather-lot-according-new-piece-research-what-have-immigrants-ever-done-us ) * the economist * commenting on a ucl study from 2014 . 
   by calculating european immigrants ' share of the cost of government spending and their contribution to government revenues , the scholars estimate that between 1995 and 2011 the migrants made a positive contribution of more than # 4 billion ( $ 6.4 billion ) to britain , compared with an overall negative contribution of # 591 billion for native britons . 
  between 2001 and 2011 , the net fiscal contribution of recent arrivals from the eastern european countries that have joined the eu since 2004 has amounted to almost # 5 billion . 
  even during the worst years of the financial crisis , in 2007-11 , they made a net contribution of almost # 2 billion to british public finances . 
  migrants from other european countries chipped in # 8.6 billion . 
  clearly not , in fact the uk already imports many highly qualified people . 
  the wage inflationary pressure is n't going to come from doctors and engineers though , at least not initially . 
  the jobs that will start being tough to fill will be at the lower end of the wage scale . 
  with unemployment running under its natural rate , that 's problematic for the uk . 
  the office of budget responsibility [ estimates the natural rate at 5.4 % ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-23545881 ) . 
  in november 2015 , the rate [ was estimated at 5.1 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/unemployment-rate ) . 
  the danger is an inflationary wage spiral as available workers become scarce , with knock-on effects on prices and competitiveness . 
  the schools in paris were individually called by telephone afaik . 
  [ curtains for semi-nude justice statue , from 2002 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1788845.stm )  no longer will us attorney general john ashcroft appear in public with a semi-nude statue towering above him . 
   the us justice department has spent $ 8,000 on curtains to hide the statue from the cameras . 
  no regular public school . 
  they patrol around all the schools of the town during the day . 
  a source for which ? 
  here 's a bbc article that mentions the [ reintroduction of privileges ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4941866.stm ) . 
  here 's a [ guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/oct/05/fromthearchive ) that covers my basic points and includes this :  the hunger strike ... may have started irish and british politicians down a path towards some form of reunification by bringing about a re-examination of the unionists veto on constitutional change . 
  maggie thatcher 's goal was to flat out deny the political aspect of the crimes committed by republicans . 
  she failed to do so . 
  in fact their situation was more politicized at the end of the hunger strike than before . 
  it ultimately backfired on the british government . 
  ira recruitment increased , sinn fein moved into electoral politics , and broad support for the republican movement 's aims ( if not their methods ) was achieved throughout ireland . 
  also , the privileges were slowly and quietly reinstated . 
  my kids ' primary school has an army patrol outside it regularly , as there have been specific threats against schools apparently . 
  fuck these medieval arsemunchers though . 
  they wo n't win . 
  edit : just read there have been bomb alerts in six paris high schools . 
  edit2 : seems to have been a hoax . 
  all the young fellas with their jumper sleeves turned into balaclavas . 
  here 's a stab at the gaelic ones : scots gaelic | meaning ------------- | --------- am faoilteach | time of the wolf an gearran | the short one an m\u00e0rt | latin root an giblean | not sure : perhaps the bits , the leftovers ? 
  an t-\u00d2gmhios | the new moon an t-iuchar | probably latin root an l\u00f9nastal | dedicated to the god lugh an t-sultain | the plenty , the abundance an d\u00e0mhair | rutting time for deer an t-samhain | samhain festival an d\u00f9bhlachd | the darkness, 
  english | irish | from -------- | ------- | --------- january | ean\u00e1ir | latin root february | feabhra | latin root march | m\u00e1rta | latin root april | aibre\u00e1n | latin root - maybe also implies `` rainy '' . 
  may | bealtaine | old irish ` bright fire ' . 
  bealtaine is one of the celtic festivals and marks the start of summer . 
  bonfires are traditional . 
  june | meitheamh | old irish for ` mid summer ' . 
  july | i\u00fail | latin root august | l\u00fanasa | named for the god lugh . 
  celtic festival to mark beginning of harvest season . 
  september | mean fomhair | middle autumn . 
  october | deireadh fomhair | end of autumn . 
  november | samhain | halloween festival . 
  end of harvest season and end of the year/beginning of the dark half of the year . 
  december | nollaig | old irish originally from latin root for `` birth festival '' . 
  the archaic ones mean : january - last month of winter , february - first month of spring , march - middle month of spring , april - last month of spring , and so on . 
  this is the same view of the seasons that we find in irish ( winter is nov/dec/jan , spring is feb/mar/apr , summer is may/jun/jul , autumn is aug/sept/oct ) . 
  i 'll write up the irish months later if i have time . 
   and what fix to do you suggest for libya , morocco , iran , etc ? 
  what 's wrong with morocco ?
