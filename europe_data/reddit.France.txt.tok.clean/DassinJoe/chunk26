  her harp looks more like a [ guinness harp ] ( http://stickerheaven4u.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/500x500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/g/u/guinness.jpg ) than an [ irish state harp ] ( http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/historical_information/the_harp/ ) . 
   in the short term , the imf said there would be a `` modest '' increase in gdp due to the extra state activity to support the migrants and the boost to the labour supply . 
  i 'd also expect extra state activity in processing claims , deporting fake claimants , and guarding borders . 
  i 'm not saying it 's systematic , just that this is a contributory factor in germany . 
  i 'm basing this on the articles . 
  i 'm taking it from the op 's article and the tagesschau.de article . 
  read them if you need evidence . 
  the op 's link :  ... patrick gensing , an expert in extremist ideologies , wrote that anti-semitic sentiments have diverse manifestations in germany . 
  he cited studies that point to `` ... national socialist racism ... '' and the tagesschau.de article states :  aus statistiken wird tats\u00e4chlich deutlich , dass die \u00fcberragende anzahl von antisemitischen straftaten von rechtsextremen begangen wird . 
  `` statistics show that the overwhelming number of anti-semitic crimes are committed by right-wing extremists '' ( my translation ), 
  the attacks i 'm referring to were in germany and are mentioned in the op 's article and in the tagesschau.de article i linked to above . 
  these attacks are listed as one reason jews do n't feel safe in germany . 
  why ` disgusting ' if it leads to the same outcome - attacks on jews ? 
  i do n't think israel is beyond criticism . 
  i do think blaming individual jews for israel 's actions is * disgusting * . 
  german police need to talk to eddie izzard about forming an elite squad of ` action transvestites ' . 
  next time there 's a big public gathering , send the action trannies to kick the living daylights out of any gropers . 
  i do n't understand why everyone takes this binary attitude to schengen - the argument seems to be that either it 's there or it fails forever!@!!, 
  but we 've suspended schengen before , and we can suspend it again . 
  then when we 've got our shit together in terms of policing schengen 's borders in an effective way ( and with costs shared ) , we can reopen it . 
  this all or nothing approach is crazy . 
  the truck drivers will lose the most - hours sitting in queues . 
  costs will rise a little but i do n't think by a huge amount . 
  people used to work across borders pre-schengen . 
  i suppose you get to know the border guards and after a while they wave you through . 
  here 's the original in [ tagesschau.de ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/juden-sicherheit-101.html ) it 's an awful mess . 
  anti-israeli sentiment from the left , plus traditional anti-semitism from the far right , plus anti-jewishness from the islamists . 
  immigration feeds the anti-israel islamists , and the ranks of the far right swell in reaction to increased immigration . 
  vicious spiral for jews . 
  which banlieue ? 
  or just any of them ? 
  do you want to take his gun away first ? 
   yeah , er a literal translation of * camana\u00edocht * is er , probably , `` quidditch '' . 
  the * sliothar * , oh yes that 's the `` snitch '' of course . 
  and those two big mean-looking brothers playing at half back are the bolgers . 
  paris does not have ` police no go ' areas . 
  that was some nonsense spouted by us pundits after the ch attacks last year . 
  excellent presentation of an interesting and difficult period . 
  there was an [ exhibition game ] ( http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2015/1123/748584-harte-hurling-classic-row-the-heat-of-battle/ ) between dublin and galway in boston 's fenway park last year . 
  unfortunately there was a bit of a brawl during the game , and this grabbed a lot of the headlines ... 
  it 's an amazing game . 
  fast , skilful , athletic , physical . 
  never a dull moment . 
  in ireland gaelic football and hurling are both huge . 
  gaelic football is closest to australian rules football , and there is a compromise set of rules used for occasional internationals . 
  hurling is a bit like gaelic football crossed with field hockey . 
  it 's somewhat similar to shinty ( played in scotland ) but much more popular as far as i can see . 
  youtube : [ compilation of gaelic football ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvuld0shh8 ) [ compilation of hurling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptz0zdhqtug ), 
  fair play to her . 
  discussions of britishness in ireland always remind me of ali g 's interview with [ sammy wilson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yarry9q0_xu ) . 
  good . 
  i hope he gives up some more accomplices . 
   brexit is n't going to turn plaid cymru or sinn fein into dominant political forces it does n't need to . 
  it just needs to give local politicians the scent of greater devolution . 
   you do realise that not everyone who supports brexit supports ukip , right ? 
  i do . 
  and i 'm also aware that ukip has been the public face of the eu withdrawal movement for almost 20 years . 
  basically since goldsmith 's crowd imploded . 
  if you refer back to what i wrote , i was quite clear that i was referring to `` most of '' the independence movement . 
  you may be a longstanding supporter of brexit who dislikes ukip , but i wo n't have heard of you because they get all the press . 
  nothing remotely ad hominem about that . 
  your points ? 
  you 've said that support for withdrawal is low in wales and ni , apart from that you 're simply contradicting me . 
  after a brexit all bets are off afaics . 
  the different nationalist parties will use it to try to gain more devolution . 
  they 'll ask for a referendum , and the carrot to keep the union will be greater local autonomy . 
  ukip historically has been southern english . 
  for example , the ukip northern ireland website is two years old . 
  here 's the [ 2014 european parliament voting by council area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_%28united_kingdom%29#/media/file:european_parliament_election,_2014_%28united_kingdom%29.svg ) in britain . 
  here 's 2009 [ by counting area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2009_%28united_kingdom%29#/media/file:european_parliament_election,_2009_%28united_kingdom%29.svg ) . 
  these are the elections in which ukip is most successful , and they 've only recently spread out of southern england . 
  if you 're sure of a brexit , ladbrokes will still give you 15/8 today . 
  here 's one in english : [ take back migrants or lose aid cash , berlin tells north africa ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20160118/berlin-threatens-to-withdraw-aid-to-north-africa-over-migrants )  germany 's vice-chancellor , sigmar gabriel , has threatened to withdraw aid from north african countries if they do n't cooperate on taking back rejected asylum seekers . 
  plaid cymru will use a brexit to renegotiate welsh position in the uk . 
   the eu can subsidize wales , northern ireland and scotland instead then let me guess , you 're english and pro-brexit ? 
  i think the irish will be happy enough with croatia - beautiful coastline with better weather . 
  is n't this simply giving trump even more of the attention he craves ? 
   i really would n't pay any attention to the polls at this stage of the game . 
  yes , it 's very early . 
  the brexit campaign is still missing a figurehead . 
  farage is too divisive . 
  the other issue is that if the uk pulls out , the scots will want to hold another independence referendum , and the welsh and irish may go in the same direction . 
  most of the uk ` independence ' movement is really concerned with ` english independence ' , and until recently was simply `` southern english independence ' . 
  the uk leaving europe might spell the end of the uk union . 
  ^ edit ^ - ^ clarified ^ ` end ^ of ^ the ^ uk ^ union ' . 
  i still have geraniums flowering in window boxes . 
  usually they 'd be long dead by now . 
  it 's only the last few days we 've had a proper freeze at night . 
  very little by the corsicans . 
  in france in the 1970s it was the far right and far left in the early years of the decade , then mostly anti-israel attacks ( karlos the jackal , the plo , fatah ) plus some armenians attacking turks . 
  early 80s was more from the anti-israel factions and from the armenians , plus the far left action directe . 
  the 1990s it 's the armed islamic group ( algerian fundamentalists ) plus i think one assassination by the corsicans . 
  but the bants is pants when you 're shooting non-combatants . 
  yeah , but when shoot to kill was applied to joyriding teenagers ... 
   nobody 's talking about a competition ...  the casualties are orders of magnitude different smh . 
  i 'm not getting into some human suffering competition . 
  i was specifically responding to your statement :  no one from the outside can really understand what seeing american soldiers pointing guns at 5-year-olds does to another 5-year-old seeing it on television . 
  i believe that irish people growing up in the 70s and 80s can understand this . 
  better yet , get a part-time job !, 
   no one from the outside can really understand what seeing american soldiers pointing guns at 5-year-olds does to another 5-year-old seeing it on television .
