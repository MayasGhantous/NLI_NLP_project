  really ? 
  i grew up watching soldiers on the streets of belfast and derry in the north of ireland . 
  i did n't particularly trust the british forces , but i did n't hate british people . 
   leaving lego everywhere yeah , right outside the bedroom . 
  or throw it on the bedroom floor while they 're sleeping . 
  she was playing the long con . 
  lulled you into trusting her bus-whispering instincts over the course of the year , then whammo !, 
  she led to a location from which you were sure to miss the bus . 
  much respect . 
  great loss . 
  belgium then sweden then denmark then france , according to [ this ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/belgium-contributes-the-most-isis-fighters-per-capita-of-all-countries-in-the-eu--b1yd_bwvtx ) . 
  somebody needs to devise a new way for teenagers to rebel . 
  well yeah , but there are [ other ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/poland-president-signs-bill-putting-state-media-under-government-control ) [ reasons ] ( https://euobserver.com/political/131662 ) for that ... 
  it is quite smart ; it uses juxtaposition to explore our contradictory feelings of outrage over the cologne attacks and sympathy for the boy who died . 
  it does this is a very crude and unsubtle way , typical ch style , but there 's a lot more to the cartoon than the knee-jerk reactions would suggest . 
  in any case , it 's a cartoon and people should calm down their outrage . 
   when did political correctness turn into this mindless witch hunt ? 
  i think when it became an industry in its own right . 
  we need a constant flow of outrage to keep our bien pensant mental gears turning fluidly . 
  the same happens on the right from what i can see . 
  a guy was knifed in marseille last week , and a few weeks ago someone tried to burn down a synagogue . 
  til - thanks !, 
  what sort of fuckheads beat a 73 year old ? 
  it 's possibly relevant , given recent attacks on jews and synagogues in france . 
  hmmm , maybe my cunning plan needs some work . 
  what would be the charge ? 
  i said `` move on '' and `` leave '' i think ; i do n't think i said ` move to england ' . 
  if the uk wo n't deal with them , they should probably go home yes . 
  or if that 's impossible and an anglophone country is so important , apply to the us or canada . 
  the problem is they ** really ** want to get to britain . 
  she was condemned by the organisation of islamic cooperation . 
  she 's been clearly and repeatedly critical of islam and sharia law . 
  they really want to be in the uk . 
  either they speak english , or they have family or friends or a network there , or they think their prospects are better there . 
  the pull is strong enough for them to live in shanty towns and take risks trying to sneak onto trucks . 
  the maghrebians should all speak french . 
  the syrians are less likely to . 
  she 's been spot on in her criticisms of [ saudi arabia ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/29/guardian-view-on-margot-wallstrom-undiplomatic-diplomat ) . 
  one of the few politicians in the world who 's prepared to call saudi to task . 
  she 's certainly ** not ** kowtowing to any arabs . 
  just say `` bonne chance '' to the purported asylum seeker and if they respond `` merci '' you can deport them immediately . 
  [ see also .

  okay , it 's quite different to granting citizenship , and it can lead to a lot of complaints when the time comes for the refugees to go home . 
  germany took a lot of bosnians in the 90s on this basis . 
  some of them were n't happy to leave when peace was established and they were deported . 
  yes , but the uk does n't want to even talk to them . 
  this has been dragging on for nearly 20 years ; some of the migrants agree to apply in france , but most refuse . 
  what about being granted ` permission to remain ' in a country while their homeland is unsafe ? 
  this will be the case with many syrians i expect - they 'll be given conditional residency in eu countries with the expectation that they 'll return home if/when peace is established in syria . 
  most of them have already passed through several eu countries to get to calais . 
  some could have conceivably landed on the south coast of france , but unlikely to risk such a long crossing when shorter ones are available . 
  but , they 're in calais now and if they refuse to apply in france they should leave . 
   also interesting to read there 's only 300 females & 30 children out of 2,000 people . 
  i 'm glad there are very few kids . 
  it 's a scary place . 
  i agree they should either apply in france or move on . 
  the lada niva must have been the world 's first suv . 
  anyone know what the microbuses were called ? 
  i generally find the scots and welsh easier to get along with but the english are mostly grand . 
  similar pattern for `` seblstverteidigung '' . 
  age uk reported [ 1.6 million pensioners living in poverty in 2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29647781 ) . 
  it seems there are many retired people who do n't have any private income - this will change in future years due to the workplace pension scheme , but for previous generations of workers , all they have is the state pension . 
  the uk should step up its game . 
  what a wonderful project !, 
   he was arrested three times in germany , and has a lengthy police record including charges of assault , theft and gun crimes . 
  i do n't understand how this guy was not in jail ? 
  also , in these days of cheap data storage and processing , there is no excuse for the lack of europe-wide ( or schengen-wide ) vision by the various authorities . 
  our tracking of people who enter our borders is pitifully inadequate . 
  [ a pint of plain is your only man . 
  ] ( http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~bradyn/flann.html ), 
  it 's still a wonderful place !, 
  a few dumb terrorists are n't going to ruin that . 
  my money is on a disaffected youth . 
  is it really so strange ? 
  france had many terror attacks in the 1960s-90s . 
  britain and ireland did too . 
  germany and italy had incidents of terrorism during the 1970s-90s . 
  the terrorists may have different causes now , but the goal of imposing their view of the world on everyone else is the same . 
  but fuck them , they wo n't win . 
  i agree re the hostage , but that 's why i wrote `` asap '' . 
  if you see a guy with what looks like a suicide vest , and his hands do n't seem to be holding a trigger , i think your best option must be to shoot him in the head immediately . 
  if you shoot the vest it might explode , if you shoot the legs he can still trigger , if you shoot one arm the other might be able to trigger . 
  in the last few years a few hundred of the calais migrants have given up - they 've accepted to apply for asylum in france and they 've been relocated to other parts of france . 
  they 're very much the minority , because most of the migrants want to go the britain . 
  it seems like the french ca n't win with this one . 
  people were sleeping in the streets in calais , so they opened sangatte refugee camp in 1999 . 
  this was criticized . 
  eurotunnel and britain asked for sangatte to be closed . 
  once it was closed in 2002 , the jungle sprang up . 
  the french authorities were criticized for allowing this to happen . 
  the jungle was cleared in 2009 . 
  the french authorities were criticized for clearing it . 
  it was reestablished and the french were criticized . 
  the french provide nothing for the inhabitants of the jungle and they attract criticism . 
  then they provide ( basic ) meals , and people complain that they 're encouraging migrants . 
  but yvette cooper has the answers to a problem that has persisted for nearly two decades . 
  good for her .

  no , but sending others to die while you remain safe is evidence of some level of smarts .
