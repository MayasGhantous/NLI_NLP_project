  i got a whole bunch to process this morning and of course every one has expired and the accounts are locked out . 
  i guess it 's automated , but seriously wtf ? 
  the cycling/vegetarian/renewables thing sounds like jeremy clarkson who used to do top gear . 
   this is an over-sweeping bill it can be applied to either end of the bmi spectrum exactly . 
  the legislation deliberately avoids focusing only on anorexia . 
  from the article : * the bill stipulates that models must obtain a medical certificate stating that their health , `` assessed in particular in terms of body mass index , is compatible with the practise of the [ modelling ] profession '' . 
  :-) that movie maybe encouraging people to go to dublin though . 
  i would n't grant them the respectability that `` state '' implies . 
  it 's just another term for isis , isil , is , that bunch of maniacs in iraq/syria . 
  lolling at the overinterpretation by various posters . 
  of course they 're islamic . 
   edit : since then they clarified they meant that they will order government employees to terminate individual 3g contracts , not to back off from tenders and development ones . 
  a government policy that stops employees from contracting with a company from another eu state ? 
  even that seems dubious from a legal standpoint . 
  i 'm explaining why there 's an investigation - she chose her response ( and she checked with a lawyer before posting , apparently ) . 
  [ here 's the text of the law ] ( http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcode.do;jsessionid=77f1ab0963d51cc8a534920813e348c7.tpdila13v_2?idsectionta=legiscta000006165283&amp;cidtexte=legitext000006070719 ) there 's a clear exception when distributing such images is part of normal exercise of profession to inform the public ( e.g. 
  documentaries ) or when it 's done as evidence against the perpetrators . 
  i would n't say it 's certain she 'll be charged with anything . 
  it 's the nature of her response . 
  she could have tweeted : `` beheadings , murders , slavery , suicide bombs , kidnappings , terrorism : this is isis '' and she 'd have been correct , and perfectly legal . 
  no harm , no foul . 
  instead she chooses to tweet pictures that isis uses as propaganda . 
  occam 's razor : she wants a legal investigation . 
  it is intended more against pictures of rape or violence against women i think . 
  apparently mlp consulted the fn lawyer before she tweeted the pictures , so she thinks she 's on safe ground . 
  she did take down james foley 's picture though , as that could be the basis for a different legal action by his family . 
  using isis propaganda is deplorable , but nobody has ever accused her of having an excess of good taste . 
  yes , since august 2014 it 's potentially subject to a fine or imprisonment . 
  she could also be sued by the families of the people in the photographs . 
  but it 's all a publicity stunt by le pen , so if she pays a fine she wo n't care . 
  it 's cheap advertising . 
  she just got acquitted in lyon for comparing [ muslim street prayers to the nazi occupation ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/marine-le-pen-not-guilty-inciting-religious-hatred-lyon-french-front-national ) . 
  suddenly she needs another imminent court case to keep her in the public eye ? 
  it 's massive amounts of publicity ; she 's seen to be ` exposing daesh ' for the murdering scumbags they are ; and at most she 'll probably pay a small fine . 
  this is marketing by the fn . 
  despicable , but it works for them . 
  finland because of education system and because i love finns . 
  interesting article . 
  my mother 's generation ( born 1940s ) would have systematically worn head scarves outdoors in the irish republic up to the 1980s i think . 
  my grandmothers would always have worn something on their heads . 
  this was social convention , rather than religious , though up to the 1980s catholic women were expected to [ cover their heads in church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_headcovering#catholicism ) . 
  joe dassin is eternal , 
  i was going to remark that col sanders could make a decent santa claus , but tpm is there already : [ how colonel sanders became father christmas in japan ] ( http://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/kfc-christmas-in-japan-colonel-sanders-history-12-23-2014 ), 
  marine le pen has been playing down the racist aspects of the fn for over a decade . 
  more recently , she appears to have made progress with the pink vote . 
  now we have the apparently contradictory situation where muslims and gays suport the fn , even though the fn has a history of islamophobic and homophobic tendencies . 
  m le pen is obviously a talented politician to keep together such a broad church , but for a populist party this is achievable * so long as the party is not in power * . 
  when/if the fn gets into a policy-making position , this coalition of diverse or even opposing interests will quickly fall apart . 
  in a position of power , le pen ca n't be fully opposed to gay marriage while simultaneously mute on the subject of gay marriage . 
  just in time for a general election in the spring ? 
  like pope adrian iv who encouraged henry ii of england to invade ireland ( allegedly even gave him the right to invade ) ? 
  or like pius ix who excommunicated fenians in the late 19th century ? 
  irish independence owes little to the rcc . 
  i worked at a bmw factory in the 1990s and it was full of turkish workers . 
  they did fine . 
  blair is a very odd fish . 
  crypto-catholic while in office , then converted after he left office . 
  vaguely apocalyptic in his views on the iraq and the me in general - watch him discussing sadaam hussein and he gets this weird fervent look in his eye . 
  he honestly seems to think he was `` doing god 's work '' in supporting the iraq invasion ( as opposed to the uk people 's work , which is what he was elected to do ) . 
  exactly , he 's particularly clueless about the me . 
  why do people still ask blair for his opinion ? 
  and where 's the bloody chilcot report anyway ? 
  yeah fair enough , 
  apparently there 's a picture of [ europa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28mythology%29 ) near the top right/left that is visible on both sides and somewhat translucent . 
  it 's probably the coolest ` new feature ' on the note . 
  historical note : europa was of syrian ( phoenician ) origin and may have entered greece ( crete ) illegally , though she may also have been a victim of human trafficking . 
  ^ edit : ^ spellink, 
  all clear given according to various on twitter : https://twitter.com/hashtag/sofia, 
  you keep misinterpreting me , either because your english is n't fluent or because you desperately want to quibble over points concerning the echr , thereby showing what exactly ? 
  that you 've read your college assignments ? 
  but hey , i grant your wish - i 've stopped . 
  i did n't say anything about ` always favouring secularism ' , i 'm simply pointing out that in this judgment the echr has established a way for european countries to adopt secularist policies without impinging on human rights . 
  i may be oversimplifying , as other countries do n't have the same tradition of la\u00efcit\u00e9 , but there 's no reason why secularism ca n't become a keystone of other societies . 
  * * at least those where the head of state is not also the head of the religion . 
  yes , that 's what i thought . 
  he claimed he was afraid to hand himself in because isis would attack his family , but he was also on the run from isis because he did n't blow himself up . 
  douglas hyde collected the * leabhar sg\u00e9ulaigheachta * , which was the first of these transcription efforts . 
  previous compilations of irish stories lost a lot of the imagery and flair when they were translated . 
  a european court upholds a secularist policy = = a win for european secularism . 
  other countries can adopt similar policies . 
  [ dublin in september ] ( http://utv.ie/news/2015/09/09/bottles-and-stones-thrown-at-dublin-fire-brigade-44682 ) [ south wales in august ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/youths-throw-stones-firefighters-tackle-9774926 ) [ west yorkshire last year ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-29934738 ), 
  no , but the same region includes the former socialist and communist strongholds around lille . 
  this area had coal mining and textile industries and is a bit like manchester or liverpool in britain . 
  lots of north africans went to the area in the 50s and 60s to take jobs in the factories , most of which are now closed . 
  it 's working class , post industrial , ethnically diverse but with a strong catholic history . 
  if the fn takes nord/pas-de-calais , this means that marine le pen has been successful in taking large numbers of votes from the leftist parties . 
  she 's remodelled the party to appeal to a much wider group than her father ever managed . 
  the french police are n't afraid to go anywhere . 
  if the regular police are wary of some place , they call up the crs ( riot police ) . 
  if the definition of a ` no go ' area is a place where the emergency services get attacked , i can think of several in ireland and the uk as well . 
  haha !, 
  j' adore !, 
  it 's perfect . 
  greece was thrown the wolves by the rest of the eu , especially germany ; crazy economic puritanism that results in human misery and not much else . 
  reminds me of the guys at calais over the past several years who 've refused to apply for asylum in france , preferring to live in a shanty town and try to jump the fence and sneak into a truck headed for england . 
  out of 3000 to 4500 last year , only about 100 eventually applied in france . 
  yes , he 's dignified and steady . 
  just a shame that it takes a security crisis to see this side to him . 
  the way i look at it : banning overt religious symbolism in the public sector is coherent with a secular society . 
  the us struggles with this frequently , though there it 's christian symbolism rather than muslim .
