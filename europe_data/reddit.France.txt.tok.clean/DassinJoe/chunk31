  read my comment again more slowly . 
  they 'll just cross their fingers and think of a united ireland . 
   so is n't this a contradiction ? 
  in terms of the origins of the words , perhaps , but for common usage i do n't think so . 
  one can be jingoistic about invading other countries while being a little englander in one 's attitude to immigrants . 
  bicycles and pot ? 
  there 's a trump media company being discussed , probably launched soon after the presidential . 
   nonetheless , the judiciary is causing an unnecessary constitutional clash . 
  one of the advantages of leaving the european union is that there will no longer be any law superior to an act of parliament , which may put the judiciary back into its rightful role . 
  this is an arse-backwards argument . 
  the judiciary is saying that an act of parliament is necessary to trigger art 50 . 
  rees-mogg simultaneously wants parliament to be be supreme while denying parliament a role . 
  also , parliament = = the commons , but not the lords , because he 's happy to stuff that chamber to achieve his ends . 
  that 's brilliant !, 
  love kirsty - she 's got a fine sense of the absurd .

  brexit is brexit . 
  it 's no laughing matter . 
  it 's like saying something was made in euope . 
  technically correct but lacking in precision . 
  if you say the titanic was `` made in britain '' , i think of the big shipyards in scotland or england . 
  if you say `` made in ireland '' , i know you 're referring to belfast . 
  the `` u '' part in uk refers to gb and ( n ) i. geographically , belfast is in ireland . 
  vote whichever way gets the best deal for your constituents or , more likely , for you personally . 
  i thought it was made in belfast ? 
  goes to the supreme court next i presume ? 
   while homeland security , ** external borders ** , ** climate policy ** and ** financial-market supervision ** should be managed more at european level ... according to the report . 
  the current uk administration would have a problem with at least three if not all four of these . 
  to some extent yes , though a lot of the time it was the west 's relationship with israel that the islamists used to justify their acts . 
  terrorism in europe i 'm not sure about that . 
  the munich massacre was early 70s . 
  the pflp was active in europe throughout the 70s . 
  then abdul nidal org , karlos the jackal , and hezbollah appeared in the 80s . 
  over the years most of the palestinian organizations have brought their problems to europe . 
  this is a major problem with distilling a 40-year relationship into one simple referendum question . 
   even the most generous observer notes that the eu is likely to lose more members in the next 10-15 years than gaining them . 
  who has noted this ? 
  the uk is leaving in 2.5 years , but who else is likely to leave ? 
  meanwhile , i think there are 6 candidates to join ? 
  jaysus kate o'connell is some muppet . 
  * i support your intentions but i ca n't vote for your bill because i might catch extreme leftism *, 
  or , holland ** e ** soon within maastricht criteria , maastricht is south east of holland , within limburg . 
  the traditional left has been distracted by identity politics and lost sight of goals that have mass appeal . 
  this seems a reasonable enough outcome . 
  the referendum was basically about immigration . 
  there are some who 'd would claim that it was also about * sovereignty * , but in most cases sovereignty is a proxy for immigration anyway . 
  when you probe someone 's reasons for * sovereignty * , in 9 out of 10 cases the goal is to control immigration . 
  occasionally someone will throw up a vague assertion about possible future eu interference with london as a financial centre , but it 's a difficult position to defend . 
  ** czechia ** central bank . 
  you 're projecting a lot onto my comment :-) i 'm simply pointing out that it is desirable in the long term to have a recalibration of the uk economy such that it becomes less dominated by the fire bias of london . 
  i have no preference whether this is driven by proud white factory workers , high-spirited brown software developers , or ebullient black data scientists . 
   through facebook ? 
  man up and apologize in person . 
  tom\u00e1s gil is back in spain . 
  fair play to kenya and tanzania . 
  they need to meme-ify it .

   right now it 's about deals and business . 
  in which case sturgeon 's position is a lot more sensible than may 's . 
   that 's a great way to side step what was really being asked . 
  if the questioner really meant `` are you undermining the national interest ? 
  '' , the questioner should have asked that . 
  as it stands , her response to the question is completely logical . 
  theatre , opera , art , orchestras , concerts , comedy , football , tennis , fashion , cinema , pubs , restaurants . 
  london is a great place to go out and enjoy oneself . 
  it has a huge range and variety of activities . 
  agreed . 
  there 'll be some loss to different places , including frankfurt , but i 'd expect a good portion of london 's business will continue . 
  arguably less activity in london might be a good outcome long term if it redresses the balance somewhat between london and the rest of the uk . 
  for people who are saying `` x is more famous than this person identified '' , here 's the [ description of the project ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/methods )  pantheon is a project developed by the macro connections group at the mit media lab that 's collecting , analyzing , and visualizing data on historical cultural popularity and production . 
   to make our efforts tractable , pantheon will not focus on culture , as it is understood in its broadest sense , but on cultural production . 
  in a broad sense , culture can be understood as all of the information that humans -- or animals -- generate and transmit through non-genetic means . 
  at pantheon , however , we do not focus on the entire range of cultural information , but in a subset of this information that we define narrowly as cultural production . 
  saying federer is more famous than rousseau misses the point of the index .

  it would certainly be interesting to me if i could buy an iphone post-brexit for cheaper in the uk than i can buy it in the us ( i.e. 
  assuming i can claim vat back when leaving the uk ) . 
  over the last 20 years i 've spent thousands on tech products when visiting the us . 
  [ dell went up very quickly . 
  ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/05/dell_confirms_price_rise_post_brexit_vote_as_uk_pound_stumbles/ ) so quickly that i 'd reckon they used brexit as an excuse . 
   ** the fact is i 'm not a politician ** , the guy was just asking me questions in the street . 
  it was an error of judgment . 
  i was very early coming into politics . 
  * but yeah , er , please vote for me in the leadership election of the political party !, 
  * ffs ... 
   so we 're now paying much less than the americans except that us sales taxes range from 0 % to 9.5 % whereas vat is i guess 20ish % in the uk ? 
  edit : never mind . 
  someone else has made the same point . 
   it 's like there are more than two possible solutions . 
  in general , when we use a description like the following :  portraying this as a situation where the government has offered some inherently superior option we imply a comparison , i.e. 
  the govt option is superior to the anarchist option . 
  now you 're introducing other options - that 's fine , but do n't be condescending following your failure to communicate clearly . 
  to summarise : you agree that what 's proposed by the anarchists is not possible , yet you do n't agree that the govt solution is superior ? 
  i 'm lost . 
   i see where this will inevitably lead and nope out right there . 
  no idea what conclusion you 're jumping to ( or even what that sentence means ) , but we used property ownership as a basis for the franchise for a very long time . 
   but portraying this as a situation where the government has offered some inherently superior option and people disagree just because is stupid . 
  you 're borderline name-calling at this stage . 
  stop it or i wo n't bother responding anymore .
