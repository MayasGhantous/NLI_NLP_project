  her slot on the agenda yesterday was ** after dinner ** . 
  she responds by saying that britain wants to stay central to eu decision-making . 
  * why yes of course teresa . 
  now , would anyone like a digestif ? 
   they do n't need the irish for that . 
  thatcher used the `` empty chair policy '' i 'm guessing the reference to obstructionism concerns the late 19th century practice of the irish parliamentary party . 
  i like both r/ireland and r/france though i spend more time in the former because i 'm linguistically lazy . 
  the irish sub is fairly relaxed ; the french sub is a bit more serious . 
  kicking children . 
  how brave . 
  i 've clicked [ every pixel but still no luck !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/spanishinquisition/ ), 
   no , that is different than threatening the uk of pain , which is essentially what he is demanding by his rhetoric . 
  that 's not what he 's saying . 
  his position is : 1 . 
  the uk ca n't get a special deal . 
  if the uk gets the benefits without the costs , other countries will want to leave . 
  the uk must bear the costs of being outside the eu , and this must be visible to other countries . 
  the original quotation is in [ this thread from a few weeks ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56bf4o/hollande_demands_tough_brexit_negotiations/ ) :  `` the uk has decided to do a brexit , i believe even a hard brexit . 
  well , then we must go all the way through the uk 's willingness to leave the eu . 
  we have to have this firmness , ''  `` if not , we would jeopardise the fundamental principles of the eu . 
  other countries would want to leave the eu to get the supposed advantages without the obligations . ''  `` there must be a threat , there must be a risk , there must be a price . 
  otherwise we will be in a negotiation that can not end well . '', 
  hmmm , a bit of editorializing here . 
  the post title is a rehashing of a two-week old quotation that formed the basis of a previous article [ discussed here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56bf4o/hollande_demands_tough_brexit_negotiations/ ) here 's the relevant part of hollande 's speech at the time :  `` the uk has decided to do a brexit , i believe even a hard brexit . 
  well , then we must go all the way through the uk 's willingness to leave the eu . 
  we have to have this firmness , '' president hollande told 150 guests at the 20th anniversary of notre europe , the pro-eu think-tank founded by jacques delors , the former eu commission chief . 
   `` if not , we would jeopardise the fundamental principles of the eu . 
  other countries would want to leave the eu to get the supposed advantages without the obligations . ''  the socialist leader insisted : `` there must be a threat , there must be a risk , there must be a price . 
  otherwise we will be in a negotiation that can not end well . '' the `` threat '' , `` risk '' , and `` price '' clearly concern `` other countries '' who might want to leave if they see the uk getting all the benefits with none of the costs . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/people_in_the_eu_%e2%80%93_statistics_on_geographic_mobility ) some more recent data from eurostat . 
   according to an ad-hoc module that formed part of the eu statistics on income and living conditions ( eu-silc ) survey in 2012 , some 17.6 % of the eu-28 's population moved home during the five-year period up to 2012 . 
  ----- this is the closest i can find to the data set depicted :  [ table 1 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:residents_who_moved_in_the_12-month_period_prior_to_the_census,_national_averages_and_regions_with_the_highest_proportion_of_people_moving,_2011_%28%25_of_population%29_pf15.png ) shows that 6.4 % of eu-28 population ( 32.0 million residents ) moved home during the year prior to the census ( ed : census concerned was 2011 ) : 3.6 % ( or 18.1 million residents ) from within the same nuts level 3 region ; 2.2 % ( 11.0 million residents ) from another region of the same country ; and 0.6 % ( 2.9 million residents ) from abroad . 
   ~ 2 % foreign workers . 
  it does n't say anything from where these workers came from . 
  ~ 2 % of workers arrived from another eu region during the last year . 
   the more purple are people moving out of their regions . 
  no , it says it 's people arriving on the chart . 
  why ca n't you send them back ? 
  i know . 
  makes me think the answer is `` by expending as little energy as possible while doing it '' . 
   ah the perpetually offended people at it again it 's a circle jerk of umbrage . 
  people are outraged about the tweet ; the * telegraph * is shocked that people are outraged ; i 'm incredulous that the * telegraph * is shocked ; someone else can be stunned that i 'm incredulous ; and so on and on until the next twitter-storm-media-fodder occurs . 
  in fairness this has been merkel 's line all along : negotiations start once art 50 is triggered and not before . 
  educate i 'd say is no problem . 
  i 'd worry about running after a lively toddler in my mid 60s . 
  my kids were born when i was in my 30s and even then there were some days when i was completely exhausted . 
  then there 's the issue of dealing with an adolescent when you 're in your 70s ... 
   it 's incredibly irresponsible of the tories to poke around trying to unpick it . 
  there are some within the tory party , michael gove is one example , who are old school imperialists and genuinely believe that the uk should never have signed up to the gfa . 
  more generally , the tories simply do n't care ; as they consider england more important than the rest of the union ( sorry wales , but deep down you know that includes you too ) . 
  voters throughout the island of ireland approved the gfa in good faith , but that 's now being jeopardized by what 's essentially an english government . 
  inside a school dealing with minors is quite different to `` in public '' dealing with everyone . 
  this sounds largely unenforceable .

   europe sounds like europa not just `` sounds like '' , they 're named after the same character in greek mythology . 
  europa ( the character ) is used by the eu as a symbol of europeanism - e.g. 
  on the latest 20 euro note . 
  here 's some context : [ iceland and the trials of 20th century tourism ] ( https://skift.com/iceland-tourism/ ) some excerpts for the time-challenged :  iceland 's recovery from the depths of the 2008 financial crisis has been remarkable , and is built on the back of an explosive growth in tourism . 
  from 2009 onwards , its tourist growth has been a hockey curve , and now a population of 350,000 residents will welcome about 1.6 million tourists this year . 
  [ us$ / kr\u00f3na ] ( https://skift.com/wp-content/themes/skift/iceland-tourism/hq-media/xe_currency-mr_zwpbteb.jpg )  icelandair , as the nation 's top international airline , played a crucial role by seizing on traveler demand by connecting north america and greater europe to iceland at a time when iceland 's overall economy was hurting . 
  the carrier moved to a hub-and-spoke model , with the goal of turning reykjavik into a connector for travelers headed from north america to europe , and vice versa . 
  ------  the number of hotel rooms in iceland has increased by 42 percent since 2010 , according to data from statistics iceland , with 394 hotels and hostels active across the country by the end of 2015 . 
  ...  airbnb has effectively doubled the number of rooms available to travelers , just at a time when both reykjavik as a city and iceland as a tourist destination needed it most . 
  ...  new legislation will take effect on jan. 1 , 2017 , with the goal of limiting speculation on real estate and tax evasion as a result of home sharing . 
  um , i know all this . 
  i already agreed with you on the eu 's negotiating stance . 
  i 'm referring to divisions inside the uk government . 
  the point i 'm making is that the `` soft brexit '' advocates ( e.g. 
  hammond , who would probably accept something along the lines of eea membership ) are being shut down by the `` hard brexit '' advocates . 
  you 're assuming there is a single uk position . 
  there is n't one yet , and if you read teresa may 's statements carefully you 'll see that she 's leading options quite open for the moment . 
  however , opinion seems to be solidifying around a `` hard brexit '' . 
   what is on offer from the eu has always been clear . 
  agreed , but the thread concerns `` brexiters shutting down debate in the uk '' . 
  the uk can look for an economically favourable but ( internally ) politically difficult compromise , or it can follow the path that it seems to have chosen and go for the ( internally ) politically easy but economically difficult approach . 
   the debate is mostly speculation about trends and the future . 
  i think most of the debate is about what the uk should be looking for in negotiations . 
  on the one hand there 's the remain crowd , along with ( afaics ) most business , exporters , banks etc. 
  who are arguing in favour of a `` soft '' brexit . 
  on the other hand there 's the true beleavers who are arguing for a `` hard '' brexit . 
  the new government seems predisposed towards the latter from what we 've heard at the conference . 
  philip hammond [ has come under pressure ] ( https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/politics/downbeat-philip-hammond-told-watch-back-brexit/ ) for voicing pessimistic opinions about the likely deal that the uk can get . 
  i was wondering who 'd spot that , 
   no , they had problems getting core inflation over 2 % for an extended period of time . 
  though the average since 2010 appears to be [ bang on 2 % ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-kingdom-core-inflation-rate.png?s=gbrcorecpirate&amp;v=201610180920o&amp;d1=20110101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;mean=1 ) . 
   secondly , the boe not only looks at current inflation but also * inflation expectations * . 
  well they 're sorted for a while anyway . 
   by the way , how do you do the neat little thing with the camera preview button for the link ? 
  i think it might be generated by your platform/browser - i do n't see any camera preview button on my desktop ( firefox/win ) or phone ( safari/ios ) . 
  i understand that a 2 % - ish target is normal enough for inflation . 
  i do n't understand / u/laboe 's phrasing `` struggling with core inflation going comfortably over 2 % '' . 
   uk inflation has been considerably under the target figure of 2 % for some years now let 's not get carried away , it 's only been [ a year and a half ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-kingdom-inflation-cpi.png?s=ukrpcjyr&amp;v=201610180859o&amp;d1=20110101&amp;d2=20161231 ) .
