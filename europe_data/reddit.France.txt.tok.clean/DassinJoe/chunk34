   as long as it does n't rise too far , will be a good thing . 
  hopefully , yes . 
  my concern is that it 's purely imported inflation , but will presumably add internal pressure on wages etc. 
  then there 's the whole issue of inflationary expectations and the new trading regime post q1 2017 ( price increases of 5 % , 10 % , more ? 
  today : shut off internet access . 
  tomorrow : ask him to start washing his own dishes , at a minimum . 
  next week : he 'll have to agree to cook one group evening meal and do his own laundry . 
  longer-term : pay rent , do some hoovering , take the bins out . 
  a lot of these are already in place : https://www.eurocontrol.int/functional-airspace-block-fabs-defragmenting-european-airspace the fabec has been functionally in place for some time , though it might have been called something else . 
  here 's the website : http://www.fabec.eu/fabec_homepage/en/ this is the key area of cooperation because the skies are so crowded . 
  the other blocks are less crowded . 
   struggling with core inflation going comfortably over 2 % i 'm not sure what you mean by this ? 
  do you mean the uk had a problem with persistent inflation of over 2 % ? 
  from what i recall , inflation dropped below 2 % in early 2014 and has remained below since , even dropping close to zero at times . 
  it 's rising now and likely will continue to do so for some time . 
  the [ current irish president ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_d._higgins ) is a poet ~ ~ a leprechaun ~ ~ and an all-round nice guy . 
  yeah , we 've heard this many times it seems . 
  i do hope it 's [ sailing to byzantium ] ( https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43291 ) on its maiden voyage . 
  safe landing schiaparelli !, 
  yes !, 
  i owe you a pint !, 
  here 's a le monde piece on his wife : [ h\u00e9l\u00e8ne muyal-leiris ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/visuel/2015/12/05/helene-muyal-leiris-35-ans-enmemoire_4825291_4809495.html ), 
   his wife does n't look native french wow , you 're a treat . 
   the prime minister 's demand that britain controls its borders and throws off the jurisdiction of eu judges has led many in london and brussels to conclude that british-based banks and insurers would inevitably lose the `` passporting '' rights that allows them to trade freely in europe . 
   but in a move likely to upset many conservative eurosceptics , mrs may has not ruled out making future payments to the eu to secure privileged access to the single market . 
  finance is among the sectors most likely to benefit in any deal that recognised the `` equivalence '' of regulatory regimes . 
   on friday , she assured japanese carmaker nissan that trading conditions for its sunderland car plant would not change after brexit , in the first suggestion that the government could pick favoured sectors to shield from the impact of leaving the eu . 
  at one point she promised that we would n't have a daily/weekly update on the uk government 's plans for brexit , but it seems that this is unavoidable . 
  how 's sterling doing this morning ? 
  the irish times ran a very good piece prior to the referendum featuring interviews with people in some of the border towns . 
  i ca n't find it now , but the gist of it was that these towns will suffer a horrendous decline in activity if a customs and/or immigration border is reintroduced . 
  this will jeopardise many businesses that have been built over the last 20 years on the basis of easy movement between ni and roi . 
  it 'll screw up even very simple arrangements , like antrim dairy farmers bringing their milk across the border for pasteurising/bottling/packaging ( despite this , most antrim dairy farmers appear to have voted ` out ' ) . 
  there 's no good solution for northern ireland , as far as i can tell . 
  unionists wo n't be happy if they 're obliged to pass through border control entering the island of britain , but everyone is in trouble if they 're going to check passports around the irish border . 
  even 50k would be hugely diminished from a few years ago . 
  it 's probably because it 's a non-story . 
  a few thousand marching in paris against a law that they failed to stop being introduced . 
  it 's the dregs of a movement that was more powerful and more numerous a year ago . 
  food price inflation this year , interest rate increases next year , along with demands for wage increases , lower employment , lower tax revenues , etc. 
  it 's time to start paying , but the uk will continue to pay for some time to come . 
  if reserve currency status is lost ( another thread ) there 's a serious risk of permanent relegation of the uk economy to a second tier status . 
  meanwhile the tory govt behaves like a bunch of reckless teenagers determined to outdo each other in bravado and foolhardiness . 
  if countries could be given a darwin award , the uk would be the hottest tipped candidate this year . 
   we waited a long time for this . 
  for what ? 
  to reunite with the frisians ? 
  you 're spouting bollocks . 
  if you want a language that separates you from europe , learn welsh . 
  i do n't give a fuck , but i can say the same about the rest of your royal scandals . 
  margaret slept around a lot , mark had a bastard , fergie is a slut , andy is a crook , harry 's a nazi . 
  sure who cares ? 
  they 're only people . 
  it 's only retards who think they 're somehow special . 
  i wo n't bother because you 're inventing scenarios . 
  okay , so when you write `` literally '' you mean `` theoretically '' . 
  here 's the background : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/helicopter_money it 's supposed to be a quick , one off stimulus to provoke demand in a deflationary , demand deficient context . 
  it 's far more appealing as a stimulus measure than giving money to dodgy banks to shore up their balance sheets , which is all i can see thus far from qe worldwide . 
  can you cite an occasion when this measure has destroyed an economy ? 
  i guess this polling was conducted just before the tory conference ? 
  bizarre article looking for a sensational story where at the moment there is n't one . 
  juppe will probably win against le pen in the 2nd round . 
  if it 's not juppe , it 'll be whoever is against le pen . 
  as long as she refuses to drop the old fn , she 's not electable no matter how ` reformed ' she tries to make the party appear . 
  it 's certainly worth considering and could n't be less effective than the completely unstimulating stimulus programs we 've seen with qe . 
  he looks like he 's crowd surfing but a bit nervous about it . 
  curtailing product of the a380 unfortunately : https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/airbus-to-cut-back-production-of-a380-aircraft, 
  exodus , all right !, 
  movement of bank people !, 
  all right !, 
  exodus : movement of bank people !, 
  yeah-yeah-yeah , well !, 
  open your eyes and look within : are you satisfied ( with the life you 're living ) ? 
  we know where we 're going , uh !, 
  we know where we 're from . 
  we 're leaving brexit-land , we 're going to our father land . 
   charles love life has generally been the main source of turbelance i assume you include diana 's love life in that too , but do n't forget margaret , mark phillips 's lovechild , andy & fergie , or harry the nazi in vegas . 
  oh i dunno , i think he 'll just take it for a couple of years to spite the begrudgers , then hand it on to william . 
  who is the hero character ? 
  piast the wheelright ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ why ^ ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ ^ googling ^ ^ ^ ^ polish ^ ^ ^ ^ heroes . 
  wow , thank fuck these terrorists are so incompetent !, 
   the government will look at `` kinetic '' options to intervene that 's pretty nebulous . 
  i 'm not comfortable with bojo the clown being in charge of uk foreign policy in times of war . 
  could there not be a separate minister for that sort of thing ? 
  minister for foreign interventions ? 
   jeremy hunt , the health secretary , suggested that his department had some evidence that student visas were being misused to obtain free access to the nhs via `` health tourism '' . 
  this should be simple enough to demonstrate if they 've got any decent stats collection . 
  worst.tetris.ever . 
  agreed , but that 's not looking likely . 
  it 's an opinion piece and clearly represented as such . 
  this disclaimer is to be expected . 
  in all fairness though , i do n't remember either side saying that marmite supplies could be threatened . 
  for god 's sake man , this has become serious and / u/enfield303 's breakfast is on the line !, 
  like a drifter i was born to walk alone !, 
  bye bye now . 
  enjoy yourself . 
  bank of england is independent of the uk government . 
   original statement you took offense with : no , i pointed out the first problem already . 
  cheerio .
