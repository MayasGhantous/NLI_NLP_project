  lol . 
  let 's take another look at why we went down this particular rabbit hole . 
  you said :  in reality on the other hand , this is simply a demonstration of the fact of just how powerful speculators on the market have become . 
   `` there 's a bit of doubt about this country , let 's cash in on the currency fluctuations '' . 
  ** used to work only on small states . 
  now it works on uk sized economy . 
  ** which is patently wrong , because it worked on a uk sized economy in 1992 . 
  when i corrected you , you started to waffle , and you 've been waffling ever since . 
   your bringing this up suggests alarming lack of understanding of very basics of the subject we 're discussing . 
  you do n't understand the point and i 've had enough trying to explain it to you . 
  cheerio . 
  i agree there 's something else going on , though my impression is that tesco is looking for some positive publicity for `` defending customers against the evil unilever dragon '' . 
   presidential rival sarkozy , whom he described as `` a duracell bunny who is perpetually agitated '' that 's a remarkably good description of sarko . 
  australia should ship emergency supplies of vegemite to uk . 
  i do n't think so , not with the flowers in bloom . 
   factually false for reasons outlined above . 
  if you want to argue everything from first principles every time , you should clarify that it was n't possible during the gold standard years because the gold would have been too heavy . 
  i made it clear above , the first time i corrected you , that it has been possible since the early 1990s . 
   that was only available to very small portion of speculators . 
  it was available to people who were in a position to borrow , i.e. 
  those who had enough money under management to be able to pay the interest due and/or whatever downside might occur from the trade . 
  this was possible throughout the 1990s , throughout the 2000s , and it continues to be possible now . 
  the only `` sudden '' increase in the power of speculators happened over 30 years ago . 
  since then , attacks on a major currency happen when that currency is overvalued relative to macro indicators . 
  marion mar\u00e9chal le pen tweeted in july that she 'd try to sign up to the army reserve . 
  not sure how it worked out for her . 
  edit : she [ submitted her application in september ] ( http://actu.orange.fr/politique/reserve-militaire-marion-marechal-le-pen-a-depose-son-dossier-magic-cnt000000ta3ol.html ) . 
  very sandy soil above ? 
  very chalky soil ? 
  it 's a beautiful place . 
  here is the pinetum on [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/06046+castelluccio,+province+of+perugia,+italy/@42.815949,13.1951421,773m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x132e131cecd0f23d:0xa082c9383c1b8d0!8m2!3d42.8286009!4d13.2090048 ) . 
  invasion in the sense that he brought foreign troops onto british soil yes . 
  but with typical dutch politeness , he would n't invade until he had first been invited . 
   believing that the english people would not react well to a foreign invader , he demanded in a letter to rear-admiral arthur herbert that the most eminent english protestants first invite him to invade . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_iii_of_england#invasion_of_england he was invited . 
  due to protestant betrayals of the king , william was more or less unopposed . 
  [ `` invade '' ] ( http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/wiiiinvite.html ), 
   what is worst is the dental of many brexiters the uk has a [ long and proud tradition of poor dentistry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hohipvl2mwk ) . 
  yeah , it 's always great to look at photos from the mars surface . 
  dwayne johnson is the rock , whereas his father was simply rocky . 
  i thought we knew this already ? 
  prison is a perfect environment to recruit people into gangs of different types . 
  bored , nothing to do , separated from family and friends , offered support from the radical bloke with the long beard - it 's the basic technique that brainwashing groups have been using since the 60s . 
   if there was hard evidence of speculation , there 's always hard evidence of speculation . 
  there 's been regular news about people shorting sterling since june . 
  information about short positions is available on the internet . 
   it 's not the `` well managed '' part that makes it exceptional . 
    it 's the size of the economy affected . 
  i 'll try once more . 
  there is enough liquidity around for speculators to attack any currency at any time . 
  this is n't new , as soros showed in ' 92 : he increased his position against sterling from $ 1.5 billion to over $ 10 billion in a single day . 
  the speculation occurs when the expected return is sufficient and the risk is low enough . 
  in this case , soros reckoned on two things , first that the there was very little chance sterling could appreciate because everyone considered it was already overvalued , second that his actions would be observed by other speculators and they 'd follow suit , ultimately putting so much pressure on the pound that it would fall out of the erm . 
  the key feature of this is the management of the currency : the uk government was keeping sterling inside the erm even though this was n't the best thing to do for the uk economy . 
  basically sterling had a big target on its back for several months . 
  the story here is different , but the key shared feature is economic management ; sterling has gone from a predictable , boring , safe currency to one that is prone to rapid changes because of uncertainty , not because of available liquidity . 
  lander is named for [ giovanni schiaparelli ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/giovanni_schiaparelli ), 
  no , the purpose of fom is to facilitate labour markets . 
   would n't that also be applicable to the uk if the uk can negotiate it , sure why not . 
  [ vicky ford was making the case in the guardian recently . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/liechtenstein-solution-key-to-softer-brexit-tory-mep ) it was easier for liechtenstein to argue the case , however , given they 'd only about 36000 people at the time of joining the eea . 
  it 's not that exceptional in currencies worldwide . 
  what 's exceptional at the moment is the uncertainty for the uk ; it 's normally a relatively well-managed economy . 
  the change is not that speculators are more powerful , it 's that the uk has become more unstable . 
  i do n't really give a rat 's arse , thanks . 
  just wondering why you made the assumption . 
  but yeah , you 're right . 
  your comment looks a bit dumb now . 
   now it works on uk sized economy . 
  it has done for decades . 
  soros brought sterling down in the early 90s . 
  but the article is about more than speculative positions . 
  why do you think it 's a `` he '' ? 
  subject = citizen if you recognise a monarch . 
  census schmensus . 
  it sounds like it 's asking people about their feels . 
  you 're a subject of the united kingdom and northern irish , surely . 
  that 's very strange . 
  i thought it was the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ? 
  how can you be british and northern irish ? 
  do you have dual citizenship ? 
  two passports ? 
  irish or northern irish . 
  same thing really . 
  if you 're a uk citizen you 're not british though . 
  but sure you 're irish not british anyway . 
  why do you give a fuck about the brits ? 
  i think you should be looking at number of people rather than size , which brings it to a cap of 160k . 
  the point is not that there 's a shortage of physical space for additional persons ( there may be ) , it 's that liechtenstein retain a national identity . 
  no more coals to newcastle ... 
   dominoes take a while to tumble . 
  er no , they clearly do n't . 
  the point of a ` domino effect ' is that one thing falling provides the impetus for another to fall . 
   the eussr ah okay , you 're one of those . 
  lol . 
  context : catholic school in doncaster , england . 
  this is a shame . 
  i knew a few people who worked there in the past . 
  cutbacks in the newspaper industry are heavy going .
