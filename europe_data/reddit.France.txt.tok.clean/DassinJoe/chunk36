  there 's no analysis in either the original article or the linked ft article . 
  he 's grandstanding , i think . 
  ** q : ** why are some trying to turn life into one big hate-crime ? 
  ** a : ** to give you something to complain about in your column douglas . 
   countries it tries to hammer economically lol , butt hurt before anything has happened ? 
  negotiations have n't even started and you 're already whining , 
  i 'm aware that may has promised to trigger article 50 by end of march 2017 . 
  i 'm not sure we 'll have details by march 11th . 
  that was unexpected . 
  not sure we 'll have details in 5 months , but whatever . 
  16 months . 
  uk position predicted to be full control of migration plus no tariffs . 
  i 'm not familiar with the judo ranking system , but according to wikipedia he was awarded 8th dan in 2012 . 
  this is apparently quite high . 
  let me put it another way . 
  the negotiating term , with respect to immigration , is it : a. full control on immigration b. partial control on immigration ( e.g. 
  liechtenstein ) c. no control on immigration the negotiating term , with respect to tariffs , is it : a. no tariffs b. preferential tariffs ( e.g. 
  mfn or some other special arrangement ) c. wto tariffs, 
  the archangel putin holds earth in his hand as one would a bowling ball . 
  cherubim and seraphim festoon him with floral arrangements as he prepares to knock over the onlooker by throwing the planet at them . 
   no but you say the terms are set ? 
  what will it be ? 
  if it 's none of the three i proposed , you must have a novel scoop . 
  okay . 
  i mostly use them in the us and they 're pretty variable . 
   what i meant though is that the terms regarding the negotiating position of the uk are pretty much set . 
  okay , so will it be wto rates with full control on migration , single market access with no control on migration , or somewhere in between these extremes ? 
  and if the terms are set , why wait to negotiate ? 
   proven as well naturally , they do n't need to weigh in laws , because this is n't about legality , but rather principles of ( direct ) democracy . 
  that 's all very vague and we will see the outcome in a few years . 
  i 'm not saying that mps should have a vote , by the way . 
  i 'm pointing out that the terms of brexit are very far from set . 
  yes , but they 're often less transparent than an fx kiosk . 
  does an atm tell you the rate they 'll apply or the commission they 'll take before you commit to a transaction ? 
  this is coming from drug dealers who wanted to smash a surveillance camera because it was interfering with their trade . 
  attacking the police with stones happens occasionally when the drug gangs get disrupted - the use of petrol bombs is a scary new development and seems completely over the top ( breaking a butterfly on a wheel ) . 
  this makes me wonder if there 's some really crazy person or people instigating it . 
  the police will catch the perpetrators . 
  they left a lot of evidence to be collected ( video , fingerprints , etc ) . 
  valls says he 's going to make an example of them . 
  not sure what to expect but the guys who are higher up in the drugs operations will not be pleased because this stuff is very bad for business . 
   the reasons people voted out have been discussed intensively discussed yes , proven no . 
  these reasons have no weight in law . 
  it 's not possible to take into account why people voted out ( or in ) , as there 's no way to assess the motivation for each vote in a plebiscite . 
  what matters is the decision to `` leave the european union '' , that 's all . 
  the `` terms '' will be negotiated once article 50 has been triggered . 
   a norway-like eea deal has been ruled out by the public as immigration restrictions for eu citizens are part of the terms . 
  this seems to be wishful thinking on your part . 
  the public has voted to leave the eu , that 's all . 
  there was a simple question put to the public and answered by the public . 
  over the coming 30 months , `` terms '' will be decided by the negotiating teams . 
  may 's interpretation of that vote could be that a norway-like deal has been ruled out , but we wo n't know that for sure for at least a year . 
   the terms are decided the terms are nowhere near decided . 
  there was a vote to `` leave the european union '' . 
  that 's what 's decided . 
  the terms on which the uk will leave will be negotiated from a range of options that runs from default wto regs to a norway-like eea deal . 
  signs are currently for a `` hard brexit '' , but this may be positioning in the run up to negotiations . 
  happens if you have to travel a lot with short turnarounds . 
  people have back-to-back trips where they get home friday evening after the banks have closed and set off again on sunday evening . 
   most of the expats where i am in spain stuck it out . 
  i know some who did n't manage and returned to the uk , but i think their expectations vis a vis the exchange rate were unrealistic . 
  in france he 's normally referred to as poutine , rather than put ( a ) in . 
  of course poutine for the canadians is * a fast-food dish made with french fries and cheese curds topped with a light brown gravy . 
  i used to visit this region regularly for work , but not so much recently . 
  i need to find a way to change that and make regular visits again . 
  the countryside and towns are so lovely !, 
  yeah i saw that after . 
  yeah , there 's plenty of public support for tory xenophobia . 
  may had an interesting first conference as leader , outflanking ukip on the right while outflanking labour on the left . 
  i 'm not sure how much will come of it , but she 's generated plenty of press . 
  the 75 % rate was dropped very quickly . 
  christopher booker in the telegraph is * still * arguing that may will seek an eea deal . 
  breakfast means breakfast . 
   whole thing was a pathetic setup for some shitty garbage news channel trying to create a story . 
  yeah , unfortunately it got picked up by many more reputable news outlets . 
   but the response to you i have is german cars . 
  also italian wine , according to bojo . 
  this is more about companies than countries . 
  thrust of the article is that city of london is important to european countries , but not important enough to justify undermining the wider eu . 
  they 'd rather lose london services and keep the eu rather than keep london services but imperil the eu . 
   eight years ago , the champagne socialists pretended to be outraged by these banks what ? 
  how does that relate to this article ? 
  who are you talking about ? 
  these socialists are relevant why ? 
  johnson is in theory acting for may , but he has strayed from the script several times recently and he 's trying to put pressure on his boss by supporting the hard brexiteers . 
  she has slapped him down publicly twice in the last month . 
  his faux-buffoonery is wearing quite thin now that he has a proper job . 
  sch\u00e4uble is signalling what a lot of people feel : johnson is n't up to the position of foreign secretary . 
  two years after may invokes art 50 . 
  beautiful plumage !, 
  pffft , is this wolfgang guy some sort of * expert * ? 
  i think he 'll find the british people , bojo included , have had enough of experts . 
  it 's just direct translation . 
  in french one can say `` un anglais '' for an englishman , `` une anglaise '' for an englishwoman . 
  i discussed this with someone on reddit recently . 
  apparently the orthography is heavily influenced by welsh ( brythonic ) even though the language is goidelic . 
  fascinating and a bridge for me to welsh . 
  relax the head there . 
  you linked fucking nothing in the post i responded to . 
  that 's a bloomberg article about the british cabinet 's decision .
