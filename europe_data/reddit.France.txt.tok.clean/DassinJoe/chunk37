  cowardly little fuckers acting tough in a group . 
  hope they get caught and punished severely . 
  but does the parliament 's vote mean anything ? 
  the council has to approve the deal , can the parliament block it ? 
  boris is keeping up the pressure as part of the `` change britain '' group . 
  the ep can `` ratify '' the agreement ; i think it 's only the council that can approve/block it . 
  the uk wo n't vote on it at council , so why should they vote in the parliament ? 
  why elect representatives who will serve only a small part of their term ?

  not sure why civitas is getting involved in this . 
  maybe / r/europe could put a quota on brexit stories per week ? 
  though i guess there 's a risk we 'll end up with a brexit story mountain that will have to be dumped at some stage . 
   until the uk parliament passes a law accepting to rejecting the referendum there is no legal basis for article 50 to opperate .

   so far , the process has not started . 
  they are not in the process . 
  oh right , let 's look again at what i wrote :  the uk should n't vote in european parliament elections ** if they 're in the process ** of withdrawing from the union, 
  schulz has a good point - the uk should n't vote in european parliament elections if they 're in the process of withdrawing from the union . 
  boris was hinting late 2018 , but theresa is n't happy with him : [ theresa may stamps her authority on brexit plans after boris johnson strays from the script ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/downing-street-theresa-may-authority-over-boris-johnson-article-50-comments-a7324566.html )  by the early part of next year , you will see an article 50 letter ... you invoke article 50 in the early part of next year ( and ) you have two years to pull it off . 
  i do n't actually think you need to spend the full two years , but let 's see how we go . 
  less than two years to negotiate ... more bojo :  not only do we buy more german cars that anybody else , we drink more italian wine than everyone else - they 're not going to put that at risk . 
  so there you have it , because the uk drinks more italian wine than everyone else , they can write their own deal .

  ** burkini woman chased from the beach in villeneuve-loubet -- a setup ? 
  ** this previous saturday , australian television station channel 7 aired a video of a woman in a burkini being chased off villeneuve-loubet beach by bathers . 
  according to a witness , the scene is a complete fabrication . 
  according to a video posted by an australian television station , alshelh zeynab , a 23-year-old student , was forced to leave the beach of villeneuve-loubet where she was installed . 
  the reason ? 
  her burkini , deemed provocative by other bathers . 
  the story was picked up by all media including agence france presse . 
  but according to a mother who was on the beach at the time , the scene that took place under her eyes was more than suspicious . 
  `` we were sitting on the beach with my children , when we saw the camera set up a few meters from us , '' she says . 
  `` it was only after that a man and two women in burkini arrived . 
  they walked a few minutes along the beach and came to settle in front of the tv team . '', 
  so was it a set up ? 
  `` we immediately asked ourselves that question . 
  that is also why all the people on the beach are looking toward the camera . '', 
  but the video broadcast by the australian channel goes further . 
  it shows a man head toward the camera and blurt out , `` you turn around and you leave . '', 
  the way that the report is structured , it seems like his invective is directed against the two women in burkinis . 
  an impression that is supported by the voice off video that confirms : `` we were forced to leave because people said they would call the police . '', 
  but this is not the case . 
  `` the man in the video is my uncle , '' according to our witness . 
  `` he never asked that these three people leave the beach . 
  he was speaking to the camera to ask the cameraman to leave . 
  there were children on the beach , including ours , and we did not want them to be filmed . '', 
  the rest of the video shows the same man making a phone call . 
  `` yes , he called the police . 
  not to ask them to chase away these people , but to ask what we could do to prevent the camera from filming us , especially our children . '',
