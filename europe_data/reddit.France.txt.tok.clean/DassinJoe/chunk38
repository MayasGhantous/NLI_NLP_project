  ftfy, 
  quick translation of the nice matin story : ** burkini woman chased from the beach in villeneuve-loubet -- a setup ? 
  ** this previous saturday , australian television station channel 7 aired a video of a woman in a burkini being chased off villeneuve-loubet beach by bathers . 
  according to a witness , the scene is a complete fabrication . 
  according to a video posted by an australian television station , alshelh zeynab , a 23-year-old student , was forced to leave the beach of villeneuve-loubet where she was installed . 
  the reason ? 
  her burkini , deemed provocative by other bathers . 
  the story was picked up by all media including agence france presse . 
  but according to a mother who was on the beach at the time , the scene that took place under her eyes was more than suspicious . 
  `` we were sitting on the beach with my children , when we saw the camera set up a few meters from us , '' she says . 
  `` it was only after that a man and two women in burkini arrived . 
  they walked a few minutes along the beach and came to settle in front of the tv team . '', 
  so was it a set up ? 
  `` we immediately asked ourselves that question . 
  that is also why all the people on the beach are looking toward the camera . '', 
  but the video broadcast by the australian channel goes further . 
  it shows a man head toward the camera and blurt out , `` you turn around and you leave . '', 
  the way that the report is structured , it seems like his invective is directed against the two women in burkinis . 
  an impression that is supported by the voice off video that confirms : `` we were forced to leave because people said they would call the police . '', 
  but this is not the case . 
  `` the man in the video is my uncle , '' according to our witness . 
  `` he never asked that these three people leave the beach . 
  he was speaking to the camera to ask the cameraman to leave . 
  there were children on the beach , including ours , and we did not want them to be filmed . '', 
  the rest of the video shows the same man making a phone call . 
  `` yes , he called the police . 
  not to ask them to chase away these people , but to ask what we could do to prevent the camera from filming us , especially our children . '', 
  she added : `` at no time did anyone ask the women in burkini to leave the beach . '', 
  ** it was too extreme to be true ** a version corroborated by another witness at the scene . 
  `` we saw that it was scripted , it was too extreme to be true and it smelled like a put up job , '' says st\u00e9phane . 
  he was in the water with his children at the private beach corto maltese , when he saw the small team arrive on the beach . 
  `` the man and the two women arrived almost running to get installed . 
  in 10 seconds , they had unfolded their napkins and planted their umbrella . 
  they started in the middle of the jet ski aisle for the private beach . 
  as they were obstructing , the owner of the beach asked them to move on . '', 
  only after that st\u00e9phane realized there was a journalist and cameraman `` hidden '' behind the cars , filming . 
  he said that at that time , the owner of the beach had brought the small group into his restaurant . 
  `` they came out after a while . 
  the man and the two women continued to walk along the beach towards the siesta . 
  sometimes they settled . 
  then they left . '', 
  the reporter and the cameraman , who had pretended to leave , were always hidden behind the cars . 
  `` it looked like they were waiting for reactions . '', 
  st\u00e9phane observed at a distance the the scene of the bather who urged journalists to leave the premises . 
  `` i saw the gentleman on the phone . 
  but i was too far away to hear what he was saying . '', 
  the small group eventually left . 
  `` there was a vehicle waiting for them up the beach , as if to extricate them just in case ... '', 
  this confirms my suspicions about this story . 
  there 's clear discrimination at play . 
  what 's interesting is that a turkish name is a disadvantage ( about 5 % less likely ) while wearing a headscarf makes it nearly impossible ( about 14 % less likely , bringing likelihood under 5 % ) . 
  the next question is what to do about this ? 
  germany could check every single job application but that would be insanely cumbersome . 
  turkish women could change their surnames ( as many people did in the us ) but that seems unreasonable . 
  or we could consider a rapprochement : german businesses are encouraged to ignore people 's surnames and muslim applicants are encouraged to drop an item of clothing that 's becoming increasingly divisive . 
  i 'd assume most encrypted messaging apps have back doors these days . 
  it 's more a question of whether they 're accessible to state agencies . 
  yep , and even in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality it sounds like it could be a crime to travel for a termination . 
   some british politicians have complained the eu negotiating line-up , including barnier , represents interests hostile to britain . 
  it 's really unfair that the british were n't allowed to choose both teams of negotiators . 
   if passed , the rules will introduce jail sentences of up to five years for ` the death of a conceived child . ', 
  i 'd guess it could be yes . 
   i think of schools like eton college etc. . eton , harrow , rugby etc. 
  are called * public schools * . 
  historically , they were open to the public rather than having strict entry criteria . 
  the grammar schools are selective entry and maybe free or fee paying , depending on where you are . 
  edit : it appears that some fee paying schools are just called `` grammar school '' , but they 're not really in the grammar school system , e.g. 
  fair play . 
   according to the figures compiled by sector regulator the financial conduct authority ( fca ) , 5,476 uk-regulated financial firms use passporting rights to operate in other eu countries . 
  meanwhile , 8,008 eu firms used them to sell services in britain . 
  did anyone find the fca report ?
