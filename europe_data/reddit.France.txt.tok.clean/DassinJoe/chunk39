  i tried their website but could n't see it . 
  would be relevant to look at volume of trade rather than just raw numbers of firms . 
  i did n't suggest 40 % at first round . 
  i 'd expect more like 27 % -30 % at first round , then depending on who is her opposition she could range from 31 % to 40 % in the second . 
   still though , getting 40 % of the vote . 
  that 's really worst-case scenario , if she was running against sarko in the second round . 
  she might convince one third or even 40 % of the electorate , but a majority will still oppose her . 
  the next but one election ( 2022 ? ), 
  she might have a chance , but next year i do n't see it happening . 
  disappointed it 's not boar sausage . 
  what 's french for * agent provocateur * ? 
   ms alshelh said she and her family travelled to france to learn more about the situation and see if there was `` anything that we can do to help these girls just live a normal life '' . 
  they travelled to france ** with a film crew ** . 
  they were on the beach ** with a film crew ** . 
  they seemed to be on the beach for a while before somebody comes over to talk to them . 
  plenty of hitchhiking around where i live ( 50 k south of paris ) . 
  i give people lifts sometimes , but usually i have a car full of kids so i ca n't . 
  i used to hitchhike in ireland too , especially in the countryside . 
  people generally are cool . 
   well you did state an uniformed opinion the word you 're looking for is `` uninformed '' . 
  i made an empirical statement , the rest is you interpreting what i said . 
  my statement is based on two pieces of information : she says she does n't think she should be treated as an oddball . 
  she wants to wear something to school that nobody else wears . 
  there 's a contradiction here . 
  you may not see it , but it exists nevertheless . 
  i have n't said anything about her motives ; i 've simply remarked on her statement and intention . 
   damn , you must be a mind reader i knew you were going to say that !, 
  and they call it a ~ ~ mine ~ ~ migrant camp ... 
  it happened in the early 1980s . 
  the sdp was a labour splinter group and took 20 + mps out of the party . 
  i expect something similar in the next 12 months . 
  it 's the legacy of the [ collins report ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ray_collins,_baron_collins_of_highbury ) . 
  labour leadership elections have become tortuous affairs . 
  i was pointing out : she says she does n't want to be singled out . 
  she wants to wear something that will single her out . 
  you think a head wear ban in a school is the equivalent of state enforced racial segregation ? 
  lol, 
  that article seemed quite decent , and the author 's credentials are impressive . 
  these are the key points from moody 's :  moody 's said it thought it unlikely that all permissions granted to financial firms would be lost . 
    simon ainsworth , the senior vice-president at moody 's , said a scheme to harmonise regulations across the eu could provide an alternative way to access the single market . 
    `` the complexity of ( quickly ) unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on european domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most cross-border rights to undertake business , '' he 's basically arguing that it 's in everyone 's interest to minimize the impact of brexit on the financial sector . 
  contrast this with the view that frankfurt/paris/dublin have opportunities to attract significant operations away from london , and there 's a big disconnect somewhere . 
  it seems to me she still has choices in that case . 
  either comply with the local school regulations , and take her hijab off while on school grounds , or attend the school that 's further away . 
  she 's 22 years old ? 
  how has this suddenly become an issue for her ? 
  did she recently change school ? 
  should n't she have checked the school rules before she switched ? 
   i think i have the right [ to wear the hijab ] . 
  benlliure high is a public school and they make me feel like an oddball . 
  but why should i be an oddball ? 
  i hate to be the one to point this out , but if you 're the only person in the entire school wearing a hijab , you 're going to look like an oddball . 
  because if they just wanted to help the homeless or the hungry , there are plenty of existing organisations in which to do that . 
  bringing their banners to the ` pop up food bank ' is attention seeking ; posting about it on their website is attention seeking . 
  if they wanted to feed the homeless and the poor while asking nothing in return , they would do it discreetly and we would n't have heard about it . 
  basically , this is neofascists engaging in virtue-signalling . 
  they can give their food to whomever they want . 
  i 'm not sure they can set up a food distribution stand in a public place without permission though . 
  and once they ask for permission to provide a service , they have to explain why the service is available to ` whites only ' . 
  they want publicity and more recruits to their gang of thugs . 
  yes , but it happens more frequently in the us because the electoral schedules are more asychronous ( every 2 years for the house , every 4 years for president , one third of senate seats up every 2 years ) . 
  normally the popular mood in france favours the left or right for president and for the assembly at the same time . 
  in the us it 's more likely that the opposition can take control of the house/senate during a presidential term . 
  the national assembly is elected in a separate election , about a month after the presidential . 
  the next one is june of 2017 i think . 
  the assembly election also has a two-stage process . 
  the fn got 13.6 % of votes in the first round last time , and 3.66 % in the second round . 
  they ended up with only 2 seats whereas 3.7 % of seats would be about 21 or 22 . 
   hardly democratic though , is it ? 
  that depends on what you consider to be ` democratic ' . 
  if your chosen candidate does n't get through , a two-stage system gives you an opportunity to express another preference in the run off . 
  arguably that 's more sensitive to peoples ' preferences than a single-stage system . 
   if marine le pen gets 10 or 20 percent of the votes , her party should have 10 to 20 percent the representation , right ? 
  there 's only one president , so in the presidential it 's winner take all no matter how you organise voting . 
  i 'm wondering when the new labour party [ gang of four ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_%28uk%29 ) will make themselves known . 
  you do n't want to go to french prison . 
  thank fuck for two-stage electoral systems . 
  shift seems to have happened 2011-2012 , so before the racist attacks became news afaik . 
  most of what 's going on now , in the uk and the wider eu , is political posturing . 
  some tories are calling for a hard brexit , others are calling for a soft one . 
  some eu politicians are calling for the uk to be treated harshly , others are arguing for a sensible approach . 
  these are attempts to influence the initial position ( s ) in the forthcoming negotiations . 
  they should n't be taken too seriously . 
  cooler heads will prevail when the negotiations finally begin . 
  that 's what i heard . 
  demonstrations are mostly during apr-jun and sept-oct . outside of that it 's too inconvenient for one reason or another . 
  i 'm reading it !, 
  it 's good fun . 
  violent extremism - * so * hot right now . 
  ah fuck , does he do that ? 
  i hate it when people pronounce kenya that way . 
  martin has said that * les rois maudits * was one source of inspiration . 
  it 's a series of books telling the story of the capetian dynasty . 
   marxist uk , swiss and german banksters financing bolshevik revolution and being directly responsible for all that came afterwards ? 
  i find your ideas intriguing and i would very much like to subscribe to your newsletter . 
  america like the nato member is such a friend to eu ? 
  let 's put it this way : i 'm more confident that the us wishes good things for europe than i am that russia wishes good things for europe . 
  but maybe i 'm just biased by the history of the last few hundred years . 
  this is all coming out of left field to be honest . 
  is soros funded by the european parliament ?
