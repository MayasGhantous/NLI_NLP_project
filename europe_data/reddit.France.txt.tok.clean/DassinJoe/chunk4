  lol . 
  johnson the europhile-turned-brexiter for political purposes is accusing another politician of hypocrisy ? 
  goodness me . 
   they get support simply for their immigration stance the fn does n't just push anti-immigration buttons , although that remains the basis for their core support . 
  they also appeal to economic protectionists , `` law and order '' types , eu secessionists , and disaffected youth . 
  this broadened support is the main reason mlp can garner 30 % ; she 's toned down the xenophobia and focused on other issues . 
  even against hollande she would n't win . 
  a majority of people do n't trust her . 
  edit : lol , pointless argument . 
  oak-ay if yew insist . 
  if i can o-pine , they should bring back the birch !, 
  i do n't think the assumption is that they wo n't return , but rather that they could be in germany a long time . 
  rather than allowing * little syrias * to develop , the german government is encouraging dispersal and language acquisition . 
  seems reasonable to me . 
  syrian doctors , on the other hand , are in germany to stay . 
  foreign policy had an interesting piece last month . 
  edit : [ here 's the fp piece ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/07/syrian-doctors-are-saving-german-lives-problem-refugee-crisis/ ),

   until they are able to return to the country they are from . 
  that 's the big unknown though . 
  it could take a decade , during which time germany ca n't afford to ghettoize a huge number of people . 
  some bosnian refugees were in germany for six or seven years before being asked to return home . 
  mr spock , in the original series , he was a balkan right ? 
  why ? 
  for having a sense of humour ? 
   marseille and brussels are hot spots for this brussels ? 
  marseille had almost 1.2 million containers pass through in 2014 , let 's say 3200 per day . 
  they 'd need to search 200 containers per hour during a 16 hour day . 
  this means that every hour these 200 containers are accessible ( either on the ground or one level up ) . 
  every stack of containers has to be rearranged every hour or every two hours . 
  this requires cranes that should be otherwise employed loading and unloading ships . 
  it 's impossible to control every container entering a port that size .

  [ after brexit : how important would uk trade be to the eu ? 
  ] ( http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/after-brexit-how-important-would-uk-trade-be-eu#.vxdg7ezi890 )  we 'd still be far less important to the eu than they are to us -- the eu still takes about 45 percent of our exports , down from 55 percent at the turn of the century . 
   only for ireland and cyprus does the uk represent more than 10 percent of total ( including intra-eu ) exports . 
   eu exports to the uk would represent about 3 percent of eu gdp ; not negligible by any means , but equally perhaps not as dramatic as one might think . 
  so 45 % of uk exports depend on eu markets ; 16 % of eu exports depend on the uk market . 
  eu member states can find geographically proximate alternatives for trade ; the uk will have to factor in higher transportation costs for trade outside the eu . 
  edit : some similar points made [ here ] ( https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/02/here-is-why-brexiters-are-completely-wrong-on-trade/ ) and here 's a telegraph article : [ major blow for brexit campaign as us rules out uk-only trade deal ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11962277/major-blow-for-brexit-campaign-as-us-rules-out-uk-only-trade-deal.html ), 
  employment legislation :  the eu has had a massive influence over uk employment law rights . 
  the following were introduced by virtue of our membership of the eu , and are at risk if we leave or renegoniate our membership terms ( this is not an exhaustive list ) :  minimum paid annual leave ( now 28 days a year including bank holidays )  additional rights for agency and temporary workers and for part-time workers  current pregnancy and maternity leave rights  parental leave  working time ( which includes a maximum of a 48-hour week unless you agree otherwise , and minimum rest breaks each day )  equal pay  anti-discrimination rules on race , sex , disability , age and sexual orientation  data protection rights [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2013/jan/24/europe-legacy-uk-workplaces ), 
  i find it hard to separate them from economic and legal arguments . 
  obviously exit would increase uk sovereignty , as no laws would be passed on from the eu . 
  but i need to be convinced that there are so many problematic laws coming from the eu . 
  when i look [ here ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/438402/eu-laws-that-cost-the-uk-a-fortune-and-achieve-nothing ) ( warning , it 's the express ) at the list of `` crazy laws that cost the uk a fortune '' , i see the working time directive , various measures on energy and climate change , and the temporary agency workers ' directive . 
  personally , i 'm in favour of increased protections for workers and action on climate change , so maybe i 'm not the best person to ask about sovereignty . 
  on democratic arguments , it 's a mixed bag . 
  membership of the eu has arguably had some benefits for uk democracy - nigel farage has never managed to be elected within england , yet he 's a high profile politician because he 's been elected to the european parliament . 
  there 's no way that ukip would have the profile that it does today without the european parliament . 
  we hear a lot about the ` democratic deficit ' of the eu , mainly because the parliament has limited powers and the commission has quite extensive powers . 
  but the makeup of the commission is determined by the governments of member states , who in turn are selected by the people . 
  it 's not too far removed from the 2nd chambers of many european democracies . 
  yes i did , because these are the arguments i 'm comfortable with . 
  if i look at the `` better off out '' campaigns other top reasons : * freedom to control our national borders . 
  currently eu migrants can enter britain if they have the means to support themselves . 
  they ca n't simply show up and start claiming welfare , but they may become a net burden on the state if , for example , a family of four arrives and only earns 25k sterling . 
  from the research i 've seen , eu migrants are net contributors to the uk economy , but there 's very little research out there . 
  * freedom to restore britain 's special legal system . 
  afaik britain still has its special legal system . 
  the only difference is that eu law can take precedence over national law . 
  this is n't necessarily a bad thing . 
  * freedom to deregulate the eu 's costly mass of laws . 
  there 's an implicit assumption that the eu makes laws unnecessarily , and all of these laws can be done away with post exit . 
  however , there 's very little concrete information about what laws will be done away with , so i 'm reluctant to say this is a strong argument . 
  * freedom to restore british customs and traditions .

  [ fact sheet on dirty bombs ] ( http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/fs-dirty-bombs.html ) from the nuclear regulatory commission . 
  [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dirty_bomb ) it seems that the material with low radioactivity wo n't have much effect ( less dangerous than a conventional bomb ) , wheres the material with high radioactivity would have to be shielded so much that it would not disperse effectively . 
  there are many indications this gang was investigating possibilities to make a dirty bomb . 
  [ this wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dirty_bomb ) suggests that it 's a bit of a waste of time . 
   the exact same thing can be said about the be-remainers . 
  no , the be-remainers are arguing for the status quo , so they can present factual arguments about the current context . 
  however , these facts are pretty boring and have less emotional appeal . 
  the be-remainers can appeal to fear of change or fear of economic disruption , but it 's a negative play on emotions , rather than the ( mostly ) positive ones available to the leave campaign . 
  not all , but many of them . 
  edit : these are the economic arguments put forward by the `` better off out '' campaign ( excerpted from their list of 10 reasons to vote out ) : * freedom to make stronger trade deals with other nations . 
  -- hypothetical . 
  * freedom to spend uk resources presently through eu membership in the uk to the advantage of our citizens . 
  -- yes . 
  about 8.5 billion or 0.5 % of uk gdp . 
  * freedom to make major savings for british consumers . 
  -- hypothetical . 
  * freedom to improve the british economy and generate more jobs . 
  -- hypothetical . 
  * freedom to regenerate britain 's fisheries . 
  -- hypothetical . 
  * freedom to save the nhs from eu threats to undermine it by harmonising healthcare across the eu , and to reduce welfare payments to non-uk eu citizens . 
  -- not sure the nhs is threatened , but yes to the point on welfare payments . 
  out of six economic reasons to leave , four are hypothetical . 
  i was wondering if that was a swedish version of the fbi , but i guess from your response that it 's the us one . 
  i wonder does this mean the fbi contacted the swedish police after identifying him as a potential seller of ricin ( or whatever ) . 
  or risk aversion ( remain ) versus impetuousness ( leave ) . 
  the argument for staying is economically sound but ultimately quite boring . 
  the argument for leaving can appeal to adventurism , independence of spirit , and patriotism , as well as to some less savoury emotions .
