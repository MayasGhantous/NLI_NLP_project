   wednesday meaning first fast ... and friday being late fast . 
  i thought friday in irish ( aoine ) was based on [ the word for fasting ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aoine#irish ) due to the tradition of fasting on fridays ? 
  it seems to have a latin root , [ ieiunus ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ieiunus#latin ) but i do n't see the association with venus ? 
  edit : i misinterpreted due to poor colouring on the map . 
  impossible to distinguish the outline of the country from the colour for `` day of fasting '' , and the weird border between the gaeltacht and the rest of ireland is confusing . 
   they 're signaling membership in a group engaging in ~ ~ virtue ~ ~ moronity signalling . 
  they 've been heavily involved in the `` grow house '' trend in the uk and ireland , afaik . 
   you 're paid to sleep . 
  same thing in the military . 
  yep , same for cabin crew in airlines , and tech support people who have to be contactable 24/7 . 
  that is no country for old men . 
  interesting , from his ` pedigree ' i learn that his : father died at 62 years grandfather died at 61 years great-grandfather died at 48 years great-great-grandfather died at 68 years schonborn is doing quite well considering his below average/average-aged lineage , but another 30 years ? 
  yeah it 's sort of the opposite of a dictatorship . 
  european parties who have a problem with the eu get money from the eu . 
  so long as they spend it on their eu-related activities , they 're fine .

   he could be expected to have a further 30 years . 
  bit excessive - the royals/aristos have been pampered since birth ; this guy 's only been pampered since about 1975 . 
  i notice people who begin observations with catch-all phrases like `` you people '' or `` those people '' will often come out with generalizations they ca n't defend . 
  what do you mean `` you people '' ? 
  who am i ? 
  who are these other people you associate me with ? 
  here , i 'll back up my statement : the national front claims to be a patriotic organisation yet it takes loans ( funds ) from a foreign power . 
  you can suck putin 's cock if you want to , but do n't pretend there 's nothing defective about the national front .

  the issue is parties using european funds to promote local interests . 
  for example , the fn appears to have used money from europe to pay people who are working for the fn inside france on local french issues . 
  this is not allowed . 
   unfortunately you clueless idiots can not get your head around people wanting to run their own country . 
  your view is we must accept what the eu gives us regardless of the social or political cost because economy . 
  lol , i simply pointed out he 's a third-generation brit . 
  you 're bringing your own drama into this thread . 
  goodbye . 
  on the internet nobody knows you 're a pony . 
  always amazed at how many high ranking us officials ( ex-officials ) have weak protection on their e-mails . 
   i 've never even seen that show yeah right , brony . 
  not sure how much credence to give this guy . 
  he [ quit before the brexit vote ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-saw-picture-drowned-8193892 ) ; now it sounds like he 's just attention seeking . 
   he 's indian ( a non eu country ) .

  he must have got an early view at the conclusion and therefore announced his resignation from westminster before the report was published . 
  delusional optimism . 
  my kids are very fond of dahl . 
  afaik his books are still widely read . 
  should suit the uk electorate . 
  next ge is in 2020 , so end of talks in 2019 gives plenty of time for extensive and widespread involvement in the political debate , a critical evaluation of the political parties , a rigorous exchange of ideas , followed by considered , informed , and mature decisions by the electorate on how to cast their ballots for the next parliament . 
  i think you missed my point . 
  there 's a claim that the tories are trying to rig the system ; i 'm saying it should be easy enough to simulate the different options to see how likely it is that the distribution has been rigged . 
  well yes , but only in parigi . 
   but where were they ? 
  the guardian found none at place de la r\u00e9publique where , as always , there were plenty of cigarette butts on the pavement . 
  jaysus the grauniad has plenty of spare time on its hands to be going looking for civility cops . 
   this became more prevalent by the end of the 18th century when groups such as the `` spalpeens '' spalpeen ( spailp\u00edn ) is often used in ireland as a derogatory term . 
   by this measure , france is the world leader in anti-vaccine beliefs . 
  well okay , but it 's not a good measure . 
  this is assessing suspicion about vaccine , but something like [ this map ] ( http://www.cfr.org/interactives/gh_vaccine_map/#map ) gives a much better idea of the extent and impact of anti-vaccine belief . 
   it 's written just fine . 
  it reads like it 's written by a teenager . 
  here 's [ some data ] ( http://invs.santepubliquefrance.fr/en/content/download/59988/240241/version/2/file/plaquette_assessment_vaccination_coverage_france_current_sources_data.pdf ) on vaccination coverage in france ( pdf format ) . 
  childrens ' vaccinations are around the 90 % level except hep b ( not obligatory ) and hpv ( relatively new ) . 
  i should have clarified it 's a literal translation ( transposition ) rather than a euphemistic one . 
   it 's an adjective related to volk . 
  i should have clarified it 's a literal translation ( transposition ) rather than a euphemistic one . 
  the closest english translation i can think of is `` folksy '' , which is not at all stigmatised .

  [ opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polls_about_9/11_conspiracy_theories ) there 's a lot of conspiracy nonsense about : ** newsweek poll in us : ** * do you think members of the bush administration are telling the truth * oct 2006 responses : 16 % said `` telling the truth '' , 53 % said they are `` mostly telling the truth but hiding something '' , 28 % said they are `` mostly lying '' , 3 % not sure . 
  ** canada : ** in september 2006 , an ipsos-reid poll found that 22 percent of canadians believe `` the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , had nothing to do with osama bin laden and were actually a plot by influential americans . '', 
  a september 2008 angus reid poll showed that 39 percent of respondents either disagree or are unsure that al-qaeda carried out the attacks . 
  about a third of those surveyed believed the u.s. government allowed the attacks to happen and 16 percent believe the u.s. government made the attacks happen . 
  ** germany : ** 23 percent said the u.s. government were responsible ** russia ** : 15 percent said the u.s. government were responsible, 
   you 're being a bit reductionist . 
  well yeah . 
  that 's why i wrote   * at a very simple level * they are correct obviously it 's reductionist . 
   i 'll put most of this down to the western european instinct to blame islamic terrorist attacks on anybody other than the people who actually carried them out . 
  oh right you are so . 
  at a very simple level they are correct : about three pages of the congressional report are still unavailable . 
  the 27 pages about saudi involvement that were held back until earlier this year had so many paragraphs blacked out that the total is about 3 pages worth .

  possibly gare de lyon , which is a couple of kilometres from notre dame . 
   that is irrelevant to the point under discussion perhaps , but your original statement misleadingly suggested that norway pays tariffs on everything , whereas the reality is that it 's a specific protectionist policy ( food security ) that distinguishes norway 's arrangement . 
   some eea members , e.g. , norway , must already pay tariffs , as we must when we export to norway . 
  only on fish and agricultural products because these are not covered by the eea . 
  other exports/imports are without tariffs . 
   the hubris of western leaders thinking they can control culture and shape religions is astounding . 
  ...  look at christianity .
