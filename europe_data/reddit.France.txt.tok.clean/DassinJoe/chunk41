  we did n't try to change it . 
  henry viii made himself head of the church in england . 
  european history is full of overlaps between religion and the state . 
  amsterdam is # 9 in the hottest cities and # 9 in the coldest cities . 
  it really does have something for everyone !, 
  merci !, 
  but it 's not really me !, 
  here 's some [ photos of what they look like ] ( http://bashny.net/t/en/291239 ) . 
  have recently been seen on a beach in sydney , apparently . 
  reminiscent of green tribbles . 
  `` vauxhall '' is disguised opel . 
  rolls royce is owned by bmw as well . 
  it 's about 100 metres distance but across the river . 
   northern irish people do n't get the choice . 
  there 's no `` british '' team in rugby , except for the lions which is a touring team made up of players from england , ireland , scotland , and wales . 
  it travels every four years . 
  the rugby unions have never been separate in ireland ; there was a single football association up until partition in 1921 . 
  due to a dispute over a match venue , the association split into the ifa and fai , with both organizations claiming to represent the entire country and selecting players from the entire country . 
  eventually in the 50s they settled down into `` northern ireland '' and `` republic of ireland '' . 
  wikipedia has a [ good summary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_football_association#north.2fsouth_split_and_the_foundation_of_the_football_association_of_ireland ) of the craziness . 
   roasts used to be a very culturally significant thing in england yeah it 's because it was perceived as the most popular way to cook beef ( and other meats ) . 
  funnily enough , if i enter `` pourquoi les anglais ... '' in google search the overwhelming question is about the side of the road you drive on - appears 4 times out of the top 10 questions . 
    and 99 % of them are peaceful  source ? 
  polls suggest otherwise . 
  what people say and what people do are two different things . 
  there are 1.6 billion muslims in the world . 
  if even 10 % of them were n't peaceful , the world would be a much scarier place . 
   ** brexit architect ** and united kingdom independence party mep nigel farage til that an architect is someone who says `` let 's do this thing '' , while leaving the actual design to other people . 
  this is so members of the tactical squad ca n't be identified . 
  nasty fucker - trips a guy with a kid , so that guy falls on the kid , then tries kicking/tripping a couple of other kids . 
  i hope she gets jail time . 
  there 's no excuse for this shit while she 's supposed to be reporting on the situation . 
  true enough , but they 've a lot of work to do if they want to have a good story to tell to voters in 2020 . 
  it 's almost like a slow reveal in a novel or television series . 
  what do we know so far ? 
  * no 2nd referendum , no parliamentary vote . 
  * the next uk general election is 7 may 2020 . 
  i think by this time the tories need to have worked out the deal . 
  ideally article 50 should be triggered by early 2018 at the latest , in order to give them the two-year lead before the next ge . 
  * there will be limits on migration ; this is a firm commitment . 
  * may is not in favour of a points-based system because it 's not controllable enough . 
  * there 's significant pressure to stay in the single market . 
  i think may is correct in not triggering article 50 until she has a clear idea of what brexit will look like . 
  however , she ca n't delay indefinitely or her own party will revolt and , ultimately , the tories will suffer at the polls . 
  her challenge is to find a deal that gives the uk most of the single market benefits , while allowing for some caps on intra-eu migration . 
  other people have mentioned the liechtenstein deal ( [ protocol 15 ] ( http://www.efta.int/sites/default/files/documents/legal-texts/eea/the-eea-agreement/protocols%20to%20the%20agreement/protocol15.pdf ) ) as a possible model . 
  it looks like liechtenstein migration in 2015 was about 5 persons per 1000 of population ; i assume this fits with the protocol . 
  but if this rate was applied to the uk , the total would be 320000 persons , which exceeds the total migration ( 270k persons ) from eu countries in 2015 . 
   most rt news when it 's to do with the uk ... is actually true ** most ** of the news that a news broadcaster relays is true ? 
  are we talking 60 % or 90 % ? 
  either way , should n't they be held to a normal standard ( all news is substantiated ) ? 
  but in that case the eu is choosing the brexit terms , which is exactly what may is trying to avoid . 
  event : worst footwear in the entire world 2016 contest . 
  ** theresa may 's ministers are carefully avoiding specific answers . 
  but she is systematically disowning many of the brexiteers ' promises ** sep 7th 2016 some 77 days have passed since britain voted on june 23rd to leave the european union . 
  yet this period has been strangely reminiscent of 77 years ago , after neville chamberlain declared war on nazi germany : a phoney war . 
  theresa may , the prime minister , has created a new department for exiting the eu and put three leading brexiteers ( pictured ) in charge of the process . 
  but little else has happened . 
  article 50 of the eu treaty , which would kick off negotiations , has not been invoked . 
  and mrs may 's phrase that `` brexit means brexit '' has become a tired clich\u00e9 . 
  david davis , secretary of state for the new department , had another go in parliament on september 5th . 
  brexit , he explained helpfully , meant leaving the eu . 
  he added that this implied taking back control of borders , laws and taxpayers ' money . 
  he brimmed with cheer about the opportunities it would bring . 
  yet when asked specific questions -- would britain quit the eu 's single market ? 
  what migration controls would it seek ? 
  would it stay in europol ? 
  when would negotiations start ? -- he gave only vague answers . 
  that may be quite sensible , for a reason he also offered : that it is more important to get brexit right than to do it quickly . 
  his department is a work in progress . 
  he has 180 officials and a further 120 in brussels , but he needs more . 
  as he spoke , he was flanked by his two brexiteer colleagues , boris johnson as foreign secretary and liam fox at the department for international trade . 
  the three men have been having the usual turf wars and squabbles over exactly what brexit should entail . 
  tellingly , two hints at answers emerged this week in asia , not westminster . 
  in china for the g20 summit , mrs may disavowed several pledges made by brexiteers before the referendum . 
  she said she was against an australian-style `` points '' system for eu migrants ( though mainly because it might let in too many , not too few ) . 
  she refused to back leavers ' promises to transfer saved eu budget payments to the national health service or scrap vat on fuel bills . 
  the not-so-subtle message was that , though the three brexiteers may be nominally in charge , the real decisions will be taken by her and by philip hammond , her chancellor , both of them remainers . 
  these two may have welcomed a second asian intervention : the unusual publication by japan 's foreign ministry of a brexit paper . 
  japanese companies , it said , were huge employers in britain , which took almost half of japan 's investment in the eu last year . 
  most of that came because britain is a gateway to europe . 
  the paper advised mrs may to try to retain full access to the single market , to avoid customs controls on exports , to preserve the `` passport '' that allows banks based in london to trade across europe and to let employers freely hire eu nationals . 
  these interventions worry tory brexiteers , who fret that having won a famous victory in june , they could lose the war . 
  their fear is that , given the choice , mrs may and mr hammond will lean more to staying in the single market than to taking back full control of migration , money and laws . 
  mr davis said this week that having access to the single market was not the same as being a member of it , and added that giving up border control to secure membership was an `` improbable '' outcome . 
  but he was slapped down when mrs may 's spokeswoman said the remark was only mr davis 's personal opinion . 
  he also talked of retaining as much of the status quo as possible , not least in areas like security and foreign-policy co-operation . 
  the case for staying in the single market is simple : economists say this will minimise the economic damage from brexit . 
  a `` hard '' brexit that involves leaving the single market without comprehensive free-trade deals with the eu and third countries would mean a bigger drop in investment and output . 
  brexiteers claim that many countries want free-trade deals and the economy is proving more robust than remainers forecast . 
  michael gove , a leading brexiteer and former justice secretary , scoffed that soi-disant experts predicting economic doom had `` oeuf on their face '' . 
  yet mrs may is less complacent , acknowledging that it will not be `` plain sailing '' for the economy . 
  domestic business and financial lobbies are pressing to stay in the single market . 
  as for trade deals , although she won warm words at the g20 summit from australia 's prime minister , malcolm turnbull , she was told firmly by barack obama and others that bilateral deals with britain would not be a priority . 
  the climate for free-trade deals is not propitious these days , and mr fox 's department is bereft of experienced trade negotiators . 
  mrs may has ruled out an early election and a second referendum . 
  she refuses to provide a `` running commentary '' on her brexit plans . 
  and she insists she can invoke article 50 without a parliamentary vote . 
  yet she is being urged by some to delay , since it would set a two-year deadline for brexit that can be extended only by unanimity among eu leaders . 
  in a thoughtful paper for the think-tank open europe , andrew tyrie , chairman of the treasury committee , says the government should first decide what sort of brexit it wants , adding that its leverage is greater before it pulls the trigger .
