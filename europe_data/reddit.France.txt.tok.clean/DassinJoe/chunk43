  but you 've got to allow for some fluidity in the latter : e.g. 
  immigration to britain from the caribbean peaked in the 1950s . 
  if those people had kids in the late 50s , those kids could have had kids in the early 80s , and they could have had kids in the 00s . 
  four generations on , these kids are as british as boris johnson , imo . 
   the documents show that usman spoke only urdu , while haddadi spoke mostly arabic . 
  a `` syrian '' who spoke only urdu ... 
  strange that this did n't ring any alarm bells for the greek authorities . 
  old irish `` linn '' also meant pool or body of water . 
  from this we get dublin ( dubh linn , or dark pool ) . 
  it 's waving at us !!!, 
  [ cazeneuve promised last week that it will be closed . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/france-vows-to-dismantle-jungle-refugee-camp-calais ), 
   besides , this principle is not absolute , no , but if it is to remain a principle at all it should be defended . 
  it has been there since the coal and steel community . 
  over the years there have been exceptions , but they must remain exceptions if free movement is to remain a principle ( pillar ) of the eu . 
  liechtenstein 's quota is subject to review every five years , iirc . 
  it was granted based on the specific characteristics of the place ( tiny , small population ) . 
  i 'm not sure how the liechtenstein case could be extended to the uk . 
   however if may is seen as backsliding on brexit they will be back and more powerful than she can possibly imagine . 
  very dramatic !, 
  i reckon they 'll be back , and with reinforced support , but they 're still going to be a bunch of unruly political amateurs . 
  for better or worse , ukip never managed to become a well-run political organisation , and at present it does n't look like it ever will . 
  along with the bbc , the daily mail , reuters , etc. 
  you 're the only one who interprets what she said as being `` the brexit process wo n't be plain sailing '' rather than `` it wo n't all be plain sailing for the economy during the brexit processs '' . 
  natural language is not so rigid as to exclude may 's usage of plain sailing to describe future economic conditions . 
  take it to the bbc . 
  i understand your position , i just do n't agree with it , and nor do any of the news services that i 've consulted . 
  you said the bbc is the only source that matters . 
  the bbc states  the prime minister has said `` it wo n't be plain sailing '' for the economy will you lodge a complaint with them ? 
  or tell them the author of the piece has poor reading comprehension ? 
  you mean the comments where you repeatedly claimed may was n't referring to the economy when she said it wo n't be plain sailing ? 
  lol . 
   i thought she was already sainted by the vatican . 
  beatified in 2003 . 
  there 's usually a period between beatification and canonization . 
   the fact that bbc did not choose that angle http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37269916 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37266626 makes it indeed case closed , since that 's the only establishment that has a set of editorial guidelines it has to abide by . 
  from your second bbc link :  the prime minister has said `` it wo n't be plain sailing '' for the economy i 'm left to conclude that you now agree she was referring to the economy , and you confirm that it 's case closed because the bbc has a set of editorial guidelines . 
  you challenged my reading comprehension , i offered a wide range of uk and international sources that give the same interpretation . 
  i did n't find any sources to back up a different interpretation , nor have you offered any . 
  case closed from what i can see . 
  google search on the words [ `` we 've seen figures giving some different messages in relation to the economy at the moment . 
  '' ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=we%27ve+seen+figures+giving+some+different+messages+in+relation+to+the+economy+at+the+moment.&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=hu7mv87pdukcgaarkqfwbg ) the international and uk press overwhelmingly interpret her words as being concerned with the economy : reuters : uk economy will suffer after brexit vote : british pm may daily mail : british pm may : uk economy will suffer after brexit vote mirror : prime minister theresa may warns of ` difficult times ahead ' for uk economy following brexit indian express : uk economy will suffer after brexit vote , says pm theresa may straits times : british pm theresa may says britain 's economy will suffer after brexit jpost : british pm may : uk economy will suffer after brexit vote, 
  `` we 've seen figures giving some different messages in relation to ** the economy ** at the moment . 
  i think the reaction of ** the economy ** has been better than some had predicted post - the referendum , but i wo n't pretend it 's going to be all plain sailing , '' may told reporters . 
  she 's referring to the economy . 
  maybe your definition of plain sailing does n't suit the usage , but you 'd have to take that up with her . 
  drop the personal attacks . 
  she 's clearly talking about how the economy will perform in the future . 
  you generally do n't want all hands on deck during a major storm . 
  the more people on deck , the more likely one will get washed overboard . 
  let 's paraphrase may : * the economy has n't done as poorly as some people suggested it might , but it wo n't all be smooth and/or easy . 
  there are difficult times ahead . 
  * happy with that one ? 
  it 's using your definition . 
  it means the boat will be affected adversely in some way , generally by bad weather . 
  maybe the boat will be damaged , maybe it will be delayed , maybe it will be blown off course . 
  maybe the passengers will be seasick . 
  it 's not the same as saying `` we need all hands on deck '' , though that may be a consequence ( it wo n't be plain sailing , therefore we need all hands on deck to mitigate the problems ) . 
  imagine if a doctor said : `` your health has been better recently than the tests three months ago would have indicated , but i wo n't pretend it 's going to be all plain sailing . 
  there will be difficult times ahead . '', 
  would you be reassured or nervous ? 
  i declare christopher hitchens a great writer . 
  it 's entirely clear that she 's speaking about the economy . 
  this is the full quotation :  `` we 've seen figures giving some different messages in relation to the economy at the moment . 
  i think the reaction of the economy has been better than some had predicted post - the referendum , but i wo n't pretend it 's going to be all plain sailing , '' may told reporters . 
   which is absolutely meaningless , since camerons beloved `` reforms '' we 're nothing of consequence . 
  do n't be so hard on yourselves . 
  both before and after the reforms you 're good enough , you 're smart enough , and doggone it people like you . 
   `` i wo n't pretend it 's going to be all plain sailing , '' may told reporters . 
   `` there will be difficult times ahead , '' she added . 
  seems pretty clear to me . 
   in what universe am i supposed to see this as a band thing ? 
  the blues brothers universe , with teresa may as elwood and boris johnson as jake . 
  looks like you 've won this round mr mittens !, 
  here 's [ the historical reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/splendid_isolation ) :  `` splendid isolation '' is a diplomatic policy of avoiding alliances and entanglements . 
   get the benefits of an eu passport the right to find work in another country makes it well worth it imo . 
  if it 's just for traveling , it 's probably not worth the effort . 
   it 's almost an insult to the whole good friday agreement . 
  i think it 's very much in the spirit of the gfa . 
  overall a competent leader but possibly unable to delegate . 
  no eu , no special relationship , so perhaps the leader for a new era of splendid isolation ? 
  i 'm not saying she 's wrong to push for this , just that it 's entirely to be expected given the forthcoming constitutional change . 
  same as sinn fein will push for a poll on irish unification . 
  cameron 's a complete failure ; sturgeon still has a reputation to protect . 
   i do n't need constitutional changes to argue that my nation should be independent . 
  that 's fair enough , but the snp was fairly clear in the run up to the last referendum that they considered it a ` once in a generation ' issue unless there was a substantial change . 
  reminds me of this foolishness : [ bt loses hyperlink patent case ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/article/bt-loses-hyperlink-patent-case/ ) the article is alarmist in the extreme . 
  unenforceable `` taxes '' are pointless ; the legislation may be a bad idea , but it 's not going to result in my paying a tax on every link i tweet . 
  ^ anyway , ^ the ^ twitter ^ account ^ is ^ in ^ my ^ cat 's ^ name ^ and ^ he ^ does n't ^ have ^ any ^ income . 
  france has offered to house them for years , but only if they were prepared to move away from calais and apply for asylum in france . 
  to put it more simply , you choose to believe the tories but you advise nobody believe the snp . 
   our politicians have made it pretty clear  ... suck up everything that the snp says lol, 
   ask nicola sturgeon . 
  well yeah , but when you 're a scots nationalist , every constitutional change in the uk looks like an opportunity to put scots independence back on the table . 
  all those educated since 2003 to return to school to learn and be tested on the imperial system . 
  i think this article is a misinterpretation of what was said . 
  may 's spokeswoman was clarifying that the uk wo n't have the same deal as switzerland or as norway , i.e. 
  the deal that is worked out will be customised to the uk . 
   the model we are seeking is one unique to the united kingdom this is not the same as saying `` we want to end free movement but keep unfettered access to the single market '' . 
   a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services a zero or low tariff agreement will satisfy this .
