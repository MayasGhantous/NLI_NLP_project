  some similarities but also some differences : [ crimean -- congo hemorrhagic fever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean%e2%80%93congo_hemorrhagic_fever ), 
  there 's [ an economist article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21706348-dire-prophecies-doom-have-not-come-trueyet-economy-slowing-fact-and-fiction?fsrc=rss ) also posted here that indicates wages and employment are down , while inflation is up . 
  but to be honest , it 's too early to say anything definitive . 
  it wo n't be clear until jan/feb what the immediate after effects of the vote have been . 
  edit : i 've been reminded to copy/paste because it 's the economist . 
  here 's the relevant part :  data from adzuna , a job-search firm , show that in july wages and vacancies fell compared with june . 
  ( a higher rate of inflation linked to the weak pound is eating further into real earnings . ), 
  the number of advertised low-paid and contract roles has grown , as employers seek to plug gaps without committing to permanent hires . 
  the economist 's model analysing google searches for `` jobseekers '' , which is correlated with official unemployment back to 2004 , suggests that unemployment is now around 5.3 % , higher than the official rate of 4.9 % last recorded for april-june . 
  edit again : downvoted because i dared to discuss the situation and disagree with the `` everything is rosy in uk '' narrative ? 
  yeah fair enough . 
  i prefer the urban legend though . 
  ah okay , but gertrude is saying the queen in the play is exaggerating her feelings , not that she 's hiding them . 
   the united states has been having these types of drills for almost 20 years , ever since columbine really . 
  and before then there was [ duck and cover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikqxu-5jw60 ) , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duck_and_cover ), 
  are you planning to return home to start up a new business ? 
   i think people here expected yeah , there 's a ghoulish element to some of this reporting . 
  in reality things are chugging along much as normal , albeit with a somewhat greater military presence . 
  it 's a joke mate . 
  jaysus , do n't bother with all this hashtagging nonsense . 
  just organise a few unscheduled power cuts . 
  job done . 
  dropped my kids off this morning . 
  fucking bullshit arrangements at the primary school with hordes of adults hanging out in front trying to figure out what class their child is in . 
  the unfortunate 6 year olds , many of whom are knee-high to a grasshopper , had to run the gamut of a crowd of towering adults to get into the school grounds . 
  what a great experience for the first day of formal schooling . 
  in contrast , dropping the eldest at coll\u00e8ge ( 11 years and up ) was relaxed and pleasant , even though at that age the kids can deal more effectively . 
  i 'm no child psychologist , but it seems to me the whole thing was arse backwards : every effort should have been made to assist the little ones and make the first day as pleasant as possible , while the older ones can be allowed to just get on with it . 
  what about the lads who stole the tank and drove it to syria ? 
   what was that line from shakespeare ? 
  `` the lady doth protest too much , methinks '' this is queen gertrude replying to hamlet when he asks her what she thinks of the play he has had staged . 
  she 's saying that the ( stage ) queen is too ardent toward her husband . 
  her `` protest '' is her avowals of love towards her husband and claims that she 'll never remarry . 
  i 'm not sure of the relevance here ? 
   player queen :  both here and hence pursue me lasting strife ,  if once i be a widow , ever i be a wife !, 
   player king :  ` tis deeply sworn . 
  sweet , leave me here a while ,  my spirits grow dull , and fain i would beguile  the tedious day with sleep . 
   player queen :  sleep rock thy brain ,  and never come mischance between us twain !, 
   hamlet :  madam , how like you this play ? 
   queen :  the lady doth protest too much , methinks . 
  i have n't spent a lot of time thinking about it to be honest , but if a peace agreement is reached in two years ' time , then i 'd expect two years after that could be ` safe-for-deporting conditions ' . 
  so yeah why not ? 
  the bosnian conflict ended in 1995 , and [ this article ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/world/9610/16/germany.bosnia.refugees/ ) indicates that germany started repatriating people in 1996 . 
   the propaganda war continues . 
  delegitimizing the result of the referendum is thought to be the way to persuade parliament to override it . 
  no , that 's not what this report is about . 
  the electoral reform society has been around for over 130 years . 
  it conducts research into elections in the uk and reports on them . 
  in this case , it has criticized both sides of the referendum debate . 
  in fact , the report is arguing for a better framework for referendums in the uk , something that would benefit everyone and might , for example , make referendum results legally binding . 
  land/birthplace can exert an illogical pull on people . 
   if they 've already acquired asylum in germany . 
  i think by definition they will no longer have asylum if peace is established in syria . 
  they may have acquired citizenship , but i presume that takes at least 5 years ? 
   le pen compared herself to trump , observing that both of them have waged iconoclastic campaigns against their country 's political `` establishment . '', 
   `` we are similar because we are not part of the establishment , we are not part of the system , and we do not depend on anybody and we do n't take orders from anyone , '' she said . 
  i 'll accept that trump is not part of the political establishment , but let 's consider mlp : * second generation politician * inherited leadership of party from her father * joined party in 1986 at age 18 * has been employed full time by the party since 1998 not part of the establishment my arse . 
  excellent initiative . 
  there will be so much to do in syria when peace finally breaks out . 
   not sure why the eu needs to be involved in the funding . 
  simply because it 's an eu program . 
   opposing positions in a democracy are not to be feared , they are the normal necessary conditions for a democracy . 
  empirically , it is rare and unusual in a representative democracy to have a 1st minister and deputy 1st minister whose positions are diametrically opposed on a major issue ; this is not a ` normal necessary condition ' by any stretch . 
   i do n't accept that any of these things are beyond the wit of man . 
  i 'm not saying they are , and people of good will should find a way to persevere . 
  but there 's some distance to travel from `` brexit has no bearing on the peace process '' to `` all of these issues can be overcome '' . 
  there 's a significant amount of work to do if things are to be kept on track , and i think it 's a mistake to be blas\u00e9 about the impact of brexit on ni . 
  true enough unfortunately . 
  i maybe should 've used / s when i wrote `` only 46 % '' . 
  it 's all so farcical tbh . 
  yep , ` fraid so . 
  i 'll be glad when silly season is over this year . 
  oh yes it does . 
  and it 's [ way more serious ] ( http://www.healthdictionary.info/frankfurt_marburg_syndrome_virus.htm ) . 
  they asked about burkinis and only 46 % of people want to ban them . 
  here 's a [ bit more detail from yougov ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/31/majority-public-backs-burka-ban/ ) . 
  it 's phrased `` to what extent would you support or oppose a law that bans people from wearing the burka in the uk ? '', 
  edit : here 's [ a pdf with even more statsy goodness ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/evirrw1hn5/internalresults_160825_burka_burkinis.pdf ) . 
  it turns out support for banning the burka has actually gone down since 2012 . 
  they also asked about burkinis , but only 46 % of people supported a ban, 
  this seems correct given that much of the exit campaign was fought on the issue of immigration . 
  but i guess it means that single market membership is off the table . 
   there is no reason why we should see brexit as something that undermines the peace process . 
  i can think of many reasons : * the reintroduction of ( some form of ) borders * the cessation or curtailment of the eu-funded ni peace program * the opposing positions on brexit held by the first and deputy first ministers in the assembly ( and , by extension , by their parties ) * the rejection of brexit by a majority of those who voted in ni ( 56 % ) * the general impact on the post gfa environment ( borders , legal basis , echr , ni constitution , cross-border cooperation , etc. ), 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.cooperationireland.org/media/2435/ccbs_ci-eu-referendum-briefing-paper-2.pdf ) and [ here ] ( http://crossborder.ie/site2015/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ccbs-cooperation-ireland-eu-referendum-briefing-paper-3.pdf ) for an overview . 
   it is sort of ironic that 100 years after the easter uprising , it is ireland that does not want the uk to separate itself . 
  plenty of irish people would be okay with britain separating itself if it left the six counties behind :-)  but we should not let scars from the troubles let us think that brexit has a connection to them . 
  no that 's wrong . 
  the aftermath of the brexit referendum , which did not pass in ni iirc , can fundamentally change the framework on which the good friday agreement was based . 
  the connection is there ; pretending that it does n't exist wo n't do anyone any favours . 
   even if the uk is not in the customs union , it still does not follow that the uk enforces customs borders . 
  if the uk ( unilaterally ) adopts a tariff free policy on all goods coming from ireland , then there is no reason for the uk to have a customs border . 
  a tariff free policy on all goods coming from ~ ~ ireland ~ ~ anywhere in the eu . 
   we should probably not exaggerate what it entails neither you nor i live in a border region ; many of those who do are seriously worried about the impact . 
  can we get the mexicans to pay for it ? 
   nobody wants a return to the borders of the past the borders of the past were military borders , at which british army snipers would train guns on my dad 's car while we waited to have our id checked . 
  nobody wants this again . 
  the borders of the future may be customs borders - enforced by both sides - if the uk does n't join some sort of customs union with the eu . 
  this is what may is referring to . 
  nice work !,
