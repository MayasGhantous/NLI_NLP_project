  from your own link :  well if you look ahead , what is going to happen , when the uk leaves the european union is that of course , ** here northern ireland will have a border with the republic of ireland ** , which will remain a member of the eu . 
  of course ireland does n't want a border ; the uk seems ambiguous to be honest . 
   the uk is not going to reintroduce border controls . 
  citation needed . 
   farmers and companies will just have to deal with customs then . 
  it 's going to kill a lot of economic activity in the area . 
  no , this was to her own cabinet . 
   yeah that 's bullshit and a really stupid thing to say . 
  explain why it is bullshit ? 
  if the uk reintroduces border controls in ni it will : * kill businesses in the border region * negate the good friday agreement , requiring some renegotiation * require a vote in both ni and roi on the renegotiated agreement this is a major change for ni/roi . 
  it throws everything into question . 
  i do n't get your point ? 
  without a customs union , there 'll be an economic border post-brexit . 
  yeah , but it does n't inspire much confidence that she has to keep repeating it . 
  she should get a plan on the table , that 'd help . 
   it will be a demonstration they did n't really mean what they said not just that , but also a demonstration that they do n't really care about ni , roi , or the peace process . 
   actually speak french ah fuck man , i wish someone had told me that 15 years ago . 
  i 've just been speaking at people in english and irish all this time , and then raising my voice when they look at me blankly . 
  maybe i 'll try actually speaking french next time i go out . 
  how many times has she said `` brexit means brexit '' at this point ? 
  i agree that the common travel area would simplify things for passenger vehicles , but what about cross-border trade ? 
  for example , there are lots of dairy farmers in ni who bring their milk to the republic for processing . 
  will they be allowed to continue this ? 
  i traveled frequently in the 1980s between roi and ni to visit family , and even with the common travel area there was a definite `` border '' . 
   i presume upon us leaving there will still be no hard between roi & ni . 
  i presume you mean no ` hard border ' ? 
  without a customs union , how will that work ? 
  it depends where you are . 
  in paris it 's difficult , outside of paris it 's easier . 
  web site of the castle : http://www.duartcastle.com/home it 's got a nice situation . 
  i moved from the 20th most friendly to the 56th !, 
  what the fuck was i thinking ? 
  ^ ^ so ^ ^ lonely ^ ^ just ^ ^ shoot ^ ^ me ^ ^ now, 
  i understand that literature is n't for everyone , but i do think people are missing something if they equate ` reading stuff on the internet ' with , for example , reading * the brothers karamazov * . 
  great works of literature are persistent in their cultural importance . 
   these are all professional politicians so i doubt they 're lying not sure if serious, 
  the linked storify content from historian mathilde larrere is interesting . 
  personally , i like [ olympia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olympia_%28manet%29#/media/file:edouard_manet_-_olympia_-_google_art_project.jpg ) as a figurehead . 
  story appears to have been pulled by cjnews.com - ca n't find it anymore . 
  maybe it was repeating old news ? 
  she said something about this in 2012 : http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/112684/marine-le-pen-calls-for-kippah-ban, 
  i saw a priest wearing a cassock earlier today . 
  wonder if le pen would ban them too ? 
  gosh , touchy much ? 
  people are clarifying the headline , which is the title of the post . 
  `` bavure polici\u00e8re '' ~ `` case of police brutaility '' is the best i can come up with, 
   in short , the eu will be doing what germany wants . 
  no , the eu will do what can be passed by the council , which is pretty much what 's always happened . 
  it wo n't be purely what germany wants , but a compromise between the ( elected ) ministers of the member states . 
  all the talk of a democratic deficit at eu level should be reduced to the sensible deficit at national ministerial level . 
   but i think its a shame so many of us have this ` us vs them ' mentality when it comes to our neighbours . 
  me too . 
  i do n't want the uk to leave the eu but i wish you guys success if/when you do . 
  this bitterness is silly between neighbours . 
   we british will suceed no matter what and i wish you every sucess . 
  hurling benefits from slo-mo replays more than most sports , imo . 
  fair play , i 'd buy that lad a beer . 
  you goddamned paparazzi !, 
  you follow me everywhere !, 
  any day spent hurting the feelings of trump supporters goes down as a good day in my book . 
  super chuffed with myself . 
  yes i 'm a native english speaker , but unlike you i can understand exactly what trump is doing and it 's akin to dog-whistle politics . 
  he makes a statement in the conditional , then adds `` i do n't know '' to distance himself from it . 
  it 's cowardly and it 's bullying and it 's deceitful . 
  he 's not prepared to take ownership of the things he says . 
  this bullshit of `` maybe < this thing  ... 
  i do n't know '' is a coward 's way to propose ideas without * really * standing behind the idea . 
  he was speaking about a post election context in which hilary had already won . 
  and i did n't attack you , though i get that your feelings might be hurt . 
  wow . 
  that 's some mental gymnastics right there . 
  he was speaking about a context * where clinton has already won * , where she gets to choose the justices . 
  yeah look at the aussies , ranked 4th , 4th , 6th , 8th since sidney in 2000 . 
  well yes , but it 's very poor behaviour for one candidate to call in advance for an elected opponent to be overthrown ( or shot , which is likely his intent ) . 
  lol . 
  your boy trump is a liability . 
  i did n't write `` xyz abc '' - donald trump that is , i did n't make a direct attribution . 
  i referred to trump 's `` blah blah blah '' , that is , i made an indirect attribution . 
  this is called paraphrasing , hence the ellipsis , so i refute your claim that i 'm a liar . 
   for me , it was pretty clear that he was talking about voting . 
  wtf does the second amendment have to do with voting ? 
  do you even know what he is referring to when he talks about the 2nd amendment people ? 
  cry me a river . 
  you know that trump is suggesting that gun nuts * could * shoot clinton . 
  you can split hairs over should/could , but his rhetoric has no place in a presidential race ; it 's indefensible . 
  you can complain that i 've misrepresented him somewhat , but it does n't change the fact that one candidate is suggesting his opponent could be shot . 
  you raise this as a problem without bothering to give me the correct quotation ? 
  wow that 's pretty useless . 
  here it is :  `` if she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do , folks , '' mr. trump said , as the crowd began to boo . 
  he quickly added : `` although the second amendment people -- maybe there is , i do n't know . '' explain to me how i have made him seem worse ? 
  bachelors in ireland - graduated with about 6k of debt in the 90s . 
  got a bursary for a masters in the uk so did n't add to debt but did n't pay anything off . 
  then once i got a job i paid down debt as fast as i could from my meagre salary . 
  felt great to make the final payment after a few years . 
  guess i 'm gon na have to replace my budgie smugglers with the big crucifix on the front . 
  not what i said , but i 'm lolling at your giving trump a pass . 
  the similarity is doublespeak , whether by an imam or trump . 
  no need to stretch for equivalencies i did n't make . 
   / u/iambeingserious  i was being half serious dude , this is too meta . 
  it 's making my head hurt .
