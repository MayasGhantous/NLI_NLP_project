  yeah i was thinking similar to trump and his `` maybe the 2nd amendment guys should ... 
  i do n't know ... '', 
  he is careful with his words though : `` one of the interpretations ... '' `` towards the end of times ... there will be wars ... and because of these wars ... '' he 's signalling to these kids that they 'll be able to keep female slaves if they sign up for the end of times jihad , but he 's careful to couch it in conditional or hypothetical terms . 
  the best charge might be conspiracy to recruit and/or engage in terrorist activities , but it will be difficult to prove . 
  i 'm guessing he 's a citizen as article says he was raised in uk . 
  he should be fired by the mosque though , and probably charged though i 'm not sure with what . 
  poor ~ ~ goats ~ ~ sheep . 
  ( imam is based in wales ), 
  am i failing some internet courage test ? 
  let me guess , you 're certified internet courageous . 
  booing athletes is crass , plain and simple . 
  ban all face coverings in public places , including guy fawkes masks ? 
  okay by me if it 's systematic , but protestors lose the possibility to remain anonymous . 
  they may be reputable , but they 're still * experts * ... 
  not much need for punctuation in the legal sector ? 
  join up with ireland !, 
  leaving the eu will have little impact on fishing communities , unless the uk govt abandons quotas altogether , in which case they 'll destroy uk fisheries over 10-15 years in a crazy free for all . 
  ditto the collieries : the eu is not the problem here , it 's the costs involved in extracting coal . 
  we 're left with nissan : i hope the factory stays , but i do n't see how brexit can be a welcome move for nissan . 
  i go into paris for work and almost never get hassled . 
  if i do , it 's by beggars . 
  the racailles do n't worry me . 
  yes i am worried about them but i do n't let them see that . 
  we still visit paris regularly . 
  italy wo n't be a ` casualty ' - renzi might be . 
  he had a security file , but i think he was considered low risk . 
  he condemned the shootings at the time . 
   in reality the risk is minimal . 
  one has more chance of dying in a car accident on our way to a concert or football match than in a terror attack . 
  this ca n't be emphasised too much . 
  the likelihood of being involved in an attack is vanishingly small . 
  also , we all die from something , so living in constant fear is pointless . 
  it 's not . 
  but if this is how they want to dress for swimming , they 're within their rights to do so . 
  i think it 's crazy , but i ca n't complain about a religion that tells women what to wear , while at the same time i 'm telling women what they can and ca n't wear . 
  voluntary sporting association . 
  poor kids . 
  seems the ceiling had polystyrene tiles which caught fire really fast and the fumes rapidly overcame the victims . 
  basements are scarily dangerous when something goes wrong . 
  i lived in lille for five years and this is one of the highlights of the year . 
  i disagree with the decision to close it . 
  edit : never mind - my misunderstanding . 
  i thought this story interesting coming as it does on the heels of the `` burkini '' outcry . 
  again , there 's a commercial issue here that is to be respected - the supermarket is n't licensed as a halal supermarket , it 's licensed as a general supermarket . 
  it needs to respect the terms of its license . 
   europe has the highest online piracy rates , by far europe has the highest online piracy rates , by farrrrrrrr ftfy, 
  turns out you are internationally known , 
  rob base ? 
   the uk police has killed exactly how many minority people in the uk during the past decade ? 
  not many - they 're detailed in the article . 
  the mark duggan killing is noteworthy as it sparked off riots in london and elsewhere . 
  it 's being hired by a sporting association . 
   basements and nearby homes were flooded my basement was flooded with wine while i was down there doing some woodworking . 
  my wife contacted the emergency services and they came to rescue me from the rising tide of wine . 
  but do n't worry , i managed to fight them off . 
  do n't take `` plonk '' as necessarily derogatory . 
  some people use it as a generic term for wine . 
  okay , that was funny . 
  hoping for some gregorian chant . 
  your perception is that they 've closed their open air aquatic park to the public , on a saturday , during one of the top 4/5 months of the year , without ** any ** guarantee of revenue , just a hope to sell tickets ? 
  do you have any evidence to support this ? 
  it sounds very unlikely . 
  i ca n't explain it any more . 
  if you have a jewish glee club , or a protestant wine tasting club , or a pastafarian rpg club , you can hire out a business premises for an event and ** only members of your club ** can attend the event . 
  the premises is yours for the day . 
  the business is not discriminating ; the club is discriminating . 
  it 's not like the gay wedding cake saga at all . 
  it 's not a burka day . 
  the water park agreed to privatise the park for the day . 
  they are not doing it for free . 
  ah here , we 're going full bloody circle . 
  the ** place of business ** is being booked out completely by a club . 
  the club has an exclusive membership policy . 
  the club is taking the entire place for a day . 
  i said this earlier :  it 's not the water park having a `` burkini day '' . 
  it 's the muslim women 's group booking the water park . 
  not sure how many ways this can be explained . 
   another of mr sankari 's friends , diya , said the united nations was also failing to protect the gay community in turkey . 
  i 'm sorry for his loss , but in fairness it should be up to the turkish government to protect the gay community in turkey . 
  what do you mean you ca n't ? 
  you set up a club and only invite white people to join . 
  if a non-white asks to join , you make up some excuse why they ca n't . 
  then you book the water park . 
   that 's actually not clear if they payed to book it . 
  yes it is . 
  you can buy tickets [ here ] ( https://www.billetweb.fr/smile13-a-speed-water ) . 
  if you have a `` whites only club '' then book the place . 
  it 's not the water park having a `` burkini day '' . 
  it 's the muslim women 's group booking the water park . 
  not sure how many ways this can be explained . 
   if they 're going with a female only thing , they should hire some female lifeguards , and dress as they want to , and in a more sporty way . 
  agreed . 
   ` terrorist diaspora ' implies that these terrorists are somehow being created in syria i think he 's referring to guys who want to be in syria to set up their caliphate nonsense but who will be pushed out eventually . 
  so they 'll lose their notional `` homeland '' when the caliphate falls , and come back to europe/elsewhere as terrorists . 
  i 'd be most worried about turkey tbh . 
  not quite sure what you 're trying to say , but if you go to the group 's facebook page ( linked from the article ) , it 's stated there that there will be male lifeguards on duty . 
  most water parks have a mix of lifeguards but probably not enough women to have only women lifeguards working that day . 
   they are both banning men and requiring burkinis . 
  male lifeguards on duty at the water park . 
  do you reckon they have water slides at this park ?
