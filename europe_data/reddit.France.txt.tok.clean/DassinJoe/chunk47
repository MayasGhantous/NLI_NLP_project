  like , er , slippery slopes ? 
   are you and / u/dassinjoe ok if i open a whites only pizza place ? 
  or a straight only pizza place ? 
  no because that 's just wrong . 
  there 's a difference between how associations are formed and how business are established . 
  afaik , you 'd be forbidden to set up a pizza place that serves only white people . 
  but , this waterpark is not banning males over the age of 11 . 
  the association is open to women and boys up to the age of 11 . 
  i do n't agree with this myself , but associations can make rules about membership . 
  the scouts d'europe continue to segregate boys and girls , for example , whereas the scouts de france have mixed troops . 
  i do n't know why the age of 11 is chosen , but it 's not my association and i do n't care that much . 
   you 're the one sticking up for shariah practices , why do n't you tell me ? 
  no , i 'm sticking up for a commercial arrangement between a group and a business . 
   do you like women getting raped and stoned to death ? 
  acid poured in their faces ? 
  kept as sex slaves ? 
  stop trying to bait me . 
  it 's disgusting . 
   this `` burkini '' shit is the tip of that iceberg . 
  if you are unaware of that , i suggest you look into islam more to know the true enemy of freedom . 
  this is a group of women choosing a dress code . 
  i disagree with their choice , but i still think they have the right to make that choice . 
  you 're the one who is opposing freedom of choice here , not me . 
  i 'm telling you that if you have the money to rent out a waterpark for a day , you can determine the dress code in the waterpark during that day . 
  have at it , knock yourself out . 
  happens all the time . 
   if a group of white people wan na organise a party and forbid black people ... then such a thing should be illegal . 
  alright , i 'm coming to your next party . 
  you 're legally obliged to invite me . 
  and i 'll arrive early and eat all the snacks . 
   the thing is they are forbiding any males from 11 and up . 
  there will be maitres nageur present according to their facebook page . 
  it 's for a single day for goodness sake . 
  why do you hate freedom ? 
   where did you read that a group of women booked it ? 
  seriously ? 
  like it 's right there on top of the comment you 're responding to . 
    a waterpark in france is ** to be booked out for one day to muslim women ** wanting to wear `` burkinis '' i 've highlighted the relevant part . 
   youre spreading misinformation . 
  you 're functionally illiterate . 
  i want the uk to get as close as possible to a free trade agreement , and most european interests will be served by keeping tariffs or barriers to an absolute minimum . 
  nevertheless , there wo n't be a customs union , and even with zero tariffs , the absence of a customs union will impose costs on importers and exporters on both sides . 
  this is the tragedy of brexit , from my point of view - even with the best will on both sides , the trade relationship becomes more costly and cumbersome , which negatively affects everyone . 
  if you had n't taken the first line out of context , it would make sense . 
   a ** community group ** in marseille arranged the day , giving access only to women wearing the all-over swimming garment . 
   the group was set up to `` encourage women to join in with ** the community ** '' . 
  what laws are being changed ? 
   this should be the top comment . 
  oh go on , have an upvote for that !, 
   why would it be a problem ? 
  just do n't look . 
  i do n't particularly care to be honest , but most european countries ban public nudity except in specific locations . 
  you need to take it up with the man . 
   the group 's claim that this is to `` encourage women to join in with the community '' is laughable . 
  ah for jaysus ' sake would you read the blinking article :  a ** community ** group in marseille arranged the day , giving access only to women wearing the all-over swimming garment . 
   the group was set up to `` encourage women to join in with ** the community ** '' . 
  it 's a muslim community group . 
  they want women to join in with their community , have a swim together , few laughs , maybe plan a ~ ~ bit ~ ~ ~ ~ of ~ ~ ~ ~ jihad ~ ~ day out together later in the year . 
  that 's next tuesday . 
  do n't worry , i 've booked you in . 
  it 's not a policy . 
  it 's a group hiring out a premises . 
  yeah i guess it depends on whether you can see into the place from the street . 
   a waterpark in france is to be booked out for one day to muslim women wanting to wear `` burkinis '' they 're hiring the place , let them wear rubber chickens on their heads for what difference it makes . 
  everyone just needs to fucking chill out a bit - if a group books out a resort , the group can set the dress code . 
  you probably could if you 're prepared to reserve the water park . 
  well , the budgie smugglers at least ; not sure what the local by-laws might be about nudity . 
  incarcerations have increased , you mean . 
  edit : how strange it is that you chose prison population , whereas from the same data source ( even listed on the same page ) you had actual details of `` crime '' rather than `` incarceration '' .

   sorry , i just ca n't keep it simple :( and yet you 're okay with the gold coins in the example ? 
  lol . 
  little bit over there , little bit over here ... 
  the main market for this is likely to be stag parties and groups of lads out on the town . 
  i doubt it 'll get much custom during the day time . 
  hookers and weed !, 
  my favourite !, 
   eh , not quite . 
  kiss, 
  help !, 
  i 've fallen through a wormhole into / r/netherlands and i ca n't get back !, 
  an economy based on saving will shrink . 
  that 's what banks do . 
  they have a reserve ratio that specifies how much they can loan out based on their deposits . 
  for example , they may need reserves of 10 % , meaning they can lend ten gold coins for each gold coin on deposit . 
   it 's idealistic of course as poverty existed back then and much in that video exists today , but was the crime rate and other social problems in suburbs as bad ? 
  the place where this happened was a [ shanty town ] ( http://www.tourisme93.com/document.php?pagendx=963 ) in the late 1960s . 
  the homicide rate in france has [ mostly trended downward ] ( https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_global_homicide_book_web.pdf ) since the 1950s . 
  it 's well under the us . 
  i thought about writing a list of the hundreds of events that are still on , but the / r/europe mob has decided that everything in france is cancelled until further notice . 
  :-) fuck 'em - cowards die many times before their death . 
   a man with a laptop conducted an intake interview . 
  `` he was asking normal questions like : ` what 's your name ? 
  what 's your second name ? 
  ... what 's your ambition ? 
  what do you want to become ? ''' mr. sarfo said . 
  `` what do you want to become ? '', 
  lol , he 's signing up for isis . 
  he wants to become nothing . 
  he wants to be killed or blown to smithereens .
