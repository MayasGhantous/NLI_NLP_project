  yep , one of my local towns cancelled fireworks last summer , citing expenses . 
  do you live in copenhagen ? 
  tie me kangaroo down / u/theworldcrimeleague - !, 
  are you suggesting they 've learned that one weird trick ? 
  no the guardian does n't need to make money , so its bias is consistently in one direction . 
  there are plenty of events maintained . 
  edit : lol . 
  this is controversial ? 
  wtf is wrong with the people on this sub ? 
  burning a bus is n't standard , but yeah it seems like fairly dumb vandalism . 
  they 're queuing because they 're only allowed in a few at a time . 
  they 're also limited in the number of goods they can buy . 
  it 's been like that for at least 15 years . 
  there 's the sncf , which runs services on some of the same train lines , so maybe that 's the distinction . 
  uncertain , but i 'm guessing that 's a ` no ' . 
  they are locals because i know the area where they live . 
   so much deterioration in the western europe in the last years . 
  there were cunts doing shit like this in dublin when i was growing up in the 1980s . 
  it 's not that new . 
  what 's religious about mindless vandalism ? 
  this is fucking retarded behaviour by dickheads with a fucking chip on their shoulder . 
  the result will be that buses will refuse to serve their neighbourhood , so the shitty place they live will get even shittier . 
  the people who will suffer are their neighbours and their own families . 
  probably petty crime , drug dealing , mugging . 
  ratp - it 's the paris area transport company ( r\u00e9gie autonome des transports parisiens ), 
  group of youths barricaded the road , got on the bus , told the driver and passengers to get off , then torched it . 
  do n't know what they were hoping to achieve . 
  that 's complete arse . 
  `` locals '' means `` people who live in the neighbourhood '' . 
  these fuckers live in the neighbourhood . 
  you can circle-jerk all you want over their background or their identity or their allegiance or their citizenship or whatever , but describing them as `` locals '' is a reference to their place of residence . 
  wtf is that supposed to mean ? 
  pretty sure it 's locals . 
  scumbags . 
  once my kids are educated , i 'm up there in oslo breaking windows . 
  i 'd love to be a carpenter . 
  hey , i do n't have a better suggestion . 
  it 's remarkable that there are two threads on my / r/europe front page , one extolling the virtues of norwegian prisons and the other reporting that these is-affiliated scum will get to spend 6 or 7 years therein . 
  does this mean they get to go to one of the nice prisons discussed in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vxmta/why_norways_prison_system_is_so_successful/ ) ? 
  ** 570xx ** , the index of 1337 $ ur0 c0mp4n13z, 
  `` kicked out '' sounds very active , like deutsche bank had done something wrong and was being punished . 
  `` sank out '' or `` fell out '' would be more appropriate . 
  that was cool and cheerful op . 
  never mind the begrudgers . 
  there 's a fundamental difference between saying that [ ** it is not correct to equate islam with violence ** ] ( http://christiannews.net/2016/08/02/pope-francis-defends-islam-its-not-fair-to-identify-islam-with-violence/ ) , which is what the pope has done , and refusing to condemn violence . 
  the pope has been consistent in his condemnation of isis and other violent islamic groups while refusing to condemn islam as a whole . 
  the obsessed-with-islam brigade are losing their shit over what the pope has said without acknowledging that it 's entirely consistent with what he 's said in the past . 
  [ e.g. 
  in 2014 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-turkey-mideast-iduskcn0je0ad20141130 ) :  pope francis said on sunday that equating islam with violence was wrong and called on muslim leaders to issue a global condemnation of terrorism to help dispel the stereotype . 
   the truth matters . 
  acknowledging reality matters . 
  moral clarity matters . 
  state your case clearly . 
  what truth is he missing ? 
  what reality does he fail to acknowldege ? 
  where is the moral ambiguity ? 
  is the problem with islam as a whole ? 
  is that the truth he 's missing ? 
   what they want is irrelevant . 
  agreed . 
    so that leave the other hundreds of millions of muslims that do n't support isis . 
  should the pope chastise them ? 
  balls . 
  either you want him to chastise all of islam , including the other billion or so who are n't in isis , or you do n't have a problem with what he 's said . 
  making allegations about argumentation does n't allow you to slip away from the issue . 
  should he chastise every muslim ? 
   actually , let 's criticise malaysian , singaporean , and indonesian muslims for the actions of malaysian , singaporean , and indonesian muslims . 
  i 've got zero problem with that . 
   all of islam deserves chastising . 
  maybe , but not for killing this priest in normandy . 
   so a little chastising of those doing the throwing rather than tut-tutting at the pebbles other have been throwing would be nice to what purpose ? 
  isis and its supporters do n't care what the pope says ; they probably want him to condemn them because he 's the head of the so-called armies of rome that they expect to defeat in the last battle before the eschaton or whatever the hell they believe . 
  so that leave the other hundreds of millions of muslims that do n't support isis . 
  should the pope chastise them ? 
  yeah , let 's criticise malaysian , singaporean , and indonesian muslims for the actions of a bunch of arabs and north africans and europeans . 
  anyone remember the [ hitler diaries ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hitler_diaries ) forgery ? 
  the russians could teach the norse a thing or two about trolling . 
  yes , as i mentioned elsewhere , the assumption is that force feeding is unnecessarily cruel . 
  let 's take a look at some research ? 
  [ force feeding : an examination of available scientific evidence ] ( http://www.artisanfarmers.org/images/foie_gras_study_by_dr._guemene.pdf ) i 'm just taking the conclusions :  although , it was not our initial experimental hypothesis , our research concluded that force-feeding is not perceived as a major source of acute or chronic stress by the waterfowls . 
   globally , in absence of wound or pathology , force-feeding does not appear to induce pain and is not a major source of nociceptive information integrated by the nervous system . 
   in conclusion , force-fed ducks or geese do not develop any avoidance behavior towards the force-feeder and the force-feeding context . 
  additionally , familiarization with the feeder appears to have beneficial smoothing effects , both on behavioral and physiological responses . 
  there 's an assumption by most commenters that ` gavage ' is painful to or * torturing * the goose or duck . 
  here 's [ an article that discusses the physiology ] ( http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/12/the-physiology-of-foie-why-foie-gras-is-not-u.html ) and suggests that it 's not quite so simple . 
  builders ? 
  i think people in the uk have had enough of builders . 
  er , `` primary concern '' ? 
  fair enough . 
  i presume that means there 's no need to raise them free range ? 
  i suppose so . 
  i do n't know enough about foie gras to make a comparison between free range and force fed . 
  nevertheless , from a purely consequentialist perspective , the goose is dead . 
  if someone 's primary concern is the welfare of an animal , they should be vegetarian , no ? 
  the goose 's liver still gets eaten . 
  from a quick web search , it does n't look like it 's available outside nz . 
  might try to persuade a kiwi friend to bring a bottle back for me the next time they travel . 
  well it is the curse of the irish to live beside the home of the currently most successful language . 
  speaking english makes a lot of economic sense . 
  nevertheless , i know many families who speak mostly irish among themselves .
