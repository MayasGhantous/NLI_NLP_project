  they do n't make a big fuss about it , they just get on with it . 
  in contrast the people who complain about the status of irish as an official language tend to complain loudly and in english , so perhaps your perception has been skewed by the noise they generate . 
  reality ? 
  the people of britain have had enough of * reality !, 
   mr valls , a socialist , warned that `` if islam does n't help the republic to fight those who challenge public freedoms , it will get harder for the republic to guarantee this freedom of worship '' . 
  this seems to me a very reasonable position . 
  young 's double chocolate stout . 
  tesco sometimes has it . 
   i consider telegraph to be very neutral in most aspects unless a major advertiser could be affected by a story . 
   i do wonder if the people who support independence in scotland care about scottish gaelic , if they intend to learn it at some point or if they think that the language should play any role in the future of scotland . 
  the difficulty in scotland is that gaelic is largely `` highland scots '' , whereas [ scots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_language ) ( e.g. 
  of robert burns ) is `` lowland scots '' . 
  it 's not really possible for a scottish independence movement to unite around one single language . 
   something similar in ireland . 
  the nationalist movement in ireland was very much involved in the language revival in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . 
  many of those involved in the 1916 rebellion were active in the language movement . 
  promotion of the irish language continues to be central to sinn fein 's policies in northern ireland . 
  during the ira campaigns , speaking irish came to be associated with violent republicanism , and this may have turned some people away from the language . 
  that association is gone now . 
  perhaps one difference with the basque country is that ireland 's nationalist movement has already been successful ( in a limited sense ) , so the identification between the language and the possibility of independence is less . 
  to the extent that small-scale farming has survived in the uk it 's thanks to eu subsidies . 
  once these are gone , i expect many farms will become nonviable , especially outside of southern england , where the consolidation has largely taken place already . 
  well perhaps in 5000 years time , it wo n't matter . 
  she has a more pronounced regional accent than the others , who are all speaking a bit flat . 
  it 's a bit strange because the young man who introduces himself as a gaeilgeoir ( irish speaker ) does n't have much of a ` blas ' when speaking irish , whereas this older woman does . 
  she relishes the language , from what i can see . 
  ( blas means both flavour and accent ), 
  there 's an online reference book here : [ gramadach na gaeilge ] ( http://www.nualeargais.ie/gnag/gram.htm ) this one is a bit bizarre : liam o'maonlai of the [ hothouse flowers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbiksolje7q ) has produced a free course described [ here ] ( http://www.independent.ie/life/family/learning/learn-irish-with-liam-o-maonlai-26460087.html ), 
   do n't they just loan those from english or scottish instead ? 
  there 's no need to borrow words . 
  most questions can be easily answered with a modification of the verb : * are you x ? 
  * - i am * is there y ? 
  * - there is yes and no are somewhat unnecessary except when used alone . 
  i was discussing this with my wife just last week !, 
  she speaks spanish but i do n't . 
  couple of questions spring to mind : 1 . 
  why was byron employing so many illegal immigrants ? 
  why did byron have to participate in such a dick move ? 
  could n't immigration have met people quietly as they arrived/left the workplace ? 
   1 , is just fhaca m\u00e8 . 
  uirth\u00ec is on her . 
   bit rough . 
  in fact 1 would be better as `` chonaic m\u00e9 \u00e9 '' your s\u00edne fada is pointing the wrong way . 
  traditionally the tories have favoured farm consolidation and larger scale farming . 
  i would guess that this will continue , so smaller famers will be forced to either expand or exit the market . 
  it will be a shame for the british countryside . 
  i love her accent !, 
  ten reasons why irish is an awesome language : \\* 1 . \\* irish has no words for * yes * and * no * . 
  when asked a question , you generally reuse the same verb to answer : an bhfaca tu an teilif\u00eds inne ? 
  ( did you see the television yesterday . 
  i did n't see it . ), 
  \\* 2 . \\* irish has inflected prepositions from ** le ** * with * : ** liom ** * with me * , ** leat ** * with you * , ** leis/le \u00ed / leis ** * with him/her/it * . 
  from ** ar ** * on * : ** orm ** * on me * , ** ort ** * on you * , ** air/uirth \u00ed / air ** on * he/she/it * . 
  \\* 3 . \\* irish words change their beginnings ( and not just their endings ) irish words have initial mutations that are usually caused by something that precedes the word , such as prepositions or determiners . 
  so from ** teach ** * house * : ** mo theach ** * my house * and ** i dteach ** * in a house * . 
  note that the initial mutations are not just orthographical , the pronunciation changes too : teach starts with a / t / sound , theach with / h / and dteach with / d / . 
  \\* 4 . \\* irish sentences start with the verb in most european languages the default sentence order is subject \u2192 verb \u2192 object , for example : the woman ( = subject ) kissed ( = verb ) the man ( = object ) . 
  in some languages it is subject \u2192 object \u2192 verb , like in latin . 
  in irish and the other celtic languages , the ordering is verb \u2192 subject \u2192 object : ph\u00f3g an bhean an fear , literally * kissed the woman the man * \\* 5 . \\* irish words inflect for contrast a noun can come in two forms , a default ` normal ' form and a derived ` contrasted ' or ` emphasized ' form created by adding a suffix , usually - sa or - se . 
  \\* 6 . \\* irish has several verbs * to be * \\* 7 . \\* irish numerals are complicated \\* 8 . \\* irish is strongly periphrastic \\* 9 . \\* irish explains much of hiberno-english \\* 10 . \\* irish explains irish place names and personal names rest at : https://multikulti.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/10-reasons-why-irish-is-an-absolutely-awesome-language/ edit : correction to the first because it was both wrong and a bad example . 
  i know you 're joking , but [ here ya go anyway ] ( http://www.dealz.ie/lucky-charm-cereal-pot-49g ) . 
  i did some consulting work at nokia in the late 90s and it was a great company to work with . 
  lots of really bright people who loved their jobs and were well treated by their employer . 
  well yes but ... the risk is they 'll go and get trained and then sneak back into europe . 
  i used to think we should send anyone who wants to go , but i 'm more concerned now that they 'll simply learn to be more efficient killers and then return . 
  even if we had perfect control of migration flows , there 's so much coastline to monitor that europe will always be open to infiltration afaics . 
  spread the fear , washington post , spread the fear . 
  even paramilitaries need a bit of fresh air sometimes . 
  though the balaclavas are n't going to help their tans . 
  a large number of widespread strikes in the run up to the championship . 
  a good question , and one that i ca n't answer . 
  but i think it makes sense to require every religion to become self-financing within the country . 
  if the catholic church is n't collecting enough money on a weekly basis , i 'm sure it has other assets that it could use . 
  you wo n't believe what happened next !, 
  i 'd support this prohibition . 
  i also think mosques should have their accounts audited by an independent office . 
   he said the suspect awaiting trial should have never been release . 
  that 's something that can be fixed immediately . 
  anyone who has tried to join isis since january 2015 should be incarcerated . 
  thus it was foretold by our prophets [ the prodigy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmin5wkoupw ) . 
  wow , you pretend to ask a question and when someone has the civility to answer you respond with this ? 
  i was wondering why your original question was downvoted ; now i know . 
  i love the tagline on the photo : nice bit of 340-year-old brie ( not the actual brie ) . 
  [ this states ] ( http://www.gov.scot/topics/statistics/browse/labour-market/trendpublicsectoremp ) that scots public sector was 20.9 % in q415 . 
  [ this pdf ] ( https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/economy/20161%20qes%20publication%20v2.pdf ) puts the number of public sector jobs in ni at 28.2 % in q116 , so the difference is about + 1/3 rather than + 1/2 as you suggest . 
  it also looks like public sector jobs are being lost ni - total number is down 7.2 % versus 10 years ago . 
  the jobs growth in ni has been in the private sector . 
   the suspect was accused of committing `` atrocities , human rights violations and war crimes '' , which `` pose a threat to switzerland '' . 
  these are quite specific charges for someone they lack information on and who may have been dead for 12 months . 
  how will they make a case without more information ? 
  scotland picks the thistle england picks the rose ireland picks the shamrock and ~ ~ redacted ~ ~ picks his nose . 
  both of them had tried to get to syria via turkey , afaik . 
   official statistics show that gun sales in some parts of switzerland soared nearly 50 % after last year 's attacks in paris and the march bombings in brussels . 
  and gun sales continue to grow since the killings in france and germany in the past two weeks . 
  without some baseline , `` soaring 50 % '' can mean increasing from 20 sales per week to 30 , or from 1000 sales per week to 1500 . 
   in wyss ' shop , `` the demand for pistols , revolvers and pump-action guns rose by 30 % to 50 % after this month 's attacks in nice and munich , '' he told usa today . 
  same issue . 
  we do n't know how many wyss normally sells per week , so it 's hard to understand the numbers involved . 
  switzerland has a high baseline number for gun ownership , but that 's because of the legal requirement to keep a gun at home . 
  an article in the local that i 'm not allowed to link to gives some more useful data : * the number of applications for gun licenses increased by 17 percent last year over the previous year .
