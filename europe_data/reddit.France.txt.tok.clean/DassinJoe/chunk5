  based on the experience in ireland , it wo n't be just tactics that come from the us . 
  there 's some very shady funding activity too . 
  the be-leavers have to use emotion because there are so many unknowns about the future in the event that they win . 
  it 's not possible to formulate a rational argument when basic things like the model for the new relationship ca n't be defined . 
  edit : do n't downvote just because you disagree . 
  downvote if you think i 'm not contributing to discussion . 
  good . 
  i hope he does a lot of time . 
  assuming that you lose a significant volume of exports to the eu , i do n't expect the commonwealth will be able to pick up much of the slack , given the disparity in gdp per capita . 
  a fair point and i can see that arabic is central to the religion , but latin was central to christianity for a long time and has successfully been replaced . 
  the goal is to establish an islam that is compatible with the host country : it 's bound to be difficult but to avoid excessive foreign influence it may be essential . 
  some of my favourites from france : [ dogue de bordeaux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogue_de_bordeaux ) or bordeaux mastiff . 
  [ beauceron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beauceron ) [ chartreux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chartreux ) and from ireland : [ glen of imaal terrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glen_of_imaal_terrier ) [ irish setter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_setter ), 
   we are forced into a protectionist market in things like agriculture to protect countries like france , italy and spain . 
  we can immediately replace these imports with cheaper ones . 
  how much will that save , from your analysis ? 
   the big deal for us in leaving is replacing exports . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  do you mean that you 'll replace exports to eu with exports to non-eu ? 
  how will that work ? 
  i agree 100 % on the foreign funding . 
  for the language , i 'd certainly encourage german as the primary language , up to and including an official german version of the religious texts . 
  this version becomes the reference version for german muslims . 
  15 to 8 suggests a 34.78 % chance of winning . 
  2 to 5 suggests a 71.43 % chance of winning . 
  the formula is : p = b / ( a + b ) , where odds are expressed a to b. 
  multiply by 100 to get percentage . 
  the outcome does n't sum to 100 % because the bookmaker keeps a cut of the market . 
  jaysus that was a great laugh . 
  it 's punchy , it 's friendly , and chess players will love it !, 
  this guy kamall has never managed to be elected to the uk parliament ? 
  oh i 'm sure there are talented people making those deals , but they 're not software engineers . 
  from what i can see spotify has n't developed much that 's game-changing on the technology front . 
  maybe some algorithms for playlists ? 
  they 've good marketing obviously . 
  yes , it 's been that way for a while now . 
   the share of exports with the non-eu is growing far more than share of exports with the eu . 
  that 's the key point . 
  in fairness that 's a different point . 
  saying that the uk `` is doing less and less trade with the rest of the eu '' suggests that the uk is reorienting towards other markets , swapping trade with the eu for trade with the non-eu . 
  in this case exiting the eu makes economic sense . 
  saying that `` exports with non eu are growing faster than exports with the eu '' suggests that trade with the non eu is growing but trade with eu is fairly static . 
  in this case exiting the eu may make less economic sense . 
  to my mind , looking at the [ volume of trade stats ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/chteufig2_tcm77-408364.png ) , the second statement is more correct . 
   `` our success is entirely dependent on being able to attract the best talent from around the world , '' daniel ek and martin lorentzon wrote in a blog post no lads . 
  your success is entirely dependent on your deals with rights holders . 
  no , fewer than 1000 in sweden i 'd guess . 
  it says [ here ] ( http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/interviews/a37865/interview-insider-spotify-career-jobs/ ) that they 've almost 1500 globally , with 400 in the us . 
  i 've seen the bookies get it wrong ( last uk election , for example ) , but i generally trust them more than i trust polls . 
   also , the uk is , with each year that passes , doing less and less trade with the rest of the eu . 
  no it 's a lot more complex than that . 
  it looks like the volume of imports has been steady or rising slightly since 2009 , whereas the volume of exports has declined somewhat ( with an upward blip in 2013-14 ) over the same period ( [ source ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/ots%20releases/ots_release_0216.pdf ) ) . 
  uk trade with the original eu-11 has declined since 2000 , but trade with the larger eu is about the same as in 2000 ( [ source ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2014/pb_britishtrade_16jan14-8285.pdf ) ) . 
  [ this chart ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/chteufig2_tcm77-408364.png ) summarizes the trade pattern of the uk with the eu and non-eu trading partners . 
  when we express growth in percentage terms , it 's important to know the basis from which we start .

  bye bye now , enjoy your personal echo chamber :-), 
  cheerio !, 
  i 'm not apologizing for anyone , and you do n't understand how guerilla campaigns work . 
  cheerio . 
  the betting markets have n't absorbed this apparently . 
  [ ladbrokes ] ( https://sports.ladbrokes.com/en-gb/betting/politics/british/eu-referendum/uk-european-referendum/220800266/ ) will give 15/8 on `` leave '' , versus 2/5 on `` remain '' . 
  [ paddy power ] ( http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/uk-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=704217 ) has the same . 
  they may be using the same oddsmaker though i have seen them diverge on political issues in the past . 
  interesting to compare the characters in the two paintings . 
  thanks , i was sure i 'd seen it before . 
  study how successful guerilla warfare works and get back to me . 
  the imf promotes the interests of international trade and economic stability . 
  it 's neither biased towards or against the british people , except insofar as it would seek to improve trade conditions and economic stability for the uk and its trading partners . 
   protecting their investors , the billionaires that they are funded by and work with . 
  what ? 
  the imf is funded by countries . 
  here 's the [ funding structure ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/finfac.htm ) . 
  did you think it was run by soros , buffet , and gates ? 
   most young arabs ... think ` caliphate ' will fail , poll finds most young arabs have realistic perspective on this . 
  good . 
   also i ca n't see what any of this has to do with ireland ask nigel lawson . 
  [ leaving eu ` will mean return of border posts ' in ireland , warns lawson ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/eu-referendum/leaving-eu-will-mean-return-of-border-posts-in-ireland-warns-lawson-34615093.html ) then consider that the dismantling of borders was a cornerstone of the good friday agreement , so many [ irish politicians will want to revisit that ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/brexit-irish-peace-process-british-eurosceptics-uk-borders ) . 
  plenty to do with ireland , imo . 
  simple solution : pick one kid , infect with actual ebola . 
  cool like vanilla isis ? 
  \u266a \u266b is-is , is-is baby \u266a \u266b . 
   someone from a school in molenbeek who said that the muslim students at his school were calling the brussels attackers ` heroes ' . 
  not in this article . 
  that was a different article last week i think . 
  brussels -- there are military trucks parked in molenbeek , and soldiers with submachine guns patrol the jittery streets of the brussels district that has been the epicenter of european terrorism in recent months . 
  on the place communale idle youths loiter , shooting glances at the police . 
  this is where the paris and brussels attacks , with their 162 dead , overlap . 
  salah abdeslam , the only surviving direct participant in the paris attacks , hid in molenbeek before his arrest on march 18 . 
  abdelhamid abaaoud , the suspected chief planner of the paris attacks , lived in molenbeek . 
  in all , at least 14 people tied to both attacks were either belgian or lived in brussels . 
  one of them is mohamed abrini , a belgian of moroccan origin who grew up in molenbeek and was arrested in brussels on friday . 
  he has told the police he is `` the man in the hat '' caught on surveillance cameras leaving brussels airport after two accomplices blew themselves up on march 22 . 
  cameras also placed him in paris last november with the paris attackers . 
  sleepy brussels : goodbye to that image . 
  yet even today there 's something soporific about this french-speaking city marooned within flemish-speaking flanders , beset by administrative and linguistic divisions and the lethargy that stems from them , home to a poorly integrated immigrant population of mainly moroccan and turkish descent ( 41 percent of the population of molenbeek is muslim ) , and housing the major institutions of a fraying european union . 
  it is hard to resist the symbolism of the islamic state establishing a base for its murderous designs in the so-called capital of europe at a time when the european idea is weaker than at any time since the 1950s . 
  a jihadi loves a vacuum , as syria demonstrates . 
  belgium as a state , and belgium as the heart of the european union are as close to a vacuum as europe offers these days . 
  belgium -- a hodgepodge of three regions ( flanders , french-speaking wallonia and brussels ) , three linguistic communities ( flemish , french and german ) and a weak federal government -- is dysfunctional .
