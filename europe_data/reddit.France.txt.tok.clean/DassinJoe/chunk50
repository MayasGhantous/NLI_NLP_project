  * there were 29,146 applications for gun ownership made in 2015 source is the local dot ch/20160725/terror-fears-trigger - swiss-run-on-guns so roughly 25k applications in 2014 for gun licenses , and a little over 29k applications in 2015 . 
  there are an estimated 3.4 million firearms in switzerland , so an increase of 29k per year is under 1 percent on the existing stock . 
  where did he say :  the french government has no interest ... of defending the french people . 
  where did he say :  the french government has no interest ... of defending the french people . 
  edit : here 's what he said following the truck attack : * `` nous voulons dire aux fran\u00e7ais que nous ne c\u00e9derons pas \u00e0 la menace terroriste . 
  '' * translation : we want to say to the french people that we will not cede to the terrorist menace . 
  times have changed and france will have to live with terrorism . 
  we must stand together , that 's the message of the president of the republic , show solidarity , remain calm collectively . 
  the goal of terrorists is to spread fear and panic . 
  but france is a big country and a big democracy which will not allow itself to be destablised . 
  there are some data from a few years ago in this article : [ northern irish workers : huge wage divide compared to uk peers doing same job ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/northern-irish-workers-huge-wage-divide-compared-to-uk-peers-doing-same-job-30356587.html ) . 
  discretionary income of 103gbp per week is not bad , imo , but i suppose the issue is that it 's half the uk average . 
   according to the quarterly income tracker report , the situation in northern ireland reflects lower rates of pay compared with other regions of the uk . 
  strange , given that the [ recent unemployment figure ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-36536332 ) was 5.8 % , whereas unemployment in scotland ( discretionary income 200gbp per week ) is [ at 6.2 % ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-36321056 ) . 
  down with the clown 'til we 're dead in the ground . 
  i 'm not that concerned about semantics , but when someone is untruthful they should be called on it . 
   i 'm not interested in digging up the exact quote . 
  lol . 
  you 're bullshitting so you accuse me of being petty . 
  valls promotes greater and greater powers for the security forces . 
  he 's never said  the french government has no interest ... of defending the french people . 
  because that 's not his agenda . 
  can you provide me with a source ? 
  dammit , have an upvote for `` departugal '' . 
   the french government has no interest ... of defending the french people . 
  i 'm not sure that 's what he said . 
   many asylum seekers in ireland ... have been refused refugee status in the uk already or their student visas in the uk have run out and they were refused permission to remain there . 
  all countries have to get a lot more clever in dealing with asylum applicants - the economic migrants are ruining it for people who have a real need . 
  yes , the [ paris museum pass ] ( http://en.parismuseumpass.com/rub-t-presentation-and-advantages-2.htm ) allows you to use the priority entrance . 
  you might queue for five minutes , but it 's much more bearable . 
  translation :  ** a note from the coordination of counter-terrorism unit had been circulated to all police last weekend . 
  **  `` the individual whose photograph features below is ready to participate in an attack on the country . 
  he is already present in france and could act alone or with others . 
  the date , the target and modus operandi are known at this time . 
  investigations are underway to identify and locate him . '', 
   a note from the coordination of counter-terrorism unit ( uclat ) entitled `` threats against the country '' and distributed to all police last weekend was correct . 
  the picture accompanying the text is that of abdel malik petitjean . 
  the latter was identified through dna samples as the terrorist accomplice of adel kermiche in the assassination of the church 's priest in saint-\u00c9tienne-du-rouvray , said the prosecutor of paris . 
  aged 19 , abdel malik petitjean was labeled `` s '' since june 29 for attempting to get to syria via turkey . 
  but he had not been convicted of anything and the justice system did not have his fingerprints nor his dna , which delayed his identification , finally made possible by dna samples taken from his mother . 
   it is therefore understandable why anti-terrorism agencies were unaware who was abdel malik petitjean . 
  the intelligence had made it a priority to identify and find the `` absolute urgency '' , as indicated a source in isb indicated to le point . 
   abdel malik petitjean , a native of aix-les-bains , regularly moved between montlucon , the town where his mother lives , and seine-maritime , where another part of his family resides . 
   in a video shot - probably - in the staircase of the house of adel kermiche , the two assassins pledge allegiance to the leader of daech , abu bakr al-baghdadi . 
  abdel malik petitjean appears to be the follower . 
  adel k. , who calls himself `` ibn omar '' ( omar 's son ) in arabic , swears to kill all infidels , taking the arm of his accomplice renamed `` abu jahid al-hanafi '' , which seems to indicate that abdel malik is a neophyte in the salafist engagement . 
  his cry `` allahu akbar '' is barely audible . 
   this delay in the identification of the second assailant at satin-\u00c9tienne-du-rouvray confirms the lack of human resources and sources available in salafist circles and the wider urban and suburban districts . 
  do we not pay today for the increasingly frequent sidelining of intelligence officers from these districts ? 
   tumblr that 's one i 'd believe . 
   using private server for government 's purpose does n't matter . 
  that 's a different case . 
  four hundred must make quite an impression . 
  here 's a bbc article : [ france church attack : second suspect in priest killing named ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36911766 ) he was on a watch list since june , when he tried to enter syria through turkey . 
  you know you 're getting old when the terrorists look younger and younger every year ... 
  how does this factor so-called blended cheeses ? 
  wensleydale with cranberry white stilton with apricots cheddar with caramelised onion double gloucester with chives and onion lancashire with garlic does wensleydale get counted once by itself , then a second time with cranberry ? 
  sure , let me explain . 
  someone said :  would n't want people to know its mohammed and osama doing these attacks rather than john and richard eh ? 
  i said :  you mean jihadi john and richard reid ? 
  he said :  jihadi johns name was mohammed emwazi without realizing that he 's describing an instance of the problem he thinks needs to be solved . 
  i did n't know what jihadi john 's real name was , mostly because this was the name used by the media . 
  if it 's so important to know that it 's mohamed and osama * , then nicknames like `` jihadi john '' should n't be used . 
  \\* though anyone with half a brain will figure out their religion without needing to know their name . 
  you had n't read the full article before you first posted . 
  and ? 
  okay , you read the original but you did n't understand it i guess . 
  i understand your opinion , i 'm just surprised you had n't read or had n't understood the original article before you launched into a long screed . 
  you missed the piece where the guy from state tv said they would n't follow this self-censorship . 
  and you do n't know enough about french newspapers to recognise that only one of the big names is involved . 
  you mean jihadi john and richard reid ? 
  isis claims every attack asap now - that will still get reported . 
  you had n't even read the article before you went off on your original rant ? 
  a couple of points that most people seem to have missed : it 's a voluntary move , not state censorship . 
  it 's a decision by a small number of organisations . 
  other media outlets disagree . 
  but it 's more fun to launch the hyperbole rather than reading the article . 
   the blackout is not total . 
  michel field , the executive director of news at the state-run france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions , issued a statement saying : `` our duty is to inform , it 's the right of citizens to be informed . 
  and we must resist this race towards self-censorship and grand declarations of intention . '', 
  did you read the article ? 
  it 's only a few media organisations concerned . 
  sweden and estonia are going to have to find something impressive to match that . 
  back in january , after their fingerprints were detected during a botched raid , the independent had an [ ` artist 's impression ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/baader-meinhof-returns-ageing-gang-sought-after-botched-armed-robbery-near-bremen-a6821966.html ) of what they might look like now . 
  [ corinthians 1 , 11:2 -16 on covering the head in worship ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+11:2-16 ) here 's a [ catholic discussion ] ( http://www.catholic.com/blog/matt-fradd/what-happened-to-head-coverings-at-mass ) about when if fell into disuse . 
  it was very common in ireland until the 1980s . 
  my mother would 've worn a scarf until the late 80s i think . 
  it was also expected for women to cover their heads in church ( catholic ) up to maybe 1982 . 
  there are reports that jihadi recruiters encourage new recruits to take drugs . 
  this makes them more suggestible and malleable . 
  it 's a bit like the old story of [ hassan al-sabah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hassan-i_sabbah ) and his assassins ( hashshashin ) . 
  the greek player was jumping when the time ran out ; she released the ball while the siren was sounding . 
  it 's normal enough for her to try to appeal this - the ref did the right thing in holding firm . 
    not doing enough  bah , this one gets said a lot and i 'll never get it . 
  it 's another way to excuse terrorists ' behaviour . 
  cross post to / r/itsallaboutme ? 
  was n't this drone delivery originally proposed by bezos as a joke and then became a thing because so many people were like `` wow cool '' ? 
  yeah , i thought that le monde series was exceptionally good . 
  okay , so when you say  doing jackshit to assimilate them you really mean `` allowing them freedom of religion '' , and your answer is to ban people from being muslim ? 
   doing jackshit to assimilate them i see this assumption all the time , but then i look at the profiles of most of the recent terrorists and plenty of efforts were made to assimilate them .
