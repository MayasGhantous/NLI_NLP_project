  four years `` is the uk now in a super awesome position that 's very jolly for uk and not at all jolly for the eu ? '', 
   yes . 
  i am a believer in free trade fair enough . 
  the last thing i 'd want is a return of the border , but i 'm not sure how it 's avoidable without a customs union . 
  this reminds me of the [ werner herzog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrnm9cmbdk ) interview in los angeles . 
  that would be great for ireland , but surely every eu member will then use ireland as a transit route to get its goods into the uk ? 
  or do you think that everything coming from the eu should be tariff free to import into the uk , even if the eu is using wto rates for uk exports ? 
  how would you assess tariffs and duties ? 
   no one really gives a shit about ni . 
  some irish people do ;-), 
   not on the uk side of the border there do n't have to be . 
  why not ? 
  you 'd just take trucks from roi without looking at their contents ? 
  brilliant !, 
  i might post a self.europe about this one . 
  thanks obama . 
  aside from all the hateful comments , i think there should be an independent autopsy ** any time someone dies in state custody ** . 
  this is part of denying the death penalty - simply put , we do not allow the collective to extinguish an individual life . 
  so yeah i support anyone 's demand for an independent autopsy . 
  i know right ? 
  boris and nigel the voices of the people ... 
  these guys are the most exuberant bunch of finnish men i 've ever witnessed . 
   they usually burn their own cars too useful for insurance claims sometimes . 
  very sad for munich , where i spent a happy summer many years ago . 
  this article prompted me to look up the phrase `` have your cake and eat it too '' . 
  this has equivalents in many languages , listed on [ wikipedia here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/you_can't_have_your_cake_and_eat_it ) , but my favourite has to be this : tamil : \u0bae\u0bc0\u0b9a\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b86\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b95\u0bc2\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b86\u0b9a\u0bc8 -- ** desire to have both the moustache and to drink the soup . 
  ** so there you have it folks , boris johnson wants to have the moustache but also to drink the soup . 
  honourable mention goes to italian : * avere la botte piena e la moglie ubriaca * -- to have the barrel full and the wife drunk . 
  the autopsy has been very clear that he was n't beaten in police custody , but that he was suffering from a severe infection affecting multiple organs . 
  i think the family is asking for another autopsy arranged by their own lawyer . 
  not sure if it 's being granted . 
  he was born into privilege and followed the necessary path ( eton , oxford ) to become a member of the british ruling class . 
  yes i think you 're spot on . 
  kids joyriding is unfortunately common , but killing two elderly women ... stupid idiots . 
  i think is did claim responsibility . 
  hey i very specifically did not twist your words . 
  of course terrorism affects economies , but so far the impact in continental europe is not significant , at least based on current figures . 
  the other thing to consider is the difference between a single decision point ( brexit ) and multiple decision points over decades ( immigration to europe , involvement in mena , etc ) . 
  while there 's a tendency among some to blame terrorism on simple factors , it tends to be a complex combination of factors . 
  i do hope you 're not responding to ** your perception ** of people saying `` ha , you screwed your economy '' with `` ha , you 're being attacked ! '', 
  exactly - they 're nihilists who seek only to destroy . 
   northern ireland was 100 % going to leave 100 % going to leave what ? 
  the uk ? 
  i 'd say irish re-unification is a possibility within my lifetime , probably more likely now than it was before the brexit poll , but i think you 're reading a lot of hyperbole if everyone was 100 % certain ni would leave the uk . 
  it 's worth noting that the data is from 2011 census . 
  [ here 's a more recent survey from 2014 ] ( http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2014/community_relations/ninatid.html ) , with just a single choice : which of these best describes the way you think of yourself ? 
  % british 37 irish 29 ulster 3 northern irish 24 other 7 do n't know 0, 
  his wife might be working up to the last month of her pregnancy . 
  remember there are separate companies . 
  eurostar which runs the trains . 
  british railways are so fragmented that there 's little interest in complementing the link to the continent , although i think intercity services to northern england , scotland and wales would make a lot of sense . 
  eurotunnel which owns the tunnel itself and runs the freight . 
  [ shareholder analysis ] ( http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/shareholders-and-investors/key-figures/shareholder-analysis/ ) . 
   but this really is kind of the opposite i dunno . 
  i 've been chatting with some of the brexit supporters and they certainly seem to think the uk is in a superposition . 
  sorry mate . 
  used to go up through ballyboden and rockbrook . 
  nearly thirty years ago though . 
  i used to cycle up to this ruin when i was a youngster . 
  never spent the night though . 
  the uncertainty really is not good for anyone , but it really sucks to be trying to make long term plans ( 3 years + ) in the uk right now . 
   it 's not really in in the eu anymore but it 's not out yet either schr\u00f6dinger economy . 
  triggering art . 
  50 will determine its eventual state . 
  honestly i expect it will depend on what deal the uk negotiates . 
  if a customs union is maintained , there probably wo n't be any changes . 
  if the uk goes for full-on separation ( e.g. 
  wto terms ) , there 'll be significant customs stops anyway so no real reason to facilitate passport control . 
  the volume of goods passing through the tunnel is far far more important than the number of people - the agreement was originally put in place to facilitate trade , not travel . 
  firefox tells me it 's up to date . 
   only one of those parties is currently threatening to bring the whole house down lolwut ? 
  the article we are supposedly commenting on has this title :  theresa may and francois hollande agree that border controls in calais will stay despite brexit, 
  [ here ya go ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72f7yl8y35v5gczo/giphy.gif ) . 
  there was french legislation at the time allowing airlines to be fined . 
  there was no legislation allowing trains to be fined , and in fact the sncf was not allowed to check documents . 
  the uk government discussed introducing fines for eurostar , but again there was no legal basis at the time . 
  the original agreement , which was to facilitate the tunnel ( not the train ) , was extended to cover the train . 
  this was in both the uk 's interest and france 's interest . 
   france would do well to show some gratitude lol, 
   french owned eurostar line the [ partly french-owned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurostar_international_limited ) eurostar line . 
   juppe seems the best choice overall for france , at least as an outsider looking in ? 
  well , he served his time in prison and emerged a more humble man who has learned from his past mistakes . 
  / joke - i do n't think he 's changed to be honest . 
  nevertheless , he is probably the least worst outcome . 
  sounds like a complete nutjob . 
  imagine what he 'd have done if the father of the victims had gone full joachim l\u00f6w . 
  off-topic but has the telegraph done a big redesign of their pages ? 
  the whole thing looks less celebrity and click-bait obsessed . 
   where does have bears ? 
  regional indicator symbol letter a ( u +1 f1e6 ) is not working in my firefox . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd only seen it in one article . 
  lol . 
  i explained why you were wrong and now i 've finished . 
  read back through my comments and you might understand . 
  if you need to discuss xenophobia in britain , i 'm sure you 'll find someone who will take your bait . 
  anyway , you 've already called me an imbecile so why should my opinion matter ? 
  edit : i 've just come across this gem from elsewhere in this thread :  let 's look at other nationalities in the uk using un 2015 estimations and the wanted list . 
   very few indian names on there despite 750,000 indian-born migrants living in the uk  very few jamaican names on there despite 170,000 jamaican-born migrants living in the uk lmao, 
  not that many `` pierced vaginas '' .
