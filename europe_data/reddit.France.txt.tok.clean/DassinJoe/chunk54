  it 's not hate or ill will , it 's just proper planning . 
  i think it 's more to stop them from seeking political asylum . 
  oh come on then you big teddy bear !, 
    here , let me repeat my first phrase for you , as you clearly have some sort of attention span problem :  i 'm not excusing the kid . 
    do you want that again ? 
   i 'm not excusing the kid . 
    once more with feeling :  i 'm not excusing the kid . 
  run along now . 
   what 's your next excuse ? 
  here , let me repeat my first phrase for you , as you clearly have some sort of attention span problem :  i 'm not excusing the kid . 
  do you want that again ? 
   i 'm not excusing the kid . 
  once more with feeling :  ** i 'm not excusing the kid . 
  ** now run along and play with someone who 's interested in your drama . 
   ( e.g. 
  during martial law in poland , during '70s / '80s economic crisis in romania , etc. ), 
  i 'm not excusing the kid , but afghanistan has been fucked for almost 40 years . 
  that 's two generations . 
  low to medium level warfare for most of that time . 
  it 's many levels of fucked-upedness higher than poland or romania . 
  [ french media ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/coup-de-folie-au-centre-de-vacances-20-07-2016-5980813.php ) has some updates : * the attack was carried out with a small knife , 8 to 10 cm blade . 
  * attacker 's wife says her husband was off his medication and had been in an agitated state since the previous night . 
  * attacker and his family ( wife and two kids ) were supposed to leave yesterday to go back to paris region . 
  * the guy did n't say anything during the attack about why he was attacking the kids and their mother . 
  french authorities are treating it as a psychotic episode rather than a terrorist act , at least for the moment . 
  that 's not `` freedom of movement '' in the way we normally understand it . 
  when we discuss fom in the context of the eu , we mean the ** legal ability ** to move from one place to another in search of work or to set up residence . 
  french media last night . 
  edit : that was the wrong link . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd understood he used to visit the club where he gunned down the people . 
  he 's given himself up . 
  yeah , i guess we 'll see what he 's charged with . 
  he was storing the dynamite at his parents ' house if i understand correctly . 
  you mean followed by an infinitive i think ( to prepare ) and yes the secondary interpretation would be more usual . 
  it still does n't make it a command though :-), 
  what qualifies as `` non leftist media '' ? 
  4 x 100gr sticks of dynamite sounds like safe-breaking equipment rather than a plan for a major attack . 
   they wo n't be able to buy their own house and live there on paper however since there is no border they will be able to move freely with nothing to stop them . 
  er yes there will . 
  someone trying to establish residence in ni will be asked for a social insurance number , or a passport , or some indicator that they 're allowed to do so . 
  just because there 's no physical border post brexit ( desirable outcome , but not guaranteed ) wo n't mean any eu resident can become a uk resident in ni . 
  anyway , we need a customs union before any of this becomes relevant , and i 'm not even sure we will get that . 
  wow , fuck wizzair . 
  that 's shitty . 
   mel gibson is an american , so it 's not . 
  he 's aussie originally . 
  they claimed that guy in florida too ; he was also a friend of dorothy . 
  are you seriously suggesting non-irish eu citizens will be allowed freedom of movement to work and live in northern ireland but not in mainland britain ? 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  some good news : the 8-year-old girl has had surgery and is no longer in danger . 
  yes . 
  yesterday there was a [ crazy guy on a beach wearing a djellaba ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/basse-normandie/manche/sud-manche/un-homme-en-garde-vue-apres-avoir-menace-de-mort-les-estivants-sur-la-plage-de-jullouville-1051041.html ) in jullouville shouting allahu ackbar and threatening to kill people . 
  today there was another guy wearing a djellaba who left a suitcase outside ecole militaire in paris and [ refused to open it when asked by the police ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/paris/1893719-20160719-paris-homme-djellaba-seme-panique-devant-ecole-militaire ) . 
  it 's very reminiscent of al qaeda 's modus operandi in the late 1990s , early 2000s . 
  any islamist terrorist action could be claimed by al qaeda and served to increase its `` profile '' . 
  because we 're in a new age of terrorism , where the terrorist organizations no longer have any standards ( e.g. 
  not killing women , or not killing children , or not killing coreligionists ) , it 's possible for isis to pin its name to no matter what atrocity you can imagine . 
  it 's like a local newspaper . 
  no reason for it to invent a story like this afaik . 
  the explosives were found in the guy 's home , not in his vehicle :  * des explosifs et des documents d\u2019identit\u00e9 vol\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9s \u00e0 son domicile * explosives and stolen identity papers were found at his home . 
  also he 's not a delivery man but a chauffeur for hire . 
  in his car , they police found papers , passports , and driving licenses stolen during a burglary committed at saint-maur-les-fosses, 
  he 's reported as moroccan [ here ] ( http://www.ledauphine.com/hautes-alpes/2016/07/19/il-poignarde-quatre-personnes-dans-un-village-de-vacances ) . 
  what a total fuckhead . 
   the headline uses the words `` tells '' which is a commanding verb the [ primary definition ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tell ) of `` tell '' is to communicate information . 
  the secondary definition is `` order or advise '' . 
   eu citizens can move accross all of ireland and even live in northern ireland even in the best possible scenario , i 'm not sure eu citizens ( non-irish ) will have the right to live/work in ni without some sort of visa . 
  the big problem is if the uk does n't manage to agree a customs union with the eu . 
  if there are tariffs between the former trading partners , there has to be some control between the republic and the six counties . 
   link me one poll that shows support for reunification no , i 'm not your monkey . 
   there is no threat to the good friday agreement . 
  the threat to the gfa is that the removal of borders was a basic condition . 
  this was voted on and overwhelmingly approved by people throughout ireland . 
  nobody in britain knows what 's going to happen with the border now - that numpty davis even referred to it as an `` internal border '' in an interview . 
  the threat to the gfa is real and it 's caused by an ill-thought-out referendum by the british people . 
  you pretend that you 're worried now about a threat to peace in northern ireland - but why were n't you concerned about it during the run up to the vote on brexit ? 
   that was n't my point though was it honestly i do n't know . 
  your point appears to be * `` people should n't encourage irish nationalists even though the threat to the good friday agreement is a result of british nationalism '' . 
  you 're failing to acknowledge that the threat to peace in ni is caused by brexit . 
   happy for the troubles to start again if it hurts the uk , disgusting . 
  wow . 
  that 's a leap . 
  people were warning for months before the brexit vote that it puts the good friday agreement in jeopardy . 
  now , post-brexit vote , you 're blaming the irish and the rest of the eu ? 
  take some responsibility for your own actions . 
   not sure if misleading title ... 
  the title is a fair reflection of the headline . 
  the headline says that the eu needs to be ready for the possibility of ni and roi reunifying . 
  might have been on her hols . 
  climate change ... so hot right now . 
  galway hit 30 degrees in july 2013 . 
  it made the news at the time . 
  * so we 're talking to large numbers of people who all want to help and we 'll get a very , very large trade area , much bigger than the european union , probably 10 times the size . 
  * [ - david davis ] ( https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/media-packs/2016/murnaghan-interview-with-david-davis,-mp,-secretary-of-state-for-brexit,-170716 ), 
   said he was peer-pressured into taking the pictures yes i saw that , but then they ended up on his mother 's phone ... 
   circlejerk about any negative brexit news there was a story a few days ago about how australia is eager to start trade agreement talks with the uk and it got posted here ** three times ** . 
  yes , it sounds like this is what he was charged with ( from / u/beckerbub ) . 
  two years seems very little . 
  sure just pop them on one of those unscheduled flights that stopover at shannon .
