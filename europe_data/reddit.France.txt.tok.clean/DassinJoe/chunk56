  no , that 's not alarmist . 
  free movement of labour has been there since the coal and steel community ( 1952 ) . 
  it 's a founding principle , and it 's simply not up for negotiation . 
  i really do n't get this `` the eu is threatening the uk with the rules '' attitude . 
  the rules are the rules - nothing has changed except the uk 's position . 
  sorry , here are the most relevant bits : ** can the uk just go ahead and trade under wto terms as soon as it leaves the eu ? 
  in practice , the uk would have to detach itself from the eu and regularise its position within the wto before it could sign its own trade agreements , including with the eu . 
  as roberto azev\u00eado , the wto 's director-general , said recently , there is no precedent for a wto member extricating itself from an economic union while inside the organisation . 
  the process would not be easy and would likely take years before the uk 's wto position was settled , not least because all other member states would have to agree . 
  ** how does the uk establish itself as an independent wto member ? 
  ** each wto member has a `` schedule '' of commitments for each of the agreements -- including agriculture , industrial goods and services -- setting out the terms on which it trades . 
  member states of the eu are bound by eu-wide schedules , negotiated by the bloc on their behalf . 
  the uk could simply copy the eu commitments and slide seamlessly into membership exclusively in its own right , as long as all no other wto member objects . 
  for industrial goods , this is a relatively straightforward process : the uk would simply adopt the import tariffs set by the eu , for say , clothes and shoes . 
  ** what about services , where the uk is the world 's third-largest exporter ? 
  ** the uk could extract its own existing promises from within the eu 's schedule and turn them into standalone commitments . 
  this would allow , say , foreign consultants or engineers to operate in the uk , though in fact the degree of liberalisation in the wto services agreement is low and the eu 's schedule is riddled with exceptions for individual member countries . 
  hosuk lee-makiyama , director of the european centre for international political economy and a former eu trade negotiator , says : `` in theory it 's not hard to create a services schedule for the uk out of the eu schedule . 
  but while it 's intellectually quite easy it 's an excruciating legal process . '' mr lee-makiyama notes that it took five years to integrate bulgaria and romania into the eu services schedule after they joined the bloc . 
  while some trade officials say it may be easier to create a schedule for a leaving member than one arriving , they seem to agree the process can be measured in years rather than months . 
   ca n't go higher than wto . 
  [ uk will have to reach agreement within the trade organisation before striking bilateral deals ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/5741129a-4510-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d ), 
   going to take us until early to mid next year to bolster our civil service enough to handle the workload . 
  bolster the civil service with , er , immigrants ? 
   ok , say goodbye to $ 420b worth of exports then eu alarmist . 
  even if the uk loses access to the single market , trade will continue between the uk and the eu . 
  maybe there 'll be some decrease as a result of tariffs , but trade will continue . 
  to think otherwise is childish . 
   this is why ultimatums and absolutism are ridiculous . 
  the eu 's position has n't changed since before the referendum . 
  it 's the uk 's position that has changed . 
   people may be drawn to the finding that more educated people like diversity , in order to status signal , what does `` status signal '' mean ? 
  here 's the [ detailed page ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-ireland.html ) for ireland . 
  the annual stats are coming from the uk and dutch governments , afaics . 
  i think may is a compromise candidate between the pro- and anti-eu camps within the tory party . 
  i do n't think the tories will split unless the deal negotiated with the eu is really one-sided . 
  rental market is nuts in cork too from what i 've heard . 
  [ he made those statements in 1981 ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1981/12/the-education-of-david-stockman/305760/ ) . 
  he remained director of the office of management and budget until 1985 . 
  again , the term originated from the reagan administration and was seized on by activists . 
  goes as far as orly aiport in the south and roissy cdg in the north . 
  your own link says it originated from david stockman , reagan 's budget director , and was seized on by critics . 
  looking at the [ lib dem implosion last year ] ( http://www.socialliberal.net/lib_dem_seats_in_2010_5_where_did_the_votes_go_part_1_of_2 ) , the risk to the tories of having another election is to give up the seats they gained . 
  ukip as a protest vote is likely a spent force having achieved its stated aim . 
  the risk for the tories is that people will drift back to the lib dems and cut into the tory majority . 
   most likely they 'll be a general election anyway do you think so ? 
  i 'd say most of the tories really do n't want an election anytime soon . 
  really ? 
  i 've seen it in chilled cabinets in italy . 
  how else could it be stored in high summer ? 
  i know you need to leave it at room temperature for some time before eating , but that 's the same with most cheeses . 
  it 'll be interesting to see what portfolio leadsom gets in the new cabinet . 
  whoever convinced her to pull out will also be in for a nice position . 
  could n't the uk simply fail to legislate for it for a couple of years ? 
  they seem a little old for cosplay , but whatever floats their boats i suppose . 
  not really . 
  he promised the referendum as a sop to euroskeptics in his own party . 
  ukip is simply not a threat in parliament . 
  everyone sees this . 
  refridgerated trucks . 
  no i do n't mean the stuff in the supermarkets . 
  mozzarella di bufala campana dop is available in several delis i know and a couple of cheese shops . 
  thinking of going to this towards the end if the week . 
  september is not a cut off point in any legal sense . 
  and what power does ukip have ? 
  one mp . 
  brexit may owe something to ukip , but functionally it 's david cameron 's fuck up . 
  most italian delicatessen sell buffalo mozzarella ; also some fromagerie . 
  good points . 
  this idea that the remain campaign has to give up is heavily pushed by the exit campaign ** because ** it is so insecure in its victory . 
  a shout-out to some irish cheeses because french cheeses are already famous : cashel blue cooleeney dubliner gubbeen, 
  italy : the landscapes , the beaches , the language , the people , the food . 
  yes especially the food . 
  and the dream that is rome . 
  really ? 
  lloris , giroud , griezmann , koscielny are n't . 
  i would n't call payet or rami `` black '' either . 
  edit : lol . 
  down voted for what exactly ? 
  make your point if you have one . 
  generations of inbreeding among the aristocracy of europe have not done von storch any favours . 
   a nation where about half still have n't come to terms with brexit . 
  absolutely nobody has come to terms with brexit , because nothing is known about how it will work . 
  well , i suppose cameron , johnson , and farage have accepted whatever is going to happen . 
   how about divine messengers of word of god ? 
  andrea leadsom would probably give them an audience . 
  heart-wrenching story . 
  exactly . 
  treated either as an eea member , with free movement etc , or as a ` rest of world ' member , without any special deal . 
   depends how they handle it , and there are still many unknowns . 
  yes . 
  it 's too early to predict . 
   what 's so bad about the eu that makes people want to punish those who wish to leave i wonder what 's so special about the uk that makes its people expect special treatment . 
  a majority of people in the eu want the uk to be ** treated the same ** as other countries ; that 's not punishment . 
  very happy for france . 
  good game germany . 
  thought the penalty was a bit harsh . 
  nice one mate !, 
  i was mobbed in zambia by kids who 'd only ever seen one other white male . 
  they all called me father mike because he was the other white guy they 'd met .
