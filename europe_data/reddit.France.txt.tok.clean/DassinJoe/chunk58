  yeah the snp and the lib dems are making hay . 
  whether it will translate into long terms gains for the lib dems is another matter . 
  me neither , but it 's still a surprise . 
  a good game - iceland kept playing to the end in spite of going behind in the first half . 
  the icelandic people should be proud of their team - a great tournament and a courageous performance . 
  what the fuck ? 
  ukip is fairly screwed without farage . 
  suzanne evans did a reasonable job getting a manifesto together for the last ge , but she 's been suspended for a second time . 
  on the one hand , i suppose it 's a one-issue party so there 's not much point in continuing . 
  on the other , i 'd have thought farage would stay on to make sure the tories do n't abandon the brexit dream . 
  i played it this afternoon !, 
  great for adults and kids . 
  this is good news . 
  i 've always liked scotland and the scots . 
  hopefully the irish govt can help . 
  gove and brexit will set the irish peace process back 20 years . 
  he 's a nasty piece of work . 
  glad to hear it !, 
  i 'd feel sorry for those 20 folk otherwise !, 
   negotiations with other countries in relation to free trade . 
  with all 20 of the experienced trade negotiators ? 
  or will some of them be dedicated to the brexit aftermath ? 
  the british people signed up to free movement of workers in 1975 . 
  it was in the treaties since coal and steel . 
  [ eu borrows to fund other countries . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/index_en.htm ), 
  [ eu can not borrow to fund its own budgetary expenses ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/index_en.htm ), 
  [ eu borrows to assist other countries ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/index_en.htm ) . 
   they are taking huge sums in loans lol . 
  no they 're not . 
  this is not a big deal . 
  there 's a lot of misunderstanding in this thread . 
  [ the eu as a borrower ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/index_en.htm )  the eu has some eur 53 billion in outstanding bonds . 
  it has a liquid yield curve consisting of 21 benchmark issues of over eur 1 billion maturing until 2042 . 
   the eu currently has three loan programmes to provide financial assistance to countries experiencing financial difficulties , all three of which are funded through bonds issued on the capital markets :  the european financial stabilisation mechanism ( efsm ) exists to provide support to any eu member state , up to a limit of eur 60 billion . 
   the balance-of-payments programme ( bop ) provides assistance to non-euro area member states up to eur 50 billion . 
   macro-financial assistance ( mfa ) is a form of financial aid extended by the eu to partner countries currently following an imf programme . 
  ...  eu borrowing is only permitted to finance loan disbursements to countries . 
  the eu is not permitted to borrow to finance its budgetary expenses ;, 
   why was this guy never on question time , etc ? 
  i saw a video he recorded before the vote . 
  it was low-key , analytical and sensible . 
  he 's received a ton of abuse as a result : http://www.legalcheek.com/2016/06/university-of-liverpool-eu-law-lecturers-incredible-out-of-office-email-response-to-bremain-haters/  since friday , the racist messages have starting coming in larger numbers too , along the lines of `` fuck off back to paddyland you fucking ira c *** '' . 
  charming . 
  new financial services centre in mullingar !, 
  people wo n't care tbh . 
   the pressure is on one side of the scale . 
  we will see . 
  i 'm already reading some scary estimates of increases in administration costs associated with exit , before a single tariff is applied . 
   also , two term mayor of london how long did london manage without a mayor ? 
  it 's simply not on a par with a cabinet position . 
  bojo has been left in the dust by gove , may , and hunt . 
  the word in the uk is that he 's washed up . 
  johnson shot his bolt and it misfired . 
  he 's hoping to wait out the inevitable disappointment on both sides ( neither exit nor remain will be happy with the eventual deal ) and bid again for the leadership , but he 's likely to be washed up . 
  nobody is taking him seriously any more . 
  the best he can hope for would be a michael howard style leadership in opposition while a younger more capable candidate prepares for government . 
  he 's still never had a full ministerial brief . 
   the longer they wait , the more damage the eu takes in terms of credibility and economic certainty no , the uk does not want to jeopardise the economies of some if its biggest trading partners . 
  a speedy trade agreement is in everyone 's interest . 
  we are seeing several high-profile political careers come to an early end ; there 's a political vacuum in the uk and no sign of a strategy being developed to deal with the outcome of the referendum . 
  obviously it 's early days , but the news keeps getting worse for both the exit and remain sides . 
  it 's a shitstorm . 
   what bit about gove 's education reforms do n't you like ? 
  i lolled at the requirement for every school to be above average in performance . 
   what the uk is doing is almost light speed . 
  light speed leadership crises in the main political parties ? 
  nothing else is happening afaics . 
  borders and customs points in northern ireland . 
  this will fuck up farmers especially , but also lots of trades . 
  i read his report earlier today . 
  he 's wistful for the days of maggie thatcher and attempts to stamp out nationalism in ni . 
   farage is going to be remembered as the churchill of his generation . 
  nope . 
  nowhere near . 
  churchill was a statesman ; farage is a sideshow . 
  if brexit goes really well for britain , it 'll be cameron and his successor who get remembered for it . 
  cameron for making it possible , and his successor for steering the ship of state . 
  jacques ~ ~ de ~ ~ ~ ~ molay ~ ~ delors , thou art avenged !, 
  the tory leadership is a poison chalice . 
  whoever takes the job will either : * be the pm who broke up the united kingdom , or * be the pm who reneged on the promise of brexit half the country will hate this person , and not just the regular hate that normal people feel for a tory leader , but a vitriolic unreasoning hatred that burns like a purifying fire . 
  the new pm go down in history as some sort of monster . 
  gove is perfectly well suited , imo . 
   compromises on immigration are out of the question , brexit campaigner nigel farage told le figaro . 
  well at least we 've stopped the pretense . 
  when they talk about `` autonomy '' , they mean `` right to refuse immigrants '' . 
  when they talk about `` independence '' , they mean `` right to refuse immigrants '' . 
  when they talk about `` free to pursue other trade agreements '' , they mean `` right to refuse immigrants '' . 
  when they talk about funding the nhs with 350 million extra quid a week , they mean `` right to refuse immigrants '' . 
  when they talk about `` right to refuse immigrants '' , they 're being completely honest . 
   maybe the welsh valleys ? 
  fill in the coal pits . 
  gwan the lads !, 
  positive vibes from irish fans at italia '90 was alleged to have caused a big uptick in tourism from italy because the locals were so impressed . 
   dig their heels in on a one of the key reasons free movement of workers has been there since the coal and steel treaty . 
  iceland : please take tariffs off fish . 
  china : please take tariffs off everything else . 
  both : it 's a deal !, 
  that only took six years of negotiations . 
  someone was warning about this before the referendum .
