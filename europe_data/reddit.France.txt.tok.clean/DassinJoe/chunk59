  and it 's one , two , three , what 're we fighting four ? 
   he wanted to take me to south germany . 
  clearly a euphemism . 
  but for what ? 
  damnit , you have an upvote too !, 
  yeah it looks cool , but bring garlic and wooden stakes just to be in the safe side . 
  omg !, 
  that would be so cool !, 
  do we need a new #bregret tag ? 
  maybe #wistfeul ? 
  depends on what country you live in i guess . 
  i mean , netflix 's offer varies a lot from one territory to another . 
  have an upvote . 
  somewhere on the mediterranean coast . 
  such quality entertainment does n't come cheap . 
  you said  i pointed out that the hospital the photo was taken in , is in an area where the vast majority of people are immigrants but in that area , the majority of people are british born . 
  again , the photo is a good illustration of why the nhs depends upon immigrants to function . 
  from [ this graph ] ( https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/where_doctors_in_the_uk_qualified.png ) it looks like over one third of doctors working in the uk trained abroad . 
  and [ this graph ] ( https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/where_nurses_in_england_trained.png ) suggests that about 12 % of nurses working in england trained abroad . 
  it is n't `` shitting on britain '' to point this out . 
  it 's acknowledging reality . 
   an area where the vast majority of people are immigrants no , you said a place * where 36 % of the population is white british * . 
  that does n't make 64 % of the population immigrants . 
  in fact , 61 % of hackney 's residents were born in the uk , according to the 2011 census . 
  in this area , the majority of people are british-born . 
  the uk is taking one for the eu team !, 
  what a noble sacrifice . 
  we have always been at war with eurasia . 
   obviously the only reason why it got so many upvotes was for people shit on britain once again . 
  maybe people thought it was a good illustration of britain 's dependence on immigrants for the health service ? 
  or does saying that mean ` shitting on britain ' ? 
  in which case the only thing you 're a victim of is modern life . 
   disgruntled worker fuck this person !, 
  what a crazy dangerous move . 
  how about give his/her details to the police ? 
  i guess you 'd need to analyse what bojo 's group said during the campaign in order to derive what `` promises '' were made . 
  the problem with having different groups campaigning on the same issue is that promises from group b are meaningless if it 's group a that does the negotiations with the eu . 
  if by `` you '' you mean the british , i agree they should tone down the anti immigrant stuff or risk losing their best immigrants . 
   english ~ ~ fans ~ ~ players googling ` what is iceland ? ', 
  ftfy, 
  a general election ? 
  not going to happen . 
  tory leadership election . 
  lol , it 's nevertheless the org that uk has to deal with . 
  no point in saying `` eu and uk will reach such and such deal '' while inhaling , then exhaling and saying `` eu ca n't reach agreements '' . 
  that 's taken 7 years to date and still has n't been ratified by eu afaik . 
  it 's the british ruling class . 
  i 've seen a few people mention the likelihood on facebook and on here . 
  some of it is heat of the moment stuff , of course , but there may be some long-term developments too . 
   piss off voters on both sites that horse has bolted :-) the tory party is leaderless ; the labour party is falling apart . 
  there 's nobody in charge , nor will there be until october . 
  it 's a clusterfuck already . 
   of course we 'd end up in a way worse position but i 'd guess a whole bunch of potential eu migrants will have been put off moving to the uk . 
  judging by the reactions of people already there , they feel unwelcome and basically shafted . 
  the medium term effect could be decreased immigration to britain from eu countries because britain gains a reputation as an intolerant place that does n't like foreigners . 
   eea means the single market , which means freedom of movement . 
  [ daniel hannan has already hinted it . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/tory-brexiter-daniel-hannan-leave-campaign-never-promised-radical-decline ) here 's the thing , the new relationship will be negotiated by boris johnson and other tories . 
  do n't be surprised if free movement ends up back on the table . 
  farage wo n't have anything to do with the negotiations . 
  he only has one seat in the uk parliament . 
  the eu wo n't budge on freedom of movement , imo . 
  it has been present since the coal and steel treaty . 
  i dunno , the stuff i 'm reading seems to suggest it is . 
  daniel hannan , tory brexiter : [ `` it means free movement of labour , '' the conservative mep said of the post-brexit model he envisaged . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/tory-brexiter-daniel-hannan-leave-campaign-never-promised-radical-decline ), 
  it dates back to their school days at eton apparently . 
  bojo was two years ahead of dave and has had a really hard time accepting that dave became pm instead of him . 
  yeah , i guess i 'm thinking more along the lines of [ this report ] ( http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8330 ) . 
  there 's no real ideological reason for these organisations ( national institute of economic and social research , institute for fiscal studies , and the centre for economic performance lse ) to make the claims that they did . 
  they 're basing it on their own modeling and insights . 
   i 'm not completely sure what his play was when he decided to back brexit his political career had effectively peaked as mayor of london and he did n't have options . 
  cameron was keeping him out of any important cabinet post to make sure he could n't build his profile . 
  osborne was the heir apparent , and failing him teresa may would have got it . 
  bojo was effectively at a standstill , so the leave campaign was a real opportunity for him to turn his career around . 
  now cameron has shafted him once again by refusing to do anything until october . 
  people think bojo is the clever one , but cameron has run rings around him politically several times now . 
  summary of options : * eea * swiss-like deal * another referendum i think the eea is most likely and the british public is being softened for that . 
  negotiating a swiss-like deal would take ages , and another referendum would cause the leave campaigners to take up their brollies and attack the houses of parliament . 
  there 's always wto rules , but bojo is effectively promising continued access to the single market and that most likely means eea . 
   political & economic experts , who are ruled by ideology well , yes and no ... 
  the political and economic experts are overwhelmingly well-versed/rooted in the status quo , but that does n't mean that they 're necessarily telling lies or making ideologically motivated statements when they say things like `` brexit will lead to an unsustainable trade deficit for the uk economy . '', 
  they 're basing the statement on their models of the economy and the likely effects of exiting the eu . 
  the models of the economy are somewhat self-fulfilling for various reasons , but they 're the best they have to go on . 
  they 're partly ideological but largely empirical . 
  it will be deemed brustifiable bromicide . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  what 's with the `` welcome to wales '' sign ? 
  i presume that bojo and gove have already privately discussed and agreed upon an acceptable future status , probably either norway or switzerland , maybe turkey . 
  farage probably wants wto relationship , simply because he can not deal with the eu in a sensible way . 
  the farage option would be economically disastrous for the uk , imo , and i ca n't see it happening . 
  in any case , a lot of leave voters will be disappointed with the eventual outcome . 
  either there 'll be a big economic unpheaval , or the stops on migration and payments to brussels wo n't materialize . 
   it falls within the royal prerogative powers and what does brenda think about brexit ? 
   cameron should 've activated article 50 . 
  yes , i agree with that . 
  waiting is only increasing uncertainty . 
   does not allow the winners of the popular vote to take office in fairness the vote was on a single issue ; it was n't a general election . 
  he 's not obliged to let anyone replace him until there 's a leadership election in the tory party ; indeed , it would be wrong for him to allow anyone take office before there 's a leadership election .
