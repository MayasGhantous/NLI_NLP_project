  that dysfunction finds its most powerful expression in the capital , where flemish geography and french culture do not align . 
  the administrative breakdown assumes critical proportions in molenbeek , the second-poorest commune in the country , with 36 percent of people younger than 25 unemployed . 
  as julia lynch noted recently in the washington post , molenbeek 's radicalism is not new . 
  it was `` home to one of the attackers in the 2004 commuter train bombings in madrid and to the frenchman who shot four people at the jewish museum in brussels in august 2014 . 
  the moroccan shooter on the brussels-paris thalys train in august 2015 stayed with his sister there . '' this is an outrage . 
  splintered belgium had lost control of molenbeek . 
  a heavily muslim district of brussels had in effect seceded . 
  if this were the extent of the problem , it would be grave . 
  but molenbeek is just the most acute manifestation of a european failure . 
  the large-scale immigration from turkey and north africa that began a half-century ago at a time of economic boom has -- at a time of economic stagnation -- led to near-ghettos in or around many european cities where the jobless descendants of those migrants are sometimes radicalized by wahhabi clerics . 
  as the french prime minister , manuel valls , warned recently , an extremist minority is `` winning the ideological and cultural battle '' within french islam . 
  the fact that the jihadis , often syrian-trained , are a minority , and that many muslims who immigrate to europe are leading successful and integrated lives , is little consolation . 
  after the carnage in paris and brussels , the laissez-faire approach that had allowed those clerics to proselytize , private muslim schools to multiply in france , prisons to serve as incubators of jihadism , youths to drift to isis land in syria and back , and districts like molenbeek or schaerbeek to drift into a void of negligence , has to cease . 
  improved intelligence is not enough . 
  there is an ideological battle going on ; it has to be waged on that level , where it has been lost up to now . 
  the moderate muslim communities of europe need to do much more . 
  europe , of which brussels is a symbol , presents an alarming picture today . 
  the dutch , susceptible to propaganda from russia , have just voted in a referendum against a trade agreement with ukraine for which more than 100 ukrainians died in an uprising in 2014 . 
  the british are set to vote in june on whether to leave the union . 
  the euro has sapped economies insufficiently integrated for a common currency . 
  a huge refugee flow has raised questions about a borderless europe . 
  president putin plots daily to do his worst for the european union . 
  there is a vacuum . 
  vacuums are dangerous . 
  the answer is a reformed , reinvigorated and stronger europe , not the kind of division that produced molenbeek -- a microcosm of what fragmentation can bring . 
  my two older children were born in schaerbeek . 
  my daughter , now a doctor in new mexico , took some of her first steps at brussels airport . 
  this is not the europe i imagined for them . 
  i love these paintings . 
  the shading and contour of some of the animals is amazing . 
   `` genetic study of population selected because they have n't moved much in several generations proves they have n't moved much in several generations '' . 
  yes , my grandparents are all irish , all from rural communities in a small country ; yet even among them nobody was born within 80km of another . 
  the study is basically looking at who has inherited the farm over three generations . 
  this story underlines the importance of the general public in defeating terrorism . 
  the reason certain revolutionary or resistance movements succeed is because they have support among the population . 
  others fail because they do n't have such support . 
  a ` blame all muslims for the actions of some ' approach plays into the hands of terrorist organizations . 
  they want to separate muslims from wider society ; they want to create a `` them and us '' mentality . 
  this will allow the terrorists to find greater support and facilitate more and deadlier attacks . 
  decent people are decent people , whatever their religious belief or non-belief . 
  because the full report was leaked recently . 
  yeah , i was thinking that might be a strategy . 
  or waiting until after , when everyone is trying to get to public transport at the same time , and there are hundreds of people packed together on the streets being corralled by mounted police officers . 
  it would be interesting to know if they had a plan to get past security . 
  one of them was caught in november and stopped from entering the stade de france . 
  he blew himself up outside , as did the other two .

  the article concerns lawson 's view that border controls will have to be introduced . 
  lawson is an english politician and head of one of the exit campaigns . 
  it 's nothing to do with the eu , petty and vindictive or otherwise . 
   a robot named genesis that looks like a cheap version of bb-8 to be honest it looks more like a [ dalek ] ( http://img15.deviantart.net/f857/i/2014/283/1/e/dalek__quot_exterminate_quot__campaign_by_degaspiv-d2vwx5r.png ) on stilts than bb-8 . 
   the one tangible is border controls ( for better or worse ) [ nigel lawson ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/brexit-could-lead-to-irish-border-controls-tories-warn-1.2605627 ) is saying there 'll be border controls in northern ireland . 
  this will be a huge issue in ireland , as the dismantling of the border was a keystone for the good friday agreement . 
   any such hardening of the border would be interpreted by irish nationalists and republicans as an abrogation of terms established in the 1998 agreement , endorsed through simultaneous referendums in the north and south , and made law in the british-irish agreement act ( 1999 ) . 
  that position would likely be supported by all of the main non-unionist political parties in ireland . 
   -- [ cathal mccall in the guardian last november ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/brexit-irish-peace-process-british-eurosceptics-uk-borders ) it 's going to be a huge issue . 
   as far as i know there is no limit on how many foreigners you can marry . 
  probably there is n't , but if you repeatedly marry and divorce foreigners with each of them gaining citizenship , you 'll probably be investigated for fake marriages . 
  the assumption with polygamy is that the marriages are genuine and durable . 
   what 's the difference between a kid and an unemployed adult ? 
  future income/revenue stream , societal replacement rate , blood kinship ( most of the time ) . 
  children under the age of 15 are n't allowed to work in many countries . 
  reports i 've read suggest only the bombers are dead , thankfully . 
   after i volunteered to resign as director general of the british chambers of commerce so that i could speak freely about brexit , in fact he first started speaking freely about brexit ( march 3rd ) , in contravention of his organization 's policy , then he was suspended ( march 5th ) , then he volunteered to resign ( march 6th ) . 
   what about these mormons that you have in america ? 
  most of them do n't practice polygamy , it 's only the breakaway minority sects that do . 
  well , as a citizen of your country , you normally have the right to marry a foreigner and have them become a citizen . 
  should you have the right to marry two foreigners ? 
  what about ten ? 
  for taxation , it 's fairly standard that a ` household ' can be formed by two adults , with perhaps one of them not working but allocating their tax credits to the other person . 
  is it fair to allow a third adult in this household formation ? 
  how easy should it be to add more adults ? 
  i 'm not saying it stops working , just that there are important issues to consider . 
  thanks - i thought i 'd done that but it did n't work . 
  tried again and it 's sorted . 
  i 'm discussing what happened at the end of the bosnian war : germany obliged asylum seekers to go home . 
  you 're insisting that this is about something else - the current refugee crisis - but not everything is about that . 
  there have been other refugee crises . 
  what ? 
  obliging bosnian refugees to go home once the situation in bosnia had calmed down is `` incredibly naive and short sighted '' ? 
  yes , germany is admirably serious about this sort of thing . 
  ** `` i 'll arrive at 10:00 '' younes abaaoud has left syria to avenge his brother ** the little brother of the french jihadist , who died november 18 , 2015 during the assault in saint-denis , is worrying interpol . 
  closely monitored by the belgian anti-terrorist services , younes abaaoud , the little brother of abdelhamid shot during the assault in saint-denis last november , worries interpol . 
  according to a note from the international police organization consulted by paris match , the youngest of the family has left syria and is on his way to europe where he hopes to avenge the death of his brother . 
  `` i 'll be there at 10 am '' : these are the words that put a flea in the ear to interpol . 
  on february 18 , the organization cut the telephone exchange between the teen and his sister yasmina , who lives in belgium . 
  ** a `` disappeared minor to be arrested immediately '' ** in the aftermath of the attacks of paris , 3 december 2015 , the return of younes abaaoud was announced from syria . 
  he said he wanted to `` avenge the death of his elder brother . '', 
  but in the aftermath , younes is given up for dead . 
  dead , really ? 
  before the terrorist attacks in paris , abdelhamid abaaoud had also been given up for dead . 
  a lure , designed to mislead investigators because he 'd quietly returned to europe to prepare the attacks of november 13 , 2015 . 
  belgian investigators did not let themselves be fooled and ended up locating younes abaaoud in saudi arabia ( jeddah precisely ) `` probably in the company of other unidentified people , '' says the note obtained by paris match . 
  the 15 year old is also described as a `` terrorist '' , `` killer '' , `` warrior-jihadist '' and reported as a `` missing minor '' , `` dangerous '' , `` stop and detain immediately . '', 
  ** the french ministry of interior prudent ** in this note , interpol says that the young abaaoud could take a plane `` to any destination in turkey , morocco or europe '' and calls for vigilance : `` he may have changed his appearance and travels with false identity papers . '', 
  but the french ministry of the interior denies any knowledge of the note and does not believe that the youngest of the family abaaoud has come back to france . 
  i think because of [ la\u00efcit\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la%c3%afcit%c3%a9 ) .
