   this is not about old fashioned conceptions of racism no , you mutter darkly about `` supranationalism '' and `` powerful societal forces '' without making any sort of explicit case . 
  but probably it 's not much more evolved than the `` old-fashioned '' anti-immigrant stuff . 
  let 's look at the scant information you offered : `` threat to culture '' - check , `` religious tension '' - check , `` class solidarity '' - check , `` ethnic identity '' - check . 
  they went through all this in britain in the late 70s ; what 's so special about now that makes tommy robinson the hero of the hour ? 
  if genuinely you ca n't see the direct line of descent from the bnp in the late 70s/early 80s to tommy robinson , then there 's no point in discussing this further . 
  edit : just out of interest , did you see the footage of billy bragg telling some guy from britain first about where st george was born ? 
  okay , if you 're sure then fair enough . 
  there was never much worry about getting leave voters to show up ; it was the remain voters who 'd become complacent up until quite recently . 
   it is not about me as an individual migrant in germany or about an individual migrant in london but you 've already individualized it by saying that :  if billy bragg were 30 years younger ... he 'd be in tommy robinson 's shoes . 
  you 've taken the specific case of a singer and activist , and you 've said that he would follow a different path if he were younger today . 
  but it is an undeniable fact that he had the chance to sign up to the bnp , yet instead he signed up to [ rock against racism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race ) , which was a direct reaction against the bnp . 
  you 're engaging in mental gymnastics to justify your original statement , but that does n't make it any more defensible . 
  clearly you like billy bragg , and you want to reconcile that with a political philosophy that considers tommy robinson his contemporary equivalent , but this is simply not sustainable . 
  his views on britain first and its predecessor organisations . 
  blaming immigrants for the ills of the british working class is n't a new thing , but given that billy bragg did n't sign up with the national front in the 1980s , why on earth do you think he 'd be tommy robinson now ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bdov6hbnmy van the man and them . 
   he 'd be in tommy robinson 's shoes you really have n't paid much attention to billy bragg if you believe that . 
   free trade area agreement nope , the previous trade agreements between ireland and the uk were superseded when both joined the eec . 
  if the uk leaves , the new trade agreement between the uk and the eu will be implemented for ireland . 
  the common travel area will have to be reconsidered in light of ireland becoming an eu border with the uk . 
   whilst ireland is distinct , it 's ** still effectively part of the uk ** like scotland and wales . 
  lmao . 
  can you please post that on / r/ireland just for fun ? 
  but do you reckon they 've seen the movie independence day ? 
  millions upon millions dead . 
  i personally favour the celtic archipelago , but maybe a combination of letters from the constituent names would work . 
  ** i ** reland , co ** r ** nwall , ** e ** ngland , wa ** l ** es , m ** a ** n , ** n ** orthumbria , scotlan ** d ** there ya go !, 
  we 'll call the whole place i-r-e-l-a-n-d !, 
  oh wow , look at that ... 
  yeah , but the demographic skew is such that more older people want to leave and more younger people want to stay . 
  so it 'll sort itself out over time . 
  the articles misses the bigger picture , which is that british politics has scleroticized to the extent that there are very few working class politicians to represent working class interests . 
  the labour party features bon vivant metropolitan progressives , intellectual social democrats , and the occasional throwback to the socialist past , but john prescott is the only major figure of recent years whom i 'd consider working class . 
  labour and the lib dems are resolutely middle class in their leadership , while the tories are middle to upper . 
  it 's difficult to find any working class leadership in the exit campaigns . 
  the writer of this piece is a former city banker and a financial journalist . 
  farage worked in the city before becoming a member of the european parliament . 
  johnson is a toff , pure and simple . 
  gisela stuart might be the only prominent [ leave campaign ] ( http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/campaign ) member with something resembling a working class background , but even she has an llb from the university of london . 
  london is great but too far east i 'm afraid . 
  we need somewhere close to the epicentre like - * makes imaginary measurements on an imaginary map and places an imaginary pin * - dublin !!, 
  i 'll call it : remain . 
  main factor remain voters have been scared by how high leave was polling . 
  people who want to stay but might not have shown up will now show up and vote . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ trying ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ welsh ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ scots ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ board . 
  four teams progress from the celtic archipelago !, 
   edit : it is happening yes , because you 're doing exactly what you were asked not to do in the comment you replied to . 
  you 'll explain to me the hidden agenda , will you ? 
  no , i 'm sure they put some effort into it , but i doubt they overthought it the way most of the obsessives on here have . 
  amazing how a series of light-hearted photos to get across an important message about safe sex get analyzed beyond all reason by people obsessed with ethnicity and appearance . 
  it 's a bunch of people wearing body paint , ffs !, 
  they have n't met many black people . 
  maybe she is , and her niqab is lying in an untidy heap on the floor just off camera . 
   yellow and purple ecclesiastical , spring colors , associated with the christian resurrection . 
  but yes , they contrast well when together . 
  i 've seen some really good work done in paint . 
  the ukip logo looks like it was done using ms wordart . 
  it 's nice that they 're employing a 14-year-old on work experience to handle their desktop publishing . 
  love the borderline insane randomness of the capitalization too . 
  freedom !, 
  the commission is as undemocratic as the second chambers of several european countries . 
  commissioners are appointed based on political patronage by the ruling party of a given country . 
  rather than `` unelected bureaucrats '' it seems to me the commission is normally made up of `` previously elected politicians '' . 
  it 's often a sinecure granted to a loyal party member or former leader . 
  lol , where did you acquire so much butt hurt ? 
  i 'd have thought stopping brexit would be in the remit of mi6 ( now sis ) ? 
  some legendary names there . 
  johnny giles !, 
  nah , i think they started singing and then people switched on their cameras . 
   not exactly any different from the polls . 
  er , suggesting a much higher likelihood of remain than the polls . 
  ( per the article , opinium had 44:44 , yougov had 44:43 favouring remain , survation gave a 3 point lead to remain ), 
  we 're still well within the margin of error for these polls , and it was to be expected that `` in '' would regain some lost ground . 
  i 'm paying more attention to the betting markets than to opinion polls at this stage . 
   pushing it above france . 
  from that page you linked to : france 's total contribution including tor minus eu expenditure in france : 20,967.7 minus 13,479.1 = 7488.6 uk 's total contribution including tor minus eu expenditure in uk : 14,072.3 minus 6,984.7 = 7087.6, 
   are you aware that it 's criminal to be homeless in the uk : today ? 
  no it 's not . 
  some councils have introduced public space protection orders that target homeless people , but it 's not a criminal offense to be homeless in the uk . 
  there are [ vagrancy laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vagrancy_%28people%29#united_kingdom ) that prohibit sleeping on the streets and begging . 
  these laws are still in place in england and wales ( since 1824 ) though they were repealed in scotland . 
   because the public would rather house the homeless in warm jail cells and prisons where they can be fed than have them abused on the streets . 
  the criminalization of vagrancy and the targeting of homeless people by pspos is nothing to go with housing the homeless in warm jail cells . 
  the odds on leave [ drifted a lot ] ( http://predictwise.com/politics/uk-politics ) on saturday and sunday , presumably based on new opinion polls . 
  the disunity in the leave campaign ca n't be helping either . 
   fire ballistic missile with nuclear warhead at brussels fire a missile at the town that hosts nato headquarters ? 
  you 've thought this one through carefully . 
   the uk provides more than 10 % of the total eu budget and is the second highest net contributor after germany . 
  source for that ? 
  [ these figures ] ( http://english.eu.dk/en/faq/faq/net_contribution ) for 2014 suggest that top net contributors are germany then france then uk . 
  home made gun that shoots more than once ? 
  would surprise me . 
  looks like leave drifted yesterday morning from 40 to 37, 
  the economist is always ready to criticize the eu and brussels policy making . 
  for that magazine to take such a strong pro-remain stance is a good indication of how seriously they take the threat to britain 's economy . 
  yeah i saw . 
  her poor family . 
  do you remember who you gave it to last ? 
  your compulsory irish lessons will begin shortly . 
  nice one !,
