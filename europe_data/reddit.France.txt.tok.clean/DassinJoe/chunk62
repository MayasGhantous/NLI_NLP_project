  may she rest in peace . 
  my thoughts are with her family and loved ones . 
   a man from the dry cleaners had tried to stop the attack . 
  fair play to him . 
  yes , people have given up their basic human empathy for political posturing . 
   seems a bit too convenient , ah for fuck 's sake she 's in a critical condition . 
  * passes you the popcorn *, 
  that 's unlikely to happen . 
   we want to get rid of it . 
  who is `` we '' in this scenario ? 
  i 'd assume scotland will vote again asking to leave the union to rejoin the eu . 
  that leaves england and wales . 
  the northern irish unionists command about 46 % of the vote in elections , so it 's touch-and-go whether a vote to reunify would be carried . 
  sinn fein want such a vote , and to be honest they 're entitled to it in the even of the uk leaving the eu . 
  to facilitate a transition . 
  especially if it 's a choice of x billion for 10 years , versus 2x billion for eternity . 
  assuming everyone agrees on unification , england might pay to facilitate a transition . 
  as mentioned , ni is a financial drain currently . 
  a united ireland would need eu ( remaining uk ? ), 
  financial support to begin with , but it would hopefully become autonomous after 10 years or so . 
   not applying the same boot-to-neck strategy to others is a bit crappy . 
  they 've been harsher on the russians than on the english afaics . 
  i think the uk would be absolutely crazy to vote leave , but i 'm getting excited nonetheless . 
  more detail in the guardian : https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/15/england-and-russia-fans-brawl-in-lille-at-euro-2016  trouble flared again at euro 2016 on wednesday when england and russia fans brawled and chased one another through lille city centre , in echoes of the violence that marred their opening weekend match in marseille . 
  not clear who is at fault at this point . 
  got to laugh at the mod decision - it 's an article in german , about english fans , in a french town ( on the border with belgium ) , throwing money at roma ( ? ), 
  children . 
  and so it 's local news . 
  no worries . 
  english fans are generally great , but some of the lads in marseilles were acting like dickheads . 
  that plus the whole brexit thing has people feeling a bit negative towards the english i think . 
  good explanation , thanks . 
  it 's banter man . 
  some of my best friends etc. 
  nah , the welsh and scots are lovely , as are the norn irish . 
  here 's a very very funny clip of irish fans with a hungarian reporter : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzlitt1gsko hungarian guy is a complete professional and a real sport . 
   people who will lose their jobs farage will lose his job , that 's for certain . 
  [ flexcit plan to quit eu ` would mean still pay , no say ' ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/14193087.flexcit_plan_to_quit_eu__would_mean_still_pay__no_say_/ ) that one ? 
  i do n't think farage can go for it . 
  i do n't think the french want an exit . 
  macron is talking about what was a hot topic at the time because there 'd been riots at calais and migrants storming onto a ferry ( led by some british anarchists , btw ) . 
   it 's a shame they 're using that as threat then . 
  it 's both a threat and a factual statement . 
  he 's stating , correctly , that the touquet accord will have to be revised in the result of brexit . 
  given that there 'll be more customs/excise checks if britain leaves , this is unavoidable . 
  what 's he supposed to say ? 
  `` everything will just continue as before if britain leaves '' ? 
  it wo n't though , it 'll be very different . 
   i do n't believe it 's anything to do with the eu . 
  you 're partly correct on that point . 
  afaik it 's a bilateral accord concluded by the two countries and not directly related to the eu . 
  however , because it covers questions around customs and transport of goods across borders , it will have to be revisited if britain withdraws . 
   what a sensationalistic piece !, 
  part of politico 's shtick is to make politics more interesting by sensationalizing it . 
  they promised to `` revolutionize '' political reporting in europe and this is how they 're planning to do it . 
  here 's the full transcript : https://next.ft.com/content/b6d2b1ce-e12d-11e5-8d9b-e88a2a889797 with the relevant part :  if british voters chose to exit the eu , collective energy would be spent unwinding existing links , not creating new ones . 
  it 's not scaremongering . 
  we have to explain how those ties would be unpicked . 
   the day this relationship unravels , migrants will no longer be in calais and the financial passport will work less well . 
  our will is not to revise the touquet accord [ allowing uk border checks in france ] but it would be threatened by such a context . 
  he is not `` saying they 'll send all the migrants in calais to the uk '' , he 's saying the touquet accord will be threatened . 
  in this case , border controls happen on the british mainland , not in calais . 
  this is not the same thing as `` we will send all the migrants to calais '' and it 's disingenuous to pretend that it is . 
  no they did n't say that . 
  it was an ft interview with macron and he said that `` the border at calais ( where passports are checked before entering eurotunnel ) wo n't be there anymore '' . 
  the uk press spun this as `` france threatens to bring all migrants to dover '' . 
  edit : downvotes !?!, 
  it 's voltaire you bloody heathens !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  france 's strong stance on secularism has attracted extra hatred from the islamists . 
   eu taxation of our financial services sector you mean the eu [ ftt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_financial_transaction_tax ) ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  the story says :  russia out of euro 2016 if more stadium trouble , says uefa i ca n't find any mention of russian fans being thrown out . 
   i think a large part of this is 2 of his major moves in the last month have coincided with an islamic agenda . 
  it 'd be one thing if he just plucked the idea out of his ~ ~ arse ~ ~ koran , but it was a pledge in his manifesto so he effectively has a mandate from the people of london on this issue . 
  the time to challenge this was during the election , was n't it ? 
  london mayor does something that was in his manifesto when people voted for him . 
  jaysus , we complain enough about politicians reneging on their policy promises , now we have to complain when they keep them too ? 
  where will i find the time ? 
  have they entered europe illegally ? 
  or on tourist visas and overstayed ? 
  or they said they were on their way to germany to claim asylum but came to france to try to sneak into the uk ? 
  it 's very tough to prove someone has illegally entered europe , especially if they destroy their papers . 
  the `` crime '' they could be charged with is being on french territory without a permit or without identity papers . 
  as soon as they 're charged they 'll probably claim asylum , then they 'll disappear while their case is being evaluated , ending up in belgium or perhaps the netherlands to try to sneak into britain from there . 
  `` round them up and put them in jail or deport them '' sounds enticingly simple , but they wo n't stay in jail for long and it 's not clear for a lot of them where they can be deported to . 
  lol . 
  your username says you 're a troll , your first comment is trolling sarcasm with no elaboration , and i 'm a child ? 
  but yeah , the kids that are the subject of the op . 
  you remember , the article we 're discussing . 
   weak cop out : ^ ) sarcasm obviously . 
  you chose the username mate . 
  did you get it cheap ? 
  so you round up these kids , imprison them and send them back . 
   i say we totally give up , user name checks out :-), 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  lock these young people up ? 
  they 've committed no serious crime . 
  they 'll often simply come back to northern france . 
  the french government does try to get people to claim asylum in france and does try to house them away from calais while their application is being processed .
