  it 's an aggregator of prediction markets , bookmakers , and polling : http://predictwise.com/politics/uk-politics, 
   the 15th century . 
  not sure if that counts as ` hundreds and hundreds of years . 
  minimum 400 , so by definition it does . 
  just this week in conversation with two english people they started taking off my accent ( very poorly , i might add ) . 
  typeface for `` m '' is very close to the one used for `` m&m '' . 
  this case has been going since 2009 - two sweet giants facing off . 
   in the recordings , he estimates he has smuggled 7,000 or 8,000 people . 
  in one , he is reportedly heard laughing at the overloading of migrant boats . 
  lowballing , 7000 people x 2000 euro -  yes , he 's pulling in millions . 
  what a terrible disregard for human life though . 
   there are more poles than there are welsh iirc in the uk ? 
  no , there are 3 million welsh and less than 1 million poles . 
  you really ** want ** to work ? 
  i find it 's overrated . 
  try twitter with #seine or #pariscrue, 
  sorry cobber , but i 'm going to have to ask you to make up your mind . 
  is it tariffs or subsidies ? 
   that level of flooding is far beyond what we see now moret sur loing peaked yesterday below the 1910 level . 
  the loing has been subsiding . 
  the bbc had [ a piece about 1910 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36443329 ) with some more photos . 
   we have a 1.2 % tarrif for agricultural imports as opposed 118 % for agriculture in the eu lol . 
  you 're just making shit up . 
  amazing palette . 
  i read something maybe a month ago suggesting we might expect some flooding . 
  wow . 
  i went to look at the seine near my house last night . 
  it 's really swollen and appears to be flowing at two or three times the normal speed . 
  some of our local roads are closed off , and a few friends ' houses have flooded . 
  one family with a new floor installed two weeks ago . 
  if you 're visiting the paris region , i highly recommend [ le mus\u00e9e de la grande guerre ] ( http://www.museedelagrandeguerre.eu/ ) in meaux . 
  i went recently and it is exceptional . 
   i misread that as subsidising lol, 
  really ? 
  it 's in the introduction to the chapter . 
  he does n't show it by the end either . 
  it would be more popular if there were more teachers available . 
  okay . 
  i 'm not sure there 's much that is new here . 
  how do you understand this sentence ? 
   the minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game , in the form of courage , for society to function properly . 
  why / r/europe ? 
  he 's very very very good at visits . 
  he 's heard from hundreds of people that he 's the best at visits . 
  he does n't know , but that 's what people - including really really really famous people - are telling him , that he 's the best at visits . 
  several towns south of me are flooded but it 's subsiding now . 
  most demand will be for english . 
  after that german , arabic , portuguese , spanish , russian . 
   is n't that an issue for individual members , not the eu ? 
  i 'm pretty sure immigration policy is a national competency well , the eu members individually in that case . 
  one assumes if the uk introduces a points system for a bloc , the members of that blic will reciprocate in kind . 
  i would n't worry too much about short stay business visas , but my colleagues are seconded for months or years at a time . 
   it looks like bookmakers are indeed shortening their odds on leave , and rapidly so odds have been moving up and down for months . 
  here 's a tracker : http://predictwise.com/politics/uk-politics you 're correct that there 's some recent shortening on leave , but this looks like a return to trend after a big drift last week rather than anything else . 
   i 'm not familiar with the mechanics of bookmaking , but someone ca n't `` cancel '' or `` sell '' their bet back to the bookmaker , right ? 
  this depends on the market . 
  some of the online exchanges operate somewhat like futures markets , and you can lay off a bet with a bookmaker with someone else .

  i keep misreading the title of this post and thinking `` that 's a bit rude of austria-hungary '' . 
   i literally have nightmares about border controls going up again yeah , me too . 
  it 'd fuck things up for the border counties , yet again . 
   from what i heard life is very painful for north africans , the road is paved with racism i do n't think the french are particularly racist . 
  most of them are very tolerant , have grown up with kids from lots of different ethnic backgrounds , and work with people from other places . 
   wait 3.4 bn euros for the longest immersed road and rail tunnel ? 
  it does seem like a remarkably good deal . 
  the points system seems like a sensible approach . 
  however , this rules out a norwegian-style relationship , and i suppose the eu will have to introduce some similar points system for uk citizens . 
  it 's likely to add bureaucracy for many of my colleagues who travel regularly between the uk and europe . 
  i 'd say he was just after the money . 
  even if he met coulibaly he 'd have no reason to think he 's an isis fanatic ( assuming coulibaly would n't offer that information ) . 
  ah crap . 
  that 's bloody expensive . 
  maybe a gofundme campaign if brexit passes ? 
  can you apply for irish citizenship ? 
  should n't cost too much i 'd hope . 
  translation : claude hermant , a far-right activist is suspected of being the man who supplied weapons to the terrorist , according to information of bfm tv . 
  at the time , he served as an informant to the gendarmes . 
  he was suspected since late 2015 , to be the man who supplied weapons to amedy coulibaly , the terrorist who killed a municipal police officer in montrouge ( hauts-de-seine ) and four people in a hostage situation at the hypercacher , porte de vincennes , in january 2015 . 
  on tuesday , may 31 , bfmtv reveals that claude hermant provided the jihadist with four tokarev semi-automatic pistols and two kalashnikov assault rifles . 
  these weapons were found in the grocery store and in coulibaly stash , who was gunned down by reid and the bis in a violent clash on 9 january 2015 . 
  claude hermant , 52 , is a figure of the extreme right in lille . 
  when questioned by the anti-terrorism squad after his arrest on 15 december , the individual - who was already imprisoned in a weapons trafficking case - had assured them that his role was to buy dozens of weapons to sell to a single buyer named samyr . 
  this sale was , according to him , supervised and authorized by the police , because he himself was an informant for research section of lille ( nord ) . 
  ** information classified ` defense secrets ' ** according to bfmtv , a chief warrant officer acknowledged that claude hermant was one of its sources . 
  dawn hermant , the suspect 's wife , was arrested along with him . 
  she told investigators that `` the gendarmes did not do their job , '' supporting the contention that the security forces have allowed war weapons to enter the networks of claude hermant and end up in the hands of a terrorist . 
  no information was available about what the lille gendarmes knew about the `` clients '' of claude hermant or the projects of amedy coulibaly , the man who claim to belong to the islamic state group and took action in synch with the sharif brothers and said kouachi , the terrorists who stormed the offiicies of charlie hebdo . 
  some information on inquiries into attacks in january 2015 are classified defense secrets . 
  `` could be '' ? 
  of course it is !, 
  the question is whether there are sufficient number of terrorists and weapons to do something . 
   modern , intelligent individuals who have as their foremost preoccupation , a desire to be remarkable contributors for the advancement of human society lol , utopia it is so . 
  lol , reminds me of when mugabe offered to send observers to the count in florida during the bush/gore presidential election contest . 
   a plethora of visual arguments and accessories to pollute my field of vision with your bullshit identity . 
  ** blend in or fuck off ** what about dark-skinned folk in your utopia ? 
  or gingers/red heads ? 
   sachs cohen is n't american you mean sacha baron cohen i think . 
  love the fourth one , so typically french : `` well yes we 're in the middle of a riot , but it 's time for lunch ! '', 
  i also like the first lad tucking into a cornetto before the tear gassing starts .
