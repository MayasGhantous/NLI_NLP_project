   so you need to deter low spending tourists and attract high spending tourists . 
  at least speaking from a rational business perspective . 
  but the balearics have to somehow transform decades of attracting large numbers of lower-spend tourists to begin attracting smaller numbers of higer-spend tourists . 
  not an easy proposition . 
  this seems that it would be the least-worst outcome . 
  there 's lots of passenger traffic between the two islands , and these people will face delays , but reintroducing border controls inside ireland would be a disaster . 
  very good summary . 
  there was a received wisdom that hereditary wealth in the 20th century tended not to survive past four generations , but work like this and piketty 's is calling that into question . 
  look at the quotes and they 're patently not the same . 
  this is what i meant by a mashup . 
  the telegraph is taking a phrase from one question in an interview and combining it with another phrase from another question to portray juncker in the worst possible light . 
  this is standard practice for them . 
  i 'm hostile to the telegraph because it has form in this respect . 
  i 'm not especially hostile towards you except when you seem to be deliberately misunderstanding me . 
  really , when i said i 'm tired of it i meant it . 
  i just wanted to advise you not to trust the telegraph . 
  they do occasional good work ( mps expenses , for example ) but a lot of the time they 're following an agenda and the truth , or at least accuracy , takes second place . 
  cheers !, 
  i did finally too . 
  failing to read or comprehend clear english ? 
  you 've leaped to the telegraph 's defence , waggling the ft and reuters before us , without realising that there are major differences between each headline . 
  i 'm not whining mate , i 'm just bored with the whole thing . 
  they are relying on your inability to read the original interview , even though you can find it in a few minutes ' searching , to sell you a lie about what juncker said . 
  now maybe this lie suits your political perspective , so you do n't care , but what about the next lie they deliver , or the one after that ? 
  always go back to the original interview if you want a proper perspective . 
  every newspaper has an agenda . 
  the telegraph has given a mashup of two statements : 1 . 
  those who leave wo n't be welcomed back with open arms . 
  if brexit occurs , which i ( juncker ) hope it does n't , we will all draw conclusions . 
  arrives at the headline `` deserters will face consequences '' ... give me a break !, 
  fuck it , swallow the kool aid if you want . 
  i 'm tired of the whole thing . 
  i ca n't find it in le figaro . 
  looking for the le monde article . 
  the j\u00fcnkers were the prussian landed minor aristocracy . 
  people with a decent amount of land to live comfortably but not famously wealthy . 
  i know a few people with variations on the surname . 
  the telegraph distorts his words for political purposes . 
  of course this is exactly what he said . 
  like when the french guy said they 'd no longer process uk immigration in calais and the telegraph reported `` french will ship migrants to dover '' roll on the end of june . 
  this nonsense is getting tiresome . 
  i lived up near the belgian border for a while too . 
  serious beer country up there . 
  there are some fantastic french beers from alsace and lorraine that germans would love . 
  and some from french flanders that the belgians would love . 
  well okay so , but no harassing the one-eyed monk . 
   they are not going to just call up vote leave and say `` over to you guys , please get on with your plan '' . 
  do n't you think cameron will resign and bojo will be elected tory leader ? 
  big cabinet reshuffle with all the exit heads getting front bench seats . 
  they can watch old eurovision contests and stop spanking the monkey ;-), 
  cross post to / r/nofap ? 
   something like a visa but only available to eu citizens who were in the uk before brexit so you expect they 'll require some sort of residency & work permit . 
  but in order to treat commonwealth and eu citizens with some level of equity , should n't the 35k rule be implemented for the issuing of permits to eu citizens ? 
  we 've heard a lot about how eu immigration has depressed wages for the uk working class . 
  if everyone who 's come in is allowed to stay , how will that change ? 
  is n't there an underlying assumption is several of the exit economic arguments that the eu migrants will leave and take pressure off public services while allowing wages to rise ? 
   how is it that it 's only ever foreigners that keep bringing this up ? 
  the poster asked :   what on earth is everyone 's problem with hungary ? 
  so i answered . 
   what on earth is everyone 's problem with hungary ? 
  press freedom is a big one . 
  here 's [ reporters without borders  ( http://budapestbeacon.com/news-in-brief/hungary-press-freedom-ranks-65th-out-of-180-according-to-reporters-without-borders/19382 )  democracy has been in retreat in hungary ever since viktor orb\u00e1n 's fidesz party came to power in 2010 , with the result that the country has fallen 42 places in the index in the past four years here 's the [ u.s. 
  ambassador to hungary ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/blog/shedding-light-hungary-viktor-orban ) :  but her account makes clear that orb\u00e1n is not at heart a man committed to democratic principles . 
  instead he is a majoritarian who rejects the definition of democracy as a system that is subject to the discipline of a political opposition , a free press , and especially an independent judiciary . 
  the [ index on censorship  ( https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/01/constant-harassment-of-independent-media-in-hungary/ )  hungary 's media outlets are coming under increasing pressure from lawsuits , restrictions on what they can publish and high fees for freedom of information requests , according to a survey of the 15 verified reports to index on censorship 's media monitoring project during the fourth quarter of 2015 . 
   if the employee is expected to be available on call or mails 24h/24h , he should then be paid accordingly . 
  exactly . 
  some of my colleagues do weekend support and they get paid for being on call . 
  you have to love the spin that the media and the exit campaign have placed on this . 
  here 's the [ original question/answer ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/lords/2016-04-27/hl8054/ ) : ** question **  to ask her majesty 's government whether it is their intention that , in the event of the uk leaving the eu , citizens of eu member states who had previously settled in the uk would be entitled automatically to remain ; and if not , what contingency plans they are making to defend any legal challenges or claims for compensation under the european convention on human rights that might arise from individuals who are subject to removal . 
  ** answer **  as set out in the government 's white paper : ` the process for withdrawing from the european union ' , published on 29 february , the withdrawal process is unprecedented . 
  no country has ever used article 50 -- it is untested . 
  there is a great deal of uncertainty about how it would work . 
   uk citizens get the right to live and work in the other 27 member states from our membership of the eu . 
  if the uk voted to leave the eu , the government would do all it could to secure a positive outcome for the country , but there would be no requirement under eu law for these rights to be maintained . 
  somehow we go from `` there is a great deal of uncertainty '' to `` three million people could be deported '' !, 
  er , 16k ? 
  i think phds and postdocs are excluded from the 35k a year requirement . 
  you mean that if britain leaves the eu , migrants from eu countries who are already there wo n't have to apply for some form of working visa or residency permit ? 
  that would be a surprise to me . 
  so the exit crowd just want to stem future migration flows and they 're okay with the status quo ? 
   if you 're here before brexit ^ ^ and ^ ^ you ^ ^ make ^ ^ more ^ ^ than ^ ^ 35k ^ ^ gbp then you have a legitimate right to be here . 
  ftfy, 
   it applies to people trying to a certain work visa and always had no , i think it just came into force in april . 
  here 's the [ original announcement ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/immigration-employment-related-settlement-overseas-domestic-workers-tier-5-of-the-points-based-system-and-visitors-wms ) from 2012 , where theresa may said it would be applied starting from april 2016 . 
  anyway , the point is that any eu migrant who is earning under 35k will have to reevaluate their position if the vote is to leave . 
  given that [ 76 % of uk earners ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax ) were on less than 35k in 2013-14 , i 'm guessing there 's a fair chunk of eu migrants who 'll be affected . 
  presumably the 35k gbp `` earnings threshold '' that now applies to ( most ) non-eea migrants will be applied to eu citizens in the event of a brexit ? 
  i was amazed this did n't win at the time . 
  thought it was in the bag .
