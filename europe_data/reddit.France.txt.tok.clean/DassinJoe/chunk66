  cheese, 
  from his [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beppe_grillo ) page :  in 2003 , he settled a libel suit for defamation filed against him by rita levi-montalcini . 
  during a show , beppe grillo called the 94-year-old winner of the 1986 nobel prize in physiology or medicine and italian senator for life ( 2001 -- 2012 ) an `` old whore '' . 
  i 'm guessing he 's a pretty classy guy all round then ? 
  fascinating read , thanks . 
  the bargaining model adds a dimension that we should be considering in light of the developments of the last 40-50 years . 
  from [ \u00c9riu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89riu ) , a goddess in irish mythology . 
  maybe he sent it as a friendship gesture ? 
  these lads are better than nicky byrne was ( irish entry ) . 
  that 's a great version of rocky road to dublin . 
  the british 1885 legislation outlawing homosexuality between men did n't make any mention of lesbianism . 
  there 's a story that this is because queen victoria refused to believe women would engage in sex with other women , but this is very likely a myth . 
   i remember sarkozy going all `` let 's do what the germans did '' and then receiving backslash after backslash . 
  \\ \\ \\ * take that sarko * \\ \\ \\ \\ ( backlash is a negative reaction ), 
  / u/suberee did n't get a letter ... 
  i 'm sure it 's been done many times already . 
  she gets trolled by arseholes on twitter all the time . 
  sauternes and roquefort from france . 
  guinness and clonakilty sausages from ireland . 
  if she 'd stuck with gringotts she 'd never have been caught . 
  safest bank in the world is gringotts . 
  did they just recently give the royal camerapeople microphones but forget to tell them ? 
  there was another story about cameron dissing the nigerians and afghanis to the queen . 
   why is the eu alergic to the free market ? 
  the eu is trying to encourage market competition by blocking this sale . 
  here 's a [ detailed list ] ( https://rainbow-europe.org/about ) of the criteria . 
  it 's very legalistic although it 's supposed to include the `` social climate '' as well . 
  :-) okay fair enough . 
  if i was in their position , i 'd be arguing against the euro on the grounds that it dampens german wages and purchasing power . 
  there was a case recently in the u.s. 
  someone transitioning from female to male had a surprise pregnancy . 
  i 'll try to track it down .

  but is n't < < the middle class in germany is shrinking   used by afd as an argument < < against the euro currency   ? 
  one problem is that it 's conceptually difficult to explain how a depressed euro has benefited germany . 
  the argument that germany would have become less internationally competitive if it had retained a floating dm is too abstract , while pointing out that as a consequence of this germany should be prepared to assist endebted euro zone nations leads to outrage . 
  what argument are you pretending i made ? 
  if you investigate it i expect you 'll find that muslims live near non-muslims all over britain , whether in social or private housing . 
   what do you think would happen if you forced the uk 's muslim population to live among the kaffir ? 
  you mean like the new mayor of london ? 
  if he was n't being investigated for his statements , he 'd need to amp them up a notch . 
   for him to say this is very radical . 
  no it 's not . 
  what he 's saying now is close to what he was arguing when he was head of the commission for racial equality in 2004 . 
  here 's [ an interview ] ( http://uk.politics.misc.narkive.com/bzyk8chs/britain-must-scrap-multiculturalism ) that was published in the times in 2004 . 
   trevor phillips , the chairman of the commission for racial equality , said that multiculturalism was out of date and no longer useful , not least because it encouraged `` separateness '' between communities . 
  and here he is in 2006 backing off from his statement in 2005 that britain is [ `` sleepwalking into segregation '' ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5297760.stm ) . 
  the cabinet will be helped by the weather - it 's been raining all day and protesters will be fewer as a result . 
   gee i wonder why people feel this way . 
  guess you could ask the first nations ? 
   drawing a direct parallel with enoch powell 's notorious `` rivers of blood '' speech , he likens britain 's politicians , media and educated elite in general to the emperor nero fiddling while rome burned , unable even to recognise the `` dark side of the diverse society '' . 
  i find this confusing . 
  is n't the main interest of powell 's speech that the `` tiber foaming with much blood '' never materialised ? 
  well , that and the fact that powell 's career was basically over after the speech . 
  he killed the woman who owned the car , iirc . 
  yeah they 've got this `` small dog who does n't realise he 's a small dog '' thing going on . 
   ~ ~ puss ~ ~ ** pug ** ification of the world continues . 
  i for one welcome our new smushed-face overlords . 
   would n't we have to patrol the borders ? 
  that 's the 20 euro ( 10 pound sterling ) question . 
  the common travel area predates membership of the eec/eu , but given that ireland will remain in the eu , my assumption is that there 'll be some sort of border controls reinstated between the republic and northern ireland . 
  this throws the good friday agreement into question , because the dismantling of borders was part of that deal . 
  it 's got the potential to develop into a minor clusterfuck . 
   good luck france with your muslims  charming, 
  in france , the driving school cars that i 've seen have a full set of pedals plus an small wheel override that sits on the instructor 's dash . 
  it 's a miniature wheel , basically , with buttons for the indicators . 
  it 's possible to rent one of these cars to give someone lessons . 
  yeah , it 's pretty easy . 
  i would guess that ukip is in favour of keeping the old arrangements between britain and ireland , but the issue is that ireland may suddenly become an eu land border with the uk . 
  anyone will be able to come to ireland from with the eu without a visa ; if the uk is serious about controlling its borders , they 'll have to look at ireland as the greatest point of risk . 
  interesting times . 
  interesting piece in the irish times today : [ border towns anxiously await referendum ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/brexit-and-ireland-border-towns-anxiously-await-referendum-1.2640224 ) i honestly do n't see how the common travel area can be kept in the event that the uk withdraws . 
  unless they avoid checking on the irish borders and just check when someone arrives by ferry or plane on the island of britain . 
  yeah , it 's a bit mental , but the bigger question for me is what happens to the border in the event of a leave vote . 
  ireland both north and south voted to dismantle the checkpoints , but i do n't see how they can avoid reinstating them if the uk pulls out of the eu . 
  i saw the marbles last year - they 're very impressive . 
  [ it 's the only way to be sure . 
   de facto it meant that you would n't move and then look for a job . 
  maastricht was a game changer . 
  i 'm not sure i follow your reasoning . 
  pre-maastricht plenty of people moved country and then looked for work . 
  i did it myself in luxembourg , germany , and france . 
  i had to have the means to support myself ( i.e. 
  i could n't claim welfare in the new country ) , but that 's still the case today . 
  maastricht did n't change that much . 
   however for me these problems are relatively secondary . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm interested because i 've noticed several posters , including you , say that they 're okay with `` the eec '' but not with `` the eu '' , and i honestly ca n't tell what the issue is with the latter that did n't exist in the former . 
  maybe countries are ** more ** supportive of free movement than they were in the 1980s , but that would be expected anyway given how long it has been established . 
   in rome , for all industries but in origin and without residence . 
  article 45 on the functioning of the eu is roughly verbatim article 48 of the treaties establishing the eec . 
  there 's no difference that i can find with respect to residence . 
  prior to directive 2004/38/ec , there was [ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a31968l0360] ( 1968/360/eec ) , which covers rights of workers ' families . 
  unless you mean `` residence '' in the sense of `` residing in a country without also working in that country '' ? 
  in this case people are legally required to be able to support themselves .
