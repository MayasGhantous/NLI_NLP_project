  maybe your problem is with enlargement rather than with freedom of movement per se ? 
   the eec did n't include fmp/fmw . 
  that 's a maastricht development . 
  not it 's not . 
  title iii of the treaties establishing the eec covers the free movement of persons , services , and capital . 
  here 's a [ pdf ] ( http://www.cvce.eu/obj/treaty_establishing_the_european_economic_community_rome_25_march_1957-en-cca6ba28-0bf3-4ce6-8a76-6b0b3252696e.html ) . 
  did you never see auf wiedersehen pet ? 
   the ideal outcome would be a total dissolution of the current institutions , going back to the eec essentially . 
  including the free movement of workers ? 
  here 's a website with lots of information about the series : http://www.yes-minister.com/episodes.htm i borrowed the diary form of the series from a library many years ago - it 's [ worth a read ] ( http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~uzimmerm/notes/yes%20minister.pdf ) . 
  obviously mathematics has n't come far enough from its middle eastern roots for this lady . 
  random factoid : we owe the word `` algorithm '' to al-\u1e34w\u0101rizm\u012b ` the man of \u1e34w\u0101rizm ' ( now khiva ) , a name given to the 9th-century mathematician ab\u016b ja ` far muhammad ibn m\u016bsa . 
  looks like they even walk through the same square . 
   according to belgian authorities , the recent security crackdown on the channel tunnel has prompted people smugglers hoping to ferry their cargo into britain to change tack and move via belgium . 
  according to a trucker i know , they 've been going via zeebrugge for years but it 's been a low-key operation and very expensive for the would-be migrant . 
   making it sound as if all the charges on everyone involved were dropped . 
  really ? 
  i do n't get that impression at all . 
  reading the title makes me think one charge has been dropped against one person . 
   like they do with car `` kjar '' there 's a track by the undertones where fergal sharkey does this . 
  ca n't remember which song it is at the moment , but it 's almost like he 's saying `` cearr '' in irish . 
  you should check out [ the undertones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1zdaszwo7w ) if you like the derry accent . 
  there was a [ greater london council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_london_council ) until 1986 . 
  the leader of the glc was the de facto mayor of london . 
  in the 1980s , ken livingstone was in such continual conflict with margaret thatcher that the tory government abolished the glc . 
  tony blair 's government brought back a centralized london administration in 2000 . 
  first time the two irish teams will be present at this tournament . 
   i 've never seen anybody arguing on the fact that the uk wanted to go back to having an empire , or that being obsessed with it led to brexit . 
  i think it 's rooted in the claim that the uk will be able to do lots of lucrative trade deals with former colonies . 
  i 've read recently that this idea is referred to as empire 2.0 in whitehall ( centre of the british civil service ) . 
  edit : here it is [ all over the uk press ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=%22empire+2.0%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=dffswkhxj8rkub-trogh ) ( guardian , ft , times , daily mail , usw ) . 
  saw her in the jardin de tuileries some years back . 
  she 's very attractive . 
   we had ` the troubles ' so surely the great famine should be called ` the hunger ' . 
  it is in irish : * an gorta m\u00f3r * = the great hunger . 
  gorta is n't regular hunger ( * ocras * in irish ) , like you 'd feel in the evening if you 'd missed lunch , but an extreme hunger like from not eating for several days . 
  i 'd become a priest and invent a time machine , just so i could abandon the priesthood and travel back in time for gina . 
  it was n't just in france . 
  in the mid 90s , we had to apply for a us special export license for a product we sold from both europe and the us because it included some encryption . 
  i 'd become a priest just so i could abandon the priesthood for gina . 
  i 'll take `` what is core-periphery theory '' for 200 alex. 
   as the proportion of eu workers in the tech sector is far higher than the average -- up to a third in london alone -- many businesses will want an early resolution to the issue of the status of eu workers in addition to clarity over their ability to recruit overseas talent post-brexit . 
  fuck the chechen government . 
  i 'm a graduate of the [ philosophy department of the university of woolloomooloo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyvx3ujpqxc ) . 
   i estimated it would take about 5 more attacks across the continent where are you in your count of attacks ? 
    their nieces lol, 
  very nice . 
  kyle is from gaelic * caol * , for slender or in this case a strait . 
   ** most of these people are ** fake sudo intellectual art types ** who generalise people ** / r/unintendedirony, 
  yeah , i 've always found poles to be really positive towards the irish . 
  this is a very late article ? 
  [ here 's a review from the end of february ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/european-bonds-unwind-political-risk-as-french-spread-narrows ) . 
  and [ here 's a chart for the 10yr ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/france-government-bond-yield.png?s=gfrn10&amp;v=201704101041t&amp;d1=20160101&amp;d2=20171231 ) . 
  it 's volatile , but there seems to be plenty of buyers for the moment . 
  congrats , you just did . 
   they are only not populists insofar as their proposed policies are quite unpopular their proposed policies are quite unpopular because they are ideologues rather than populists . 
  it 's quite possible for ideologues to lack substance , but it does n't make them populists . 
  for people wondering why she would even bother saying such a thing , this is [ dog-whistle politics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dog-whistle_politics ) . 
  the subtext here is that mlp does n't care if she insults french jews . 
  she is publicly giving her * nationalism * precedence over her perceived fairness because she needs to remind some of her base support that the fn remains antisemitic , even if `` officially '' it has left such sentiments behind . 
  she did drop opposition to gay marriage for a while , but now she is arguing against gay marriage in favour of the super-pacs . 
  it 's very far down in her manifesto - she does n't want to draw attention to it , but it 's there if anyone is looking for it . 
  in the article i read , one official said that the presence of the uk needs to be discussed . 
  i would n't consider this as representative of what the eu wants or does n't want . 
  why do you think the eu does n't agree ? 
  is this the train on line l ? 
  st. lazare going north and west ? 
  they are lovely inside . 
   while in the eu the uk should still be represented in trade talks . 
  i agree . 
  and while in the eu , the uk should only participate in trade talks as part of the eu . 
  stay safe swedes . 
  i 'm glad whatever this device was it does n't seem to have had any effect . 
  you want a closed economy . 
  north korea is probably the most closed in the world . 
  they have regular famines . 
  you think that the only benefit of the single market is that everyone buys german food ? 
  north korea is the sort of economy you are hoping for . 
  okay . 
  do you live in a country that can produce all the different foods you like ? 
  so you do n't want a common market ? 
  back to protectionism and small national markets ? 
  sturgeon i think ? 
  edit : looked it up . 
  sturgeon , whales , porpoises , and dolphins all belong to the queen . 
   the cause of death will be investigated . 
  is fowl play suspected ? 
  difficult to have a common market without some shared values , laws and policies . 
  of course , but if you look at the evolution of christian thought , you can see how desperately they tried to square the circle . 
  starting with the [ council of nicea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_council_of_nicaea ) , the catholic church tried to rationalise doctrine to make it more internally consistent . 
  first , it 's a useful scapegoat for national politicians . 
  they can blame the eu for legislation they do n't like , while accepting praise for popular legislation that comes from the eu . 
  at the extreme level , politicians paint the eu as the cause of all society 's ills . 
  the fn in france pushes an idea that outside the eu france could return to the industrial heyday of the 50s and 60s with full employment , zero crime , and a coq au vin in every pot . 
  this is nonsense , of course , but the fn is in the business of selling dreams and not reality . 
  second , there 's a sense of the eu as lacking democratic accountability . 
  this is encouraged by some national politicians . 
  the usual claim is that unelected bureaucrats are forcing their will on the nation , never mind that every member state is represented in the commission and in the council and in the parliament . 
  third , there are issues with the eu and they are complex . 
  if they were easy to fix it would 've happened already , but moving a huge transnational organisation in the same direction is difficult .
