  i grew up in a place where religion dominated politics up to the 1990s , so it 's interesting for me to be in a place where religion is less influential . 
   softened their support of '' laicite '' and embraced a more american style of secularism . 
  what do you consider are the key differences between * la\u00efcit\u00e9 * and us secularism . 
  1mm used to be common , but now 1m is more common . 
  in your estimation , how many of them `` made it '' across while you were working at the camp ? 
  how do they keep their hopes up , given what seems to me to be an almost impossible task of getting to the uk ? 
  yeah , i 've taken the tunnel many times but never seen the camps . 
  on the list of things i do not give a flying fuck about , i 've got to say that the colour of my passport ranks somewhere between * whatever happened to keith chegwin ? 
  * and * what 's happening in american college football this week ? 
  sorry man , it was a joke . 
  i took his answer :  out of context neatly forgetting the question it was an answer to . 
  y' know , for lols . 
  i thought it was cute . 
   step 1 ) ...  ... pitchforks . 
  why are you in such a rush to reach for the pitchforks ? 
  then i must conclude that 1950-65 is both a golden age ( for regular people who live in britain ) and ( inter ) national decline ( for those who do n't care about regular people but prefer pissing contests with other countries ) . 
   that 's only because the country was building from an all time low . 
  not an all-time low , obviously . 
  in fact , because of the mobilisation of resources during the war , britain emerges with national income in 1946 at an ** all time high ** . 
   it 's very easy to make gains in living standards when most of the largest cities lay in ruins . 
  that might have some positive effect for a few years , but it 's not the main story . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.roiw.org/5/2.pdf ) for national income statistics ( page 9 ) . 
  post wwii , britain is also emerging from the great depression , which saw a decline in national income from 1930-35 . 
  the demand-led production policies of the war were carried on by the post-war governments . 
  this is the heyday of keynesian economics , which promises to end the cycle of boom and bust ( it does n't , but that 's another story ) . 
  the workforce is modernising , with over a million people leaving domestic service , and exports are booming ( see page 49 [ here ] ( https://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/imts/historical%20data%201900-1960.pdf ) . 
  it 's a whole lot more than `` reconstruction '' after the war - it 's a genuine economic revolution . 
  free with this week 's sunday telegraph : ** a brexit security blanket !, 
  ** it 's quite cute watching them try to reassure themselves . 
  pass the prosecco . 
  the big story in rotherham is n't the political correctness , it 's the failure in the duty of care for young people . 
  the pc stuff is a handy excuse for inaction by the police and social services `` we were afraid of being considered racist if we followed up in the report '' . 
  in reality it was administrative laziness and a lack of concern for `` problem children '' who had nobody powerful going to bat for them . 
  i 'm not a fan of locking people up for no reason , but in the case of a failed asylum seeker who is known to be radicalised and is very mobile , every effort should be made to detain him until he can be deported . 
  the * only shows if the edit happened a few minutes later . 
  i 've replied to sentences/phrases in the past that were deleted before my reply was posted . 
  edit : now that post i replied to was deleted oh the irony !, 
  it 's a strange set of values that considers the period 1950-65 in the uk as one of national decline . 
  the average person is better off , motorways are being built , jobs are easy to get , the welfare of the population is increasing rapidly . 
  there are hidden problems of course , but for the general population sees a historically unprecedented improvement in living standards . 
  saying `` yeah , but the japanese made more improvements in productivity '' simply misses the point that the average briton can enjoy luxuries that s/he has never had access to before . 
  this is the era when teenagers became a target market , because young people could find jobs on leaving school at 16 . 
  just the union jack i think . 
  surprised how seriously people are taking a joke . 
  this has been my silver lining all along . 
  i might take the mickey out of brexiteers , because i find them predominantly ideological rather than logical , but i 'd much prefer britain to have stayed in the eu . 
  if that 's not happening , i 'm engaging in an ideological fancy of my own : 26 + 6 = 1 . 
  eventually . 
  no , it 's relative to the nation itself . 
  however , britain can suffer ( inter ) national decline in the sense of its control of other nations ( notably india ) while at the same time enjoying a national resurgence in the sense of improving the national economy and the living conditions of british citizens . 
  my interest will always be in the general economic well being of citizens , so my definition of national decline/resurgence is focused on british people during 1950-65 . 
  your view may be different , if you 're not concerned with people but with , for example , empire . 
  national is pertaining to the nation . 
  a national disgrace , national treasure , national pride , national growth , national decline . 
  you could simply admit you were wrong instead of scrabbling around for an excuse . 
  you wrote `` national decline '' not `` did n't grow as quickly as others '' . 
  full employment , noticeable increases in material well-being for much of the population , rising real gdp , declining debt to gdp ratios . 
  we should all wish for such a period of `` national decline '' !, 
   i do n't know where you 've heard that , but it 's wrong . 
  no it very simply is not . 
   [ the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s . 
  the one prolonged period of full employment was the 1950s and 1960s . 
  this was helped by the global post-war economic boom and also the commitment to full employment which was an important feature of the post-war consensus . 
  ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/780/unemployment/unemployment-rates-history/ ) ...  [ from the early 1950s to early 1990s , we see a consistent decrease in the debt to gdp ratio . 
  the main reason uk debt to gdp fell in the post-war period was the sustained period of economic growth and near full employment until the late 1970s . 
  ... uk growth was so rapid , we experienced labour shortages . 
  this lead to the mass immigration of the 1950s and 60s to help deal with the labour market shortages . 
  this helped increase the working population and increase real gdp . 
  gdp per capita rose at a slower pace than actual real gdp .

  there was an interesting analysis of marine le pen supporting twitter accounts posted recently . 
  they 're quite effective at getting her trending on twitter . 
  edit : here 's the article : https://medium.com/dfrlab/le-pens-small-online-army-c754058630f0, 
    uk economy was in the shitter in the 70s ,  one could easily say that was all a hangover from ww2 and the loss of empire except that the 1950s and early 60s are considered a golden age for britain 's economy . 
  edit : lolling at the economic illiterates downvoting me . 
  you people do n't know your own economic history . 
  projecting much ? 
  you 're claiming two sides of the same argument . 
  for vote a , you argue that the views of 38 % of people must be taken into account . 
  for vote b , you argue that the views of 48 % of people wo n't be taken into account because `` that 's democracy '' . 
  i 'd hope for free movement of intermediary goods , i.e. 
  those that are inputs to a final product . 
  various agricultural processing industries have evolved considerably since the border came down . 
  putting a border back in place will cause economic difficulties on both sides . 
  yeah sure , but your point was very specifically about pubs . 
  here it is :  we have a long history with terrorist attacks , mainly the ira , when you live under the looming threat of your pub being bombed , knowing gchq might be looking at private details does n't seem such a big deal you said that if people expect that their pub will be bombed at any moment , they do n't care about gchq invading their privacy . 
  i 'm drawing attention to your double standard . 
    bashthealtrightfash   48 % is quite a lot too , but the 52 % was seen as far more important . 
   bunt_smuggler  that 's a democracy for you . 
  wangles, 
  i edited it !, 
  hopefully nobody noticed !, 
   i 'm more than happy to hear a reason as to why over a million people is not relevant that 's a democracy for you . 
  ~ ~ leitrim does n't really exist . 
  it 's just a story to scare europeans . ~ ~ nothing to see here . 
  carry on . 
  to obey authority ? 
  dumb tweets but who the fuck went after her for joking about a 40-year-old story ? 
  [ time flies by ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpx7um-5y3q ) when you 're a driver of a train speeding out of trumpton with a cargo of cocaine, 
   divorce settlement must come before talks about future relationship , says chancellor yeah i think most ( maybe all ) of the uk press are portraying events as more confrontational than they really are .
