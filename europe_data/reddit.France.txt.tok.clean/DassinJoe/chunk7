  their data is absolutely shit , for example : * rather than do their own iq studies , the authors average and adjust existing studies and use other methods to create estimates . 
  * for 104 of the 185 nations , no studies were available . 
  in those cases , the authors have used an estimated value by taking averages of the iqs of neighboring or comparable nations . 
  * a test of 108 9 - to 15-year-olds in barbados , of 50 13 - to 16-year-olds in colombia , of 104 5 - to 17-year-olds in ecuador , of 129 6 - to 12-year-olds in egypt , and of 48 10 - to 14-year-olds in equatorial guinea , all were taken as measures of national iq . 
  * writing in the economic journal , astrid oline ervik ... criticizes the book for a number of reasons : that the authors do n't establish cross country comparability and reliability of iq scores , that they rely on simple bivariate correlations , that they do not consider or control for other hypotheses , and that they confuse correlation with causation . 
  honestly , this is n't proper research . 
  it 's foolishness . 
   we did n't do this during the first gulf war , ** or the 2nd . 
  ** maybe scotland did n't , [ but sweden did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_iraqis ) . 
  about 800000 people fled the bosnian conflict , with about 350000 of them ending up in germany . 
  it would be surprising if he 'd left lashkar-e-taiba for isil in a cooperative exchange . 
  let is heavily sponsored by the pakistani security service and is close to the al-qaeda factions that are fighting isil . 
  it 's got important tax and citizenship implications . 
  blog is from march 26th . 
  he was released without charge and is threatening to sue the police iirc . 
   it is not clear if mr ghani , the arrested man , is thought to have defected from the pakistani group to isil . 
  strangely phrased . 
  first the article asserts that he 's with isis , then it 's not clear whether he defected ? 
  possible targets were la defense ( business district ) or a catholic organisation . 
  the guy who got blown up in an apartment last november was thought to have been targeting la defense . 
  twenty three percent undecided . 
  will they vote ? 
  cameron is an unfortunate figurehead for the ` stay ' campaign , as his tax issues are gathering criticism ( it does n't matter that he did n't do anything wrong ) . 
  but i 've yet to see anyone in the ` leave ' campaign who could convince large numbers of the undecided . 
  a low turnout will probably favour exit , as its supporters are more emotionally involved than the remainers . 
  in fact , the exit campaign is largely driven by emotion because there are so many unknowns about the future . 
  the betting markets still indicate `` remain '' , but they were wrong on the last uk ge so i 'm taking that with a pinch of salt . 
   president ^ for ^ life trump has ordered a wall to be built ftfy, 
   i think the key is not segregate people like it happens on france and belgium . 
  part of freedom is allowing people to settle where they want . 
  so even if you do n't start with enclaves of immigrants with one nationality/religion , it can develop over time . 
  people flock together : it 's natural . 
  belgium : linguistic diversity germany : engineering luxembourg : nice for rich people switzerland : democracy italy : design andorra : skiing spain : joie de vivre, 
  there 's a til on the front page about a male guinea pig called randy who broke into an enclosure of females and impregnated 100 + of them . 
  # # guineapigfacts edit : here 's the story : http://www.itv.com/news/2014-06-06/guinea-pig-to-become-father-to-400-after-breaking-into-female-enclosure/,

  [ la maison du chocolat ] ( http://www.lamaisonduchocolat.com/fr/index.php#/home ) is worth a visit in paris . 
  there are many good artisinal chocolate makers all over france . 
  [ valrhona ] ( http://www.valrhona.com/accueil.aspx ) and [ richart ] ( https://www.richart-chocolates.com/chocolates/ ) have very good reputations . 
  insanely good with coffee . 
  note that the guy was on a trial period which can be ended at will by either party . 
  the employer does n't need a justification for terminating the employment . 
  yes , [ college fees for his kids apparently ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/22/tim-roth-fifa-movie-united-passions-to-pay-for-kids-college ) .

  did anyone see the sepp blatter movie ? 
  it earned a grand total of [ $ 607 in its opening weekend ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/06/08/fifas-terrible-sepp-blatter-movie-made-607-in-u-s-debut-weekend/ ) in the us . 
   cameron also admitted he did not know whether the # 300,000 he inherited from his father had benefited from tax haven status due to part of his estate being based in a unit trust in jersey . 
  i could probably help out here : * if some of your inheritance is coming from a unit trust based in jersey , and you 've no family connections with jersey , it 's very very very very very likely that you 're benefitting from tax haven status . 
  read the article . 
  it 's purely anecdotal . 
  by interviewing the kids themselves to establish some proper data ? 
  this article is very poor . 
  in fairness this is severely anecdotal . 
  one guy 's reported speech from his friends and acquaintances ? 
  the number of public holidays that are non-working days ( for most people ) in france varies from one year to the next . 
  this year there will be 8 , because may 1st , 8th , and december 25th will fall on a weekend . 
  some employers give compensatory days when this happens , so i guess the average comes up to 10 , as presented in the op 's link . 
   i still do n't understand why it should be the state 's business to `` deter men from seeking out sex for sale '' if the person doing the selling is ** acting of their own volition . 
  ** that 's the point of this law under discussion in germany . 
  if you get caught fucking a woman who is obviously not acting of her own volition , you 'll be jailed . 
  voluntary prostitution is legal in germany , but forced prostitution is not . 
   it 's becoming socially acceptable to do these things ... in europe . 
  no it 's not . 
  the guy is up on charges for murder . 
  okay , so there are 1.6 billion violent , murderous muslims in the world according to you . 
  you must live in a state of constant fear . 
  lol , it was a damn big plant , i swear !,

  love it !, 
  great idea to use portrait rather than landscape . 
  you can buy otc paternity tests in the u.s.

  it 's both . 
  he 's a crazy person and he 's acting to defend his religion . 
  is this sort of violence inherent to islam ? 
  yes , if you go looking for a way to justify violence you 'll find it . 
  are there over a billion peaceful muslims on the planet ? 
  obviously yes . 
  what can we conclude from this apparent contradiction ? 
  maybe that there are no simple answers like `` islam is bad '' or `` terrorism has nothing to do with islam '' . 
  interesting piece . 
  i wonder how this will turn out :  the same men who attacked the trucks took samples of the wine to test it and prove their accusations that spanish winemakers are mixing their wine with products from latin america without advertising that to customers . 
  i do n't see much spanish wine for sale in places where i buy wine , but i 'm always amazed at how cheap australian and south african wine can be . 
  i 've seen yellow tail selling in france at 2.50 eur a bottle . 
  how can that possibly be profitable for the aussies ? 
  i 've also found south african pinotage at about the same price .

  marine has worked hard to sanitize and professionalize the fn , but he shoots his mouth off regularly and reminds everyone where the fn 's roots are : vichy collaborationists , oas , and neo-nazis . 
  it 's not making prostitution illegal , it 's making the purchase of sex illegal . 
  prostitution will remain legal , so the person providing the service wo n't be punished but the person buying the service could be . 
  i do n't know if this is a good idea . 
  i think making sex transactions more risky for the buyers will also make those transactions more risky for the sellers . 
  once something is made criminal , it usually becomes more dangerous for everyone involved . 
  this law is taking forever . 
  i thought they 'd abandoned it in 2014 .
