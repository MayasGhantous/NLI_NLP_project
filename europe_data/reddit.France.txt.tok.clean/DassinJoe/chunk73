  thank you for this . 
  for years in the 1970s and 80s everyone pleaded with sinn f\u00e9in and the ira to put down the guns and engage in the political process . 
  they finally did so in the 1990s , and they 've done so for over 25 years now . 
  but for some people it 's never enough - they have to put the boot into a dead man . 
  what people fail to appreciate about mcguinness is the work he had to do to ( and risks he had to take ) to convince die-hard republicans to give the peace process a chance . 
  mcguinness was the public face of the ira , but there were plenty of other characters in the background who had to be brought onside for peace to stand a chance . 
   he was also behind the murder of innocent people . 
  as was the british army and the british government . 
  just for the record , i 've spent most of my life in the top two ... 
  it was lord kerr of kinlochard who wrote article 50 . 
  he 's in the british house of lords so you can take it up with him . 
  [ is it this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_ecoboost_engine ) ? 
  okay . 
  i ask because plenty of protestants stayed and did n't lose their industry and heritage . 
  [ ford of europe facilities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_of_europe#facilities ) inside the eu , it looks like germany , uk , romania , france , spain , but this will depend on the model . 
  out of interest , have you met any protestants from the republic of ireland ? 
  a non-voter 's view : i do n't know m\u00e9lenchon at all but i thought he did very well . 
  he was clear and rational and presented his positions very logically . 
  a very `` formalist french '' approach to everything . 
  macron i have seen before . 
  previously i thought he was a bit lightweight but i was more impressed last night . 
  he certainly got better after the first 30 minutes , and he was persuasive at times . 
  hamon was quite impressive too , though he had difficulty defending the current government 's record ( let 's face it , fabien barthez at his best would have difficulty defending the current government 's record ) . 
  fillon was very clear and reasonable at times , but he seemed against the mood of the room when he emphasized fiscal austerity . 
  le pen was less of an orator than i expected . 
  i thought she mumbled a lot and she got flustered when dealing with certain topics . 
  immigration and law & order were clearly her favourite subjects , and she presented well on these . 
  when pushed on other subjects she was less comfortable . 
  um , read the subhead ? 
   former ukip leader 's comments prompted nine complaints from listeners . 
  this suggests ofcom is investigating because there were complaints from listeners . 
  i looked at the ford europe supply chain recently , and it 's going to be very complicated unless some agreement is reached . 
  it 's got no suggestions at all !, 
  taken at the intersection of [ fairfield rd and the a6 ( london rd ) ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/piccadilly+place+car+park/@53.4763323,-2.2310374,3a,60y,311.75h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2a-sysalmtc_wzu1gkygza!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xe83bc5e58377252b!8m2!3d53.4771865!4d-2.232995!6m1!1e1 ) ? 
   a windy motorway bridge is not a teenager 's normal idea of a fun place for a friday night . 
  but justine dieulafait ... is the daughter of [ pierre dieulafait , the 3rd placed fn candidate in combourg in 2015 ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b_eot2ow8aarkow.jpg ) . 
  so the story is not simply the fn 's appeal to the youth vote , it 's also [ a family affair ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yst-jq1brea ) . 
  i just entered `` article fifty '' into google search and the second suggestion is ** `` article fifty shades of grey '' ** . 
  now i feel dirty and need to go take a shower .

  i did n't tell you what to do . 
  i completed your sentence for you . 
   i cant even :d ... express yourself like an adult . 
  yeah whatever . 
  which video ? 
  the one where the american breathlessly exaggerates what looks like a fairly standard clash between the police and extremist protesters in paris ? 
  look at the french press to get an idea of how much of a `` riot '' it was .

   it is better to be unemployed in france than working in england/germany except if you get 3000 $ net a month that 's more to do with the local food i think . 
   `` they used to turn up at gay pride parades , show their muscle , turn up the heat , '' not sure i 'm reading that correctly ... 
  were they trying to intimidate or stimulate ? 
  red dwarf ruled . 
  fuck that foreign shit !, 
  pabst blue ribbon !, 
  that 's what you 'll drink tonight !, 
  but if the needs of academic publishing were being met by a superior model ( university press or other ) , how could elsevier continue in business ? 
  okay , maybe i 'm confused . 
  are these both articles in the guardian ? 
  or is the other one in foreign policy ? 
  obviously i have looked at research journals , otherwise i would n't bother engaging in this discussion . 
  if you can drop the hyperbole , we can continue discussing . 
  i accept that a university-run press has certain advantages , though i am nevertheless concerned about agency problems . 
  i also accept that journals should be run on a not-for-profit basis . 
  now , can you answer me this : why does elsevier exist ? 
   if i am not wrong , murdoch is currently being investigated for his bid on sky i think his bid is being assessed , rather than him being investigated . 
   pretty ironic for the guardian to claim this , given how the next post in the new queue is an article celebrating how the populist dominoes have been stopped . 
  how is that ironic ? 
  and why is it dependent on the / r/europe ` new ' queue ? 
  calm down . 
  taking the hump day . 
  hump off day . 
   you can have that without needing to have a private company profit of it . 
  you seem to think i 'm defending elsevier , but i 'm not . 
  i 'm simply saying that there needs to be a system that is outside the control of both the government and the universities to ensure proper standards are applied in the assessment of research . 
   if those funding bodies wanted to censor something , they would not pay for it in the first place , so the argument about politization is completely without merit . 
  i disagree . 
  funded research can arrive at conclusions that are not expected or that are unwelcome . 
  since when did evidence have to be definitive ? 
  i 'm arguing in favour of independent assessment and review of research . 
  the problem with a university publishing its own research should be clear . 
  also known as lying , misinformation , fake news , bullshit , nonsense , usw . 
   what kind of mental leap . 
  woah there , you 're the one who is making a mental leap . 
  i responded to a specific question , viz . 
  * why should we feed a 3rd party with tax money ... * you can see this by reading the part of the post i had quoted . 
  i did n't say it was a binary choice , that was the poster i was responding to . 
   you got him there !, 
  busted let 's say you 're trying to catch a train that only runs once a week . 
  you ask me where to get it . 
  i respond : `` your train is on platform 4 , as we speak . '', 
  what do you do ? 
  run to catch the train ? 
  or wait six days because `` as we speak '' means yesterday ? 
  we 're now quibbling over semantics . 
  let 's get back to the crux : 1 . 
  have i provided evidence that cameron appeared to be promising devo max ? 
  yes i have , in the spectator article . 
   why should we feed a third party with tax money to get tax money reviewed papers written by tax money funded researchers ? 
  mostly because we do n't want to politicize academic journals . 
  once you nationalise the journals , the only research that will be published will be research that the government wants publicised .
