  i was just thinking that she should blame god for her unemployment :-), 
   apart from proof-reading what is the contribution of the publisher ? 
  setting up and maintaining a network of reviewers . 
  making sure that standards are adhered to . 
  establishing a reputable brand takes years . 
  i 'm not defending elsevier - i think their prices are exorbitant - but there 's a lot more to it than just collecting a bunch of papers , making a pdf , and uploading it to a website . 
   there are riots on the streets of paris as we speak . 
  `` as we speak '' is normally used to indicate something that 's happening now , not yesterday . 
  and if you think that 's a riot you may have led a sheltered life . 
   the only thing they have is brand recognition of their journals which the individual researchers need for career progression , but does nothing for science in general . 
  i 'm no fan of elsevier but it 's got a lot more than simply brand recognition . 
  it 's well-known for being difficult to work with but it does produce quality journals . 
   in any event `` close to devo max '' is not the same as `` devo max '' . 
  * more or less : * ... close to , ... 
  i fear we will have to agree to disagree , even though i am clearly in the right . 
  ----- * more or less * : speaking imprecisely ; to a certain extent . 
  `` they are more or less a waste of time '' synonyms : approximately , roughly , nearly , almost , close to , about , of the order of , in the region of , give or take a few ; plus-minus ----- i consider my original statement supported by the links i offered . 
  let 's look at the one you chose :  some say david cameron , nick clegg and ed miliband have come close to that . 
  this is fully consonant with my use of * more or less * . 
  let 's look at the spectator article :  the prime minister went further than he has ever done before by promising to devolve more power from westminster to holyrood if scots vote no . 
  again , this is close to promising `` devo plus '' or `` devo max '' . 
  you need to defend the tories ' record on this , but it seems clear to me from outside that some scots have been disappointed by what they perceive as a failure to deliver on the promises made before the last scottish referendum . 
   transexual african dictator idi [ amina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amina ), 
  there once was a poster on reddit who encouraged a waffle to edit it took several takes to fix the mistakes it 's right now , to the waffle 's credit !, 
  that 's charming . 
  fair play to the people standing in the masts and on the stern in that wind . 
   average living standards have been in decline since about 1890 . 
  wtf ? 
  this is somewhat related to a recent tom hardy tv series called [ * taboo * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3647998/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ), 
  coming back to my original statement :  i remember ` devo-max ' being more or less promised a variety of sources support my impression : sky : [ david cameron has pledged new powers for scotland that some have said amount to devo max . 
  however , it 's not quite as clear cut as that . 
  ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/devo-max-what-new-powers-can-scotland-have-10389371 ) spectator : [ mr cameron 's remarks were being seen as a clear hint that the next conservative general election manifesto will contain a commitment to devolve a large chunk of income tax to scotland -- plus other taxes , probably including air passenger duty but not corporation tax . 
  the prime minister has got close to this before but this was the first time he has been so definitive about backing a ` devo plus ' or a ` devo max ' plan for scotland . 
  ] ( https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2014/03/did-david-cameron-just-promise-scots-devo-max/ ) guardian : [ cameron even promised the devo max option he had refused three years before . 
  the scots could have anything . 
  love . 
  money . 
  blue skies . 
  anything but independence . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/18/cameron-devo-max-salmond-referendum-scots-antipathy-tories ) you may argue that it was n't strictly promised , but that 's consistent with what i said originally ( * more or less promised * ) . 
  certainly there was talk prior to the referendum that indicated devo max was a possibility , and cameron was involved in promoting this talk . 
  * sometimes when i 'm watching scandi-noir i imagine that they 're speaking english with a west country accent ( devon etc ) . 
  it 's not far off . 
   as well as football hooliganism thankfully that 's mostly diminished recently . 
   i 've always wondered why it 's so hard to hold a flag or say i love [ blank ] . 
  it 's not so hard . 
  there are many shades of `` patriotism '' and many ways to express it . 
  supporting your national sports team is an expression of pride in your country . 
  it 's completely acceptable so long as your behaviour is reasonable . 
  celebrating le 14 juillet is completely normal . 
  [ town twinning ] ( http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/citizenship/programme/action1_measure1_en.php ) is both patriotic and internationalist ; my local french town has cooperative agreements with an english town and a german town . 
  what an idiot . 
   after spending friday night in a bar with his cousin , ben belgacem was pulled over by police for speeding in the gritty northern paris suburb of garges-les-gonesse , where he lived , just before 7:00 am . 
   he drew a gun and fired , slightly injuring one officer . 
  shortly after , he contacted his relatives to tell them he had `` done something stupid '' , they told police . 
  and then he compounds it by doing something even more stupid and gets himself killed . 
   a perfect deal would be one which captures all possible gains from agreement , including ones neither side thought of at the outset , distributes them in a way which makes the agreement durable and does so whilst improving the relationship and enhancing future cooperation rather than inhibiting it . 
  this is brilliantly expressed . 
  bravo . 
  it 's more than 52 % all the same . 
  it 's strange to me that brexit , the form of which has yet to be clearly defined , could be prioritised by people over the union , which has been in place for centuries . 
  there 's nowt so queer as folk . 
  she saw the result of the rugby match . 
  grand so . 
  i 'll come back to this . 
  on my phone now . 
  was there any significant change after the last referendum ? 
  i remember ` devo-max ' being more or less promised , but did anything materialise ? 
  i 've no problem with the sentiment , just the execution . 
  there are plenty of vainglorious quixotic characters from scottish history to choose from . 
  the trump analogy is just lazy . 
  yes he owned trump when they did the handshake . 
  it 's a very weak analogy that suggests the author is a butthurt sassanach . 
  the wall idea would be more suitable for the english , given their feelings on immigration . 
  moreover , the original wall was built to keep the celts in scotland . 
  a very poor effort indeed . 
   it looks more like another random lunatic who 've had a bad night and who 's just dead , now . 
  that 's one hell of a hangover after paddy 's day . 
  i do n't think this is political , just a dangerously unstable teenager acting out his violent fantasies . 
  i disagree with his father 's politics , but on a human level i feel sorry for what he must be going through after his kid shot up a school . 
  no shortage of lunatics it seems . 
  i feel sorry for the soldier who had to shoot him . 
  sure it 's almost perfect !, 
  i 'm learning italian one of these days . 
  lovely language . 
   this also confirms we can drink tomorrow in honour of saint sheelagh , patrick 's wife , nice one man !, 
  i was wondering why i 'd be drinking tomorrow night - now i know !, 
  lol , cheers !, 
  to be honest i prefer brassens , but when i chose the name one of my kids had been learning champs elys\u00e9es at school . 
  [ tintin in dublin ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1gwxeqlejay/uo7yuzdm1wi/aaaaaaaaaka/lkwrcp6iynw/s1600/tintin+in+dublin+2.jpg ), 
  direct translation : the day of the feast of patrick happy to you ( plural ) . 
  yes objectively speaking it 's the best place ever . 
  st patrick was a gentleman . 
  he came from daycent people he built a church in dublin town , and on it put a steeple his father was a gallagher . 
  his mother was a grady his aunt was an o\u2019shaughnessy . 
  his uncle was a brady the wicklow hills are very high . 
  and so is the hill of howth sir but there 's a hill much higher still . 
  much higher than them both sir on top of this high hill . 
  st patrick preached a sermon drove the frogs into the bogs . 
  and banished all the vermin there 's not a mile of eireann 's isle where dirty vermin musters but there he put his dear fore-foot and murdered them in clusters the frogs went hop and the toads went pop , slapdash into the water the snakes committed suicide to save themselves from slaughter 900,000 reptiles blue he charmed with sweet discourses dined on them in killaloe , in soups and second courses where blind worms crawling in the grass disgusted all the nation down to hell with a holy spell he changed their situation no wonder that them irish lads should be so gay and frisky sure st. pat he taught them that as well as making whiskey no wonder that the saint himself should understand distilling his mother kept a sheebeen shop in the town of enniskillen was i but so fortunate as to be back in munster i 'd be bound that from that ground i never more would once stir there st patrick planted turf , cabbages and praties pigs galore , mo gr\u00e1 , mo stoir , altar boys and ladies .
