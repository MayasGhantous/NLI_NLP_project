  [ -- christy moore singing this with stockton 's wing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7c4ybdpaw8 ), 
  next question . 
  some commentary on politics.co.uk : [ may just handed nicola sturgeon the greatest gift she could ever ask for ] ( http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2017/03/16/may-just-handed-nicola-sturgeon-the-greatest-gift )  may neither blocked nor did n't block . 
  she found a land called ` the worst of all worlds ' and planted her flag on it . 
  she 's prepared to allow scotland to hold the referendum -- that 's implicit by the focus on timing - but be seen to block it until it finally takes place . 
  ...  since the brexit vote , the prime minister has worked tirelessly to conform to the snp stereotype of westminster . 
  they ignored scottish wishes and decided to pull britain out the single market . 
  they dismissed snp efforts to find a way for scotland to stay in . 
  they failed to give them a meaningful role in the great repeal bill overhaul of british law . 
  they threatened to block the devolution of agriculture and fisheries from brussels to edinburgh . 
  sturgeon may as well have written out the script , sent it to may , and have her follow it word for word . 
   scotland ~ ~ willingly ~ ~ reluctantly joined the union under a ~ ~ scottish king ~ ~ threat of bankruptcy, 
  i do n't have a problem with responsible gun ownership . 
  i grew up around guns , plenty of my extended family keep guns , and i 've shot for sport in the past . 
  however , i find the constant whining of the pro-gun lobby tedious in the extreme . 
   france has lots of grenade attacks . 
  what ? 
  since when ? 
  are you thinking of pomegranates ? 
  i did n't know they were the only options available ? 
   do you know anything about northern ireland 's history ? 
  lol . 
  i 'm irish . 
  i have family on both sides of the border . 
  i do n't think it 's up to the assembly . 
  i think it should be up to the people . 
  the dup supported brexit , so it 's clearly out of touch with the wishes of the majority of the people of northern ireland . 
  it even spent mysterious money from some mysterious source to push brexit in britain . 
  why do n't you want the people of northern ireland to be able to express a choice between brexit + uk ( or perhaps just eng + wal ) versus the eu and some sort of federation with roi ? 
  elections are about lots of things . 
  let 's have a clear poll . 
   just because they want to stay in the eu , it does n't mean they prioritise that over staying in the uk . 
  i agree , and in order to establish what they do prioritize , there should be a border poll . 
   why order a poll if the public have n't expressed a wish to change their constitutional status ? 
  on the contrary , the ni public expressed a wish to stay in the eu . 
  london is forcing a change in constitutional status , so the ni public should at least be asked to choose between brexit with the uk versus eu with the roi . 
  you seem to want this to be a catch-22 : the ni secretary wo n't order a poll if there 's no majority in favour of reunification , but the only way to determine whether there 's a majority in favour of reunification is to have a poll . 
  do you admit that there 's no media cover up ? 
   the good friday agreement says that a border poll ** will only be called ** no , it says that the secretary of state ** may order a poll **  if at any time it appears like to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that northern ireland should cease to be part of the united kingdom and form part of a united ireland . 
  that does n't mean that a poll can only be called in those circumstances . 
  other reasons for a poll would be a significant change in the constitution of the uk , or a major revision to the framework on which the gfa is based . 
  is the uk entering into a massive constitutional change ? 
  does the gfa rely on the irish and uk governments being members of the eu and being signatories of the echr ? 
  if you answer yes to either of these , you 're acknowledging that there are grounds for a poll . 
   except they know that there 's no grounds to call one i disagree . 
  the uk is entering into a massive constitutional change , which will undermine the framework on which the good friday agreement was based . 
  there 's plenty of grounds to call a border poll . 
  nothing more boring that rifle nuts . 
  you 're deluded . 
  that video is a recording from a radio show . 
  it starts by discussing something obama said , viz `` trump is rattling world leaders '' . 
  that happened last year [ ( may 26 , 2016 - barack obama has said foreign leaders are `` rattled '' by donald trump ) ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/barack-obama-says-donald-trump-is-rattling-world-leaders ) . 
  ** now , when did the uk media start reporting on rotherham ? 
  ** [ well here 's february 2016 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35670538 ) , from the `` cover up '' bbc . 
  and here 's the `` cover up '' back in [ december 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-35074162 ) you 're engaging in and propagating fantasies . 
  it 's lying and deceitful . 
  you could spend 10 minutes verifying your bullshit instead of spreading it . 
  you 're the problem . 
  bro , do you even enumerate ? 
  we have n't even hit 60 days . 
  the media did n't cover up rotherham ya dope . 
  take it to the_d , they 'll be more interested . 
   did n't know the implications on ... personal data . 
   assumed that the `` open skies '' agreement would be gone davis is such a liability that i sometimes wonder if theresa may is playing a long con to ensure that brexit does n't happen . 
  i mean , between him and disgraced former defense minister , dr liam fox , you 've got to wonder what has inspired her staffing choices if not a plan for future failure . 
  sauternes goes very well with roquefort , but i 'm guessing dick is a little bit less cheesy . 
  perhaps a nice chablis ? 
   but how can you say whether you have or do n't have an issue if you ca n't measure it ? 
  why do n't we have cameras recording everything that happens on every street ? 
  do n't we leave ourselves blind ? 
   if statistics prove that fn is wrong it will ruin their campaign and the topic will disappear . 
  what makes you think the fn or their supporters will respond to evidence ? 
  let 's say you prove that brown people are net economic contributors , the fn will complain about culture being under threat . 
  then you prove that brown people do n't threaten french culture , the fn will complain about traditional values being under threat . 
   why gathering facts is forbidden . 
  because if the government keeps a record of everyone 's ethnicity or religion , an authoritarian government can use that to persecute a minority group . 
   these statements are widely supported by their followers , so , there is no way this will make them unhappy . 
  widely supported by some of their followers , but not all . 
  some of their more recent supporters are `` des cas sociaux '' ( welfare cases ) . 
  they wo n't be happy . 
   beno\u00eet loeuillet shows him ( the journalist ) several books he sells , including books by adolf hitler or robert faurisson , who has been regularly condemned for denying the reality of the shoah . 
  this leader of the fn in nice says at first that he `` does not know what to think of the revisionist thesis '' . 
  `` it 's complicated , but after that , i think there were not as many deaths , there were not 6 million , '' he said . 
   `` there were no mass deaths as it was said , '' he added , citing as a `` proof '' the `` leuchter '' report , named after an american `` hired by robert faurisson '' , according to the historian val\u00e9rie igounet , and who in the late 1980s wrote a document that became a `` reference for negationists . '', 
   in this documentary , we also see philippe vardon , ex-figure of the identitaire ( cultural isolationists ) of nice , now regional adviser to the fn in paca and also member of the campaign team of marine le pen , say ironically during a scene : `` it 's getting worrying : all the guys who shake my hand , they 're black . '', 
  i 'm guessing coq au vin does n't count , huh ? 
   alex salmond described it as such . 
  however , he 's no longer the first minister of scotland , nor the leader of the snp . 
  i 've no issue with that - my personal view is that brexit is a constitutional change of such magnitude that everything is back on the table for discussion , including irish reunification . 
  i 'd rather people were clear on the `` once in a generation '' point though , as a generation is 20 to 30 years , whereas a `` lifetime '' is 70 to 80 years . 
  i watched the interview too . 
  the title seems quite fair . 
  yes that 's correct , it 's the disgraced former defense secretary , dr liam fox . 
  he allowed his friend adam werrity to attend meetings at the ministry of defence ** without first obtaining security clearance . 
  ** werrity had access to fox 's diary , printed business cards announcing himself as his advisor , and even joined him at meetings with foreign dignitaries . 
  [ an investigation by then cabinet secretary sir gus o'donnell found that fox had shown a lack of judgement by blurring the lines between his official role and his personal friendships . 
  his report concluded : `` the disclosure outside the mod of details about future visits overseas posed a degree of security risk not only to dr fox , but also to the accompanying official party . '' ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/02/less-shameless-world-liam-fox-s-career-would-have-ended-2011 ), 
  i ca n't believe the interviewer does n't pull him up on this . 
  she just lets him waffle on . 
  i think it was billed as `` once in a generation '' , which is significantly shorter than a ( non-glasgow ) lifetime ?
