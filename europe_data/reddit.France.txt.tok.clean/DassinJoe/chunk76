  if it 's voluntary i do n't see a problem with testing a pilot scheme . 
  no , there was a clear constitutional difference between britain and ireland throughout recorded history . 
  grand so . 
  ah right , you think you 're being funny . 
  ireland was generally considered a single entity until partition . 
   it 's practically impossible to implement a hard border .

  the uk is entering into a major constitutional change . 
  it 's not just * something happens * ; it 's a massive shift in the makeup of the united kingdom . 
  and when it does , i wo n't have a leg to stand on !,

  there 's a better article in [ liberation ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/france/2017/03/08/incidents-devant-un-lycee-de-saint-denis-huit-jeunes-deferes_1554314 ) three fires were set in the toilets in lyc\u00e9e suger on tuesday . 
  the school was evacuated , and a crowd of 80-100 kids set out for the centre of saint denis . 
  on their way , they set fire to bins , threw stones at police , and damaged property . 
  there were 55 arrests , of which 44 concerned minors . 
  parents were called in and 8 kids will face charges .

  the abortion issue is a complete quagmire in ireland and it needs to be sorted out . 
  first , repeal the constitutional ban ( such things have no place in a constitution ) , then deal with it via clear legislation . 
  beautiful in a fortress of solitude kinda way . 
   is it always like this last time there was strauss-kahn and the new york chambermaid honeytrap . 
  delano\u00eb was an excellent mayor : innovations included paris plage , v\u00e9lib , les nuits blanches , closing the road on the banks of the seine at weekends . 
  cheers , i was going to ask if we had a record of the moves . 
   i could bet my life on it . 
  your life maybe ... but what about a cat 's life ? 
  / joke, 
   will a vote for macron change anything for jules ? 
  he 's had to cancel his past 5 sales , they were going to go through but his customers were from peru and the eu tariff on non-eu countries made the transaction untenable . 
  when did the eu start putting tariffs on exports ? 
  the scoundrels !, 
  if you 're going to head off on flights of fancy , at least try to make a bit of sense . 
  edit . 
  on the subject of steel . 
   ( alan ) became unemployed due to the eu 's inability to stop china dumping cheap steel onto the european market . 
  [ britain blocked attempts to strengthen eu trade defences against imports of cheap chinese steel that have devastated tata steel 's operations in the uk , according to senior european officials .

  you 're welcome . 
  `` black knife '' . 
  well spotted . 
   for someone who carried out a violent crime five attacks ? 
   it appears likely this this is being perpetrated by someone from another culture if there is a single person involved in all of these attacks , it appears very likely to me that we 're dealing with someone who is mentally ill . 
  whether they 're from another culture strikes me as secondary to the fact that they 're crazy . 
  [ in england ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24835910 ) acid attacks appear to be more frequent upon men than upon women . 
   eighty-one male patients were treated in hospital due to corrosive substance assaults in 2012-13 . 
  the figure for women was 49 . 
  these attacks seem intended to humiliate the victim . 
   left voters wont vote for a thatcherite who is nearly as right wing as her . 
  macron and fillon are closer economically than le pen and fillon . 
  but le pen and fillon are closer in social policy than macron and fillon . 
  yeah , true enough . 
  when all you 've got is a hammer , every problem looks like a nail . 
  [ this suggests ] ( http://guillaumevdb.net/babyboom-data.pdf ) that the birth rate/1000 population was lower in ireland ( page 11 ) in the 1860s than it was in the uk ( not sure how uk is defined in this case though , page 20 ) . 
  why the assumption this is religiously motivated ? 
  [ acid throwing - epidemiology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acid_throwing#epidemiology ), 
   however , `` spiegel '' also noted that overall the rate of militants traveling from germany to iraq and syria has declined in comparison to previous years - a likely consequence of the so-called `` islamic state '' ( is ) terrorist group losing its foothold in much of the region . 
  this article is very unclear . 
   and vauxhall is particularly is exposed to this , [ as ] about 80 % of its exports are to the european union . 
  damn that 's heavy . 
   fini la manipulation !, 
  no sense of irony among these stooges .
