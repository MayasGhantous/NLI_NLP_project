  this is fine if you want to run an economy for those aged 18 to 34 ; it 's problematic when your 40 and 50 year olds face job insecurity . 
   `` you 'll never guess what ~ ~ pastry ~ ~ bread pastry is unleavened and made primarily with butter and flour ; bread is usually leavened and primarily water and flour . 
   my reading of the most recent ons reports are than inequality in the uk is decreasing . 
  you confuse `` income '' with `` wealth '' , which is what we were discussing . 
  i 'd be reluctant to read too much into the most recent report , as the previous year 's one says :  estimates of income inequality for 2014/15 are broadly unchanged from those for the previous financial year ( any differences are not statistically significant ) . 
  -----  why would hundreds of thousands of people move to the uk for work every year ? 
  because they can earn over 3 x in a precarious uk job than they would in a * safe * job in their home country . 
  [ the world 's new numbers ] ( http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/spring-2009-decline-or-renewal/the-worlds-new-numbers/ ) from 2009 but worth a read , especially by those who obsess over migration and demographics . 
  * ... the detailed statistical work of demographers tends to seep out to the general public in crude form , and sensationalist headlines soon become common wisdom . 
  * * because of this bastardization of knowledge , three deeply misleading assumptions about demographic trends have become lodged in the public mind . 
  the first is that mass migration into europe , legal and illegal , combined with an eroding native population base , is transforming the ethnic , cultural , and religious identity of the continent . 
  the second assumption , which is related to the first , is that europe 's native population is in steady and serious decline from a falling birthrate , and that the aging population will place intolerable demands on governments to maintain public pension and health systems . 
  the third is that population growth in the developing world will continue at a high rate . 
  allowing for the uncertainty of all population projections , the most recent data indicate that all of these assumptions are highly questionable and that they are not a reliable basis for serious policy decisions . 
   adults , who will produce children ( original 2 becomes 6 people ) fertility rate of muslims in europe is 2.1 . 
  see above . 
  so the original two becomes four . 
  after 20 years , the two kids add two more ( 6 ) . 
  after 20 years , the two kids add two more ( 8 ) . 
  after 20 years , the two kids add two more , but the grandparents die ( 8 ) ... and so on . 
  [ apparently they 're looking for another 6 % cuts ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39110688 ) , but maybe it 's a bait and switch and they 'll announce next year that the planned cuts have been cancelled because everyone 's been so good and brexity . 
   wealth disparity is decreasing in the uk and has been for a few years now . 
  really ? 
  what makes you say that ? 
  from the independent last year : the richest 1 per cent of the population have as much wealth as the poorest 57 per cent combined , according to office for national statistics figures . 
  the agency also found overall wealth inequality has increased since 2012 , mainly thanks to the soaring price of housing in the south-east of england and london . 
  the news came just 24 hours after the head of the government 's child poverty watchdog , alan milburn , warned that britain is in danger of becoming an `` ever-more divided '' society , making a mockery of david cameron 's `` one nation '' rhetoric . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/inequality-richest-one-per-cent-have-as-much-wealth-as-the-poorest-57-per-cent-combined-a6779201.html from the ifs last year : the wealthiest 1 % of households hold about 20 % of household wealth , the top 5 % of hold approximately 40 % , and the top 10 % hold over 50 % of wealth ( see table 1 of alvaredo et al. ) . 
  these authors also find that household wealth in the uk has become more concentrated since the turn of the century . 
  unfortunately , the data available do not permit more concrete statements about the extent to which this is the case . 
  http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8239 from the ft in 2015 : uk wealth inequality widens for first time in a decade the figures will be problematic for the conservative government because they ** break a run of flat inequality measures ** for both income and wealth , and suggest that the tory slogan that everyone is in it together does not hold true . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/1ad5c43a-a593-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58 i 'm interested in the basis for your assertion . 
   as for job security , there is a global trend away from conventional 9-5 employment towards more flexible working , but i think that a lot of people like that trend . 
  certainly a lot of employers love the erosion of workers ' rights , but i 'd assume you agree that there are plenty of people who do n't like the trend away from job security ? 
  my point stands - labour should be able to put together a more appealing platform . 
  i am amazed that british labour can not come up with a persuasive platform in these days of ever increasing wealth disparities , greater job insecurity , and reinforced barriers to social mobility . 
  corbyn is quite useless , but i do n't see how they can get him out if he wo n't resign . 
  presumably this gives the tories a free run for the next ge , so they can continue to impose austerity and presumably privatize anything that might earn their cronies a few quid .

  march 17 is paddy 's day , which is a proxy for irish independence day because we do n't have an official independence day . 
  * sacrifices pigeon , disembowels and pushes entrails around * this augurs well ... ------ anyway , did n't may just say a day or two ago that there 's no need for a new scottish referendum ? 
  for irish i see three , but i 'd have thought four ? 
  nominative , genitive , dative , and ( in a limited sense ) vocative . 
  the rule concerns restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses . 
  a non-restrictive relative clause must always be introduced by * which * and should be separated from the rest of the sentence by commas . 
  a restrictive relative clause can be introduced by * that * or * which * and does not need to be separated by commas . 
  how long are they likely to serve ? 
  i 'm reminded of [ this case ] ( http://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/christopher-coleman-death-disqualified-driver-12648870 ) in dublin recently . 
  killer initially got 2.5 years , but that was appealed by the state and increased to 6 years , with the last 2 years and 9 months suspended . 
   macron wants to push eurozone integration further , notably with the creation of a common investment budget and a joint finance minister . 
  looks like the 2nd round will be a proxy for a referendum on french withdrawal from the eurozone .

  i guess a reference to the german comic that erdogan wanted arrested and tried under some law about insulting heads of state . 
  no , because it 's grotesque humour and the polish one particularly is pushing the limits . 
  but what the fuck business is it of yours what i find funny ? 
  yep , they were that funny !, 
   you can be that special snowflake lol , ca n't you discuss something without resorting to personal attacks ? 
  beauty of conservatism is that it does n't look at gender . 
  it looks at credo . 
  beauty of liberalism is that it does n't look at hair colour . 
  it looks at principles . 
  beauty of libertarianism is that it does n't look at ancestry . 
  it looks at dogma . 
  beauty of nihilism is that it does n't look at eye colour . 
  it looks at ideals . 
  beauty of existentialism is that it does n't look at shoe size . 
  it looks at beliefs . 
  still no attempt at explanation , just ad hominem as usual . 
   * sheer levels of cognitive dissonance * i 'm rubber and you 're glue . 
  you can keep repeating how `` clear '' your original phrasing was , but at this point you realise deep down that it was a meaningless statement . 
  hopefully you 'll express yourself better next time . 
  awesome !, 
  i lolled out loud . 
  there 's a much better version [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tho9-n--k4 ) . 
   the pm is expected to say eu citizens who travel to britain after she triggers article 50 will no longer have the automatic right to stay in the uk permanently . 
  i 'm not a fan of may nor of brexit but this is a logical approach and makes perfect sense . 
  if i decide to go to britain after it has begun the process to leave , i should be aware that i wo n't automatically have the right to stay . 
  what 's reassuring here is that it suggests people who are there now - even those who 've arrived since last june/july - will have the right to stay . 
  ukip remains a farce . 
  the leader recently failed to get elected in stoke , a constituency that voted almost 70 % to leave . 
   beauty of nationalism is that it does n't look at race . 
  it looks at ideology . 
  the beauty of [ define : nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism ) is that it does n't [ look ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/look ) at race . 
  it ^ ^ that ^ ^ is , ^ ^ a ^ ^ political ^ ^ ideology looks ^ ^ looks ^ ^ with ^ ^ eyes , ^ ^ appears ^ ^ to ^ ^ be at ideology . 
  quite simply , it 's gibberish . 
   there is absolutely nothing unclear about that statement . 
  it 's crystal clear to anyone that can comprehend even passable english . 
   if it is unclear to you , do n't look at the language . 
  look at your own ideological world view . 
  lol , the denial is strong with this one . 
  i offered you an interpretation of what you wanted to say several posts back , but you ignored the interpretation . 
  i honestly still do n't know what the fuck you were trying to say . 
  just do as i say , not as i do . 
  again you seek to obfuscate while accusing me of dodging the issue . 
  you made four separate statements and people may agree with the first three while the last one remains meaningless . 
  go ahead and ask a native english speaker to explain what this means :  beauty of nationalism is that it does n't look at race .
