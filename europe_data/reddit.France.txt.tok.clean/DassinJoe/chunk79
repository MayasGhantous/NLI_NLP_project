  it looks at ideology . 
  they will tell you that at best it 's very unclear . 
  just accept it - you wrote something that was meaningless . 
  let it go and move on rather than wasting your time trying to insult me . 
  next time , try to write more clearly and people wo n't criticize you . 
  me also !, 
  i 'm totally worthy of your trust and not a robot fellow humans !, 
  good to see a pintman in the first picture . 
  nice bunch of photos op . 
  my wife 's cousin is stationed in cork with the navy . 
  there was no intentional misunderstanding . 
  you made a statement that means nothing in english . 
  i pointed that out and all the rest is your inability to deal with criticism . 
  ask any native english speaker to read your original sentence ; they 'll tell you the same thing . 
  it does n't mean anything . 
   serious , rigorous german thinkers , such as kant , hegel , marx or heidegger . 
  you 're missing the most important : [ max weber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protestant_ethic_and_the_spirit_of_capitalism ), 
  [ the tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action .

   everyone knew there was going to be a referendum held on the uk 's continued membership of the eu in 2014 can you provide evidence of this ? 
  i thought that was a promise made by cameron before the ge of 2015 . 
   your wet dream of a split uk will disappear i wake up with stained sheets and fleeting , half-remembered images of wales and scotland floating across the irish sea ... 
   you find editing wrong ? 
  not necessarily , but you made a comment and i responded to ** that ** comment . 
  then you edited the comment , so my initial response became somewhat pointless as i was n't addressing everything you said . 
  you can discuss things this way if you want , but it does n't work for me . 
  you initially responded with one line ( ca n't resist ) , so i replied to that . 
  then you added another paragraph to justify stealing . 
  at this point we 're not discussing anything because you edited your comment . 
  nothing 's changed since 2014 then ? 
  there was n't a vote about the future of the uk 's external relations ? 
  one that went one way in scotland and ni but a different way in england and wales ? 
   eu is doomed unless a miraculous miracle takes place . 
  i 'm hoping for a tautological tautology myself . 
  tragedy of the commons . 
  that 's what i thought of too !, 
  now you 're extending the argument . 
  plus you edited your first reply . 
  so it 's human nature for some people to take advantage of a system ? 
   perpetual whining from nationalists winning hearts and minds ... 
   very little is known about crc , the size and make-up of its membership , or its previous links to the dup or northern ireland politics . 
  searches online produce nothing of substance . 
  seems legit ... 
   why does the eu finance stupid , fraudulent small projects ? 
  why are n't hungarians more honest ? 
  * applause *, 
  hooray for eesti !, 
  happy birthday !, 
  my favourite place that i have not visited !, 
  must fix that some day . 
   that 's also different from the actual people making decisions holding that view . 
  of course it is , but you should n't be surprised when you see this viewpoint appearing regularly . 
  if the president says it , it must be ... 
  i dunno ... an alternative fact ? 
  the notion that `` the us has been on the losing side of nafta '' is being promulgated by trump . 
   mother of god . 
  the goal of a trade relationship is not to maintain a trade surplus . 
  i think that misconception stems from the very top in the us these days . 
   the country would have to go back to its pre-1801 name ( kingdom of great britain ) ? 
  would make sense for the olympics , where the uk competes as team gb .

  it did not . 
  good news for the countries these doctors ( might ) move to , not so good for uk if it loses many doctors . 
   the guardian - your daily dose of fearmongering that 's right !, 
  any news article that dares to cast doubt upon the brave new wonderful future of brexit must be dismissed out of hand !, 
  how dare these journalists report on fears expressed by the british medical assocation !, 
  nigel farage has said things will be better !, 
  boris johnson said that britain will be liberated !, 
  theresa may has promised a red white and blue brexit !, 
  the bma should be silenced !, 
  it should not be allowed to survey its members for risk they might talk down brexit !, 
  the guardian should be closed !, 
  how dare it publish something that might cause concern about the future !,

  [ article in the belfast telegraph ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/one-in-three-firms-looking-to-partrelocate-overseas-amid-brexit-uncertainty-35475157.html ) about the same study :  ** one in three firms ` looking to part-relocate overseas amid brexit uncertainty ' **  research by finance firm kpmg found that two thirds of companies had no plans to move , while two out of five were undeterred by the referendum vote and do not believe it will make it harder to recruit staff . 
   a survey of more than 200 senior staff in manufacturing firms showed that most believed financial support from the government was needed to help them increase investment in new technology . 
   karen briggs , head of brexit at kpmg , said : `` when our survey was carried out in january , two thirds of respondents expected uncertainty around brexit . 
  however britain 's makers are an especially resolute group . 
   `` although some are concerned about exchange rates , labour pressures and higher indirect taxation , they are also taking a range of practical measures to prepare . 
   `` these include partial relocation , supply chain management , increased business development , and new sources of financing . 
   `` uk manufacturers realise that brexit will demand a burst of innovation from both the private and public sectors if the uk is really going to reach new global markets and deliver on its potential . '',

  [ books get burned in many places ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_book-burning_incidents ) and for various reasons . 
  it 's retarded like i said , but it 's often individuals or groups burning books to make a point . 
  not every book burning is a nazi ( state-sponsored ) book burning . 
  blasphemy laws enforce a state position on religion . 
  the music is weaving, 
  yes , more specifically , your gran 's ass . 
  burning books is retarded , but blasphemy laws are another level of abject stupidity . 
  brave young people , requiescat in pace . 
  you accuse me of : * ideological fanaticism * disingenuousness / deceitfulness * emotional response and inability to deal with facts/logic all because i pointed out that your statement was meaningless . 
  did it ever occur to you that the issue might be your ability to express yourself ? 
  there 's a list including some irish words here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_galician_words_of_celtic_origin the [ `` book of invasions '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebor_gab%c3%a1la_%c3%89renn ) , though primarily mythology , does talk about a settlement of ireland by milesians ( m\u00edl esp\u00e1ine from miles hispaniae ) .

  farms are by definition productive . 
  farms staffed by robots require fewer people to run them . 
  thus , the countryside gets even more depopulated ( a long term trend since the 1700s ) .
