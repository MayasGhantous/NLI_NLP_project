  * state certification of religious leaders . 
  no more allowing any tom , dick , or achmed to set up his own community . 
  * `` radical '' prisoners isolated in french prisons . 
  do n't allow them to influence others . 
  here 's the website of the [ mus\u00e9e de l\u2019arm\u00e9e ] ( http://www.musee-armee.fr/programmation/expositions/detail/napoleon-a-sainte-helene-la-conquete-de-la-memoire.html ) with some more detail and a short video ( pages is in french as the english version is n't available ) .

   furthermore , fuck islam . 
  stop oppressing people with bullshit fairy-tales .

   a headscarf is not a burqa . 
  it 's a headscarf . 
  yeah i know . 
  i was just pointing out that france has rules about what can be worn in public . 
  my own preference is that we all choose for ourselves how we dress ... except my younger son , who will insist on wearing shorts in winter and snow boots in summer . 
   not a single muslim would remove their headscarf when coming to europe , why must we comply ? 
  there have been cases of women fined for wearing the burqa in france . 
   tariq ramadan ... puts himself forward as a man of dialogue , someone open to a debate . 
  a debate about secularism which , according to him , needs to ** adapt itself to the new place taken by religion ** in western democracy . 
  a secularism and a democracy which must also accept those traditions imported by minority communities . 
  yeah that 's the problem right there . 
  it took european countries centuries to develop secularist societies ( in many parts of europe the process is incomplete ) ; we ca n't throw that away to accommodate a `` new place taken by religion '' . 
  basically the `` new place '' is very similar to the `` old place taken by religion '' that took such a long time to get rid of . 
  yes , i find this distracting . 
  the [ international brigades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_brigades ) fighting for the republicans in the spanish civil war are fairly well known ; perhaps less well-known are the international volunteers [ fighting for the nationalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_spanish_civil_war#nationalist_foreign_volunteers ) . 
  ibrahim el bakraoui was sentenced to 9 years in 2010 for shooting at police ... then turkey picked him up in 2015 and deported him because he was a suspected militant islamist . 
  but in europe we lost track of him when no links to terrorism were established . 
  this guy should have set off every alarm bell imaginable . 
  how did he get released so soon after shooting at police ? 
  wtf ?

  i 've known lots of students who worked in the us under fake social security numbers though , and i 've met a few people who 've lived and worked there illegally for years . 
  i 'd have thought the us would rank higher than germany . 
   what 's amazing is that two guys will just go out of their way to kill someone two guys ? 
  i thought there was just one ? 
  he certainly went out of his way : 320 kilometres from bradford to glasgow . 
  apparently shah had been threatened online previously . 
  hopefully the police will find everyone involved .

  [ * sipah-e-sahaba * on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sipah-e-sahaba_pakistan )  the organisation was banned by president pervez musharraf in 2002 as a terrorist organisation under the anti-terrorism act of 1997 . 
  in march 2012 , the government of pakistan banned sipah-e-sahaba again . 
  the supreme court of pakistan removed this ban in november 2014 . 
  i do n't understand the rating for alcohol in france . 
  the 10 points for `` other '' is explained by a `` full ban on promotions '' , but i see promotions on beer regularly in supermarkets and bars . 
  this guy 's a dangerous loon . 
  did they only need a teeny tiny proportion of votes to have it recognized ? 
  hmm , she 's allowed no nuance whatsoever whereas defenders of the ` veil ' can choose between the levels of covering ( 15 % - 90 % ) that they consider acceptable for women ? 
  fuck that . 
  her words may be clumsy , but i 'm with her . 
  in fact the [ independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/after-asad-shahs-religiously-prejudiced-death-we-know-inter-muslim-hatred-is-a-problem-in-britain-a6955146.html ) piece predates murray 's and makes several of the same points . 
  the main innovation of murray 's piece is to have a go at nicola sturgeon and sadiq khan . 
   but since he was a muslim the story has now effectively gone dead . 
  the media are n't that interested in follow-up really ? 
  a cursory search yields articles in the mirror , the guardian , the express , all published in the last 12-24 hours . 
  there 's even a piece on muslim vs. muslim hate crimes in the independent . 
  the claim that newspapers have lost interest because it 's muslim against muslim is simply unsustainable . 
   sure , then do n't buy it or read it . 
  or should we forbid bad taste , mr dictator ? 
  lol , i have a subscription , and i read it , and i like it . 
  but i can still recognize that it 's in bad taste . 
  that 's part of the charm . 
  or should we forbid the expression of opinions , mr kneejerkreactionary ? 
   in december 2013 , professor ruud koopmans of the berlin social science center published a study on `` fundamentalism and out-group hostility , '' in which he compared hostility among ** muslim immigrants ** with hostility among ** christian natives ** in western europe . 
  is his study on people who have recently immigrated , or on the children/grandchildren of immigrants ? 
   they actually have to think and interpret also for themselves yes , it 's in bad taste and it also has multiple layers of meaning . 
  there 's a bit more detail on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micro_bit ) . 
  it looks interesting - the accelerometer and magnetometer should encourage interactive projects , hopefully sparking some creativity . 
  i 'd hope that teachers can build some classes around the devices too . 
  at a regular wine store the last time i was in los angeles . 
  maybe the neighborhood was expensive . 
  californian wine has never seemed like a bargain to me . 
  washington state seems to have better value . 
   in each instance , officials failed to catch -- or at least to flag to colleagues -- the men 's ties to the nascent islamic state . 
  that 's deeply worrying . 
  these guys are getting away with a lot more than they should because of poor intelligence work . 
  but the same does not seem to be true for napa valley . 
  even in california the cheapest bottle of napa valley will be over $ 10 . 
   ireland 's ^ ^ caretaker leader  are you saying the ^ ^ caretaker head of ireland 's ^ ^ caretaker government should n't answer questions about ireland economy . 
  not really , no . 
  i 'm saying that no matter what people outside the uk say , there are sections of the uk press that will depict it as outside interference . 
  it 's clear that brexit is an emotional issue for many of its supporters . 
  they do n't have a proper idea of what 's going to happen afterwards , so appealing to reason with respect to northern ireland , the border , the peace process , etc. 
  is pointless . 
  this core brexit support deals in emotions , not facts . 
  as such , presenting any outside view , no matter how rooted in facts and data , will be met with hostility . 
  that 's why i think we should just let them get on with it . 
  data from the closest three towers gets a fairly exact position on a given sim card . 
  molenbeek is urban , so i 'd guess there are three towers available ( assuming the message was sent from there ) . 
   a $ 20 french wine will usually be excellent . 
  i spend about $ 10 per bottle for good wine ; $ 5 per bottle for drinkable but unremarkable french wine . 
  yes it 's a prepaid phone according to the article . 
  but if they know it 's a phone , do n't they know what cells it has been using ? 
  sure , but sharing is already bad . 
  if brexit happens , realistically the uk goes down the priority list for other eu countries . 
   i 'd say france ( the southern coast , you wo n't die from freezing there ) . 
  i used to live in the centre of paris and we had a few guys who 'd hang out on the corner of the street drinking cans all day .
