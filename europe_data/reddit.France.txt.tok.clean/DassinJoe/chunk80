   if you make rural areas productive there will always be people willing to live and work . 
  this is not what has happened . 
  productivity from land has probably increased throughout the last 200 years while rural populations have decreased throughout the same period . 
  why will that change ? 
  neither of them would have had much electoral success if it was n't for the eu .

   london is something like frances 6th largest city . 
  decent of you chaps to hand over your former capital like that . 
  very decent . 
   spanish is not so much more distant to english than french no , i disagree . 
  french influence on english is huge . 
  boris johnson : brexit 's sad clown . 
  that stuff is based on religion . 
  the rangers fans would be fine with irish protestants . 
  true , but automation depopulates the countryside still further . 
  i 'm not sure that it 's the best outcome for farming in general . 
  afaik , the nfu has been consistently anti brexit , even though many farmers have been pro-brexit . 
  can anyone explain the irish-portuguese connection ? 
  i thought galician would be more likely . 
  i doubt it would arise ? 
  the pope has standards ; if you do n't meet those standards , you wo n't get into the audience chamber . 
  here 's the grand mufti [ in poland ] ( http://www.bejrut.msz.gov.pl/resource/207a9a14-5f04-4131-94ae-83bfa661b5c5:jcr ) , with a woman , and her head is n't covered !, 
  but he was photographed with her !, 
  do you think he agreed to be photographed but refused to speak to her ? 
  le pen cancelled the meeting , not the grand mufti . 
  she plays people so easily , and you all lap it up . 
  the article is about a headscarf not a veil . 
  a headscarf covers the hair , a veil covers the face . 
  the article is about lebanon not other places . 
  try harder . 
  lol . 
  i * think * what you 're trying to say is : the beauty of nationalism is that it is ideologically rooted ( or based on a person 's ideology ) rather than racially rooted ( or based on a person 's race ) . 
  but the way that you expressed it is meaningless . 
   words have specific definitions . 
  consider using them , instead of pretending that they mean nothing next time . 
  words not only have definitions , they also have * common usage * . 
  if you make up your own way to use words , people wo n't understand you .

   you would be surprised at the retardations 3rd wave feminists are spewing . 
  i 'm in my fifth decade on this earth , and third decade using the internet . 
  not much surprises me . 
  we 've always had people with extreme ideas looking for attention , and this * paul watson versus feminism * is a social media circlejerk . 
  more people are exposed to this nonsense , but most people hopefully retain the use of their critical faculties . 
  i post about all sorts of things . 
  it 's not quite the same as recording 30 videos about feminism . 
   `` bashing on feminists '' is a whole youtube / twitter niche . 
   hold the straits against any individual country in the mediterranean yeah , that 's my gut feeling too . 
  yeah , but if a guy posts 30 videos to youtube harshing on feminists , i start to think that this guy is unduly afraid of and obsessed by feminism . 
  some of it might merely be attention seeking , but deep down he must feel very inadequate . 
  here 's some more detail : http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/most-toxic-countries?_ga=1.77781780.1457752045.1487693905 methodology is very questionable imo .

   and time before that police '' electrocuted perpetrator and that caused riots '' . 
  eh , those kids jumped into the substation . 
  the police did n't electrocute anyone . 
  in contrast , the latest case is police brutality . 
   it looks at ideology . 
  what ? 
  that does n't mean anything . 
  it 's like saying `` it looks at philosophy '' or `` it looks at theory '' .

  what ? 
  the elections are two months away . 
  already 62 % of people are * quite interested * or * very interested * at this early stage . 
  turnout was about 80 % last time , so we should expect another 18 % or so to become interested during the next two months . 
  frankly , many people have more to do with their time than obsess over politics a full two months before a vote . 
   edit . 
  what is even more disturbing is that 38 % of the french are `` little to not at all interested '' in the elections ... ... ... 
  it is still months away, 
  if i use racist language and gestures , that makes me a racist , pretty much by definition . 
  there 's no need to overthink this . 
  they 're not racist if they support black players on their own team and just hurl abuse at black players on other teams ? 
  you might want to rethink your analysis . 
   is life in france truly better than life in switzerland or norway or canada ? 
  i think it depends on what you 're looking for . 
  i 've lived in canada ( east coast ) and finland ; both fine places but the weather is not very much to my liking . 
  programmed well , he could of certain measures benefit . 
  yeah , but there was n't anything on the news because nothing specific happened in sweden . 
  there was a piece on tucker carlson 's show , but it 's not * nightly news * . 
  if this is the explanation , it suggests trump thinks everyone ( in this age of netflix , torrents , etc ) is watching tv with him , in his living room . 
  the illustrious bot chose the best option he could of those on display . 
   ( and an assumption some in the audience saw the segment ) that 's a bizarre assumption to make . 
   tino shuts down those attempts and points to very real problems where ambulance and police ca n't go in without being stoned . 
  that 's not a normal situation .
